Welle, DVM, Dipl ABVP Although people have been sharing their homes and lives with pet parrots for the past 2000 years, only recently have most pet-bird owners started to realize the potential of these amazing creatures. Originally, birds appealed to humans because of their bright plumage and capacity to imitate human speech. Today, parrots are increasingly recognized as complex, intelligent, and highly social animals. Many parrots are hand raised by humans, making them much more integrated into their human flocks. Like any other animal, parrots are susceptible to several behavioral and psychological disorders. With the exception of the domesticated species such as budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), lovebirds (Agapornis species), and cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus), most psittacine birds are only one or two generations from the wild state. They still retain many natural behaviors that help them survive and succeed in the wild but can make it difficult for them to cope with life in captivity. Understanding the bird's perspective can help bird owners provide a more appropriate environment and social setting for pet parrots. The life of wild parrots usually starts in dark cav- ities. They are still very embryonic at hatching; their eyes are closed, their ears may be closed, they have no feathers, and they know nothing except how to beg for food. They feel physical contact with their warm clutchmates and parents. They are fed frequent, small meals throughout the day. Physical- ly, they grow and mature rapidly, achieving adult size in a matter of weeks. Behaviorally and intel- lectually, however, they continue to learn from their parents for several years before they are completely independent. In this time, they establish their social status and learn how to interact with other birds. They learn what and how to eat, how to find food, how to recognize and avoid predators, how to main- a This report is adapted from the Psittacine Behavior Handbook (1999).3 tain their feathers, and many other important sur- vival skills. When they reach sexual maturity, they choose a mate, form a pair bond, defend their nest, and reproduce. The cycle then starts again. Contrast the life of wild parrots with that of hand- fed parrots. Hand-fed parrots are still usually hatched in a dark cavity. But then they are moved into a relatively bright brooder and are sometimes left alone for long periods. They are taken out briefly, fed enor- mous amounts of liquid food, and returned to the brooder. When they are older, they have food laid in front of them. They are not challenged in their social interactions, often rising to the top of the pecking order as adolescents. They have no foraging chal- lenges and no survival tasks to learn, and they are alone more than they are with their flock. When they become sexually mature, they choose a person as a mate, but that person has another mate. They fight for the mate, but even though they appear to have won, the mate is angry and confines them. It is not surprising, therefore, that parrots sometimes develop behavioral problems. Most people expect too little of birds and under- estimate their pet potential. Millions of budgerigars sit unattended in small cages without any social in- teractions or exercise. They are looked upon as noisy, messy decorations that are replaced every 3 to 4 years when they die. Worse yet, some are thought of as stepping-stones to "real parrots." These owners have no idea that these little creatures are intelligent, social animals. As a result, many be- come vicious biters. Some panic when hands come near them and are, in general, miserable. At the oth- er end of the spectrum are owners who expect par- rots to behave like humans or domesticated animals. They are given too many liberties, no limitations, and no guidance, and they soon learn to rule the roost. Avian veterinarians frequently witness the re- sults of these problems first hand. The stresses of captive life frequently result in the medical prob- lems seen on a daily basis. In addition, bird owners 190</page><page sequence="2">WELLE-BEHAVIOR SERVICES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE 191 look to veterinarians for advice about everything from nutrition to behavior. Few avian veterinarians hesitate to offer nutrition counseling, despite the fact that they are not nutritionists. Somehow, be- havior has been a problem that has frightened away veterinarians because of its complexity. If, however, behavior is viewed as another system of the body, with its own anatomy, physiology, and clinical ap- proach, it becomes less daunting. First, Do No Harm Hippocrates' simple quote says volumes. Not only are veterinarians in a position to do a tremen- dous amount of good, they are also in a position to severely damage the human-avian bond. Rough, careless handling in the examination room, inade- quate pain management, or other traumatic experi- ences can leave a sensitive bird terrified of people. One of the benefits of learning more about avian behavior is that the information can be taken into the examination room. By learning good handling techniques, the restraint and examination process can be much easier and less stressful to the bird. Tame birds are often taken out of the carrier be- fore the veterinarian enters the room. Rather than chasing it around the room with a towel, the bird can be placed close to the body or in a small, en- closed area before it is wrapped in a towel. When birds are restrained, they should be held more ver- tically than horizontally.' Talking to the bird during the examination can be calming. The restraint pe- riod should be kept as short as possible by having everything prepared before restraint. For birds that are difficult to catch initially, as much as possible should be done at one time. For others, it is best to use short restraint periods with rest in between. Care should be taken that wing trimming is done prop- erly. Excessive wing trims can lead to clumsy, in- jury prone birds. Pain management is also critical. This is a situation where anthropomorphism is ap- propriate. If a procedure or condition would warrant anesthesia or analgesia in a person, it does so in a bird as well. There is no justification for withhold- ing analgesia. When hospitalizing birds, be sure to place them in an upper cage bank, especially very frightened birds. When placed in lower cages, birds have to look up at everyone and feel very threat- ened. Birds should always be kept where they do not see or hear predatory animals. Taking the Plunge Most veterinarians and staff members will have to spend some time studying avian behavior before offering behavior services. Unfortunately, much of the information available about the subject is fraught with anecdotes and unsubstantiated opin- ions. Much of what is available, however, is sensi- ble information. For the past few years, an entire section has been devoted to behavior at the Asso- ciation of Avian Veterinarians Annual Conference and Expo. In addition to reading, it is critical for the prospective avian behavior consultant to ob- serve, handle, and interact with unrestrained birds regularly. Just as critical is the observation of hu- man nature and how people interact with birds. If the veterinarian or staff member is not willing or able to devote this time, behavior cases should be referred to an outside behaviorist. Even if a certain amount of work is done in house, there may be times when the veterinarian feels a bird may benefit from referral to a behavior consultant or to a veterinary behaviorist. Unfortunately, there are very few veterinary behaviorists, and still fewer that are experienced with birds. Bird behavior consultants are a good option for referrals, but there are few standards to which they must conform. Before refer- ring to a consultant, references and credentials should be checked, and if possible, the behaviorist should be interviewed to be sure that their methods are compatible with the practice philosophy. In ad- dition, make sure that a thorough health evaluation of the bird has been completed before referral. The next challenge is to market behavior services in a way that helps clients without crippling the vet- erinary hospital. People are always willing to ask questions about their birds' behavior. However, they expect immediate answers and do not expect to pay for them. Some questions are very straightforward and can be answered easily and quickly. Others take a lot of time and can be costly for a practice unless the owners are charged for the consultation. Charg- ing for behavior counseling takes some skill and some prior planning. When owners ask for advice, they should be informed that a thorough history and a substantial amount of time are required to do their question justice. A questionnaire can be sent home with them or mailed to them. The questionnaire should state that an appointment time will be re- quired and that a fee will be charged for this con- sultation. Whereas not every client will want to pro- ceed with this paid consultation, at least those that do will be given proper attention, and the veteri- narian will not spend expensive time giving over- simplified answers to complicated questions. Behavior Classes One simple service that can be easily introduced into the veterinary hospital is a behavior class for</page><page sequence="3">192 JOURNAL OF AVIAN MEDICINE AND SURGERY owners and their birds.2 A sample course is avail- able through the Association of Avian Veterinarians in the Psittacine Behavior Handbook.3 By giving bird owners early insight and instruction, many be- havior problems can be prevented. Behavioral Diagnostics Whereas taking a good history is stressed for nearly every aspect of veterinary medicine, it is re- ally the only diagnostic option in behavior medi- cine. It is therefore critical that the history be ac- curate and thorough. No tests will catch the omis- sions of the history. The history should be done in a way that is consistent; each question should be asked every time. It is important that the questions are neither leading nor accusing. If clients perceive that a certain response is desired or feel guilty, they may alter their story. Some important facts to as- certain include the bird's source, environment, diet, social interactions, and of course, behavioral prob- lems. It is also important to find out what the own- ers are doing in response to these problems. It is useful to give clients a survey form to fill out before the consultation. Interviewing the owners during the behavior consultation augments the standardized form. The behavior of the bird and the owner should be closely watched during the interview. If the in- terview is conducted at the veterinary hospital or by telephone, the owner should be asked to provide a videotape of the bird's behavior at home. Birds often behave differently at home than they do in unfamiliar territory. Home visits are ideal, but few veterinarians will have the time to do this on a reg- ular basis. Some problems that are likely to have behavioral causes include aggression, excessive fear, excessive vocalization, feather picking, and self-mutilation. The difference between behavioral disease and or- ganic disease is an indistinct line. The clinical signs of depression can be caused by many physical con- ditions, but depression can also be a behavioral dis- ease. Most other behaviors commonly discussed as behavioral disorders can also have a multitude of physical causes. All behaviors are neurochemically mediated as well. Traditionally, once a diagnosis of a behavioral cause of a problem has been made, veterinarians make no attempt to further define this category. Successful resolution of these problems, however, requires a more specific diagnosis. Since veterinary patients cannot be interviewed to deter- mine what this problem is, diagnosis can be diffi- cult. Veterinary behavior specialists have begun to name and categorize some common behavioral problems in dogs and cats. To make these diagno- ses, certain criteria must be met. This is far from an exact science, but if defined criteria are used, the comparison of different cases will become easier. Usually, the diagnosis is a theory that is then tested by the treatment protocol chosen to treat the given problem. Behavioral Therapeutics Behavioral modification takes a commitment from the veterinarian and the bird owner. The vet- erinarian should plan to spend a minimum of an hour to adequately evaluate and discuss a behavior problem. Owners should be given reasonable ex- pectations and clear instructions. Written treatment protocols should be provided. Owners are often emotional, feeling guilty, or otherwise distracted during the consult. The written treatment sheet al- lows them to retain much more of the information. Supportive care is critical when treating any dis- order. The same is true with behavioral problems. In behavior therapy, supportive care involves the correction of the physical and social environment of the bird. Any stress, whether or not it can be di- rectly related to the behavioral disorder, should be reduced or eliminated. Basic training of the bird is essential as well. Owners that cannot even handle their birds will have much difficulty in following the treatment plan. This behavioral supportive care is often all that is needed for some minor problems. There are many types of behavior modification techniques. It sometimes requires a bit of ingenuity to successfully incorporate these methods into a plan of action. Table 1 is a brief glossary of behav- ioral modification terminology. Some rules should be observed when selecting treatments. First and foremost is that nothing that hurts or frightens the bird should be used. Punishments should be no more than stern looks, verbal reprisals, or possibly repetitive step-up exercises or laddering. Second, most undesirable behaviors are only intermittently reinforced; therefore, extinction is a very slow and sometimes ineffective treatment. Finally, whatever methods are chosen, adequate time should be given for the methods to have an effect. Generally, at least 6 to 8 weeks should be allowed before dismissing a program as ineffective. The exception to this, of course, is when the treatment results in a dramatic increase in the stress level of the bird. In some cases, behavior modification can be fa- cilitated by the use of psychotropic drugs. Care should be taken that these drugs are not simply used to dull the signs of deeper problems. A good anal- ogy is anesthesia and surgery. While anesthesia will not repair a broken wing, it greatly facilitates the</page><page sequence="4">WELLE-BEHAVIOR SERVICES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE 193 Table 1.

Likewise, drugs are not likely to correct a behavioral disorder. They simply make it easier to accomplish the behavioral modification. Every effort should be made to for- mulate a behavioral diagnosis and to develop a ra- tional program by using behavioral modification. If the behavioral modification is impossible or too stressful alone, drugs can be considered. A thorough medical workup should precede the use of any of these drugs, and periodic monitoring should contin- ue as long as the patient is receiving the drug. Tracking Results Rarely do behavioral problems simply stop. To prevent frustration by the owners, it is helpful to log the incidence of the problem behavior. If a re- duction in frequency or severity of the behavior can be tracked, the success or failure of a program can be determined. Follow up is critical to the further development of this budding field. Determining the success rates of well-documented treatment proto- cols for clearly described behavioral disorders will allow greater understanding of how these difficult problems can be prevented and treated.
