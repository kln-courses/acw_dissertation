<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WISCONSIN TESTS OF GRAMMATICAL CORRECTNESS S. A. LEONARD The purpose of this study was to find how many pupils in a hundred in various school grades make certain commonly cen- sured "grammatical errors" of purely conventional sort like "them kind" and "learn us," and to enable schools to find out the same thing specifically for themselves. For this it was necessary to con- struct a purely objective measure as near as possible to a real situ- ation in which children would use the wrong or the right form. Many considerations, the validity of which will be discussed in the completed study, determined the use of the completion or blank- filling test, and it proved possible to construct such a test in which 97.5 per cent, on the average, of all pupils in junior and senior high schools filled in either the wrong form or the right form we were looking for in every sentence. As a result, though no test is prob- ably very good as an indication of what children or others use in speech or even in their own writing, we have a clear measure of knowledge of the right form; there is shown here what several thousand children, knowing that a word is wanted in a sentence, do actually write in that sentence in schoolrooms, how many of them know and can command the right form, and how many use the wrong. Since the forms are not there to choose, but the sense of the sentence naturally suggests the word to which the child is ac- customed, it is probable that the element of chance is pretty well eliminated and that we find out the best of the pupil's knowledge and belief. Results of these tests.-(I) Pupils from grades VII to XII showed rather steadier improvement in the grammatical correct- ness tests, particularly in Test A, which was the harder and was taken as the standard in revision, than in the sentence recognition tests. They also had a higher initial median and came nearer to 430</page><page sequence="2">THE WISCONSIN TESTS 431 perfect attainment in the last year of high school in grammatical correctness (Table II and Fig. I). 2. The scores by sentences made possible a ranking of all er- rors examined, from 32.I per cent to I.3 per cent wrong (Table III).

The table of frequencies of the errors examined in this test, like that for the sentence tests, should aid school authorities to plan inventories of composition difficulties and organize courses of study to meet them. 3. A use of the sentence recognition and grammatical correct- ness tests in measuring the graduating classes of county training schools made clearer than could otherwise have been possible the inadequacy of these people's preparation on the average for teach-</page><page sequence="3">432 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL ing in elementary schools. The tests were also applied and the re- sults digested as part of the Racine Survey. 4. A supplementary study which can be only briefly mentioned in this article attempted to discover the effect of presenting wrong forms or a choice of right and wrong forms in a test of grammatical correctness. This was studied by presenting three tests, each of 21 sentences, in which both the right and the wrong form (Test Al- pha), the wrong form alone (Test Beta), and merely a blank to be filled in (Test Gamma) were presented before the pupil, thus: Alpha: "Every pupil must do (his) (their) own work in this test." (wrong form to be crossed out) Beta: "Every pupil must do their own work in this test."--- (correct form to be written in at end) The result of giving these tests to 1,850 pupils was (i) corre- lations so low that the tests cannot be said to measure these abil- ities evenly: .482+.o016 for Alpha with Beta; .603+.013 for Beta with Gamma; .677+.0II Alpha with Gamma; (2) most remark- ably uneven results on individual sentences, as illustrated in Plate II, for 750 pupils' scores on these tests taken in different orders to equalize chances; obviously nothing is proved about the effect of displaying wrong forms in tests and further studies are needed to explain these figures; and (3) a reasonably clear indication that Test Gamma-the completion type-is on the whole the steadiest measure of the abilities here considered, since the scores on indi- vidual sentences by it vary the least from the average sentence scores on all three tests; the Alpha deviations are so prevailingly minus that there is strong probability that the guessing factor makes this type of test too easy, and the large total of deviations on Beta, with the fact that in many sentences perfectly correct forms were corrected in place of the wrong one (by 21.3 per cent of the pupils in one sentence), makes this test apparently less steady in indication than the completion type. These figures are given in Table I. While the right-wrong or alternate-response (Alpha) type appears to have little to be said for it as a measure of these abilities, the type presenting an error to be corrected (Beta), provided all variant responses are collected and analyzed as with the completion test, was shown to reveal other and important mat-</page><page sequence="4">THE WISCONSIN TESTS 433 ters of significant value, discussed in full in the completed study. A test of a number of sentences on this type, some right and some wrong, best on a single form, is likely to show much of diagnostic value.

The total differences were Alpha 91.4, Beta 113.2, and Gamma 87.2. Gamma's total differences are thus 94.3 per cent of Alpha's and 77.0 per cent of Beta's. But of the total differences above, 83.8 of Alpha's or approximately 93 per cent, are minus; this apparently confirms Dr. Ruch's and others' conten- tion that the chance element in this test throws strong doubt on its validity. What errors should be measured?-The first step in the con- struction of the tests of grammatical correctness was to examine all studies previously made on this sort of errors. Most of these are summarized in Dr. Charters' chapter on "Language and Gram-</page><page sequence="5">434 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL mar" in the Third Yearbook of the National Education Associa- tion on Research in Constructing the Elementary School Curricu- lum. These studies, where they have specified the precise form misused and not concealed it under the heading "errors in princi- pal parts of verbs," have been most useful in showing where trou- ble centers. Stormzand has also given a good review of such stud- ies and made a beginning of deriving index numbers by finding quotients of frequency of errors.' All data show us that a few wrong forms constantly repeated, and not so multitudinous an array as had been supposed, constitute the bulk of the problem. On the other hand, practically all such investigations have in- cluded not alone matters merely of sometimes poor courtesy like the word-order "I and Mary," but rhetorical niceties like the split infinitive, and altogether correct and idiomatic colloquial forms such as "have got" and "go slow." And not one had ever brought out the special and evil prominence of such a form as "my hair are," which was included in these tests only because I had met it so constantly, and which came out positively at the top of the fre- quency with 32.I per cent of error. It is, of course, clear that this is a usage of foreign importation; but these tests were given over a wide area, from New Jersey to Colorado, and we have plenty of other evidence that idioms of foreign speech and their inevitable effect upon English are certain always to form fundamental prob- lems of English teaching in the United States. It was therefore thought by all means best for the purposes of these tests to include no idiomatic and colloquial forms which are rated correct by the latest complete dictionaries of English, as yet almost the only widely accessible authorities which have made at least an attempt to investigate actual cultivated usage. Since, as in the sentence recognition tests, the purpose of the study was to discover the frequency of comparatively gross forms only, it was further determined to exclude all cases of divided usage, generally condemned by grammarians but widely and freely used by really cultivated speakers of English, such as "It is me," "Who is it for?" Much as we may dislike these, there are plenty of 'Stormzand and O'Shea, How Much English Grammar?, Warwick and York, 1925, pp. 175 ff.</page><page sequence="6">THE WISCONSIN TESTS 435 more grossly illiterate and objectionable forms such as "have went," "I done it," and "ain't had none." Moreover, these worst forms have been shown in several studies to be more frequent than the disputed matters of pronoun case.2 If we can actually and com- pletely dispose of the flagrant offences, we may wash our hands and at our leisure attack the lesser ones if we still think we need to. them ror,in B and G,those.kind) A .36.6 one....... were A 216.0 8 6 -~ r lrr 6 had ou,ht~ B 52.6 like for as F A i n ff .

"Have got" versus "haven't no" and "I seen": A remarkable illustration of the way in which our school instruction has inverted emphasis was found in the lists of variant forms tabulated for each sentence of the correctness tests. In each test there was a sentence on this pattern: John said that he - no time to play just then. Either one or two words might be written in. Of course we wanted to discover whether a second negative like "hadn't" would be in- serted; and in fact such a form was used by, on the average, 3.7 per cent of the more than four thousand pupils who took these tests. In addition, absurd and grossly incorrect forms like "laid," 2 All instances of "predicate nominative in wrong case," for example, including "it is me," are shown by Stormzand and O'Shea, from the figures of previous studies, as 2 in 3,453 errors or o.6 per cent (.oo6).

Op. cit., Table 90, pp. 170-72.</page><page sequence="7">436 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL "had has," "knows its," and "seen" occurred sporadically. But not one paper in all the thousands contained the perfectly correct form "had got." Nothing could so completely illustrate the perfection with which elementary-school teachers have strained out this par- ticular gnat. Meanwhile, the number of camels that have got in and the extent of their possession of our tent are shown in the re- mainder of this article. Making a completion test valid.-It was also decided in these diagnostic tests of grammatical errors to present no wrong forms. Though no definite conclusions are reached in another section of this study as to the effect of their presence in a test, it seems rea- sonably clear that such grammatically wrong forms are often con- fusing and harmful when presented in the early stages of the at- tempt to teach the right ones. And since these tests are intended as both diagnostic and teaching devices, such forms were at tre- mendous expenditure of time and effort avoided. To devise a genuinely measuring test in which only blanks ap- pear to be filled in by the pupil is a task of almost endless difficulty. In the first place, when all forms not prescribed by the answer- sheet are marked wrong, the results are practically valueless. It is possible to substitute equivocal variants in most sentences of every completion test of the sort. For example, in "This dog will fight, but - kind in that kennel won't," "the" is perfectly permissi- ble, but it is scored wrong in like sentences in most completion tests. It is necessary, then, (i) to guard against the possibility of such variants so far as possible, (2) to find out precisely their nature and extent in every sentence, and (3) to score right all which can have a reasonable defense. Only in the degree that they are so few as not noticeably to affect the score is the test a valid measure of the occurrence of the wrong form. Hence the correction sheets listed both the specific right and wrong forms expected for each sentence, and also provided place both for the number of variants on each and for a list of all such forms and their frequencies. The huge difficulty of getting sen- tences in which only the right or the wrong form will naturally be written is illustrated by Sentence 7 of Test A: 7. These apples taste sour, but I like - kind in the other barrel very much. (Only words with four or more letters will be counted right in sentence 7.)</page><page sequence="8">THE WISCONSIN TESTS 437 The directions, with the best that could be done, are still more complicated than is desirable, and probably render the test too difficult for grades below the seventh. The immense labor of listing all these variant forms, cheerfully volunteered by a great many grade-school and high-school teachers, is gratefully acknowledged. They proved of considerable interest to many of the participating teachers, and their total of information concerning children's diffi- culties with English is considerable. They will be printed in full in the complete account of these studies next fall. Wherever for lack of adequate research funds it is necessary, as in this study, to have the scoring of papers done by persons not specifically trained for the particular work, it is clear that a con- siderable element of error must enter. This is by custom simply written off as chance error and assumed to cancel. There is reason to believe that this element was not increased by the suggestion that sentence scores be made up in class by discussion and scoring of the right and wrong forms and of variants, since the tests were either checked afterward or sent to the central office for scoring. And in any case so much was gained for the revision of the tests and also for the teaching of the right and allowable forms that the practice is recommended for use in the standardizing of later tests of this kind. Various types of difficulties revealed by the tests.-The tables of variants' provide a considerable mass of information on diffi- culties other than formal correctness in grammar. Many of these are concerned directly with reading ability. It was noted that some pupils apparently fill in a form suggested by the word next to the blank, but with no relation to the remainder of the sentence, as when in the sentence "I have finished my work and - home" the words "chores" and "mother" were used, apparently based on the association of the word "home." No doubt these errors corre- spond with very low mental age, and indicate clearly inability to cope with reading matter of average difficulty even for junior high schools. Reading and punctuation.-A curious variant, which it was for a long time difficult to account for, occurred with the sentence "Don't - it get out." Such apparently irrelevant words as 3 Recorded in full in the account of this study, to be published later.</page><page sequence="9">438 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL "touch," "bother," "tease," were repeatedly used. They were final- ly accounted for as showing that many pupils apparently read the first three words as a separate sentence from the last two, utterly disregarding the absence of separative punctuation and not trou- bling even to supply any. It is clear that until punctuation-par- ticularly the separation of sentences-is so taught as to have meaning in pupils' reading, it will never find place or value in their own written work. This suggests in our teaching of both reading and composition, a greater emphasis on the genuine social function of essential forms. The distribution of scores by grades in each of the tests of grammatical correctness is given in Table II. A table of all the scores on each sentence will appear in the completed study. Taken together, these show in detail, first, the precise number and per- centage of the conventional error for which we were looking in each sentence; and second, the percentage of cases in which we failed to get either this wrong form or the corresponding right one, be- cause pupils did not fill the blank at all, or disregarded general instructions or the specific directions on a few of the sentences, or used some other wrong form altogether or another right form against which we had not guarded. All such variant forms are in- structive in one way or another. The extent to which the tests measure.-The percentages of failure to fill blanks and of evasion of the right or the wrong form show precisely to what extent the test sentences are measures of what they set out to investigate. Any conclusions on a completion test of this sort which do not take full note of the exact nature and extent of such leakage are practically valueless. By means of the revision on the basis of trials of the tests, the totals of responses, by sentences, of all cases in which neither the right form nor the expected wrong form was filled in, to the fol- lowing averages for each test: TEST A TEST B (Per Cent (Per Cent) Blanks unfilled or instructions not followed correctly . o.69 0.63 Allowable variant forms . . . . . . . 0.79 0.47 Other errors, mistakes in reading, etc. .0.99 1.40 Total variance . . ....... 2.47 2.50</page><page sequence="10">THE WISCONSIN TESTS 439 It should be noted that the other errors were often of value in re- vealing grammatical and other difficulties of pupils. Wherever the total of variance exceeded 3 per cent, the test sentences were re- constructed to reduce this, except in a few cases, especially noted, TABLE II CONDENSED DISTRIBUTION OF SCOiES FOR VARIOUS PERCENTAGES OF PUPILS IN GRADES VII-XIII ON THE TESTS OF GRAMMATICAL CORRECTNESS, BY SENTENCES RIGHT* Test A Grade Pupils go% 75% 50% 25% Io% VII ......... 371 17-9 16. 5 14.2 13.0 Io.8 VIII........ 416 18.5 17.2 15.6 13.3 11.2 IX.......... 779 19.8 18.4 16.4 14-3 12.I X........... 568 20. 19.3 17.7 15.8 14.2 XI.......... 448 20.

It is probable that the tests are not only approximately fair in measuring the position of any given pupil in the class', but that the revised forms are also sufficiently close in central tendency and distribution to be used as measures of progress before and after a period of teaching. As with the sentence recognition tests, a third parallel form has been devised and is in process of being standardized. Conclusions from the grammatical correctness tests.-The most immediately useful contribution of such tests, as of those on sentence recognition, is the probable frequency of the specific errors they consider. The order of errors according to their per- centage scores for more than 5,000 pupils in grades VII through XII is shown in Table III. It will be seen that (i) "hair are" or "were," with 32.I per cent of error, (2) "them" or "those kind" with 26.6 per cent, and (3) "wish you would have" with 25.3 per cent, stand at the top of the list, with percentages of error in excess of 25 for weighted averages of grades VII and XII. These are fol- lowed by "told" or "invited" . . . . I (24.7 per cent), "like" for "as if," (24.1 per cent), "it's" or "its'" for the possessive (23.1 per cent) all exceeding 20 per cent error. On the other hand, "seen" for "saw," 1.3 per cent, "can I?" 1.5 per cent, and "learn us," 2.1 per cent appear at the bottom of the list with weighted averages near or below 2 per cent. In grades VII to XII "can" for "may" never appeared above 4.4 per cent (Grade VIII), and had only three scores of 2 per cent or over; "learn us" had not above 4.4 per cent (Grade VIII); "seen" not above 2.7 per cent (Grade VIII). These three have therefore been omitted from the revised tests for high-school use; they can evidently be mastered before grade VII, and in properly organized courses be simply required beyond that place, but not constitute problems for high-school attack." But forms such as "hair are," which runs from 71.7 per cent error in grade VIII to 14.3 per cent ' Full correlations and T-Scores by sentences are in process of construction for both tests. SMany times in statements, either "can" or "may" is apparently equally cor- rect. These figures are only for the question "May I do so-and-so ?"</page><page sequence="13">442 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL in grade XIII-first-year normal school-should receive more at- tention than in the past. Using these rankings as a basis, any school can proceed to make out its own individual inventory of difficulties, as was done, for example, in the Racine Survey, and lay its plan of campaign accordingly. This is on the apparently valid assumption that all the errors listed are gross enough to war- rant attention, and on the tenable but unproved assumption that frequency of an error in a test like this corresponds at least roughly with its frequency in speech and in writing. The high percentages of error show our failure, in preoccupation with numerous less flagrant difficulties and often with quite justifiable idioms, to root out the worst violations of grammatical correctness. Use of the tests of diagnostic measurement.-Through the courteous co-operation of Dr. W. J. Osburn, of the Wisconsin State Department of Education, it was arranged to give one of the tests of sentence recognition and one of grammatical correctness with a group of other measures in the County Training Schools and in the rural-school departments of two normal schools in Wisconsin. The students who took these tests were at the end of their one-year period of preparation and being sent out as fully qualified to teach in rural schools. They actually fell below the average of eighth- grade pupils on these and other tests in English taken in the same series, in from 5 per cent of cases, in writing compositions graded by the Nassau County Scale, to i i per cent in the grammatical cor- rectness test and 37 per cent in the sentence recognition test which at least measures fairly well their ability to proofread pupils' sen- tences. This is sufficient commentary on the status of teaching in the country schools. The work calls for much better qualified teachers; and unless higher standards are set and enforced we shall have no hope of achieving decent literacy in rural education. Only standardized and, therefore, comparable measures like these tests could show this situation so graphically. Both tests were also used, with other means of measurement, in making the survey of English in the Racine public schools. NOTE.-Professor Leonard has donated the Wisconsin tests to the National Council. They are available at go cents a hundred.</page></plain_text>
