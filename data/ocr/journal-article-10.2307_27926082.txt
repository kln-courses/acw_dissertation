<plain_text><page sequence="1">Agn?s Spycket: La statuaire du Proche-Orient ancien (Handbuch der Orientalistik. Siebente Abteilung. Kunst und Arch?ologie), Leiden, 1981. xxvii + 474 pages, 88 figures, 284 plates. Clothbound. More than thirty years have passed since the pub lication (1954) of the first issue of Henri Frank fort's book, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient. Revised in 1977, it was until recently the most comprehensive work on the monumental and minor arts of Mesopotamia, Persia, Asia Minor, Syria and the Levant, cover ing the period from the emergence of Sumerian civilization to the collapse of the Achaemenid empire. Agn?s Spycket's study covers the same geographical area and also ends with the Macedo nian conquest (330 B.C.E.), but new discoveries enable her to go back far beyond the Protohistoric period (second half of the fourth millennium B.C.E.) and to begin her book on ancient Near Eastern sculpture with the prehistoric era (eighth millennium .CE.). Unlike Frankfort, however, she confines her exhaustive study to three dimensional statuary, excluding reliefs and glyptic art. The introduction (pp. 1-2) discusses the prob lem of classification of the artefacts of different function and quality that fit the definition of three dimensional statuary. Taking into account geo graphical and chronological criteria, Spycket wonders whether there is any common denomina tor between crudely shaped figurines from sixth millennium ?atal H?y?k and the royal statue of Gudea, dating from about 2150 B.C.E., or between a second millennium bronze warrior from Syria and a Urartian ivory statue from the first millenium B.C.E. She is well aware of the fact that the technique needed for cutting and modelling a large block of stone is completely different from that needed for carving an elephant's tusk, but is unwilling to reduce the scope of her study by excluding small statuary and treating only mon - umental sculpture, since she believes that size is not a proper criterion for assigning artefacts to different art categories. Because of the large variety of forms and the diversity of material and techniques, Spycket makes her classification as simple as possible, and chooses the subject of representation as the basic typological criterion. The statues are assigned to two main categories: anthropomorphic and zoo morphic. Among those of the first category, which form the bulk of her material, a distinction is made (when possible) between statues depicting gods, kings and worshippers of both sexes. In each cate gory there are subgroupings based on material, posture and other attributes. The vast geographical and chronological scope of the book poses many historical and cultural problems. Spycket prefers to apply geographical rather than ethnic criteria in discussing the stylistic affinities of Near Eastern statuary. She is realistic enough to admit that our current knowledge, par ticularly about the Levant, does not yet allow us to ascribe specific styles to specific groups of people, even in those cases when the date and origin of artefacts are well established. Recent discoveries in Syria, particularly at Ebla, have disproved Frankfort's opinion that Asia Minor, the Levant, Syria and Persia should be regarded as peripheral regions in relation to</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 287 Mesopotamia. By presenting statues from differ ent geographical regions in their proper chrono logical sequence, Spycket often allows the reader to judge for himself whether there are conceptual or functional relationships between stone, metal, and ivory statues found in one region and contem porary statues found in another. The first chapter deals with the prehistoric era (about 8000-3200 B.C.E.), whose sequence is still not complete. One of the interesting phen omena noted by Spycket is that the most ancient anthropomorphic representations yet discovered appear in Palestine and Syria (eighth-seventh mil lennia). The famous plastered skulls and clay statues from Pre-Pottery Neolithic Jericho have their counterparts at Beisamoun in the Upper Galilee and Tell Ramad in Syria (p. 6), as well as in the recent finds from 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan. Spycket's claim that the earliest attempts at work ing in hard stones (such as marble, alabaster and obsidian) are attested at ?atal H?y?k and Hacilar sheds an important light on the authenticity of early Anatolian art. However, it seems unlikely that the affinities of the ivory statuettes from the Chalcolithic sites near Beer-Sheba to those of the Badarian civilization of Middle Egypt can be questioned by bringing remote parallels from Tepe Yahya in Iran (p. 24). The Protohistoric era, discussed in Chapter II, is a short period (about 3200-2900 B.C.E.) that has provided a great variety of statuary. Since the canonic style that prevailed in Mesopotamia dur ing the Early Dynastic period (Chapter III) had already crystallized in the Protoliterate period, systematic study of the materials and techniques used in the latter period are of utmost importance. In this respect it is useful to refer to three limestone male figures of unknown origin, now in the Lou vre (PL 20:a-b), whose arms are folded in the distinctive attitude of adoration that became characteristic of the statuary of the following period. The repertory of statues in alabaster is exemplified by an offering bearer from Susa (Fig. 11) and a female head from Tell Brak (PL 28). Masterpieces from Warka, such as the marble female head (PL 27) and the crouching feline in copper whose body is inlaid with lapis lazuli (Fig. 14) attest to the most prominent innovations of this period. The leading role played by cult and royal statues in the temples of the early urban centres of Meso potamia, and the distinctive effects created by the conceptual and technical conventions developed by the Sumerian and Akkadian sculptors of the third millennium B.C.E., are thoroughly des cribed in Chapters III and IV. One of the main contributions of Spycket's study is in demonstrat ing the variability of sculptural styles that had emerged in Anatolia, the Syrian hinterland and the Syro-Palestine littoral at the close of the third millennium and the early second millennium B.C.E. (Chapters V-VI). The sculptural heritage of Anatolia is best attested by the flat alabaster idols of K?ltepe, dated to the end of the third millennium (p. 218) and the distinctive features that characterize lead and ivory statues of the early second millennium B.C.E. recently discovered at Kara-H?y?k and Acemh?y?k (pp. 258-259). Special emphasis is given to stone and metal workshops, which seem to have been established in most of the major urban centres in North Syria (Ebla, Alalakh and Ugarit) and along the coast of the Levant (espe cially Byblos), in the first half of the second mil lennium B.C.E. The influence of Mesopotamian models on stone sculptures from inner Syria has long been known, yet the impact of the Mari school on several stone statues found lately at Ebla is of special interest (pp. 261-263). Spycket is right in her claim that, unlike the huge assemblages of Egyptianized metal statuettes that were produced at Byblos, those made at Ugarit and in several metal workshops in the Orontes Valley and the Lebanon mountains bear regional features of dis tinctive local origin (pp. 267-286). The complexity of Near Eastern artistic trends in the second half of the second millennium B.C.E. apparently reflects the new political situation that prevailed in Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Egypt and the Levant at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age (Chapter VII). Spycket assumes that with the eclipse of the First Dynasty of Babylon, the floruit of Mesopotamian sculpture came to an end. The rise of the Kassite dynasty opened a 'Dark Age', which is reflected by the mediocrity of its art (p. 295). According to the author's view, there are no Mitannian, Syrian, or Egyptian influences on imperial Hittite sculpture, the distinctive charac ter of which is attested both by the monumental stone statues and the small metal statuettes (pp.</page><page sequence="3">288 REVIEWS 318-326). Spycket's most difficult task, however, has been to analyse the syncretistic nature of Levantine statuary of this period. She does this admirably and re-evaluates conventional general izations about the impact of Hittite and Egyptian art on the stonework, metalwork and ivory craftsmanship of their provinces in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Her systematic analysis of the statuary found in various excavations in this region contributes to a better understanding of the? context and nature of many artefacts, such as the stone statues of Hazor (pp. 330-331) and the ivo ries of Kamid el-Loz and Megiddo (pp. 335-336). The cautious manner in which Spycket has handled the large quantity of metal statuettes from the Levant has far-reaching chronological and artistic implications. In re-examining the context and style of metal statues that can safely be assigned to the second half of the second millen nium B.C.E. (pp. 336-353), she correctly assumes that their production 'reste dans la tradition du d?but du IIe mill?naire, avec cependant des inno vations que Ton peut d?celer; l'influence pharo nique y est fortement marqu?e, mais avec une grande libert? d'expression'(p. 318). By excluding debased specimens of unknown origin and unreli able context from the repertory of the Late Bronze Age, she has been able to shed new light on the enigmatic lack of Phoenician bronzes of the Iron Age (pp. 326-430), discussed in the last chapter of the book. Her important contribution to this problem has lately been emphasized by Dr. R. Moorey who writes: 'Until Spycket's recent treat ment...no systematic survey had been made of those contexted bronze statuettes from Syro Palestine that might be associated with Phoeni cian craftsmen of the first half of the first millen nium B.C....although the great majority of uncontexted Syro-Palestinian small metal statues are of the Bronze Age, there is a significant minor ity for which an Iron Age date may be argued.'1 The huge number of artefacts discussed in Spycket's exhaustive work, the objective manner in which every piece available to her is analysed, the neatly drawn illustrations in the text, the exceptional number of photographs (284) and the detailed index make this book a masterpiece. The excellent layout of the book and the quality of its printing should also be singled out for praise. Ora Negbi 1 P.R. Moorey and S.
