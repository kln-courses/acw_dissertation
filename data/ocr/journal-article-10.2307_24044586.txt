The idea of the sacred marriage derives reinterpretation of Milton's Paradise Lost. Coleridge, for ex from the Book of Revelation; Revelation in turn draws on ample, comes close to saying that the real story of Paradise the Tanach (Old Testament) prophetic tradition which Lost is that of John Milton: "observe, how the second and speaks of God's covenant with Israel in terms appropriate third book [of Paradise Lost] support the subjective charac to the marriage-covenant, and, conversely, of the sins of ter of the poem. ...

The poet calls upon two different ways of relating the mind to nature—two contradictory ways, I would suggest. This is the conflict between what might broadly be characterized as a neoclassical trope, the appeal for poetic inspiration to a power above and around the self, and a Christian desire to "save" fallen nature by treating it as tex tual, as a book, in which the individual may "read." Both models of the mind-nature relationship assume the separa tion of man from nature, the second more obviously than , , . , ... , r _ .._ , . , ing, to look at the piece of glass.

For months, the man returns regularly to the ruined dwell ting. The neoclassical technique for overcoming the mind nature gap, most clearly seen in the famous apostrophe to Urania, aspires towards a form of anamnesis. It hopes to recover a lost union, to restore the lost source and origin of human powers, by forgetting the historical isolation or sol ipsism of the poet's present self. The nature-as-text anal ogy, on the other hand, preserves the contingency and isolation of the present self, permitting it to take the stance of acolyte and interpreter towards the book of nature. But in order to do this it must forget or repress the natural ori gins of the self, all those powers which according to The Prel ude "fashion" and "build up" the mind, and all that "spirit of the past" which the poet of the Prelude strives to recover "for future restoration." kind of desperate solipsism—not for his own sake alone, but as a surrogate for others—seems part of Wordsworth's purpose in "Home at Grasmere," and in The Recluse itself. It involves discovering how to cultivate "beauteous forms," instead of fragments that merely reflect one's own transient fragmentariness. Wordsworth had worked on this problem in the 1798-1799 Prelude: he had faced it even before them, in the spring of 1798, drafting some lines for the consola tory reflections on Margaret's story in The Ruined Cottage. The sort of communion that a solitary has with objects of nature—"These quiet sympathies with things that hold / An inarticulate language"—may have a healthful effect, the passage suggests, softening and diverting into a more crea tive channel the potential violence of the feelings: "Ac cordingly he by degrees perceives / His feelings of aversion softened down / A holy tenderness pervade his frame / His This competition between two different poetic episte- sanity of reason not impaired . . . 1 But the integrity of mologies is a more serious matter than a mere failure to the self, "sanity of reason," has to be preserved where the contextualize the poem, or to choose between two styles of "quiet sympathies" threaten to turn into something more poetic imagery. It reaches to the main issue the poem debilitating, raises—what kind of role and what special way of knowing the poet lays claim to. It threatens to destroy the poet's In "Home at Grasmere" Wordsworth returns to this attempt to construct a secure and stable self, an attempt struggle to balance svmpaihy with the selfs integrity. One which culminates in the grand resolution of the marriage good illustration of the way Wordsworth tried to control metaphor. The marriage metaphor, finally so prominent in the notion of solitude and keep it from slipping into pure the Prospectus,7 and apparently a triumphant denial of sol- solipsism is the removal of the story of the adulterer (lines ipsism, heralding the union of the "Mind of Man" with its 469-532 of MS B).

In this respect the "solitude" the poet en Wordsworth's attempted rapprochement between the joys turns out to be the solitariness of literary convention human and the natural, by the explicit humanizing of na- rather than an existential solitariness. He is not Beattie's ture as well as by the naturalizing of the poetic voice, Minstrel, standing sublime amid uncharted mountains and reveals the contradictions in the older classical mythology forests, but a reader of a text, in fact of a palimpsest bear and in the eighteenth-century version of it. In "Home at ing many layers of human overwriting.24 Grasmere," the tradition of the world-soul confronts the conception of the world as text, as an alternative book of This clearly puts "Nature's invitation" in a different revelation, supplementary to the revealed Word of the Bi- light. It also might explain the change from MS B's "One ble: Nature made available only through culture. The first Life" to MS D's "Law supreme," in the following passage: raises questions of communion and of inspiration -, the second, questions of interpretation, of hermeneutics. In the first, it is Of joy in widest commonalty spread, the present selfs inadequacy and distance from the source Of the individual mind that keeps its own that are forgotten; in the second, the commonalty of origin.

Nature, it is implied, is a quiet- habituated to imagining nature as already textual—seeing ing, taming, civilizing presence, rather than an inspiring, nature as écriture. It will not do to dismiss this change as empowering, invigorating one; its ministry is the ministry bad poetry or as a mere concession to Christian orthodoxy, of fear. But what is at work here, it is important to realize, because such a dismissal camouflages an even more is nature interpreted and the very act of seeing nature as profound change than that from a somewhat unorthodox textual and as amenable to interpretation is part of that theology to a more orthodox one. What happens here is a process of civilizing, accommodating, harnessing ourselves recognition of the cognitive problem ignored or postponed to community instead of self, to an ideology instead of to by the neoclassical trope of inspiration we have noted in instinct. The Wanderer's (in the early version, Pedlar's) other parts of "Home at Grasmere." As Blake realized, and ability to see nature as textual marks him out as already Rousseau didn't, we cannot know or deal with "nature" ex subdued to human purposes, and the explicit connection cept through the human: through myth or some other with Christian discipline only highlights the extent to which form of pre-understanding, a structure of laws, signifi this process had already happened: cances, "history." (The same perception can be found in 115</page><page sequence="8">Thoreau, for whom the experience of a completely unmiti gated wilderness, in "Ktaadn," is shattering.) In this context, too, the humanizing of the prophetic soul of the wide world appears as a "natural" extension of the rhetoric of earlier passages that project the human com munity of the Vale, its "peopled solitude" (the phrase is from the Alfoxden Notebook, WPW 5:341), on to the Vale itself, describing the Vale as happy in itself, as smiling, and so on; and it is a most necessary move if there is to be com munication between them. The nature that invites must already be one with, or at least informed by, the reason that sanctions the invitation. The Vale of Grasmere is not after all to be identified with untouched, undespoiled nature: it has been from time im memorial mastered, tilled, owned-. so here abides A power and a protection for the mind, Dispensed indeed to other Solitudes Favored by noble privilege like this, Where kindred independence of estate Is prevalent where he who tills the field, He, happy Man! is Master of the field And treads the mountains which his Fathers trod. (MS D, 11. 376-383) The trope of reading nature's text, and the associated idea of nature as embodying law, appear to have forced Words worth into bringing into greater prominence what could be called the "Michael" theme, the idea that spiritual strength and moral virtues such as fortitude and perseverance stem from, not "nature" per se, but nature interpreted, charted, and owned over several generations, the patrimonial fields. The invocation to nature is therefore a call to the absent origin, the origin it has been essential to forget in order to "know" what is "known" of nature's laws. Wordsworth's hesitation between two tropes and two traditions—the classical trope of invoking the "voice of life" itself, and the eighteenth-century Christian humanist trope of an appeal to the appearances of nature as to a text—is not, I think, a mere failure of poetic nerve, or a symptom of the onset of religious orthodoxy. It precisely dramatizes the situation confronting the modern poet. Knowledge can be grounded on past desires, fears, appe tencies, memory, imaginings: this knowledge has the strength of harmonizing suitably with the chosen pastoral mode of utterance, seeming to be the very voice of Nature itself, but risks naivety, solipsism, the inability to encom pass meaningful choice, human tragedy, contradiction, or irony. Or knowledge can be grounded on the developed, moral being, able to read the "law supreme" inscribed in Nature. This necessitates the distancing of the self from past desires and the willingness to be "rational and suffering," perhaps even suffering the fate that Nietzsche suggests will overtake those who are burdened by a sense of history—an inability to act at all. In The Prelude, the relation between the two is developmental: the second develops out of the first. Here, in "Home at Grasmere," the cost of exchanging the first for the second cannot any longer be ignored. "Home at Grasmere" is meant to confirm and announce the person, the self, that the speaker has become. The prob lem is how to do this without introducing a crippling dis harmony into that self—without, that is, repudiating the very origins of that selfhood's power. The marriage metaphor, the climactic trope of "Home at Grasmere, attempts to resolve this apparently in soluble problem, to heal the division of mind from itself which we have traced in Wordsworth's narrative. Having to choose between the self-abnegation of speaking for Nature, being Nature's ventriloquist, and the closed, sterile destiny of reading in Nature only what humankind has already "writ ten" there, Wordsworth selects a third way which is unrec ognized by both, the visionary transformation of the world through the wedding of the human mind to Nature.25 "Mar riage" with Nature is impossible, taboo—as marriage with Dorothy would have been—yet it is the only way to reaffirm commonalty of origin while preserving (on the biblical model) different roles for the two partners. "Marriage re quires that Husband and Wife be of the same Nature," wrote William Sherlock (one of Coleridge's favourite divines), referring to Christ's marriage to His church.26 Af filiation to nature would be tantamount to self-abnegation, and to proclaim an absolute human superiority to nature, and ability to read it, would be merely to exchange one form of solipsism for another. Hence, both the "discerning intellect of Man" and the "goodly universe" which is to be its spouse must be equally reaffirmed, even though the two partners are not exactly to be equal. We have only to re member the prophetic tradition of describing God's cove nant with Israel as a marriage to see that there cannot be equality in such a match, so understood. Yet if Nature is to be transformed, the mind is also to be healed by the union, which surely means that the new consciousness is not to be achieved at the cost of forgetting. The future Elysium will be "the simple produce of the common day," implying that the poet does not have to drink Lethe to get there, but rather simply to remember who and what he is. This con sciousness is undeniably a tragic consciousness, as the lines referring to the "solitary anguish" of humanity make clear; and the question that is left unresolved, in both "Home at Grasmere" and The Recluse itself, is whether any form of Elysium can be reconciled with such knowledge.

The fact that the poem exists in more than one "version" merely emphasizes the extent to which discussion of poetic self opens up questions of the interdependency of self and text. I am indebted to Thomas Pfau's suggestion that self (in a poem) is best approached as itself a kind of figure: see "Rhetoric and the Exis tential: Romantic Studies and the Question of the Subject," SIR, 26 (1987):487-512, especially 508-509. '"Finally" because, in the earliest surviving MS of the "Pro spectus," conveniently printed by Jonathan Wordsworth as an Ap pendix to The Borders of Vision (1982), pp. 387-390, the marriage metaphor is given only ten words (11. 39-40), which grow to twelve lines in 1805/1806 (MS B); but it is there. 8From this point, with exceptions to be noted, I refer to Home at Grasmere: Part First, Book First, of The Recluse, ed Beth Darlington (1977). Most references are to Darlington's parallel reading texts of MSS B and D (pp. 38-107), and are by line numbers.

Magnuson is right to link the river with inspiration, but I think he is "forgetting" the other river of classical mythology—Lethe—and this leads him to too narrow an interpre tation of the passage. The fact that it immediately follows the mys terious disappearance of the swans is not mere happenstance, as Magnuson seems to think. 17Thoughts Out of Season, Part II, Complete Works, ed.
