We may safely assume, in the absence of positive informa- tion, that when any sentiment or feeling, whether of a transient or permanent character, moves either transiently or perma- nently large masses of men, it is grounded on some innate disposition of human nature. It is either a response to a long- felt want, to employ a much-abused phrase, or the exciting cause awakens emotions that have long lain dormant for lack of such a cause. There are psychological forces in all men that remain quiescent at times and in some men all the time except under extraordinary stimuli, but which when aroused set in motion waves of feeling that are almost co- extensive with the human race. Researches into anthropo- logical and ethnological psychology are making it more and more clear every day that even in the most civilized communi- ties very few men are governed in all or in fact in any considerable proportion of their actions by their reasoning faculties, and that as you go downward in the scale, to use the common mode of speech, you find a constantly increasing num- ber who are swayed by all sorts of irrational impulses. In other words, one finds in the most enlightened society lower strata whose modes of thought, so far as they think at all, are on the same level with savages. This might be demonstrated in a week, or even in a day, if any given community could be turned upside down socially and those put into power who are at present of no account whatever in the body politic, because the process of evolution has never carried them beyond the point where their entire intellectual energy is consumed in the effort to obtain what they shall eat and what they shall drink and wherewithal they shall be clothed. Though most men are swayed by irrational motives, that is by motives they have never analyzed and can give no reason for, it does not follow that there is no philosophical basis for their existence. Patriot- ism, for example, is intrinsically an irrational motive, yet without it government would be wholly out of the question; and experience abundantly proves that the worst sort of gov- ernment is better than none. Mankind has made progress only</page><page sequence="2">Vicarious Sacrifice. 445 where some kind of control over the individual by the body politic has been established. Yet men never become patriotic after reflecting upon the benefits of a fervent national feeling; it is only when they are moved by this sentiment that they frequently seek by processes of reasoning to demonstrate the benefits and the glory of patri- otism. Many men are influenced by moral motives who have never given moral problems a single thought. Not only is this true of the present time, but it has always been so. The Hebrews had reached a certain moral elevation before such a code as the Decalogue could find acceptance among them. Some of them at least practiced its precepts before anybody thought of putting them in writing. This much is confirmed by analogy, for at what period of their history this code was first promulgated and made the basis of their legislation is uncertain. Among all peoples that have attained a certain plane of progress a high value is placed upon human life. Neverthe- less a still higher value is set upon unswerving devotion to a principle or a set of principles. If Socrates had not placed the seal upon his doctrines by his death for them, there is no doubt that his disciples would have transmitted them to posterity just the same. But the master would occupy a very different place in the eyes of posterity from that which he now occupies. Perhaps one person in a thousand is to some extent interested in the philosopher and his system where nine hundred and ninety-nine read the story of his trial and death with mingled feelings of pity and admiration and indignation-pity for the man because of the injustice done him; admiration of his calm- ness and courage in his last hours; and indignation at his accusers and unjust judges. The most convincing evidence that a man can give of his faith in his doctrines or of a cause he champions is his willingness to sacrifice his life for them. Rome had her heroes and heroines like Cocles and Cloelia and Regulus who threw their lives into the scale for their country; but no Roman ever felt a call to sacrifice himself for anybody outside of the circle of his fellow-citizens, least of all for a universal principle. Seneca probably came nearest to</page><page sequence="3">446 International Journal of Ethics. doing so; and while we may admire him and sympathize with him in the extraordinarily trying position in which he was placed in his later years, we cannot help but feel that, compared with a man like Socrates, he cuts but a sorry figure. Do what you believe to be right and consider everything else of sub- ordinate importance, was the rule of life followed by Socrates, Do as nearly right as you can under the circumstances in which you are placed; in any event give the circumstances due con- sideration, was the motto of Seneca. His country so com- pletely bounded the moral vision of the Roman, even of the noblest among them, that he could scarcely conceive of genuine worth beyond its pale. The Greeks saw farther. Antigone was one of their most cherished national heroines because she chose to obey God rather than man, though at the sacrifice of her life. Alkestis was moved by a somewhat different sentiment, but there was in it more of the allgemein Menschliche, more of genuine altruism than is displayed by any Roman hero or heroine. To the highest height Socrates alone attained. That the Athenians deemed no one worthy to reign after Kodrus is, of course, mythical in the form in which the story has been transmitted to us; and it partakes more of the Roman than the Greek; that is, it represents the national feeling at a stage beyond which the Roman never passed. Still such traditions are interesting landmarks along the road which the most advanced nations have traveled and the value they placed popularly upon self- sacrifice. There is no doubt that Christ felt himself divinely called to the mission he ended on the cross; yet there is equally little doubt that St. Paul gave it a currency which it might not at all, or at least not so rapidly, have gained but for his zeal. When after the breaking-up of the Roman empire the clergy gradually deepened the main channel of their theological system and turned into it all thought that rose above the mere routine of daily life, it was inevitable that the only meritorious sacrifice that men could make would be in behalf of religion, whether by a life of renunciation or by the renunciation of life. Fidelity to a universal empire was now diverted into fidelity to a universal</page><page sequence="4">Vicarious Sacrifice. 447 church. Necessarily the martyr became the highest type of the Christian and even of man, the one who most nearly approached the divine prototype. No doubt many became martyrs from motives that could hardly be called meritorious. They pre- ferred to leave this world as ostentatiously as possible. It was in the life, and especially in the death, of the martyrs that the medieval church found its most nutritious spiritual pabulum. One of the most widely current, perhaps the most widely cur- rent, of all medieval legends is the story of Prince Henry and Elsie, as told in verse by the poet Longfellow. Speaking of it he says: "It seems to me to surpass all other legends in beauty and significance. It exhibits, amid the corruption of the Middle Ages, the virtues of disinterestedness and self- sacrifice." Much of this sacrifice was misdirected, probably most of it was, because it was selfish rather than altruistic; but it fell in with a state of feeling that was far deeper and wider than the church. Moreover, it is often easier to die for a cause or a principle than to live for it, especially when death comes to the victim under spectacular conditions, while the alternative life of service and sacrifice is as the light hid under a bushel. "The Golden Legend" took such a hold upon the masses because the chief actor in it was peculiarly fitted to excite their sympathy. Young, beautiful, devout, with the promise of a long career of useful service before her, she, like Christ her prototype, foregoes all and offers her life a voluntary sacrifice for her sovereign. It affected the common people the more deeply by bringing home to them the reflection that one of their number was accounted worthy to accomplish so great a deliverance. In medieval times the necessity of sacrifice for any other object or even of sincere devotion to any other cause than the church could hardly arise. Alfred the Great was probably the only sovereign that Europe produced in half a dozen centuries whose patriotism had nothing spectacular in it, and but the smallest modicum of selfishness. For, important as was the work of Charlemagne in advancing civilization, he showed quite as much eagerness to add new domains to his realm as VOl. XV-No. 4. 30</page><page sequence="5">448 International Journal of Ethics. to win converts to the Christian faith or to civilize what he already possessed. It is easy to vilipend or ridicule the principle involved in vicarious sacrifice. The late Colonel Ingersoll never lost an opportunity to sneer at the doctrine of the atonement because it implied the punishment of the wrong man. He declared it to "be the enemy of morality" since "it teaches that the innocent can justly suffer for the guilty." It is certain that they often do so suffer. They are doing it every day; if they did not society could not exist for a day. Much, however, depends on the meaning you give to "suf- fer"; for if the voluntary performance of a disagreeable duty entails suffering then the good suffer more than the bad, much more. Still it ought to be said that Ingersoll's hostility to the doctrine of the atonement was directed against its theological interpretation in that it permitted the man who had led a long and vicious life to enter upon the joys of paradise on exactly the same terms and conditions with him who had spent his days in doing good. Vicarious sacrifice in a temporal sense does punish the wrong man, if one man is just as good naturally as another and just as capable of meeting his responsibilities. But he is not. Two persons may look exactly alike physically yet be widely different. If all the effort of one man for forty or fifty years is expended in making a bare living and another with no greater effort amasses a fortune in the same time, is there any injustice involved if the community requires the latter to contribute to the maintenance of the former, if he comes to want? Often a small part of one man's intellectual energy is sufficient to keep him in comfort while the entire output of another will not do the same for him. All govern- ments compel the rich man to contribute more for his protection than the poor man because such protection means more to him, seeing he has more to protect. The men and women who devote a part or the whole of their time and means and labor to bettering the condition of the morally degraded are plainly making a voluntary vicarious sacrifice of themselves for the redemption of others. Many a man cannot save himself morally who can do so by the help of another.</page><page sequence="6">Vicarious Sacrifice. 449 When the chief priests and rabbis mockingly said of Christ that he saved others they uttered a great truth, if the rest of the sneer that he could not save himself did not necessarily follow. Yet it is true of many persons who are endowed with strong moral feelings that they cannot, in a sociological sense, save others and themselves likewise; if they would save others, they dare not, before the forum of conscience they cannot, save themselves. The mocking Jews understood by save life only: in this sense Socrates or St. Paul and many others could no more save themselves than could Christ. Where the instinct or, at its highest, the half-conscious feel- ing of the solidarity of the citizens composing a state, is the strongest, there the moral conditions are the best. When a state demands military service it selects the strong to bear the burdens of the weak; it demands of the former a vicarious sacrifice. He who pays taxes makes of himself, in a sense, a more or less voluntary vicarious victim for those who cannot do likewise. He does the same thing in a still higher sense who performs voluntary service for the amelioration of the condition of the "submerged tenth." Usually he does not stop to calculate the exact amount of personal benefit he shall receive from such service: he simply obeys a conviction or a call to duty, a duty which, in the growth of the feeling of the solidarity of society or even of the human race, is being felt by a constantly increasing number of persons. To this extent he is Christlike, the more so when this voluntary obedience to the call of duty entails the loss of health or even of life. The doctrine of supererogation as taught by the Romish church grew up out of the same instinct and typifies the same widespread conviction. It has shifted into the domain of theology, where it is probably of comparatively little value to any one, a principle of the utmost importance in the realm of sociology. The philanthropist and altruist saves his fellow- men in this life by doing more than is necessary for his own temporal salvation, provided his efforts are wisely directed to a rational end. Gaius on Justinian says: "Justice is the continual desire of always rendering to each one that which is his due." Here</page><page sequence="7">450 International Journal of Ethics. it is to be noted that justice is the desire not the act. Aristotle has much to say on the same subject, and it engaged the atten- tion of thinkers before the time of Hammurabi. Theoretically it is clear enough that in the affairs of life every one ought to have his due. But how shall this be determined and who shall apportion it? Organized society is such a complex entity and the machinery of justice such a clumsy device it can take little account of capacity or motive, and we may be sure that this same problem will attract the attention and exercise the in- genuity of men some thousands of years hence. Meanwhile one class will always get more than they deserve and another class less than they are justly entitled to before the forum of abstract right. Vicarious voluntary service and sacrifice will be increasingly in demand, because it deals largely with the individual, and thus compensates in some measure for the inequalities that the administration of law, according to general principles, must in the nature of the case produce. I have thus fair dealt only with instances of voluntary sacri- fice. These are, however, comparatively few when placed alongside of those recorded in authentic history and traditional lore, where the human victim is offered against his own will to propitiate an offended deity. Besides, we are rarely in a posi- tion to decide between voluntary and involuntary victims; or at least between those who sought death and those who sub- mitted passively to their fate. When the victims were chil- dren or slaves there is no reason to suppose that they resisted, although non-resistance in such cases and under such circum- stances is not equivalent to voluntary submission. The general proposition, however, is that the ministrant offers a victim to an offended deity as an expiation or atonement for some deed committed or omitted, either intentionally or inadvertently. A typical instance for the Greeks is the sacrifice of Iphigenia at Aulis as a propitiation to Diana whom her father had unwit- tingly incensed. The goddess, however, relented before the consummation. It may be said that the Greeks and Romans of historic times looked upon offerings of this kind with horror, or at least with aversion. The case of Chryses and Achilles set forth at the opening of the Iliad is nothing more nor less than</page><page sequence="8">Vicarious Sacrifice. 451 one of typical priestcraft. The confidant of Apollo used his opportunity, as many priests have since done, to enhance his importance by a skillful interpretation of the plague in the Greek camp as an insult to himself personally. On the other hand, the sacrifice of human beings was com- mon among the Semites, or at least among some of its tribes. In the second Book of Kings it is said that the King of Moab "took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall." Probably the most noteworthy event bearing upon the theme here under consideration is that recorded by Diodorus as having occurred when Carthage was in imminent danger of falling into the hands of Agathocles. This instance is par- ticularly remarkable because of its comparatively late date- about B. C. 300-when one might assume that a comparatively civilized people like the Carthaginians would have advanced beyond the barbarous point of view that it brings into such bold relief. The gravity of the crisis explains the abnormal proceeding. The Greek historian gives a graphic account of the consternation that seized the city when the famous bandit was drawing near. He says the Carthaginians imagined that in some way they had incurred the ill-will of the gods, but particularly that of Heracles the chief god of the city whence they had migrated. They accordingly sent vast sums of money and other valuables to Tyre in the hope that they might -thus appease his anger and win back his favor. In former times it had been their custom to contribute a tenth of their revenues to the divinities of the mother-city. As they became opulent they also became negligent and sent but little. The omission having now been brought to their attention, they began to feel the stings of repentance, and accordingly sent gifts to all the gods, hoping in this way to win back the favor they had forfeited. But they felt that above every other god their disasters were now due to Kronos. To him they had formerly sacrificed sons of the leading citizens; but in the course of time, wishing to spare their own, they had sur- reptitiously bought children and brought them up for the customary oblation. This state of things became known as</page><page sequence="9">452 International Journal of Ethics. the result of an investigation, for no stone had been left un- turned to ascertain where the fault lay. They hesitated long before making the sacrifice; but when they beheld the enemy encamped before their walls they were seized with a panic or frenzy of superstitious fear lest their failure to perform their obligations to the gods would lead to the capture and destruc- tion of the city. With a view to making an atonement for their sins and their former remissness they selected two hun- dred of the noblest youths and immolated them in behalf of the city. Three hundred others who had for some reason become objects of suspicion voluntarily offered themselves; There was in the city a brazen statue of Kronos with arms extended downward, and the boy laid upon them rolled into a pit filled with fire. After the slaughter at Cannae the Romans were in like manner thrown into the wildest consternation, and like the Carthaginians they began to look for a cause. It was found that two of the Vestals had proved untrue to their vows. One of them was accordingly buried under the Colline gate; the other escaped the same fate by committing suicide. The guilty paramour was scourged to death. Two Gauls and two Greeks were sacrificed in the cattle market, also without the shedding of blood. Livy remarks in this connection that such sacrifices had been made before, but that the rite was un-Roman. Here, too, disaster had led to heart-searchings as it had done among the Greeks, among the Carthaginians, and in the case of Achan among the Hebrews, and as it still continues to do among the Christians. The question has often been asked and answered whether ethnic religions, those religions that have been engendered among a people as distinguished from those imposed from without, have any moral influence on conduct for the better. From my study of the subject I have become convinced that it may be truthfully answered both in the affirmative and the negative. The creeds of those tribes that are still, as they have been from time immemorial, on the lowest rungs of civilization have not elevated them in the least. On the other hand, the religious beliefs of those peoples that have made</page><page sequence="10">Vicarious Sacrifice. 453 considerable advances along the highway of progress have had a moralizing influence. This is true of the Greeks, of the Romans, of the Jews and Egyptians, and probably of other nations. That God sometimes commanded the Jews to kill did not make them more bloodthirsty. Such typical oc- currences as the following did not invalidate the command, "Thou shalt not kill." The Lord commanded Moses to say unto Pharaoh: "If thou refuse to let him (my son) go, behold I will slay thy son, even thy first-born." When the Israelites were at Shittim and had fallen into idolatry the Lord waxed angry with them and slew twenty and four thousand. So by the command of the Lord given through Moses all were put to death that had joined themselves to Baal-peor. Similarly Samuel, by command of the Lord, sent Saul against Amalek with orders "to slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass." One cannot read the Greek poets, particularly 2Eschylus and Pindar, without reaching the conviction that they sought to make the current mytho- logical conceptions a support to the moral order of the world. That Zeus sometimes lied and deceived did not furnish any thoughtful Greek or Roman with an excuse for doing likewise. Neither did the thefts of Hermes or the unchastity of Aphrodite provide such a person with a reason for thievery or lewdness in conduct. The God of the Jews, just like the gods of the heathen, were supposed to be a law unto themselves, and might therefore do or command to be done what mortals should neither do nor command. It is often said that the Greeks had no consciousness of sin; that their sense of human dignity and worth precluded the rise of such a feeling in their breasts. It may be that they were not conscious of guilt in the significance the Jews gave to the term. Yet it is hard to see much difference between the feelings of a Greek who realized that he had been intentionally guilty of an offense against a god, or the moral law as repre- sented in him, and the state of mind expressed by the Psalmist when he exclaims: "I acknowledged my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgression unto the Lord." It is interesting to compare this and similar</page><page sequence="11">454 International Journal of Ethics. passages with the story of Glaucus and others of similar im- port. The striking difference in this case lies in the conviction of the Psalmist that the Lord had pardoned his sins, while the Pythia told the custodian of the treasure who had been guilty in thought only that there was no pardon for him. On the other hand, it must be said that not all transgression produced like dolorous results. The Greeks were in possession of means for recovering the lost favor of a god, and they frequently resorted to them. When their affairs went wrong they often found the guilty cause. If the searching party was not willing to admit its own transgression it was usually successful in dis- covering a sinner somewhere in the camp. Many of the Romans were certainly conscious of sin in al- most the exact sense that Paul gave to this state of mind. When he says: "For the good which I would I do not, but the evil which I would not that I practice," he uses the lan- guage of Ovid when he confesses that he sees and approves the better, but follows the worse. The writings of Seneca are permeated with the struggle between the moral sentiments and the weak will which is so often under the sway of base desires. It seems to me we may find here an explanation of the belief in the necessity of expiatory sacrifices. The conscious- ness of guilt arises out of the dissonance between the moral sentiments and the will; or we may perhaps better say, between the unequal development of the moral perceptions and the volitions. Where there is no law there is no transgression, is a truth of universal validity. The consciousness of an innate moral law is attested by the whole course of human history. Nor is it by any means always the fear of temporal punishment that makes men conscious of guilt. Such a feeling is character- istic of the child rather than of the fully developed man. Intelligent Greeks held the belief that the gods were the avengers of wrong-doing. Therefore he who transgressed an ethical statute sinned against them and laid himself liable to such a penalty as they might inflict. This penalty had to be paid unless it could be canceled by a pardon. The philosopher who does a wrong inconsiderately, restores his peace of mind by admitting to himself and to no other person, it may be, his</page><page sequence="12">Vicarious Sacrifice. 455 fault, and by guarding against similar conduct in the future. But in the earlier ages comparatively few persons had reached this high plane: the great majority were simply conscious of having failed in the fulfillment of their obligations. The case would necessarily be envisaged from the anthropomorphic viewpoint. This was a recognition of the necessity of a quid pro quo. We say that Socrates was endowed with exception- ally keen ethical perceptions. He had what we might call a "'tender conscience." Yet it is very doubtful if he was himself aware of this fact. He did not clearly understand his inward parts. He thought he was under the guardianship of a more or less external tutelary divinity. It is a commentary on conduct painful to read when we find in the Psalms, in Isaiah, in Proverbs and -elsewhere in the Old Testament, as well as among the early Greeks, so clear a recog- nition of the principle that our duty towards the Creator does not consist in the performance of ceremonies, but in a life; not in isolated ceremonial acts, but in a course of conduct based on the permanent desire to do right. "Sacrifices and offerings thou hast no delight in." "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit." "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord." "To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice." "For I desired mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings." This quotation from Hosea Christ uses twice in the Gospel according to Matthew. Yet the great majority of mankind still attach far more importance to the performance of rites than to living aright! The mode of sacrifice is determined by the current opinion as to the dwelling-place of God among the Hebrews, and of the ethical gods among the Greeks: these are preeminently Zeus ahd Apollo. When Noah offered a burnt sacrifice the "Lord smelled a sweet savor." This was the only way the gods of the upper air could be regaled with meat, the favorite diet of men. If they always received their share of the feast they would most likely remain in a favorable attitude towards their mortal subjects. All attainable evidence tends to confirm the theory that those tribes whose entire energy is consumed in the</page><page sequence="13">456 International Journal of Ethics. effort to sustain life have only the faintest conception of a moral law. Yet the germ of such a law exists in their minds. Their untoward circumstances effectually prohibit its development. The acorn is not the oak except dynamically; and it will never become an oak unless it be placed in a favorable environment. Human society everywhere, the most advanced no less than the most retarded, furnishes parallel cases. The only difference is that in the latter the entire community is unmoral; in the former it is only a certain class. Here, too, the tendency is constantly upward while in the rudest tribes there is no upper or lower, ethically considered. Hence there arises in civilized communities and under ex- ceptional conditions that consciousness of guilt which is so often exhibited in conversion, sometimes in very dramatic forms. We have here an effort put forth by the repentant sinner to close the rift, now subjectively plain, made by a weak or perverse will, between his better nature, his moral sensibili- ties, his God. We have here waves of emotion beating upon the psychic shores of our own time that were started by our ancestors in the remotest ages. Or, to change the figure, we may say that the initial impulse is the same; the sentiments are the same; the attitude toward moral delinquency is the same; the language spoken is the same. The only difference between our most distant ancestors and our contemporaries is the manner in which this language finds expression, whether in words or in rites. CHARLES W. SUPER.
