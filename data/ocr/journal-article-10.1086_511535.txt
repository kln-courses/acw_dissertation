      <p>In about 1915 in T H Morgan’s laboratory, H J Muller and Alexander Weinstein were talking about evolution and the theory of the gene, when Weinstein (in jest) said “the cell is the gene’s way of making another gene.” Muller enjoyed telling that story to his students because it reflected the view of Morgan’s students that it was the gene that was the fundamental unit of evolution. In 1922, Muller expressed that idea in his paper, Variation Due to Change in the Individual Gene (<italic>American Naturalist</italic> 56:32–50). Muller argued that only the gene had the unusual capacity to copy itself and its mistakes. This was the essential property of the gene and made evolution possible. In 1926, Muller expressed this idea again in a paper, The Gene as the Basis of Life (<italic>Proceedings of the International Congress of Plant Sciences </italic> 1:897–921). Not only evolution, but the entire contents of the cell were products of this unusual property of the gene. In 1936, in his paper, Physics in the Attack on the Fundamental Problems of Genetics (<italic>Scientific Monthly</italic> 44:210–214), Muller characterized the gene as crystal‐like and suggested using x‐ray diffraction on giant chromosomes recently discovered by T S Painter in fruit flies. I once wrote to J D Watson, who took Muller’s course on Mutation and the Gene, and asked if Muller ever discussed that article. Watson sent me his notebook of the course to verify that Muller never mentioned it. The suggestion I cited from the 1936 paper was “[i]n the solution of these problems, and of the general problems of gene composition, one possible line of approach might be through the study of x‐ray diffraction patterns. Preliminary studies of this nature upon the proteins of hair have been made by Astbury and others, at Leeds, but studies of such proteins may be a far call from the study of the gene. But it may be possible for gene material to be used in such investigations. For there exist, in some of the cells of flies, bundles of identical chromonemas conjugated together in hundreds, and these bundles are so large they might even furnish material for an x‐ray diffraction study if we had people of sufficient physical training, combined with biological interest, to tackle such a job” (Muller 1936:213).</p>
      <p>Ideas are more often reborn than born. In 1976, Richard Dawkins published a small, popular book with the startling title <italic>The Selfish Gene.</italic> The title was chosen with care. Dawkins did not claim that selfish genes made selfish people. He acknowledged that it was against prevailing fashion to anthropomorphize the inanimate such as a sequence of nucleotides with a peculiar property of replicating its variations. He did so to shift our thinking about evolution from the species, whether the individual organism or a population, to the “gene’s eye view,” which he characterized as selfish if its behavior could be described in a layperson’s terms. In Dawkins’s insight, the business of a gene is to make more genes. It has no other alleged purpose and what it makes is entirely an accident of its evolutionary history. Natural selection keeps refining products of those genes and those that lead to adaptations, as well as added complexity to serve the sole purpose of that gene which is replication.</p>
      <p>Grafen and Ridley’s book is a Festschrift that celebrates the 30th anniversary of the publication of Dawkins’s most famous book. The authors were restricted to short essays of about 2000 words. There are four essays on Biology; four on The Selfish Gene; four on Logic; three on Antiphonal Voices; three on Humans; five on Controversy; and two on Writing. They vary in their insight and intent. Most are hagiographic, which goes with being a student of Dawkins. Some are critical of his ideas or even his anthropomorphic approach to the gene, but none of his sharpest critics (S J Gould, R Lewontin, or S Rose)—who are characterized in some of the essays as environmentalists of the leftist school of evolution—are represented in this invitational volume. I am not sure that possibly polemic essays would have added to the usefulness of the book. It is a very satisfying collection of commentaries and reflections on issues that are important to scientists, philosophers, theologians, journalists, and teachers. Those who have never read Dawkins will falsely believe the selfish gene makes selfish people myth and they will continue to dismiss his ideas of a gene‐centered evolution as hostile to their concept of a humanity capable of making a better world.</p>
      <p>Much of the book is devoted to the ideas Dawkins has proposed—the selfish gene (or the replicator concept), the idea of the “blind watchmaker” as the metaphor of evolution, the concept of the cultural meme—ideas that pass from mind to mind and become part of culture, the meme as virus‐like when it has pathological effects (especially, from Dawkins’s perspective, those religious ideas, such as creationism or intelligent design, that are at odds with the world‐view shaped by science). Also well developed are the essays from those in the field of evolutionary psychology and its antecedents, sociobiology and biological determinism, who used the selfish gene perspective to generate ways behavior leads to spreading genes (game theory, kin selection, and altruism as a means to favor shared genes among those who are saved by sacrifice).</p>
      <p>I am troubled that a good idea has to be put in a form that grabs attention even if that catchy title or phrase can lead to mischief. Consider Alfred Ploetz’s unfortunate use of the term “race hygiene” in 1905 as a synonym (almost) for eugenics. By shifting the focus of applied human genetics to the “folk” rather than to humanity as a whole or to the individual, Ploetz unintentionally made it appealing to the horrific ideas of race hygiene by the Nazi Party. Eugenics is equally a besmirched term, and all of Muller’s idealism in the late 1950s could not convince his peers that in the form of positive eugenics or germinal choice, it should be revived. Muller failed to convince people about protecting their genes because he could not dodge the stigma of race hygiene and eugenics in the public’s mind. As a result, few scientists seriously want to touch issues such as the long‐term human genetic implications of increasing levels of mutations prevented from natural loss by infertility, defective immune systems, or less efficient organ and tissue functions that are the byproducts of gene mutations. They far outnumber new genes beneficial to survival.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I am aware that if Dawkins called his 1976 classic <italic>Convariant Reproduction</italic> (the term that N V Timofeeff‐Ressovsky gave Muller’s idea of the basic property of the gene) there would not only be no 30‐year Festschrift, but an entire field of evolutionary studies might have been delayed or impoverished.</p>
