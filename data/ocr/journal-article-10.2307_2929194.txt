<plain_text><page sequence="1">KURT WEINBERG Heine and French Poetry In the short fragment of Heine's Memoirs which survived the merciless censorship of his cousin, Karl Heine, the poet avowed his indifference to French literature. "I never loved it as much as it deserves, and, towards French poetry, which was fatal to me in my youth, I have always been singularly unfair." Insensitive to the classical alexandrine, Heine was also unsympathetic to French romantic poetry. He misunderstood, mocked, and despised some of its greatest figures. Yet, at a period when Nerval was still superficially disposed of as a rat', or, at best, as a subtle stylist whose works appeared marred by their "obscurity," Heine recog- nized his stature and felt deeply the delicate purity of his creation. He was aware of parallel experiences, affinities of thought and talent, and saw in Nerval, despite all differences of temperament, a mirror of his own conflicts and contradictions: "I see myself in him." But this was an isolated case, a transfer of identity. Nerval's un- flinching loyalty during the difficult days of 1848, and his services as a translator, singled him out as a friendly island in the gulf which sepa- rated Heine from French poetry. Perhaps rightly, Heine blamed this vigorous dislike on the sinister influence of a certain abbe d'Aulnoi (or Daunoi), an emigrant priest, author of several chrestomathies, an Art oratoire and an Art poetique, who, during the Empire, had taught French and, curiously enough, German history at the Dusseldorf lycee. D'Aulnoi, it seems, had forced his student to translate passages from Klopstock's Messias and to convert its German hexameters into French alexandrines. This singular attempt to arouse enthusiasm for Batteux's stale rules of versification might have forever destroyed Heine's love of poetry. "It was a refinement of cruelty which exceeded all the torments of the Messiah's passion . . ." (Memoirs). This protest conceals, of course, a badly healed wound; d'Aulnoi's ridiculous assignments and the student's inability to handle honorably so obnoxious a task deeply af- fected the pride and sensitivity of the child. Perhaps Heine never quite recovered from this blow to his vanity and here one touches upon a primal cause of his lifelong resentment toward French poetry. Decades later, the self-styled Franco-German mediator in turn despaired and, faute de mieux, resigned himself to that linguistic insufficiency which prevented his ever achieving the synthesis of a bilingual author. His romantic impetuosity, which resulted in a radical break with traditional form and the overthrow of narrow rules, added an element of revolt to this psychological conflict. Intensified by the disappointment of the alien, who, having the "feel" of the French language, does not succeed in 45</page><page sequence="2">Yale French Studies mastering it as a poet, this insurrection against the classical French meter increased steadily. In a well-known diatribe (Memoirs), he mordantly condemned the picturesque paraphrase and the alexandrine, which he called a "rhymed belching." To sacrifice to the exigencies of rigid form the very essence of a poem, its emotional or ideal contents, he considered facile virtuosity. The artist who places above everything the discipline of versification is compared to Procrustes. In order to force his feeble thought into the "straitjacket" of the alexandrine, he arbitrarily shortens or lengthens it in the manner of the Sicilian bandit who lopped off or stretched the feet of his victims until they fit his bed. Thus Heine summarily brushed off classical French poetry. In the first generation of French Romantic poets, he reprehended tendencies toward rhetoric, morbidity, and medieval spiritualism. Pos- sible causes are: (1) his stylistic aspirations which were incompatible with their verbosity; (2) the national bias of a German poet who was skeptical concerning the French language as a means of lyric expres- sion, and who doubted the introspective depth of "poetes raisonneurs"; (3) his petulant and malicious temperament; (4) the hyper-sensitivity of the Jew who saw a source of anti-Semitism in romantic medievalism; (5) the social revolt of a Saint-Simonian and his rejection of legitimism; and (6) acceptance of a Hegelian cosmology which precludes any revival of past values. (1) Heine the stylist.- A. Sichel noted pertinently: ". . Hein- rich Heine's German was a very special German, almost a language apart, a language of short sentences, without precedent in the Germanic tongue." He added that the poet evidently formed his idiom "by study- ing the French of the encyclopedists, the French of Diderot" (Journal des Goncourt, vol. VII, p. 28). Indeed, Diderot exerted perhaps the most important single influence on German poetics from Lessing, who drew on him for the Hamburgische Dramaturgie, to Goethe, who characterized the Essai sur la peinture as "a magnificent work which speaks even more effectively to the poet than to the painter" (letter to Schiller, December 1796). Goethe's translation of Le Never de Rameau (1804-1805) was as familiar to Heine as, doubtless, La Religi- euse and Jacques le Fataliste. Freely circulating in Germany, where they were distributed to subscribers of Grimm's Correspondance, these works must have found their way into Betty Heine's library, for the poet's mother was an ardent enthusiast for the encydopedic movement. Probably acquainted from childhood with Diderot, Heine, who has called himself ironically a "German nightingale who built his nest in Monsieur de Voltaire's wig," might perhaps more justly have alluded to his affinities with the ebullient genius of the editor of the Encyclopedie. With Heine, 46</page><page sequence="3">KURT WEINBERG Diderot's style, enriched, more capricious and, at the same time, more finished, finds its pendant in German literature. For, though the Sturm und Drang poets had extracted the essence of their esthetics from Diderot, they had not assimilated his style. Heine the stylist was then an innovator of revolutionary originality. If he failed to become a bilingual author, if in France his works were known only in translation, he found an ingenious solution in a virtual synthesis of the two idioms, for he wrote German as if it were French. He overthrew the tradition of German composition with its long sentences full of cumbersome phrases, which roll along slowly, gravely, pompously toward infinity. For decorous inelegance he substituted clearly delimited, rapid, vivacious, elliptical word-sequences; the metaphor which, vehicle and tenor, points back to its source in a concrete reality humorously fusing with it; the sous-entendu which takes the place of pedestrian expostulation. In short, he used the full repertoire of eighteenth-century French wit. Simultaneously Heine, the Romantic, like Balzac and Hugo, was a pro- digious creator of neologisms. He freed himself from Klopstock's and Goethe's bias against words of foreign origin. Germanising vocables which he borrowed from classical and modern languages, he enriched the German idiom. His conciseness did not leave him short-winded. Images invaded his mind in a vertiginous succession, and he put them on paper without censorship as they offered themselves to consciousness. However, writing from the stylistic distance of an aristocratic simplicity, he avoided the bathos of lamentations a la Rene or Jocelyn. A psychologi- cal sense of shame prevented the direct expression of his mal du siecle. He concealed the nakedness of his soul behind a warrior mask of cynicism. The Lied, simple, naive in its movement, but abruptly twisting into bitter irony, irony almost always directed at the poet himself, was his favorite means of expression. With cruel logic he drove self-analysis to its bitter consequence of self-persiflage. The author mocked his own wounds with a laughter that brutally detached itself from the back- ground of melancholia against which it was projected. Can we not de- tect here a variante of Stendhal's egotism, particularly since Heine shared certain of Stendlhal's literary antipathies (Chateaubriand, Madame de Stadl, Lamartine, etc.)? Evidently, a poet who confronts his own weak- ness with contempt is unsympathetic to tearful rhetoric and vulgar sighs. (2) National bias.-French ". . . is the mother tongue of common sense and universal intelligibility," (De l'Allemagne). In other terms, the ideal idiom of the prose writer, who speaks the language of "reason," but inappropriate for lyric expression, and still less appropriate for depicting the bizarre. Utterly contemptuous of Madame de Sta6l, in whom he saw "a Robespierre in skirts" writing a dangerous panegyric 47</page><page sequence="4">Yale French Studies on Germany "with the sole intention of vexing the Emperor," Heine did not entirely escape the influence of her literary theories. Achim von Arnim and E. T. A. Hoffmann were, he thought, necessarily products of the North. Their writings reflect the climate, nature, and shadowy myths of Germany expressed in an idiom whose chiaoroscuro lends itself to the symbolism of dream and nightmare. These elements, he suggested, are alien to the temperament as well as to the language of the French: Oh witty Frenchmen! you should realize that the terrible is not your forte, and that France is not the soil on which spectres might dwell . . . Poor French writers! you remind me of children who put masks before their faces to frighten each other. The masks are grave and terrible, but through the eyeholes one perceives happy children's glances. Heine, De l'Allemagne From the time of his arrival in Paris, Heine was an amused habitue of the Petit-Cenacle, described so nostalgically by Nerval in his Bohdme galante. To this group of artists, littgrateurs, and poets belonged Gautier, Auguste Maquet, Jules Vabre, Alphonse Brot, Celestin Nanteuil, Na- poleon Tom, Joseph Bouchardy, Philotee O'Neddy, and Jean Dusseigneur. Its leader was the promising but disappointing Petrus Borel. Heine was possibly thinking of the recent failure of Borel's Champavert when, in 1834, he advised French writers to leave the doubtful beauties of lycan- thropism and vampiric reveries to their fellows across the Rhine, and to affirm, instead the emancipating mission of France, country of the revolution. Attempting to limit the scope of French literature to works of "reason," he ridiculed a priori any romantic effort to deepen French poetry by opening it to mystery. His deplorable counsel: Stick to witty prose, revolutionary chants, and vaudeville. No wonder he considered Beranger the greatest poet of his time! (3) Difficulties of temperament.-Petulance and malice in Heine's temperament had the strength of passions. He could not resist the temptation of the bon-mot. His whims got the better of Heine the critic; he overstated his opinions and sacrificed friendships to witticisms. But at the same time he was good-natured and repentant, and could not understand why friends suddenly turned away from him. "Heine tried to appear worse than he actually was," asserts Weill (Souveni~rs intimes, p. 74). Heine alienated Hugo by calling him a "hunchback," Musset by giving him the epithets "urchin" and "impotent," and he estranged Beranger by conferring upon him the title of "scoundrel." Yet these are the men he admired as the greatest poets of France. (4) "Racism," (5) Saint-Simonism, and (6) Cosmic revolt.- "Anti-Semitism only begins with the [German] Romantic School, with 48</page><page sequence="5">KURT WEINBERG its predilection for the Middle-Ages, Catholicism, nobility of birth; it increases with teutomania," (Gedanken und Einfdlle). Anti-Semitism and his own hereditary Judaism, Heine resented with equal vigor. Despite his Protestant baptism, Catholic marriage, and religious syncretism, he was incapable of shaking off the burden of his Jewish origin, and found himself fighting a lifelong battle against "racist" persecutors. French Romanticism he feared as a dangerous attempt at emulating the German movement in its worst, reactionary aspects. "The new Romantic poets of France are the dilettantes of Christendom. They exalt the Church but fail to obey Christian symbols: they are catholiques marrons." Since this criticism does not apply to Hugo, Musset, Vigny: did Heine have in mind minor Catholic poets, like Turquety, or men of Lamartine's stature? Again, he may have had Chateaubriand in mind. But in the 1830's Chateaubriand was most assuredly no longer a "new Romantic poet." Be this as it may, Catholicism in France stood for counter-revolu- tionary ideas. As legitimists, French Catholics were the defenders of aristocratic privileges, but at the same time supporters of the new ruling class of financial and industrialist bourgeoisie. Lamennais, the dissident ex- ception to this rule, was excommunicated. Against a religion of the past, the Heine of the 1830's upheld Saint-Simonism, a para-religious system with room for sensualist, terrestrial thought, a social creed with the promise of a new golden age that would end "Man's exploitation of Man." Here he thought he had found a humanitarian and humanist religion which admitted neither pure spiritualism nor the vague pantheism of a Victor Hugo who extended his cosmic pity down to the stone, lowest manifestation of his "ladder of Being." Heine's pantheism was of a different order. To him "thought is nature invisible, nature is thought visible."' He revolted against the idea of a spiritual God, a concept as "absurd as brutal anthropomorphism, for spiritual attributes would be meaningless and ridiculous without physical ones" (Gedanken und Einfcille). But Heine was above all a sensualist for whom the soul is a This Spinozist psycho-physical parallelism, along with the Hegelian Weltgeist concept and a certain latent Platonism, seems to be essential to Heine's esthetics. Opposed to the rational pluralist, whom we have made the object of this short study, there exists the intuitive Heine, the anthropomorphic poet, the creator of myths. Baudelaire, quoting Kunstberichte aus Paris (1831), reveals Heine's belief in artistic creation as a "supernatural" process, born from a "mystical dependence." It is this Heine who considers the artist's mind as an arsenal of archetypes, many of which have no "copy" in Nature. They exist as "eingeborene Symbolik eingeborener Ideen, gleichsam in der Seele geoffenbart . . ." Much is to be said about the contiguity of Heine to and his divergence from the early symbolists (Novalis, Baudelaire, etc). He attains this isolation by pre- venting his thought,-psychological in its nature, as Albert Beguin points out in L'Ame romantique et le reve, pp. 323-326, and social, as one might add- from transgressing into the sphere of metaphysics. But this is subject matter for another study. 49</page><page sequence="6">Yale French Studies temporary manifestation of the senses which dies with the body. His pantheism admitted no metempsychosis. The law of the Universe is multi- plicity. Animal, vegetable, and mineral species live, die, decay, and transform themselves in a perpetual and completely material process. They are mutually exclusive categories, not linked by any bonds of sensitivity or intelligence. One can admire the beauty of a landscape, a flower, a tiger, but what he admires is a human projection into the external world; he cannot feel as a landscape, as a flower, as a tiger. This resulted in a total absence of cosmic pity in Heine's thought. "The Earth is that great rock to which Man, the true Prometheus, is chained, and where he is eternally devoured by the vulture of doubt." Surrounded by mystery, we cannot break through the walls of human fate. Universal evil, to Man, appears only in the form of human suffering, cosmic revolt is possible only on the human plane and filters into social revolt. It is solidarity with the vanquished and oppressed, sanctification of human misery, a humanism which is clearly set off from that vague feeling of "universal brotherhood" which runs through Hugo's poetry. Instead of seeking a refuge that might transcend humanity, Heine accepted his hu- man condition and engaged himself in a social religion which reclaimed the flesh and proclaimed the perfectibility of Man and society. Hugo's sentimentality repelled him; he saw in it (wrongly, perhaps) a sterile tenderness to which he opposed his dynamic social faith. The Saint-Simon- ian doctrines attracted him not only by their hedonism, but also by the paradox of their political ideas. Aiming at the emancipation of all men, it recognized nonetheless the primacy of the artist, the intellectual, the poet, and established an aristocracy of merit which it substituted for the legitimist aristocracy of birth. Thus, simultaneously sensualist, democratic and aristocratic, it satisfied the complexity of Heine's own nature by paralleling it. Ultimately, he was closer to Hugo than he thought; he believed in the prophetic and mystic mission of the poet, in his sacerdotal avocation. What opposed him to Hugo, to the medieval aspirations of the Burgraves ("the garbage of the German Romantic kitchen"), to the Gothic, "morgue and cadaver" novelists, the vampirists and lycan- thropists was his unshakable faith in the necessity for social progress. Heine's Tannhduser exemplifies this humanist creed. Glorifying Hellenism at the expense of feudalist taste, the legend of the knight who returns into the arms of Venus after a temporary sojourn in medieval Germany, represents the triumph of profane over sacred love, of sensualism over the spiritualist nightmare of the Middle Ages, and, symbolically, the victory of Saint-Simonian emancipation, the promise of an earthly para- dise which would forever annihilate the pale dream of a Christian beyond. 50</page><page sequence="7">KURT WEINBERG When his poems betray his social impatience, his hatred, his rage, his petulance appear with least restraint. The poet is a magician more powerful than the mighty of this earth. Like Dante, the exile can pro- vide a dubious immortality for his enemies, condemning them to roast forever in the inferno of his tercets. "No God, no Saviour can redeem you from these singing flames..." Heine triumphantly warned the king of Prussia, echoing the Internationale in the final stanzas of Deutschland, ein Wintermdrchen. His voice attained revolutionary accents unsurpassed in any literature in poems such as Die Wanderratten, Die schlesischen Weber. But if his verses reflect an uncompromising hatred for the powerful, they also express a profound compassion for and solidarity with the oppressed, an identification with the vanquished whose cause he championed. But perhaps the false situation of Heine the exile is a primary key to the understanding of his irritation with the French Romantics. He was feted in the salons of Lafayette, Princess Belgiojoso and Caroline Jaubert. Among his friends he counted Balzac, Berlioz, Thierry, Mignet, Nerval, Gautier, George Sand, Houssaye, Buloz. Arriving in Paris with his literary reputation already well established on both sides of the Rhine, he was immediately translated, his works published in the Europe litteraire, and the Revue des Deux ZMondes, by Eugene Renduel and, later, Michel Levy. Although his books were crowned by instant success, he was disquieted by the question which perturbs every author in exile: was he still in touch with his German public? Leader of janges Deatschland, a movement of liberal litterateurs, his works were pro- hibited in most German states, and mutilated beyond recognition by censorship in the rest. Besides, despite his cosmopolitanism, he felt as an alien, isolated: "Denk' ich an Deutschland in der Nacht, / Dann bin ich urn den Schlaf gebracht . . ." In vain he hoped for the penetra- tion in Germany of French emancipating ideas. Unable to influence German politics, as a refugee he was kept from playing a role in French political life. In the presence of these frustrations he was impatient with Musset's dandyism, Hugo's and Lamartine's political opportunism, and Chateaubriand's legitimist aspirations. These powerful minds should have been serving the progressive forces of Europe. But he realized that his perspective was probably distorted, and that, if he were French, his attitude would have been different. If I were a French poet, I should live like Musset, Hugo, and Gautier, I should write novels and plays, or launch myself in politics, become a depute, or anything. But I am a German. France generously offers me hospitality, not only that I may live here freely and happily, but to serve me as a rampart and detached out- 51</page><page sequence="8">Yale French Studies post, whence I must fire on my enemies in Germany, whom I consider the enemies of the spirit of progress, the enemies of freedom of conscience, the enemies of mankind. Heine, quoted by Weill, Souvenirs intimes, pp. 54-55. Heine's severe, mocking, and unfair judgments on French Romantic- ism are perhaps understood best when seen in the light of his partisan spirit. Heine the critic remained an "intellectual freebooter," whose at- titude toward French classicism was largely determined by malign child- hood experiences, while his criticism of contemporary French poetry was distorted by the fears and resentments of the exile, and the extra- literary bias of his social ideas. To what extent these concepts influenced his criticism even of the French classicists is revealed in a passage on Corneille and Racine. While, in the best Hegelian tradition, the former is pointed out as the last great defender of feudalism, the latter is upheld as the first representative of that modern spirit of revolt from which sprang the French Revolution. Heine the subtle, nervous, impetuous laugher was primarily an engage, a combatant unsympathetic to the passive, the sentimental, the tearful. He wanted to be and was an enlightening flame, "I am the sword, I am the flame . . ." This unsentimental engagement of almost Jansenist purity, perhaps the most salient trait of his complex personality, isolates him from Hugo and Lamartine and points him out as astonishingly modern, and, in certain respects, even the spiritual contemporary of Sartre, Camus, Breton, Eluard, and Aragon.
