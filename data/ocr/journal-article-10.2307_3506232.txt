Nancy Cartwright's newest book, The Dappled World, seeks to extend the project begun in her first, How the Laws of Physics Lie. (1983) The first book provided a much needed wake-up call. Attention to how sci- ence actually writes and applies theories shows a picture much at odds with the familiar view of deduction from a few completely general natural laws. In (1983:139-42) Cartwright described "physics as theatre". Just as a stage per- formance succeeds if it gets across the important ideas and attitudes embod- ied in a form that streamlines the details of real life, the theoretical descriptions provided by science succeed when, and in many ways because, they abstract from and simplify the welter of actual experience. At the other end science deals, not with "raw data", but "prepared descriptions" carefully manicured to abstract the relevant aspects of experience in a way that can smoothly be brought into contact with abstract theory. (1983: 133) It is likewise a primary motivating theme of the present book that descrip- tion of theory as deduction from natural laws leaves out or hopelessly distorts how science works. For example, Cartwright objects that in interpretive work on the measurement problem in quantum mechanics ... the literature tends to live inside the mathematical structure of quantum theory and seldom asks how that theory serves to model the world. Sometimes this is even done consciously, with the division of labour as a rationale: we study physics theory, modelling is a different matter, one of applied physics. [But as a result, Cartwright suggests] ... [w]hat is left out in the usual studies in foundations of physics is not how the physics is applied, but rather, as [Willis] Lamb urges, the physics.

This is a crucially impor- tant development in the interpretation of science. However, Dappled does not succeed in carrying this program forward. Here is an initial sketch of Dappled and the plan for the present review. (1983) argued that one must do a lot of intellectual and, often, practical engi- neering to get a fit between abstract theory and messy real world situations. Cartwright's second book (1989) argued that capacities are respectable proper- ties and that reference to capacities is essential in the operation of science. Dappled pursues the themes of both prior books. The leading idea is oppo- sition to "fundamentalism". Citing Neurath, one of her heroes, Cartwright explains: 'The system' for Neurath is the one great scientific theory into which all the intel- ligible phenomena of nature can be fitted, a unique, complete and deductively closed set of precise statements. Neurath taught: 'The' system is the great scien- tific lie. (6. See also 6-9, 23) Cartwright pursues the anti-fundamentalist theme using examples from phys- ics and economics, of which the present review will explicitly address only the former. The larger argument proceeds on two independent fronts. One approach argues for limitations of theory: Theories and their principles are described as abstract. To apply abstract descriptions one must fill them out with concrete realizations. However, in thus rendering abstract descriptions con- crete, Cartwright claims, the domain of applicability of theory is severely lim- ited. The main argument for this last claim comes in chapter 8, which will be examined in detail below. The second line of argument attempts to realize a program set in (1989: see, e.g., 8 and 229). Cartwright claims that in nature disorder predominates. Order occurs only in the special pockets that constitute "nomological machines", that is, special assemblies, usually of human construction, that orchestrate the capacities of specific components to produce a reliable regular- ity. For the most part regularity in nature is thus restricted to what can be described by a, mostly humanly produced, "patchwork of laws". Section 2 will examine the argument of chapter 8 for the claimed limits placed on theory by the need to make the abstract more concrete. This inspec- tion will provide a closer examination than is customary for a review in order to show clearly the ways in which this book exhibits serious shortcomings of detail, shortcomings the likes of which readers will find throughout the book.4 Section 3 will then more briefly examine the network of ideas connecting laws, capacities, and nomological machines.</page><page sequence="3">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 701 2. Limitations on Theory. In chapter 8 Cartwright intends to support Dap- pled's overall anti-fundamentalist thesis by arguing for The Limitation Claim: Considerations about the role of bridge principles and inter- pretative models show that theories are seriously limited in what they can tell about the world.5 In her words, "My principal thesis is... that the way our theories get applied- even when they co-operate-puts serious limits on what we can expect them to do." (182-3) Evaluation of this thesis and Cartwright's discussion of it requires a sketch of the framework within which she presents it. 2.1 The Framework for the Limitation Claim. Cartwright begins her exposi- tion of what she expects to do in this chapter by writing that I want to argue that the fundamental principles of theories in physics do not repre- sent what happens; rather, the theory gives purely abstract relations between abstract concepts. For the most part, it tells us the capacities or natures of systems that fall under these concepts. As we saw in chapter 3, no specific behaviour is fixed until those systems are located in very specific kinds of situations. When we want to represent what happens in these situations we will need to go beyond theory and build a model, a representative model. (180, see also 181, 184) Representative models provide the context for the chapter's main topic: For a large number of our contemporary theories, such as quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, classical mechanics and classical electromagnetic theory, when we wish to build a representative model in a systematic or principled way, we shall need to use a second kind of model [called an interpretative model]. For all of these theories use abstract concepts, 'abstract' in the sense developed in chap- ter 2 [summarized below].... The models that do this are laid out within the theory itself in its bridge principles. (180) Cartwright next makes the point that ... we can put together what we know from quantum theory with much else we know to draw conclusions that are no part of the theory in the deduc- tive sense. The knowledge expressed in physics' fundamental principles provides a very powerful tool for building models of phenomena.... But the models require a co-operative effort.... [K]nowledge must be col- lected from where we can find it, well outside the boundaries of what any single theory says.... And not just knowledge but guesses too. (181) After an example Cartwright continues:</page><page sequence="4">702 NOUS The first point I want to urge in this chapter then is one about how far the knowl- edge contained in the theories of physics can go towards producing accurate pre- dictive models when these theories are set to work co-operatively with what else we know or are willing to guess for the occasion. (182) However: My principal thesis is less optimistic. For I shall also argue that the way our theo- ries get applied-even when they co-operate-puts serious limits on what we can expect them to do. (182-3) This is the Limitation Claim. Cartwright's next section outlines the received syntactic and semantic views and her dissatisfaction with them, which she epitomizes by describing both as ... cases of the 'vending machine' view. The theory is a vending machine: you feed it input in certain prescribed forms for the desired output; it gurgitates for a while; then it drops out the sought-for representation, plonk, on the tray, fully formed.... (184) Indeed, she concludes that "... the whole point of the tradition that generates [the syntactic and semantic] views is the elimination of creativity-or whim-in the use of theory to treat the world." (185) According to Cartwright, The first step beyond the vending machine view are various accounts that take the deductive consequences of a single theory as the ideal for building representa- tive models but allow for some improvements [Cartwright's footnote 17 here reads: "It is important to keep in mind that what is suggested are changes to the original models that often are inconsistent with the principles of the theory.], usually improvements that customise the general model produced by the theory to the spe- cial needs of the case at hand. (186) And she cites Giere's (1988) as an example of such a "customizing account". Cartwright then says that "I shall go step-by-step through what I think is wrong with the customisation story." (186) The footnote and citation of Giere strongly suggest that the account up for criticism is one not committed to customiza- tion that works by application of universally applicable laws, that is, an account not committed to fundamentalism. But she then comments that "If the correc- tions required are ad hoc or are at odds with the theory" the customization story "will not speak for the universality of the theory. So we need not con- sider these kinds of corrections here." (186-7) The ensuing criticism (187-8) appears to be aimed at a view committed to fundamentalism in the form of requiring the customizing corrections all to be underwritten by fundamental</page><page sequence="5">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 703 theory. The criticism is simply her skepticism that this can generally be done in real life cases. While this skepticism has been thoroughly aired in the previ- ous chapters, this reviewer found little by way of substantive argument for it-see below section 3, especially the examination of the wind-blown thou- sand dollar bill in 3.3. Finally, the extended discussion of the BCS model that follows in this chap- ter looks much like the "customisation story". It would have been helpful if Cartwright had explained how the two differ. Section 4, "Bridge principles and interpretative models", turns to discuss- ing these two notions, which will be needed in developing the Limitation Claim. Cartwright begins: I have made a point of mentioning bridge principles, which get little press nowa- days, because they are of central importance both practically and philosophically. Practically, bridge principles are a first step in what I emphasise as a sine qua non of good theory-the use of theory to effect changes in the world. They also indicate the limitations we face in using any particular theory, for the bridge prin- ciples provide natural boundaries on the domain the theory can command. (188) Cartwright does not further discuss the practical role of bridge principles in "the use of theory to effect changes in the world." The role of bridge princi- ples in limiting use of theory is, or is an essential part of, the Limitation Claim to be examined below. Throughout there is repeated mention of interplay between bridge princi- ples and interpretative models. Readers who hope that this section will clarify the relation between bridge principles and interpretative models will not learn anything that improves on page 180's statement that interpretative models "... are laid out within the theory itself in its bridge principles." The most specific descriptions given (in this and later sections) are: In the successful uses of classical mechanics, force functions are not applied to situations that satisfy arbitrary descriptions but only to those situations that can be fitted to one of the standard interpretative models by bridge principles of the theory; so too for all of physics' abstract terms that I have seen in producing the predictions that give us confidence in the theory. (191) and Here I am concerned with the place of bridge principles in our reconstructed theo- ries. The quantum Hamiltonian is abstract in the sense of 'abstract' I have been describing: we apply it to a situation only when that situation is deemed to satisfy certain other more concrete descriptions. These are the descriptions provided by the interpretative models of quantum mechanics. (194-5; see also 3, 4, 43-8)</page><page sequence="6">704 NOlUS A statement quickly following the last quote is particularly puzzling, as it reads The quantum bridge principles give the corresponding Hamiltonians for each of the concrete interpretative models available in quantum mechanics. They provide an abstract Hamiltonian description for situations otherwise described more con- cretely. (195) Since, following common usage, Cartwright refers to the harmonic oscillator (204) and electron scattering (208) Hamiltonians while also citing the har- monic oscillator and "scattering" as interpretive models (195) it is not clear what she intends as the "abstract Hamiltonian description" corresponding to each of the "concrete interpretive models." Nowhere does she give an exam- ple or guidance that will help the reader work out what the relata-the abstract Hamiltonian and the concrete interpretive model-are supposed to be in the way she did in chapter 2 where she illustrates the way in which the abstract descriptions of the Coulomb and Newtonian force laws are made concrete by specifying specific masses, charges and distances. (see 39, 44) Since this examination has failed to discern how bridge principles and inter- pretative models are related to each other, indeed, failed to discern any distinc- tion between the two, the following will refer to them collectively as "BP/IMs". Cartwright also claims that in performing their function of providing con- crete descriptions for things otherwise described more abstractly the BP/IMs function to provide principled as opposed to ad hoc concrete renderings of abstract concepts: My claim about bridge principles and the limits of quantum physics is straightfor- ward. Some theoretical treatments of empirical phenomena use ad hoc Hamilto- nians. But these are not the nice cases that give us really good reasons to believe in the truth of the theory. For this we need Hamiltonians assigned in a principled way; and for quantum mechanics as it is practised that means ones that are licensed by principles of the theory-by bridge principles. (195-also 195 page top, 193, 202, 209) Cartwright reiterates the requirement of principled application at least five times in the chapter; but, as will appear, this requirement runs into conflicts, never resolved, with other of the chapter's themes. To understand the function of BP/IMs in providing concrete descriptions for things otherwise described more abstractly readers need to know how Cart- wright intends the distinction between abstract and concrete descriptions. She has already presented her understanding of this distinction in chapter 2 where she gives two necessary conditions (39): First, a concept that is abstract relative to another more concrete set of descrip- tions never applies unless one of the more concrete descriptions also applies.</page><page sequence="7">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 705 And, Second, satisfying the associated concrete description that applies on a particular occasion is what satisfying the abstract description consists in on that occasion. These conditions are illustrated with examples: What did I do this morning? I worked. More specifically, I washed the dishes, then I wrote a grant proposal, and... I negotiated with the dean for a new position in our department.... It is true that I worked; but it is not true that I did four things in the morning rather than three. Working is a more abstract description of the same activities I have already described when I say that I washed dishes, wrote a proposal, and bargained with the dean. (40) And, On my account force is to be regarded as an abstract concept.... It is not a new separate property, different from any of the arrangements which exhibit it. In each case being in this arrangement-for example, being located at a distance r from another massive body-is what it is to be subject to the appropriate force. (44-5) In the section 4 of chapter 8 Cartwright gives readers some additional examples ... physics needs bridge principles because a large number of its most important descriptive terms do not apply to the world directly; rather, they function as abstract terms. The quantum Hamiltonian, the classical force function and the electromag- netic field vectors are all abstract. Whenever they apply there is always some more concrete description that also applies and that constitutes what the abstract con- cept amounts to in the given case. Mass, charge, acceleration, distance, and the quantum state are not abstract. When a particle accelerates at 32 ft/sec2, there is nothing further that constitutes the acceleration. (189) These examples may, if anything, diminish readers' grip on the distinction. When a particle is subjected to a force of one dyne, why is it not likewise true that there is nothing further that constitutes the force? The present reviewer was unable to answer this question by returning to the more extended discus- sion in chapter 2 where the relevant claim about force was asserted but not argued. (39, 44-6) All the quantities here mentioned would appear to admit of being understood in the sense of determinables and their determinate val- ues. In chapter 2 Cartwright made it clear that the abstract/concrete distinc- tion is not the same as the one she wants to draw between determinables and their values. (41) When it comes to determinate values of, e.g., force vs. accel- eration, one might agree that there is an intuitive contrast: One can know that an object is subject to a specific force by knowing how that force arises, e.g., as an instance of F = GMm/r2, where we would not count this "source" as a</page><page sequence="8">706 NOUS cause, while nothing comparable appears to hold for the case of acceleration. However, mass, on Cartwright's list of concrete concepts, would appear to work in this respect just like force: having a mass of one gram can be realized by being Icc of water or .052cc of gold or.... The discussion in the next section is likely to leave readers yet more puz- zled about how Cartwright intends one to understand the abstract/concrete dis- tinction and the role it is supposed to play in her account. Cartwright cautions that one should "... not ... think of the models linked to Hamiltonians as pictur- ing individually isolatable physical mechanisms, otherwise we will go wrong on a number of fronts." (192) There follow four problems to which the "phys- ical mechanisms" approach to the abstract/concrete distinction gives rise: First we can easily confuse my claim that Hamiltonians are abstract descriptions needing the more concrete descriptions provided by interpretative models with a demand that the Hamiltonians be explained by citing some physical mechanisms supposed to give rise to them. The two claims are distinct. Throughout quantum theory we regularly find bridge principles that link Hamiltonians to models that do not describe physical mechanisms in this way. (192) But if "satisfying the associated concrete description that applies on a par- ticular occasion is what satisfying the abstract description consists in on that occasion" (39), what is there left to explain after one is given the concrete description that specifies what, on the occasion, satisfying the abstract descrip- tion consists in? The antecedent cause of the physical situation embodying the concrete Hamiltonian would hardly seem relevant in this context, and it is not clear what else Cartwright might have in mind. Second, it could dispose one to a mistaken reification of the separate terms which compose the Hamiltonians we use in modelling real systems. (192) The point here is that in applying a Hamiltonian to characterize a "concrete" situation one may split it up in ways that reflect mathematical convenience rather than accurate description. But if so, then how does the "concrete" description tell one what on the occasion satisfying the abstract description con- sists in? Third, without a broader notion of representation than one based on some simple idea of picturing we should end up faulting some of our most powerful models for being unrealistic. (193) Cartwright then cites the example of quantizing the harmonic oscillator com- ponents of a field in the case of second/field quantization. The point is that if such descriptions were read literally they would appear to describe collec- tions of mechanical oscillators. But any such oscillators are entirely fictional.</page><page sequence="9">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 707 In this kind of case it is again hard to see how the "concrete" description tells one in what-really-satisfying the abstract description consists. Last, we make it easy to overlook the fact that when we want to use physics to effect changes in the world we not only need ways to link the abstract descrip- tions from high theory to the more concrete descriptions of models; we also need ways to link the models to the world. (193) Earlier Cartwright had, in introducing BP/IMs, said that "Abstract terms apply to the world via bridge principles." (190) The statement just quoted from (193) suggests that instead BP/IMs work to specify representative models. Through- out this chapter Cartwright moves, without comment, between saying that BP/IMs apply abstract terms to the world and saying that, as she acknowl- edges on 58, BP/IMs work to formulate representative models that, at least often and in all of Cartwright's examples in this chapter, are still abstract and still in need of being related to physical situations. The conflation of relatively specific but still abstract representations with representations of specific physical systems in the real world works to obscure the following possible way of understanding this material: It now appears that BP/IMs are making the abstract concepts of the original theory more concrete only by and insofar as they make them more specific. They certainly do not specify in what satisfying an abstract concept consists in the real world. In other words, it would seem one can go a good way towards addressing the four problems with the "physical mechanisms" approach to the "abstract/ concrete" distinction enumerated just above by making the following specifi- cation: BP/IMs increase the respects in which descriptions are more concrete by making them more specific, by filling in detail even if the detail is still abstractly described. Discussion below will return to this suggestion.6 In working to understand what Cartwright has in mind by the abstract/ concrete distinction and how BP/IMs function in a principled way to provide abstract descriptions with more concrete correlates it might help to have exam- ples. On page 195 Cartwright gives examples: Albert Messiah's old text Quantum Mechanics provides four basic interpretative models: the central potential, scattering, the Coulomb interaction and the har- monic oscillator-to which we should add the kinetic energy, which is taken for granted in his text. The quantum bridge principles give the corresponding Hamil- tonians for each of the concrete interpretative models available in quantum mechan- ics. (195) But Cartwright gives no discussion of these examples, and in many respects readers may find them counterproductive. To begin with, what does Cartwright mean by the interpretative model called "scattering"? She gives no page numbers to Messiah's text, and scattering and</page><page sequence="10">708 NOUS collision problems are discussed in many places in the two volumes. Messiah (1961) explicitly discusses both the Coulomb (421-30) and the central (385-9) potentials as scattering potentials. The central potential, that is any potential of the form V(r), is a special case of an externally imposed potential, which Cartwright does not include on her list. Messiah studies the central potential, V(r), under various simplifying assumptions such as potentials falling off faster than 1/r (369, 371), and potentials describing a hard sphere (393-5) or a deep square well. (396-9) For the Born approximation V(r) is assumed to be "suf- ficiently small". (405-6) But in principle, any externally imposed potential can serve as a scattering potential. As mentioned, Cartwright insists that BP/IMs should give principled speci- fications of a Hamiltonian. Such a claim might be argued in the cases of the kinetic energy and the Coulomb potential. But it is hard to see how the "inter- pretative models" of the harmonic oscillator and scattering-the latter presum- ably externally imposed potentials-are going to play much of a role in the licensing of more concrete descriptions. In particular, in the case of external potentials BP/IMs do no more than allow any external potential of conve- nience. Instead considerations external to the theory in question, sometimes aided by aspects of the theory other than the BP/IM, justify the external poten- tial chosen, as, for example in semi-classical approximations, such as the ones mentioned in Cartwright's discussion of BCS and in other examples in chap- ter 9. Although Cartwright has specified the Coulomb interaction as one of the "basic" BP/IMs, in the many body problems of condensed matter physics usu- ally any direct application of the Coulomb potential is mathematically intracta- ble. Most often in such situations practitioners appeal to one of a variety of approximation methods, such as the independent particle approximation (e.g., Messiah 1961: 615),' that give the averaged effect of the Coulomb interaction of a large number of charged particles but without in any way calculating or deriving this from the Coulomb interaction itself. In fact, Cartwright herself mentions this model as applied in the Fermi-Thomas approach (202-3-again, discussed in Messiah 1961: 615 ff.) It is puzzling how Cartwright thinks the Coulomb interaction functions in the BCS account. She writes that "It is sig- nificant for my central point about the limits of theory that the only kind of Hamiltonian used to describe this underlying model is the one for the Cou- lomb potential." (206) Never mind that she has on the previous page made it clear that the coupled harmonic oscillator is also used in developing the model in question. In the next paragraph she observes that this "underlying model" is mathematically intractable, so new models are substituted, and these new models clearly use the kind of averaging substitutes for the Coulomb poten- tial mentioned above as well as by Cartwright herself. (203; see also her description of the Bloch Hamiltonian, 200-2 and 206-7) In the case of the harmonic oscillator, the BP/IM simply specifies the func- tional form of the Hamiltonian as p2/m+ kx2. In the main this is attractive</page><page sequence="11">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 709 because of its mathematical tractability. Cartwright concurs: "The harmonic approximation is justified first of all on the grounds of its mathematical conve- nience." (205) In fact this approximation is a special application of the strat- egy of using the first terms of a Taylor expansion, justified when, and only when, the term or terms retained give an adequate approximation for the prob- lem at hand. However, whether such an approximation is adequate is fixed not by the theory but by the problem to which it is applied. Thus, as in the case of an eternally imposed potential, the warrant is external to the BP/IM. This consideration of Cartwright's examples of BP/IMs would seem to encourage the suggestion offered above, that what she calls BP/IMs work by providing more specific, if still highly abstract, descriptions for what is less specifically described in the "general theory". So, for example, where quan- tum mechanic's "general principles" mention a Hamiltonian without specify- ing its functional relation to other dynamical variables of the theory, what Cartwright calls "BP/IMs" give a menu of more specific functional forms-of more specific functional relations to other variables of the theory-that in prac- tice have been found useful in specific applications. Thus, a representative model-a model that is still highly abstract but that has been found useful in describing a range of practical cases-may describe a central potential, a peri- odic potential, a square well and others. What is described by the new descrip- tions is not so much more concrete as more specific, in the way that intellectual work, domestic work, gardening, and physical labor, are all still abstract but more specific than work. 2.2. The Argument for the Limitation Claim. Having reviewed the frame- work, the discussion can turn to the larger argument for the Limitation Claim. On page 194-5 Cartwright offers "... a review of my overall argument." It begins by telling readers that "[w]e are invited to believe in the truth of our favourite explanatory theories because of their precision and their empirical successes. The BCS account of superconductivity must be a paradigmatic case." She follows with a description of some of BCS's successes and then by the comment that "Theory, as we generally reconstruct it, leaves out most of what we need to produce a genuine empirical prediction." She ends the "review" of her argument by reiterating the claim that BP/IMs function to supply the more concrete descriptions needed to apply the abstract quantum Hamiltonian. Read- ers are left to reconstruct the argument for the Limitation Claim for themselves. Here is the present reviewer's effort to reconstruct the argument by present- ing it in terms of his own formulation of several premises, each explicitly dis- cussed by Cartwright or clearly needed to support the Limitation Claim as the final conclusion. Cartwright starts from The Concretization Premise: To apply a theory, BP/IMs are required to make the abstract concrete.</page><page sequence="12">710 NOUS The foregoing discussion has already examined this premise at length. The next step cites The Small Stock Premise: The needed concretization is accomplished by a small stock of BP/IMs. But to get from this to the Limitation Claim Cartwright still needs The (BP/IMs Provide) Boundaries Premise: "... the bridge principles pro- vide natural boundaries on the domain the theory can command." (188) Even the Boundaries Premise is not enough, however, as the boundaries set might be so generously wide as to set no substantive limitations. Cartwright also needs The Serious Limits Premise: The boundaries established according to the Boundaries Premise are seriously circumscribed. The content of the Serious Limits Premise is, of course, explicitly included in the statement of the Limitation Claim. But the Serious Limits Premise is nowhere independently stated nor directly nor indirectly argued. Cartwright does state and claim to argue for the Small Stock and the Boundaries Prem- ises: For example, on 209 she writes: "... if we wish to represent a situation within quantum theory... we must construct our models from the small stock of features that quantum theory can treat in a principled way. And this will fix the extent of our theory." (See also, e.g., lower on 209 and 195-6) However Cartwright provides no argument for either the Small Stock or the Boundaries premises. On 198 she says that "The BCS Hamiltonian... is a star- tling confirmation of my claim that the Hamiltonians we use to treat unfamil- iar problems are the stock Hamiltonians associated with familiar models." At most Cartwright's discussion of the BCS Hamiltonian could show that in just one case the set stock suffices to describe certain sorts of (still extremely abstractly described) phenomena. However, what is accomplished with one stock of BP/IMs in just one case shows nothing about limits on what might be done with the stock in application to other problems. This would be like arguing from an example in which one used a computer to do one's income taxes to some general limitations on what else one might be able to use a com- puter for. In short, the examination of the BCS Hamiltonian provides no sup- port for the Boundaries Premise. Nor does examination of which BP/IMs are used in one case study show anything about what other BP/IMs might be included in a sensible reconstruction of the theory as it is used in other appli- cations. That is, the case study provides no support for the Small Stock Premise. Readers will be challenged to find any further argument for either the Small Stock or the Boundaries premises. In particular, for the reasons just given, the</page><page sequence="13">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 711 extended discussion of the BCS Hamiltonian, extending for 12 of the chap- ter's 31 pages, would appear to be completely beside the point of the Bound- aries premise and could at best illustrate the Small Stock premise. In addition, both these premises seem clearly wrong, and are shown wrong on the basis of material that Cartwright herself amply provides in this chap- ter. The exposition of BCS includes many new BP/IMs-the present reviewer counted 23, though there is room for discussion of how these should be indi- viduated. Some of these new BP/IMs are described as "fundamental", "very basic" and "heavily used". (204) In passing, on 195, 203 and 204, Cartwright describes some BP/IMs as derivative as opposed to basic. So presumably the idea that ultimately the domain of the theory is determined by a small stock of BP/IMs turns on the idea that one starts with a small stock of basic BP/IMs and then uses these to extract "derived" BP/IMs. Cartwright never explicitly discusses the mentioned derived/basic distinction, which is clearly vital to the overall view. But the examples she presents make it clear that the idea will apply only if "derived BP/IM" is understood in an extraordinarily loose sense of "derived". One sees in the discussion of BCS that in formulating the derived BP/IMs the treatment uses a great deal of specific information about the situ- ations modeled, information extending far beyond the "basic" BP/IMs, such as the assumption of a periodic lattice. (197) The treatment also makes use of customary but extreme idealizations such as periodic boundary conditions (201) and restriction to nearest neighbor interactions in the lattice. (204) (The present reviewer counted 31 idealizations mentioned in the exposition, though again there are questions of individuation.) Anything that works will be acceptable: "The BCS Hamiltonian is not assigned in as principled a way as I may seem to be suggesting though." (199) Again, on 200: "Thus in the end the BCS Ham- iltonian is a rich illustration: it is a Hamiltonian at once both theoretically prin- cipled and phenomenological or ad hoc." This is a far cry from the claimed principled application of a small stock of BP/IMs. These considerations suggest that there is no well-motivated or useful "basic/ derivative" distinction among the BP/IMs. And given the latitude with which the BP/IMs can be applied and extended, it is very hard to see them as play- ing much of a role in constraining the domain of a theory, much less making the domain seriously restricted. In fact Cartwright herself draws essentially the same negative conclusions about the Small Stock and Boundaries premises. First, on 196 she reiterates the still unargued two assumptions: In so far as we are concerned with theories that are warranted by their empirical successes, the bridge principles of the theory will provide us with an explicit char- acterisation of its scope.... Sticking to Messiah's catalogue of interpretative mod- els as an example, that means that quantum theory extends to all and only those situations that can be represented as composed of central potentials, scattering events, Coulomb interactions and harmonic oscillators. (196) [emphasis added]</page><page sequence="14">712 NO US But immediately below, the Small Stock Premise is retracted: So far I have mentioned four basic bridge principles from Messiah. We may expect more to be added as we move through the theory net from fundamental quantum theory to more specific theories for specific topics. (196) Then, after saying that "[i]n the next section I want to back up my claim that this [the referent of 'this' is not clear] is how quantum theory works by look- ing at a case in detail," she mentions that her showcase example of BCS requires the Block Hamiltonian, which she describes as "new". (all on 196) On 197 she continues with How much of the world altogether can be represented by [the special models that quantum theory supplies] is an open question... My point is that with each new case it is an empirical question whether these models, or models from some other theory, or no models from any theory at all will fit. (197) Other material in the chapter likewise undermines the Small Stock and Boundaries premises. As the extended treatment of BCS makes clear, how far the initial set stock of BP/IMs can be stretched depends on ingenuity and on success in combining them with other sources of information. Indeed, back on 181 (see also 10) Cartwright insisted on the point that models require a cooperative effort from many sources of knowledge, for example that what one can get out of a theory like quantum mechanics depends on success in harnessing it with other theories, other sources of information, and pure guesses. Perhaps one might reconstruct the discussion as pointing out that any appli- cation of something like quantum mechanics requires ancillary information, as one sees clearly from the discussion of BCS. Thus taking the proposed tack would yield, strictly speaking, a null domain of application for theories nar- rowly construed. Just as Cartwright says on 181, application is a co-operative effort calling on a wide range of sources.8 Possibly it would be more sensible to conclude that the domain of a theory narrowly conceived is not a very well characterized idea. An argument for such a conclusion might itself provide an attractive argu- ment against fundamentalism. However, it is not an argument that Cartwright herself gives. 3. Laws, Capacities, and Nomological Machines. This review now turns to a less detailed examination of leading ideas in the rest of Dappled. According to Cartwright, laws are rare. They occur only courtesy of, and limited to the confines of, nomological machines. These in turn operate by the orchestration of the capacities of their components. The present section will in turn exam- ine Cartwright's attack on the prior conception of "regularity law", her exposi-</page><page sequence="15">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 713 tion of the idea of a nomological machine, and her exposition of capacities and the way they function in nomological machines. 3.1 Cartwright's Attack on Laws. What does Cartwright have in mind when she attacks laws? Here, by law of nature I mean what has been generally meant by 'law' in the liberalised Humean empiricism of most post-logical-positivist philosophy of science: a law of nature is a necessary regular association between properties ante- cedently regarded as OK.... Empiricists differ about what properties they take to be OK; the usual favourites are sensible properties, measurable properties and occurrent properties. My objections do not depend on which choice is made. (49; see also 4) Cartwright does not address alternative conceptions such as laws as relations among universals or best system accounts. As will become increasingly clear as the examination proceeds, a lot turns on how one understands the limitation to "OK" properties. She has said (quote above) "My objections do not depend on which choice is made." However, in much of her exposition, she focuses on "occurrent" and/or "measurable" prop- erties. For example It is important to the discussion to keep firmly in mind that there is more to the conventional sense of 'law' than regularity: the regularities are supposed to be ones between some especially favoured set of OK properties, say occurrent properties or ones we can measure. (65. See also 59, 73, 140, 137, 138) Much of Cartwright's discussion makes better sense if this restriction is taken in the spirit of an uncritical reading of "direct observation", if only because one is inclined to agree vis-a-vis the properties of everyday life that regulari- ties, where they occur at all, are far from uniform. But making a real restric- tion depends on drawing a viable and relevant distinction between properties that are OK by empiricists' standards and, presumably, the capacities in terms of which her own account is supposed to run. As will emerge, other aspects of the account undermine precisely this distinction. Cartwright's attack on regularity laws depends on excluding appeal to coun- terfactual regularities. If regularity laws could be understood as the regulari- ties that would occur under ideal conditions they would not be nearly as rare or limited as Cartwright claims: "... regularity theorists are apt to defend their view by resorting to counterfactual regularities.., that would obtain if the cir- cumstances were different." (144) Cartwright rejects appeal to counterfactual regularities on the grounds that possible world analyses of counterfactuals are not viable: On the "modalised" version of the regularity account "[a] law of nature of this world-that is, a law of nature full stop, since this is the only</page><page sequence="16">714 NO US world there is-consists in a regularity that obtains nowhere at all." (144) But on 4 Cartwright says that "By 'laws' I mean descriptions of what regularly happens,... where we may, if we wish, allow counterfactual as well as actual regularities...." More importantly, in order to say what she wants to say about capacities and nomological machines she herself needs to say what would occur, counterfactually. (See for example, 145, 147. On 143 Cartwright both appeals to counterfactual regularities and rejects any such appeal. See also 10) To summarize this subsection: The stand has some plausibility when it is taken as rejecting the notion of unlimited regularity among "OK" properties acceptable to narrow empiricists. However, any explicit argument depends cru- cially on her attack on the appeal to counterfactuals, a position which she con- tradicts both explicitly and in her own usage. More broadly, it is not really clear what she means to be attacking because she leaves the range of "OK" properties open. As the exposition will unfold below, it becomes more and more a question of how Cartwright can specify the range of the OK properties in a way that will make her overall position coherent. 3.2 Nomological Machines. Where regularity does occur, Cartwright claims, it is within the narrow confines of a nomological machine, that is a fixed (enough) arrangement of components, or factors, with stable (enough) capacities that in the right sort of stable (enough) environment will, with repeated operation, give rise to the kind of regular behaviour that we represent in our scien- tific laws. (50; see also 49, 73, 77, 124, 134, 145 ff. 151, 173, 187) A nomological machine is a "special arrangement" of parts the capacities of which are thereby orchestrated to produce regularities. (57; also 50, 52, 73, 151, 176) While not providing further analysis of the concept, Cartwright does pro- vide many, many examples, including many from both physics and econom- ics. Some are mentioned in passing (e.g., the planetary system (49), batteries (29, 47) SQUIDS (5, 24, 29, 47), fiber optics cables (30), a money multiplier (142-3), the International Monetary Fund (150); and some in considerable detail-e.g., the quantum gravity probe (85-93) and several cases from eco- nomics (e.g., 145 ff., 152w ff., 168 ff.). These do accomplish a lot by way of setting out Cartwright's intuitive idea. And they well illustrate Cartwright's broadest theme-that theoretical accounts in science do not generally proceed by calculation from first principles but by carefully constructed descriptions, usually highly circumscribed as to scope and to some extent as to accuracy. Throughout the book Cartwright insists on the requirement that the opera- tion of nomological machines must be set up so that their proper operation is not disturbed by interfering factors (See 51, 52-3, 57, 67, 143, 147, 151) and that they must be shielded. (See 29, 47, 50, 51, 52-3, 57, 67, 143, 147, 151) Since Cartwright provides no independent account of or argument for shield-</page><page sequence="17">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 715 ing we should take talk of shielding as a terminological variant for the require- ment of insuring no interfering factors. The examples of shielding involving gravity (51, 52-3, 57) are puzzling because, of course, gravity cannot be shielded. In fact, it is at best controversial whether any force can really be shielded other than by insuring that it is counteracted. Cartwright repeatedly insists that theories and laws are severely limited in their scope and that disorder predominates in the world. (1, 9, 10, 12, 59, 65, 121, 122) Science gives only a patchwork of laws. (1, 13, 31, 34) There are no laws or regularities without a nomological machine to generate them (1, 4, 49, 50, 51, 57, 58, 59, 73, 77, 86, 89, 148) and, for the most part, no nomolog- ical machines except where contrived by human beings. (1, 2, 10, 12, 46, 47, 49, 59, 86, 89, 121, 122, 124, 139, 142, 143, 148) Since there is no objective measure of the degree to which the world naturally exhibits regularity many readers are going to see a lot more naturally occurring regularity in the world than Cartwright does: Reliably salt dissolves, on sunny days the sky is blue, ocean waves break on the shore, water evaporates and freezes, ice floats, and unsupported objects near the surface of the earth fall. (23) It is particularly puzzling that Cartwright nowhere considers biological examples. Given her intuitive sketch of the conception of a nomological machine one must include every organism, indeed, every cell of every organism as a nomological machine; and these exhibit not only biological regularities, but many physical and count- less chemical ones as well. Readers may also be left less than fully clear on the relation between the ideas of a nomological machine and a ceteris paribus law. For example, Laws, where they do apply, hold only ceteris paribus.... Laws hold as a conse- quence of the repeated, successful operation of what, I shall argue, is reasonably thought of as a nomological machine. (4; see also 10, 25, 28-9, 33, 50, 57, 139, 147-8, 151, 168, 175-6, 188) Clearly these conceptions are closely connected, but Cartwright never makes clear what difference there is, if any, in the work done. 3.3 Capacities. Cartwright clearly intends the lion's share of the work of the concept of a nomological machine to be carried by her conception of capacities-for example she devotes 17 out of the 24 pages of chapter 3, "Nom- ological machines and the laws they produce" to the discussion of capacities. It will be useful to begin with a brief review of what she says about capac- ities in her (1989). The first sentence of that book reads: Science is measurement; capacities can be measured; and science cannot be under- stood without them. (1989: 1) More specifically, capacities are real and cannot be "modalized away". (1989: 158-170, 181) Capacities measure up to the most stringent of sensible empiri-</page><page sequence="18">716 NO US cists' demands "that each quantity be measured and each claim be tested." (1989: 167; also, e.g., 180) (Descriptions of) capacities are abstract (descrip- tions). (1989: 228) This is because to describe a capacity one strips away in imagination in an Aristotelian spirit (1989: 197) the factors that interfere with the capacity's manifestation. (1989: 175, 187-8, 194, 197, 204, 206, 213, and chapter 5 passim.) Capacities come before laws in the sense that "[t]he generic causal claims of science are not reports of regularities but rather ascriptions of capacities, capacities to make things happen, case by case." (1989: 2-3) Con- trary to Hume, and Mill in some moods, "... laws are not uniformities or regu- larities in nature..." Instead she endorses what she takes to be Mill's better view that "... the fundamental laws of nature are laws that assign stable tenden- cies to specific causes" (1989: 179), where capacities "... are tendencies to cause or to bring about something." (1989: 226) At (1989: 181-2) Cartwright expresses views which will be discussed in more detail in Dappled: "... laws of association are in fact quite uncommon in nature, and should not be seen as fundamental to how it operates." And: "It is not the laws that are fundamental, but rather the capacities." Dappled appears to be an effort to carry out the program set, for example at (1989: 8, 229) to do away with laws in favor of capacities. In Dappled Cartwright is clear that she thinks capacities to be of central importance to her topic. Much is summarized by saying that "[M]ore basic [than knowledge of regularity laws] is knowledge about capacities...." (77; see also 4, 10, 17, 49, 59, 64-7, 77, 84, 89, 90, 138, 143, 176) Knowledge of capacities and of how capacities can be made to work together is central to the construction, understanding, and description of the behavior of nomologi- cal machines: It is capacities that are basic, and laws of nature obtain-to the extent that they do obtain-on account of the capacities; or more explicitly, on account of the repeated operation of a system of components with stable capacities in particu- larly fortunate circumstances.... [I]t takes what I call a nomological machine to get a law of nature. (49; see also 59, 77) Reference to capacities is needed to formulate "principles for building nomo- logical machines" (64-66) and to describe how nomological machines run (67), that is, how capacities work together. (53, 54-5, 57, 64-67, 83, 86, 142, 143) In addition Cartwright claims that reference to capacities functions crucially in making sense of scientific method (85 ff.), in particular to express what gen- eralization one is testing in an experiment (90) and to make sense of induc- tion from a single case (85 ff.). It is a central claim of chapter 4 that one can not do without a concept of capacities or natures in sorting out complex inter- actions. (Cartwright uses "capacities" and "natures" in many respects interchangeably-see 84-5.) In general Cartwright claims that only appeal to capacities can accomplish these objectives. The problem is that readers will have a great deal of diffi-</page><page sequence="19">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 717 culty determining from the text how she thinks such appeals get these jobs done. In turn a major source of this difficulty is that she never gives as good a description of capacities as she did in (1989), nor does she anywhere state whether or in what way the exposition in Dappled departs from, refines, or extends the former exposition. In particular in Dappled the relation between capacities and abstraction is left problematically unclear. The exposition of capacities in Dappled includes examples: "Coulomb's law describes a capacity that a body has qua charged." (53) "The capacities of the components of a circuit-resistors, capacitors, inductances, and impedances- are represented in well-known formulae." (54) And, "Taxes have the capacity to affect prices." (60) She tells readers that knowledge of natures "... tell[s] us what can happen, not what will happen... " (10) and that capacities involve "ten- dencies" or "trying" to produce the manifestations with which one associates the capacity. (28-9, 66) In chapter 6 Cartwright suggests that appeal to capacities will work to solve the standard puzzle about ceteris paribus laws: that to say that all As are Bs, ceteris paribus, would appear to say that all As are Bs except when "some- thing goes wrong", which in turn appears to say no more than all As are Bs except for the ones that are not. Cartwright suggests that On the natures picture there is a general and principled distinction between the descriptions that belong inside a [ceteris paribus] law statement and those that should remain outside as a condition for the regularity described in the law to obtain. (139, see also 143, 148) For this suggestion to work Cartwright would have to provide reasons why, as she insists (143, 148) ceteris paribus conditions cannot be absorbed as fur- ther conditions that are an explicit part of the law itself, as opposed to condi- tions "governing" the law as a whole. In particular, to accomplish the last objective there would have to be a relevant principled distinction between capacities and the OK properties that are the proper subjects of regularity laws. As will transpire below, Cartwright herself appears to give up any such rele- vant distinction. For Cartwright, "[w]hat is important about capacities is their open- endedness...." (59) In this respect Cartwright contrasts capacities with dispositions: Disposition terms, as they are usually understood, are tied one-to-one to law-like regularities. But capacities, as I use the term, are not restricted to any single kind of manifestation. Objects with a given capacity can behave very differently in dif- ferent circumstances. (59; see also 60, 64) As illustrations she cites a charged object subject to Coulomb's law and the capacity of taxes to affect prices (59-64). However the claimed contrast with</page><page sequence="20">718 NO US "one track" dispositions does no work for her, because most if not all disposi- tions have the kind of multiple manifestation and flexible exemplification that she claims differentiates capacities from ordinary dispositions. Flammability is as easily and as variously counteracted as the Coulomb force. The water solubility of salt is at the same time a capacity to increase conductivity and specific density of water, to turn water into an electrolyte, to affect taste and optical properties, to name a few. Consider the variability of what is in ques- tion in applying "fragile" to a glass, a chair, or a state of peace. Since the attempted contrast with ordinary dispositions does no work, how should readers understand Cartwright's claim that capacities are "open-ended" and the work that this open-endedness is supposed to accomplish in the analy- sis? At 28 Cartwright characterizes capacities (there referred to as natures) in terms of "trying": "It is in the nature of a force to produce an acceleration.... even when other causes are at work, it will 'try' to do so." And, In general what counts as 'trying' will differ from one kind of cause to another. To ascribe a behavior to the nature of a feature is to claim that the behaviour is exportable beyond the strict confines of the ceteris paribus conditions, although usually only as a 'tendency' or a 'trying'. (28-29; see also 66) How are these 'tryings' to be understood? Reference to the fact that one force can be counteracted by applying another will not get at what she has in mind. In understanding Cartwright's attitude towards capacities, and her anti- fundamentalism generally, a great deal turns on the following example, quoted from Neurath: In some cases a physicist is a worse prophet than a [behaviourist psychologist], as when he is supposed to specify where in Saint Stephen's Square a thousand dollar bill swept away by the wind will land, whereas a [behaviourist] can spec- ify the result of a conditioning experiment rather accurately. (27) Fundamentalists will claim that the motion of the bill can be given, at least in principle, by specifying the total force on the bill at each moment. However, that assumes that only forces can affect the motion. Apparently Cartwright's position is that one would be justified in such a claim only by building a model specifying such forces or at least by having a reasonable expectation of being able to do so. In cases like the bill blown about by the wind the possibility of building such a model is so hopelessly beyond anything one could hope to accomplish that "... the assumption [of existence of such forces] is another expression of fundamentalist faith." (28) Instead one must conclude that there are causes of motion other than forces (28; see also 32-3, 67) such as the desires of people located in Saint Stephen's Square. Do these desires not them- selves supervene on what would be specified in terms of a complete account in terms of forces? Cartwright dismisses such supervenience as unargued, as</page><page sequence="21">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 719 again no more than a question begging reiteration of the fundmamentalist faith. (32-3) Cartwright's interpretation of this example plays a large role in her expo- sition. She repeatedly refers to the fact that from knowledge of one force, nothing follows about an object's motion. (e.g., 59-60, 65, 67, 71, 82) Funda- mentalists will say that, of course, one needs the total force. Thus Cartwright's interpretation of the example of the bill in Saint Stephen's Square is crucial in moving beyond the "fundamentalists' faith" that all can be computed, at least in principle, by application of fundamental theory to exact descriptions. In simply asserting the non-existence of a total force that determines the motion Cartwright appears to be begging the question against fundamental- ists. One might see her insistence as supported by empiricist principles: "... I am an empiricist. I know no guide to principle except successful practice" (2; see also 5, 9, 11, 24) However, this would appear to be an implausible appli- cation of the kind of empiricism that Cartwright endorses. Empiricism, of the kind here in question, recommends limiting what one takes to exist to the kinds of things of which one can become knowledgeable. For Cartwright this goes far beyond brute perception: She maintains that capacities can be measured and that, consequently, one should take them to be real. To then limit what specific capacities are operative in a specific situation to the ones that people have succeeded in explicitly measuring or modeling would, given the severity of human limitations, constitute an extreme sort of anthropomorphism of meta- physics. (See also 47-8 for the kind of argument I am here criticizing.) In short, the claimed open-endedness of capacities and the role that the open- endedness plays in the discussion turns on an interpretation of one (easily multi- plied) example that critics may fairly say begs the question. A second worry about the claimed open-endedness of capacities and its role in the analysis arises when one asks: If capacities are essentially open ended, how do theories work to provide knowledge of capacities and knowl- edge of how capacities interact in nomological machines to produce reliable and regular behavior? Cartwright addresses this question by saying that the exact sciences describe capacities that admit of exact quantifiable description. (54; see also 24, 65, 66-7, 90) Also, the exact sciences provide rules of com- bination: In ... the project we undertake in theory formation... [w]e must develop on the one hand concepts... and on the other, rules for combination... When the concepts are instantiated in the arrangements covered by the rules, the rules must tell us what happens, where regularity is built into the demand for a rule: whenever the arrange- ment is thus-and-so, what happens is what the rule says should happen. (56, empha- sis in the original; see also 53, 54, 55, 77, 90) Cartwright summarizes her approach to the issue by saying that the exact sci- ences work by the "analytic method". (83, 93, 150, 151; see also 67, 124, 138, 176)</page><page sequence="22">720 NOUS However, the claim that the exact sciences work in terms of the analytic method immediately suggests that the laws or principles that the exact sci- ences apply across specific applications themselves describe regularities apply- ing to capacities. Cartwright insists that no such reconstruction works: We may ask, though, 'Are not the laws for describing the capacities themselves just further regularity statements?' But we know from chapters 3 and 4 that the answer to this is 'no'. (142, see also 49-50, 52, 77-8, 138, 143, 148, 149) This claim, in addition to appearing to contradict the quote from 56 just above, leaves the overall analysis in difficult straits: Cartwright provides readers with no mode of operation for the analytic method alternative to laws or principles of theories understood as regularities holding among capacities. In addition to the quotation from 56 above, in a number of other places Cartwright acknowl- edges the need for laws, citing laws holding among "natures" (used interchange- ably with "capacities"-again see 84-5) with approval: "... laws in the form I commend-that is, laws about natures...." (87; see also, 54, 89-90) A closely related tension emerges in consideration of the status of capaci- ties. As explained, the case against regularities depends for whatever force it has on taking a narrow view of the OK properties. Thus, on the one hand, capacities, the subject of exact description by the exact sciences, should not themselves be eligible to serve as OK properties in general regularity law statements. But, on the other hand the need of the exact sciences to have some- thing exact to talk about forces Cartwright to acknowledge capacities them- selves as OK, occurrent, measurable properties: ... what we have done [in reaction to Scholasticism] is to replace occult powers by powers that are visible, though it may take a very fancy experiment to see them. (80; similarly on 141) In responding to anticipated objections from Fine and van Fraassen, Cart- wright depicts them as objecting that her judgements about the reliable behav- ior of nomological machines "... must ultimately be based not in facts about capacities, which you [Cartwright] cannot observe, but in facts about actual behaviour, which you can." (68) Cartwright retorts: "But what about this decon- taminated data base? Where is it in our experience? It is a philosophical con- struction, a piece of metaphysics... " (68) And: "My experiences are of people and houses and pinchings and aspirins, all things which I understand, in large part, in terms of their capacities." (69) The discussion 68-9 pretty clearly aban- dons any relevant distinction between capacities and other kinds of proper- ties. This attitude is stated explicitly four pages later: Once we have forsaken the impressions-and-ideas theory of concept formation defended by Hume and all forms of sense-data theories as well, how are we to</page><page sequence="23">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 721 draw a distinction between facts about occurrent properties and ones about capac- ities in the first place? I have no qualms about giving up the distinction. [73; but see also pp. 52 and 65 which appear explicitly to reject capacities as occurrent properties.] In summary, to countenance the robust attitude towards capacities that she recommends Cartwright is forced to recognize them as OK properties. How- ever, as OK properties readers no longer have any reason not to see them as the subject of perfectly general lawlike regularities. Indeed, Cartwright would appear to need these regularities to give substance to the "analytic method", to describe how capacities interact, how they may be combined in fashioning new nomological machines, and in describing the detailed behavior of nomo- logical machines once fabricated. Or at least Cartwright has not given any alter- native suggestion about how the analytic method is supposed to work.9 4. Nomological Machines and Mechanisms. So far this review has detailed a wide range of difficulties with Cartwright's views as she has presented them in Dappled. However, the network of ideas of capacities, nomological machines, and limited regularity might nonetheless present an attractive package or pic- ture. This section will drop worries about the details and examine the ques- tion of whether the network of ideas nonetheless provides a useful fresh start on questions about how theories function to describe the world. If capacities are real, they should count as OK properties, as at least suit- able candidates for regularity. However, if they are to provide a distinctive role in the analysis they must also be differentiated from other properties. Although Cartwright has not provided a viable analysis that distinguishes capacities from other properties, readers will have a preanalytic grasp, sufficient for present purposes, of what she has in mind. This informal understanding of capacities and their anticipated special role may be marked by calling capacities the spe- cial properties. These special properties are perfectly respectable, but they differ from the ones that might be called the ordinary properties, the ones Cart- wright appears to have in mind in reference to "occurrent", "observable", "man- ifest", and (at least sometimes) "measurable" properties. The distinction between the special and ordinary properties may then be used to make a correlative distinction among laws. The present reconstruction will allow that generalizations that interrelate the special properties may constitute bone fide laws. As mentioned, Cartwright appears to allow these in (54, 56, 87, 89-90. See also 1989: 148, 160, 169-70, 179) And she appears to need these to have any hope of making out the notion of the exact sciences' "analytic method". By way of contrast, the present reconstruction will use regularity laws to refer to generalizations among the ordinary properties. These are now more plausibly held always to have limited application, to be subject to exceptions, and more generally to fit Cartwright's description of a "patchwork of laws". This way of thinking about "regularity laws" may correspond to Cartwright's</page><page sequence="24">722 NOUS notion in her 1983 of phenomenological laws, a comparison which might help to clarify the current set of ideas. (1983; 1-4, 19, 100 ff.) The program then suggests nomological machines as a useful new metaphor for helping one to understand the bearing of concrete material arrangements on limitations of reg- ularity laws and the ways in which regularity laws arise. To test the material in this form it is useful to ask whether there are anteced- ents. As soon as this question is posed, the notion of a mechanism comes to mind and with it the question: How does the broad and open ended notion of a nomological machine differ from the broad and open ended traditional notion of a mechanism? Nowhere does Cartwright comment on this comparison. At this point critics may be inclined to drop nomological machines as old wine in a new bottle. However, before rejecting the metaphor as uninteresting for this reason one must examine the question of whether the glass of the new bottle enables one to get an improved view of the contents. One needs to exam- ine the claim that the metaphor of a nomological machine aids in understand- ing the status of regularity laws, their infrequency, how they arise, and why they involve ceteris paribus conditions. In turn the new question suggests asking how, antecedently, one under- stood the connections between regularity laws and mechanisms. In fact there would appear to be an attitude, widespread and familiar if questionable, that bears directly on the issue. Whenever someone notices a regularity correspond- ing to a regularity law many are inclined to ask: What is the mechanism that explains the observed regularity? The attitude really incorporates two parts: i) The functioning of a mechanism gives rise to a regularity describable by a regularity law and ii) Whenever there is a regularity (describable by a regularity law) there is an underlying mechanism that gives rise to it, as described in i). If one identifies nomological machines with mechanisms, i) and ii) summa- rize exactly the conceptual work that Cartwright assigns to nomological machines. That is, nomological machines are responsible for the "pockets" of regularity to be found in the world. This is just i). And taking the contraposi- tive of ii) immediately gives Cartwright's view that where there is no nomolog- ical machine there are no regularities described by any regularity law.o1 It might be hasty to conclude from these considerations that there is noth- ing in Cartwright's metaphor of nomological machines not already covered by at least some common ways of thinking about mechanisms. Nevertheless, the considerations do make it a fair question: What is the relation of the concep- tion of nomological machines to prior conceptions of mechanisms, and in par- ticular, what does the new conception add not already covered by the former?</page><page sequence="25">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 723 5. Two Examples of Further Ideas in Dappled. Putting aside the issue of nomological machines, Dappled presents other ideas worth consideration. For example chapter 7 argues for the need to restrict attribution of objective prob- abilities to situations characterizable in terms of chance set-ups. The present reviewer does not see that Cartwright's discussion of chance set-ups adds any- thing to the ground already covered in the very extensive literature by Pop- per, Hacking, Mellor, Giere, and many others. But Cartwright concludes with an intriguing comment: She has argued that "... probabilities are generated by chance set-ups, and their characterisation necessarily refers back to the chance set-up that gives rise to them." She then remarks that "The same, I claim, is true of all our laws, whether we take them to be iron-the typical attitude towards the laws of physics-or of a more flexible material, as in biology, economics or psychology." (175) She does not explicitly examine the pro- posed analogy between the chance set-ups which "generate" probabilities and nomological machines, or mechanisms, which "generate" regularities more broadly. Perhaps this analogy is worth study. In chapter 9 Cartwright advances the idea that quantum and classical mechanics describe different quantities even when these quantities, such as "position" and "momentum", go by the same name in the two theories. (218) She summarizes by writing: Let us grant that quantum mechanics is a correct theory and that its state func- tions provide true descriptions. That does not imply that classical state ascriptions must be false. Both kinds of descriptions can be true at once and of the same sys- tem. (231) How then are the quantum and classical descriptions related? I propose... that the [quantum mechanical] probabilities when they exist at all are probabilities for classical quantities to possess particular values. (216)"1 So, for example, quantum and classical "position" quantities are distinct. This resolves any explicit conflict arising from the fact that in classical but not quan- tum theory position and momentum have simultaneous exact values. The posi- tion quantities in the two theories are different but related by the probability statements. And similarly for two distinct "momentum" quantities. Cartwright's exposition is obscured by writing of "identifying" quantum mechanical and classical quantities (219, 220, 221, 226) but then adding that these are not "a once and for all identification." (228) These difficulties can be sidestepped by saying that the quantities of the two theories are truly differ- ent, but in certain circumstances information about the values of quantities from one theory provides information about the values of quantities from the other theory.</page><page sequence="26">724 NO US 6. Concluding Comments. Readers will differ in the value they place on ideas such as the two described in section 5. However, those who set out to mine for such nuggets are forewarned that they will have to process the sort of sparse ore described in sections 2-4. Proponents, including the present reviewer, of the kind of view which Cartwright has been so instrumental in promoting will be particularly disappointed by Dappled's poor showing12 because of the skep- ticism for the whole program that it is in danger of encouraging among its critics. The program has stimulated a great deal of recent excellent work. The work undertaken in Dappled may also prove profitable if comments such as the present review will be read as a constructive challenge: What more clearly are bridge principles and interpretative models and the relation between them? What determines whether a BP/IM counts as basic or derived? How is one to make sense of the "domain of a theory", given that in virtually every realistic case a theory can be applied only on the basis of information obtained else- where? Just what is the "analytic method"? In particular, does it use laws governing the relations among dispositions and capacities viewed as "OK" properties? What is the relation between regularity and phenomenological laws? Between capacities as treated in Dappled and in (1989)? In particular, how have Cartwright's treatments of these notions evolved or changed? What is the relation between conceptions of mechanisms and nomological machines? Efforts from Cartwright and others to answer such questions will provide valuable contributions to the understanding of science. Notes Thanks to the many, too many to mention individually by name, who have helped me with this project. I am also eager to acknowledge the very extensive comments on a previous draft of this review from Professor Cartwright which called attention to several egregious errors on my own part, giving me the opportunity to correct them before going to print. As always, the author takes full responsibility for any errors remaining. 2 All page numbers without date are to Dappled (1999) 3 See Teller (2001a) for a survey. 4 It must be acknowledged that chapter 8 is the most problematic in the book, which would have made it an inappropriate choice for detailed examination in the work of a less prominent scholar. The present reviewer has nonetheless chosen to put the details of chapter 8 on display because it offers an argument central to the book that is largely located in one chapter and because it offers a relatively concise exhibit of the difficulties which readers will find in large measure throughout the book. 5 'The Limitation Claim' is the reviewer's nomenclature, not Cartwright's. 6 Cartwright treated this sort of issue much more carefully in her (1989)-see sections 5.5 and 204-206. Many other places in Dappled suffer from failure clearly to distinguish between abstract models and the concrete, real world systems that the models represent, or between descrip- tions that are abstract in having no specific referent and descriptions that have intended specific real world referents. See, e.g., 124 ff., 143 ff., 168 ff. and 229. 7 See Auyang (1999) for a wonderful survey of this kind of strategy in physics and other sciences. 8 This point is also made in some detail in specific cases in Teller (2001b, section 7)</page><page sequence="27">Nancy Cartwright's The Dappled World 725 9 There are also potential difficulties about how to reconcile any joint claim that capacities are both OK properties and given by abstract descriptions (e.g., "The term 'force'... is an abstract term... that describes the capacity of one body to move another towards it... " (52) with the claim in chapter 2 that an abstract description such as that of the concept of force does not specify "... a new, separate property, different from any of the arrangements which exhibit it."(44. See chapter 2 passim.) This is a serious difficulty if Cartwright means to stick by her account of the connec- tion between capacities and abstract descriptions given in her (1989). But the account of the rela- tion between capacities and abstract descriptions in Dappled is so non-specific that it is hard to see to what Cartwright is and is not committed in these respects. 10 See Glennan (1996) for a statement similar to the one of this section on mechanisms and their relation to laws. In making the comparison, read Glennan's "direct causal laws", also his "fundamental laws" as this section's "bone fide laws". Glennan's M, p. 52, corresponds to Cart- wright's characterization of nomological machines. This section's i) and ii) then correspond to Glennan's claim "that all laws are either mechanically explicable or fundamental." (1996: 61) See also Glennan's (1997) for a discussion of Cartwright's (1989) work on capacities, his own discus- sion of capacities and laws, and especially a very useful contrast between fundamental vs. struc- tural or mechanically explicable capacities. Another contemporary source for comparison of Cartwright's notion of a nomological machine and the traditional idea of a mechanism is Machamer, Darden and Craver's (2000). Comparison will be facilitated by taking Machamer et. al. to use 'properties that enable activities' in ways similar to Cartwright's use of 'capacities' and taking them to use 'phenomenon' for what occurs reliably as described by what I am here calling a 'regularity law'. " There is no mention of the fact that Bohr understood the probabilities provided by quan- tum mechanics in just this way, although he did not think of quantum mechanics as describing idiosyncratic and distinct properties. See Teller (1981). 12 Readers will also be disappointed by the poor showing by Cambridge University Press. From the incorrect starting page number for chapter 3 in the table of contents, through the botched fig- ure on page 164, from the numerous missing and run-on words and other typographical errors through the sometimes marginally and occasionally completely ungrammatical wording which one would have thought would have been corrected in copy editing, the book was poorly produced.
