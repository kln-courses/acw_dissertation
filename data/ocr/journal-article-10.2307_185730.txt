<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF PHYSICAL REALITY' W. H. WERKMEISTER In his recently published book, The Nature of Physical Reality (5), Professor Margenau develops a conception of physical reality, which, on the one hand, is a repudiation of radical empiricism (5: 28) and which, on the other hand, is a denial of realism (5: 47). Margenau believes that he has accomplished his task by means of "constructs" which, in "a large area of discourse," are "wholly synonymous" with concepts and which, nevertheless, when verified, are "the external objects" (5: 70-71; 296). It is my opinion that Margenau's thesis encounters insurmountable difficulties. However, since I have dealt with some of these difficulties elsewhere (9), I shall at present refrain from further criticism and shall instead re-examine the prob- lem for which Margenau hoped to provide a solution and attempt an alternative interpretation. 1. Preliminary Considerations. If, as Margenau maintains, "there is not a tree and my construct of it"; if, on the contrary, "the tree is the construct" (5: 70) as also "the electron, as an external object,2 is the construct" (5: 71); and if, fur- thermore, trees and electrons and molecules and flowers are "compounded from sense impressions, past and present," and certain "rational elements" (5: 71);- then we may well ask, are the trees, the flowers, the molecules, and the electrons we talk about ideational complexes whose being is their being perceived and/or thought, or are they in some important sense real things or entities which may be said to exist irrespective of their being perceived and/or thought? It is this ques- tion, I believe, which constitutes the problem of reality or which, if it is not the whole of the problem, indicates at least one of its basic aspects. I realize that my way of stating the problem will be regarded as obsolete and misleading by a number of contemporary thinkers; for have we not been told again and again that philosophy, being logical analysis, is concerned with the clarification and systemic construction of an accurate and adequate language rather than with an interpretation of objects, things, or situations? (2: 435) I do not mean to belittle the logico-linguistic results obtained in language analy- sis and in formalized linguistic reconstructions, but I do feel that philosophy is more than logical analysis and that the problem of physical reality, in particular, is not a problem of language (formalized or otherwise) alone (8). As a matter of fact, the problem of physical reality arises because, as cues for behavioral responses, some objects of experience are "unreliable," "misleading," and "elusive" in a way which seems to set them apart as "not real." It is in the practical affairs of living that we first learn to distinguish the "substance" from the "shadow," the "real thing" from an "illusion," the "actual furnishing in a room" from their "images in a mirror." Even an animal can and does make these distinctions. At the linguistic level the problem is merely one of fixating 1 A paper read on March 15, 1951 before the Philosophy Club of Harvard University. 2 My italics. 214</page><page sequence="2">THE PROBLEM OF PHYSICAL REALITY 215 as sharply as possible the "felt" differences just indicated and of formulating criteria which will enable us in all cases to separate the "real" from the "non- real." Our linguistic distinctions must follow the experiential pattern, must re- veal it more clearly and must bring it to a fuller comprehension; but the pattern itself is indicated, if only fragmentarily, in the "givens" of pre-linguistic ex- perience. There is, however, another aspect of the problem, for the separation of the "real" from the "unreal" may not in itself tell us anything about the nature of the "real." More specifically, it may tell us nothing about physical reality or whether or not "physical" reality can be distinguished from reality of some other type. Here, too, a purely linguistic analysis is not sufficient because the distinc- tions referred to are at least suggested, if they are not more strongly indicated, by the facts of experience, and language is but a tool facilitating the interpreta- tion. In all significant analyses we must return to and must safeguard the phe- nomena.' One further point, I believe, should be made clear before we come to grips with the problem of physical reality itself; it is this: Linguistic constructions of the type first attempted by Carnap in his Aufbau (1: 4) are conceived in a manner which differs in at least one essential respect from the formulation of scientific hypotheses and do not provide a solution of the problem in question. In the Aufbau-procedure-be it carried through in terms of a phenomenalistic language or in terms of a physicalistic language-we obtain complex sentences by compounding elementary sentences which are presumed to be directly de- scriptive of specified aspects of experience (such as sense-data or the "physical correlates" of sense-data). In the case of scientific hypotheses, on the other hand, statements directly descriptive of the interrelations of sense-data or their "phys- ical correlates" are to be explained by deriving them from stipulated conditions which, though perfectly clear to our understanding, are either not directly ob- servable (e.g., the explanation of pressure in terms of the kinetic theory of gases), or are entirely beyond observation (e.g., the explanation of the interrelations of spectral lines in terms of Bohr's now classical theory of sub-atomic structures). Aufbau-procedure and theory construction in science do not aim in the same direction.4 Moreover, if the Aufbau-procedure employs phenomenalistic language, it cannot accommodate physical reality without becoming inconsistent, and if it employs physicalistic language, it assumes rather than furnishes the solution. In either case, Aufbau-procedure does not help us with our problem. 8 A radical behaviorism, denying as it must all intrasubjective phenomena of conscious- ness, stands refuted by the impossibility of a complete behavioristic interpretation of one's own meaningful assertion of the behavioristic thesis. That is to say, not all phenomena of experience can be forced into the schema of a behavioristic language. 4 I regard as futile any attempt to develop an Aufbau-system as the basic structure to which all scientific theories which are to be philosophically acceptable must be reducible (as logic is a structure to which certain branches of mathematics can be reduced); for the development of scientific theories is an interpretation of experience and a systemic inte- gration of all descriptive sentences relevant to a given field.</page><page sequence="3">216 W. H. WERKMEISTER 2. Types of Terms in Natural Science. In our most advanced natural sciences we encounter at least four more or less distinct types of terms. They signify (1) things, (2) sense-data, (3) ideal objects, and (4) constructs. When we analyze the meanings of these types of terms we discover a peculiar interrelation of the terms and of the experiential phenomena involved-an interrelation which, though it may not in itself solve the problem of physical reality, will at least bring it into clearer focus. When the physicist speaks of spectroscopes, Geiger counters, pressure gauges, or some other piece of laboratory equipment or apparatus, he speaks of "things" in the same naively realistic fashion in which the proverbial man-in-the-street speaks of tables and trees and automobiles. In other words, he speaks of "things" which, presumably, exist "out there" in complete independence of their being observed or known. For the time being we shall let it go at that. Terms signifying sense-data pertain, of course, to qualia which are seen, heard, tasted, kinesthetically felt, or experienced in a similar manner. At a first level of interpretation the physicist uses these terms in just that sense. At another level of interpretation, however, he finds greater order, i.e., greater conformity with law, in the realm of phenomena if he supplements the directly observed qualia with "physical correlates," such as "waves" of determinable types and wave lengths, and de-anthropomorphized "forces," which permit exact quanti- tative interpretation. The question now is, What, precisely, is the existential status of the "physical correlates"? The answer to this question seems to be clear. In the case of the "electromagnetic waves," for example, which are the "physi- cal correlates" of the experienced color qualia, the pattern of decreasing wave lengths is not only isomorphic with a sequence of color qualia determined by the "rainbow sequence" of matched colors but connects the visible spectrum with an invisible spectrum which includes radio waves, X-rays, and gamma-rays, and which thus links together a very large number of highly diversified phenomena. Throughout the whole range of the phenomena in question changes occur in certain "things" (marks on photographic films, reactions of radio tubes, etc.) which can readily be understood on the assumption that the electromagnetic waves are as "real" as are the "things" they act upon. However, the situation becomes less clear when we take into consideration-as we must if we are to account for all relevant phenomena-photoelectric and Compton effects and the reaction of Geiger counters to gamma-rays; for these phenomena find a satis- factory explanation only if we assume that light consists not of waves but of "particles" of energy hv, the "photons," which collide with particles of "matter." We may still assert that the "physical correlates" of the observed color qualia are as "real" as are tables and trees and houses, but can we still say that they are "waves" or that they are "particles"? They seem to have characteristic aspects of both. Or is this but a manner of speaking? We shall return to this point later. The terms designating ideal objects are exemplified by the term "mass point," which is the basic term in Newtonian mechanics (6: 354). A "mass point" is the ideal limit towards which, in the case of any material object, all progressive ap-</page><page sequence="4">THE PROBLEM OF PHYSICAL REALITY 217 proximations of the exact spatial position of the center of the mass of that ob- ject converge. "Mass points," being thus but abstractive idealizations of "things," do not interact with "things" and are therefore not "real" in the sense in which tables and chairs and stones are "real." No "mass point" has proper- ties other than those ascribed to it by definition. Why do we then invest "mass points" with six properties-namely, "mass" and five properties involving "posi- tion" and "velocity"-and not with more? The answer is, not that observation reveals no more, but that the pertinent laws of classical mechanics are "self- sufficient with respect to states defined in terms of these six quantities" (5: 180). All ideal objects in physics-"rigid bodies," "ideal gases," etc.-share with "mass points" the fact that they are the result of abstractive definitions. "Con- structs," on the other hand, are of a different nature, and there are at least two types of them. Let me illustrate. Consider, first, what was involved in the discovery of the planet Neptune. Certain deviations of the planet Uranus from its prescribed course could not be accounted for in terms of Newton's law of gravitation as applied to the distribu- tions and motions of all the known masses within the solar system. If the law was to be "saved," a disturbing factor outside the known system had to be as- sumed. Ingenious calculations based upon a careful analysis of the observed ir- regularities led to the assertion that an unknown planet of such and such mass existed in approximately such and such a position outside the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations confirmed this "prediction." The planet Neptune had been discovered. Let us note that the search for the planet Neptune was undertaken because, when faced with the choice of modifying a law otherwise well established or of declaring the facts to be incompletely known, astronomers preferred to retain the unmodified law. Let us note also that the predicted existence of Neptune was confirmed by observation. But consider now a case which has aspects parallelling the discovery of Nep- tune. I refer to the "discovery" of the neutrino. By 1931 it had become clear that certain processes involving the nuclear energy of atoms do not conform to the laws of conservation underlying the whole of modern physics. There arose thus again the question of procedure. Should the laws be modified to suit the facts or should the facts be "amended"? Since a modification of the laws would have had wide and unpredictable consequences for the whole structure of scientific theories, Pauli suggested in 1931 that the existence of an as yet unknown "elementary particle" might account for the discrepancies. Thereafter the search for the "neutrino" was on. Assuming the existence of this new "particle," Fermi suc- ceeded in 1934 in developing a theory of beta disintegration which accounts for all observed facts and preserves the conservation laws. The "neutrino" is dis- charged simultaneously with the beta particle (electron) and carries off the ex- cess energy emitted in beta decay. The theory also safeguards the continuous applicability of Fermi statistics which the emission of an electron alone makes inapplicable to the product of the beta decay. Everything seems thus to work out well. However, the new "particle" is of a peculiar nature. By definition it</page><page sequence="5">218 W. H. WERKMEISTER has neither mass nor electric charge but does have a "spin" 1/2 and obeys Fermi statistics. This means that the "neutrino," having neither mass nor charge, cannot interact with "matter" and is therefore experimentally unobservable. Its sole function is to "save" the laws of conservation. It puts in an "appearance" only when the facts of observation are not otherwise reconcilable with those laws. The "neutrino," in other words, is a construct introduced for the sake of retain- ing in unmodified form certain basic laws the modification of which would demand far-reaching and undesirable reconstructions of physical theory. The distinction between "things," "ideal objects," and at least one type of "constructs" should now be clear. The "ideal object" is the ideal limit of a proc- ess of abstractive definition applied to "real things." The "construct" is created by constitutive definition in order to "save" the validity of basic scientific laws. The "thing" is either an "ordinary thing," such as a stone or a chair or a Geiger counter, or it is a "real particle," such as a molecule, an atom, or a neutron, which is capable of interacting with "ordinary things."5 Is the electron a "real particle," and therefore a "thing," or is it a "construct" or an "ideal object"? The answer seems fairly clear when we keep in mind how the electron was discovered and what its properties are. It has an experimentally determinable mass and an experimentally determinable electric charge and is therefore capable of interacting with ordinary "things." It was actually dis- covered in connection with cathode rays, doing mechanical work and registering its presence upon an electrometer. It must therefore be regarded as a "thing." That it may not be a "particle" does not detract from the fact that it is "real" in a sense in which "ideal objects" and "constructs" cannot be said to be "real."6 I mentioned earlier that there are several types of "constructs." It will facili- tate later discussions if at this time I indicate at least one more. In the opening chapters of his Principles of Quantum Mechanics (3) Dirac develops a schematism of "ket" and "bra" vectors and their interrelations which enables him to derive the laws of modern quantum mechanics as theorems of an integrative system. The initial schematism is based upon the idea of "super- position of states." According to classical theories the state of a system7 can be specified by giving numerical values to all the coordinates and velocities of the component parts of the system at some instant of time. The motion of the system is thereby completely determined. In quantum mechanics, however, such complete determination of the state of a system is not possible because of the insurmountable limitations to observation imposed by the observational disturbance of the observed particles (Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty). 6 It is obvious that "constructs" may be discarded or may be identified with "things" or with "ideal objects" if this is warranted or demanded by the further progress of science. 6 "Fields," on the other hand,-the gravitational and electromagnetic "fields" of phys- ics, for example,-are in all essentials only "constructs" introduced for the purpose of "saving" the principle that "action at a distance" does not occur. If this principle is dis- carded, recourse to "fields" is unnecessary. The results of experiments are reconcilable with either alternative. 7The "system" is "composed of particles or bodies with specified properties (mass, momenta of inertia, etc.) interacting according to specified laws of force" (3, 11).</page><page sequence="6">THE PROBLEM OF PHYSICAL REALITY 219 It is for this reason that the schematism of superposition has been invented. Underlying the schematism is the assumption that between the states of a system "there exist peculiar relationships such that whenever the system is definitely in one state we can consider it as being partly in each of two or more other states" (12). Such a relationship cannot be explained in terms of classical physics. Our familiar physical concepts do not even suggest an analogy to a situation in which a system's being partly in each of two states is equivalent to its being completely in some other state. Yet this "drastic departure from ordinary ideas" (13) is needed for the development of the mathematical schema which yield the body of laws that is modern quantum mechanics.8 The complexus of ideas incorporated in the "principle of superposition" is thus a "construct" created by constitutive definition and for the sake of the system which rests upon it. This second type of "constructs" differs from the first-which is exemplified by the neutrino-in being basic to the entire system rather than being required to "save" a major law within the system. 3. Interaction. It is obvious from the preceding discussions that the problem of physical reality does not arise as far as "ideal objects" and "constructs" are con- cerned. Both types of "entities"-if such they can be called-are definitionally created for purposes of the system, one type by abstractive definition, the other by constitutive definition. In the case of "ideal objects" and "constructs" nothing can happen which does not analytically follow from their integration in a system of laws. It is quite otherwise with "real things," as experimental research amply proves. We have seen that molecules, atoms, electrons, neutrons, and other "elemen- tary particles" are regarded as "real things" because they interact, or can be made to interact, with ordinary "things." They are as real as are the "things" -such as screens and films, cloud chambers, Geiger counters and electrometers -employed in their detection. The problem of the reality of these particles, there- fore, reduces to the problem of the reality of "ordinary things." However, the meaning of the term "interact" must still be clarified. In physics this term has at least two distinct but interrelated meanings. Its first meaning is intra-systemic. In this sense "interaction" means that bodies having determinable properties (such as mass, moment of inertia, electric charge, etc.) move with respect to one another in conformity with specified laws in- corporating those properties. If the laws in question are second-order differential equations, the "interactions" are causal in the strict sense of classical mechanics. Prediction is in that case "absolute." But if the laws in question are the probabil- ity formulations of modern quantum mechanics, the conditions defined by Heisen- 8 "The non-classical nature of the superposition process is brought out clearly if we con- sider the superposition of two states, A and B, such that there exists an observation which, when made on the system in state A, is certain to lead to one particular result, a say, and when made on the system in state B is certain to lead to some different result, b say. What will be the result of the observation when made on the system in the superposed state? The answer is that the result will be sometimes a and sometimes b, according to a probabil- ity law depending on the relative weights of A and B in the superposition process. It will never be different from both a and b" (3, 13).</page><page sequence="7">220 W. H. WERKMEISTER berg's principle of uncertainty prevail in the region of subatomic phenomena and strict prediction is possible only in the realm of molar mechanics (6). In either case, however, "interaction" is simply behavior of the bodies-"elementary particles" and "things"-in conformity with specified laws. The second meaning of the term "interaction" is extra-systemic. It includes the activities of the experimenter who makes one body "act upon" another and observes what happens. Here the idea of conformity with laws is involved pri- marily in a broad and somewhat vague sense. Often the idea is no more than the general belief that "something will happen," that an interference with the nor- mal course of events will be followed by some observable "effects." Or, if a de- viation from a body's behavior according to established laws has been observed, the idea of interaction is essentially the belief that some unknown "cause" has "acted upon" the body in question and that this "cause" can be discovered among the "real things." "Interaction" in this sense is a basic presupposition of experi- mental research. It is also constitutive for the whole of "physical reality." As science advances, this loose but indispensable conception of "interaction" is redefined until it emerges as the purely intra-systemic idea of action in strict con- formity with specified laws. The interrelation of the two meanings of "inter- action" is thus preserved. For the concluding part of our argument we need rely only upon the extra- systemic meaning of "interaction." The rest will fall within the range of its com- prehension. 4. Interaction as Constitutive Category. We are now ready to suggest a line of approach which, if it does not lead to the solution of the problem of physical reality, has at least the merit of providing an epistemological perspective which reveals that problem in its intricate relations to the rest of our experience. On a number of occasions I have argued that all knowledge is indissolubly bound up with first-person experience; that it arises from and must find its warranty within that experience (6, 7, 8). I shall here presuppose those arguments and also most of the considerations necessary to a reconstruction of knowledge upon such a basis. There are, however, a few major points which are closely re- lated to the problem now under consideration and which therefore deserve re- newed attention. 1) Experience is always bi-polar, involving a subject-pole and an object-pole. Concentration upon one of these poles to the complete exclusion of the other is and always remains essentially abstractive. 2) The bi-polarity of experience, the discernment, that is, of "I" and "Other," is a pre-linguistic fact. The distinction between subject-pole and object-pole appears as we are stirred into full awareness in the course of primitive "action responses" to certain "stimuli." 3) When the subject-pole evolves into a "sign-consciousness," language is employed to fixate and to discriminate between articulated aspects of experience. Language is thus but a tool and the meanings of words and statements depend upon intent rather than association. The denotation of a term is the intended</page><page sequence="8">THE PROBLEM OF PHYSICAL REALITY 221 referent or the group of intended referents. But since intended referents are not always available for demonstration and, when available, must still be identified as the ones which were intended, a descriptive-procedural definition, rendering in- telligible the employment of the terms denoting these referents, must augment mere denotation. Only through such definitions do we attain complete intel- ligibility in our interpretations of experience. It is now obvious, I believe, in which direction we must look for a solution of the problem of physical reality. The object-pole, typified by (but vastly exceeding in many directions) our "visual field," is a highly diversified context of discernible "objects." Included in its articulated pattern are colors and sounds and kinesthetic sensations and such complexes of observable qualities as mirror images, hallucinations, nega- tive after-images, "tables," "stones," and "Geiger counters." Our first question is, Does the term "thing" denote referents which in some essential respects are not "sense qualities" or "compounds of sense qualities" and which have a mode of existence that is not exhausted in their being experienced? Our next question is, If the distinction indicated is warranted, does it enable us to determine the nature of "physical reality" as something distinct from but inherent in "things"? First, then, let us ask, Is A (i.e., some specified object of experience) a "thing"? What is in question here is, of course, the adequacy of the proposed descriptive- procedural definition of the term "thing"; and this adequacy cannot be deter- mined by rules of syntax alone. Let us suppose that A is a negative after-image of the design on a package of Lucky Strike cigarettes. We then find that this object is but a specifically patterned complexus of colors and shapes. There is nothing about it, as an object seen, or about any subsequent object of the same kind, that is not "given" within the configurational image as directly experienced. In a strictly phenomenalistic sense, the image is "all there is." In this same sense the image is "all there is" in the case of hallucinations and dream images. To be sure, some of these objects are relatively simple whereas others are complex; but the degree of complexity makes no difference in their status as purely phe- nomenal objects. Even the most elaborate "compounding" of phenomenalistic elements does not in itself convert such composita into "real things." In the case of the negative after-image, furthermore, a rudimentary form of prediction is possible-the prediction, namely, that in about 10 to 15 seconds the image will fade out but will be followed, after a brief interval, by another though fainter image of the same color pattern or, if I close my eyes, by a structurally similar pattern of "complementary" colors. This means that fulfilled predictions as such are not sufficient as a basis for our belief in real "things." Prediction must at least be restricted to certain types or interrelations of objects of experience. Perhaps the most basic restriction is that which requires corroboration through data belonging to various dimensions of experience (6: 86-87). Most prominent among these data are the facts of kinesthetic and tactile experiences. If we can "touch" what we "see," the object experienced in this complex manner of visual image plus tactile impressions localized at the place</page><page sequence="9">222 W. H. WERKMEISTER of the image in the visual field is at least in a class other than that in which we place objects, such as after-images, mirror images, and hallucinations, which cannot be experienced corroboratively. But we must be careful at this point. The crucial matter is not that certain objects are actually experienced in the corroborative manner, but that, under appropriate conditions, they can be so experienced; otherwise we could never assert that stars and planets are "real." It is obvious, however, that even the criterion of corroborative experience is inadequate, for electrons and neutrons and other elementary particles can be "seen") as little as they can be "touched." They cannot be directly experienced at all. It is my contention that both inadequacies of corroborative experience as a criterion of the reality of "things" can yet be overcome in terms of corroborative experience itself, for that experience gives content and meaning to the key idea of "interaction." Let me illustrate. By the time we have reached the level of reflective thought at which, in philosophic mood, we ask about criteria of physi- cal reality we have, as infants, acquired knowledge of our own "bodies." That acquisition was a slow process of realizing the corroborativeness of certain "seen" and "felt" experiences. This corroborativeness involves not only visual images and the sensations of touch and of warmth and cold (for our tactile sense is it- self complex) but also an experience of "effort" and of "resistance to effort." We not only experience the visual image of "right-hand-touching-left-hand," but we experience corroborative tactile sensations and, above all, the "resistance" of the "left hand" to the "right hand" as we try to put both hands in the same place in the visual field before us. Here, I believe, in this complex situation in- volving manifold corroborative and recalcitrant experiences we encounter the root meaning of the term "to act upon" and, more broadly, the meaning of "in- teraction." Admittedly this meaning is anthropomorphic; but, initially at least, man is the "measure" and his body the prototype of a "thing." Actual or possible interaction with his body is the primary touchstone of the "physically real." Interaction, thus encountered in first-person experience, is and remains the pivotal category upon which our whole system of physical reality rests. It is the basis which alone makes intelligible that pattern of interacting "things" which, as proverbial men-in-the-street, we all accept as "real." Interaction thus under- stood is and remains that extra-systemic category referred to earlier in our dis- cussion. However, the pattern of things established upon this basis remains frag- mentary. Moreover, the anthropomorphic strain in its basic category may lead us astray when we attempt to interpret the whole. Both deficiencies, however, can be overcome by a more precise definition of interaction-a definition, that is, which eliminates all gross anthropomorphic associations and liberates the idea of interaction from its close relation to the human body, and which thus restricts the meaning of the category to the essentials requisite for a comprehen- sive integrative system. Such a re-definition has been achieved in our most ad- vanced natural sciences in which interaction is analyzed into component motions</page><page sequence="10">THE PROBLEM OF PHYSICAL REALITY 223 in conformity with specified laws which refer to force, mass, charge, and other determinable variables. Interaction has become an intra-systemic category- an integral part, that is, of an integrative system of experience. But it is still constitutive for that system as a system of real things (7). Does such a system of things cast any light upon the idea of physical reality as such? That is to say, does such a system presuppose or imply certain essen- tially metaphysical assertions about the real things? The answer, I believe, is affirmative. The interaction, in its intra-systemic as well as its extra-systemic significance, is intelligible only under certain conditions. No category, in other words, is ever self-sufficient. Following contemporary physics in its integration of experience, we find these six stipulations rigorously adhered to: 1) There is matter-energy in space-time configurations;9 2) all events are but matter-energy transformations (i.e., matter- energy is neither created nor destroyed); 3) events take place only where there are non-compensated energy differentials; 4) events occur only in conformity with the principle of entropy; 5) events take place only in conformity with the principle of the conservation of momentum; 6) the laws of physics describe the specific manner of interaction within the whole realm of matter-energy. The six stipulations taken together define physical reality. Things are what they are because they are interacting events within the matter-energy pattern thus defined; and whatsoever can be completely interpreted in terms of these stipulations is an integral part of physical reality. Whatsoever cannot be so in- terpreted is no part of physical reality. Whether electrons, neutrons, and other elementary "things" should be con- sidered as "particles" or as "waves" is now a secondary question. However we picture them, they are real because they interact with other and grosser things in conformity with specified laws of force; and, because of this interaction, they are neither "ideal objects" nor "constructs." But the "probability waves" which determine the distribution of photons in an "interference pattern" are "con- structs" rather than things; for they themselves do not interact with anything. "Interaction" in its extra-systemic and intra-systemic meaning is thus the constitutive category of physical reality. It is the central core of that complexus of interrelated categories-substance, space-time, motion, and quantity in its many diversifications-which ultimately justifies our belief in that reality. Its referent is itself the interaction in conformity with laws, whereas "ideal objects" and "constructs" have no referent.
