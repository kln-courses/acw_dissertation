Schmidt Over the last three decades archaeologists of Africa have developed distinctive perspectives in their use of oral traditions in historical archaeology and ethnoarchaeology. Many of these innovations reflect the cultural attitudes of Africans about their own history and have lead to an archaeology that is increasingly sensitive to questions of an African historical identity free from the Western structure of thought. The African archaeo- logical tradition accepts, with materialist interpretations and explanations, the importance of symbolic sub- systems in a synthetic and systemic approach. Consequently, the application of structural and symbolic analysis to interrelated archaeological and ethnographic information is an integral part of an anthropological approach to the later prehistory and history of Africa. AFRICAN PERSPECTIVES This is a review of recent developments in that body of African research that explores cultural phenomena among living populations in Africa, in order to elucidate our understanding of change and continuity in prehistoric and historic cultures. The archaeological tradition in Africa has been conditioned by its distinctive cultural setting as well as its academic grounding in the British historical perspective. Consequently, a historical emphasis marks the practice of African late "prehistory." Given this emphasis, it is useful to compare it with the historical archaeology prac- ticed in North America and to question whether Western archaeologists of Africa can perform research that complements the historical interest and identities of African peoples. Ethnohistory and oral traditions will be a primary focus of this review essay because these are crucial to the examination of historical developmental problems, such as the emergence of the state in Africa. They are also among the most germane sources for explanatory and interpretative constructs that are reflective of the African mind. Archaeologists of Africa have long practiced ethnoarchaeology, for they have inquired into indigenous historical ideas and belief systems that relate to or give order to material relationships. Though ethnoarchaeology in Africa first addressed problems related to the ideational world, it came to be concerned with ethnotechnology, taphonomy, and other observational laboratory ap- proaches that I also review here. African archaeology is related to and partially derived from problems in sociocultural anthro- Peter R.

Because archaeologists of Africa have lived among peoples who still maintain viable indigenous belief systems, they have come to realize that cultural meaning in material culture and its spatial patterning often rests in ancient symbolic expressions which are still ac- cessible in the living cultures. Thus, symbolic and structural analyses are recognized as ap- propriate to the solution of historical problems; further, they are potential components of a syn- thetic science that may also employ a materialist approach (Schmidt 1978). In more complexly organized cultures where history is held in lineal, genealogical form, there is no reason to give credence to the doctrinaire assertion that the structural method imposes synchrony. The applica- tion of structural analysis to archaeological materials, belief systems, ritual, economic relation- ships, social relationships, and the historiography of different social groups can often point out parallel, systemic change in different domains of a cultural system (Schmidt 1978). Symbol systems in African cultures have often been the ideological cause for primary changes in political and economic relationships, as rival groups struggled to control access to wealth and power through control of the symbol system. Of particular interest, then, is how manipulation and control over symbol systems may lead to new organizational relationships that alter, say, access to critical natural resources and control over the means of production. Linked closely with ritual and symbolic systems are oral traditions that provide cultural insights normally unavailable to most archaeologists, or that are outside the cultural experience of the Western-trained archaeol- ogist. Thus an awareness has developed among practitioners of African archaeology that con- structs imposed by Western scholars are often devoid of meaning to African populations. This problem has been ameliorated by the incorporation of indigenous views of historical process. CONTEMPORARY ISSUES REEXAMINED One of the most critical issues facing archaeology in Africa (and North America) today is the need to perform research on problems that are significant to the historical self-identity of living peoples, particularly those descended from the prehistoric and historic populations we study. As anthropologists we cannot continue to perpetuate Western paradigms that militate against local historical sensibilities. This is particularly true of the practice of archaeology in the Third World (Miller 1980); it is even more poignantly relevant in Africa because of the colonial history of the West on that continent. Bruce Trigger (1980) has eloquently exposed problems in North American conceptualizations of aboriginal prehistory that betray an infatuation with science at the expense of history. A false dichotomy has arisen between history and science, says Trigger, "by treating generalizations about human behavior as being the primary or even the only significant goal of archaeological research" (Trigger 1980:671). Trigger does not suggest that archaeologists abandon concerns with cultural process, but that they address historical problems as a means to enrich Indian history, free it from dependence on the written sources of Euroamerican culture, and "stimulate archaeologists to ask new kinds of questions and to see significant new implications in their data" (Trigger 1980:673). Trigger's observations isolate clear differences in the respective develop- ments of North American and African archaeology. The use of indigenous historical views in Africa by archaeologists indicates that Africanists are not preoccupied with asserting "a false dichotomy between history and science in order to defend their discipline's scientific credentials" (Trigger 1980:673). In practice Africanists have long accepted Trigger's idea that "it is doubtful that a scientifically oriented history is any less objective than a nomothetic approach" (Trigger 1980:673). Any avowed dichotomy between history and science is reflective of the structure of Western thought about nonwestern peoples. Other "Semitic" oppositional dualisms (Kehoe 1981) such as primitive/civilized, literate/nonliterate, prehistoric/historic, and urban/rural pervade the thought of Western anthropologists and inhibit acceptance of local historical perspectives and phenomena that depart from this structure of thought (Schmidt 1982). For example, many of the traditional historiographic systems of Africa deny the legitimacy of the term "prehistory" when 63</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY applied to the last two millennia before colonial rule (Schmidt 1975). Prehistory is a concept load- ed with symbolic meanings that create perceptions of a hierarchical structure of historical ex- perience; the term carries pejorative connotations that denigrate the African historical ex- perience. If the dichotomy between prehistory and history has negative implications for nonwestern cultures, then so too does the dichotomy between literate and nonliterate. These categories deny many nonwestern histories, for they equate history with literacy, a fallacy revealed as such by the work of many African historians, especially by Jan Vansina (cf. 1965). The most immediate and obvious expression of this structure of thought in North America is the exclusive definition of historical archaeology as the archaeology of literate (mostly Western) cultures. The acceptance of both history and indigenous African historiographies by archaeologists in Africa marks their work as epistemologically distinct from the antihistorical perspective adopted by one school of thought in the historical archaeology of North America (e.g., South 1977; Binford 1977; Schmidt and Mrozowski 1981). Anthropologists such as Victor Turner, Mary Douglas, and Edmund Leach offer perspectives on culture that are complementary to the practice of an anthropologically based history in Africa. In this respect many Africanists would probably concur with Reid and Schiffer's position that culture is more than behavior: It seems appropriate that archaeologists recognize that culture is knowledge-a system of learned infor- mation and the rules for processing and transforming that information into action and behavior. Strictly speaking culture is not behavior [Reid and Schiffer 1973:2; cf. Binford 1981]. TRADITIONAL APPROACHES The most comprehensive overview of African Prehistory remains Desmond Clark's (1970) Prehistory of Africa, an out-of-print work that does not include the many archaeological devel- opments in Africa over the last decade. West Africa has been surveyed by Oliver Davies (1967) in West Africa before the Europeans. This book must be supplemented now with a wide variety of ar- ticles from such journals as the West African Journal of Archaeology and the Journal of African History. Mason's (1969) survey of the entire prehistoric record in South Africa has been super- seded in its consideration of the Stone Age by Garth Samson's (1974) The Stone Age Archaeology of Southern Africa. The most ambitious interregional synthesis since Clark's overview is David Phillipson's (1977) Later Prehistory of Eastern and Southern Africa. Phillipson covers only the later prehistory of the southern half of the continent which corresponds roughly with Bantu- speaking Africa. One of the distinctive characteristics of Phillipson's book is his inductive con- struct for Bantu migrations during the Iron Age. He argues from spotty archaeological informa- tion gathered since the 1950s, and from controversial linguistic evidence, that there were two primary "Streams"-eastern and western-of Bantu speakers that dispersed throughout central, eastern, and southern Africa during the Early Iron Age (e.g., Phillipson 1976, 1977:227-230). There is little question that there was significant movement of Bantu speakers into East and Central Africa, but the evidence is not sufficient to posit 12 different stages and substages of migration across enormous expanses of landscape. Such speculative constructs often gain cur- rency and become historical fact in African historiography, as have similar speculations in North American archaeology. Roland Oliver (1963, 1966) has steadfastly encouraged this line of geographical-historical reasoning (Posnansky 1968b; Schmidt 1975). His speculative ideas on Ban- tu migrations, based on scant archaeological evidence and questionable linguistic arguments, have influenced others such as Phillipson to devise even more elaborate, unprovable historical constructs. A synthesis of Iron Age archaeology in Africa is yet to be published. Africa in the Iron Age by Oliver and Fagan (1975) stops at A.D. 1400 and thus does not include much of what we know about the growth of complex political organization in Africa. Peter Shinnie's (1971) edited volume on Iron Age Africa includes summary considerations of different regions in Africa, while Fagan's 64 [Vol. 48, No. 1,1983]</page><page sequence="4">ANNUAL REVIEW OF OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY (1965) earlier regional synthesis of the Iron Age in southern Africa has now been joined by Thurstan Shaw's (1978) more restricted regional overview of the archaeology and early history of Nigeria. Some of the more recent findings on food production and its evolution are discussed in Harlan et al. (1976). The previously mentioned books are a sampling that provides the primary issues and main outlines of the culture-history of Africa. Other Significant Contributions If Africa is to develop an archaeological tradition free from the domination of Western thought and sensitive to local historical needs, then a number of problems in historical revision remain. Theories of racist origin must be eliminated, and the results of archaeological research that af- fect African historical identity must be disseminated to African populations. There is no question that racist theories about Zimbabwe continue to be propagated. For example, Gayre (1972) claims that those who seek to revise African historiography are practicing "politico-archaeology" and that What is so astonishing is that . . anyone should have irresponsibly plunged into the development of a theory of independent Bantu evolution of this civilization. It is completely out of character of the Bantu and has no justification from other Negroid parts of Africa past or present [Gayre 1972:5-6]. Peter Garlake's (1973) Great Zimbabwe disposes of the many racist theories surrounding those ancient ruins and brings order to the mass of excavated evidence. Garlake succeeds in a bal- anced, revisionist synthesis. Though his interpretation of the function of spaces at Zimbabwe overlooks the great variety of ethnographic cases in the region, Garlake nonetheless understands that oral history and ethnography hold the key to our understanding of the growth of Zimbabwe, its decline, and the symbolic meaning of many structures, monoliths, and anthropomorphic figures (Garlake 1973:203). Possibly the best example of successful communication of research results to local African populations has developed out of Thurstan Shaw's work in Nigeria. His excavations at the Igbo- Ukwu site (1970) in Nigeria have documented an important sacred shrine containing bronze castings and worked copper artifacts. His popular synthesis of this excavation, Unearthing Igbo- Ukwu (Shaw 1977), reaches a wide Nigerian audience and sets the Igbo-Ukwu finds in their cultural context for Nigerians. The ethnographic researches of Michael Onwuejeogwu provide Shaw with several alternative hypotheses for the possible cultural significance of the burial of a high-ranking person and a ritual hoard (Shaw 1977:94-102). To a local audience with cultural ties to the ancients, Shaw has made intelligible the significance of the archaeological problems under investigation. Shaw has provided an example of successful popular communication of the significance of research. ETHNOHISTORY, ORAL TRADITIONS, AND HISTORY Shaw's use of oral histories at Igbo-Ukwu is one of many attempts (e.g., Willet 1973; Posnansky 1969) to develop research approaches that complement local attitudes toward history. The viabili- ty of this approach has emerged from the research of scholars such as Jan Vansina (1965) who has employed a critical comparative method in his analysis of oral texts and advocated the use of ethnographic, linguistic, and archaeological research to check oral information. Pender-Cudlip (1972:4-5) has diagnosed Western attitudes toward the use of oral history. Western scholars hold ethnocentric views about oral traditions because such traditions often do not incorporate chrono- logical devices, such as dates, against which change is measured in Western historiography. In- stead, oral traditions contain genealogical information, age-set names, place names and places at- tached to specific events or historic eras, lists of rulers, cross-references to social-structural change and events mentioned in other sources, and symbolic allusions-all of which can be analyzed and used to fashion a comparative, chronological social history. Historical information that survives the initial witnesses to become part of an oral tradition that extends through genera- 65</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tions has continuing social and cultural significance to the group that preserves it. It is instructive to observe that one response to Miller's (1980) recent call for research germane to local interests was by members of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, Eduardo Mondlane Univer- sity, Mozambique. They argued vigorously that a truly African archaeology must incorporate oral traditions into any research program in later prehistory (Morais et al. 1980:715-716). The ethnohistoric approach in Africa derives from anthropology, as anthropologists have at- tempted to reconstruct the political and social systems of African cultures, particularly central- ized kingdoms. To accomplish this they have drawn heavily on ethnohistoric sources, particularly oral traditions. Their approach is best illustrated in the anthropological and historical literature about Uganda and Nigeria, where complex, historically important centralized states flourished. This approach soon evolved into a branch of ethnoarchaeology, for it became concerned with the study of human values and behavior associated with material culture; the goal was to attach cultural context to archaeological remains associated with centralized states. While the goals were historical, the approach was unequivocally ethnoarchaeological. One of the first attempts to combine oral traditions and archaeology developed at Makerere University, Uganda, with Roland Oliver's (1953, 1955; cf. Posnansky 1966) assertion that the an- cient Bacwezi gods (mythological gods given political, dynastic attributes) were in fact an ancient dynasty. Wrigley (1958) warned Oliver that the Bacwezi should be seen as a religious phenomenon with possible local political expression. A process of uncritical acceptance and transformation of oral traditions allegedly associated with large earthworks, such as Bigo, in western Uganda began in 1909 with a newspaper report. This was taken up by a historian, Sir John Gray (1935), who was followed by others who propagated the idea of extensive traditions associated with sites. By the 1960s the historiography of the Bacwezi at Bigo and other related sites had become an artifact of poorly informed European research and reified historical specu- lations. Peter Shinnie (1960) and Merrick Posnansky (1969) both excavated at Bigo, hoping to discover evidence for the by-now mythical Bacwezi occupation. Out of these attempts at clarifica- tion came further ambiguity. The claim that a royal enclosure was found (Posnansky 1969) cannot yet be accepted, nor is there sufficient evidence to argue for an invasion by Nilotic speakers from the north. While this is a pessismistic assessment of what were once considered seminal in- vestigations, it is no measure of the important potential that the oral traditions of western Uganda can have for our understanding of the development of centralized political authority. In sum, the oral traditions associated with the earthworks need major reinvestigation, as does the extant cor- pus of evidence, including the archaeology. The Verification Approach Posnansky (1968a) has also attempted to corroborate oral traditions attached to a royal capital, Bweyorere. His investigation was inspired by the historical work of Oliver (1959) with royal sites in the Ankole kingdom of Western Uganda. The site is not associated with a single, short-term oc- cupation but with as many as four successive royal occupations. While there is evidence for no more than two occupations, there is significant potential to correlate archaeological evidence in- volving a large burned structure with oral traditions involving a king who was burned in his palace after his brother had murdered him (Posnansky 1968a:172-173). Such use of oral tradi- tions belongs to the procedure here called the "verification" approach-a method well known to North American historical archaeologists. The historical investigations by Graham Connah (1975) into the antiquity of Benin, an urban center in Nigeria famous for its bronze sculptures, also fall within the verification approach. Con- nah discounts the possibility that there is much more to be learned beyond the already published oral traditions about Benin or from early historical accounts. Connah's investigations at Benin are a model for careful description and cautious interpretation, but as historical archaeology his endeavor lacks historical content. It is unfortunate that Connah did not investigate extant oral traditions held by current residents of Benin City. Instead, he is dependent upon the published oral traditions, the archaeological confirmation of which is one of his primary goals. Oral tradi- 66 [Vol. 48, No. 1, 1983]</page><page sequence="6">ANNUAL REVIEW OF OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY tions claim that Benin was founded in the midfifteenth century. Connah obtained a radiocarbon age of 645 ? 105 years (A.D. 1305) for the inner city wall, and another radiocarbon age of 610 =? 105 years (A.D. 1340) for a pottery pavement that he tied to the alleged reconstruction of the palace which also occurred during the midfifteenth century. The evidence is positive for the latter date, if we subtract one sigma, but these dates are not suffi- ciently conclusive to form a basis for an argument for the date of the city's establishment. It is probable that further research may open new vistas on the complex development of this early ur- ban center in the forest zone. The record of the city's territorial growth is held in the vast array of walls and ditches that crisscross it like a veritable mazeway. Connah's excavations touch the question of the origins and antiquity of the bronze art form. He shows that the leaded brass cast- ings are not early, but are apparently linked to the availability of large amounts of raw material obtained through European trade. Other Historical Archaeology Some excellent historical archaeology has been practiced in the course of the long-term West African trade project conducted by the University of Ghana and the University of California at Los Angeles. Merrick Posnansky (1975) has directed oral tradition, historical, archaeological, and other ethnoarchaeological researches at Begho, an ancient (A.D. 200) industrial center and later a commercial center in west-central Ghana. Two related historical problems that have arisen out of this research are why and when this large multiethnic trading and industrial center suddenly lost its population. In a synthesis of historical evidence, archaeological evidence (which am- biguously shows no sign of violent destruction), stool chronologies, and oral traditions, Tim Gar- rard (1982) isolates the collapse of this prosperous center to the late eighteenth century and at- tributes it first to interethnic conflict that arose from increased Akan hostility toward Muslims, and second, to tensions caused by a severely reduced trans-Saharan trade (Garrard 1982). Archaeology and Ritual Life There is a decades-old debate over the archaeology of Ife, Nigeria, an ancient Yoruba urban center with elaborate terra-cotta sculptures and ritual pots (Garlake 1977). The question is whether excavated concentrations are found in primary or secondary, redeposited, context (Eyo 1974). One characteristic of Ife shrines is that ancient terra-cotta sculptures have been placed in recent shrines, incorporated into contemporary ritual activities, and reburied (Garlake 1977). While terra-cottas have been found in primary context at the Ita Yemoo shrine (Willett 1970) and at Obalara's Land, Ife (Garlake 1974), the recovery of a terra-cotta head with sacrificial blood on it (Eyo 1974:100) suggests that there is a contemporary context for the study of recycling of Yoruba ritual objects. The continuities between ancient and contemporary, religious material culture and its spatial locations, such as the use of courtyards as special shrines (Garlake 1977: 94) and the use of groundstone axes as offerings, suggest important lines of inquiry, especially for Yoruba archaeologists. Eluyemi's (1977) report on survey and excavations at Isoya, south of Ife, indicates a wealth of symbolic, ritual, and religious information attached to space in a Yoruba settlement. The cultural meaning of religious locales demands understanding in the face of rapid modernization and religious change. Both oral histories and the ethnoarchaeology of such phenomena are critical parts of the construction of alternative models for the cultural meaning of material culture, its patterning, and its spatial distributions. African archaeologists (Andah and Okpoko 1976) have recently produced a revisionist critique of Western use of oral traditions, focusing on the work of John Sutton among many other Western archaeologists. Sutton (1973) has been one of the most earnest advocates of fusing ethnographic, historical, linguistic, and oral tradition evidence with archaeology. He has employed this ap- proach in his study of Sirikwa holes-small hollows found in the western highlands of Kenya and attributed to the Sirikwa by the Kalenjin people in their legends (Sutton 1966, 1973). Andah and Okpoko find a disparity between Sutton's ideal position and his practice: 67</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Even though he recognized that a fair amount of information was available for Kalenjin sense of the past from movements, clan and sub-clan origins, contacts with neighboring peoples, and wars, raids, and vic- tories, defeats, events which occurred in the times of different age-sets, his initial biases for predisposition against a society without "kingly or noble lineages" appears to have deterred him from identifying all possi- ble chronological reckoning devices, or ... realizing the full potentials of even those identified [Andah and Okpoko 1976:50]. This is severe but germane criticism, for it points to the fact that subtle biases of Western in- vestigators may sometimes inhibit the collection and analysis of some oral traditions that have the potential to illuminate processes of change and continuity. Oral Traditions and the Functions and Sociological Importance of Archaeological Sites There are many examples of the potential of oral traditions as locational, interpretative, and explanatory devices in history. One example is the work of Sutton and Roberts (1968), an ar- chaeologist and historian who collaborated in an investigation of the Uvinza saltworks in western Tanzania. Roberts's careful analyses of ethnohistoric sources and interviews demonstrate the potential that oral traditions have for the reconstruction of the salt trade and its role in nine- teenth-century state formation. The power of oral traditions to explain the functions and socio- logical importance of sites has been demonstrated in work throughout Africa. Soper and Golden (1969), in their survey of Mwanza Region, Tanzania, show that there are abandoned industrial sites in Geita District once occupied by Rongo iron smelters and smiths. Local people provide ex- tensive accounts of the activities carried out on the sites. The information collected by Golden (Soper and Golden 1969) provides a significant corpus of information on Rongo iron smelting otherwise unavailable in published accounts. Van der Merwe and Skully (1971) have also shown that there are very clear linkages between industrial sites in the Phalaborwa area of South Africa and oral traditions held in genealogical form. In one section of the genealogical history, significant events are associated with large rock outcrops (van de Merwe and Skully 1971:190), one of which was until recently the focus of annual rituals. The ties of social groups to these places and descriptions of the activities they carried out on the sites are well documented in oral traditions. When oral traditions are analyzed with rigorous methods that have been developed in history, anthropology, and folklore, the anthropologist in Africa will often observe patterns in content and structure that may correspond to the archaeological record. A content analysis of the oral tradi- tions of two related dynasties in Buhaya, located on the western shore of Lake Victoria in north- western Tanzania, reveals distinct historical periods, each with its own social institutions (Schmidt 1975, 1978). Symbolic and structural analysis of ritual life attached to the new institu- tions also reveals political alliances that incorporate religious groups. Because such histories are carefully preserved by lineal genealogies and by mnemonic devices (Schmidt 1978), traditions associated with specific kings are well remembered. Major social structural change occurred in Kiziba kingdom (immediately south of the contemporary border with Uganda) about the end of the seventeenth century, when the culturally alien royal dynasty neutralized local political opposition by creating rival religious cults and strong ritual alliances (Schmidt 1978). Oral traditions for the neighboring kingdom, Kiamutwara, indicated that the new dynasty also experienced fierce local opposition. The oral traditions associated with one king, Rugomora Mahe (who by genealogical reckoning lived about 1650), showed ritual alliances similar to those which the Kiziba dynasty had with indigenous clans. Structural, comparative analyses of royal and sacred Bacwezi myths then indicated that the royal clan had incorporated a significant corpus of myth into its dynastic history. Most obvious was the adoption of Bacwezi myth (also known in Uganda) attached to a sacred shrine physically occupied by the royals. Oral traditions preserved by mnemonic devices at the shrine located and explained the function of archaeological features, such as a forge dated to about 500 B.C. (Schmidt 1975, 1978). According to accompanying myth, the forge was used to build a large iron tower into the heavens. 68 [Vol. 48, No. 1, 1983]</page><page sequence="8">ANNUAL REVIEW OF OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY Archaeological investigation dated the royal occupation of the ancient ironworking shrine to ca. 1675, a date congruent with genealogical evidence. The beleaguered dynasty did not achieve legitimacy nor develop control over the productive economy (ironworking) until it physically oc- cupied the most sacred shrine controlled by indigenous clans and also adopted local oral tradi- tions-some of which appear to date back more than two millennia (Schmidt 1978). The archaeo- logical evidence challenges our perspectives on the historicity of oral traditions. Van Noten (1972) has been working on similar problems in Rwanda, though his original goal was to verify archaeologically the oral traditions and associated chronological constructs for the royal house in Rwanda (Van Noten 1972; Maret et al. 1977). Previously recorded oral traditions were used to locate royal burial sites. In most cases, Van Noten found no burials, but many anomalies. The traditional grave of Mutara I (dated by oral traditions to 1648) was associated with Early Iron Age pottery, and radiocarbon dated to ca. 230 B.C. (Maret et al. 1977). Another royal grave, that of Mutara II, was also associated with Early Iron Age Pottery and was dated to the mid-third century A.D. (Van Noten 1972). These results closely parallel the observations from Buhaya, 200 km east in Tanzania, where for political-economic reasons, manipulation of oral traditions and spatial control over indigenous symbols and ritual areas occurred (see below for further discussion). Van Noten's results appear to indicate that the symbolic manipulation of an- cient shrines was a dynamic process related to (1) political control over sacred space, (2) political territory, (3) political legitimacy, and (4) effective control over powerful social groups in control of the productive economy. The research of Susan McIntosh and Roderick McIntosh (1980a, 1980b) in southwestern Mali has contributed significantly to methodological innovation. Contrary to historical accounts that claimed the ancient city of Jenne on the Niger could not have been founded before A.D. 1250, the Mclntoshes applied carefully preserved oral traditions that claimed that Jenne-jeno was founded in the eighth century A.D. The site of the ancient city was identified in oral traditions. Excavation revealed that during the third occupation (the fourth through ninth century A.D.), the site had, in fact, become an urban center (McIntosh and McIntosh 1980a, 1980b). In East Africa, Skully (1969, 1979) used oral traditions to document the origins and functions of many walled "forts" or villages in western Kenya near Lake Victoria. Skully succeeded in eliciting information that is poignant testimony to interethnic conflict, especially between settled Bantu-speaking agriculturalists, who practiced a mixed economy, and pastoral groups such as the Masai. Skully (1979) hypothesized that the fortified villages of Luyia agriculturalists allowed them to penetrate areas previously dominated by pastoralists. His use of oral evidence is a viable line of inquiry, for oral traditions detail how corporate groups organized construction, segmented to establish satellite communities, and competed for critical economic resources with neighboring pastoralists. Growth toward settlement complexity occurred under conditions of economic com- petition for land, all of which is discussed in oral traditions. Here is an attractive context in which to study growth toward greater sociocultural complexity under frontier circumstances. Another useful study is by ten Raa (1969) who has worked among the click-speaking Sandawe, once hunter-gatherers who now live in central Tanzania. Ten Raa found that the Sandawe have special sacrificial hills where ritual sacrifices are made to clan spirits (ten Raa 1969:102). The hills are spiritual foci that symbolically define space for the patrilineal clans of the Sandawe, especially where rain priests remain influential. The Sandawe recognize physical boundaries be- tween clan groups and structure their residence within the ritually defined boundaries. This is a rapidly changing culture, and oral histories such as those collected by ten Raa are the only access we have left to the cultural significance of the spatial distributions of settlements and resource zones in Sandaweland. The importance of oral traditions to settlement studies is seen in Tim Maggs's (1976) study of Sotho settlement in Southern Africa and Henry Wright's (Wright and Kus 1979) researches into the settlement history of the Merina kingdom in Madagascar. Maggs (1976) has been able, through the use of oral traditions, to sort out four separate settlement phases for the Sotho people on the high veld of South Africa. Oral traditions about movements of social groups have provided information on house arrangements, compound size, and house types. Wright's (Wright and Kus 69</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 1979) research in the Malagasy Republic recognizes that oral traditions make up a valuable historical source to be synthesized with the archaeological record. In the effort to understand the emergence of the state, Wright and Kus see a close, but initially separate, relationship between the two forms of evidence so that each framework can be developed without prejudice before they are checked against each other (Wright and Kus 1979:12). ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY AND HISTORICAL PROBLEMS Archaeology can contribute to a renewed sense of historical knowledge in Africa if it works toward the development of a "theoretically based science of history" (Wright and Kus 1979). Alternative scientific explanations for African technological development provide one way that archaeology in Africa can participate in the enhancement of local self-identity. One fruitful line of inquiry has focused on the ethnoarchaeology of iron production (Pole 1974, 1975; Schmidt 1978, 1981; van der Merwe 1980). Ethnographic experiments and technological observations have pro- vided scientific evidence that some African iron technology is exceedingly complex and altogether different from European prehistoric iron technology (Schmidt and Avery 1978). Subse- quently, archaeological investigations have documented the antiquity of the advanced techniques of preheating and iron production to 2,000 years before present (Schmidt 1981). These results are currently being disseminated throughout Tanzania for educational use at the request of the Tan- zanians: public response inevitably reveals that these discoveries have profoundly affected African historical identity, heretofore structured by Western concepts. The ideology of historians and anthropologists has been that there was little to learn from African technology, that it was imported, and that it was relatively primitive when compared to European technology. This dichotomous construct with its hierarchical implications has blocked European comprehension of African iron technology. This is an important domain where the ethnoarchaeology of iron production can make significant contributions to African history and culture, as well as to economic development. The historical, ideological problem is the Western myth of technological inferiority in Africa. There is tremendous variability in iron production in Africa and much to learn from each living tradition. It is apparent that questions about the emergence of the state in Africa are connected to the organization of industrial production, trade, and industrial productivity. Only recently have archaeologists begun to look at the technological characteristics of iron smelters. Most observa- tions of African iron technology by archaeologists have been rather anecdotal (Phillipson 1968; Chaplin 1961; Haland 1980). The lack of either theoretical orientation or explicit archaeological problem characterizes some strictly experimental approaches, such as the laboratory ex- periments in iron smelting conducted in South Africa by Friede and Steel (1977). Such ex- periments lack ethnographic context and therefore fail to replicate adequately the indigenous technology. It is presently more urgent and important that Africanists conduct ethnographic studies of iron production, studies which are sensitive to social and ritual constraints, symbolism, the organization and recruitment of labor, scheduling, questions of efficiency and environmental effects, resource procurement and processing, technological processing, recycling, discard, and curation. ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY-OTHER PERSPECTIVES Many of the issues and problems I have reviewed above relate to complex agricultural societies, research on which is more remote in the literature than the ethnoarchaeology of small- scale societies and site formation processes. Over the last decade a new branch of ethnoarchaeol- ogy has focused on site formation processes (Gifford 1980; Behrensmeyer and Hill 1980) and on small scale African societies as a "testing ground" for archaeological theory (Gifford 1977). Yellen's (Yellen and Harpending 1972; Yellen 1977a, 1977b) work among the Dobe San of Botswana is undoubtedly the best known example of model building for material expression of economic and settlement activities of hunter-gatherers. This research has been taken a step fur- 70 [Vol. 48, No. 1,1983]</page><page sequence="10">ANNUAL REVIEW OF OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY ther with the excavation of an archaeological site with Middle and Late Stone Age components (Brooks 1978; Brooks and Yellen 1977; Brooks et al. 1980) in the Dobe area. Comparison of the spatial placement of deep pits found in the LSA deposits with contemporary San hunting prac- tices indicate that the most probable function of pits near game tracks is their use as hunting- blinds (Brooks 1978; Crowell and Hitchcock 1978). The study of taphonomy, or site formation processes, takes into account both natural and cultural processes (Gifford 1977, 1980; Behrensmeyer and Hill 1980). In Africa much research in taphonomic principles is being directed by the University of California Koobi Fora Project toward the identification of site-formation processes n early hominid sites. Diane Gifford's (Gifford and Behrensmeyer 1977; Gifford 1980) work among pastoralistss in northwestern Kenya has important implications for prehistoric sites, especially her observation of the effect of trampling on small faunal remains (Gifford 1980). Gifford also found that due to geographical setting, short-term sites are more likely to be buried swiftly and with minimal disturbance than are long-term sites (Gifford 1980:104). McIntosh's (1973) study of mud wall architecture in West Africa is experimental. He focuses on construction techniques and materials, dynamics of decay, and the archaeological recognition of patterns observed after decay and during excavations. In the same genre is Larry Robbins's (1973) observations of postabandonment decay at a Turkana homestead in western Kenya, and Dinah Crader's (1974) study of Bisa settlements and butchery stations in the Luangwa Valley of Zambia. Robert Foley's (1980, 1981) off-site archaeology in the Amboseli Basin of Kenya creates replicative methods for the investigation of continuous artifact scatters and taphonomic pro- cesses that affect artifact visibility. Observational Studies Desmond Clark and Hiro Kurashina (1981) have studied deformation (change of form) processes in the use of obsidian scrapers in Ethiopian hide tanning, an observational study with clear goals that significantly influences archaeological interpretation. One of their more important behavioral observations is that the densest areas of obsidian debitage do not mark processing areas but are in fact random and arbitrarily selected discard locales (Clark and Kurashina 1981: 314-318). Nicholas David's (David 1971; David and Hennig 1972) work with Fulani ceramics and house- hold compounds provides cautionary tales for assumptions about ceramic use-life and the perma- nence of structures in a Fulani settlement. David's work considers principles that can be tested cross-culturally. Robert Hitchcock's (1980) study of sedentary Bushman communities in Botswana shows that intersite and intrasite complexity increase significantly with sedentism, and that structures and technology become increasingly specialized. Diane Gelburd (1978), in her assess- ment of culture change among the Dobe !Kung San, observed variability of material culture across age groups and sexes. The need for a diachronic dimension to these studies shows that research in the region ideally must extend for several decades. The work of K. Agorsah (1982) among patriclans of the Nchumuru group in the Volta Region of Ghana includes a diachronic perspective. He considers the contribution of social group affiliation to the spatial locations of family compounds. Because Agorsah is working with a community recently burned out of its original settlement, he can identify former residence patterns and discern regularities in the new settlement pattern that are related to membership in social group and the veneration of ancestral shrines. Ian Hodder's (1977a, 1977b, 1978, 1981) ethnoarchaeology in Kenya and Zambia follows the testable hypothesis (1978, 1981) that groups in economic competition and close proximity demar- cate ethnic, territorial boundaries with distinctive material culture. This is an important hypothesis and therefore merits closer scrutiny. In his Zambian study Hodder (1981) focuses on several different ethnic groups living in a region formerly governed as part of the Barotse King- dom. Hodder wants to see if spatial variation in various items and traits of material culture cor- responds to ethnic distributions. The most obvious difference between local Lozi and alien Mbun- 71</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY da groups is the lack of wooden spoons in the Mbunda material inventory-a difference Hodder says is due to Lozi control over land and cattle, or, economic competition. Otherwise, their strong similarity in material culture is attributable to the "marked symbiotic economic relationship be- tween different groups in the Lozi kingdom" (Hodder 1981:55); this is the inverse of the conclusion he reaches in his Kenya studies, where he concludes (1978) that differences between material in- ventories are due to economic competition. Hodder offers no historical evidence that might but- tress his argument for the diminution of economic competition among these groups under central- ized power. Until such evidence is gathered, his argument must be considered speculative. One of Hodder's problems, common to many ethnographic studies, is to establish historical depth for the study of change in material culture. This is necessary background to any argument that dif- ferences in material culture reflect degrees of economic competition, for it allows one to judge whether, in fact, material culture inventories have previously mirrored different levels of economic competition. Without such documentation from rapidly changing cultures, Hodder's methodology does little to inspire confidence that change of material culture across space is con- gruent with change in level of economic competition. Hodder's earlier summary discussions (1977a, 1977b) of Njemps, Pokot, and Tugen history suggest that his hypothesis is not valid, for there he argues that 35 years ago (before the effects of centralized power) cattle raiding-or economic competition-was more prevalent, and there was greater uniformity in material culture and language (1977a:264, 1977b:122-123). There are cultural anomalies that demand explanation when juxtaposed to Hodder's syn- chronic model. The high number of cross marriages and cattle exchanges among the Kenya pastoralist groups (Hodder 1978:49) and the conscious manipulation of inventories by individuals as borders are crossed (1978:48) suggest that alternative hypotheses, such as membership in kin groups and length of time of affinal ties between groups, must also be considered. Hodder's hypothesis is important and attractive, but he has offered no historical evidence that testifies to the legitimacy of his synchronically generated model. A primary premise of Hodder's (1977a, 1977b, 1978, 1981) ethnoarchaeology in Kenya and Zambia is that different inventories of material traits are a symbolic expression of cultural identi- ty. He reckons that material culture among these people is used to symbolize or signal identities (e.g., 1977a:239, 1977b:129, 1978:58, 1981). The inventories, then, have symbolic meaning for Hodder. It is much less clear if an elaborate earring has any symbolic value for the Kenya pastoralists. We do not see any exegesis on values or beliefs and meanings attached to such items by the local people. The local, emic meaning has not figured into these studies, and until it has been integrated, any notion that different material inventories are symbolic lacks contextual meaning and significance. However, Hodder's dilemma is one common to this period of incipient realization that we must reincorporate nonmaterialist explanations into a synthetic scientific history (Tilley 1981). SYMBOLIC STUDIES Ideas are more important than things; creative imagination is deeply entangled with the formulation of verbal concepts; archaeologists need to appreciate that the material objects revealed by their excavations are not "things in themselves," nor are they just artifacts-things made by men-, they are representations of ideas [Edmund Leach 1977:167]. Edmund Leach's reflections on archaeology are appropriate to the practice of anthropological archaeology. Students of Africa have long observed that ritual life and symbolic associations are critical components in the location of social and political groups within compounds, within villages, within chiefdoms, and within kingdoms (Kuper 1980; Kuper 1972; Turner 1955). As I have indicated, Eluyemi's (1977) study of a Yoruba village indicates that the structure of the vil- lage and its wall are intimately linked with ritual and religious beliefs. The Dogon structure their homesteads, villages, and fields according to cosmological principles. As space and material culture are intertwined with religion in African cultures, it is imperative that the Africanists in- tegrate these concerns in any interpretations or explanations of continuity and change. There is a 72 [Vol. 48, No. 1, 1983]</page><page sequence="12">ANNUAL REVIEW OF OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY need, perceived among some Africanists, to include perspectives complementary to paradigms current in cultural anthropology. The ideational domain-beliefs, symbolism, cosmology, and ritual life-is accessible to the archaeologist in Africa, often under conditions of significant con- tinuity in both settlement and historical relationships to environment. Given the cultural dif- ferences that prevail between Western archaeologists and African culture, it is perhaps even more important that archaeologists attempt to discern nonmaterial meaning attached to material patterning in space. Without these constructs, how can the archaeologist hope to recognize and not to mistake the cultural meaning of spatial relations that derive from ideational constructs that influence certain artifact and structural categories? Symbolism and Rock Art J. D. Lewis-Williams's (1980, 1981a, 1981b, 1982) studies of San rock paintings in South Africa point to the value of symbolic studies that are grounded in ethnographic context. Lewis-Williams uses ethnographic data about the meaning of San rock paintings collected by Orpen and Bleek in the nineteenth century. His exegesis of symbolic forms in San art reveals that early speculations about religious concepts in the rock art were correct, and that further explanation of those ideas lay in San ritual (e.g., Lewis-Williams 1980, 1981a, 1981b). Lewis-Williams also uses the belief systems of the nonpainting northern San to supplement his interpretations; the absence of south- One of the most persuasive lines of reasoning is Lewis-Williams's interpretation of the ritual and religious meaning of an array of common San symbols. For example, his (1981a, 1981b) ex- egesis of the meaning of a sinuous red line often fringed with small white dots is instructive. Drawing on diverse ethnographic observations, including the valuable nineteenth-century ac- counts, Lewis-Williams sees the line as a symbol for ritual trance-to cure, to control game, and to travel out-of-body, all conditions of potency. In his consideration of dying elands juxtaposed to "dying" (in trance) medicine men, Lewis-Williams sees a strong symbolic transformational rela- tionship: the medicine man is ritually analogous to the dying eland toward which the game- controlling ritual is directed. Lewis-Williams's careful interpretations of San rock art demonstrate the need to bring ethnographic context to this highly speculative area of archaeolog- ical interpretation. His analyses assert that religious and ritual considerations were primary forces in graphic depictions among the San. Symbolism and Community Thomas Huffman's (1981) recent article, "Snakes and Birds: Expressive Space at Great Zim- babwe," is an experimental attempt to bring cultural meaning to space and form at Zimbabwe. Huffman draws upon nineteenth-century and twentieth-century accounts of southern Sotho values, beliefs, and rituals as well as early travellers' accounts of political entities in the same area. Huffman argues that the Acropolis, as a hill, is symbolically related to concepts and mythol- ogy that surrounded male political authority among the Shona people. Huffman interprets the function of spaces within the Zimbabwe settlement, using limited, contemporary oral evidence and written sources. Mythology that associates snakes with royalty, artifactual evidence with snake depictions, along with other symbols are all used to establish that the royal enclosure is on the western side of the Acropolis-not in the Great Enclosure as many have previously specu- lated-and that the back or Eastern Enclosure of the Acropolis is associated with ancestor wor- ship and rainmaking. Symbols of procreational meaning predominate in the eastern quarter of the settlement, contiguous to the Great Enclosure. Huffman proposes that the town layout is ordered by values of life forces that are oriented in an east-west axis and that male/female status can be discerned on an axis at right angles to the first axis. The symbols associated with the Great Enclosure are perhaps clear at the two entrances- which Huffman distinguishes as distinctly male and female-but his exegesis of symbolic associa- tions within the Great Enclosure is less clear. Sexual dualities exist there, and Huffman's struc- 73</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tural model is not sufficiently precise to account for these. If the direct continuities he suggests do in fact prevail, and if space was organized at Zimbabwe according to these symbolic principles, then similar patterns should be observed at related sites. Huffman proposes to test his assumptions at the Khami ruins, occupied after Zimbabwe. However, his test of his hypothesis at the Khami ruins is not as rigorous as was his initial inquiry, and he does not adequately account for some of the dissonance between the two spatial configura- tions. The model Huffman has outlined for Zimbabwe is a major development in archaeological methodology, but it needs to be refined and to have more rigorous tests applied. Moreover, Adam Kuper (1980) has shown that there is remarkable diversity of symbolic meaning associated with compound arrangements among related ethnic groups such as the Swazi, Zulu, Bomvana, and Mpondo of southern Africa. This cautionary tale compels detailed ethnographic studies to deter- mine the range of possible variation in symbolism and space among groups in the contemporary nation-state of Zimbabwe. Symbolism, Iron Production, Place Names, and Archaeology Symbolism associated with iron production in Africa is tied directly to the material arrange- ment of industrial structures, the selection of work sites, the status of the craftsmen, and the rituals associated with the technological process. Pierre de Maret (1980), among many others (e.g., Cline 1937), has drawn attention to the important status, high rank, wealth, and symbolic power of ironworkers in African chiefdoms and kingdoms. The emergence of the state is marked by an extension of control over ironworkers and a corresponding diminution of their wealth, authority, and symbolic strength (Schmidt 1978), all of which suggest that such changes are measurable and must be understood by those concerned with the evolution of the state. The spatial placement of industrial activities associated with iron smelting is deeply influenced by ritual considerations such as taboos against female participation and proximity (Maret 1980; Cline 1937), and the form of the iron smelting furnace is often influenced by symbolic considera- tions. For example, the Luchazi and the Luba of central Africa built furnaces shaped in the form of a woman (Maret 1980). In some Bantu-speaking cultures, such as the Shona, the furnace was shaped with breasts and the opening for the extraction of the iron was vaginalike in shape and spatial placement. These phenomena are testimony to the powerful symbols of procreation at- tached to iron production, ideational constraints that have led to distinct patterning in the ar- chaeological record. Procreational symbolism attached to the sacred Haya shrine taken over by the recent dynasty in Kiamutwara kingdom in northwestern Tanzania illustrates some of the potential symbolic studies have in the study of state systems and their development (Schmidt 1978). As previously in- dicated, dynastic incorporation of the shrine's sacred traditions and symbolism was an integral part of the extension of political and economic control over indigenous ironworkers and local religious and political authorities. The symbolism is to be found in Haya mythology and naming processes. Mythology associated with the shrine says that the king built a large iron tower, which then collapsed and fell partly on a neighboring ridge where today there is a village called Katerero. The name "Katerero" also means "beating, beating," a sexual practice when the male beats his penis on the female genitalia, eliciting vaginal fluid called Kiisi. So, the name of the sex- ual practice is applied to the iron tower (or vice-versa); this naming process, metonomy, is trans- formational and clearly reveals the iron tower as a beating phallus. The village located immediately below the iron tower is, transformationally, named Kiisi. Notably, there is a stream running through the village that is also called Kiisi. Thus, the spatial, geographical placement of the iron tower to the stream replicates the spatial relationship of the penis to the vagina and clitoris during the sexual act using Katerero. The iron tower is for the Haya the axis mundi, the cosmic pillar connecting earth and heaven (Eliade 1961). It brings together both domains, symbolically uniting iron production with procreation. As long as this important symbolic complex remained spatially independent of dynastic control, the incipient dynasty remained culturally alien, distinct, lacking legitimacy (Schmidt 1975, 1978). 74 [Vol. 48, No. 1, 1983]</page><page sequence="14">ANNUAL REVIEW OF OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY The relocation of the dynastic capital to this site assumes much greater meaning once its ritual, symbolic attachment to iron production is realized. SUMMARY One of the paradoxes of the widespread acceptance over the last two decades of a holistic systemic approach is that there has been a strong reaction against explanations and interpreta- tions that emphasize the symbolic subsystem. Instead, a systemic approach "should have helped free the discipline from its artifactual base and precipitated idealist, as well as materialist, inter- pretations of the past" (Kohl 1981:91). This review has featured current approaches in African archaeology that integrate the ideational domain of culture to develop interpretations and ex- planatory constructs. This is theoretically compatable with a materialist perspective, for a systemic view of culture includes the symbolic subsystem which also encompasses ideas about history. Oral traditions, myth, ritual, and other ethnographic data used by African archaeologists in their study of history and problems such as state formation are rich, vital sources for the develop- ment of more complex and less deterministic explanations for culture change. It is apparent that ethnoarchaeology and historical archaeology in Africa have pioneered perspectives that are sen- sitive to history, symbolic systems, and the historical sensibilities of local peoples. This further suggests that when cultures in Africa participate in the interpretation of their own past, we can begin to build a self-enriching tradition of archaeology free from the domination of Western paradigms and appropriate to the African setting.
