<plain_text><page sequence="1">REMEDIATING GORILLA GIRL! RAPE WARFARE AND THE LIMITS OF HUMANITARIAN STORYTELLING GILLIAN WHITLOCK For Jennifer Harold We might conjure some of the sites that, in recent memory, have generated the most pressing debates and intense questioning of human rights. . . . [Tjhese wars and conflicts, for good or ill, have helped shape and define the shifting grounds both of rights and of what it means to be human. Ian Balfour and Eduardo Cadava (279) Late in 2006 in Johannesburg, just by chance I met an aid worker from Goma, and heard a harrowing first person account of witnessing the traumatic suffer ing of women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). She described a degeneration of society beyond ordinary imagining, and spoke of her own frustration that she was not eloquent enough to write and do justice to the traumatic gendered violence she witnessed. More generally, she raised the question of how networks of humanitarian witnessing might become en gaged in the eastern DRC now, in the interests of victims of rape warfare. Then, most memorably, she spoke of a specific community that concerned her and her colleagues in World Vision: a small group of African women and children struggling to survive together near Lake Kivu, "just across the bor der from where Fossey watched the gorillas." The contrast is striking: Dian Fossey and the gorillas remain familiar figures in a global public sphere. But how do the testimonies of Congolese women find recognition beyond their immediate familial and communal networks? What follows unfolds from this conversation, and explores this implied adjacency of absence and legendary presence to consider the visibility of African people and creatures and the claims of animal and human rights in shaping a Congo "watch" from afar. Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) © Biographical Research Center</page><page sequence="2">472 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) Vivid memories of Dian Fossey and the mountain gorillas raise questions about how life narratives engage in representations of the Congo region, after genocide in Rwanda and the associated and ongoing suffering in the DRC. How does the Fossey life story relate to the ongoing presence of mourning and violence in central Africa now? How does it contribute to contemporary feminist engagements with "distant suffering" that are productive for the vic tims of trauma at this unique contact zone where species meet? Ongoing remediation of life narrative renders both Fossey and the moun tain gorillas associated with her familiar subjects of biographical representa tion. The "gorilla girl" celebrity persona survives long after the violent death of Fossey and the gorillas she originally recognized as creatures of unique and individual significance. Girl and gorilla are revived through ongoing auto/bio graphical adaptation and remediation in documentary, autobiography, biopic, and biography. By pursuing how various genres of life narrative arise and cir culate, how they are produced and consumed, regenerated and remediated, and how they accrue value as truth, we can engage with these questions about the recognition of subjects and subjectivities through rights discourse in nar rated lives, and consider how animal rights and human rights claims coin cide, and on occasion contest, in humanitarian discourse. The gorilla girl corpus is a compelling narrative of cross-species engagement; it expands our recognition of humans and animals as companion species, and it extends the scope of humanitarian compassion across the species boundary. Yet concerned claims that animal rights prevail over human rights in representations of the region abound—most commonly in observations by journalists that their ac counts of the genocide in Rwanda and its violent aftermath in the DRC now must include reports on the fate of the mountain gorillas to raise interest and compassion in the global public sphere (Melvern; Dawes). The implication that an empathie engagement with this endangered species overshadows the pursuit of human rights and social justice by and on behalf of African people suggests that the relationship between the force of the Fossey legend and the recognition of central African women's testimony is not just proximity— nearness in place—but propinquity: a deeper kinship that arises from their presence together in this location, historically a shared space of gendered and creaturely vulnerability. Recently Wai Chee Dimock has taken "remediation"—conventionally un derstood as the distilling, extracting, and relaunching of old media in new— and extended it into a broader application, suggesting that remediation grasps how genres are constantly subject to "cumulative reuse, an alluvial process, sedi mentary as well as migratory" (1380). Dimock's approach to the "reproductive" history of genres and media in terms of "kinship networks" suggests a method ology for tracking the transits of life narrative in terms of ongoing adaptation</page><page sequence="3">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 473 and appropriation. By mapping how the Fossey story migrates, mutates, and is subject to osmosis through remediation, I mean to explore the ebb and flow of trauma story from the Congo region, and suggest what this can bring to femi nist debates about representations of gendered violence, and rape warfare most particularly. Here, humanitarian storytelling is reconfigured by the powerful presence of "other" lives: the gorillas that challenge the species boundary and offer the possibility of living imaginatively in another creature's world.1 At Kivu now, people and primates are together in a contact zone fractured by overlapping and contrary regimes. These adjacent sites are the legacy of colonization, decolonization, and globalization: the nation states of the Dem ocratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), Rwanda, and Uganda (produced in the aftermath of Belgian, German, and British colonialisms); game parks and tourist enclaves; humanitarian zones where NGOs prevail and refugee camps proliferate; areas where warlords organize militia; ethnoscapes where different tribal identities retain currency amidst the volatile regional diasporas of Hutu and Tutsi; and security zones where mercenaries and private military companies maintain order on behalf of transnational corporations.2 Across all of this is the Virunga ecological habitat of the mountain gorilla. Amidst this we are called upon to imagine spaces where survivors of rape warfare gather as collectives of shared trauma. Since the rebellion of 1998 several hundred thousand women and children have been the victims of rape in the DRC, and the eastern regions of the Kivu province are the most severely traumatized. In Kivu now, rape warfare is structural violence: systematic, ongoing, and puni tive. Most often the perpetrators are from the militias that occupy the borders of Rwanda and the DRC in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and they rape with impunity.3 That a Canadian aid worker stationed in Goma and an Australian aca demic en route to a conference on testimony and reconciliation in Cape Town find common cause on the subject of humanitarian storytelling should not surprise. We both work in institutions that play a major role in the dissemina tion of testimony in a global public sphere. But at this point we are drawn to consider the limits and constraints of human rights discourse. World Vision, an NGO that pursues a Christian relief, development, and advocacy mission, maintains a substantial presence amidst the vast gathering of aid agencies headquartered at Goma in the DRC, which has been a center of humanitar ian work in central Africa in the wake of the Rwandan genocide.4 Scholars in life narrative are also invested in trauma story, and the genres of testimony and witnessing. "Humanitarian storytelling"—James Dawes's term for the life stories that are mediated by humanitarian and human rights workers— uses the language of human rights to draw attention to trauma, exploita tion, and injustice. These narratives give witness to atrocity, and are beset</page><page sequence="4">474 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) by ethical difficulties that are the subject of Dawes's book: how does bearing witness to suffering diminish and amplify the damage? How are the stories of the survivor translated, edited, and reproduced to fit the officially sanctioned human rights vocabulary of aid institutions? There is a further question of concern here: how do discourses of humanitarian storytelling engage with thinking on the limits of the human, and what falls from this? Humanitarian storytelling has the power to create spectators of suffering who engage empathically with terrible events; it generates compassion and benevolence, and elicits donor support. At the same time, it can be called to account for the part it plays in representing communities and people as in habitants of a "developing world," and subjects of "distant suffering" offered for western benevolence and spectatorship (Boltanski; Chouliarki; Hesford; Schaffer and Smith). What arose in that brief encounter in Johannesburg was a subjective yet shared worry that the networks of humanitarian storytelling are also unreliable, and that narratives of endemic rape warfare might remain unrecognized despite the encoding of rape as a human rights violation in the wake of the Bosnian crisis late in the last century. This raises questions about how genres of life narrative thrive and falter, or in the case of the Fossey sto ry, how one life narrative becomes legendary, even hegemonic. Is the limited agency of humanitarian storytelling in the case of the women of Kivu en tangled with the preeminence of Fossey and her gorillas in a global collective memory? How do human and animal rights claims travel in the ideoscapes and mediascapes of trauma story? Are the transcultural networks of rights dis course and the traumatized subjects they empower connected in a competitive economy where violent and traumatized narratives of suffering and loss accrue different value, currency, and exchange? At Kivu now, structural violence calls into question how specific lives are recognized as subjects fit for compassion. THRESHOLDS OF DIFFERENCE Questions about the traditions that have made some traumatic histories and memories visible are not new. The Congo circulates in western narrative as a notorious space where the limits of the human are subject to negotiation. Most notably, the brutal history of Belgian colonial exploitation in central Africa drives Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness, producing a mythi cal, aestheticized location that haunts subsequent representations of central Africa. Recently the novelist Caryl Phillips has commented that modern de scriptions of famines, war, and genocide are eerily prefigured by Conrad, and Heart of Darkness abounds with passages that seem terrifyingly contemporary in their descriptive accuracy (3). It is the question of whose traumatic history and memory is recorded in this narrative that energizes postcolonial literary</page><page sequence="5">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 475 criticism, which endorses Chinua Achebe's powerful critique of Conrad's work as an "Africanist" text: both a condemnation of colonialism and a pow erful projection of primitivism onto African space and peoples. What is less commonly recognized is its critique of humanitarianism. Marianna Torgov nick's feminist reading of Heart of Darkness observes that the fallen Kurtz is the author of a humanitarian treatise, an eloquent report written for the "In ternational Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs." In fact, it is this humanism and liberalism that draws Conrad's embedded narrator Marlow to Kurtz with a sense of common cause. In the marginalia of this report Marlow finds Kurtz's scrawl: "Exterminate all the brutes!" (182). As Torgovnick ob serves, this marginalia insidiously doubles and parodies the loftier language written into Kurtz's humanitarian text (150). This feminist approach extends the well-established critique of Africanist discourse in Conrad's novella by drawing attention to the enfolded presence of the savage and the brute at the edge of the page. Here, at this threshold, the category of the human is unsta ble, and the speciesism that secures the humanist subject is subject to change. That Conrad's novella opens a way to thinking about the place of the animal other is part of its "eerie" ongoing relevance. Anxiety about what it means to be human, discourses of the animal oth er, and a radical rethinking of the species boundary are endemic in the after math of colonialism here. These surface in the transcendent—the experience of cross-species recognition that is the heart of the Fossey story—and the trau matic—the relegation of ethnic groups to animality that drives the hate media of genocidal violence.5 Either way, violence and suffering render the humanist subject unstable, and, it follows, the recognition of subjects fit for compassion is fragile. Judith Butler's recent work on the interpretive frames that shape our responsiveness to others is useful here: it emphasizes that the cultural contours for thinking about the human set limits on what losses can be recognized and mourned. Following Butler's thinking on "precarious life," we can recognize mourning as a sign of where the borderlines of the human can be drawn, or (it follows) as a point where frames of reference might be called into question to extend the limits of recognition. To recognize those subjected to violence, she suggests, "it is not a matter of a simple entry of the excluded into an estab lished ontology, but an insurrection at the level of ontology, a critical opening up of fundamental questions: What is real? Whose lives are real? How might reality be remade?" (Precarious Life 33). These questions about what makes for a grievable life open directly onto concerns about the recognition of sub jects of violence and the speakability of trauma in humanitarian storytelling. How do auto/biographical narratives trigger recognition of grievable life? Can they extend the limits of recognition, and grasp "that something was possi bly outside, which made the very sense of the inside possible, recognizable.</page><page sequence="6">476 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) . . . Something exceeds the frame that troubles our sense of reality; in other words, something occurs that does not conform to our established under standing of things" (Frames of War 9). THE BIOGRAPHY OF GORILLA GIRL Dian Fossey arrived to establish a research station near Lake Kivu in Zaire in 1967. This was already hallowed ground in the history of representations of civ ilization and nature, and the association of human and animal worlds. The pri mates featured in the Akeley African Hall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York were taken from here in the early 1900s, and the setting of the diorama of the gorilla group at the Museum features Lake Kivu and the Virunga mountains.6 Carl Akeley died in the forests of Kivu, and when Fossey sets up her camp at the meadow near Akeley's remains, she cherishes the asso ciation. In her memoir Gorillas in the Mist (first published in 1983) she points out that Sanwekwe, the tracker who enabled her own first encounter with the Virunga gorillas, tracked for Akeley. Later Sanwekwe had worked for George Schaller, whose memoir of his time living at the same Kivu site, The Year of the Gorilla, inspired Fossey. The association of technology, conservation, and sci ence in explorations of the species boundary are embedded in this location, and the presence of Akeley's remains is a harbinger of Fossey's own fate. Yet in ways that are important for this inquiry into gendered violence in the DRC, her history is very different from these male precursors. Fossey's career is critically located at a series of shifts in disciplines of science, tech nologies of popular culture, and discourses of conservation, and these trigger a reframing of the species boundary that opens questions about whose lives "count." At first glance, the gorilla girl persona appears to be a compliant crea ture, created to inform and entertain the new mass media audiences of the 1970s through a photogenic and gendered narrative that engages with debates about the "origins of man" in popular science. Donna Haraway's classic work of feminist interdisciplinary scholarship, Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science, maps Fossey's place in the emerging science of primatology and its reinvention of nature in the third world for first world audiences.7 Changing knowledge about the origins of the human and its relations to the animal were mediated by the new technology and aesthetics that pioneered modern genres of wildlife documentary for television audiences in North America. The National Geographic Society supported a host of pri mate projects under the auspices of the primatologist Louis Leakey. The trio of researchers selected by Leakey and sent into the field in Tanzania, Zaire, and Indonesia—Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Biruté Galdikas—first ap peared in a series of five National Geographic public television documentaries</page><page sequence="7">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 477 and magazine articles in the 1970s, and this franchise produced images of the "trimates" (as the trio were sometimes known) and chimps, gorillas, and orangutans that are now embedded in popular cultural memory.8 The infrastructure of the gorilla girl story is a classic postcolonial narrative: the first contact between human and nonhuman primate, here a transcendent moment of cross-species touch, and a gendered, embodied experience that goes beyond speciesism to reconfigure the species boundary. At its heart is con tact with the "other"—in the Fossey story, a space occupied by the Virunga mountain gorillas. This translates the contact narrative to ontological border zones, where primates occupy a privileged relation to nature and culture. Two transformed beings are created here. The first is gorilla girl. Fossey enters the wilderness and imitates primate behavior: she crawls, practices vocalizing, and enters the gendered hierarchy of the primate group. In a sexualized and gen dered display, she is available to the touch of the male primate. In turn, the gorilla offers the gift of recognition in a climax of the cross-species recognition: the touch of hands is pivotal in the choreography of contact. A second being that is reborn through cross-species contact are the gorillas: they are individu alized and given proper names; they are classified in patriarchal heterosexual family groups, and civilized as noble, loyal, and intelligent.9 For Fossey, the massive silverbacks are the ultimate patriarchs, "peaceful disciplinarians within their own family group structures" (70). One of the legacies of the silverback Peanuts, just after he has first touched Dian Fossey's hand—the gorilla occupies center frame (Robert I. M. Campbell/National Geographic Stock).</page><page sequence="8">478 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) she names Beethoven and his family unit is, for Fossey, an example of civilized behavior for human society (105). Here gorillas become recognizable as bio graphical subjects: they are rendered in the gendered, sexed terms of western individualism. The behavior of later generations of these gorillas is analyzed psychologically, as bearers of a Freudian unconscious. To this extent the Fos sey story brings gorillas across a species boundary into "civilization," where rhey become bearers of the hallmarks of western individualism. CULTIVATING CURIOSITY Recently, feminist work has opened some new perspectives for pursuing the legendary presence of Dian Fossey. Donna Haraway introduces this shift, just as her earlier Primate Visions first grasped the role of the trimates in the articulation of science, technology, and gender in postwar primatology. A re formulation of Fossey's experiences is implied in a long footnote in Haraway's When Species Meet (2008). Here she returns to Fossey's memoir in a spirit of "cultivating curiosity" to suggest that the "subject-forming entanglement" that produces gorilla girl is a harbinger of human and animal copresence as "com panion species."10 This alerts us to the ongoing importance of Fossey's auto biographical accounts in shaping feminist perceptions of embodied knowledge and affect that reconfigure the species boundary. Gorillas in the Mist intro duces "active conservation" subjectively in terms of a profound rebirth into wildlife preservation as an embodied knowledge.11 The memoir signals this from the very beginning when the autobiographical narrator recalls her first visit to meet Louis and Mary Leakey at the excavation sites in Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania in 1963. On first acquaintance and in her exultation at "being free under African skies" (2), Fossey runs down a steep slope, breaks her ankle, and sudden pain "induced me to vomit unceremoniously all over the trea sured fossil. As if this wasn't humiliating enough, I had to be unceremoniously hauled out of the gorge, piggyback style, by disgusted members of the Leakeys' staff" (2). This abjection of the "clumsy tourist" is the first stage of a progres sive transformation as she proceeds to her first encounter with gorillas shortly afterwards. What distinguishes Fossey's memoir is the powerful embodied proximity of the other: "Sound preceded sight. Odor preceded sound in the form of an overwhelming musky-barnyard, humanlike scent. . . . Immediately I was struck by the physical magnificence of the huge jet-black bodies blended against the green palette wash of the thick forest foliage" (3). In her memoir, the visual and ontological presence of gorilla is all consuming, filling the auto biographical frame with an overwhelming physical presence. Gorillas in the Mist \s a radical life narrative project, using memoir to con test speciesism and renegotiate the terms of relational biography. Its prefatory</page><page sequence="9">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 479 pages, for example, set out genealogies, but these are the family lines of the gorillas, not the autobiographer (Fossey tells us very little about her life before Karisoke). Portfolios of photographs included in the memoir are National Geographic close-ups of the gorillas, and few feature Fossey with them. Sig nificantly the camera lingers on the faces of the gorillas, and these images are essential to their recognition as individuals: "Certain faces must be admitted into public view, must be seen and heard for some keener sense of the value of life, all life, to take hold" (Butler, Precarious Life xviii). Close-up images of Fossey are rare; it is the gorilla not the girl who looks directly into the camera lens. "It was like being reborn" (17), she tells us, and in memoir Fossey nar rates this transformation into a new subjectivity, which transforms both hu man and animal as biographical subjects.12 Violence and suffering are crucial to the affect of this narrative: the gorillas are an endangered species. In this way, an important and apocalyptic compo nent of first contact narrative is enjoined: these creatures are in the process of dying away—the mountain gorilla "might possibly be doomed to extinction in the same century in which it had been discovered" (xviii). From the very beginnings of Fossey's memoir, then, the gorillas are the subjects of mourn ing. In this way the memoir returns us to Butler, producing a point of radical departure precisely on the recognition of subjects of violence, and the exten sion of mourning to include nonhuman primates. The memoir is imbued with traumatic suffering, with grief and loss, and it introduces tropes of burial and commemoration to the gorilla girl story. It is Fossey who establishes individu ally labeled burial sites for each of the primates, a sacrilege to the many Catho lic Rwandans. The incorporation of the gravesite into gorilla girl mythography preceded Fossey's violent death at Karisoke in 1985, and it is accentuated when she too is buried alongside Digit, the gorilla whose violent death and dis memberment by poachers was reported widely in the American press several years before. These graves are now powerful symbols which further draw the gorillas into frames of recognition, where they are commemorated biographi cally as beloved individual subjects. Rebecca Bishop has recently argued that the autobiographical writings of the trimates present an account of the lived experience of embodied subjectiv ity through an entry into the terrain of the other that informs debates in con temporary feminist epistemology: Butler's "bodily performativity," Elizabeth Grosz's perceptions of human bodies constituted in proximity and flow, and Rosa Braidotti's arguments on the bodily roots of subjectivity (Bishop 134). In When Species Meet, and the preceding Primate Visions, the influence of Fos sey is apparent as Haraway focuses on the performative experience of interspe cies communication to place animals and humans together as companion spe cies in processes of mutually constitutive "becoming": "To know companion</page><page sequence="10">480 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) and species together in encounter, in regard and respect, is to enter the world of becoming with, where who and what is precisely are at stake" ( When Spe cies Meet 19). This grasps the transformation of animal and human subjects in mutual recognition perceptively. However, what needs to be included in fem inist theorizing of the agency of gorilla girl at this point is Butler's insight that the work of mourning and violence in determining what makes for a grievable life can also challenge established ontologies, such as the species boundary and the meaning of what it is to be human. This generates the extraordinary affec tive force of gorilla girl narrative: a powerful empathie engagement across the species boundary is haunted by violent death. Animal and human subjects are intersubjectively constituted in the Fossey story, and both are victims of indis criminate slaughter in a region where violence and suffering drive apocalyptic fears for the degeneration of humanity. To all appearances this contact narrative is performative. However, a con vergence of knowledges, technologies, and aesthetics is fundamental to how we recognize gorilla girl. Technological innovation produced new possibilities for representations of cross-species engagement that draw upon an aesthetics of recognition to confound perceptions of the species boundary. New tech nology—lightweight synchronous sound cameras and film stocks of unprec edented sensitivity—opened up possibilities for capturing the intimate im ages of cross-species contact featuring Fossey and the gorillas. Close-up shots of primate faces, eyes, and hands were iconic features of gorilla girl wildlife documentary; these embodiments of identity and individuality are the essence of self in western ideology and psychology of the individual. The face in par ticular is associated with interiority, and the possibility of drawing near to the human face in close-ups that bring the viewer into unusual physical intimacy with the film subject is a unique and distinctive quality of the cinema: "With out the human face, much of what matters to us in films would vanish" (Mac Dougall 51). To register the faces of individual primates this way draws them into a humanizing frame of reference, where they acquire attributes of intel ligence and comprehension, and where they become subject to recognition in ways that reconfigure what is human, what is precarious, what is injurable. CELEBRITY Remediations of the gorilla girl narrative recur, then, in landscapes where a powerful embodiment of cross-species contact is embedded in an affective ex perience of grief and loss. Fossey was murdered in her quarters at Karisoke in 1985, shortly after the first publication of her memoir. A rapid celebrification occurs at this point. First, Fossey's violent death, like Digit's, produced inter national media attention and a widespread mourning that came to focus on</page><page sequence="11">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 481 a new and potent site of symbolic postmortem cross-species "touch": gorilla and girl are buried alongside each other in the gorilla graveyard at Karisoke. Second, in a rapid and radical process of adaptation, Fossey's celebrity was both transferred and enhanced by the casting of the American actor Sigour ney Weaver as Fossey in the biopic based on the memoir, filmed in Rwanda amongst gorillas observed by Fossey, and released in 1988. Michael Apted's film Gorillas in the Mist is a remediation that adapts the Fossey story various ly: it selects from the accumulation of gorilla girl narrative that has preceded it; it incorporates via reenactment versions of the National Geographic docu mentaries with particular emphasis on the cross-species first contact; it selects from the memoir and takes the title forward; it includes new fictional mate rial; and it concludes with an African intervention that produces a symbolic connection of human and animal remains at Fossey's grave in Rwanda, and that recognizes the presence and agency of African people at Kivu. This is es sential to the ongoing work of adaptation: the integration of new social and political realities into the framework of a familiar narrative.13 Most significantly, Apted's film incorporates specific and self-reflexive rep resentations of new technologies and knowledges in documentary filming at Karisoke. This opens up the mise en scene to include technology and its role in the celebrification of Fossey and the gorillas. Filming is a specific historical act, and Apted's biopic emphasizes the presence of camera and its operator, and (controversially) the strategic and deliberate framing of the moment of con tact. In his recent memoir, the National Geographic cameraman who filmed extensively at Karisoke, Bob Campbell, claims that he initiated and choreo graphed key moments of Fossey's performance for effect. This is a reminder of the mediation and commercialization of what appears to be a profound and natural encounter motivated by its human and animal subjects. In the memoir (as we have seen), this contact is initiated spontaneously by the gorilla. Gorillas in the Mist involved Campbell as a consultant in the course of production, and it presents the "contact" narrative from his perspective. Campbell (played by Bryan Brown) is included in the scenes featuring Fossey and the gorillas, and the new lightweight synchronous sound camera is omnipresent. Apted's film presents the interaction of Fossey and the gorillas as a carefully staged display. In this way, Apted's adaptation of the memoir appropriates Fossey's account, introducing an element of reflexivity to insert the technologies and aesthetics of wildlife documentary into the framing of its subjects, both girl and gorillas, and it gestures towards the positioning of the viewer as witness.14 The casting of Sigourney Weaver as Dian Fossey in the biopic accelerated the Fossey legend and secured its ongoing transmission, affecting a conver gence of two star signs. Weaver's image becomes a reincarnation, effectively displacing Fossey visually in gorilla girl imagery (on covers of some editions</page><page sequence="12">482 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) of the memoir, for example), and enabling renewed narrative—ironically Fos sey's death and the unique affective force of her version of interspecies contact secures her preeminence over the surviving members of Leakey's trio, Goodall and Galdikas.'5 The corpus of gorilla girl material is dense with primate and human imagery, bodies and performance, as Weaver is incorporated into the frame at this point. Apted's "first contact" narrative presents Weaver who imi tates Fossey who is in turn imitating primate behavior, vocalizations, and ges ture. Gorilla girl is a celebrity composite produced by a series of remediations over several decades, its imagery sedimented in popular memory by ongo ing biographical and autobiographical representations that both celebrate and mourn this powerful transcendence of the humanist subject. These incarnations and images are now generic, unhinged from their original documentary and still photographs, and subjected to constant ad aptation across various media in a series of spaces organized and managed through Fossey's celebrity: posters, still photographs, book covers (including The focus is on Digit's face, as Fossey imitates primate behavior (Robert I. M. Campbell/National Geographic Stock). / -</page><page sequence="13">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 483 Haraway's Primate Visions), the Apted film, half a dozen print biographies, photobiography, YouTube clips, websites, a Dian Fossey Visa card, and other products now marketed (officially) through the online store associated with The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Fossey brand is the hub of heterogenous campaigns, products, and associations mediated through a ce lebrity icon for global wildlife conservation. In this narrative field both human and nonhuman primates coexist as celebrities: "Dian," "Digit," "Beethoven," and "Brahms" were born as celebrity icons and biographical subjects together, in a charismatic primal narrative that now traverses a series of mediations and confers individual "selfhood" upon the primates recognized in the documen taries. Generations of familiar/familial named gorillas are an important rhe torical strategy in campaigns organized around the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. For example, the June 2008 "Field News" from Karisoke posted at the Fos sey Fund Flome Page chronicles the Oedipal struggle of Titus and Kuryama, descendants of gorillas observed by Fossey in the original documentaries, and Titus himself is the subject of a recent documentary biopic on the occasion of his third decade of life. Primate celebrity is critical to the bonds of pleasure and identification that the audience makes with gorilla girl, and to the campaigns for animal rights featuring nonhuman primates more generally, and it shapes a powerful mode of empathie engagement for global access to the Kivu region. Fossey's practice of "active conservation," which refused to negotiate gorilla welfare in terms of the demands of commerce and industry and the new nation state, has been superseded by this highly effective campaign of what she would term "theoretical conservation," where the fate of the Virunga gorillas ener gizes the global mediascapes and ideoscapes of wildlife conservation. Predict ably, given that grief and loss are embedded in gorilla girl iconography, this narrative is empowered in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, and it taps into two markets that drive the global tourism industry vital to the Rwandan national economy: ecotourism and dark/disaster tourism.16 GENDERED VULNERABILITY It is Dian Fossey's vulnerability as a gendered subject, and the question of where and how her experiences of gendered violence become speakable in life narra tive, that return gorilla girl to Kivu. As Foucault suggests, "silence itself—the things one declines to say, or is forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between different speakers—is less the absolute limit of discourse, the other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, than an element that functions alongside the things said, with them and in relation to them" (27). A narrative of gendered violence that remains unspoken within gorilla girl lore surfaces var iously as biographical representations of Dian Fossey proliferate and extend the controversial and unstable life of Fossey as an auto/biographical subject.</page><page sequence="14">484 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) Farley Mowat, the Canadian nature writer and author of the first sub stantial biography of Fossey, is generally recognized as her most reliable bi ographer. Yet Mowat's Woman in the Mists (1987) is by no means a scholarly biography. Mowat remarks that Fossey left not only her memoir but also an extensive personal archive of correspondence and copies of her replies, her own writings published and unpublished, a comprehensive file of what was written about her, daily journals, and extensive observations (xiii). Mowat quotes from these unpublished materials indiscriminately and without ref erence. Subsequently Fossey has been the subject of numerous biographical projects in various genres.17 Like celebrity biography in general, these ac counts draw on an array of authorized and unauthorized sources to bring into view the eroticized, suffering, sexual body that is repressed in gorilla girl framings of Fossey's experience. It is in these biographies, not memoir or wildlife documentary, that traumatic experience of grief and loss are ex panded beyond a grieving for nonhuman primates into gendered suffering and violence; at this point the embodiment of gorilla girl and its relation to feminist thinking takes a new turn. From the very outset, the biographical and autobiographical accounts of Fossey's life in central Africa are contradictory and fragmentary, and it is symptomatic that it is the issue of rape and gendered violence at the hands of the Congolese militia that remains untold in authoritative accounts, unrepre sented in wildlife documentary, and yet vivid as rumor, scandal, and African depravity in biography. Georgianne Nienaber elaborates as biographical fact that Fossey was raped by Congolese militia who captured her at Kivu in 1966, and she uses the language of post-traumatic stress disorder to explain the very different public and private accounts of Fossey's life. Nienaber frames the re mainder of Fossey's life story as a trauma narrative, with memories of rape and torture responsible for her emotional instability, her hatred of African men, and her passionate devotion to the gorilla as companion species. Fossey's ref erence to this incident in her memoir is cursory and heroic, although she later cryptically remarks that she "still bore the scars of my exodus from Kabara in Zaire" ( Gorillas 126). Mowat emphasizes that Fossey's accounts in letters and affidavits about her expulsion from Kivu written in 1966 make no mention of sexual abuse; he entirely discounts the rape narrative, deeming it a racist and salacious myth (47). On the other hand, Harold Hayes offers a plausible explanation for the circulation of an account of this trauma in oral narrative: different versions of the traumatic experience were told to friends and col leagues over the years (163-64). Nienaber's version in Gorilla Dreams draws on Fossey's diaries and "emotional confessions" allegedly made to others to claim Congolese militia brutalized and caged Fossey, urinated upon her, and raped her. Fossey herself becomes a caged animal, dehumanized and presented</page><page sequence="15">Whítlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 485 for public view. Dale Peterson's recent authoritative biography of Jane Goodall also asserts that Fossey was sexually abused by the militia.18 Elsewhere the ac count becomes even more traumatic, including suggestions of cannibalism.19 Ultimately, then, tracking the transits of life narrative brings Dian Fossey and the women of Kivu together as we consider how accounts of gendered vio lence in the Congo become available to public discussion via auto/biographi cal acts. The possibility that Fossey herself was a victim of rape warfare is a re minder that in 1967, as in 2009, women are subjected to violent assault, that militia who act with impunity have now traumatized generations of women in the Kivu region, and that this suffering remains unspoken, unheard, and unseen. It indicates too that the remediation of Fossey's life narrative occurs in carefully regulated ideoscapes and mediascapes. The gorilla girl story is sub ject to adaptation and appropriation; it draws on powerful affective forces of mourning and loss to challenge speciesism and expand recognition of precari ous life, but it is not readily available to a narrative of gendered violence—not only does the gorilla girl narrative fail to recognize the presence or suffering of African women, but also, possibly, it occludes the violation of Fossey herself. This possibility is engaged in paratexts, in biographical speculation, but not in autobiographical memoir, biopic, or wildlife documentary. Fossey's celebrity as gorilla girl is, to be sure, a space of privilege, and yet it becomes increasingly clear that the coexistence of the Fossey legend and the constrained production and dissemination of humanitarian storytelling of rape warfare is symptom atic of the gendered construction of narratives that regulate identification and empathie engagement with women's lived experiences in the Congo region. These questions about the limits of what is speakable, and what can be said about gendered violence in particular, return to the conversation that set this essay in motion. The Fossey story, which circles around mourning, violence, and loss, suggests how the limits of recognition and speakability can be con tested and reconfigured to include the lives (and deaths) of animals as griev able. Experiences of gendered violence, however, remain unspeakable. THE GREATEST SILENCE In 2008 a major intervention in humanitarian storytelling about the DRC was released: Lisa F. Jackson's documentary The Greatest Silence: Rape in the Congo. Jackson's film engages specifically with these unspeakable stories of gendered violence that traumatize African women, and challenges the silences that surround rape warfare. It actively elicits women's testimony as victims of rape as a human rights abuse; it solicits the accounts of men in the militias that are perpetrators of rape warfare; and it engages with the activists who cam paign on behalf of the victims in the DRC. Jackson's documentary is critically</page><page sequence="16">486 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) acclaimed: it has been screened in prime time on the HBO network in the USA, it features in Human Rights film festivals globally, and it has been wide ly circulated and recognized in the DRC. It was, for example, shown in the Congolese National Assembly in Kinshasa, and throughout January 2009 the film was aired on Congolese National Television in three different languages (Reed). It calls for an end to impunity to rape. Jackson's film circulates now as a powerful condemnation of gendered warfare in the DRC; it places the women's testimonies in a communal context of healing and resistance that emphasizes the therapeutic effects of giving testimony; and it begins to make some response to those questions that initiate this inquiry: how networks of humanitarian storytelling might become engaged on the issue of rape warfare in the DRC now. In The Greatest Silence we might well see and hear that small group of women struggling to survive on the borderlands of Rwanda and the DRC that were the subjects of my conversation in Johannesburg. Certainly they, or those like them, are no longer spectral presences, only to be imag ined from afar. In Jackson's film, the women and children who are victims of gendered violence give testimony, and this is witnessed as they are recog nized, named, and heard, openly risking the cultural stigma that attaches to the rape victim. The contact zone of overlapping and contrary regimes and commercial exploitation across Kivu is made real as the lived experience of these women. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the film has made a substan tial impact on understandings of rape warfare in Africa more broadly (by, for example, establishing rape as an act of violence rather than desire), and it is used in feminist-inspired support networks in central Africa.20 At a site where the cultural resources available to gather the testimony of victims of rape war fare are impoverished, The Greatest Silence has extended the limits of who can speak, what can be spoken, and how it is to be heard. I watch Jackson's documentary with Fossey in mind. Here, finally, the women and children who survive rape warfare in the DRC appear. They are vivid and memorable. What specific knowledges, technologies, and aesthetics extend recognition and engage the viewer as witness here? Jackson draws on an emergent tradition of feminist documentary filmmaking on the subject of rape warfare, a specific concern of the Women Make Movies collective that distributes The Greatest Silence us part of its International Human Rights Col lection of films by and about women. This feminist initiative has sponsored a series of documentary films that focus on representations of rape warfare as a human rights violation, beginning with the atrocities that led to the identifica tion of rape warfare as a war crime: the events in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Rape warfare documentary risks a variety of feminist critiques: on the commodification of truth telling discourses and the exotic (Hesford), the limitations of human rights discourse (Grewal), and the creation of discursive</page><page sequence="17">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 487 space by and for third world woman by first world witnesses (Mohanty). Yet feminist knowledges have also created the grounds for this documentary. In considering the risks and possibilities of transnational and transcultural rhetor ical acts of witnessing on the subject of rape warfare specifically, Wendy Hes ford argues that testimonies by victims of rape warfare produce acute problems in the production and dissemination of trauma story: "I . . . use the term crisis of witnessing to refer to the risks of representing trauma and violence, ruptures in identification, and the impossibility of empathetic merging between wit ness and testifier, listener and speaker" (107). The silences that are sustained across constant remediation of Fossey's narrative confirm Hesford's point that rape warfare challenges established mediascapes, ideoscapes, and technoscapes of documentary film and humanitarian storytelling; it constitutes a distinctive and problematic situation of transnational rhetorical witnessing. Furthermore, new technology is essential to aesthetic effect in Jackson's film. The digital camera allows an intimate entry into the community of these women. Their faces fill the screen. Their eyes—"the apotheosis of the quick, the most alive and sensitive parts of the body"—gaze into the lens; voices "have textures, as though perceived tactilely and visually" (MacDou gall 52), and they speak of terrible experiences of violation and physical suf fering. These testimonies are a gift: risking the stigma of rape, these women testify, and witnesses are obligated to recognize and reciprocate. The digicam Marie Jeanne, age 34, Bukava DRC (from The Greatest Silence: copyright © 2008 Jackson Films Inc.; reproduced by permission of Lisa F. Jackson).</page><page sequence="18">488 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) is vital to this intimacy: it becomes a prosthetic device that extends Jackson's own embodied presence at the scene of testimony and witnessing; body and camera are visibly "kindred instruments" (MacDougall 29). Carried aloft on Jackson's shoulder, the camera both captures and replays testimony: the Congolese women witness their embodiment in the film. In this way, the mise en scene incorporates a complex and multilayered scene of testimonial exchange and witness in the first, second, and third person, implicating the subject, viewer, and filmmaker together. These complex auto/biographical dynamics are extended as Jackson includes her testimony as a survivor of pack rape in the USA. This implicitly authorizes her to give witness to the testimonies of Congolese women, and it emphasizes the shared gendered vul nerability of African and western women as victims of pack rape. The limits of recognition in Jackson's documentary arise in its representa tion of the men who rape: perpetrators remain unspeakable and faceless. Cap tured in dehumanizing frames of reference, these men mark the limits of who can speak and be heard in the human rights documentary. Militia emerge from the forests of Kivu to confess direct to camera to multiple and brutal acts of rape. These men are camouflaged and unnamed, and they speak without repentance, guilt, or compassion. Here a long history of Western representa tions of the Congo that engage in Africanist tropes of primitivism and mon strosity resurface in figures of depraved masculinity beyond recognition. To return to Torgovnick: this is the insidious doubling that inhabits the margins of humanitarian storytelling; these are the brutes on the margins of the text, although to be sure, the campaign for the end to impunity in the film calls for incarceration, not Kurtz's extermination of "the brutes." However, these perpetrators remain illegible, invisible and unmourned in the language and aesthetics of the documentary. The rhetorics and aesthetics of representation here ensure they make no demands for an ethical response, even though they deliberately speak not only as perpetrators but also as intimate others, con nected to the communities of women as fathers, husbands, and sons. These brutish faceless others lurching out of the forests of Kivu require that we consider "that something was possibly outside, which made the very sense of the inside possible, recognizable. . . . Something exceeds the frame that troubles our sense of reality; in other words, something occurs that does not conform to our established understanding of things" (Butler, Frames of War 9). The challenge for humanitarian storytelling on rape warfare is to imagine the humane without recourse to the species boundary that separates the human and its others. The perpetrator as unhuman other raises funda mental questions: Whose lives are real? How might this reality be remade?21 Butler's questions about what makes for a grievable life open directly into concerns about the recognition of subjects of violence and tfie speakability of</page><page sequence="19">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 489 Jackson films Congolese rapists (from The Greatest Silence-, copyright © 2008 Jackson Films, Inc.; reproduced by permission of Lisa F. Jackson). trauma in humanitarian storytelling, calling into question, for example, the binary thinking that relegates the perpetrator to unspeakability and faceless monstrosity. The "established understanding" we are called upon to reimag ine here is a thinking that refuses speciesism, and the established modes of recognition that fall from that. We bring excess baggage to any engagement with the Congo, which exists in the western imaginary as a space of brutality and excess that generates anx ious and fearful speculation on what it means to be human. At the same time, the forests of the Virunga mountains are familiar as a place of transcendence, where cross-species engagement has extended recognition to embrace nonhu man others. These very different engagements with the limits of the human frame our grasp of the geographical, historical, and social realities of Kivu now, and we must bring them together to make humane response to the endemic violence and suffering of human and nonhuman life. This is the demand that Jackson's film makes of us as viewers: our ethical obligation is to attend to these testimonies of both victim and perpetrator. For example, the presence of the digital camera, that technology that is such an effective device for captur ing testimony and initiating intimate exchange with the survivors amidst the community of women, appears very differently to others. Most specifically, it terrifies the traumatized children who are victims of rape warfare. When</page><page sequence="20">490 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) Jackson approaches, the digicam aloft on her shoulder resembles the weap ons carried on the shoulders of the militia and Congolese armed forces, and it triggers traumatic memories. In the eyes of these children of Kivu, victims, perpetrators, and benefactors are neither readily identifiable nor stable identi ties. At this point—a transient yet eloquent moment when the very presence of the camera calls the framing of the narrative into question, and Jackson be comes a witness caught amidst complex and contradictory social relations— we glimpse the limitations of humanitarian storytelling, a universal and uni versalizing template for the legitimation of suffering, which cannot parse the propinquity of the different subjects that coexist as survivors now. Here, on this most difficult subject of rape warfare, are those rendered faceless and unspeakable, caught at that point where recognition fails and we meet the silence which (to return to Foucault) functions alongside things said and in relation to them. Mahmood Mamdani argues that the true moral di lemma of the Rwandan genocide and its aftermath is the intimacy of the affair. Neither the identity of the perpetrator nor that of the victim is as transparent as we might think, and beneficiaries are few (267). As a result, he questions campaigns for punitive justice in favor of forms of transitional justice that work at local levels to reconcile both victims and perpetrators as survivors. For example, in Rwanda the community "gacaca"—local truth and reconciliation tribunals—work towards social justice and reconciliation by bringing tor mented individuals and perpetrators face to face.22 Although Mamdani makes no mention of gendered violence and rape warfare, and Jackson's campaign for an end of impunity to rape in the DRC is a powerful feminist response to women's testimony, the violence of victims-turned-perpetrators calls for the production of new frames of recognition, which reach beyond the conceptual limits of rights discourse and criminal justice to grasp the multiple and situ ated survivor testimonies that are revealed by The Greatest Silence}2' In a memorable and cautionary remark on the responsibilities of trans cultural documentary, David MacDougall comments that even as a film is being shot, its subjects are in transition, moving toward a future the film cannot contain (33). These philosophical and ethical questions about how narrated lives enter into humanitarian storytelling, and which lives become real, connect tenuously and temporarily to how we come to recognize living beings as biographical subjects. In the eastern DRC now women, men, and children struggle to survive in conditions of abject poverty, just across the border from where Dian Fossey watched the gorillas. Together the life narra tives of these living beings circle around issues of gendered violence and rape warfare, and they require that we think anew about the work of mourning and violence at the limits of the human.</page><page sequence="21">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 491 From The Greatest Silence: Rape in the Congo; copyright ©2008 Jackson Films, Inc.; reproduced by permission of Lisa F.

NOTES author's note: Versions of this work were presented at the University of Queensland, the Australian National University, the University of Adelaide, and the International Auto/ Biography Association conference at the University of Hawai'i; in each instance the feedback helped shape the argument. Conversations with Kay Schaffer and Dorothy Driver were also formative in producing this final version. Much of the work for this paper was carried out during a generous research fellowship at the Humanities Research Centre of the ANU, working alongside Rosanne Kennedy and Rosemary Jolly, the best of friends and colleagues, who know gorilla girl well. 1. This is paraphrased from David Attenborough's documentary Gorillas Revisited, where he returns to Rwanda to examine the fate of the mountain gorillas in the wake of geno cide and civil war. There is, Attenborough goes on to say, more meaning and mutual understanding with the mountain gorilla "than with any other animal I know. We see the world the same way." 2. This is the Africa of James Ferguson's Global Shadows. 3. Over a million Hutu crossed into Congo in mid-1994 as refugees that "literally brought the trauma of postgenocide Rwanda to the region of Kivu. The impact was volcanic, and its effects have yet to ebb" (Mamdani 24). 4. Mamdani remarks on the devastating effects of the armed refugee camps on civilian life in Kivu, which led to the dollarization of the economy, and the militarization of</page><page sequence="22">492 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) ordinary life: "To talk to civil society leaders in Kivu about the experience of hosting a million-plus refugees resourced through international NGOs was to listen to a litany of troubles—criminality, ill health, increased prices, lowered production, mounting insecurity—all traced to that single experience" (256). There is extensive discussion of the role of discourses of animality and the hate media in the Rwandan genocide in Thompson, Melvern, and Mamdani. In his memoir In Brightest Africa, Carl Akeley describes his first encounter with the mountain gorillas, which he perceived as both unknown and yet uniquely associated with the origins of man. Akeley improved the technology of the motion picture camera for his fieldwork with wildlife, he worked to perfect his skills as a taxidermist to capture the gorilla for display, he shot the footage of the gorillas himself, and he began the cam paign to establish a gorilla reserve at Kivu. This turn to gendered, experiential knowledge in postwar primatology is highly con tentious as scientific practice, and debates about the influence of feminism on the de velopment of primatology in North America in the 1970s continue. Fossey above all attracts critique from the scientific community for the apparent anthropomorphism of her fieldwork, although her methods imitating the actions and vocalizations of the ani mals were accepted practice as the discipline emerged in the 1960s. As Amanda Rees suggests, habituation and individualization were methodological techniques that were essential to studies of nonhuman primates, and yet these left researchers open to allega tions of inappropriate interference and intervention that alters "natural" behavior, and of failing to maintain appropriate boundaries between researcher and subjects. By the end of the decade the emerging discipline had generated an institutional infrastructure of journals and conferences, where protocols for observing yet not influencing the behavior of nonhuman primates were debated at length. Fossey was not alone in identifying the primates as research subjects, rather than objects—as beings who might be appropriate bearers of unique and individual subjectivity and history, and subjects worthy of em pathie identification across the species boundary in fieldwork. However, it was Fossey along with Biruté Galdikas and Jane Goodall who became popular celebrities and iconic figures in the popularization of scientific research, through in the first instance, the Na tional Geographic franchise that owned the rights to the powerful imagery of primate and "trimate" encounters featuring gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans. The trimates— Fossey, Galdikas, and Goodall—argued Fedigan, "broke ranks" with the discipline and challenged what counts as science by pioneering the association of primatology with conservation, legitimizing mission science as an accepted aspect of primatology (63). Leakey deliberately selected young uncredentialled women—Fossey was painfully aware that she had none of the "ologies" (ethology, zoology, biology, anthropology) required for conventional scientific research (Mowat 22). Although her research at Karisoke would later lead to a doctorate from Cambridge University, Fossey's scientific status and her approach to the primates were a constant source of controversy. For Leakey, these young women were open to the experiential and affective impact that would produce new and intimate insights into the origins of human social life. They rapidly accrued commercial value in the mass media, yet this was at some cost to their reputation as research scien tists. On the National Geographic project more generally, see Lutz and Collins. Observations that suggest degeneracy or primitivism, such as coprophagy (the subject of fascinating postcolonial analyses of Fossey's work by Lathers and Armbruster), or</page><page sequence="23">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 493 brutality (such as infanticide and cannibalism) amongst the gorillas are addressed delib erately and rationalized in Fossey's memoir Gorillas in the Mist. 10. "When I wrote Primate Visions, I think I failed the obligation of curiosity in much the same way I suggest Derrida did. I was so intent on the consequences of the Western philosophical, literary and political heritage for writing about animals—especially other primates in the so-called third world in a period of rapid decolonization and gender rearrangements—that I all but missed the radical practice of many of the biologists and anthropologists, women and men both, who helped me with the book, that is, their relentless curiosity about the animals and their tying themselves into knots to find ways to engage with these diverse animals as rigorous scientific practice and not a romantic fantasy. . . . Had I known in 1980 how to cultivate the curiosity I wanted from Derrida, I would have spent much more time at risk at field sites with the scientists and the mon keys and apes, not in the facile illusion that such ethnographic fieldwork would give the truth about people or animals where interviews and documentary analysis mislead, but as a subject-forming entanglement that requires response one cannot know in advance. I knew I cared about the actual animals then, but I knew neither how to look back nor that I lacked the habit" (313). 11. Fossey sets out two approaches to wildlife conservation. The first she calls "active conser vation," a "stringent" preservation of natural habitat by the enforcement of rigid legisla tion against human encroachment into parks and other game sanctuaries (xvii). This is the method Fossey practiced at Karisoke, and it was highly controversial. She funded and trained local people as rangers, initiated patrols to eradicate poachers from the Virunga reserves, and urged punitive action by local authorities. The absolute right of the gorillas to the reserve lands was asserted over and above the rights, interests, and traditions of local and indigenous people. Early in her memoir Fossey observes that Rwanda in the late 1960s was one of the most highly populated regions on earth. She would, however, entertain no compromise between the welfare of the gorillas, as she perceived it, and the emerging industries of the newly independent nation: tourism, pyrethrum plantations, and expanded agriculture. Negotiation with institutions and agencies such as the Of fice for Tourism and National Parks was the agenda of what Fossey called "theoretical conservation," an instrumental approach that could not save the mountain gorillas from extinction. 12. The diegesis of the memoir necessarily climaxes in the momentous touch of recognition across difference: "The first occasion when I felt I might have crossed an intangible bar rier between human and ape occurred about ten months after beginning the research at Karisoke," Fossey tells us: "Peanuts, Group 8's youngest male ... turned to stare directly at me. The expression in his eyes was unfathomable. Spellbound, I returned his gaze. . . . Jubilant, I returned to camp and cabled Dr. Leakey I'VE FINALLY BEEN AC CEPTED BY A GORILLA" (141). Two years later, Peanuts becomes the first gorilla to initiate the gift of "touch." 13. In the concluding frame of Apted's film, the African tracker and guide Sembagare effects a symbolic reunion of human and nonhuman primate as he rearranges the markers of each individual grave to produce a single site of commemoration. By this stage in the politics of African decolonization and independence, the film is required to not only enhance the familiar and pleasurable element of the gorilla girl story; it must also make more substantial ideological gestures to alert the viewer to the changed historical and</page><page sequence="24">494 Biography 33.3 (Summer 2010) political realities of Karisoke. So it is that an African character produces this final sym bolic gesture of memorialization, and by implication, gives indigenous consent to the seductive reformulation of gendered and racialized identity in gorilla girl mythography. The trope of the African guide as a sign of cross-generational transmission is familiar. As we have seen, Fossey was encouraged by the presence of precursors: Akeley's remains at her first Kivu site, the memoir that recorded Schaller's earlier occupation, and the presence of Sanwekwe, the guide who took the three generations of American research ers to the Virunga gorillas. The Apted film is a reminder of the gendered and racialized presence of African people in the gorilla girl mythography, and it extends the trope to function in the work of commemoration that drives the remediation of the Fossey story at this point. 14. The distinction between adaptation and appropriation here draws on Julie Sanders: "appropriation carries out the same sustained engagement as adaptation but frequently adopts a posture of critique, even assault" (4). 15. Weaver was an inspired choice: she brought into the Fossey legend her established ce lebrity identity as Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, the strong female lead of Ridley Scott's Alien franchise. Subliminally at least, associations of the Alien narrative—a plot that focuses on liminal spaces outside of human civilization and posthuman life forms in the sci fi genre—reinforces Weaver's appearance as Fossey. 16. For example, in a blurb from the travel pages of the San Francisco Chronicle m 2006, we see how the Fossey story is seamlessly incorporated into these post-genocide landscapes where human remains and "ecologically sensitive" wildlife occupy a single frame: Even the violent past is accessible. The Rwandan tourist office suggests that visitors see at least one of the hundreds of genocide memorials scattered throughout the country. The Kigali Memorial Centre, for instance, is on any city tour. It is a burial ground for some 250,000 victims of the genocide, and also a museum. But the primary draw for tourists is still the green northwest, the region that surrounds the volcanoes and the Pare National des Volcans. In this area are a half-dozen newly built or renovated hotels, including at least two high-end ecotourist lodges. Tour companies offer volcano trekking, bird watching and trips to Dian Fossey's grave; artisan cooperatives sell carvings and baskets and hand-painted T-shirts. A beekeeping association even touts hand-packaged, gorilla-safe Virungas honey—made from ecologically sensi tive beehives on the edge of the park. And, of course, there are the gorillas themselves. (Hanes) 17. For example, photobiography (Mathews), biographies for preadolescent readers (Nadin, Mara), journalistic biography (Hayes), and a life told through letters (de la Bédoyère). 18. "Jane learned also on September 5 that Dian Fossey (along with her two chickens, Lucy and Desi) had been forcibly evacuated from her camp at the Virunga volcanoes. She had been taken down to park headquarters at Rumangabo, imprisoned, and 'earmarked,' as she later phrased it, for the personal attentions of an important military general. She was put on display in a cage, urinated and spat upon, and probably raped" (424). 19. Fossey "did tell Biruté Galdikas and Louis Leakey that she had been held in a cage and repeatedly raped, spat on and urinated on, and that later she was put in a cage with some white men all of whom were murdered. Fifty kilometers from where Fossey was</page><page sequence="25">Whitlock, Remediating Gorilla Girl 495 held eighteen white people were eaten alive" (Jahme 66). In a review of Jahme's book this becomes: "Dian Fossey was kidnapped, raped repeatedly and urinated upon before being locked in a cage with 18 dead men" (O'Connell 1). 20. These anecdotal insights into the uses of Jackson's film in woman-centered support net works emerged in discussions about the film at the "Beyond Reconciliation" conference at the University of Cape Town, 2-6 December 2009. For an example of how Jackson's film has embedded in the popular press in Africa an understanding of war rape as not about sex, but about power, terror, and domination, see Liwanga. For a thoughtful discussion of ethics and responsibility in depicting survivors of sexual violence, see Aric Mayer's media policy document written for HEAL Africa, a Congolese-led program based in the DRC. 21. For a discussion that problematizes the boundary between victim and perpetrator so es sential to human rights campaigns, see SchafFer and Smith, and Payne. 22. For a discussion of Rwandan digital testimony that draws on indigenous traditions, see Broderick. 23. Sarkar and Walker take up this issue of the countervailing processes that unfold as lo cal testimonial archives are assembled into global networks. On the one hand, archives adopt broader languages and frameworks to address translocal publics; on the other hand, universal concerns such as human rights and social justice are constantly reca librated in their encounter with local contexts: "The political efficacy of a testimonial apparatus is determined in the constant negotiation between universalizing norms and local imperatives" (21).
