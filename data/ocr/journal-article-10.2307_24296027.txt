<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Classic Is Born: The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter Walter Sauer Introduction Although Heinrich Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter (also known in English as Struwelpeter, Strewelpeter, Slovenly Peter, Shock-Headed Peter, Tousle-Headed Peter, or Scruffypete!) has received considerable at tention worldwide within the past several years, most studies have suffered from a lack of precise knowledge concerning its genesis and l. While the alternative and phonetic spellings "Struwelpeter" and "Strewel peter" occur variously in different English language editions of the book, the title "Slovenly Peter" is first found in the 1849 American English version, Slovenly Pe ter; Pleasant Stories and Funny Pictures. Translatedfrom the German (New York: C. Town, 1849). "Shock-Headed Peter" was the name given to the "Struwwelpeter" figure in the first (anonymous) English translation (1848 ff.), whose title was, how ever, The English Struwwelpeter (Leipzig: Volckmar, 1848). "Tousle-Headed Pe ter" is used for a modern American English translation by Evan K. Gibson, pub lished in Walter Sauer, ed., Heinrich Hoffmann: Der Struwwelpeter polyglott (Miinchen: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 1984). The latest name appears in Ann Wild's English version contained in Shock-Headed Peter in Latin-English German.

The present article intends to review crit ically the available evidence for Struwwelpeter^, early years, while rein terpreting some old facts and offering new insights regarding the making and shaping of this mid-nineteenth century children's classic. For the present purpose, I shall apply the metaphorical meaning of "childhood" in my title to cover the book's first fifty years ending with Hoffmann's death in 1894. My exclusive focus will be on original German editions. Struwwelpeter's "Prenatal Phase" Der Struwwelpeter is among those books possessing an established and received "mythology" connected with their origins. With other children's books, such as Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe (written for "Lyte Lowys my sone"), Louis Ratisbonne's Come'die enfantine, Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, Kornei Chukovskii's nonsense "epics," and A. A. Milne's or Astrid Lindgren's children's books, it shares the characteristic of hav ing purportedly been written for immediate members of the author's family, usually his or her son or daughter. As a rule, such stories are based on biographical sources provided by the authors themselves. Hoffmann, too, has left us personal accounts of "how [he] came to write Struwwelpeter."3 The first of these is an article published in the magazine Die Garten laube in 1871.4 It claims to be based on an interview with Heinrich Hoff mann, whom its anonymous author quotes at length about the history of the book.5 Extracts from this essay preface most German and English editions issued by Riitten &amp;Loening after 1876. There can be no doubt that both Hoffmann and his publishers sanctioned this account.6 Over 2.

It agrees word for word with much of the somewhat shorter second Gartenlaube essay, and appears to have been its source. Together, these three documents have become fa vorite sources for Struwwelpeter's interesting "literary biography." While there is no a priori reason to doubt the reliability of these sources, writ ten or at least sanctioned by the author himself, the fact that all three were written at a considerable distance from the book's first appear ance — 26 or even 48 years respectively — might suggest that some of the details need revision in the light of other information. A critical review of the individual elements of the "mythology" surrounding the origin of Struwwelpeter WAX help us to separate fact from fiction. The most important feature of the established tradition is that Hoff mann wrote and illustrated the Struwwelpeter stories for his three-year old son Carl10 as a Christmas present in 1844. Although Hoffmann's manuscript lacks an inscription to that effect,11 the basic facts connected 7. The letter is signed "Dr. H. Hoffmann-Donner." Towards the end of his life, Hoffmann occasionally added his wife's maiden name to his own. 8. The article is signed by F. S., who claims to be from North Germany and to have met Hoffmann as a fellow student in Heidelberg. I have found only one north German student with these initials in Heidelberg during the time Hoffmann studied there (1829-31), Franz Schroeder, a law student from Rehberg in Mecklenburg (cf. GustavToepke and Paul Hintzelmann, eds., Die Matrikel der Universitcit Heidel berg, 5. Teil (1807-1846), [Heidelberg: Winter, 1904]). He is, however, quite un likely to have been the author. The north German interviewer-narrator of the article may well have been invented by the anonymous journalist as a literary device. 9.

The dates for Hoffmann's memoirs are usually given as 1889-91. The fact that in connection with Struwwelpeter Hoffmann speaks of "47 years" after its publication (Hessenberg, 109) indicates, however, that he was still work ing on them in 1892. 10. Carl Philipp Hoffmann (*8 May 1841, + 1868). 11. For a description of the Ms., see below.</page><page sequence="5">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 219 with this story seem to be beyond doubt. That the book was intended as a Christmas gift is obvious from the dedicatory page, whose pictures and verses are directly related to the Christchild and Christmas pres ents. Also, Hoffmann repeatedly mentions his son's name in conjunc tion with Struwwelpeter. We first encounter this information in a letter that Hoffmann wrote to a friend, the composer Ferdinand Hiller (1811 85), within weeks of the publication of the book.12 In it, he states that his "latest 'opus' has been a children's book, which Lowenthal has just published...and which [he] had originally drawn and rhymed for [his] son."13 This is also confirmed in other correspondence, such as a letter written to his friend Friedrich Ludwig Krahmer in 1847, in which he calls his "Struwwelpeterei" a "chance family frolic" for his son.14 In the 1893 Gartenlaube article he also remembers sadly that he lost his "oldest son, for whom [he] had written the book," to yellow fever in Lima, Peru, at the age of 27.15 As far as the date for the manuscript is concerned we are on equally safe ground, since the year 1844 is shown on the cover of the manu script.16 Furthermore, evidence for a terminus ante quem of January 1845 is supported by an entry in the minutes of the Frankfurt "Tutti Frutti" Society, which mentions that during the 18 January 1845 meeting their founding member Hoffmann earned the highest praise for presenting "self-written and self-illustrated children's fables."17 This can only refer 12. The letter, started on 26 November 1845 and completed "after four weeks" ("vier Wochen spater"), is to be found among Hiller's papers kept at the City Archives in Cologne, Germany. The section pertaining to Struwwelpeter dates from December. The letter has been published in Reinhold Sietz, Aus Ferdinand Hillers Briefwechsel. Beitrdge zu einer Biographie Ferdinand Hillers.

It is therefore certain that we can accept this part of the tradition as equally factual. The exact circumstances of how Hoffmann came to write the Struw welpeter stories are, however, more difficult to verify. In any case, they make a good story: the Frankfurt doctor scoured the local bookstores without finding an appropriate children's book for his son and brought home an empty notebook, telling his amazed wife, "there is what you wished for the little one.. .we are going to make a book out of it." After completing the work in his free time "the book was bound [and] put under the Christmas-tree."18 Since all three sources essentially agree on the account, it would seem hard to question its validity. Yet, a closer look at both Hoffmann's writings and other sources suggests that there may be some elaboration involved. The first case in point comes from the 1871 Gartenlaube article, which tells us that in 1844, when he wrote Struwwelpeter, Hoffmann was "the medical man of the lunatic asylum...and obliged to practice in town." Hoffmann's biography, however, rules out this possibility. His connec tion with the Frankfurt "Irrenhaus" clearly dates from a later time, namely 1851, when he assumed the position of its director — without ever hav ing set foot into it.19 Rather, between 1844 and 1851 Hoffmann was a lec turer in anatomy at the "Dr. Senckenbergisches Institut," a renowned mu nicipal foundation housing a hospital and a medical school. It was located in "Bleichstrasse," only a few blocks from his house on "Mainkai."20 We the genesis of Struwwelpeter, cf. Gerhard Evers, "Entstand der 'Struwwelpeter' im Kreis der 'Tutti Frutti'?"

"Ich hatte vorher die Anstalt nie betreten" (Hessenberg, 132). 20. Ulrich Wiedmann kindly gave me valuable information on Frankfurt's to pography in the nineteenth century. For Hoffmann's 1844 address "an dem Main kai," cf. City Archives, Frankfurt am Main, Birth records 1844, no. 1069,11. Dec. 1844.</page><page sequence="7">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 221 are thus led to conclude that Hoffmann's memory was unreliable in this instance, and to wonder whether his "literary imagination" might have influenced his accounts of other particulars. This may well be the case concerning the actual evolution of the 1844 manuscript. Hoffmann himself admits that "some of the stories, espe cially the main hero, grew on practical soil,"21 namely at the bedsides of screaming little patients whom he had difficulty in examining: "On such occasions a slip of paper and a pencil generally came to my assistance. A story, such as you find written here, invented on the spur of the moment, illustrated with a few touches of the pencil and humourously related, will calm the little antagonist, dry his tears and allow the medical man to do his duty. In this manner most of the following absurd stories origi nated. Some of them were later inventions."22 Similar accounts are found both in Hoffmann's 1893 Gartenlaube article and, in identical wording, his memoirs.23 This in itself would suggest a somewhat more complex genesis of Hoffmann's original manuscript than the one suggested by the "Christmas present story." Further evidence for this comes from a document published considerably earlier than the three sources men tioned. In 1851, Hoffmann's publishers Riitten and Lowenthal24 sued the 21. "ein und das andere war doch auf praktischem Boden gewachsen, so na mentlich der Hauptheld" (Hoffmann, "Vom Struwwelpeter," 17). 22. Cf. F. S. 769: "Da half mir gewohnlich rasch ein Blattchen Papier und Blei stift; eine der Geschichten, wie sie in diesem Buche stehen, wird rasch erfunden, mit drei Strichen gezeichnet, und dazu moglichst lebendig erzahlt. Der wilde Op positionsmann wird ruhig, die Thranen trocknen, und der Arzt kann spielend seine Pflicht tun. So entstanden die meisten dieser tollen Scenen, und ich schopfte sie aus vorhandenem Vorrathe\ Einiges wurde spater dazu erfunden" (Note the italicized passage \and I took itfrom the existing supply\ absent from the English translation). 23. "Da nahm ich rasch das Notizbuch aus der Tasche, ein Blatt wird heraus gerissen, ein kleiner Bube mit dem Bleistift schnell hingezeichnet und nun erzahlt, wie sich der Schlingel nicht die Haare, nicht die Nagel schneiden lafit; die Haare wachsen, die Nagel werden langer, aber immer lafit er sich dieselben nicht schneiden, und immer langer zeichne ich Haare und Nagel, bis zuletzt von der ganzen Figur nichts mehr zu sehen ist als Haarstrahne und Nagelklauen" — "Then I would quickly take a notebook out of my pocket, tear a page out, draw with a pencil a small boy, and relate how this rascal doesn't let his hair and finger nails be cut. The hair grows, the fingernails become longer and longer, but he still refuses to let them be cut, and I draw hair and nails longer and longer, until noth ing more can be seen of the whole figure but a shock of hair and claws." (Hoffmann, "Vom Struwwelpeter," 18). 24.

As a result, Scholz lost one of the first copyright cases fought in Germany,25 was sentenced to a fine of 1,040 gulden, had to pay a considerable sum (127 gulden) in court costs, and had to destroy all lithographic plates and books as yet unsold. While Hoffmann, in Gar tenlaube 1893 and his memoirs26 mentions this court case as a humorous episode from the comfortable vantage point of a witness for the prose cution, which won the case, the defendant apparently felt so deeply wronged that he published an account in book form (105 pp.) justifying his action and describing the court proceedings in detail.27According to this document, some of the witnesses commented on the origin of Struwwelpeter. One of them, Jakob Becker, a Frankfurt painter, and like Riitten and Lowenthal a member of the Frankfurt circle of the Tutti Frutti, made the following statement: "I know the origin of the work, which Hoffmann first showed me in separate sheets. I liked them im mensely for the intended purpose and I encouraged him to publish them."28 This strongly suggests that at least some of the stories actually had a life before the 1844 Holiday season and were incorporated into the final product of the manuscript. Hoffmann's own statement made under oath before the court29 also clashes with his later pronouncements and 25. In 1847 Riitten had already sued a Niirnberg publisher, Schmitt Brothers, for printing Struwwelpeter on broadsheets ("Bilderbogen"); cf. Christian Scholz.

Hessenberg, 110: "The court decided not to swear me in" — "Das Gericht beschlofi, mich nicht zu</page><page sequence="10">224 Bibliographical Society of America stresses that the book came into being in a gradual and additive way: "The book was originally intended for my own children and the drawings were made first; later I collected the leaves and added a text as an explana tion. Several friends who saw them encouraged me to publish them, and thus I sold them to the Literarische Anstalt of Riitten in Frankfurt."30 The fact that Hoffmann here insists that the drawings preceded the verses is clearly related to the main issue of the case. Since existing copy right laws protected the artistic but not the literary contents of translat ed books, the court had to decide whether the texts or the illustrations were the more important parts of the work.31 Hoffmann's own recollection confirms that the pictures were "the most important and the original part of the stories"32 and stresses that "the pictures originated first, mostly by the bedsides of sick and crying children, the text was added later."33 Unfortunately also, even an examination of Hoffmann's original manu script34 cannot assure us that the stories were indeed written and drawn vereidigen.")) is clearly false as can be seen from Scholz, 50 (".. .dafi Grofiherzogl. Obergericht einen Zeugen, welcher von den neuen Ausgaben des deutschen Stru welpeter noch jetzt ein Honorar erhalt, trotz diesseitigen Widerspruchs vernom men und vereidet hat. Es ist dies der Verfasser dieses Werkes, Dr. Hofmann [!]" — "...that the Supreme Court of the Grand Duchy in spite of this party's objection questioned and swore in a witness who still obtains royalties for the new editions of the German Struwwelpeter. He is the author of this work, Dr. Hof mann [!]"). 30. "Das Buch war urspriinglich fur meine eigenen Kinder bestimmt, und die Zeichnungen waren zuerst entstanden, spater sammelte ich die einzelnen Blatter und machte einen Text dazu zur Erldarung.

"...sind die Bilder zuerst enstanden, meist an den Krankenbetten unruhiger und weinender Kinder, der Text wurde spater dazu geschrieben." (Hessenberg, 111). The case is further complicated by the fact that Hoffmann in 1871 maintained that the verses preceded the pictures ("die Bilder wurden mit derselben Feder und Tinte gezeichnet, mit der ich erst die Reime geschrieben hatte" — "the pictures were drawn with the same pen and ink, with which I had first written the verses"), which at least for the final product of his manuscript is entirely unbelievable, since the text clearly fits into spaces left in the illustrations. 34.

In its present state, the book consists of single pages, which were later joined together with linen strips. This may, of course, be due to the book having been taken apart during the lithographing and coloring processes to be rebound at a later date, but it does remind us of Jacob Becker's statement that Hoffmann had shown him his "work in progress" in individual sheets, and of Hoff mann's own assertion. In the midst of this conflicting evidence we are again left with the somewhat uneasy feeling that we cannot entirely rely on what Hoff mann tells us about the development of the book. Our skepticism even leads us to wonder whether most other elements of his account, such as the shopping spree through Frankfurt's bookstores, his frustration at what they offered in children's books, his purchase of a notebook, the ensuing conversation with his wife and the painstaking work on the manuscript during the Advent season, are not part of a general fiction intended to create a pleasant "mythology" surrounding the origin of the book. In summing up the evidence it seems that while the original manu script was indeed a gift for his son in 1844, we are no longer able to reconstruct the precise circumstances and stages of its obviously com posite evolution. Struwwelpeter Is Born Hoffmann's original Struwwelpeter manuscript of 1844 (Ms. 1) has come down to us through a lucky set of circumstances.35 After having served as a Christmas present and a conversation piece in Hoffmann's circle of friends and relatives, it was given to his publishers and later ended up with the coloring firm of Peter Carl Geifiler36 in Niirnberg. Not having been 35- For the history of the manuscript cf. G. A. E. Bogeng, ed., Das Struwwel peter-Manuskript des Dr. Heinrich Hoffmann. Originalgetreue Nachbildung der Urhandschrift. (Frankfurt am Main: Riitten &amp; Loening, 1925), 23; and Heinrich Hoffmann-Museum, Das Urmanuskript, 52. 36. It is not known when Geifiler's firm started coloring Struivwelpeter books. Between 1845 and 1851, possibly longer, the coloring was done in Mainz (cf. Scholz, 2, n. 2). Hand-colored Struivwelpeter editions are found until the end of the century, witness Hoffmann's account that "the coloring by stencils is done by a group of young girls in a town in the 'Rheingau'" ("das Kolorieren durch Schab lonen besorgt eine Schar von Madchen in einem Orte im Rheingau"; Hoffmann, "Vom Struwwelpeter," 18). As Hans Ries has discovered, the coloring firm during</page><page sequence="12">226 Bibliographical Society of America reclaimed by the publisher, it remained there until 1902, when Geifiler's son Rudolf, himself an artist and illustrator of children's books, rediscov ered it in the firm's archives and gave it to the Germanisches National museum in Niirnberg, where it has been kept since. Two facsimiles of Ms. 1 have been issued: In 1925, Riitten &amp; Loening printed a bibliophile edition limited to 550 copies, which was accompanied by a brochure con taining Hoffmann's account "Wie der Struwwelpeter entstand" and an essay by G. A. E. Bogeng.37 More recently, the Heinrich-Hoffmann-Mu seum of Frankfurt am Main in cooperation with the Germanisches Na tionalmuseum, Niirnberg made the manuscript available again in fac simile form, adding an extensive afterword.38 While both books afford us the opportunity of comparing the early printed editions with their source, a detailed description of the manuscript has never been undertaken. Ms. Germanisches Nationalmuseum Niirnberg 1000921 (L.1780 v) is a slim volume measuring 21.8 x 17.5 cm. bound in boards covered with marbled teal blue paper. Its spine and corners are in maroon red leather like material. A beige leaf each (approx. 19 x 15 cm.) has been pasted onto the front and back covers, exposing a narrow teal and red margin (max. 1.5 cm.). While the front shows a lithographed battle scene in volving attacking cavalry, charging infantry and dying soldiers, the leaf on the back cover contains a war song in four numbered stanzas rhym ing aabccb ("Schon ist's unter freiem Himmel..."). As the identical floral and cornucopia design used as marginal decoration indicates, both leaves must have the same provenance, and judging from their subject matter must indeed be complementary.39 The oblong picture is mounted verti that time was that of P. Krahn in Erbach near Mainz; cf. Hans Ries, Illustration und Illustratoren des Kinder- und Jugendbuchs im deutschsprachigen Raum 1871—1914 (Osnabriick: Wenner, 1992), 265, n. 8. 37.

In 1799 Christian Gottlob Eidenbenz (1762-99) set it to music. It first appeared in Taschenbuch fur Freunde des Gesanges (Stuttgart, 1796), 149, and was thereafter reprinted in some 80 songbooks and on 20 broadsheets (Personal com munication by Waltraut Linder-Beroud, Deutsches Volksliedarchiv, Freiburg, Germany). Unfortunately, I have been unable to find the artist of the picture. Its date is quite uncertain, but a general mid-nineteenth century date seems plausible. Cf.

It also bears the library stamp "Germanisches Nationalmuseum" and the call number, as well as a handwritten inscrip tion, possibly in Hoffmann's own hand, reading "Drollige Geschichten und lustige Bilder." The date "1844" appearing below the picture, now towards the right margin, is partially cut off, which indicates that the leaf was trimmed when it was glued onto the board. The present binding thus cannot have been the original one, but must represent a later book binder's attempt at gathering the remains of Hoffmann's manuscript. Whether the two pasted-on leaves, with contents not exactly suitable for a three-year-old, constituted the original binding, or indeed the out er leaves of Hoffmann's alleged "notebook," we are no longer able to verify. In its present state, Ms. 1 is made up of 16 leaves measuring 21 x 16.7 cm. The front and end flyleaves, which are included in this count, are more recent than the actual manuscript and agree in paper quality and color with the pastedowns. Undoubtedly they were added to the manuscript when the book was bound in its final form. In all, there are 14 original leaves, the first and last (f. 1* and f. 13*) being blank and unnumbered.40 Numbering starts on the first written page ("Wenn die Kinder artig sind..."), f. 1*. In addition, ff. 1, and 7 to 12 have a green mark resembling a plus sign next to the number. With the exception of f. 7", all rear sides of the leaves are blank. As mentioned before, all individual leaves have been tipped to gether quite crudely with linen to make them suitable for binding. In some cases the strips used cover part of the illustrations. The combination of leaves also applies to f. 6 and f. 7, which form the central fold of the book, although their contents do not belong together.41 Several pages show tears, the bigger ones being repaired by means of paper strips on the verso. There is considerable soiling to the pages, especially along the outer and lower margins.The writing is in brownish green ink and the watercolor ing is neatly executed. All illustrations were first drawn in pencil and the lines later redone in ink. To all appearance this was done when the col oring had been completed. Hence, contrary to Hoffmann's later claim, there is absolutely no sign of the water colors running into the ink.42 4-0. For a pencil drawing on f. i*v, see below. 41. See below. 42.

"Der Struwwel-Peter" ("Shockheaded Peter"): f. i2r.44 The tales' numbering is executed in Roman numerals in the first two stories, the following one has a Roman written over an originally Arabic number, whereas the last three are numbered in Arabic style. A closer look at some of the stories in manuscript form sheds inter esting light on the iconographic and textual composition process. A case in point is given by two scenes in "Frederick." F. 3' shows the dog biting Frederick's leg, followed by f. 4r with the doctor standing at the foot of the culprit's bed. In both pictures the manuscript pages have been visibly tampered with by means of a sharp utensil. This was done in order to erase an original heavy flow of red blood gushing out of Frederick's uplifted leg and later trickling out from under his bedclothes onto the floor. The same can be seen in "Conrad," whose clipped thumb originally shed quite a bit of blood. Again, this was erased leaving a clear mark on the paper (f. nr).45 Thus at some stage Hoffmann's liberal use of 43- Fragmentary, see below. 44. The German titles are given in their actual wording and spelling as they occur in the manuscript, the English translation following the German original exactly. For practical purposes, the English abbreviations used in this article for the indi vidual stories are reminiscent ot the German titles and names: Struwwelpeter, Fred erick, Pauline, Black Boys, Wild Hunter, Conrad, Caspar, Philip, Johnny, Robert. 45. It is interesting to note that none of the early printed versions include the gory detail of Frederick's blood continuing its flow even in bed, but all of them as a rule show at least some blood in the scenes of Frederick being bitten and Conrad being deprived of his left thumb.</page><page sequence="15">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 229 hemorrhaging must have met with disapproval. We may speculate on who was responsible for these corrections and why they were carried out. Ulrich Wiedmann, who was the first to point out this manuscript detail,46 maintains that it must have been Hoffmann himself who took the bite out of the pictures, and offers three equally plausible reasons. First, that Hoffmann may have done so prior to offering the book to his son because he realized that the use of blood was slightly exaggerated for his three-year-old; second, that Hoffmann's publisher may have ad vised a reduction of the bleeding; and third, that little Carl was so upset by the pictures, that his father took a razor (or his scalpel) and reestablished peace in the family by erasing the cause of poor Carl's hysterical reaction.47 Another interesting observation concerns two textual changes in the manuscript. Beside a few corrections of minor slips of the pen, these occur in "Conrad" and in the title to "Struwwelpeter" (see Illus. 3-a). Both alterations have to do with the respective protagonists' names and are obviously interrelated. We note that originally Hoffmann did not assign his last figure a first name but only called him "Das Struwwel und Nagelkind" ("Shock-headed and Nail Child"). The idea to rename him "Struwwel-Peter" must have occurred to the author in the course of his work. He struck out the words "und Nagelkind" and replaced them with "Peter," and changed the neuter form of the definite article, "das," into the masculine "der." When adding the verses below the picture, he identified the boy by his now familiar name. It was a lucky change since the name soon came to serve as a catchy title for the book as a whole. The word "Struwwel-Peter" itself, incidentally, was not of Hoffmann's invention. It existed as a nickname well before Hoffmann's day, and reportedly was in its High German form "Strubbelpeter" at one time even applied to Goethe during his student years in Leipzig 1765-8.48 46.

It took him but four strokes of the pen to delete the name "Peter" from his already completed "Story of the Thumb-Sucker" and to replace it with "Konrad." The "Wild Hunter" consists of four different scenes taking up ff. 7 and 8 in the manuscript. In this tale, Hoffmann experienced the greatest difficulty in distributing the verses, 36 lines in all, within his illustrations. This is apparent even at the beginning of the story, where the title is set very close to the top, and the first 8 lines are set in 3 different places on the page. In the last scene, however, there was not enough room to accom modate 14 lines of verse needed to cover the events. Noticing the problem after having written the first 4 lines, Hoffmann resorted to using the emp ty facing page (f. 7"), where he continued the story with the last 10 lines. As mentioned above, ff. 6 and 7, now connected in the central fold of the manuscript, did not originally belong together. Their chance combi nation is rather due to the loss of two pictures from the "Black Boys," showing Nicolas dunking the three culprits into the inkwell, and the three inky boys marching behind the "black-a-moor" in the final scene. Whether this loss occurred prior to, or after, the binding of the manu script in its present form we are unable to say.49 It is also interesting to note that the "Struwwelpeter" illustration (f. i2r) shows several childish pencil marks across the boy's face and body, quite typical of a well read children's book. Could they represent little Carl Hoffmann's first spontaneous reaction to the abominable hair and nail child? According to Hoffmann's assertion the "Struwwelpeter" figure was set at the end of his hand-made book, mainly because there was only one empty leaf left, which he was at a loss to fill.50 A slight correction 49- For this reason, the two facsimile editions take the relevant pages from an early printed edition. Whereas the 1987 facsimile issued by the Heinrich-Hoff mann-Museum includes them as pp. 21 and 23, the Rutten &amp; Loning reprint of 1925 shows the two pictures on a separate double leaf laid into the book. 50. "Als das Buch fertig war bis auf das letzte Blatt, da war aber auch mein Bilderschatz zu Ende. Was sollte ich auf dies letzte leere Blatt bringen? Ei nun, da setzen wir den Struwwelpeter hin! So geschah es" — "When the book was com pleted up to the last leaf, my treasure of pictures was exhausted. What was I to put onto the last leaf? Oh well, we'll put Struwwelpeter on it. That is what happened" (Hoffmann, "Vom Struwwelpeter," 18).</page><page sequence="18">232 Bibliographical Society of America seems to be in order here. In fact, as a close collation shows, two more original leaves follow the "Thumb-Sucker," of which the last one (f. 13*) remained blank. "Struwwelpeter" appears on f. i2r. Ms. Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nurnberg 1000921 also in cludes three separate loose leaves connected with the history of Struw welpeter. All three are of water color paper different from and thicker than the one used in the bound manuscript. They have a modern num bering. Two of them represent original manuscript pages by Hoffmann, one showing the "Die Geschichte vom Fliegenden Robert" ("The Story of Flying Robert," f. 1), the other the final page (of three) from "Die Geschichte von Hanns Guck-in-die-Luft" ("The Story of Johnny Look-in-the air," f. 3). Both stories were added to the Struwwelpeter canon from its fifth edition onward.51 F. 2 is a variant of the "Struwwel peter" figure, with a longer and more disheveled shock of hair than in the original version, raised (not lowered) hands with long fingernails, and pantaloons showing below the hem of the skirt. Scissors and comb as the figure's attributes are set under the elbows rather than beside the head (see Illus. 4-a). It is doubtful that this picture, which generally displays a finer artistic quality than the others, can be attributed to Hoffmann himself. This alternative "Struwwelpeter" version shows that quite early during the publishing history of the book, Hoffmann or his publishers started to experiment with the figure. The leaves are of un even size, measuring between 21.7 x 19.3 cm. (f. 1), 23.5 x 19 cm. (f. 2), and 24.1-23.0 x 19.5 cm. (f. 3). They are now mounted behind passe partouts, but, as can easily be seen from the creases, were once folded in the mid dle, and thus made to fit into the now empty red pocket (21.5 x 13 cm.) of leather-like material attached to the inside of the back cover of the manu script. It would appear that the bookbinder, finding the three indepen dent leaves with what remained of the original 1844 manuscript, decided to include them separately rather than bound in the book itself.52 51. See below. 52. Beside the two missing pages from "Johnny," the original drawings from "Philip" and "Pauline," both of which predate "Johnny" and "Robert" (1846), may also have been included in this pocket.

As mentioned above, the minutes of the 18 January 1845 meeting report on the enthusiastic reception, Hoffmann's "self-written and self-illus trated children's fables" received at their first appearance outside the family. They go on to say that the secretary, or "Wishnu" (nicknamed "Spargel/asparagus"), euphorically praised Hoffmann's ("Zwiebel/on ion") work to the extent of elevating him almost to the rank of Buddha, and decided to publish it "for the benefit and profit of all 5 continents."58 "Asparagus" was an old acquaintance of Hoffmann's from his student days in Heidelberg (1829—31), the publisher Zacharias Lowenthal (1810 84), a native of Ladenburg near Heidelberg.59 Together with his associ ate Joseph Riitten he had founded a publishing house in Frankfurt only six months before, called "Literarische Anstalt (J.

At his urging, Hoffmann sold the manuscript to him for 80 gulden, the exact sum he still owed to Carl Konitzer, the owner of the "Jagersche Buchhandlung" in Frankfurt, for printing his comedy "Die Mondziigler" two years before.60 Thus, he later said of himself, "that night, at 11 o'clock, I had, almost without knowing what I had done, suddenly become an author of juvenile books."61 Growing Years: 1845-1859 What appeared on the Frankfurt book market in October 1845 as "Lu stige Geschichten und drollige Bilder mit 15 schon kolorirten Tafeln fur Kinder von 3 6 Jahren"62 issued by the "Literarische Anstalt," was a close reproduction of Hoffmann's manuscript, both with regard to the illustrations and verses, and the order of its constituent parts. The book consisted of 15 leaves printed on one side only. Two printing processes were involved in the production: while the illustrations were printed from lithographic plates, the text was typeset and printed in a second step. The pictures were colored by hand by means of stencils. Of this first edition no more than eight complete copies are known to have survived.63 They are found in the following collections: Stadt- und Universitatsbibliothek Frankfurt am Main, Germany Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University, New Haven, CT New York Public Library, New York, NY 60.

Whether the suggestion to publish the manuscript of the "pretty picture book" (Preface) did indeed come as a total surprise to its author, we are not able to say. But since Hoffmann was no newcomer to the literary scene, it may well be that even in the process of composition there was some intention at publication in volved. After a volume of poems (1842) and the comedy "Die Mondziigler" (1843), the "Lustige Geschichten and drollige Bilder" was to be his third book. 62. See below. 63. Cf.

It pre sents the book as "six fairy tales with pretty pictorial decor,"67 naming and partially summarizing each of the stories. In its final line we are introduced to the author and artist, "Who drew and wrote all this in a fine way."68 He figures anonymously as "Derlustige Reimerich Kinderlieb."69 According to Hoffmann, the close correspondence between his manu script and the published version is due to his careful supervision of the lithographer and his (Hoffmann's) revision of each lithographic plate to make sure that the lithographer followed his model meticulously, "lest he improved [his] dilettantish figures artistically and strayed into the ideal."70 In general this applies to most details of the illustrations including the 64. I have examined the Frankfurt, Beinecke, Harvard, Pierpont Morgan, and Cotsen copies. In 1933, Hofer still speaks of "only four complete copies left in the world to-day" (Philip Hofer, "A first edition of Struwelpeter," Bulletin of The New York Public Library 37 (1933): 5. Walter Schatzki knew six copies, four of which had gone through his hands (see letter entered on Jan 15,1959, contained in the slipcase holding the Beinecke first edition). So far, descriptions of the early editions of Struwwelpeter have relied entirely on the Frankfurt copies. The inclusion of other copies in my research has lead to several interesting new results; see below. 65. Not all of the extant copies have the front cover. Beinecke and Cotsen lack them. 66.

It is a blend between "Reimer" and "Heinrich" and phonetically clearly recalls Hoffmann's first name, which in Hoffmann's native Hessian dialect is often pronounced with an epenthetic vowel as "Heinerich." 70. Hoffmann, "Vom Struwwelpeter," 18.</page><page sequence="23">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 237 coloring.71 In comparing the two versions a few alterations, however, do catch the eye. They deserve a closer examination. In the manuscript, the dedicatory page has quite simple border deco rations of lines, while the printed version shows more stylized and geo metric scrollwork (see Illus. 2-a, 2-b). The most evident change, howev er, is found in the upper part of the page, where we find a more carefully and evenly drawn Christchild as well as two Christmas trees clearly different from those on f. 1 of the manuscript. Interestingly, an explana tion for the new shape of the Christmas tree can be obtained by refer ring to f. i*v of the manuscript,72 in whose upper right corner, directly facing the Christmas tree on the left, we find a faint pencil sketch of a Christmas tree. It corresponds exactly to the one in the first edition and must have served the lithographer as a model for his execution. Wheth er Hoffmann is responsible for this alternative pencil drawing and ad vised the lithographer to use it, or whether the latter took the liberty of creating an alternative and more realistic Christmas tree, which was lat er sanctioned by the author, must remain a secret. We may well wonder whether this was one of the cases mentioned by Hoffmann, where he found that the lithographer tried to "improve on [his] dilettantish figures." The fact that the following pages show much fewer changes, and especially leave Hoffmann's simple decorations untouched, might even indicate that Hoffmann (or one of his publishers), having caught the lithographer "in the act" after he had completed the first stone, re quired him to remain faithful to the manuscript. Another alteration is found in the first picture of the "Black Boys," where little Ludwig comes running by, waving a flag. Whereas the manuscript depicts the flag with some scribbles on it, the printed ver sion equips the naughty boy with a banner bearing an eagle. Since the coat of arms of the city of Frankfurt shows an eagle, this new detail may 71. Apparently Hoffmann took a lively interest in the production of his book. In 1925 Riitten &amp; Loening were still in the possession of a proof of an early hand-colored edition, in which Hoffmann criticized the execution of the coloring and gave in structions for the following edition: "Die Lichter — am Weihnachtbaum — miissen brennen wie im Original ... ; den — schwarzen — Buben fehlen die roten Backen und die roten Lippen ... ; der Mohr ist zu blafi" — "The lights on the Christmas tree must burn like in the original; the black boys lack their red cheeks and lips; the moor is too pale" (Bogeng, Das Striiwwelpeter-Manuskript, 25; and Bogeng, Der Sfruwwel peter und sein Vater, 70 f., which specifies that the annotated book was a first edition). 72. The empty original page preceding f. 1.</page><page sequence="24">238 Bibliographical Society of America well be interpreted as a deliberate patriotic gesture on the part of the lithographer (and/or Hoffmann). Finally, Hoffmann's failed attempt at accommodating four different pictures including text on two pages of his manuscript (f. 7 and f. 8) is resolved by reserving a single page for the third scene in which the hunter takes off in front of the hare (p. 10). This not only places the last picture of the story in the center of the page, but also moves the verses from the back of f. 7 to the bottom of page 11. As far as textual matters are concerned, a parallel reading reveals that there are only very minor changes between the handwritten original and the printed version, of which the few merely orthographic ones do not deserve mentioning. Two vocabulary items, however, attract our at tention. In the final scene of "Frederick," the dog in the original manu script text is said to be eating "den guten Gunging." This is changed to "den guten Kuchen" ("the good cake"). Since the word "Gunging" does not exist in German, not even as a dialect word, but rather seems to be a child's mispronunciation for "Kuchen," it is probable that Hoffmann included it as an inside family joke to document his three year old son's speech. The replacement of "Herrmannsbriinnchen," which occurs at the end of the "Wild Hunter" (p. 9), by "tiefes Briinnchen" ("deep well"), is more difficult to explain. Here, too, some concrete family background is likely, such as little Carl's acquaintance with an actual well of that name, but I have not been able to find a "Herrmannsbriinnchen" in or around Frankfurt. While the above features are common to the first Struwwelpeter edi tion in general, two further observations can be made regarding individ ual copies. The first interesting peculiarity is found on p. 8 of the Bei necke copy, as opposed to all other copies examined, depicting the three inky boys parading behind the "Mohrenkind." Their figures are hand colored in darkish gray. In his letter to Yale University, Walter Schatzki comments on this in the following way:73 "According to information received from the original publisher,74 Hoffmann, who supervised care fully the coloring of the book, was at one point dissatisfied with the fact 73- The letter accompanies the Beinecke first edition as a loose leaf. It has been published in facsimile in Sauer, "Wie viele Exemplare," 14. 74. Schatzki's informant appears to have been Joseph Riitten's grand nephew Wilhelm Ernst Oswald (1877-1942), who had succeeded his father Heinrich Oswald (1830-91) as one of the owners of the publishing house Riitten &amp; Loening in 1897.</page><page sequence="25">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 239 that in the story of'Die Geschichte von den schwarzen Buben' the three boys in the last picture were painted only gray-black. Since the text says 'Du siehst sie hier, wie schwarz sie sind, viel schwaerzer als das Mohren kind!' (much blacker than the black-a-moor) he insisted that they be painted entirely black. This copy shows them still in gray and must, therefore, be considered as one of those colored at the earlier stage. The three copies which have gone through my hands75...show the boys painted entirely black." As far as we know, the Beinecke copy is unique in this respect and testifies to the above-mentioned fact that Hoffmann watched closely over the production of his "child," not only during the lithographing process but also with regard to the coloring. That not all features present in the Frankfurt copy are representative of the complete print-run is further borne out by comparing its page 12 with other first edition copies. In its first picture, Caspar's left hand touches the printed title "Die Geschichte vom Suppen-Caspar," where as in the other copies examined the title line is placed higher on the page providing for distance between the title and the illustration. The same applies to the fourth picture on the page, where Caspar's right arm is covered by text up to its elbow. This feature is not present in the other copies seen, in which the text is moved further to the right and Caspar's hand barely touches the text. On 3 October 1845, the book was first advertised to the book trade in the Borsenblattfur den Deutschen Buchhandel, and there can be no doubt that it became an immediate success. Hoffmann tells us that 1,500 cop ies were printed of the first edition, which sold out within approximately four weeks.76 Once again, though, Hoffmann's memory of events dating back over 25 years must have been blurred. This applies first to the number of copies printed. In his letter to Hiller written within weeks of the publica tion of the book, he states that the first printing consisted of 3,000 copies.77 75- The copies referred to were the New York Public Library, Harvard, and Op penheimer copies. The Frankfurt and Cotsen copies also show entirely black boys. 76. "Nach etwa vier Wochen kam Loning [recte: Lowenthal] zu mir mit der Mittheilung... die Exemplare seien alle fort, sie seien verschwunden wie ein Tropfen auf einem heifien Steine" — "After about four weeks Loning came to me with the news that all copies had been sold.. .they had disappeared like a drop on a hot stone" (Hoffmann, "Vom Struwwelpeter," 18). 77.

Secondly, according to an advertisement in a Frankfurt newspa per,78 the first edition was still available two months after the book's publication. Indeed, even in March of 1846, when the second edition was being planned, not all copies of the first were sold, as the contract between Hoffmann and Riitten specifies.74 Hoffmann also tells us about the advice he gave his publishers concerning the price of the book:"... then the book must be inexpensive, it mustn't cost more than 59 kreuzer, then people will say: It doesn't even cost 1 gulden."80 It is, of course, quite likely that Hoffmann discussed the price of the book with his publish ers, yet the figure given by Hoffmann is clearly wrong, as the above mentioned advertisement in Intelligenz-Blatt proves: The retail price for the book was 48 kreuzer. The year 1846 witnessed three different editions of the book. In early 1846 Hoffmann and his publishers agreed on an official contract specify ing royalties for the author. Hoffmann assures us that his demands were moderate: "I was modest in my demands in order not to raise the price of the book."81 Judging from the sum of 150 gulden he received from his publishers for the 5,000 copies printed of the second edition, Hoff mann's royalties amounted to 6.25 percent per copy.82 Hoffmann's al 78.

Within the city of Frankfurt itself, the literary disguise does not seem to have worked too well, and indeed there is no indication that Hoffmann might even have been interested in concealing his author ship. This at least follows from Hoffmann's statement — taken at face value — that in early 1846, a few months after the book's publication, he was "frequently stopped in the street by grateful mothers or enthusiastic fathers" expressing their delight with the book.86 Furthermore the Frankfurter Konversationsblatt, advertising the second edition on 11 De cember 1846 revealed its author's identity, as "the here generally respect ed and talented doctor Heinrich Hoffmann."87 The "improvement" and "augmentation" of the book consisted in the addition of two stories, "Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug" ("Pauline"; 2 pages) and "Die Geschichte von dem Zappel-Philipp" ("Philip"; 3 pages), bring ing the total number of pages to 20.88 Although no original manuscript ler, 1994), 55. The contract specifies that Hoffmann's royalties for any ensuing edi tions would be 30 gulden for every 1,000 copies printed. This agrees with the sum of 258 gulden received on 25 June, 1850 for 8,600 copies (3,600 English and 5,000 German; cf.

They were inserted in the book as items VI and VII to precede the "Struwwelpeter" page. Interest ingly enough, there are other differences worth noting, as a comparison between the first and second edition reveals. Although, at first glance, the text and pictures of the two editions appear to be identical this is not the case.89 Instead, a close comparison shows that the text was newly typeset by the printer for the second edition. Besides the different spac ing of letters and lines, several differences in spelling and punctuation can be noted.90 What is, however, even more surprising is that many details of the illustrations do not correspond to those of the first edition. This hitherto unnoticed fact can be observed on every page. On the opening page, for example, the drawing of the faces, hair and hands of the figures is slightly but distinctly different, as is that of the rider, the sword and the Christmas trees. What is especially noteworthy is that the Struwwelpeter figure at the end of the book (p. 20) has been re drawn, changing his shock of hair, his face, nails and shoes as well as the pair of scissors to the left of his face (see Illus. 3-b, 3-c).The three black boys on p. 8, whose color seems to have been a matter of Hoffmann's concern,91 are now printed in dark black, and did not need to be colored by hand any longer. With the exception of this latter feature, none of these changes seem to be motivated.92 Yet they clearly indicate that the lithographic stones used for the second edition were not those of the first. We are thus led to assume that the publisher had disposed of the first stones before having the second edition printed. It would be specu lating to decide whether he had done so because they were no longer useable after the first print-run of 3,000, or whether, as was often the case,93 he had recycled his valuable "hardware" for the production of another title, since he did not immediately anticipate a second edition of the book.

Not all of them can be mentioned here. 93. I thank Hans Ries for his competent information on lithographic techniques.</page><page sequence="29">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 243 plays an unusual feature worth noting94: Its page 20, which is marked as such, shows the newly designed Struwwelpeter figure and the title in scription "VI. Der Struwwelpeter" as in the first edition, although it should read "VIII. Der Struwwelpeter," this story having been moved to eighth place after the addition of two more stories. This obvious mis take seems to have been noticed and corrected sometime during the printing of the second edition, as the other copies examined show. It did not take long for the book's original title "Lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder," which was also used for the second edition, to be changed to "Struwwelpeter." Although the third edition of 1846 was the first one to carry the word in its title (and use the original one as a subtitle), the renaming process must have started earlier. Hoffmann himself relates that the "children.. .simply demanded: We want the Struw welpeter."95 It is interesting to note that the reviews of the second edi tion which appeared in Frankfurt newspapers already give an alterna tive title in parentheses: "lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder (vulgo Struwwelpeter)."96 By the time this review appeared, a third and fourth edition had already come out with the new title. Otherwise, they were identical reprints of the second edition. Meanwhile the book's enormous success continued unbroken.9' When 94- This copy is found in our own collection. 95.

Didaskalia on 10 December 1846 and Frankfurter Konversationsblatt on 11 December 1846. Both articles start with a direct reference to Struwwelpeter: "Da ist er nun wieder, der liederliche Struwwelpeter" — "Here he is again, the slovenly Struwwelpeter" (Didaskalia); and "Da war er ja wieder, der kleine wilde Geselle mit dem trotzigen Gesicht, den verstruwwelt schmutzigen Haaren, den hafilich langen Nageln" — "Here he is again, the little wild rascal with the impudent face, the disheveled dirty hair, the ugly long nails" (Konversationsblatt). 97. This is also reflected in the appearance of Struwwelpeter imitations as early as 1846 (cf. the review in Didaskalia, which mentions "mannigfaltige, bereits schon entstandene Nachahmungen" — "numerous already existing imitations"), and the production of a Struwwelpeter game (Das Struwwelpeter-Spiel. 9 Karten mit illu minierten lustigen Bildern, einem Spielplan undKdstchen mit 45 Gldschen und2 Wiir feln), advertised in Intelligenzblatt derfreieir Stadt Frankfurt, Siebente Beilage zu Nr. 149 of 14 December 1847, an^ Mainzer Zeitung of 24 December 1847. The game was produced by the firm of Lotzbeck of Niirnberg. On the same day, the latter source also mentions the following Struwwelpeter imitation: Neues Struwwelpeter</page><page sequence="30">244 Bibliographical Society of America a fifth edition appeared in the fall of 1847, a total of 21,500 copies had already been sold.98 By this time, Hoffmann (or his publishers) had de cided that it was time to abandon the policy of veiling the author's iden tity by means of changing pseudonyms. From now on Hoffmann's full name and his academic title appeared in all editions of Struwwelpeter. This edition, which again had a new cover design added another two stories, "Die Geschichte vom Hanns Guck-in-die-Luft" ("Johnny"; 3 pages), and "Die Geschichte vom fliegenden Robert" ("Robert"; 1 page), for which Hoffmann received the sum of 40 gulden," and also estab lished the definitive order in which the stories of the book were to ap pear from now on. By moving up to page 2, right behind the "Preface," "Struwwelpeter" had assumed his due place, and the two new stories were added to the end of the book, completing the Struwwelpeter canon and bringing the book to 24 pages.100 Again, a close comparison of the illustrations with those in the three previous editions reveals several changes.101 These first of all apply to the Struwwelpeter figure itself, whose face and hair have been altered (see Illus. 3-d). A more easily detected improvement is seen on p. 4, where Frederick's outstretched right hand pointing forward as he raises his left to hit the dog with his whip has been transformed into a fist.

This figure comes from the letter, which Hoffmann wrote to his friend Friedrich Ludwig Krahmer on 24 Mai 1847: "So war die Struwwelpeterei ein zufal liger hauslicher Scherz fur meinen Carl; ist aber allerdings ein offentlicher in 21 500 Exemplaren geworden" — "Struwwelpeter was a chance family frolic for my Carl; but it has become a public one in 21,500 copies"; cf. n. 12. 99. The above-mentioned contract promises Hoffmann the sum of 10 gulden "fur jedes neue Bilderblatt, welches Herr Dr. Hoffmann, mit Einwilligung der Literarischen Anstalt, den fruheren zwanzig Bildertafeln hinzuzufiigen sich erbie ten wird" — "for each new illustrated page, which Dr. Hoffmann will offer to add to the earlier twenty pages with the consent of the Literarische Anstalt." For the original handwritten versions of the stories, see above, p. 232. 100. For a diagram of the "Evolution of the Struwwelpeter canon", see appendix. 101. I have not been able to locate a copy of the fifth edition. My observations rest on a sixth edition owned by the Stadt- und Universitatsbibliothek Frankfurt, which claims in its subtitle to be "Der fiinften vermehrten Auflage unveranderter Abdruck" — "an unchanged reprint of the fifth augmented edition."</page><page sequence="31">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 245 drawing of a hand has here been improved upon.102 Similarly, Paulinchen's face (p. 6), Nicolas' hands (pp. 9-10), and the facial expression in Kon rad's last picture have undergone visible changes. For the first time also, the black silhouettes of the inky boys show eyes in the form of white dots. On the whole, however, these changes are minor. It must have satisfied both author and publishers that for the follow ing years a steady demand for the book required regular reissues, usually two a year. By 1859 a total of 26 editions had already appeared. Although no precise figures are known for the number of copies printed for the individual editions, we can assume that by the end of the 1850s many tens of thousands of copies had been sold throughout Germany.103 Be tween 1847 and 1859 the book and its cover remained unchanged (see Illus. l-c, showing the cover of a seventeenth edition). Struwwelpeter Reborn The year 1859 marked the beginning of a new era for Struwwelpeter's iconographic life. It started with the publication of the twenty-seventh edition, which the publisher announced as a "completely revised edi tion."104 The new version was first hailed in an enthusiastic review in Intelligenz-Blatt derfreieyi Stadt Frankfurt (Extrabeilage) on 14 Decem ber 1859, which confirms that Hoffmann himself was responsible for the new design: "We believed that Struwwelpeter as it first left Dr. Hoff mann's hands could not be improved upon..but Hoffmann has proven that he, and he alone, could dare to change completely the figures of his picture book, which have become almost mythical."105 None of Hoff 102. As Ute Liebert informs me, we find a pencil drawing of a fist next to this picture in the Bodmer copy of the first edition (which I have not seen). Whether this was a sketch leading to the above-mentioned improvement or a later compar ative note, it is impossible to say. 103. Besides the number of 21,500 valid for the first to the fifth editions, 5,000 copies are attested for the fourteenth and fifteenth editions of 1850 together (cf. Scholz, 27), and 6,000 copies for the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth editions of 1857, cf. n. 82. 104.

On Christmas Day 1858, Hoffmann wrote a humorous letter ad dressed "To Messrs. J. Riitten and Dr. Loning, the mortal representa tives of the immortal 'Literarische Anstalt,'"106 in which he thanked his publishers for sending him royalties for 12,000 copies of Struwwelpeter.107 It included a poem in three stanzas, called "Kriegerisches Kinderbuchlied," ending with the refrain "Aus dem Knaben wird nur ein braver Mann, Wenn den Struwwelpet (!) er zerreiften kann."108 Excusing himself for not continuing the poetic flow of verses, Hoffmann concludes his letter written "in best Holiday spirits" with the following words: "but I better leave that and rather color great Nicolas' new coat."109 This comment must refer to Hoffmann working on new illustrations for his bestseller book. It is the only document reporting on this work in progress.110 nur er allein, es wagen diirfe, die fast mytisch gewordenen Gestalten seines Bilder buches vollig umzuwandeln." 106. "An der unsterblichen literarischen Anstalt sterbliche Vertreter die Herrn J. Riitten und Dr. Loning!" 107. A facsimile of the letter prefaces the four hundredth edition of Struwwel peter of 1917. While an editorial note dated "end of November 1917" accompanying it holds that the letter was written as a thank-you note for royalties received for the book "Im Himmel und auf der Erde," the contents of the letter do not indicate such a purpose. It would also be quite unlikely that the first edition of this newly published children's book would have been printed in such great quantity. The letter is now lost. 108. "A Martial children's book song: ... A boy will only become a man, when he is able to tear up a Struwwelpeter book." 109.

So far a review of the twenty-eighth edition, which appeared in Didaskalia on 18 December 1859, has been held to be the first mention of the new version; cf. most studies following Walter Sauer, "Der Struwwelpeter und Stepka Rastrepka. Zur Ikonographie der 2. Struwwelpeterfassung." Schiefertafel 8 (1985): 20-34.

Today, it is to be found in the City and University Library of Frankfurt am Main (call number "Ms. Ff. H. Hoffmann"), and has an interesting history of ownerships. After remaining in the Riitten &amp; Loening archives until 1928, it was handed over to the Frankfurt banker Ernst Wertheimber together with other Hoffmann autographs as a security for a loan. Fleeing from Nazi perse cution, Wertheimber took it with him when he emigrated to the United States in 1938, where it remained in the possession of his family. In 1953, it appeared on the New York antiquarian book market for $6,500 (then approx. DM 27,300) and was bought by the Frankfurt art dealer Wil helm Henrich, who offered it to the City of Frankfurt for the purchase price plus his own costs. When Frankfurt refused the offer, the book was given to an auction house in Stuttgart (Stuttgarter Kunstkabinett). By the time the auction took place on May 18,1954 the prospects of having the manuscripts sold to a foreign bidder and a public campaign to save them for Hoffmann's hometown had convinced the civic authorities to take part in the auction. They were able to obtain them for DM 41,000.111 A detailed description of the Hoffmann items to be auctioned112 was published by the Stuttgarter Kunstkabinett prior to the auction.113 It included reduced reproductions of 13 pages from the second Struwwel peter manuscript.

Ms. 2 consists of 24 leaves, all but one of which measure between 31.2 x 24.5 to 27.8 x 23.5 cm. They are today mounted behind passe partouts, and to all appearance were never bound. Some of them were once folded in the middle.115 The leaves are numbered 1-23 at the bottom of the pages in Hoffmann's hand in accordance with the page numbers of the printed book. A separate small sheet (12.2 x 10.2cm.) has a o (zero) in pencil in its upper right hand corner. It shows a partly colored sketch of an alternative portrait of Struwwelpeter (see Illus. 4-b), and, according to the description in Arntz 1954, was once taped onto the top of f. 2 ("Struwwelpeter") over the original drawing, which it matches exactly in dimensions. Five pages carry the watermark "J WHATMAN 1858." Two pages are damaged. F. 8 has incurred some loss of its illustration at the lower right hand corner, and has been repaired expertly with a trian gular piece of paper measuring 12 x 6.5 x 14 cm. F. 9, showing Nicolas dunking the boys into the inkwell, is badly damaged by fire and lacks the entire lower part of the page. The pictures are set in a pencil-drawn frame averaging 22 x 15 cm. and leaving a wide margin. As in Ms. 1, the illustrations were first sketched with pencil, but the tracing of the lines with ink by means of a very fine pen seems generally to have preceded the coloring, which is executed very neatly. In some cases, pen strokes are applied over the colors. In the illustration found in the lower left hand corner of page 1, two items, a little duck and a little dog, were added in pencil after the coloring and may well have been an after thought. For the writing, executed with a different pen and ink, the paper is ruled in pencil. The order of the stories as well as the distribu tion of text and illustrations coincide with those of the first version.116 The only textual alterations, all prompted by the revised illustrations, 114- Riitten &amp; Loening. 115. The original final leaf containing "Die Geschichte vom Fliegenden Robert" is missing from the manuscript. Not having been included in the 1954 auction lot, it is today found in a private collection in Frankfurt; cf. G. H. Herzog, Marion Herzog-Hoinkis, and Helmut Siefert, eds., Heinrich Hoffmann. Leben und Werk in Texten und Bildern (Frankfurt am Main: Insel. 1995), 89, which prints a reduced black and white facsimile of the page, without giving a location for it. 116. The ten lines on f. 9 have been split into two blocks of four + six lines arranged side by side.</page><page sequence="35">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 249 are found in "Frederick." In all, four lines of verse are added on ff.4 and 5 ("Jedoch nach Hause lief der Hund, Und trug die Peitsche in dem Mund"117 and "Die Peitsche hat er mitgebracht, Und nimmt sie sorglich sehr in Acht"118) and the wording of'Und der Herr Doktor steht dabei" has been changed to "Und der Herr Doktor sitzt dabei."119 F. 21, the first page of "Johnny," has two marginal notes (possibly by Hoffmann) con cerning minor revisions destined for the attention of the xylographer.120 The published book of this "new and totally revised edition"121 has a newly designed dark green cover of slightly larger boards than before (26 x 20 cm.) and is the first to show the new name of the firm, Riitten &amp; Loning (see Illus. 1-d).122 The book's title is set in a frame of orna mental scrollwork which integrates the ten titles of the tales. The back cover gives the name of the printer ("C. Krebs-Schmitt in Frankfurt a. M."). As usual, the date of publication is not given, but the number of the edition is indicated. The publication of the new version coincided with the adoption of a new printing technique by the firm of Riitten &amp; Loening in 1859.123 In this recently invented production process, "electrotype," woodcuts taken 117.

In 1857 Zacharias Lowenthal had changed his name to Carl Friedrich Loen ing. The firm's name change occurred on April 26, 1859. Cf. Wurm, 24, 33. 123. Hoffmann ("Vom Struwwelpeter," 18) himself notes a change in production: "Die Herstellung des Buches ist nunmehr auch eine wesentlich andere geworden, statt in Lithographie sind die Bilder in Holzschnitt tibertragen und die Holzschnitte galvanisch in Kupferplatten, um sie zu schonen" — "The production of the book has also become quite different; the pictures have been transferred in woodcuts rather than in lithographs, and the woodcuts transferred galvanically in copper plates in order to protect them."

Hanebutt-Benz.</page><page sequence="36">250 Bibliographical Society of America from the original were transferred onto galvanized copper plates, from which text and pictures were printed simultaneously. Afterwards, the leaves were colored by hand. A comparison between the manuscript and the published version re veals the greatest faithfulness to the hand-drawn original, only very few and most minute details having been changed by the xylographer: the knob on the doctor's walking stick has a round rather than a cylindrical shape; the pom-pom on Nicolas' hat is somewhat thinner; in the "Wild Hunter" the sun has 10 rather than 6 rays, and the hare's "house of leaves" 6 rather than 7 leaves; the well has slightly more intricate brick work; and Philip's soup terrine has shattered into more pieces than in the original. Of greater interest, however, is a comparison between this totally new iconographic rendering and the illustrations found in the first to twenty-sixth editions of the book. In general, Hoffmann's second ver sion is distinguished by much more realism and artistic refinement. Whereas the previous illustrations were simple and admittedly "dilet tantish," drawn spontaneously in a very "economical" style almost char acteristic of caricatures or cartoons, the new pictures are carefully com posed, have a "richer" flavor and are equipped with more details including occasional background scenery. Examples for this are found on almost every page. In the "Preface" (see Illus. 2-a-2-d), the three constituent childhood scenes, a child playing with toys, eating at a table and walking with his mother, distributed on three sides of the page and connected by fine scrollwork, have been reassembled at the bottom of the page and contained in squares, where the child is shown in a room, surrounded by a garland of leaves, and on a street. The Christmas gifts, which had been placed quite sparsely along either side of the Christ child and below the Christmas trees, are now dispensed lavishly from plates presented by two angels. They include on the left side toys char acteristic for girls — doll, comb, umbrella, and doll house items — on the right side items more suitable for boys — rifle, drum, toy horse, and wagon. The opened pages of the book, which the Christchild holds in his hands, showing a rooster and a clown, have been replaced by two miniature pages from Struwwelpeter, providing a nice instance of a "book within the book." In "Frederick" the sequence of individual scenes, originally held together by fine lines of scrollwork and lattices now appears in integrated pictorial compositions, such as a brick wall</page><page sequence="37">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 251 with an opening, a full landscape accommodating three scenes on p. 4, and the interior of a house on p. 5. On each page, Hoffmann uses stair cases to place the consecutive events on different levels and interconnect the individual scenes. The little black-a-moor in the "Black Boys" (p. 8) now faces left as he walks along a path lined with realistic flowers and decorative trees, while the three boys balance on a richly decorated scaffold. On pp. 9 and 10, inkwell and Nicolas, who now also faces left, have switched sides. A humoristic detail has been added to "Caspar." Day five of his tragic life and end, which was represented by a bare cross on a mound of dirt in the first version, now shows a proper grave with flowers, a cross bearing Caspar's name and — to add insult to injury — a soup terrine.124 The "Wild Hunter" has been subjected to the fewest alterations, the only major one being the "nose job" of the hunter, who originally had a very long and pointed nose. The pictures of all of the other stories have been thoroughly revised. The book's main protagonist also experienced a thorough transformation. Ms. 1 and the ensuing edi tions had shown him with unkempt hair hanging into his face, and fingernails three times as long as his hands, but otherwise quite neatly dressed in a children's dress of the time, with collar and belt, hose and shoes. In the new version (see Illus. 4-c), much of Struwwelpeter's face is visible, and we are confronted with a character looking not only con siderably older, but also quite sad and grim. His hair has grown im mensely and reaches down to his ankles, while his nails have been some what shortened. With the exception of the Struwwelpeter figure, most modern editions of the book follow the pictures of this new version. We can only guess that the 1859 Struwwelpeter effigy was not favorably re ceived by the public, since the editions from 1861 on replaced this rather unfriendly creature with the figure with which we are familiar today (see Illus. 4-d). The sketch appended to Ms. 2 as f. o may be an interim version documenting continued experimentation with Struwwelpeter's looks. It already somehow approximates Struwwelpeter's definitive portrait showing the full face of a friendly and likeable little boy, neatly dressed, whose shock of hair stands on end around his face in an Afro 124- Hoffmann here quotes himself. He first used the soup terrine on Caspar's grave in Bastian der Faulpelz, (Engl. "Lazybones"); cf. Heinrich Hoffmann, Bas tian der Faulpelz (Frankfurt: Jager, 1854), 24, where Lazybones is found among the graves of Struwwelpeter, Johnny Head-in-Air, Fidgety Philip, Soup-Caspar, and others "die nicht viel besser sind als er" ("who are not much better than himself').</page><page sequence="38">252 Bibliographical Society of America like hairdo. Since no original drawing is extant, we do not know if it is indeed based on an autograph by Hoffmann. In this, a note by Walter Schatzki describing an English thirteenth edition, based on the thirti eth German edition of i860, might be worth considering: "The Slovenly Peter picture differs still from the final version.... The cataloguer learned recently from one of the former owners of the German publishing house that this late version was drawn under the author's supervision by a member of the artist family Klimsch."125 Struwwelpeter's "Godfather": The Russian Connection Whether it was Hoffmann's own idea to present his Struwwelpeter in a new guise, or whether he set to work at the publishers' instigation, be cause they felt that Hoffmann's first pictures were no longer suitable for a market offering more attractive picture books, we are today unable to say.126 That they were aware of Hoffmann working on a new manuscript is shown by the letter of 25 December 1858.127 It must, in any case, have been their common decision to give it a published form. 125.

This ascription refers to the Frankfurt family of the painter and printmaker Ferdinand Karl Klimsch (1812-90), whose son Eugen (1839-96), also a painter, became a prolific illustrator of children's books from the 1870s on (see Eberhard Semrau, "Klimsch, Eugen," Lexikon der Kinder undJugendliteratur, ed. Klaus Doderer, et al. [Weinheim, Basel: Beltz, 1984], Vol. 2, 224f-)- To the latter we owe three portraits of Heinrich Hoffmann, one dated 1888 (first published in Hessenberg, [vii]), another one in two versions dated 11 April 1894 (first published in Ciba Zeitschrift $ [1938], nr. 55: 1911); and Herzog, et al., Heinrich Hoffmann, 259).

Several comments in Bernhardi's bibliography of 1852 (Karl Bernhardi, ed., Wegweiser durch die deutschen Volks- und Jugendschriften [Leipzig: Mayer, 1852], passim.) show that Hoffmann's first illustrations were by no means generally ac claimed; cf. Beate Zekorn ("Freude an Fratzen - Zur friihen Rezeption von Struw welpeter und Struwwelpetriaden," Struwwelpost 4 [1998]: 9-13), who argues that it may have been this kind of criticism that convinced Hoffmann and his publishers to reillustrate the book. 127. See above, p. 246.</page><page sequence="39">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 253 As far as more concrete ideas inspiring Hoffmann's work are con cerned an interesting international connection can be found.128 On 18 April 1857, the Polish publisher Boleslaw Maurycy Wolff (1826-83), owner of the famous St. Petersburg publishing firm of M.O. Vol'f (his Russian name was Mavrikij Osipowitsch Vol'f),129 sent Hoffmann a dedicated copy of a Russian translation of Struwwelpeter entitled Step ka-Rastrepka. Razskazy dlja detej, which had just appeared in his house.130 The book, whose first edition appeared in 1849,131 is a free verse render ing of Hoffmann's Struwwelpeter stories, but lacks the "Preface" and the "Wild Hunter." Its illustrations, executed by G. Hohenfelden and L. Bohnstedt, differ greatly from Hoffmann's first version, and are artisti cally definitely superior to it.132 Surprisingly, a comparison between this Russian edition and Hoff mann's second version reveals many similarities. They are especially ob vious in those scenes, which have undergone the strongest alterations. Since Stepka-Rastrepka antedates Hoffmann's second manuscript by al most a decade, and the copy owned by Hoffmann carries an 1857 inscrip tion, the only explanation for these correspondences can be that Hoff mann apparently liked some of the pictures in Wolff s book so well, that 128.

(cf. Herzog, et al., Heinrich Hoffmann, 94). The dating "18./ 30. April 1857" (given in Herzog and Siefert, Struwwelpeter-Hoffmann, 106) rather than 18. April, mistakes the Russian genitive case ending added to the numeral as another number. 131. St. Petersburg: Isakov, 1849; printed by Ch.

By juxtaposing a few pictures from Hoffmann's first and second versions and the Russian book, we can discover where Hoffmann's dependence on Stepka-Rastrepka is strongest. The "doctor scene" in "Frederick" is a nice case in point. In Hoff mann's 1844/5 version (see Illus. 5-a), the doctor stands on the left side at the foot of Frederick's bed, holding his hat and walking stick behind his back, while the bitten youngster is lying in bed with a night cap on, facing the doctor. Under his bed we see a chamber pot and on the night stand next to his bed a medicine bottle. The new version of 1858/9 shows significant changes (see Illus. 5-b), almost all of which can be traced to the Russian edition. This applies to the general composition of the scene as much as to individual details of furniture, costume and appear ance of the protagonists. Frederick now faces towards the right, his bed and nightstand are Russian imports, and the doctor, an exact copy of his Russian colleague, sits at the bedside (see Illus. 5-c). He has deposited his top hat on the nightstand, whose door is ajar, the walking stick lean ing against it. The new illustration certainly interprets the verses better than the old picture. As in the text, which specifies that Frederick gets bitter medicine,133 the doctor is now administering drops from an over size spoon. One detail of Hoffmann's own imagination is, however, re tained: the chamber pot, which has been moved from under Frederick's bed to under the nightstand. Among other features on the same page also inherited from the Russian translation are Frederick's dining room table and the napkin around the dog's neck. The new illustrations in "Pauline," depicted in four scenes distributed over two pages, also show a very strong indebtedness to Stepka-Rastrep ka. The girl has been completely transformed into her Russian counter part Katyusha, not only in her looks and elegant outfit, but also with regard to her movements and behavior. The third scene is especially closely copied, although the new pictures no longer entirely fit the text. Whereas the old version specified that "the dress catches fire [and] the apron burns,"134 Pauline no longer wears an apron, and the flames have instead caught the back of her dress. Even the two anthropomorphic cats lamenting her tragic fate with handkerchiefs and funereal bows, and the stylized tree ornaments delimiting and separating the four different scenes, are taken over from the Russian version. 133- "und gibt ihm bittre Arznenei." 134.

Here, a special closeness can be observed between his new scissor-man and the Russian "portnoi" ("tailor"), as he comes running into the room to cut off the poor boy's thumb, with his coattails and measuring tape flapping behind him and his hat blowing off his head. Further similarities can be found in other stories, where Hoffmann's revision does not follow the Russian model quite as closely, witness Fidgety Philip's mother, who cannot deny her Russian origin, as she surveys the table first through one and then both lenses of her lorgnette, and Johnny Head-in-Air standing by the water dripping wet and freez ing after being rescued is also deja vu. Although Hoffmann adopted many features from his Russian source, not all changes can be traced to it. Instead, he seems to have been selec tive in using material from Stepka-Rastrepka, here and there borrowing a picture or idea which he found especially appealing, and drawing on his own imagination in other places. In yet other cases he seems to have seen little need for major changes, such as in the "Wild Hunter" whose pictures have undergone the least alteration. This may well be explained by the fact that it is not included in the Russian version. Unfortunately, we know nothing about any further personal correspondence between Wolff and Hoffmann (or his publishers), which might answer the ques tion whether the St Petersburg publisher gave his permission for mate rial from his book to be used in Hoffmann's second manuscript. Struwwelpeter's Coming of Age The new version sold for the same price (57 Kreuzer) as the previous editions and was received very positively by the press.135 They praised the "charm of its novelty as well as the enhanced complexity of coloring and additions,"136 and predicted that children would "enjoy themselves immensely" and that the book would be "received everywhere with re 135- I have found two reviews of the new version published in the 12 December 1859 issue of Didaskalia and in Intelligenz-Blatt of 14 December 1859, both of which comment on the price of the book: "...aufierst billigen Preis von nur 57 kr.rh." ("...extremely inexpensive price of57 Rhenish kreuzer") (Didaskalia); "Der Preis des Buches ist.. .der alte geblieben" ("The price of the book has remained the same") (Intelligenz-Blatt). 136. "Reize der Neuheit.. .grofiere Mannichfaltigkeit in Farben und Neben bezeichnungen" (Intelligenz-Blatt).</page><page sequence="44">258 Bibliographical Society of America newed joy and love and become a welcome adornment of all Christmas tables."137 Their prediction proved true. The following years saw an av erage of four editions a year so that by 1876, when Struwwelpeter was thirty-one, the publishers were able to present the one hundredth edi tion. For this occasion Hoffmann created an additional jubilee page ("Jubilaumsblatt zur hundertsten Auflage") which was to accompany the Riitten 8c Loening editions from now on as p. 1b.138 It shows yet another new Struwwelpeter figure, a happy little fellow with long curly hair, swinging on a garland amid other figures from Hoffmann's chil dren's books lined up to honor him with cheers, banners, music, and flowers. The page also includes a twelve-line poem in which Struwwel peter proudly looks back on his successful career and vows that he will not allow his hair to be newly styled again, but rather stay the fellow he is.139 His promise was not to be kept. More than twenty years after the appearance of the second version, Riitten &amp; Loening issued a third version of Struwwelpeter,140 It first appeared in 1881 as a chromolithographed "Deluxe edition" ("Prachtaus gabe"), and again in 1889 in a variant called "New fine edition" ("Neue feine Ausgabe") with hand-colored woodcuts.141 No original manu script is extant, but it seems unlikely that Hoffmann, seventy-two at the time, had a hand in it. That he must have at least "tolerated" the reillus tration seems certain. J37- "werden sie...sich unermudlich ergotzen" (Didaskalia); "Er wird liberall mit erneuter Lust und Liebe aufgenommen werden und ein willkommener Schmuck aller Weihnachtstische sein" (Intelligenz-Blatt). 138. The original is found in a private collection in Frankfurt. A color reproduc tion of the drawing is found on the back cover of Herzog and Siefert, Struwwel peter-Hoffmann, and a black and white one in Herzog et al., 91, where the location of the drawing is given cryptically as "Sammlung R. Frankfurt am Main." The same provenience is stated for the reproduction on the back cover of G.H. Her zog, Dr. Heinrich Hoffmann. Der Struwwelpeter oder lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder. Mit einem Nachwort von Else Hessenberg (Frankfurt: Heinrich-Hoffmann Museum, 1979). 139. "Zwar liefi ich mich kostlich frisiren, Sie zausten mir boslich das Haar; Das soil mir nicht wieder passiren, Ich bleibe der Bursch, der ich war." 140. Cf.

The "Prachtausgabe" gives "August Weisbrod" as printer (p. 24), the "Neue feine Ausgabe," "August Osterrieth" (back cover), both of Frankfurt am Main.</page><page sequence="45">The "Childhood" of Struwwelpeter 259 Both editions have a slightly larger format (28 x 22 cm.) and new front covers. Whereas the 1881 edition uses the dedicatory page with the Christmas scene and replaces the verses with the title (see Illus. 7-a), the "New Fine Edition" presents a completely new design for its front cover (see Illus. 7-b). It shows a Struwwelpeter figure holding before him the coat of arms of the City of Frankfurt, surrounded by several other char acters from the book, including the two cats from "Pauline," as well as a panorama of the city of Frankfurt. The back cover contains an advertise ment for Hoffmann's four other children's books and the Melodien zutn Struwwelpeter by Andreas Hussla, also published by Riitten &amp; Loening. Three pages (lb, 4, and 9) are signed "X. A. Ettling" pointing to the "xylographic atelier" of Jacob Ettling of Bockenheim near Frankfurt.142 The illustrations of these two editions are clearly based on the second version, but all pictures, including the jubilee page commemorating the 100th edition, have been redrawn in an attempt to answer to changed tastes in children's books. This is visible on every page in the presenta tion of more detail, more artistic complexity and a greater variety of colors. The characters and their facial expressions have come more to life, and the scenes are embedded in more realistic landscape. There is also more elaborate scrollwork on the pages and the coloring is more careful ly executed, especially in the chromolithographed edition of 1881. Among the specific alterations apparent in this third version, we find for example a much sweeter Struwwelpeter (see Illus. 7-c) and a much more child-like Pauline. In contrast to the second and in accordance with the first version and the text, she has been re-equipped with an apron, which catches fire. To the little black-a-moor the artist has given a gold ear ring, while Fidgety Philip's mother has received a fashionable bonnet. In the "Wild Hunter" finely drawn bushes against the backdrop of a recog nizable village have been added to the scenery, and the hunter's half timbered house is especially carefully depicted (see Illus. 7-d). The pic ture thus gains in perspective and greater depth. The omission of one detail clearly reflects the prudish attitudes around the end of the century: the chamber pot has been banned from underneath Frederick's nightstand.143 142. On Ettling, who had been working for Gustave Dore in Paris and also made woodblocks for some of Wilhelm Busch's works, cf. Hanebutt-Benz, 1034, "95 143. It is interesting to note that Hoffmann's chamber pot had a similar fate in Victorian England.

Although it must for a time have been quite popular, it was not able to replace the second version in becoming the standard. In addition to these two special editions, the 1880s saw the appear ance of a card game "authorized by publisher and author," published by the firm of B. Dondorf of Frankfurt.144 It is also of some iconographic interest. The pictures on its 36 cards are again all redrawn, but generally based on the second version. Some scenes have been adapted to fit the frame (6.7 x 5.5 cm.) on a card measuring 9x6 cm. We notice for in stance a compressed view of the scissor-man, whose coattails and mea suring tape droop rather than flap behind, and whose top hat is just in the process of flying off (see Illus. 8-a). In the first and last scenes of the "Black Boys," the picture is concentrated to show the boys not in single file but as a group (see Illus. 8-b). One especially noticeable addition is found in "Philip" and "Robert."145 The stories originally only consisted of three scenes, which would have made them unsuitable for a card game. The publisher therefore had the artist add a fourth scene to com plete the foursome. In "Philip," the additional picture shows the fidgety boy still sitting properly on his chair (see Illus. 8-c); and Robert is shown as he leaves the house with his umbrella, leaving two good children indoors reading and playing (see Illus. 8-d). The card game was issued in 1886 and seems to represent the last iconographic change effectuated during Hoffmann's lifetime under the auspices of Struwwelpeters original publishing house. Meanwhile the book continued its triumphant march through the nursery. At Hoff mann's death in 1894, Struwwelpeter, then in its fiftieth year, had reached 186 editions and had established itself as the most popular and influen tial German children's book ever written. 144- Der Struwwelpeter.
