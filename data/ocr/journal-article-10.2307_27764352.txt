<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theres Something about Hyde JULES LAW It would seem to go without saying that there is something inhuman about Edward Hyde, though it certainly takes a while before the characters get around to saying this. By the time Gabriel John Utterson blurts out that "the man seems hardly human" (Stevenson 42), an aura of the rhetorical sublime seems already to have settled about Hyde. "I really can name nothing out of the way," says Utterson's kinsman Enfield (36), and Utterson himself remarks on Hyde's lack of "nameable malformation." Yet the trope of the unnameable or the unspeakable, so essential to the itinerary of gothic in Eve Sedgwick's reading, is perhaps not the most salient feature of the novella's initial descriptions of Hyde. That distinction would have to go to a more humble signifier: the word something (emphasis added in the follow ing quotes). "There is something wrong with his appearance," says Enfield, "some thing displeasing, something downright detestable" (35). Utterson soon concurs: "There must be something else. . . . There is something more, if I could find a name for it" (42). In turn, Dr. Lanyon later relates that "there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature . . . something seizing, surprising and revolting" (74). And when Poole, the butler, asserts that "there was something queer about that gentleman?something that gave a man a turn," Utterson again chimes in with the "s" word: "T own I felt something of what you describe,' said Mr. Utterson" (65). Finally, Jekyll himself echoes these descriptions (or ought we to say evasions?) in his personal account of what it feels like to be Hyde: "There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new" (80). Now I want to propose that on the face of it this is a rather extraordinary fetishization of a single, and rather modest, signifier, and in its reduction of Hyde to an unspecifiable quidditas it would seem by itself to signal Hyde's inhumanity, with the emphasis here being on the obtuse materiality of the signifier rather than on the trope of unspecifiability per se. In short, the insistence of this signifier suggests that Hyde is pure thingness. In this essay I suggest that the inhuman is indeed constituted through a subjec tion to, as Jacques Lacan might say, the itinerary of the signifier. But since that is a fate that could befall any character in any text of any period?that is to say, more a possibility recognized within a certain theoretical perspective than a historically specific condition?I try to trace the emergence of this particular conception of inhumanity through a short series of nineteenth-century novels. I will take as my point of departure an observation by Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard on the concept of the "inhuman," precisely because it bears on this question of the signifier. The inhu man, argues Lyotard, stands in opposition not so much to the human as to human ism, which is to say to a certain ideology of the human. And it is quite clear to Lyo tard that post-structuralism stands accused of letting this mhumanity in the door. Thus we might begin by looking at the two primal scenes of this post-structuralist inhumanity so as to trace their mutual entanglements and slow divergence across the space of the nineteenth-century novel.

One is the human subject confronted with its own mirror image?the scene that Lacan describes as the "mirror stage." The other is the human subject confronted with the signifiers of its own verbal self-assertions?a scene that Jacques Derrida glosses as the impossibility of a sub ject's being fully and transparently present to itself. It is the preoccupation with these two scenes of m?connaissance?mirror image and ludically iterable linguistic signifier?that form the root of contemporary inhumanism, or so the story goes. The inhuman is rooted in the idea of mindless, mechanical doubling, in the logi cal bind of a consciousness constrained to mimicry as a form of self-expression. But the recognition of this impasse goes back at least as far as Plato's lament that written words "go on telling you just the same thing forever" (xxv). What is it that links specifically late-Victorian notions of the inhuman with the iterable character of language? My argument, put simply, is that the two primal scenes I have just described put the notion of the human at risk in quite different ways, and that the novels of the Victorian period chart a shift in the relationship between these two scenes in which one becomes the face of humanity while the other becomes the dead hand of inhumanity. Why this should be is a question to which I will return at the end of the essay. Charlotte Bront?'s Villette is an instructive text for our purposes because it is so profoundly associated with visual mirroring and surveillance. Yet the novel opens with a scene of mirroring, and a question about identity, that is not visual, at least not in the traditional sense. "My godmother lived in a handsome house in the clean and ancient town of Bretton," writes Lucy Snowe: "Her husband's fam ily had been resident there for generations, and bore, indeed, the name of their birthplace?Bretton of Bretton: whether by coincidence, or because some remote ancestor had been a personage of sufficient importance to leave his name to his neighborhood, I know not" (61). The novel thus opens with the spectacle of two identical linguistic signifiers facing one another, as it were, in a mirror ("Bretton of Bretton") and can be understood to raise an important question: has the town left its imprint on the family (in other words, is the family's name a register of par ticular social and historical conditions), or is the coincidence of the two signifiers arbitrary and meaningless? Having raised the possibility of a specifically social and historical itinerary registered through the materiality of the signifier, Lucy Snowe simply lets the question drop. However, the motif of mirroring, as is well known, does anything but disappear in this novel. When Lucy is not spying on her doubles, she can usually be found staring into a mirror for negative proof of the superiority and inaccessibility of the interior life. I'll give just one brief example, though one could easily come up with others in this most specular of novels: "I saw myself in the glass, in my mourning-dress, a faded, hollow-eyed vision. Yet I thought little of the wan spectacle. The blight, I believed, was chiefly external: I still felt life at life's sources" (96). Here Lucy seeks?and receives?consolation from the mirror, which functions in a classical rather than a postmodern manner. Despite?or perhaps because of?the slight frisson of temporary m?connaissance, the mirror produces only garden-variety alienation. It is in fact fully consonant with a humanism that asserts the priority of the interior life. So there is no reduc tion to the itinerary of the signifier here.</page><page sequence="3">506 NOVEL I FALL 2009 The case is somewhat different if we return to the mirroring linguistic signifier. While it is not clear what was initially more dispiriting to Lucy?the prospect of family being reducible to place or, on the contrary, the impossibility of deciphering any relation between the two?the materiality of the signifier continues to haunt her and to threaten the reduction of identity to something more obdurate. In a strange passage explicitly calculated to throw into relief the story's temporality, Lucy gauges the relative remoteness of its events in relation to the graphic changes registered on her own narrating body: "for I speak of a time gone by," she writes; "my hair which till a late period withstood the frosts of time, lies now, at last white, under a white cap, like snow beneath snow" (105). The joke here?but of course it is a serious one?is that Lucy Snowe is reduced not simply to the inevitable material accidents of seasons and the body but to the signifier of her name. There are not just two snows in this passage (white hair under white cap), but three: snow under snow under snow. The image?but of course it is not an image in the traditional sense?is of the human subject's retreat beyond an infinite regress of signifiers. In this novel of the buried life, even burial is effaced: snow beneath snow beneath snow. But the reduction of human character to a signifier is not merely the effect of an idiosyncratic joke or pun in the world of Villette. Paulina Home tells Lucy: "Gra ham's hand is like himself . . . and so is his seal?all clear, firm, and rounded?no slovenly splash of wax?a full, solid, steady drop?a distinct impress: no pointed turns harshly pricking the optic nerve, but a clean, mellow, pleasant manuscript, that soothes you as you read" (464). This might at first appear a bid to recapture the human from the precincts of the signifier (after all, the conceit of handwriting as "character" is a staple of humanist letters), except that the final turn of the screw buries Lucy once again beneath this trope when Monsieur Paul asks her to become his amanuensis. "I hate the mechanical labor [of writing]," says Monsieur Paul. "I hate to stoop and sit still. I could dictate, though, with pleasure to an amanuensis who suited me. Would Mademoiselle Lucy write for me ... ?" (473). No longer reduced simply to the sign of her own name, Lucy is finally bound over to the signifier of the other. As I have suggested above, however, visual primal scenes trump linguistic primal scenes in this economy, and the perils of being reduced to a printed character are more than adequately compensated for by the conviction that one's mirror image leaves a remainder or residue that escapes mimicry. In Villette, surveillance?because specular?confirms the human subject, while the materiality of language threatens the effacement of identity, if not of humanity. The same indeterminate relationship between name and place that inaugurates the crisis of identity in Villette is rejoined in Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit, where the origin of the novel's most colorful place name?"Bleeding Heart Yard"?is equally unstable and equally referable to a mirroring regress of signifiers. One party of citizens has it that the yard is named for a famous murder, while another party relates it to a story of unrequited love. Both parties, observes the narrator, refuse to "listen to the antiquaries who delivered learned lectures in the neighbor hood, showing the Bleeding Heart to have been the heraldic cognizance of the old family to whom the property had once belonged" (150). Once again, as in Villette, the spectacle of people and place impressing their signifiers upon one another is raised, and once again it is immediately suspended. For if the name of the place</page><page sequence="4">LAW THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HYDE 507 simply reflects the family shield, what does that heraldic sign in turn signify? After all, similitude is not an explanation in and of itself. No less able and motivated a genealogist than Mr. Pancks articulates the problem here. Pancks's plot-shaking discovery, of course, is that the Dorrits are the Dorrits, the ones entitled to an estate worth hundreds of thousands of pounds: "[Pancks] then went on to detail, How, having that name recorded in his note-book, he was first attracted by the name alone. How, having often found two exactly similar names, even belonging to the same place, to involve no traceable consanguinity, near or distant, he did not at first give much heed to this; except in the way of speculation as to what a surprising change would be made in the condition of a little seamstress, if she could be shown to have any interest in so large a property" (431-32). The Dorrits's good fortune, then, is singular. Under normal circumstances, Pancks is well aware, even identi cal names, issuing from the identical place, don't necessarily have any significant relation to one another; or, to put it another way, identity in and of itself doesn't signify. Note how differently identity operates in the specular realm of Little Dorrit. In chapter 28, a chapter obsessed with reflection (the reflection of Tattycoram's mother in Tattycoram, the unreflective behavior of young women who run away from home, etc.), the narrator pauses to observe the perfect reflectiveness of the river: "Between the real landscape and its shadow in the water, there was no divi sion; both were so untroubled and clear, and, while so fraught with solemn mys tery of life and death, so hopefully reassuring to the gazer's soothed heart, because so tenderly and mercifully beautiful" (354). In this passage the fact of flawless mimesis is consoling rather than unnerving. Whereas Pancks has learned to be skeptical of the stammering linguistic signifier, the coincidence of visual signifiers here turns out to signify plenitude. The midcentury novel Little Dorrit would thus appear to adjudicate the relative vicissitudes of visual and linguistic mirroring in much the same way as does the midcentury Villette. In both cases the itinerary of the visual signifier, while at first blush alienating, turns out to be consoling, while the itinerary of the linguistic signifier seems to harbor genuine threats to autonomy and identity. By the end of the century, I would argue, the itinerary of the linguistic signifier can no longer be sheltered by humanist dialectics of the image. Here is where we return to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. When Mr. Utterson and the butler Poole burst in upon Henry Jekyll's private cabinet to find the twitching corpse of Edward Hyde, Utterson is discomposed by nothing so much as the pres ence of a mirror in the room: "This glass has seen some strange things, sir," whispered Poole. "And surely none stranger than itself," echoed the lawyer in the same tones. "For what did Jekyll"?he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness?"what could Jekyll want with it?" he said. (68) This is a pretty strong claim, given all the things the mirror has "seen." But the pas sage is followed almost immediately by Utterson's discovery of the final version of Henry Jekyll's will, identical to the one that precipitates the entire mystery in</page><page sequence="5">508 NOVEL I FALL 2009 the first place, with the exception that Edward Hyde's name has been replaced by Utterson's: "in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel Hyde" (69). Here, one suspects, is the truly discomfiting mirror: one that suggests the mimetic relation not so much between Jekyll and Hyde as between Jekyll/Hyde on the one hand and the series of framed narrators on the other (this point is made adequately by the various readings of the novella as a homosocial allegory). The literal mirror, I think we can safely say, is presented as evidence not so much of Jekyll's fall from the human as of his humanity. For the whole vexed question of Hyde's relation to Jekyll (is he alter ego? unconscious? libido? narcissistic reflection? homoerotic projection?) confirms the sovereignty of the ego?and thus, in the end, of the human?in a way systemati cally undermined by the chain of linguistic signifiers. It is one thing to look into a mirror and see a distortion of the human form; it is another thing to see only the alphabet. This transposition from anthropomorphic to linguistic signifiers is, as I have suggested, systematic in the novel. From the moment he reads the strange will, Utterson longs to behold Hyde's face: "[T]hus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer's mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde" (39). Yet those features are no sooner beheld than they begin to dissolve back into the linguistic signifiers that invoked them in the first place. After his first confrontation with Hyde, Utterson exclaims, "Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan's signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend" (42). From this point forth, to think about Jekyll and Hyde is to hallucinate script: as Utterson imagines warning Jekyll, "once more he saw before his mind's eye, as clear as a transparency, the strange clauses of the will" (43). But nowhere is the dehumanizing itinerary of the linguistic signifier more apparent than in the novella's lethal?if hardly original?pun on "hand," a pun that is itself a staple of the classical rhetorical tradition, as Jonathan Goldberg has forcefully demon strated. When Jekyll begins to lose control over his self-metamorphoses, the first sign of that dissolution of identity is literally his hand. On a fine clear day, sitting in Regent's Park, he looks down to see that "the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde" (89). Frantically trying to imagine some means of escape (as Hyde he is now wanted for the murder of Sir Danvers Carew), he ironically returns to the hand as his one salvation: "I remembered that of my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own hand" (89). Thus Jekyll entrusts his identity (and humanity) to the very medium which enables the substitutive play of signifiers in the first place, that is to say, to a nonvolitional, inhuman hand, figured as the corded, hairy hand of Hyde. Let us just recall the insistent way in which the various characters are interpel lated by written documents, or rather by successive iterations of the same docu ment. We start with a will, written in Jekyll's hand, and linking Jekyll, Hyde, and the idea of disappearance. This is followed by a document ostensibly in Hyde's hand but then identified as a forgery of Jekyll's, announcing an intention to disap pear. We have a document in Lanyon's hand linking once more the name of Jekyll and the idea of disappearance (Utterson professes amazement at this: he remarks that it's the same configuration of signs, but this time in Lanyon's hand). Finally</page><page sequence="6">LAW THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HYDE 509 we have a revised will, once again in Jekyll's hand, once again linking Jekyll with the idea of disappearance, but now substituting Utterson for Hyde. And the hand that produces this constantly reiterated document shades into the inhuman hand of Hyde, even as Hyde himself dissolves into script. So what quality does Utterson share with Hyde, the "hardly human" man whom the play of signifiers links him to? Could it be . . . "something"? Let us recall the description of Utterson in the opening paragraph: "At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk . . ." (31; emphasis added). Considering the itinerary of the signifier "something" from this point on in the novella, this is a rather extraordinary passage. Like Snowe and snow, or Dorrit and Dorrit, the repetition of "something" constitutes a linguistic fold threat ening to bury the individual under the signifier. In other words, "something" is not the sign of the ineffable or unspeakable, the sign of a transcendental signified, whether that signified is "humanity," the "inhuman," or "evil." "Something" is instead a sign standing only for itself, that is for the signifier, the reduction or sub jection of human potential to the algorithms of signification: automatic, iterable, self-identical. In earlier novels, the consoling fictions of the mirror harbor us from this recognition; even when they bespeak alienation, it is surface alienation from a fundamentally stable, knowable, inferiority. But no such inferiority exists here; Hyde's inhumanity beacons from Utterson's eye. This should not surprise us if we consider Friedrich Kittler's account of the shift in the culture of letters over the course of the nineteenth century. According to Kit tier, an ideology of phoneticism sheltered the users of language from the material ity of their medium during what we might call the Romantic half of the century; language pedagogy, domestic ideology, and poetic practice conspired to locate the source of language in the mouth of the mother, which is to say in a fully human medium. But a series of displacements over the course of the century?social, ide ological, technical, political?all converged to locate ideal language outside the human form: in the algebra of the typewriter, in the generalization of print, in the "sciences" of shorthand and other transformative notational systems. This cease less recalibration of the ratios among human body, voice, and writing has been a constant feature of Western culture since (once again) Plato at least. But what changes at the end of the nineteenth century is that all language production, and not just writing or print, comes to be seen as a technology. One might expect, given Kittler's thesis, that literature's way of expressing this de-anthropomorphizing of language would be to represent language as alienated from the human form. But language, allegorized as the hand, is on the contrary the common denominator between the human Jekyll and the inhuman Hyde, just as the "something" pro duced by that hand is the common denominator between Hyde and the eminently human Mr. Utterson. So language remains imminent to the human form in the novella?the trouble being that this is not a fact legible in a mirror. The mirror?to borrow Oscar Wilde's formulation?can show us either Caliban or nothing (either a parody of the human or an evacuation of the human); what it cannot show us is the strange and increasingly normative case of "something."</page><page sequence="7">510 NOVEL I FALL 2009 Works Cited Bront?, Charlotte.
