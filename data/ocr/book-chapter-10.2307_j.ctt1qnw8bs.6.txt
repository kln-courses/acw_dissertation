It will focus on north central Sri Lanka and   Anurādhapura but draw on wider references, comparisons and analogies where   appropriate. Within an archaeological context, cosmopolitanism is a relatively  underexplored phenomenon. While some volumes have addressed issues of    identity and cosmopolitanism,1 they have been more concerned with how this  may have been represented in the present (largely through cultural heritage), as  opposed to exploring the nature of its ancient manifestations. Philosophically,  cosmopolitanism may be taken to refer to the concept that all humans belong to a  single community with shared moral codes and philosophies, and that such a con-   cept should be nurtured.2 However, to a wider public, cosmopolitanism has often  been used to reflect multiculturalism, sophistication and a general worldliness.  In an archaeological context, the former definition is inherently problematic and  challenging; however, the latter set of definitions is more achievable to identify,  but to varying degrees as will become apparent. How archaeologists commence the process of defining and identifying  cosmopolitanism within archaeological communities is, in itself, a challenge  although one may simply acknowledge the presence of multiple communities in  the past. On a more ambitious level, archaeologists may investigate the relation- ships between such communities more deeply and the influences they may have  had on each other. In such a way, the concept of cosmopolitanism may assist the  development of a greater understanding of the complex and multifaceted identi- ties of individuals and communities in the past. For instance, individuals may have  had allegiances to multiple communities, may have spoken numerous languages  19 </page> <page sequence="2"> 20 and may have participated in various religious, ritual and belief systems. However  positive an ambition, the inclusive and integrating nature of cosmopolitanism  makes it difficult to define and even more difficult to identify within the ephem-  eral material remains with which archaeologists have to contend.  The focus of this discussion must also acknowledge the underlying and   underpinning concepts of identity. Early archaeologists, such as Gustaf Kossinna   (1858– 1931), linked material archaeological remains with cultures, and varia-  tions within these cultural groups were attributed to ethnic diversity. Each clearly  defined cultural province was thus correlated with an ethnic group and, simultan-   eously, also linked to contemporary nationalist concerns.3 Although in opposition   to this political agenda, pioneering archaeologists, such as Vere Gordon Childe and    Stuart Piggott,4 continued to identify and map cultural provinces across time and  space in Europe and South Asia through differences and distributions of material  culture, maintaining the assumption that cultural groups correlated with ethnic   and linguistic groups. In Western Europe and, by imperial proxy, in South Asia,  archaeologists utilized concepts of diffusion and migration to explain cultural and  linguistic variations, for example in the debate over the development and spread of    Indo- Aryan languages, linked with the ubiquitous Aryan invasion theory.5 Sri Lanka may be perceived as representing a microcosm of this latter Aryan  question. Indeed, Tamil and Sinhalese ethnic identities have been created and  curated on the basis of relatively modern distributions of Indo-E uropean and  proto- Dravidian linguistic communities, combined with references to oral and lit-   erary traditions relating to the Vijayan colonization of the island.6 Despite this long  scholarly tradition, there has been a more recent and rigorous examination of con- cepts of ethnicity within archaeology, leading some scholars to reject the notion  that ethnic identity was ever concrete or could be traceable to a definable point.   Jones has suggested that ‘ethnic identity is based on shifting, situational, subject- ive identifications of self and others, which are rooted in ongoing daily practice     and historical experience, but also subject to transformation and discontinuity’.7  Archaeologists have also focused on issues of identity within the archaeological  record, challenging preconceptions relating to age, gender, ethnicity and religion,  and recognizing that ‘identity... is not a static thing, but a continual process...  Identities are constructed through interaction between people and the process by     which we acquire and maintain our identities requires choice and agency’.8  Crucial within this quote is the recognition that identity is not singular but  a plural concept. Individuals may hold many different identities simultaneously  and this is something that becomes increasingly evident when examining the  complex Sri Lankan past. This is equally true of the challenge of trying to discern  religious identities from archaeological remains, individual objects or artefactual  corpora. For instance, many monuments and motifs were commonly shared by a    number of major religious traditions,9 making it difficult to offer firm affiliations.   With regard to Sri Lanka, a number of deities, such as Ganesh, Viṣṇu and Kubera,  continued to be venerated after the advent of Buddhism but their positions were   reconstituted within a cosmography that placed the Buddha centrally. 20   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="3"> 21 The survival of old beliefs and the appropriation of new traditions can be  traced throughout the island’s archaeological sequence, ranging from the intro- duction of the Buddha image in the first half of the first millennium ce to the  emergence of traditions associated with the terracotta artefacts of the so- called  ‘Tabbova- Maradanmaduva Culture’ at the beginning of the second millennium    ce.10 In order to investigate cosmopolitanism in ancient Sri Lanka and evaluate  the appropriateness of the concept itself, this chapter will examine a series of case  studies. These range from the role of pilgrimage, in particular Buddhist, to and  from the island; local and global trade networks and the impact these have had  on the island’s inhabitants; patronage within the island and Sri Lankan patron- age elsewhere in South Asia; and the religious and economic landscapes of   Anurādhapura and its surrounding hinterland. This study will focus on archaeo- logical data but will introduce textual and epigraphic evidence where appropriate,  and will begin by examining these sources and critically discussing how modern  ethnic constructs in Sri Lanka have been intrinsically linked to the island’s past.  Textual narratives and the linking of archaeology   to ethnicity  The precolonial history of Sri Lanka has been constructed from a variety of textual   sources, in particular the Dīpavaṃsa, Mahāvaṃsa and Cūḷavaṃsa. Wilhelm Geiger   argued that the Dīpavaṃsa’s contents relied upon an earlier chronicle known as     the Aṭṭhakathā- Mahāvaṃsa,11 and that while the Dīpavaṃsa is viewed as a first   attempt at collating Pāli verses, the Mahāvaṃsa can be seen as a younger, more  elaborate, treatment of the same material. Geiger even went as far as to suggest   that the Mahāvaṃsa represents ‘a conscious and intentional rearrangement of     the Dīpavaṃsa’.12 Although its authorship is unknown, the Dīpavaṃsa is believed   to have been compiled in the fourth century ce, while the Mahāvaṃsa has been   argued to have been written by various monks of the Mahāvihāra and compiled   into a single document by the Buddhist monk Mahānāma in the fifth to sixth     century ce.13 It narrates the history of the island from its colonization by Prince     Vijaya through to the reign of King Mahāsena (r. 275– 301 ce).14 The Cūḷavaṃsa  was a continuation of this narrative, detailing the island’s history up to the eight-    eenth century ce.15 Initially scholars believed these narratives to be legends, but  the rediscovery of palm leaf manuscripts by George Turnour at Mullgiri-g alla near     Tangalle16 led to the serious reconsideration of their contents as historical. Sir  James Emerson Tennent, Colonial Secretary of Ceylon between 1845 and 1850  ce, stated that this ‘long lost chronicle... thus vindicated the claim of Ceylon to     the possession of an authentic and unrivalled record of its national history’.17 This rediscovery led to an increase in Western studies of the island’s his-   tory,18 paralleled by significant research undertaken by members of the Sangha   whose translations of Pāli works into Sinhalese and correspondence with    European academics facilitated the development of ‘Oriental’ scholarship.19  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   21 </page> <page sequence="4"> 2Unique across South Asia, the chronicles provided a historical framework for the  island from before the Mauryan Empire through to British rule and, with colo- nial endorsement, the chronicles became the privileged source of evidence for   scholars studying Sri Lanka’s past. This focus has produced what has been termed     by Seneviratne as the ‘Mahāvaṃsa view’,20 reflecting the fact that ever since the  rediscovery of the chronicles, the disciplines of Sri Lankan history and archae-    ology have been largely influenced by as the Mahāvaṃsa’s narrative.21 It has also   been suggested that archaeological evidence from excavations in Anurādhapura,  while often referring to ‘popular’ culture and history, has been used to reinforce    academic narratives derived from the chronicles.22  The narrative itself details, as is widely known, the arrival of Prince Vijaya,  the exiled heir to a kingdom in northern India, with his 700 followers on the  uninhabited island of Lanka in the middle of the first millennium bce. On arrival,  Vijaya slays the demonic yakkhas who reside on the island, while at the same   time having two children by the yakkhiṇī, Kuveṇī. Descended from a lion, Vijaya  refers to his followers as Sinhala, or ‘people of the lion’. However, having borne his   children, Prince Vijaya spurns Kuveṇī in favour of an Indian princess, and Kuveṇī     and their children retreat to the jungle, forming the Pulinda people.23 After the  conversion of the Sinhalese to Buddhism in the third century bce as a result of   Aśōka’s proselytizing (see p. 29), the Mahāvaṃsa makes its first reference to dif-  ferentiated communities by mentioning Demaḷas, a term often associated with     Tamils, although this is contested.24 With the exception of those Tamil-s peakers  brought across as indentured labour for the colonial tea plantations, the Tamil  communities of present-d ay Sri Lanka have often been directly linked with the   invading South Indian Pāṇḍyas and Cōḻas during the later phases of the Sinhalese     rule from Anurādhapura.25 The chronicles thus seem to establish within their nar- ratives three distinct communities that have often been perceived to have been at  odds with one another, rather than recognizing a framework for a multicultural  island with a shared history. Frequently, the underlying question here has been to   do with who the rightful autochthons were.  This link of past to present has often been translated into the notion of the    Sinhalese as rightful ‘heirs’ to the island,26 while Tamils were portrayed as late- comers or outsiders. The reasoning behind this partially originates from colonial   interpretations of Sri Lankan history. As well as endorsing the Mahāvaṃsa as   history, Tennent equated the Pulinda with the modern communities of hunter-   gatherers or väddās, often described as the aboriginal inhabitants of the island;  the Sinhalese as the civilized creators of the architectural and engineering mas- terpieces of the northern plains or the Rajarata; and finally, the Tamils as the     ‘debased’ destroyers of that civilization.27 These views became mainstream histor- ical opinion, although other scholars sought to attribute a much deeper antiquity    to the Tamil communities of the island,28 with some suggesting that sites such as    Mantai were part of a separate early Tamil trading civilization,29 or that an early  Dravidian population was already present on the island at the time of the Vijayan     colonization.30 However, these latter views never garnered broader acceptance. 22   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="5"> 23  Central to colonial interpretation was the concept that Indo- European-  speaking people had invaded South Asia from the north and west around the first  millennium bce, bringing with them a cultural package that included writing,    iron, horse- riding and advanced social institutions.31 Within South Asia, the Indo-  Aryan invasion was portrayed as part of a long pageant of historical precedents  that helped to legitimate British control of the region as the latest wave of con-    quest elites following Aryans, Greeks, Persians and Turks.32 The civil servant and  historian, H. W. Codrington, pursued these legitimacies in his Short History of  Ceylon, when he reminded readers that the British invasion of Kandy and exile   of the last king, Śrī Vikrama Rājasiṃha (r. 1798–1 815 ce) was to deliver ‘the  Kandyans from their oppressors and the subversion of the Malabar dominion’,     Rājasiṃha being a South Indian Tamil by birth.33  Episodes and events of oppression were also portrayed within the chroni- cles and they frequently referenced the destruction of Buddhist heritage by South   Indian aggressors. For instance, during the reign of Mahinda V (r. 982– 1029 ce)   the chronicles recorded that Anurādhapura was abandoned, leaving the capital   open to plunder by the South Indian Cōḻa polity: Thereupon they sent the Monarch and all the treasures which had fallen   into their hands at once to the Cōḻa Monarch. In the three fraternities and  in all Lanka (breaking open) the relic chambers, (they carried away) many  costly images of gold etc., and while they violently destroyed here and there  all the monasteries, like blood-s ucking yakkhas they took all the treasures    of Lanka for themselves.34 These descriptions were also used during the anti-c olonial Buddhist revival by  leaders of that movement, such as Angarika Dharmapala (1864– 1933 ce), who  identified modern Europeans and ancient Tamils as ‘barbaric vandals’ of Sinhalese    culture.35 This fitted a framework promoting Sinhalese and Buddhist concerns  while noting European interference. However, colonial archaeologists also laid  the blame for the destruction of monuments in antiquity at the hands of Tamils,    utilizing similar narratives.36 Early archaeological interpretations drew from   such descriptions and H. C. P. Bell, the archaeological commissioner for Ceylon  between 1890 and 1912, described the stone Buddhist railing at the Jetavana   monastery of Anurādhapura as damaged by an aggressor: The indescribable confusion in which the fragments were found heaped one  upon another, and the almost entire wreck of the railing, leave little room  for doubt that this unique relic of Ceylon Buddhist architecture must have  perished under the ruthless destruction of those invaders from South India  at whose door lies the mutilation and ruin of the best works of the sculptor’s     art in Anurādhapura.37 Such interpretations were not rare, as illustrated by the discovery of fractured   Buddha sculptures in Jaffna recorded by Sir Paul Pieris. He noted that earlier  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   23 </page> <page sequence="6"> 24 scholars, such as Sir William Twynam, the government agent for Jaffna, had  suggested that Buddhist sculptures found in the north ‘have been similarly     mutilated – an undoubted sign, he thinks, of Dravidian invasion’.38 Such view- points were not restricted to the infancy of archaeological enquiry but contin- ued through the twentieth century. For example, excavations at Abhayagiri in   Anurādhapura in the 1980s revealed Buddha statues lying flat with their heads   removed and this was cited as evidence of the Cōḻa destruction as narrated in     the Cūḷavaṃsa.39 The latter findings were recovered from excavations conducted  as part of Sri Lanka’s major heritage programme, the UNESCO Central Cultural  Fund, established by president J. R. Jayewardene in 1980. Tasked with excavat- ing, conserving and presenting the ancient cities and Buddhist monuments of Sri   Lanka, the sites of Anurādhapura, Polonnaruva and Sigiriya were inscribed on the   UNESCO World Heritage list in 1982, followed by Kandy in 1988 and Dambulla    in 1991.40 Although colonial Galle was inscribed in 1988, the focus on Buddhist   sites was pointed out by Tambiah, who stated that while there should be no bar- riers to the sponsorship of the restoration of Buddhist monuments, ‘[i] t would  also behove a Sri Lankan government to recognize at the same time that there are  monuments, archaeological remains, and literary and cultural treasures that are     neither Sinhalese nor Buddhist as these labels are understood today’.41  One of the unintended consequences of the increasing alignment of the   state- sponsored promotion of Buddhist heritage with the Mahāvaṃsa’s narra- tive was to focus the attention of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam     (LTTE) on the symbolic importance of such monuments.42 Indeed, the early meth- ods of the Central Cultural Fund were also queried by one of its own directors-  general, Professor Seneviratne, who observed that ‘interpretative studies were   mainly commissioned to strengthen the Buddhist history of Anurādhapura and     to authenticate the Mahāvaṃsa narration’.43 Reflecting the new post-c onflict era  across the island, and the Central Cultural Fund Act, which states that the Fund  was established ‘for the development of cultural and religious monuments in Sri    Lanka’,44 project offices have now been opened in Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee  and Ampara, with recently inaugurated conservation programmes at the Sivan   Kōvil at Trincomalee, the Yonakapura mosque in Dickwella and the Roman  Catholic church at Duwa in Negombo, as well as the promotion of the intan-  gible heritage of väddā, African and Malay communities. Furthermore, the Fund  is sponsoring more inclusive research, such as the current investigations at Siva  Devale No. 2 at Polonnaruva, which involves participants from across Sri Lanka  including Sri Jayewardhanapura, Rajarata, Kelaniya and Jaffna Universities as   well as international partners from Nepal, India, Australia and the UK.  On reflection, the character of the ancient heritage of Sri Lanka was far  more complex, diverse and fluid than recently constructed identities and repre-  sentations suggest. For example, although Sinhalese monarchs were guardians of  Buddhism within the island, close marriage ties with non- Buddhist South Indian   dynasties were formed, culminating in the accession of the Nāyaka dynasty to     the Kandyan throne in the eighteenth century.45 The current Temple of the   Tooth in Kandy was partly constructed by a Nāyaka, Śrī Vikrama Rājasiṃha II  24   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="7"> 25 (r. 1798– 1815 ce), a Tamil/ Telugu-s peaker from a Hindu dynasty of South Asian  origin. The attack on the Temple of Tooth by the LTTE in 1998 therefore not only  resulted in damage to a monument constructed by a South Indian dynastic king     from the Nāyaka dynasty, but also damaged adjacent shrines to Pattini and Viṣṇu,46   important to both Buddhist and Hindu communities. The patronage and protec- tion afforded by ‘non-B uddhists’ is further reinforced by a Tamil inscription on a   stone slab beside the Tooth Relic Temple in Polonnaruva. Known as the Aṭadāgē,   this structure was built under the patronage of Vijayabāhu I (r. 1055–1 110 ce)   and the epigraph instructs guards from South India, Vēlaikkāras, to protect the     Buddha’s Tooth Relic within47 (Figure 1.1). Part of a long tradition of ‘Sinhala’    Fig. 1.1 Tamil inscription at the Atadage, Sacred Quadrangle, Polonnaruva,  authors’ photograph. ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   25 </page> <page sequence="8"> 26  states employing South Indian guards, the Vēlaikkāras are stated to be adher-  ents of the Mahātantra, and this further highlights the diversity and complexity  of identity, religiosity and the construction of royal legitimacy within medieval   Sri Lanka. All these complexities are crucial for the consideration of evidence for   potential signs of cosmopolitan practices in the archaeological record.  Indian Ocean trade  Although Anurādhapura has been investigated for more than one hundred  years, intensive stratigraphic archaeological analysis only commenced through  the instigation of fieldwork programmes by Dr Siran Deraniyagala in the 1990s.  One associated investigation was the excavation at trench Salgha Watta (ASW2),  directed by one of the authors, which began in 1989 and continued into the  1990s. The trench measured ten by ten metres and was excavated to a depth    of ten metres.48 While trench ASW2 identified and dated a sequence with more  than 1,000 years of occupation, rebuilding and eventual abandonment at the  site, it was also designed to develop a typological sequence for the island and,  in so doing, allowed the identification of trade networks. Many early studies of  the island’s archaeology have attributed Sri Lanka’s apparent peripheral position    to its seemingly marginal geographical location, off India’s southern tip.49 As a  result, the island was assumed to have adopted a number of innovations, such as    writing and urbanization, later than North India.50 On a broader scale, this interpretation reflected a deeply rooted colonial  concept, namely that contact with the Roman world was the catalyst for the   beginnings of Indian Ocean trade. In line with his tradition of linking South Asian  archaeology with established Western chronologies, Mortimer Wheeler pre- sented the early, pre-R oman levels of his excavations at the port of Arikamedu  in South India as populated by ‘simple fisher- folk’ living in ‘a leisurely and enter-   prising fashion just above subsistence level’.51 An adherent of the theory of cul- tural change through invasion, diffusion or trade, Wheeler believed that Roman  traders provided the stimulus for the settlement to develop into an international    hub.52 He felt supported by the presence of finds of Arretine Ware and other   Roman goods. While he focused on the sequence from a single trade entrepôt, the  ideas and concepts that he developed were transposed to Sri Lanka and into nar-   ratives of the island’s development. Yet Begley’s re-e xcavations at Arikamedu53   and Coningham’s trench ASW2 at Anurādhapura demonstrated the weakness  of these models, the latter confirming the presence of well-d eveloped trade net-    works across South Asia before contact with the Roman world.54  Archaeologists now recognize the highly diverse character of the wider  region’s trading communities. For example, the Italian excavations at Khor Rohri    on the Omani coast have provided evidence of South Asian wares55 and the pres- ence of sherds with inscriptions in Early Brahmi, the lingua franca of early his- toric trade, at Myos Hormos and Berenike in the Red Sea suggest strong contact  26   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="9"> 27 with – and possible residence of – South Asian traders there in the first century    ce.56 The excavations at trench ASW2 also provide evidence of a diverse reper- toire, indicating links across the early historic and medieval Indian Ocean. Objects  demonstrate links with Afghanistan and Gujarat, with finds of lapis lazuli and car- nelian in the first millennium bce, but later expanded to include glazed ceramics  from the Persian and Islamic worlds and Eastern Asia with delicate monochrome  lustre ware bowls and Changsha stone wares in the first millennium ce. While  some objects, such as the Egyptian glass kohl sticks, were already well-known  artefact categories, other objects represented the introduction of new tastes.   For example, during Period F (300–6 00 ce), ‘torpedo’ jars were imported from  Sasanian and Early Islamic regions. Lined with bitumen to make them watertight,  they were used to transport liquids. Gas chromatography–m ass spectrometry and  stable isotope analysis of torpedo jars from trench ASW2 identified that the bitu-   men was derived from Susa in Iran,57 and while it was not possible to determine   what liquids were transported within the Anurādhapura torpedo jars, it is likely    that one of the commodities was wine.58 Torpedo jars have also been found at    Mantai,59 Sigiriya60 and Tissamaharama61 and undoubtedly represent a broaden-  ing of such consumption habits.  A more utilitarian development was also recognized within the sequence of   trench ASW2 in the form of sherds with inscriptions. Predating Aśōkan contact,  the presence of Early Brahmi script in levels dating to c. 400 bce raised questions    as to its presence within the island.62 North Indian Prakrit, the direct ancestor of  Sinhalese, may have been adopted as a trade language at that time. The commu-  nities using it at Anurādhapura may have been bilingual and gradually replaced    their own language in favour of Prakrit – a process that resulted in Sinhala.63 The  striking nature of its presence within the city has been further stressed by the fact  that only a single inscribed sherd was identified outside the walls during a major  campaign of survey – restricting the cosmopolitan nature of its use to the capi- tal and differentiating this settlement from its rural hinterland, where evidence     of writing was again restricted to inscriptions at monastic sites.64 The presence   of early trade links at Anurādhapura and Mantai also demonstrate that distant  connections existed long before scholars had suggested. Indeed, the excavations   across the ramparts at Anurādhapura demonstrated that the urban nature of the     site was defined long before contact with Aśōka in the third century bce65 and  the supposed ‘Mauryanization’ of the island, while the earliest levels of the site   (c. 800 bce) also detail an extensive intra- island network of trade and exchange.  Although this evidence of trade goods in Anurādhapura may have informed  us of the extensive trade networks flowing through the site, it still remains to be  seen how these systems were organized. Were international merchants and trad- ers residing within the city itself or was the port of Mantai established as a trading     entrepôt with goods shipped to Anurādhapura by local traders?66 Were Sri Lankan  traders setting forth to procure goods from around the world to bring home for  local markets? The recent discovery of the Godavaya shipwreck off the southern  coast of Sri Lanka promises to shed more light on the identities of the sailors and  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   27 </page> <page sequence="10"> 28   their cargos.67 As is often the case in archaeology, it is difficult to be absolutely  certain and the answers are likely to be a combination of all of the above. The  later travel itineraries of the Chinese pilgrim Faxian, for example, noted the pres-    ence of ‘The houses of Sa- pho (Sabaean) merchants’ within Anurādhapura,68 but  scholars differ in their identification of the ethnicities involved. Note must also be   made of the discovery of a Nestorian Cross at Anurādhapura. This was interpreted    by early archaeologists as marking the presence of a church,69 but also recently  reassessed by Prabo Mihindukulasuriya, who linked the find with records by the  historian Cosmas and the presence of a Nestorian bulla from Mantai to suggest     that Anurādhapura hosted a thriving Christian community.70 Although the pres- ence of isolated artefacts may not necessarily equate to the permanent presence     of particular groups, they do certainly call for a reassessment of the record.71  Pilgrimage  The earliest contact between Sri Lanka and northern India recorded in the   Mahāvaṃsa’s narrative was the Vijayan colonization. The second notable contact   was between Devānaṃpiyatissa’s (r. 250–2 10 bce) kingdom and the Mauryan  Empire, which had emerged in the mid- fourth century bce from the internecine    warfare between the various mahajanapadas of South Asia.72 After his conver-  sion to Buddhism, it is recorded that the Mauryan emperor Aśōka (272– 235     bce) sent missionaries to neighbouring states to spread the Dharma.73 Aśōka’s   son Mahinda was sent to Sri Lanka and, after converting Devānaṃpiyatissa, sup-    ported spreading Buddhism throughout the island.74 Later, Aśōka’s daughter   Saṅghamittā brought a branch of the Bōdhi tree from Bodhgaya, under which    the Buddha gained enlightenment, to Sri Lanka75 forming a centrepiece that   is still venerated at the Śrī Mahā Bōdhi in Anurādhapura. Further relics were  brought to Sri Lanka, such as the Buddha’s alms bowl, while his collarbone was     enshrined within the Thūpārāmaya in Anurādhapura.76 Although the archaeo- logical evidence cannot confirm these textual claims in detail, it can support the  broader point that relics were moving across South Asia as diplomatic and reli-  gious gifts. There is a close parallel between the recorded arrival of the Bōdhi  tree and the advent of tree and swastika coinage in the third century bce. The   presence of Northern Black Polished Ware at Anurādhapura also constitutes  ‘physical evidence of links between the core of the Mauryan culture sphere and    Sri Lanka’.77 Although a link can be identified, its exact nature is less certain,   as the ware predates the rule of Aśōka and may represent down-t he- line trade   rather than courtly exchange.  Once Buddhism was established, the monasteries of Anurādhapura gained   an international reputation and links throughout Asia continued to expand. In  the late fourth and early fifth century ce, the Chinese pilgrim Faxian journeyed  to Sri Lanka during his travels around South Asia visiting sites associated with  the life of the Buddha and major Buddhist centres. In addition to describing  28   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="11"> 29  Anurādhapura and the religious ceremonies that occurred within the citadel, he  described the wealth of the monasteries of the Sacred City. Here, Faxian reported   that more than 10,000 monks and nuns resided, with the Abhayagiri Vihāra hous-    ing 5,000 and the Mahāvihāra 3,000 monks.78 The treasury of Abhayagiri was    said to contain jewels and gems of incalculable value, garnered from patronage.79  The Sangha’s networks continued into the medieval period but, after the pur-  ported damage to the Sangha caused by Cōḻa incursions in the eleventh century  ce, as recorded in the chronicles, it was reported that no ordination had been con- ducted in Sri Lanka for many decades. These networks were called upon to assist   the restoration of the Sangha, and Vijayabāhu I was aided by King Anuruddha   of Rāmañña, whose realm coincided with modern Burma/ Myanmar, to bring     monks to Sri Lanka to fulfil these duties.80 In later periods, after the decline of  Polonnaruva, a major mission of monks from Chiangmai and Pegu came to Sri    Lanka in the 1420s ce to worship the Tooth Relic and receive higher ordination.81  The Indian Ocean- wide Buddhist worldview illustrated by these examples may  have been encapsulated symbolically not only in textual sources, but also archi-  tecturally, with Tilman Frasch suggesting recently that the layout and structures  of the twelfth- century Sacred Quadrangle at Polonnaruva represented a cosmo-    gram of international Buddhist contacts.82  This is not to suggest that Sri Lanka acted solely as a receptacle for external  impulses as there is also evidence for Sri Lankan communities influencing distant  partners. For example, Pliny noted that a Sinhalese monarch sent an embassy to     Rome in the second century ce83 and an inscription on the Aśōkan period stone  railing at the Mahabodhi Temple in northern India was translated by Sir Alexander    Cunningham as the ‘Gift of Bodhi-r akshita of Tambaparna (Ceylon)’.84 References  to Sri Lanka have also been identified at other sites in India. At Nagarjunakonda   in Andhra Pradesh, an inscription recorded the Sīhala- Vihāra and the dedication     of a shrine to the fraternities of Tambapaṇṇi.85 A decorated moonstone discovered  at one apsidal temple, unlike other examples at Nagarjunakonda, resembles the   ornately carved moonstones of Anurādhapura, decorated with elephants, lions,  deer, horse, bull and buffalo, which may be connected to Buddhist communities    from Sri Lanka.86 Later contact is confirmed by an inscription dating to 792 ce, found at a  monastic site in the Ratubaka plateaux of Java, commemorating the founding     of a branch of the Abhayagiri Vihāra of Sri Lanka in this locale.87 Sundberg has  argued that the pendopo architectural unit at Ratubaka has similarities with the   layout of Padhānaghara Pirivena, or double- platform monasteries, that have been   identified on the western outskirts at Anurādhapura and at Ritigala. These sites   have been linked to the fraternity of monks known as the paṃsukūlika or ‘those     clothed in rags from dustheaps’,88 who rose to prominence from the eighth cen-  tury ce onwards. The architecture of a Padhānaghara Pirivena is usually charac- terized by two quadrangular units connected by a stone bridge. These platforms  are surrounded by an enclosing wall, occasionally a moat, as well as cisterns  and ponds. Padhānaghara parivena do not possess typical Buddhist structures  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   29 </page> <page sequence="12"> 30  or iconography such as stūpas, but are often associated with meditational path-    ways.89 Sundberg has suggested that the Javanese pendopo shares these features  such as a lack of ornamentation, cardinally oriented double- platforms, artificial     rock- cut ponds and the presence of a compound wall.90 Although it is not clear   whether the paṃsukūlika associated with the Padhānaghara Pirivena of Sri Lanka  were present in Java, or vice versa, it is clear that there was communication and   that shared architectural concepts existed across the Indian Ocean region. Furthermore, inscriptions in Sri Lanka, such as two twelfth- century ce     inscriptions from Polonnaruva, record the construction of a temple in South India91    and the construction of alms- houses abroad.92 Artefactual evidence is also suggest- ive of international Buddhist contacts, and it has been argued that a tenth- century     ce bronze Buddha figure found in Thailand originated in Anurādhapura.93 Textual  sources also illustrate the influence of Sri Lankan monarchs overseas not just in   religious matters. For example, Parākramabāhu I (r. 1153–8 6 ce) is recorded as  instigating military campaigns against Southeast Asian polities as well as sending     an army to South India to assist a Pāṇḍyan ruler against the Cōḻas in 1169 ce.94 Finally, it is worth noting that not all pilgrims to Sri Lanka came for ‘Buddhist’   monuments or ‘Buddhist’ relics. It has been hypothesized that the site of Sigiriya,  a creation of Kassapa I (r. 473– 91 ce) and historically a site that attracted large  numbers of visitors and pilgrims, was constructed symbolically to recreate the     city of Āḷakamandā, the celestial home of Kubera, god of wealth.95 Inscription 28  of the Sigiriya graffiti records: ‘The resplendent rock named Sighigiri captivates  the minds of those who have seen [it] as if [the mountain] Mundalind, which was    adorned by the King of Sages, had descended to the earth.’96 Mundalind has been   equated with Mount Meru and, continuing this symbolism, Paranavitana sug- gested that the lake at Sigiriya represented the celestial lake Anotatta, the white-  washed boulders before the outcrop stood for the snow- clad Himalayas, and the   royal palace pointed to the abode of Kubera on the summit of Meru. The famous  Sigiriya frescoes have also been interpreted in various ways, one being that they  are depictions of divine cloud damsels representing cloud and lightning, reaffirm-   ing Kassapa’s ability to control the elements.97 If indeed viewed as the creation  of Kassapa, the graffiti and cosmological symbolism of Sigiriya produced what    is argued to be the clearest example of an urban microcosm in early Sri Lanka.98 This symbolism suggests the physical modelling of South Asian-w ide con- cepts, such as Mount Meru at the centre of a cosmic universe, were already present     previously in Anurādhapura99 and continued into the medieval and post-m edi-    eval periods at the urban forms of Polonnaruva and Kandy.100 The Sigiriya graffiti  also demonstrate that individuals from various communities travelled from all     over Sri Lanka to visit the site,101 and not always for religious reasons. However,  it has also been argued that Sigiriya was in fact not an urban centre, but rather a     vast Mahāyāna- Theravāda Buddhist monastic complex,102 and if this view held by  Raja de Silva is correct, then another intriguing explanation for Sigiriya’s design  may exist. Rather than depicting cloud damsels surrounding the summit of Meru,  de Silva argues that the paintings of female figures were representations of the  30   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="13"> 31    Bōdhisattva Tara.103 There is also the possibility that these two interpretations  were both held side-b y- side, again highlighting the diversity in symbolic meaning   that could be attached to physical remains in the Sri Lankan past.  Patronage  While evidence from Sri Lanka’s monumental centres demonstrates the breadth of  connections throughout the Indian Ocean region, until recently the extra- urban net- works around those hubs have been neglected. New fieldwork in the hinterland of   Anurādhapura has begun to redress this imbalance, providing an archaeological data- set that has been combined with geoarchaeological, epigraphic and textual studies in  order to understand the development of the city in relation to its wider landscape    context.104 One of the key findings of this fieldwork is the central role of Buddhist    monasteries in the administration of landscape,105 a state of affairs that had already    been suggested from archaeological landscape surveys in Sri Lanka106 and India.107 The two major site categories identified during six years of field survey in   Anurādhapura’s hinterland were Buddhist monasteries and small-s ized ceramic  scatters. These sites presented deep occupation sequences at monasteries as   opposed to shallow ephemeral traces at ceramic scatter sites. Artefacts such as  coins, precious and semi- precious stones, fine ware ceramics, as well as monu- mental architecture and, as stated previously, writing, were restricted to monastic  sites, and these sites appear to have acted as both religious and secular adminis-   trators with jurisdiction over large temporalities in the hinterland.108 This pattern  reached its climax in the early medieval period when the most dominant form  of Buddhist patronage in the hinterland was through immunity grants, recorded  in inscriptions on stone pillars, rather than the direct construction or mainten- ance of religious structures. Accounting for almost half of all donations and found     across Anurādhapura’s hinterland for this period,109 these immunities alienated  vast tracts of land and transferred authority from the Crown and local officials to    the Sangha.110 Creating an integrated landscape administered by monastic insti- tutions, inscriptions found throughout Sri Lanka from the early historic period  onwards corroborate the links between monasteries of the hinterland and urban  monasteries of the Sacred City, recording the affiliation of monasteries to the     Mahāvihāra, Abhayagiri Vihāra and Jetavana Vihāra.111 However, the growing  diversity and division within Buddhist sects ensured some heterogeneity to the  hinterland in addition to the diversity of other religious practices present in the     landscape, such as those indicated by the presence of terracotta figurines.112  The fact that three distinct monasteries are referred to in the chronicles indi-  cates in itself that the Buddhist Sangha at Anurādhapura was not monolithic. The   chronicles state that the Mahāvihāra was founded in the reign of Devānaṃpiyatissa   with the arrival of Mahinda’s mission and incorporated the Bōdhi tree and    the Ruwanwelisaya stūpa.113 The first major recorded schism occurred during  the reign of Vattagamani (r. 89– 77 bce) and led to the founding of Abhayagiri  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   31 </page> <page sequence="14"> 32    Vihāra,114 often cited as a centre of Mahāyānist doctrines. Mahasena (r. 275– 301   ce) not only founded the Jetavana Vihāra at Anurādhapura, but also, under the     influence of a ‘lawless bhikkhu’,115 withdrew support from the Mahāvihāra. This   led to the abandonment of the Mahāvihāra for nine years, with the monks leav- ing for Malaya and Rohana. Construction materials were then taken from the  complex and brought to Abhayagiri, which became wealthy under state sup-    port.116 Later under the rule of Mahasena’s son Sirimeghavaṇṇa (r. 301–3 28 ce)     the Mahāvihāra was reconciled,117 but all three major fraternities continued to   receive state patronage.  Different sects of monastic orders have been identified architectur-  ally within Anurādhapura. In addition to lena, natural rock-s helters with Early  Brahmi inscriptions engraved along drip ledges, which represent the earliest    extant category of monastic establishment known at present in Sri Lanka,118  Bandaranayake identified three categories of monastic complex. The first was the  organic or centric monastery, dating from the first century ce onwards. Termed    ‘organic’ due to associations with locales with pre-e xisting traditions,119 they are   also designated as centric due to a layout focused around a colossal stūpa, and in   this regard, the Mahāvihāra, Jetavana, Abhayagiri, Vessagiriya in Anurādhapura,    as well as Mihintale fit this model.120 These monasteries were often later elabo-  rated by the construction of a focal-t ype stūpa, with such modifications dating to     the early medieval period (600– 1200 ce).121 The second was the Padhānaghara  Pirivena, also known as double-p latform monasteries, mentioned in the pre-  vious section, and thought to be associated with the paṃsukūlika fraternity. As  stated above, these sites were built from plain ashlar blocks and did not possess  typical Buddhist structures or iconography, the only decorated features there   being the urinal slabs that seemingly depict images of ‘orthodox’ ornate vihāras  (Figure 1.2). Such iconography can be interpreted as a visible, physical repre- sentation and reaction against the wealth and grandiose nature of the ornate     monasteries of Anurādhapura.122 Decorated urinal slabs, meditational pathways   and the architectural style suggest that the Padhānaghara Pirivena represented a     contestatory discourse from the other monastic categories of Anurādhapura.123  Third, the Pabbata vihāra is a monastic form thought to date from between    700 to 1200 ce.124 Believed to be a royal foundation, its architecture shows evi-  dence of a preplanned scheme with a core monument zone of stūpa, image house,   Bōdhi tree shrine and chapter house surrounded by individual residential struc-   tures within a major moated enclosure.125 They have also been tentatively iden-  tified as having Mahāyāna affinities due to their resemblance to prescriptions     outlined in the Mahāyāna architectural treatise Mañjuśrī Vastuvidyāśāstra.126   This Mahāyāna influence has been illustrated at these sites through the recov-  ery of copper plaques and plates inscribed with text from the Pabbata Vihāra     of Vijayārāma,127 as well as from stūpas at Mihintale and Jetavana Vihāra. This   suggests evidence of the Mahāyāna practice of Dharma- dhātu, or venerating     the word of the Buddha,128 at monasteries with Mahāyāna leanings.129 Bronze   figures depicting Mahāyāna deities have also been excavated in pabbata vihāras  32   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="15"> 3   Fig. 1.2 Urinal stone at one of the Western Monasteries, Anurādhapura,  authors’ photograph.    within Anurādhapura.130 Mahāyāna traditions have also been recorded in textual   sources. For instance, the first recorded Bōdhisattva image is attributed to the  reign of King Mahasena (r. 275– 301 ce) and was produced on his request at the     Abhayagiri Vihāra.131 Other Mahāyāna practices, such as Dharma- dhātu men-   tioned above, are attributed in the chronicles to the sixth century ce,132 and a   group of Sanskrit inscriptions provides evidence of Mahāyāna traditions referenc-    ing concepts such as Trikaya.133  The cosmopolitan aspect of Buddhism is further demonstrated in the   Cūḷavaṃsa, in a passage narrating how the queen of Udaya I  (797–8 01 ce)     donated a monastery to a ‘Demaḷa bhikkhu community’.134 Although the meaning  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   33 </page> <page sequence="16"> 34    of the term ‘Demaḷa’ is contested,135 the fact that a distinction was drawn suggests  a group with possible differing practices. As well as being identified in textual  sources and in the architecture of monumental sites, such a pattern of architec- tural monastic variation was also apparent in the early medieval (600–1 200 ce)     hinterland of Anurādhapura.136 A pabbata vihāra site was identified at Parthigala  (Z001) in the vicinity of the Nachchaduwawewa, located 4.8 kilometres away   from a Padhānaghara Pirivena site at Marathamadama (C112). Although both  sites appear to have belonged to different Buddhist traditions, they also appear to  have been occupied contemporaneously. Furthermore, ‘orthodox’ monasteries of     the focal type were also widespread at the same time.137  At an individual level of analysis, scholars have also been able to identify  significant areas of differentiation within chronologically contemporary schools  of sculpture and image- making. In a study of six sculptures, based on lead isotope   and trace element scatter plots, Arjuna Thantilage identified two distinct groups  and interpreted them as representing two separate schools of image production   within the Anurādhapura period, possibly representing different Mahāyāna fra-    ternities.138 There are also architectural differences in stūpa construction across  the island. While perhaps reflecting differences in patronage or access to dis-  tinct building materials, the brick and stone constructions of Anurādhapura    and Polonnaruva, particularly the examples of ‘Buddhist giganticism’,139 are   in stark contrast to the coral and limestone stūpas in the Jaffna peninsula, as    in the monastic complexes of Delft and Kantarodai140 (Figures  1.3 and 1.4).    Fig. 1.3 Stūpas at Delft, authors’ photograph. 34   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="17"> 35   Fig. 1.4 Stūpas at Kantarodai, authors’ photograph. That such diversity existed elsewhere within the island is illustrated by the pres-  ence of the free- standing crystalline limestone Avalokiteśvara statues, ten metres  tall and dating to the seventh century ce, close to a free-s tanding 14.5- metre high  Buddha statue at Maligawila. Furthermore, at Buduruwagala a large rock carved  image of the Buddha, dating to the ninth–t enth century ce stands alongside pos-  sible depictions of Tara, Avalokiteśvara, Vajrapāṇi holding a thunderbolt, Maitreya   and either Viṣṇu or Sahāmpati Brahmā (Figure  1.5). Again, their co- existence  demonstrates the variability and diversity of Buddhism and religious practice, as     reflected though worship, patronage and architecture, within Sri Lanka.141 The population of Rajarata was also anything but homogenous in terms of  rank. Early Brahmi inscriptions dating to between the third century bce and first  century ce document a broad spectrum of patrons of early Buddhism, highlight-   ing the diverse society at this period.142 In an analysis of the 458 inscriptions dat- ing to the early historic period (340–2 00 bce) within a fifty-k ilometre radius of   Anurādhapura, donations mentioning monarchs only accounted for 20.22 per  cent of the corpus. Parumakas, identified as representing local chiefs, were the  most prevalent at 25.22 per cent, while those where no definitive rank could be  assigned accounted for 24.35 per cent. The role of those thought to represent  monks was also important in the early patronage of Buddhism, providing 18.91  per cent of donations; with other ranks such as Gamikas (6.09 per cent), Gapatis  (3.70 per cent) and Brahmans (1.52 per cent) contributing, as well as those    where the donor was unknown (5 per cent).143 When analysed island-w ide, the  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   35 </page> <page sequence="18"> 36   Fig. 1.5 Rock carved images at Buduruwagala, Monaragala District, authors’  photograph.   prevalence of donations by monarchs drops to only 6.4 per cent.144 While the high   frequency of donations by monarchs around Anurādhapura could be anticipated,   the overall picture is in stark contrast to the Mahāvaṃsa’s narrative, whereby  rather than an expected elite- driven process of conversion, under the patronage   of Devānaṃpiyatissa, leading to the majority of donations being royal in origin,  a broader swathe of segments of society contributed to the establishment and  growth of Buddhism.  The disparity between the donations mentioned in the chronicles and those   in the epigraphic record may be due to the rise of the Mahāvihāra and its cap- acity to shape memory. It has been suggested that the chronicles ‘may represent  a contrived ecclesiastical tradition legitimizing the contemporaneous status quo   by awarding a central position to the successful kings of Anurādhapura and ignor-   ing the contributions of the failed kings’,145 as well as other segments of society.  Indeed, it has previously been noted that in the Early Brahmi epigraphic corpus of     Sri Lanka, only ten kings mentioned in the chronicles have been found.146 Senarat  Paranavitana reported failing to identify a single inscription relating to a donation     by Devānaṃpiyatissa.147 Moreover, the corpus of inscriptions reveals genealogies  of previously unknown royal lineages, and lineages that have been either ignored     by or edited out from the Mahāvaṃsa’s narrative.148  While the epigraphic corpus illustrates that many different communities  and segments of society were patrons of Buddhism, there is also evidence that  the Sangha was not the sole recipient. Indeed, pre-B uddhist beliefs are attested  to in the chronicles in connection with the presence of Yakkhas. Yakkhas are    also recorded in the Vijayan narrative149 and in the narrative of the laying- out  36   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="19"> 37    of Anurādhapura by King Paṇḍukābhaya in the fourth century bce.150 In this  description, additional religious groups, such as ‘ascetics’, ‘heretical sects’ and    ‘Brahmans’ were alluded to but were located outside the city.151 Many of these   orders are recorded as having received state patronage, with Paṇḍukābhaya  building ‘a monastery for wandering mendicant monks, and a dwelling for the     Ājīvakas, and a residence for the Brahmans’.152 Brahmans were recorded as under- taking important religious roles prior to the arrival of Buddhism, and it is noted   that during the reign of one of Sri Lanka’s first monarchs, King Paṇḍuvāsudeva,    the wisdom of ‘Brahmans skilled in sacred texts’153 was called upon for important  matters. This importance continued after the arrival and adoption of Buddhism  in Sri Lanka, as shown by the twenty- two Early Brahmi inscriptions that mention  Brahmans. While there is a possibility that the title ‘Brahman’ may have continued  to be applied after changes in religious affiliation, there is also a possibility that     Brahmanism continued alongside early Buddhism in early historic Sri Lanka.154  This suggests that the historical developments of the later Anurādhapura  period and the shift of the capital to Polonnaruva, traditionally associated with the   emergence of a polyvocality of religions and an increased South Indian influence,   was not completely novel. In the chronicles, there are records of Anurādhapura’s  kings supporting non- Buddhist institutions, although for other reigns the only  recorded events are the destruction of such institutions, such as Mahasena’s    demolition of the temples of Brahmanical gods.155 Later, the chronicles recorded  that Mahinda II (r. 777– 797 ce) ‘restored many decayed temples of the gods here    and there and had costly images of the gods fashioned’.156 Sena II (r. 853– 887     ce) was recorded as supporting Brahman rituals.157 Conversely, Pathmanathan  has also drawn attention to the Tamil inscription recording the establishment of a   Buddhist monastery in the new Cōḻa capital by a South Indian mercantile group,     the Aiññūṟṟuvar.158 As stated above, the transfer of the capital to Polonnaruva has  been portrayed as connected with a religious shift towards a more pluralistic and  eclectic patronage at state- level, incorporating Buddhist, Brahmanical and Saivite     practices.159 Indrapala has suggested that in tandem with the widespread appear-  ance of tenth-c entury Tamil inscriptions dated to the regal years of Cōḻa rulers,     there was also an increase in Saiva temples.160 In the chronicles, it is also stated   that Parākramabāhu I  (r. 1153– 86 ce) constructed twenty- four temples to the   gods, and Pathmanathan has recorded the presence of at least fourteen temples     within Polonnaruva.161 In support of this plurality, archaeological investigations  at Polonnaruva have identified Saiva and Vaisnava shrines with bronze Nataraja,     Śiva and Parvati images.162 A  twelfth-c entury inscription of Niśśaṅkamalla  (r. 1187– 96 ce) at Dambulla recorded the construction of a Hindu temple as well     as the restoration and construction of Buddhist temples.163 In Anurādhapura itself,  structures north of Abhayagiri dating to the later phases of the city’s occupation  were identified as ‘Hindu ruins’ on the basis of their architectural layout and the    recovery of several lingams,164 although this identification has been contested.165  Artefactual evidence from Anurādhapura’s hinterland also illustrates addi-  tional ‘non- Buddhist’ religious and ritual practices about which the Mahāvaṃsa’s  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   37 </page> <page sequence="20"> 38   Fig. 1.6 Terracotta figurine fragments from the site of Nikawewa (D339),  including a depiction of a human face (right) and an anthropomorphic phallus  (left), authors’ photograph.  narrative appears silent. From a hinterland survey around Anurādhapura, a total  of 489 terracotta artefacts from eight sites, the majority excavated at Nikawewa    (D339), were recorded.166 Dating to between 900 and 1300 ce,167 these arte- facts include human and animal figurines as well as anthropomorphic phalli  (Figure 1.6). They were deliberately broken and may reflect a practice not far    from that described in studies of the Gammaduva ceremony.168 Deposited in  caches across the Dry Zone and known from more than twenty sites, they dis- play a distinct uniformity of design and were clearly restricted to non- monastic  and non- urban sites. Traditionally categorized as ‘folk’ art, they have neverthe- less been found associated with a monumental structure at Nikawewa. We have  thus reinterpreted them as representing a powerful shared and formalized corpus    of ritual practice parallel to Buddhism.169 This example highlights the ability of  archaeology to recognize groups operating outside official state or elite circles. It   further suggests that early medieval Anurādhapura was capable of incorporating     multiple religious and ritual networks.170  Urbanism  Nestled within the diverse monastic landscape of Anurādhapura was the citadel,  measuring one kilometre square, and defined by a ditch and rampart. This has    been subject to more than a century of excavations.171 Early historic treatises,   such as the Arthaśāstra, contain details of how urban forms should be planned;    quadrangular, surrounded by three moats and a rampart,172 and internally    structured by cardinally orientated roads and gateways.173 Within the city, the   Arthaśāstra advises that the inhabitants should be separated along varna and  38   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="21"> 39  occupational lines, with heretics and caṇḍālas (outcastes) banished outside the    city walls.174 Furthermore, as outlined in the previous section, the description in   the Mahāvaṃsa of the laying-o ut of Anurādhapura in the fourth century bce by   Paṇḍukābhaya records that the city was divided into four quarters, and that sep-   arate areas of the city were allocated for different social groups.175 Such textual    descriptions have been linked to the archaeological evidence176 and, architectur-  ally, Anurādhapura appears to match these descriptions as its moat, rampart and   cardinally orientated structures seem to conform to the Arthaśāstra’s precepts and   the description of Paṇḍukābhaya’s city. It has been argued that Anurādhapura’s  layout ‘was no casual cluster of buildings but a cosmography that reflected the     universe’.177 This follows the argument of Hocart, who suggested that during the  early historic period ‘the doctrine of the four quarters [...] had a considerable     influence on the planning of cities’.178 As stated above, other Sri Lankan urban  forms correspond to cosmological symbolism, with their plans recreating the uni-   verse in microcosm.179  However, much evidence from Anurādhapura now suggests that such plans  were idealizations. Working on the premise that distinct social groups may be   identifiable through artefactual variability across a site, Coningham and Young    analysed craft waste and faunal remains from different areas across the citadel.180   They found no distinct areas associated with specific crafts. The faunal record  is particularly interesting in that species forbidden and permitted by the laws    of Manu were found together throughout the city.181 Following suggestions by    anthropologists and historians that caste rigidity may be a recent phenomenon,182  this analysis reinforces the notion that social divisions based on material differ-  entiation were not present in early historic Anurādhapura – or may require more  refined archaeological methodologies than those at our disposal in order to be     identified.183 This is not to say that Anurādhapura did not host various differenti- ated communities, as outlined above. It rather suggests that while there is abun- dant evidence for plurality, there were also widely shared practices. Cosmopolitan  practices were compatible with both differentiation and unifying concepts and   lifestyle choices.  Studying the cosmopolitan through archaeology   in Sri Lanka  It is clear that Sri Lanka was not a uniquely Buddhist island but had strong Hindu  influences as well as more localized traditions, as evidenced by the emergent ter-  racotta cults in the hinterland of Anurādhapura. Rather than focusing on the reli-  gious and spiritual aspects of Buddhism, archaeological evidence suggests that   the monastic institutions of Anurādhapura seemed to have played a dominant  material role in the colonization, management and development of the wider  landscape surrounding the city. Monasteries remained the only viable long-t erm  structures within the hinterland, as attempts to secularize the management of the  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   39 </page> <page sequence="22"> 40 landscape faded. The epigraphic record reveals how land was donated by kings  and other elites to these monasteries, to the degree of completely alienating it   from state control. Sri Lankan scholars have long hypothesized about this, with  Leslie Gunawardana stating in 1979 that ‘considerable powers were transferred to  the monastic administration by withholding the authority of government officials     to intervene in their affairs’,184 Even more starkly, Dias wrote that ‘lands and vil- lages beyond the control of the central authority were given to the monasteries to  bring some control over them [...] This way the monastic institutions became the     landed intermediary between the central political authority and the people.’185 The recent research-o riented fieldwork developed in the hinterland of   Anurādhapura has demonstrated the existence of a complex patchwork, itself con- sisting of intricate networks of religious and secular cooperation and communica- tion. As noted above, six years of field research have allowed us to identify more  than 750 archaeological sites, ranging from small scatters of eroded ceramics,  through rock-c ut caves, stone bridges over the Malvatu Oya, metal- working sites  and a corpus of sites containing terracotta figurines, to monastic complexes several    hectares in size.186 The ceramic scatters can be interpreted as short-t erm villages  linked to slash-a nd- burn (chena) agriculture. Monastic sites, in contrast, ranging  from rock- cut shelters to large complexes, reflect a much more permanent and  highly visible presence. This contrast led us initially to theorize about a ‘Theocratic  Landscape’ in which monasteries functioned as centres of economic and polit-   ical control (in lieu of towns), while villages kept shifting around them.187 Since  then, we have developed a more complex model of ‘Buddhist Temporalities’ and  low- density urbanism, reflecting our growing awareness of multiple heterarchies   in the Anurādhapura hinterland. Our Buddhist Temporality model reflects the  complex relationship between monastic institutions and secular authority,  contending that ‘the city’s surrounding landscape of villages and rural communi- ties was not centrally regulated by the state through higher-o rder settlements and   royal officials but through a network of Vihāras, closely linked to the great monas-    teries of the city rather than the throne’.188  Certainly, the critical reappraisal of archaeological evidence allows us to   narrow the gap between Anurādhapura and Polonnaruva. While the latter has  long been archaeologically interpreted as a cosmopolitan urban centre, similar   evidence from Anurādhapura has been largely undervalued but is now over- whelming. The remains of Polonnaruva, traditionally dated to between 1017 and  1293 ce, have revealed Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples with bronze  sculptures of Hindu deities. This has led some scholars, rightly in our opinion,    to speak of religious plurality and harmony.189 Excavations within the Alahana   Pirivena in Polonnaruva uncovered quantities of pottery with appliqué designs,     including swastika, śrīvasta and vajra or triśūla,190 which have now also been  identified in the city’s hinterland (Figure 1.7). Bronze figurines excavated at  Polonnaruva and representing deities such as Śiva and Parvati have been put    forward as evidence of the presence of Hinduism in the city.191 And yet such evi- dence was not restricted to Polonnaruva. For example, figures of Śiva, Parvati,  40   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="23"> 41    Fig. 1.7 Appliqué triśūla on a pottery rim sherd from site Kalahagala (S360)  in the hinterland of Polonnaruva, found during the 2016 field season of the  Polonnaruva Archaeological and Anthropological Research Project, authors’  photograph.  Kevalamūrti and Nṛtyamūrti, and potentially Ardhanarīśvara, were recovered    from a pillar foundation at Jetavana in the 1980s.192 Furthermore, three appli-  qué ceramic sherds with symbols similar to those from the Alahana Pirivena were     discovered in the later sequence of trench ASW2 at Anurādhapura,193 as well as     in the vicinity of Jetavana.194 The later evidence at Anurādhapura is striking in  its similarity to the evidence usually given for plurality of belief in Polonnaruva,   and yet Anurādhapura, persistently presented as an essentially Buddhist capital,  is generally not advanced as a similar example of religious plurality. The transmis-  sion of the capital from Anurādhapura to Polonnaruva has been projected as an  abrupt and singular event, yet recent research has shown the abandonment of   Anurādhapura and its hinterland to have been a slow process that happened over    several centuries.195 We would argue that around Polonnaruva there is likely to  be evidence of much earlier settlements and communities that would shed more  light on the nature of early medieval Sri Lanka. To this end, the Central Cultural  Fund and British Academy have sponsored successful pilot hinterland surveys   around Polonnaruva, as well as excavations at Śiva Devale No.2 and the citadel’s   northern wall.  We are, of course, far from constructing a clear narrative and it remains  problematic to assign certain artefactual forms to particular groups. Widely  shared symbols, such as the swastika and vajra / triśūla, highlight the difficulties  inherent to South Asian archaeology. Indeed, they lead to questions about the  ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   41 </page> <page sequence="24"> 42   Fig. 1.8 Head from a Buddha image rededicated as an image of Ayanayake,   Anurādhapura hinterland, authors’ photograph. extent to which artefacts can be defined as Buddhist, Hindu or Jain. The fluid  identity of artefacts has recently been noted at a modern shrine to Ayanayake,   lord of the jungle, in the Anurādhapura hinterland. The shrine was constructed  using reclaimed pillars from nearby monastic structures damaged during road  construction but was also equipped with an eroded Buddha head, which was    painted with the trunk of Ayanayake, as the focus of the shrine196 (Figure 1.8).  While objects may be used in more than one context with changed meanings, the  opposite may also occur, with similar architectural motifs being part of several   traditions. Stūpas and vihāras share many traits with Jain and Hindu architec-    ture.197 A further challenge that needs addressing is the archaeological visibility   of women within early Sri Lanka’s history and archaeology. Indeed, Faxian noted     the presence of nuns within the Sacred City of Anurādhapura198 and inscriptions    record donations by female devotees throughout Sri Lanka.199 Furthermore,  communities of Buddhist nuns from Sri Lanka are recorded in an inscription    at Nagarjunakonda in India200 but, in spite of this, there has been little discus- sion of this challenge within both archaeological interpretations and Buddhist    discourse.201 Gender is notoriously difficult to identify within the archaeologi- cal record, especially when dealing with the ephemeral remains of a subtropical  landscape. However, if we want to truly understand the cosmopolitan nature of  early historic and early medieval Sri Lanka, such challenges have to be acknowl-  edged and then addressed. 42   Sri  lAnkA At tHE croSSroAdS of HiStorY </page> <page sequence="25"> 43 The landscape we have been studying was highly contested, closely inte- grated into the secular and monastic core, yet at the same time divorced from the  networks and linkages enjoyed by the urban elite. Tensions prevailed between  the pressing need to participate in larger networks of exchange, patronage and  religious merit through the royal centre and major monastic institutions of   Anurādhapura, on the one hand, and the practice of non- Buddhist rituals, on the  other. Such diversity continued into the late medieval period, as attested by the  fifteenth- century trilingual inscription of Admiral Zheng He in Galle. The inscrip- tion in Tamil, Chinese and Persian records the veneration of an incarnation of   Viṣṇu, of the Buddha, and of a Muslim saint, providing evidence for the continued,    diverse and dynamic linguistic and religious framework of the island.202 Taking all  this together, we find evidence of what can be interpreted as a highly cosmopoli- tan society with broad international links and outlooks and considerable internal  diversity. This society participated in an ever-e xpanding network of religious and  economic exchange and patronage. Yet, at the same time, there were also dis- tinctly pervasive traditions – subsistence, ceramic forms, craft manufacturing and  patterns of low density urbanism. This apparently contradictory stance reflects  the many possible facets of community identity, ranging in scale from the local  to the regional and the global. The degree to which different communities had  access to opportunities probably changed over time but the archaeological record  overall strongly suggests that Sri Lanka, far from being a peripheral island, was at  the very heart of many social, economic and religious developments of the Indian     Ocean World.203 ArcHAEologY And coSmopolitAniSm   43 </page> </plain_text>
