<plain_text><page sequence="1">V HO'S TALKING? HOW CHARAC- TERS BECOME NARRATORS IN FICTION q DONALD ROSS, JR. q Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, "I think you ought to tell me who you are, first." "Why?" said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question; and, as Alice could not think of any good reason, and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleas- ant state of mind, she turned away. For these moments, and for a pleasant time before and after, we read the account of Alice's dream. We know about her irritation and her sense that the Caterpillar should have said more than he did; then we follow her puzzlement and we can see why she turns away. All this is a precise rendering of what and why she does and thinks, yet it is not explained in a way that most people use to tell of their motives, their feelings, or their dreams. When I dream of caterpillars smoking dope, my account starts with a "logical" pronoun-"I." Somehow in narratives it is possible to convey any amount of intimate details concerning the thoughts, visions, and dreams of characters without having them troop up to a confes- sional or write letters to close friends. In this essay, I will explore the way readers find out who is talking to them in those stories which do not have a first-person narrator. The focus will be on stories which have no identifiable narrator and no author's voice, especially those where the immediate contact between reader and tale has been exploited to show the psychological interiors of characters. I will first examine the general conventions for quoting peoples' words; then show that the same conventions are used to dramatize thoughts. The narrative mode I want to explore in detail depends on our knowledge of traditional quoting conventions. Story telling in its barest sense relates a series of actions of one or more characters. Actions include spoken words, so stories can be split into dialogue MLN 91 (1976) 1208-1221 Copyright ? 1976 by The Johns Hopkins University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.</page><page sequence="2">M L N 1223 and the equivalent of stage directions (an account of physical movement).1 A bare narrative can be enhanced by a description of a setting. A story can have explicit comments from a story-teller who frames the events ("Let me tell you the one about ... "). The teller can explain why the characters act as they do, but such com- ments radically separate the narrative from the stage drama. Comments can range widely, from those about physical limits (be- cause he was tall, he could see over the fence), to social and economic factors (because the king was rich, he could buy the queen), to personal or psychological motives (because she was crazy, she axed her uncle). Fiction during the past century has increased the extent to which narrators conjecture about the other characters, testify about their own emotions and motives, or betray other information about their psyches. These changes complicate two rhetorical aspects of story-telling-the relation between the narrator and the reader, and that between the narrator and the world he tells about. We need to know who is telling the tale in order to characterize this complexity. A narrator is a speaking voice, so narration is, in a sense, related to monologue. When characters talk in novels, they are usually quoted directly: " 'I am the first comer,' Zenobia went on to say,"2 or indirectly: "I gave them to understand that it was, at most, only an experiment ..." Indirect quotation implies that the character's actual words could be found if quotation marks were put in and some routine changes made in pronouns and verb tenses, as in He said that he did -&gt; He said, "I do." A third way to transmit dialogue is by paraphrase, where at least a hint of the actual words shows through: "Hollingsworth held it at his choice (and he did so choose) to obtain possession of the very ground ... " where the adverbs so and very and the double emphasis on choosing convey Hol- lingsworth's passion. Paraphrase is often motivated by a narrator who claims to reduce the length or complexity of a passage: "There can be no need of giving in detail the conversation that ensued." A final way to convey what was said is "represented discourse,"3 1 The separation has been recognized since classical times. A particularly useful recent discussion, including a survey of others' work, may be found in Lubomir Doleiel's Narrative Modes in Czech Literature (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1974). 2 Citations in this paragraph and the next come from Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance. Throughout the paper, I have supplied all the italics. 3 Doleiel. esD. Ch. 1.</page><page sequence="3">1224 DONALD ROSS, JR. where the narrator clearly and significantly intervenes: "I told him my piteous case" or "He spoke of a new era that was dawning upon the world." We cannot retrieve the actual words. The main job of represented discourse is to transmit or betray information about the narrator's attitude toward what he represents. The line be- tween paraphrase and represented discourse is fuzzy, but for our purposes it is enough to know that both are forms of quoting. Conventions developed during the nineteenth century demand that a clear line be kept between discourses of the narrator and those of the characters. One result of this division is that a realistic tale can individualize characters by their dialects (as in Huck Finn) or by speaking idiosyncracies (as in Bounderby's many references to "turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon"). Another conven- tion that has developed is that narrators are presumed to transcribe direct quotations accurately, no matter how unreliable or deceiving they are in unquoted passages. We expect to be told if the apparent quotation has been changed. Hawthorne's Coverdale says, "I know not whether the following version of her story will retain any por- tion of its pristine character." If a narrator must imagine a conver- sation he cannot hear, we expect to be told: " . . . I hardly could make out an intelligible sentence on either side. What I seem to remember, I yet suspect, may have been patched together, by my fancy." All this is fine-just about what a newspaper editor would tell a reporter, so that both could avoid law suits. But other strange things are set between inverted commas: His final glance said half cynically, half in pity: "You are naive and unspoilt now, but these eyes will see yours harden like the rest. Wretched victim of gold, you are only in a procession, after all." (Bennett, Anna of the Five Towns, Ch. 3) Not only talking glances, but also you and me: "Why were you so glad to be friends with M. Paul?" asks the reader. "Had he not long been a friend to you ... ?" Yes, he had ... (C. Bronte, Villette, Ch. 36) The most prevalent use of quoting conventions for material other than spoken words is for characters' thoughts and emotions. We can thus have direct thought: " 'This will not hold long,' I thought to myself."4 The more usual vehicle is indirect thought: "I felt sure now 4 Citations in this part of the essay come from Charlotte Bronte's Villette.</page><page sequence="4">M L N 1225 that I was in the pensionnat-sure by the beating rain on the case- ment; sure by the 'wuther' of wind among the trees." We expect that represented thought or testimony will reveal the narrator's per- sonality: "I felt alarmed" or "I thought of Graham and his spectral illusions." When the narrator conjectures about others' thoughts, the distinction between paraphrased and represented thought may still hold. The sentence "I knew that action would give a turn to his mood" may be a paraphrase since it is accurate-action does turn M. Paul's mood. Represented thought is shown in "I think he had purposed on that day to indicate the origin of his endeavours, and the aim of his ambition." Some verbs explicitly suggest thoughts, such as opine, believe, recall, while others suggest emotions, such as feel, wish, fear. In practice, verbs of thought and feeling are interchangeable-one can think he loves, orfear that the sun is hot. Whether we label a sentence emotional or rational depends on the context in which it is uttered, not on the explicit verbs which are used.5 Other verbs which convey thought depend on the analogy between physical sensations and mental acts: see, sense, hear. Henry James is particularly fond of building on this analogy, since it im- plies that physical seeing is like understanding and vice versa: "... he saw, in the truth, in the cruelty of his image, what had been appointed and done" ("Beast in the Jungle").6 The verb seem is a special and important case since it implies mental activity, but it is usually used without an explicit agent: "Some new power it seemed [to me] to bring." The verbal and mental activities of characters are presented in formally similar ways. An attributing clause, which tells who talks or thinks, labels the activity in the predicate,7 and optionally tells how the activity is delivered: "said Paulina, looking up" and "whisper- ing, however, with gravity."8 It would be convenient to subsume 5The option of using "explicit performatives" is present in most speech acts-we could label all questions, commands, assertions, polite requests-but the usual situa- tion is to make the locutionary act and let the illocutionary act be interpreted from contexts. 6 An account of when sensing verbs are used literally and when they are metaphors for mental activity would prove a fruitful ground to measure stylistic differences among novelists. For example, I could find no metaphoric usage in Villette. 7 Richard Ohmann in "Generative Grammars and the Concept of Literary Style," Word, 20 (1964), 423-39, calls these "matrix sentences"; others have called them embedding or framing clauses. 8 Another group of stylistic variations could be traced among novelists. For exam-</page><page sequence="5">1226 DONALD ROSS, JR. these activities under a single heading such as "discourse," but no term exists. The problem of attributing the unquoted mental activity and sensing verbs is more complicated in third-person stories and novels. In first-person narratives all unquoted words must be attri- buted to the dramatized narrator, and it does not matter if she be the central character (in Villette), or somewhat peripheral (in Blithedale Romance), or far from the story's center (Turgeniev's sportsman comes to mind). A first-person narrative does not allow for a story-telling author unless it happens in a larger frame-the "editor" of an epistolary novel, or the "John Ray, Jr., PhD." who introduces Lolita. First-person narratives are usually subjective, to use the taxonomy developed by Dolezel;9 that is, the narrator both participates in the drama and comments about other characters. Less frequent modes are the rhetorical, where the narrator com- ments but does not participate, and the observer's, where he does neither, but is just physically present at the events. A narrator not depicted as being at an event, must gather accounts of others by letters, stolen diaries or interviews. Shifting from one narrative source to another is a trifle cumbersome as illustrated by Isabella's letter in Wuthering Heights, buried in Lockwood's quotation of Nel- lie Dean's report. An even more involuted array of sources exists in novels such as Absolom! Absolom! where telling is itself a major theme of the book.'0 Third-person narratives are traditionally divided by English and American critics and handbooks between those by an "omniscient" narrator, and those from a "limited point of view." I find both terms inaccurate."1 All narration must have a limited physical van- tage place, a "camera angle"-even Woolfs The Waves with its six simultaneous narratives does one at a time. The feature which prompts the claim of omniscience is that the narrative shifts among several characters and gives information about their thoughts and pie, Hawthorne's speeches are often given an adverb about the manner of delivery, while Bronte's have some gesture while they talk. 9 Dolezel, pp. 6-13. 10 An especially involuted case is the diary in the middle of A. Bronte's Tenant oJ Wildfell Hall, which goes from Chapter 16 to 49 (about 300 pages), and was fiction- ally copied out in one night. The diary is part of a letter which starts in Chapter 2 and goes to the end of the book, a candidate for the world record. 1 Wayne Booth is also troubled by the traditional terms; see The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1967), p. 265.</page><page sequence="6">M L N 1227 emotions. "Limited point of view" seems usually to refer to narra- tives, especially of the late nineteenth century, where the world is depicted as it is sensed by a character who is also an actor within the story. These terms make or imply important differences among stories-but their anthropomorphic connotations are misleading. Some third-person narratives are presented by a viewer who is both external to the events, and isolated from the thoughts of the charac- ters; this mode approximates the situation of a stage drama with only dialogue, stage directions, and settings. Most third-person narratives, however, may be attributed to a single character who appears in the story, and most give a view into the mind of the character to whom they are attributed.12 Sentences in first-person narratives are attributed automatically-as soon as we read "Call me Ishmael," each subsequent utterance presupposes the clause "I say that . . ". A similar convention lets many sentences be quoted directly without the need to supply new attributing clauses for each. The scope of quoting in first-person and direct quotation is clearly defined. The surest way to show the source of indirect or represented mental and verbal activity is to repeat attributing clauses, as in this passage from Lawrence's short story "The Princess": She knew he was helping her. And she felt in his presence a subtle, insidious male kindliness she had never known before waiting upon her.'3 A whole paragraph or more can be presented where attribution is inferred from a broader context. We know from very few passages that Marlow tells Lord Jim's story; Ishmael's name is mentioned about three times in Moby-Dick. Lawrence's "The Woman Who Rode Away" begins with "She had thought that ... ". In the third sentence we read three clauses and over sixty words before coming to "it was obvious [to her] that," which is the final attributing clause 12 Franz Stanzel in Narrative Situations in the Novel: Tom Jones, Moby-Dick, The Am- bassadors, Ulysses, trans., James P. Pusack (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1971) describes the "figural novel" where "the reader has the illusion of being present on the scene in one of the figures" (p. 23). Stanzel does not distinguish between what I call "external" and "attributed" narratives (cf. p. 92), nor does he detail how we identify the "figure." Stanzel's study is quite comprehensive, as his title suggests, so I do not intend to fault his omissions. 13 The examples from Lawrence are in The Complete Short Stories (New York: Viking, 1962). Pages in the three volumes are numbered consecutively.</page><page sequence="7">1228 DONALD ROSS, JR. of the paragraph. Having established the environment, the second paragraph needs but one reminder at the beginning: "When she actually saw what ... ". Then nothing in the third paragraph, one "she saw" in the fourth, and so on. Not all attributed narration explores psychological depths. This passage from "The Shadow in the Rose Garden" only defines a camera angle, with the sensing verb taken literally:14 He went downstairs. She sat still on the bed ... the time went by, she could smell the dinner being served, the smoke of her husband's pipe from the garden. The physical setting allows easy introduction of the wife's thoughts. The next sentence, "But she could not move," is a transition to her testimony: "She had no being." We recognize that first-person con- fessions about emotional states are privileged and unimpeachable- if I say "I feel nervous," no one, not my spouse, my neurologist, or my analyst can refute the assertion, and I am not obliged to give evi- dence for its validity. The wife's sense that she does not exist is exactly such a privileged assertion. An earlier paragraph from the same story is worth quoting in full, since it shows nicely how a skeletal frame of attributing words and clauses (in italics) has a scope which includes the other sen- tences. If the argument about quoting environments is valid, then the wife is the person whose imagination creates the rich and threatening landscape: She went forward, forgetting the gardener in a moment. Her face became strained, her movements eager. Glancing around, she saw all the windows giving on to the lawn were curtainless and dark. The house had a sterile appearance [to her], as if it were still used, but not inhabited. A shadow seemed to go over her. She went across the lawn towards the garden, through an arch of crimson ramblers, a gate of colour. There beyond lay the soft blue sea within the bay, misty with morning, and the farthest headland of black rock jutting dimly out between blue and blue of the sky and water. Her face began to shine, transfigured with pain and joy. At her feet the garden fell steeply, all a confusion of flowers, and away below was the darkness of tree-tops covering the beck. 14 The English pronoun system also gives clues for proper attribution. The cited passage could not logically state: He went downstairs. (His wife) sat still on the bed. . . (His wife) could smell the smoke of (his) pipe from the garden.</page><page sequence="8">M L N 1229 These images, the Edenic "gate," the confusion, are not necessarily available to the character's conscious mind. Lawrence does not suggest that she could say in words that these things are her thoughts; in fact the wife's spoken words are utilitarian and not at all lyrical. In her sparse dialogue, her most expressive words are "strange," "fond," and the cumbersome "not-straightforward." Lawrence uses attributed narration to depict a rich mental life for a virtually inarticulate character. Accepting that hypothesis explains the middle sentence of the following: Then she wondered over the white rose, that was greenish, like ice, in the centre. So, slowly, like a white, pathetic butterfly, she drifted down the path, coming at last to a tiny terrace all full of roses. They seemed [to her] to fill the place, a sunny, gay throng. The comparisons between the white rose and ice, the free associa- tion from the flower and the butterfly are the wife's images of herself. The expressive words "sunny" and "gay," and the sense of surprise conveyed by "at last" are hers, and are not to be ascribed to a narrator exernal to the tale.15 Another way to attribute narration is to have speech-like utter- ances in the unquoted parts of a story, as in this rhetorical question (also from "Rose Garden"): "For a moment she was silent with surprise. How should it be public at all?" Or this exclamation, three paragraphs later: "She stood still, reflecting. How strange to think of the rector opening his garden to the public!" Another story by Lawrence, "England, My England" has the full array of speech-like elements in attributed narration-interjections and sentences that break off uncompleted: "Joyce was once more on her feet; but, alas! lame, with iron supports to her leg, and a little crutch." These fragments, interjections and questions are followed by a clear at- tributing sentence: And yet, war! War! Just war! Not right or wrong, but just war itself. Should he join? Should he give himself over to war? The question was in his mind for some weeks. When attributed narration is fully dramatized, when it is all direct 15 An alternative reading of these three sentences posits an author's or narrator's voice which supplies the butterfly simile, and presumably has great authority. I prefer to keep the sentences together in a single fictional mode, especially since nothing signals a change in attribution.</page><page sequence="9">1230 DONALD ROSS, JR. or indirect thought, a passage is properly labeled "free indirect style," which is the English version of the French term style indirect libre. In English the term "free" seems to denote free of the need to keep saying who says it, while the French phrase has a more precise definition based on verb tenses. Free indirect style, in my terminol- ogy, is a special case of attributed narration, one characterized by highly dramatic syntax.16 The source of narrative information can be found from attribut- ing clauses and words. One way to dramatize and analyze the effect of knowing the source is by making a passage explicit in first- person. Examples from the first chapter of James's "The Spoils of Poynton" will illustrate the general process. The first two sentences of the story are quoted to the left; attributing words are em- phasized. The parallel column differs only by having pronouns and Mrs. Gereth's name changed.17 Mrs. Gereth had said she would go with the rest to church, but suddenly it seemed to her that she should not be able to wait even till church-time for relief: breakfast, at Waterbath, was a punctual meal, and she had still nearly an hour on her hands. Knowing the church to be near, she prepared in her room for the little rural walk, and on her way down again, passing through corridors and observing im- becilities of decoration, the aesthetic misery of the big, commodious house, she felt a return of the tide of last night's irritation, a renewal of every- thing she could secretly suffer from ugliness and stupidity. I had said I would go with the rest to church, but suddenly it seemed to me that I should not be able to wait even till church-time for relief; breakfast, at Waterbath, was a punctual meal, and I had still nearly an hour on my hands. Knowing the church to be near, I prepared in my room for the little rural walk, and on my way down again, passing through corridors and observing imbecilities of decoration, the aesthetic misery of the big, com- modious house, I felt a return of the tide of last night's irritation, a renewal of everything I could secretly suffer from ugliness and stupidity. Little, if anything, has happened to either the syntax or paraphras- able semantic content of the passage, and it would be a credible way to begin a story on its own. The only information obviously lost is 16 While no consensus exists on the features of style indirect libre, a reasonably complete list is given by W. J. W. Bronzwaer, Tense in the Novel: An Investigation of Some Potentialities of Linguistic Criticism (Groningen: Walters-Noordhoff, 1970), pp. 49, 72 et passim. He cites emotive exclamations ("gosh"), demonstrative pronouns, colloquialisms, strings of related words or synonyms (such as an appositive), prolep-</page><page sequence="10">M L N 1231 Mrs. Gereth's name, but that could easily have been given in an early dialogue, had James written the story in first person. Had he done so, of course, Mrs. Gereth's talking presence would have been overwhelming. A later passage from the same chapter is slightly harder to attribute since two characters are present: Invited by her companion, who had asked if it weren't wonderful, Mrs. Gereth had begun to say a word about Poynton; but she heard a sound of voices that made her stop short. The next moment she rose to her feet, and Fleda could see that her alarm was by no means quenched. Invited by my (G) companion, who had asked if it weren't wonderful, I had begun to say a word about Poyn- ton; but I (we) heard a sound of voi- ces that made me stop short. The next moment she rose to her feet, and I (F) could see that her alarm was by no means quenched. Mrs. Gereth's "companion" is Fleda Vetch, but the first "her" refers to Mrs. Gereth; both women hear the voices, but Mrs. Gereth stops short. What happens then is that the physical camera angle shifts to Fleda, where it stays for the rest of the chapter. James confirms this hypothesis with a sentence in story-teller's first person in the next paragraph; "That member of the party in whose intenser con- sciousness we shall most profitably seek a reflection of the little sis, rhetorical questions, and expressions denoting inner thoughts or feelings. Bronzwaer's account is based partially on Weinrich's Tempus and Ullman's Style in the French Novel. Pierre Guiraud in "Modern Linguistics Looks at Rhetoric: Free Indi- rect Style" in Joseph Strelka, ed. Patterns of Literary Style (University Park: Pennsyl- vania State Univ. Press, 1971) stresses that style indirect libre demands the presence of both a commenting, evaluating narrator, and the words or thoughts of the characters-these latter are expressed with colloquial and "speaking voice" features (p. 86). A controversy exists about the extent to which framing clauses are allowed, since the word libre means free of such clauses. For example, Bronzwaer cites a passage where ten out of twenty sentences have framing clauses. Incidentally, as Bronzwaer notes, calling this technique of representing character's thoughts a "style" is a misnomer; his preferred term is "interior reporting" (p. 87). Margaret Lips in Le Style Indirect Libre (Paris: Payot, 1926) notes that French grammar de- mands that indirectly quoted sentences be in imparfait, since they implicitly follow il dit que. Although Lips cites examples from Jane Austen (p. 208) where conditional auxiliaries may imply quotation, English obviously has no special tenses for quota- tions. The initial definition of style indirect libre came from Charles Bally's explana- tion of the presence of imparfait forms in contexts which might have had passe defini, the usual narrating verb tense (Lips, p. 21). 17 Bronzwaer, pp. 55-6, suggests that two transformations are involved when style indirect libre is compared with first-person narration: a pronoun adjustment and deletion of a clause "containing a speak, think, orfeel verb." It is both unlikely and tautological that every sentence in a narrative has I say that... in "deep structure."</page><page sequence="11">1232 DONALD ROSS, JR. drama with which we are concerned received an even livelier im- pression of Mrs. Gereth's intervention . . . ". The reader needs to recognize that the bulk of "Spoils of Poynton" is narrated through Fleda, who is enormously naive in matters of sex and Art, yet has to understand a world where sexual innuendo and High Taste are crucial. Wayne Booth claims that Fleda is "close to representing the author's ideal of taste, judgment, and moral sense," but that kind of biographical claim about James really needs to be weighed against the extent to which Fleda's awareness is changing and developing throughout the story.18 James's Ambassadors demands that the idiosyncracies of prose style be identified with Lambert Strether's involuted and complex way of thinking about and viewing the world, or else the novel is simply a disaster. Ian Watt's famous explication concludes that the first paragraph reveals the "dual presence of Strether's conscious- ness and that of the narrator who translates what he sees there into more general terms."19 Attributing the paragraph (and most of the novel) to Strether as a source greatly simplifies the explanation and removes the need to search for a ghostly narrator who is somehow external to the events and characters. Watt, after all, does not say what the "general terms" are, nor does he say what got translated to what.20 The paragraph and its first-person transformation are given in the double columns: Strether's first question, when he reached the hotel, was about his friend; yet on his learning that Waymarsh was apparently not to ar- rive till evening he was not wholly dis- concerted. A telegram from him bes- peaking a room "only if not noisy," reply paid, was produced for the en- quirer at the office, so that the under- standing they should meet at Chester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The same secret principle, however, that had prompted My first question, when I reached the hotel, was about my friend; yet on my learning that Waymarsh was appa- rently not to arrive till evening I was not wholly disconcerted. A telegram from me bespeaking a room "only if not noisy," reply paid, was produced for me at the office, so that the un- derstanding we should meet at Ches- ter rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The same secret principle, however, that had prompted me not absolutely to desire 18 Booth, p. 159. 19 Ian Watt, "The First Paragraph of The Ambassadors: An Explication," Essays in Criticism, 10 (1960), 250-74, reprinted in the Norton "Critical Edition" of the novel, where this passage appears on p. 474. 20 Watt says that the third sentence has "objective analysis ... where the analytic terminology of 'the same secret principle' must be the responsibility of the narrator" while "'with all respect to dear old Waymarsh' is obviously Strether's licensed familiarity." These limit the range of Strether's possible thoughts drastically.</page><page sequence="12">M L N 1233 Strether not absolutely to desire Waymarsh's presence at the dock, that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it, now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment. They would dine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old Waymarsh-if not even, for that mat- ter, to himself-there was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other. The principle I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most newly disem- barked of the two men, wholly instinctive-the fruit of a sharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find himself looking, after so much separa- tion, into his comrade's face, his busi- ness would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this counte- nance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first "note," of Europe. Mixed with everything was the ap- prehension, already, on Strether's part, that it would, at best, through- out, prove the note of Europe in quite a sufficient degree.

Mixed with everything was the apprehension, al- ready, on my part, that it would, at best, throughout, prove the note of Europe in quite a sufficient degree. Attribution rests on one explicit phrase, "operated to make him feel," but the notion of quoting environments allows us to know the source of the rest. The only problem with the tidy picture is the story-teller's clause, "I have just mentioned." While this does intro- duce an explicit speaker different from Strether, I question whether it is substantial or personal, or just part of the mechanics of relating the story. It is an enormous gap between the kinds of authorial intrusion we find in James21 and the direct interpretation 21 In the first four "Books" of Ambassadors, about a third of the novel, I found eight instances of "our friend," about five "poor Strether" remarks, the sentence from the first paragraph and one more like it ("the meditation I describe"). The only substantial comment I saw was "He met you as if you had knocked and he had bidden you enter" in I, 2. James uses quite a few more of both kinds of intrusion in his earlier works-"Daisy Miller" has five of the "I have mentioned" clauses. None of these, I would argue, establishes much of a personality for the story-teller. Robert Champigny, "Implicitness in Narrative Fiction," PMLA 85 (1970), pp. 988-91, "If the narration does not posit a narrator, the critic should not, in my opinion, give way to his taste for personification and set up a narrating character who can but be mythical (i.e., neither historical, nor fictional, yet both),"</page><page sequence="13">1234 DONALD ROSS, JR. and comment which grace other works. One example, among many, from Hawthorne's conclusion to The Scarlet Letter can show that gap: "The reader may choose among these theories. We have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent, and would gladly, now that it has done its office, erase its deep print out of our own brain, where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness." If a passage can be attributed to one character it is not necessary to make claims for several voices-author, narrator, character-all somehow speaking and commenting on each other with the same set of words. Attributed narration can include judgments of other characters and events, testimony and confession, and conjectures about the motives and thoughts of other characters-in fact, every- thing a story needs. If it is so trivial to change from attributed to first-person narra- tion, why would anyone trouble to use the less direct mode? James's preface to The Ambassadors gives his reason: "[T]he first person, in the long piece, is a form foredoomed to looseness, and that loose- ness, never much my affair, had never been so little so as on this particular occasion." Technically, first-person narration demands that the narrator be at all events, or that she or he hear of them through letters or other witnesses. LordJim shows how elaborate the problem can become. A first-person narrator needs to survive the events-witness the re- scue of the prisoner in Poe's "The Pit and the Pendulum." Such physical details can also be depicted in third-person attributed nar- ratives, and may confirm the source of a passage. Lawrence's "The Overtone" has a long section devoted to Will Renshaw's memory of a traumatic event from the first months of his marriage, a flashback which is sparked by events at a party which is the present time of the story. The passage ends with this paragraph: "It was a thought he could not bear. Rising softly, because she [his wife] was still talking, he went out into the night." We hear no more of what she says, because Renshaw leaves the scene. Using third-person narra- tion lets an author present the thoughts of a character up to the moment of his death. An example from Lawrence is the end of a long passage of horrible psychological decay from "The Prussian Officer": Then again, his consciousness reasserted itself. He roused on to his elbow and stared at the gleaming mountains. There they ranked, all</page><page sequence="14">M L N 1235 still and wonderful between earth and heaven. He stared till his eyes went black, and the mountains, as they stood in their beauty, so clean and cool, seemed to have it, that which was lost in him. IV When the Soldiers found him, three hours later, he was lying with his face over his arm, his black hair giving off heat under the sun. But he was still alive. Seeing the open, black mouth the young sol- diers dropped him in horror. A credible first-person narrator cannot get this close to his death- bed. A more important aspect of attributed narration can only be speculated about, but it may come close to the real syntax of thought. I suspect that the mind does not represent itself (as in "I see that ugly man"), but presupposes itself ("that man is ugly"). Whatever the psycholinguistic reality, the third-person apparatus is less obtrusive and may be more subtle. Another example from Lawrence, "A Modern Lover," shows how the features combine for a gentle introduction into a character's thoughts. The story begins with an objective, external description of a landscape: "The road was heavy with mud." This sort of narration goes to the middle of the second paragraph, where we read the first telling word, "The abandoned road used to seem clean and firm." The auxiliary verb establishes a past time and "seem" needs to have an agent, which appears in the next sentence: "Cyril Mersham stopped to look... ". The general progress of the first page is from the externally por- trayed mud to the "fabulous heap" of turnips, and, at the start of the fourth paragraph to "It was all very wonderful and glamorous here, in the old places that had seemed so ordinary." The introduc- tion links the verb seem, statements about Cyril's sensing ("He came near to it, and saw . . . "), and finally sentimental reactions. It is important to the theme of the story that Cyril glamorizes a walk through the mud and distorts the reality of the town he is revisit- ing. Later we see him romanticize his perceptions about Muriel, his former girl friend, and about Tom, her present suitor. The narra- tion is only attributed to Cyril, never to the others; Muriel and Tom are conjectured about but give no direct testimony in narration. At the start of Section V we are told that "The talk drifted for some time." Since Cyril is bored by their conversation, we do not get an account of it. The narration is not always judgmental-the actions and "stage business" are given objectively. The tension between</page><page sequence="15">1236 DONALD ROSS, JR. sentimentalizing and objectivity helps make the story's ending am- biguous. Cyril seems so sure of his victory over Tom, but the last sentence notes Muriel's failure to say good-bye. She cuts off the relationship, and Cyril's optimism is ill-founded. Third-person attributed narration can give as convincing a pic- ture of a character's thoughts and feelings as can narration with I (depending, of course, on the artist's skill). A significant technical difference is that the author writing in third-person can shift easily from the mind of one character to another. A first-person narrative can give privileged testimony from only one source; that source can but conjecture about the others. We have already looked at some parts of "The Shadow in the Rose Garden" attributed to the wife. One such passage ends with "This was torture to her." Then follow non-commital speaker identifiers ("she replied"), and a paragraph of apparently external stage direction: "He took a few strides, and stood obstinately, looking out of the window." After two brief speeches the following paragraph is clearly attributed to the hus- band: His hands began to twitch. It exasperated him, that she was no more sensible of him than if he did not exist. Turning to her at length, driven, he asked ... This shift lets the reader see how the wife's bizarre actions affect the husband. The interior view of the man is needed, since the revelation or enlightenment of the final paragraph is his, not hers-"At last he had learned the width of the breach between them." Narration in another story, "The Blind Man," is attributed vari- ously to three characters-Isabel, her blind husband, Maurice, and his potential rival, Bertie. Table 1 shows where the shifts occur; the brief quoted phrases should allow the reader to follow the changes in Lawrence's story. Shifts are frequent after the rather long meditative passage which takes place as Isabel waits for Bertie to arrive. Most shifts begin with objective or non-judgmental lan- guage, followed by a clearly defined attributing sentence. For example, the dinner scene, Number 3, starts: He went downstairs. Isabel was alone in the dining-room. She watched him enter, head erect, his feet tentative. He looked [to her] so strong-blooded and healthy .... It is not important whether the objective words are labeled as being</page><page sequence="16">M L N 1237 external narration, or are attributed to the character because of the general environment. Table 1. Shifting Attributions in Lawrence's "Blind Man" To whom Setting Attributing phrases; page in parenthesis attributed 1. House to "Isabel Pervin was listening ... " (347) Isabel barn ". . . She heard him in the bathroom." (355) 2. Bedroom "Pervin moved about almost unconsciously ... " (355) Maurice ". .. he knew it was the outcome of his own weakness" (356) 3. Dinner "She watched him enter ..." (357) Isabel (One paragraph) "The blind man struck his hand ..." Maurice (357) "Isabel glanced at them ..." (357) Isabel (One paragraph) "Maurice was feeling. .." (358) Maurice "Isabel's eyes lighting up ... " (358) Isabel "... Bertie made her conscious of a strangness [sic]" (359) 4. After meal "Bertie noticed a slight weariness ...

Outside to "He shrank from the wet..." (362) Bertie barn " . . He [Maurice] seemed to be listening to hear if it were real." (364) 6. Return to "Isabel, as they came, thought their footsteps ..." (364) Isabel house "He was like a mollusc whose shell is broken." (365) Proper interpretation of "The Blind Man" is contingent on our awareness of these changes. Thus the ironic references to impaired vision in the first section come through Isabel. The walk to the barn is told in these terms, "... she was unsure of her footing ... she was aware of the presence of the dark hind-quarters of the horses, though she could not see them ... she saw only darkness.... While he was so utterly invisible she was afraid of him." No narrator's voice points up the moral blindness of the world; rather, Isabel is aware of these ironies at some level of consciousness-the narrative mode is fully integrated with the information it carries about the characters. "The Blind Man" ends with a strange scene in the barn where Maurice forces Bertie to touch the scars on his face. Narra- tion of these events is attributed to the confused Bertie, and the final significance of the events thereby becomes indeterminate. Be-</page><page sequence="17">1238 DONALD ROSS, JR. cause we are not privy to Maurice's thoughts or motives at this scene, we cannot know whether he sincerely tries to create a bond of "blood-awareness" with Bertie, or whether he humiliates the pos- sible rival, since he had learned of Bertie's physical timidity from a retracted hand-touching episode during dinner. Lawrence's stories have illustrated the range of variables that defines third-person attributed narration. We obviously must know the sources of comments and judgments to interpret these stories accurately. Identifying the mode is also a prior condition to our discussing narrative styles. As Dolezel says: "The study of narrative styles is fascinating on its own merits; however, it will gain a firm theoretical base only when the idiosyncratic styles are related to the underlying systems of narrative modes."22 Herman Melville's "Be- nito Cereno" and Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage are both dominated by single attributed narrations, except for the court depositions in "Benito Cereno" which do not directly concern us here. The two stories have suffered over the years because the narrative mode has not been correctly identified, and a confusion of comments about authorial and narrator's intrusion has resulted. For the purpose of this essay, it is useful to comment in advance that the narrative styles of these two stories are somewhere near the extremes, with Crane's attributing apparatus being frequent, insis- tent, and Melville's being slight and subtle. "Benito Cereno" has been recognized for a considerable success in holding the reader's interest in the mystery of what is really happening on board the ship which the American captain, Delano, chances to visit. The major characters on that ship, the Spanish ex-officer, Cereno, and the successful revolutionary, Babu, act in ways which place the reader and a naive Delano on one side and those on board the San Dominick on the other, each having different information and insight. One masterful aspect of the story is that most readers solve the mystery long before Delano detects it; as a result, the reader spends much time watching Delano struggle with his inability to see what seems obvious.23 The Captain's flaw is his racism. The narration is laced with a complete catalogue of stereotyping: "the African love of bright colors and fine shows"; Babu's "zeal ... has gained for the negro the repute of making the 22 Doleiel, p. 12. 23 I agree in almost all particulars with the interpretation by Ruth Vanderhaar in "A Re-examination of 'Benito Cereno, ' " AL 40 (1968), 179-91.</page><page sequence="18">M L N 1239 most pleasing body-servant in the world," he has a "grin of mere animal humor," "Most negroes are natural valets and hair- dressers," the nursing mothers provoke: "There's naked nature, now; pure tenderness and love, thought Captain Delano, well pleased." This theme is not at all disguised: "Captain Delano took to negroes ... just as other men to Newfoundland dogs," and it is explicit: "The whites, too, by nature, were the shrewder race." The camera-eye in the story is limited almost exclusively to De- lano. I find one exception, a single interjected remark: "Upon this, unperceived by the American, the two blacks eyed the sailor in- tently." The depositions are given to expand beyond the exceed- ingly limited perspective Delano can have; he is so bigoted that we could not even trust him as a reporter on the trial in Lima. The bulk of the story is not an account of events and words; it is rather a rich series of comments, ruminations, similes, and metaphors which are inspired by the events. The first view of the boat, with adjectives and adverbial remarks underscored, gives an example: As the whale-boat drew more and more nigh, the cause of the peculiar pipe-clayed aspect of the stranger was seen [by Delano] in the slovenly neglect pervading her. The spars, ropes, and great part of the bulwarks, looked [to Delano] wooly, from long unacquaintance with the scraper, tar, and the brush. Her keel seemed [to Delano] laid, her ribs put together, and she launched, from Ezekiel's Valley of Dry Bones. The descriptions can be attributed because Melville quite carefully reminds us that we get Delano's thoughts. Through most of the story every other paragraph has a formula like "Captain Delano bethought him that," or "to Captain Delano's mind"; these clearly have scope over the full environment. The mystery is enhanced by the fact that attributing words and clauses are rare in the first dozen or so pages. This has apparently led Wayne Booth to be confused at the flowery ominousness which is given us in the third paragraph: "Melville does not try to convince us that Captain De- lano himself felt the foreshadowing of deeper shadows to come ... [he is] clearly addressing us directly, rhetorically."24 In truth De- lano is often inclined to use picturesque similes ("the surface like waved lead") and metaphors ("The sky seemed a gray surtout"). And he thinks often of a sense of "enchantment" which is in his mind before and during the encounter. What may have confused 24 Booth, p. 203.</page><page sequence="19">1240 DONALD ROSS, JR. Booth is that the first two paragraphs are an external narrative and are notjudgmental; the third paragraph has just the slight clue that it could be attributed, the verb "seemed," but, as in other examples, the next paragraph gives us the source and even a name: "To Captain Delano's surprise, the stranger, viewed through the glass, showed no colors." Booth thinks that "one certainly cannot settle the question by appeal to rules about point of view," but the prob- lem is rather that the rules which Booth has in mind are not adequate. If the reader figures out Melville's narrative strategy, and the increasing frequency of attributing elements help in this regard, then the problem of Delano's racially motivated moral blindness is opened and the reader can gloat early on at his having solved the mystery. Crane's strategy in The Red Badge of Courage is to create a very great distance between a lyrical and learned narrative and the country lad it depicts. Melville's Captain was from an upper social class and position, so that references in the unquoted parts of the story to Froissart, a Kaffir guard of honor, or the game of chess are not surprising. As the Captain says in his last interview with Benito Cereno, he has " 'good-nature, compassion, and clarity.' " His speeches are reasonably close in tone, syntax, and vocabulary to the unquoted parts of the story. The narrative parts of Crane's story cover a wide range. Some paragraphs are quite speech-like and give a sense that a person is "talking" in thoughts: This sight also filled him with wonder. The brigade was hurrying briskly to be gulped into the infernal mouths of the war god. What matter of men were they, anyhow? Ah, it was some wonderous breed! Or else they didn't comprehend-the fools. All the marks of "free indirect style" or interior monologue are here-rhetorical questions, interjections, exclamations, fragments. The impressionistic painting of scenes, for which Red Badge is justly famous, is explained as being a process in Fleming's mind which combines real and imaginary events. The following passage both describes the mental phenomenon and illustrates how metaphors are the result of the process: As he hastened [toward a battle] there passed through his mind pictures of stupendous conflicts. His accumulated thought upon such sub- jects was used to form scenes. The noise was as the voice of an eloquent being, describing.</page><page sequence="20">M L N 1241 The next paragraph in the eighth chapter is filled with nearly hysterical fantasies about the threatening forest: Sometimes the brambles formed chains and tried to hold him back. Trees, confronting him, stretched out their arms and forbade him to pass. After its previous hostility this new resistance of the forest filled him with a fine bitterness. It seemed that Nature could not be quite ready to kill him. Aside from tracing the soldier's varying attitudes toward nature, the other central metaphors of the book are derived from the hero's mind. In the first chapter, "he lay in his bunkpondering upon [bravery]. He tried to mathematically prove to himself that he would not run from a battle." This search for a geometry of heroism is linked to the mechanical aspect of armies: The battle was like the grinding of an immense and terrible machine to him. Its complexities and powers, its grim processes, fascinated him. He must go close and see it produce corpses. During Fleming's more rational moments the sequence of mental acts is spelled out explicitly and the language becomes not lyrical but legalistic. Attribution is by frequent indirect-thought clauses: He told himself that, despite his unprecedented suffering, he had never lost his greed for a victory, yet, he said, in a half-apologetic manner to his conscience, he could not but know that a defeat for the army this time might mean many favorable things for him... Thus, many men of courage, he considered, would be obliged to desert the colors and scurry like chickens. ... And if he himself could believe in his virtuous perfection, he conceived that there would be small trouble in convincing all others. All these are thoughts of a person whose usual speech is "Yes," who stutters, "I-I-that is-why-I," and who talks in dialect, "B' jiminey, we're generaled by a lot'a lunkheads." His utilitarian lan- guage is quite limited; he is barely articulate. Perhaps for this reason, the attributing words and clauses are quite frequent. A sample was taken from both stories, and different kinds of attribut- ing verbs were counted, then scaled as the number per 1,000 words (about 21/2 printed pages). Type of verb "Benito Cereno" Red Badge Crane/Melville think 2.5 9.0 3.6 to 1 see-metaphoric 1.9 4.9 2.6 to 1 seem 1.6 0.8 0.5 to 1 say-mentally 0 0.9 Total 6.0 15.5 2.6 to 1</page><page sequence="21">1242 DONALD ROSS, JR. Crane uses explicit attributions about two and a half times more often than does Melville; his verbs which discuss thinking are even more frequent. Melville has no interior monologue or mental say- ing in the passages sampled (about one third of the story), while Crane uses the device rather often. The only exception to the gen- eral pattern is that Melville uses seem twice as often as Crane. Another way to talk about these numbers is that we are reminded of Delano's being the source about once a page, about once in every three paragraphs, as compared to three or four reminders in a page of Red Badge. Taken together, the two stories cover rather a wide range of fictional topics. Melville's story is or seems to be intellectual, with its treatment of complex and then-controversial issues concerning slavery. His plot is personal and philosophical, a mystery-tale set- ting for the theme of the distance between appearances and realities. Crane's novel has a thriller plot about initiation and man- hood, an obvious, public theme concerning bravery and responsi- bility, and some of the more vividly painted settings in literature. All the stories we have surveyed tend to use attributed narration as a means to get us close to the thoughts of characters. We have been schooled to believe that a person's thoughts are limited by his language, and so it may be in our world. The creator of a fiction is not bound by this belief. By avoiding the commitment to first- person story telling, a writer does not imply someone with a pen or tape recorder. By using the third-person strategies, both Lawrence and Crane (and other novelists25), can dramatize characters who think far more than they ever could say.26 University of Minnesota 25 John A. Hart talks about a phenomenon like attributed narration in Faulkner's "The Bear" and Intruder in the Dust in "That Not Impossible He: Faulkner's Third- Person Narrator," Studies in Faulkner, Carnegie Series in English, No. 6 (Pittsburgh, 1961), pp. 29-41. Hart does not try to generalize about the narrating devices beyond the two stories, nor does he distinguish between what I have called testimony and conjecture, which he surely would have in an account of first-person tales. 26 This essay makes a strong case that the author's voice is seldom present in fiction; the reader can account for nearly all the sentences in attributed narrations without having to divide the voices. I suspect that the idea of the author-in-his-works is slippery, and is not liable to a formal argument; it is an intuitive response, not transmittable from critic to critic or reader to reader. When someone hears Shakes- peare speaking through Hamlet (no matter how tenuous the argument), the claim cannot be based on a sprinkling of author's or narrator's commentary. Novels and stories, I suggest, are as fully dramatized as plays.</page></plain_text>
