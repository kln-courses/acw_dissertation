Cam- bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990. xv + 358 pp., maps, photos, tab., fig. Price: £ 10.95 The authors claims that "This book is the first comprehensive anthropological study of a rural Chinese community to be carried out by foreign anthropologists in the People's Republic of China since the Revolution of 1949" (xi). This is not true. One needs only to cite the study of Red Flag Commune on the outskirt of Beijing by Chance (1984). The present study focuses largely on Zengbu, a Production Brigade of the Chashan Commune in Dong- guan County, Guangdong Province, and is based, in part, on field trips taken during 1979-80 and the early 1980s. The book begins with a description of "traditional Zengbu" as it existed before the Liberation in 1949 and goes on to an examination of the Land Reform of 1951-52, the struggle of the peasants against the landlord-despots, and land distribution. The subsequent chapter comprises of an account of the evolution of collectivization: the mutual aid groups, the Agricultural Cooperatives, the Great Leap Forward, the formation of the communes in 1958, and the reorganization of the communes in the early 1960s. The authors maintain that the Great Leap Forward of 1958 was actually a millenarian movement conceived by the Chinese to yield a perfect social order. The Great Leap Forward, as discussed in the book, refers to the events associated with the initial formation of the communes: the establishment of public canteens, the promotion of the ideal of extreme egalitarianism, the neglect of work incentive, and the official endorsement of the procedure of inflating production output records. On the failure of the Great Leap Forward, the authors make a strange evaluation in view of the empirical data presented: "Then, when it became clear that the policies of the Great Leap Forward were not the perfect policies that would produce the perfect social order, they were discarded in their entirety. From the anthropological point of view, this is to ignore the possibility that a structure might have advantages and disadvantages, that it could be modified to suit a series of social purposes, that good results will not be immediate . . ." (74). Fol- lowing the setback during the Great Leap Forward, the communes were reorganized and reduced in scale but were not discarded. There were absolutely no advan- tages, political or economical, in maintaining the system as it was first set up. The extreme egalitarianism was not economically feasible. The public canteens obviously could not function in the current socio-economic milieu. Falsifying and exaggerating output in grain production actually brought famine to many parts of the country. Yet these anthropologists advise that the Chinese should have waited for the "good results" and that "new struc- tural forms that remain in place for a mere six months can scarcely be called structure at all" (75). In their discussions of the Great Leap Forward, there is an important omission. Setting up "backyard furnace" for steel production was an important part of the Great Leap Forward and commonly occurred in the countryside during 1958. This reviewer knows that the "backyard furnace" movement happened in the Dong- guan County, if not in Zengbu. In any case this should be mentioned whether it occurred locally or not, since discussions in the book frequently alternate between the local and the national levels. In a chapter entitled "Maoist Society: The Pro- duction Team," the writers assert that "The cadres had great control over the lives and fortunes of their fellow villagers .... Maoist Zengbu was a kind of bureaucratic feudalism, with party cadres, closely controlling peas- ants who had been structurally immobilized in their teams. Peasants were separated from urban residents by legal restrictions creating a caste-like barrier against both geographical and social mobility that was virtually impenetrable .... The structural similarities between Maoist bureaucratic serfdom and the classical forms of European feudal serfdom are clear .... [The] Maoist state created a set of serf-like conditions more classically 'feudal' than the pre-Liberation society, in which peas- ants controlled their own labor, and could leave their villages" (96 f.). However, the evidence presented does not sup- port this view of immense authority of the cadres. The production team is actually pictured as a far more democratic and less rigidly structured organization than the conclusion above implies. The writers observed that Anthropos 86.1991</page><page sequence="2">Rezensionen 635 team leaders were elected and team elections were held in 1970, 1975, and 1979 in Zengbu (102). The wives and children of Zengbu team leaders reportedly com- plained that, in order to avoid criticism, the team leaders tended to give them the hardest and least rewarding work. Although traditionally one was obliged morally to favor one's family and relatives, team leaders were fearful that accusations of favoritism would result in less respect from and diminished authority over team members (106). The teams provided social security to the weak and the elderly, and an essential framework for mecha- nizing agriculture and easing the labor burden on the peasants. "They guaranteed the peasants an assured food supply, and the opportunity to work, where there had previously been unemployment and starvation" (128). The writers also infer: "With private ownership of the means of production and private inheritance eliminated, and employment and entrepreneurship outside the team context greatly restricted, the team was a force in oppo- sition to the re-emergence of economic inequalities and class stratification" (127). If this is the case, how could China during the Mao Zedong years have "created a set of serf-like conditions more classically 'feudal' than the pre-Liberation society"? On this point, the writers conveniently omit any mentioning of the landlordism and the landless peasantry before the Liberation in 1949. Moreover, the same argument is inconsistent with their stated view of the early Land Reform as "a creative rath- er than a destructive movement," welding the peasants into "a coherent power-holding community" (57). During the Mao Zedong years, the government gave only a small number of people from the rural areas official permission to move and work in cities and towns. Individuals could move in with family members who have been granted urban registration, although such individuals might not receive subsidies normally available to urban residents. There were the Worker- Peasant-Soldier students who attended the colleges in urban centres, and who, upon graduation, were assigned employment which might or might not be in rural areas. There were the high school graduates of the urban centres who were "sent down" to the countryside and lived among the peasants. These people exemplify the restricted numbers of migrants between the rural and urban centres. Rural-urban migration results in the for- mation of squatter-residence and slums in Third World countries and has to be regulated. But to say that in the People's Republic, "peasants were separated from urban residents by legal restrictions creating a caste-like barrier against both geographical and social mobility that was virtually impenetrable" (97) is way off the mark. There is a secondary but nonetheless serious schol- arly error in the same chapter examining the production team, the writers argue that "the masculine emphasis of peasant social thinking is reflected ... in using the masculine pronoun" (96). They are off the mark again. Whether in putonghua (i.e., Mandarin in the book) or in the dialect of Dongguan, there is no gender differentia- tion amongst the pronouns. Because the writers regard both the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution as revitalization move- ments, they logically consider Chinese Communism a religion, applying Durkheim's integrative functional- ist definition of religion which is "a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things . . . which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them" (284). However, since Chinese Communism is "non-supernaturalistic and non-anthropomorphic" (284), the authors have to focus their discussions on party ethic and devotion, instead of relating religion to the attitudes, beliefs, and practices pertaining to supernatural power as Durkheim generally did in his work. Accordingly, the authors can now assert that "the local party secretaries are priests of the faith and keepers of the ideology . . ." (284), and can then proceed to make analogies between early Calvinism and Chinese Communism (290). For example, the authors observe: "There are other significant social parallels in the experiences of cadres and Calvinists. The early Calvinists were taught to be suspicious and aloof, even from family and friends, because it was not possible to distinguish the saved from the damned . . .. Similarly, party cadres must maintain social distance even from colleagues. In the shifting sands which are the arena of inner-party struggle, a fellow party member might come to be denounced as anti-party (the equivalent, in this context, of being damned) And, like the Calvinists, cadres were supposed to remain aloof from the profane demands of family, kin, and friends" (290 f.). Individual members vying for power within polit- ical settings, patron-client relations, factions, the mani- pulation of various sources òf support, accusations of conflict of interest - these are issues frequently studied and analyzed in political anthropology. Potter and Potter prefer reasoning by analogy in order to demonstrate their view of Chinese Communism as a religion. Unfortunate- ly, in their drawing of parallels between early Calvinism and Chinese Communism, one fundamental discrepancy between the two is ignored: the belief in an omnipotent and omnipresent God versus atheism. In this book, the word "religion" is so generalized that its meaning is seriously undermined. The authors purportedly "seek to explain the per- sistence of the deep structure of Chinese culture" (under cover). Actually, the distinction between surface mani- festation and deep structure is not discussed until more than half way through the book - in chapter 12. When "parallel factors" are drawn between Chinese Commu- nism and Calvinism (chapter 14), are these "parallel factors" drawn from the deep structure or are they mere surface manifestations? Why are the authors not making the distinction between deep structure and surface man- ifestation when they embellish on Chinese Communism as a religion? In this book, the use of anthropological concepts is uneven, and there is a political position which is well known but not explicitly spelt out. The authors' political view and values frequently clash with their own fact material and analysis. Wing-sam Chow Anthropos 86.1991</page></plain_text>
