SHIMP Professor of Marketing at the University of South Carolina DAVID E. SPROTT Assistant Professor of Marketing at Washington State University Abstract A number of studies have investigated the self-congruity hypothesis, which predicts that consumers prefer products and brands whose images closely correspond to their own self-concepts. Support for this hypothesis has been equivocal, and investigators have explored methodological factors and moderators that might account for the discrepant results. In this research we introduce a new variable, product ownership status, as a theoretically important moderator of self-congruity effects. Our study demonstrates that product ownership does indeed moderate these effects, as the self-congruity effect observed under conditions of ownership was eliminated in the absence of ownership. Key words: Ownership, self-concept, self-congruity effects, evaluative judgments, moderator effects While ownership of possessions and the self-concept of individuals each represent areas of inquiry with longstanding traditions (cf. Malhotra 1988; Rudmin 1986), researchers only recently have begun to consider the nexus of these topics. Much of the existing work has focused on the role of the consumer's self-concept in product evaluation and choice (cf. Malhotra 1988; Sirgy 1982a). Self-congruity, the theoretical framework driving such research, predicts that a consumer will exhibit a preference for the brand or product whose image most closely corresponds to his/her own self-concept (e.g., Dolich 1969; Gardner and Levy 1955; Levy 1959; Malhotra 1988; Ross 1971; Sirgy 1982a). Specifically, we present results of a study that examined whether product ownership (versus nonowner- ship) influences the extent to which self-congruity effects will be manifested. Although ownership has typically been viewed as an outcome of self-congruity effects, the present research examines whether product ownership might serve as an important determinant of self-congruity effects. Prior to reporting our method and results, we review two streams of relevant research.</page><page sequence="2">76 BARONE, SHIMP, SPROTT 1. The role of self-concept in consumer behavior Researchers have considered a variety of ways in which consumers' self-concepts might influence behavior. (For comprehensive reviews, see Claiborne and Sirgy 1990; Malhotra 1988; Sirgy 1982a.) The self-congruity hypothesis, as noted above, has received particular attention and reflects a more general phenomenon of self-consistency, whereby people think and behave in a manner consistent with their self-concepts (Epstein 1980; Schlenker 1975). The self-congruity hypothesis has been applied to understand better the effectiveness of a variety of marketing strategies, such as advertising (e.g., Hong and Zinkhan 1995; Johar and Sirgy 1991) and retailing (e.g., Sirgy and Samli 1985; Sirgy et al. 1991). However, the primary focus of research in this domain has been consumer evaluations of and reactions to products (e.g., Belch and Landon 1977; Dolich 1969; Landon 1974; Martin and Bel- lizzi 1982; Ross 1971; Sirgy 1985). Conflicting evidence from early studies (cf. Malhotra 1988; Sirgy 1982a) spurred additional inquiries aimed at identifying variables that might account for the inconsistent findings. As with other research that has examined the role of personality variables in consumer behavior (e.g., Kassarjian 1971; Lastovicka and Joachimsthaler 1988; see also Epstein 1979), efforts have been made to determine whether methodological factors (e.g., measurement effects) could account for the equivo- cal findings on the self-congruity hypothesis (e.g., Belch and Landon 1977; Dolich 1969; Green, Maheshwari, and Rao 1969; Sirgy et al. 1997). Other efforts have focused on identifying moderating variables such as product conspicuousness (Dolich 1969; Ross 1971), response mode (Hong and Zinkhan 1995; Sirgy 1982b), and the dimension along with congruency between self-image and product image occurs (Dolich 1969; Landon 1974; Sirgy 1985; Sirgy et al. 1991). In the next section, we discuss the role of product ownership, a moderating variable previously unexplored in the self-congruity literature. We begin this discussion with a review of relevant research on ownership. 2. Ownership effects and self-congruity Researchers from various disciplines have examined the manner in which people evaluate owned items. Of particular interest to the current investigation are two streams of re- search, the endowment effect (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1990; Thaler 1980) and the mere-ownership effect (Barone, Shimp, and Sprott 1997a, 1997b; Beggan 1992; Beggan and Allison 1997). Each of these frameworks predicts that evaluators will exhibit a pref- erence (in the form of more favorable evaluations) for an item when it is owned versus not owned. In particular, research on the endowment effect reveals that individuals who are given (and hence own) an item require a greater monetary sum to give that product up (i.e., "willingness to accept," or WTA) than nonowners would be willing to pay for that same item (i.e., "willingness to pay," or WTP). Work on the mere-ownership effect (Beg- gan 1992) provides similar evidence of biased evaluations for owners versus nonowners on more traditional evaluative measures that are employed in the present investigation.1</page><page sequence="3">PRODUCT OWNERSHIP AS A MODERATOR OF SELF-CONGRUITY EFFECTS 77 Considering ownership as a moderator of the self-congruity hypothesis is particularly interesting insofar as this hypothesis predicts that correspondence between the consumer's self-concept and a product's image will result in more favorable evaluations of the prod- uct, presumably culminating in a higher likelihood of purchase and thus ownership. 2.1 Ownership and self-concept effects in consumer behavior The self-concept has been viewed as a collection of self-schemas comprised of cognitive information representing generalizations about one's self (Markus 1977; Markus, Smith, and Moreland 1985). These self-schemas have been implicated as a means of accounting for self-congruity effects (Hong and Zinkhan 1995; Sirgy and Samli 1985; Sirgy et al. 1991). In particular, it is presumed that self-schemas are activated when consumers en- counter a product; once activated, these schemas can impact both input and output aspects of information processing (Markus 1977). Activated self-schemas help determine "whether information is attended to, how it is structured, how much importance is at- tached to it, and what happens to it subsequently" (Markus 1977, p. 64). In the present context, self-schemas can prompt consumers to consider the congruence between a prod- uct's image and their own self-concept, a process integral to self-congruity effects. Im- portantly, self-schema activation would appear contingent upon the stimulus (e.g., a prod- uct) being viewed as possessing at least some minimum level of personal relevance. In these instances, the stimulus should be capable, by virtue of its relevance to the self, of cueing or activating from memory information pertaining to the self. For example, high- risk purchases such as homes and automobiles should likely be perceived as quite self- involving. Accordingly, self-schematic information may be evoked in a relatively sponta- neous and automatic manner for consumers contemplating the purchase of such products. Moreover, as suggested earlier, activation of this information should augment the potential for consumers to assess the congruence between the product's image and their self- concept, thereby increasing the likelihood of self-congruity effects. However, much of everyday consumer behavior takes place with respect to low involv- ing and relatively mundane products (Kassarjian 1978). It may be unlikely that informa- tion regarding the self will be activated spontaneously when consumers encounter such low involving products. Under these circumstances, consumers may not evaluate the fit of the product's image to their self-concept - thereby undermining the potential for self- congruity effects to emerge - unless they are otherwise prompted to do so. A context in which the relevance of such mundane products may be increased is when ownership (or impending ownership) of these items is involved. As suggested by several consumer researchers (e.g., Belk 1988; Wallendorf and Arnould 1988), ownership can transform the meaning of products to consumers: it is through the process of ownership that items can become part of the "extended" self (Belk 1988) and, as a consequence, achieve the personal relevance that makes them instrumental in the way consumers view themselves. The preceding discussion suggests that making ownership of mundane products salient to consumers can enhance the likelihood that self-schemas will be activated when such items are evaluated. Accordingly, self-congruity effects (i.e., more favorable evaluations</page><page sequence="4">78 BARONE, SHIMP, SPROTT of products possessing images that correspond to the consumer's self-concept) should be more likely for owners versus nonowners of mundane products. In light of the preceding discussion, we offer these hypotheses: Hp Under conditions of ownership, self-congruity effects will occur. That is, a product possessing an image that corresponds to the consumer's self-concept will receive more favorable evaluations than will a product with an image that does not. H2: Under conditions of nonownership, self-congruity effects will not occur. That is, a product with an image that corresponds to the consumer's self-concept will receive evaluations similar to those given to a product with an image that does not. 3. Methods 3.1 Subjects, design, and procedure One-hundred and forty-nine undergraduate business students were randomly assigned to the cells of a 2 (ownership of target item) X 2 (image of target item) between-subjects design.2 A third factor in the design was derived from a median split on subjects' mea- sured self-concept. Subjects participated in groups of approximately four and were seated at individual tables out of the view of other individuals in the session. Participants were informed that the study was designed to understand their reactions to specialty advertising items (cf. Beggan 1992); they subsequently evaluated four objects enclosed in individual boxes on the table. The target item (an inexpensive plastic key chain) was contained in either the first or the fourth box, depending on the particular experimental condition to which the subject was assigned. Three filler products (a highlighter pen, a pair of sunglasses, and a water bottle) were presented in the remaining boxes. After being told that each product was similarly valued at approximately $2.00, subjects evaluated each of the products individually and in the order in which they were presented. Subjects opened a box, examined the item therein, and evaluated it before moving on to the next product. This process was repeated for each of the four objects. After evaluating all four items, subjects' self-concepts were assessed using Rosenberg's (1965) ten-item scale. For subjects in the ownership group, a note was enclosed with the target key chain informing them that this product was theirs for participating in the study; no such note was provided with the key chain for subjects in the nonownership group. The image of the product was manipulated by varying the brand embossed on the key chain. Based on the results of a pretest, Porsche was selected for the high-image condition, while Hyundai was elected for the low. The self-concept factor was derived from the average of subjects' responses to Rosenberg's (1965) scale (a = .73). Specifically, these scores were split at the midpoint (Median = 7.7 on a nine-point scale) to develop low- and high-self-concept</page><page sequence="5">PRODUCT OWNERSHIP AS A MODERATOR OF SELF-CONGRUITY EFFECTS 79 groups.3 The mean score for the high self-concept group (M = 8.32) was significantly [t141 = 16.10, p &lt; 0.001] greater than that obtained for the low self-concept group (M = 6.84; t,41 = 16.10, p &lt; .001). 3.2 Measures The focal dependent variable - the average of three nine-point Likert scale items (a = .75) - was measured by having subjects indicate their agreement that the target key chain was attractive, valuable, and well-designed (cf. Beggan 1992).4 The product image ma- nipulation was assessed by averaging three nine-point scale items (a = .89). Subjects were asked to evaluate the target key chain in a social context by indicating their agree- ment with the following statements: (1) For me to own this item would be looked on favorably by my friends, (2) My friends would evaluate my owning this item in positive terms, and (3) My owning this item would make a good impression on others. As desired, this manipulation check indicated that subjects held a more favorable product image for the key chain bearing the Porsche (M = 4.06) than that adorned with the Hyundai logo (M = 3.47; t141 = 2.18, p &lt; .05). 4. Results It was hypothesized that self-congruity effects should occur when products are evaluated in the context of ownership (H^, but should not occur under conditions of nonownership (H2). Given that self-congruity effects predict a two-way interaction between consumer self-concept and product image, H! and H2 collectively imply an ownership X self- concept X product image interaction. To test these hypotheses, subjects' evaluations of the target key chain product were submitted to a 2 X 2 X 2 ANOVA. Cell means are presented in the Table. Evidence for a self-congruity effect is revealed by a significant two-way self-concept X product image interaction (F, 135 = 4.27, p &lt; .05). While the high image product (M = 4.07) received more favorable evaluations than the low image product (M = 3.28) for Table. Descriptive statistics for key chain evaluations.

Importantly, in support of Hx and H2, this two-way interaction was qualified by the ownership factor such that the three-way interaction involving ownership, self-concept, and product image was significant (Fj 135 = 9.17, p &lt; .01).5 Follow-up analyses ascer- tained whether self-congruity effects (in the form of a self concept X product image interaction) occurred for the ownership group (in support of H2) but not for the nonown- ership group (in support of H2). As illustrated in the Figure, the interaction between self-concept and product image was significant for the ownership group (F1 63 = 14.40, p &lt; .001) but not for the nonownership group (F1&gt;72 = 0.43, p &gt; .1). Simple main effects tests within each self-concept group were undertaken to more precisely delineate the nature of the self-concept X product image interaction. As ex- pected, a significant effect of product image (t34 ^.t^ = 1.80, p &lt; .05) was observed for the low self-concept group who owned the keychain. This group exhibited more favorable evaluations of the key chain bearing the logo of the low-image (Hyundai; M = 3.98) than of the high-image (Porsche; M = 3.12) product. A main effect of product image (t29 (1_toii) = 3.39, p &lt; .01) was also detected for subjects in the high self-concept group. As anticipated, and in contrast to the low self-concept group, these subjects provided more favorable evaluations for the key chain bearing the logo of the high-image (Porsche; M = 4.54) versus the low-image (Hyundai; M = 2.58) product. Taken together, these results support Hj. Consistent with H2, no significant effects (including the critical self-concept X product image interaction) were detected on evaluations of the key chain provided by subjects in the non-ownership group (p &gt; .1 for all effects). 5. Discussion 5.7. Theoretical implications To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first that has portrayed product owner- ship as a moderator of self-congruity effects rather than the outcome of such effects. We have argued that the congruity between a product's image and the consumer's self-concept manifests itself differently depending on whether an evaluated product is owned or not owned. Our empirical evidence reveals that evaluations of an owned product reflect con- gruence between a product's image and the consumer's self-concept. Specifically, con- sumers possessing positive self-concepts evaluated the high-image target product more favorably than the corresponding low-image item, whereas the reverse was the case for low self-concept consumers, who judged the low-image target item more positively than the high-image item. This pattern was not repeated for subjects who evaluated, but did not own, the target product. These findings hold implications for both the ownership and self-congruity literatures. In terms of the former, while prior research has focused on identifying and testing factors that influence ownership effects (e.g., Beggan 1992; Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler</page><page sequence="7">PRODUCT OWNERSHIP AS A MODERATOR OF SELF-CONGRUITY EFFECTS 8 1 Figure 1.

In establishing ownership status as an important moderator of self-congruity effects, the current research contributes to ownership theory. The present results also extend prior research on self-congruity theory. In particular, inconsistencies in prior research might be attributable to product ownership not being adequately controlled in some of these investigations. Based on the current research, it</page><page sequence="8">82 BARONE, SHIMP, SPROTT would appear that product ownership plays a critical motivational role in determining whether consumers commit the requisite cognitive effort to align product judgments in a manner that reflects congruence between one's self-concept and the product's image. Absent this motivation, as in the case of evaluating a relatively mundane product one does not own, consumers apparently do not expend the cognitive effort that would produce a self-congruity effect. Further investigation is needed to assess the reasonableness of our assumptions concerning the cognitive processes underlying the effects observed here. Future research could also examine whether other motivational factors beyond product ownership are capable of generating self-congruity effects, although ownership is perhaps the most ecologically valid insofar as it represents the goal toward which most marketing efforts are directed. 5.2 Managerial implications Marketing and consumer behavior texts often advocate using the self-concept and encour- age the development of products and advertisements that match target consumers' self- concepts. While such advice is generally reinforced by the self-congruity hypothesis, the results from the current investigation suggest that the effectiveness of this approach may be contingent upon the particular conditions facing the marketer. In particular, this would seem sound advice when marketing tactics are being developed for current owners of a brand and the focus is on customer retention (cf. Kirmani, Sood, and Bridges 1997). However, customer recruitment efforts that target current nonusers would not neccesarily benefit from self-congruity effects, especially for relatively trivial objects. While this discussion suggests that no singular marketing execution aimed at individual's self- concepts will consistently promote more favorable brand evaluation, research by Sen and Johnson (1997) does suggest that "near" forms of ownership (e.g., providing consumers with a coupon) may have effects on product evaluations that are similar to "mere" own- ership (cf. Beggan 1992). It follows that if one can instill a sense of ownership in current nonusers (thereby making prospective ownership of the product salient to these consum- ers), it may be possible to employ the congruity hypothesis for these individuals as well. 5.3. Future Research We are reluctant to conclude that our finding represents an empirical generalization that necessarily extends to other products. We nonetheless think this finding is sufficiently provocative to warrant additional studies to determine its generalizability as well as the limiting conditions where the finding might not obtain. Was there something unique about the inexpensive key chain used in this research that produced an anomalous finding, or can the pattern illustrated in the Figure be expected to persist regardless of product character or expense? Our personal belief is that, in special circumstances, product ownership serves to motivate the cognitive activity that is essential for producing a self-congruity effect. Other motivators - such as inherent product interest, relevance, and aspirational</page><page sequence="9">PRODUCT OWNERSHIP AS A MODERATOR OF SELF-CONGRUITY EFFECTS 83 goals - also may produce self-congruity effects absent of product ownership. We antici- pate that ownership represents a critical moderator of self-congruency primarily when these other motivating factors are absent, such as when products are relatively inexpen- sive, unimportant, or trivial. Thus, in inherently uninvolving instances of consumer be- havior, the act of acquiring product ownership engages cognitive activity leading to evalu- ative judgments that align self-concept and product image appraisals. Notes 1. See Beggan (1992) for discussion and evidence concerning the likely theoretical mechanisms driving the mere-ownership effect. 2. An additional design element - order of target-item exposure, either first or fourth in a series of products - also was manipulated. Insofar as order effects were absent regarding the focal hypotheses, data analyses are pooled across the order-of-exposure condition. 3. Six participants had values on the Rosenberg (1965) scale equal to the midpoint and were deleted from further analyses; subsequent analyses are therefore based on n = 143. 4. An additional set of items asked subjects to evaluate the key chain on four nine-point scales anchored by good-bad, undesirable-desirable, worthless-worthwhile, and useless-useful. These items tap more into an issue of product functionality than aesthetics (as addressed by the three Likert-scale items). No self- congruity effect was obtained when the four functionality items were averaged into a single measure. This makes sense, a posteriori, because the self-congruity effect involves an alignment between product image and the self-concept, which itself is comprised of broad affective and cognitive considerations about oneself (Markus 1977) that generally would be unrelated to minute matters of product functionality. Hence, in retrospect, it is easy to understand why a self-congruity effect was observed for the aesthetics measure but not for the functionality scale. For space purposes and expositional convenience, we devote no further discussion to the functionality measure. 5. Aside from these two interactions, no other effects emerged.
