<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS. The Psychological Approach to Reality. By FRANCIS AVELING. London! University of London Press, 1929. Pp. ix, 251. lOs. 6d. net. THE title of this book is significant. We are not at Reality but have to get there. We start by knowing nothing but our own mental states and have by some magic to get beyond them to a 'transcendental reality'. Dr. Aveling has a potent spell for his necromancy-the third of Prof. Spearman's 'noegenetic principles '-and so great is his faith in this that he does not allow himself to be dismayed by the failures of his distinguished predecessors to accomplish the same task; indeed, he does not even men- tion them. The problem as he sees it is to give an account of the nature and validity of knowledge, starting from the standpoint of Solipsism. Why start from Solipsism ? Since " the act of knowing is a mental-indeed, an entirely personal and incommunicable-process " (p. 4), the same must be true of what is known, whatever its nature. " To describe a tree growing in the garden, or a watch lying on the table, is as much to describe a mental ob- ject as to describe a feeling or a willing or a mental image is; for in all these cases it is something known (i.e. forming part of knowledge, which is mental) that is described " (p. 20). The term 'knowledge' is here used to cover both 'knowing ' and 'known,' and the reader who admits that 'know- ing ' is a function of mind is lured into the admission that what is known must be equally mental. (It should be noted in passing that in describing and rejecting the popular conception of the distinction between subject and object, the die is weighted by identifying the distinction with that between the mental and the non-mental; thus a willing and a mental image are classed together as equally subjective.) But if to be known is to be mental and to fall within the private existence of the individual self, then Dr. Aveling's question answers itself by the very terms in which it is stated-it is absolutely impossible for the individual to know anything beyond himself and his own states. But closer examination reveals a distinction which, though introduced incidentally, is the key to his whole procedure. It is that between 'mere lived experience ' and ' cognised or known experience ' and is mentioned, as if it were a matter of course, when he is maintaining (p. 20) that the objects known both in introspection, e.g. of a feeling, and in inspection, e.g. of a tree, are equally mental. The real point of his argument seems to be that in both cases what is known is only what is immediately experienced, and that what is immediately ex- perienced must fall within the private existence of the experiencing in- dividual. That this is really his position is clear from the whole tenor of his work. He starts from Prof. Spearman's first two 'noegenetic prin- ciples '. (1) " Any lived experience tends to evoke immediately a knowing of its characters and experiencer ". (2) " The mentally presenting of any two or more characters (simple or complex) tends to evoke immediately</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 503 a knowing of relation between them " (p. 62 n.). These principles, he assumes, express not only a true but a complete account of at least the primary objects of knowledge. The initial assumption is, therefore, solip- sism. Is there any escape from it ? Most of the book is occupied in show- ing that there is none until we take express account of the knowledge which the experiencer has of himself as distinct from his experiences. The most primitive objects consist in what Dr. Aveling rather oddly calls " empirical experience ", i.e. sensations and percepts-Berkeley's im- mediately perceived ideas. This supplies a material from which other objects are reached by various mental operations. Among these he lays chief stress on 'Correlate Eduction' as defined in Spearman's third noe- genetic principle-" The presenting of any character together with any relation tends to evoke immediately a knowing of the correlative character" (p. 63 n.). (Dr. Aveling seems to regard this as an original discovery of Spearman's, and as a satisfactory solution of the epistemological problem, rather than a description of what sometimes happens, which raises in a special form an urgent problem for the philosopher.) But neither correlate eduction nor any other mental process can do more than rearrange and t,ransform the given material. Hence the objects which arise in this way are still only part of the private experience of the individual, " personal and incommunicable ". Dr. Aveling attempts.to show this in detail for ideal principles, such as the law of contradiction, and for space, time and causality. His treatment of causality is specially important for the general argument of the book. He holds, as many others have held, that in our own volun- tary action we have a lived experience of causal efficiency. But he gives a special analysis which he claims to be placed beyond reasonable doubt by experimental evidence. He distinguishes desire and intention on the one hand from conation (or striving) and its resulting action on the other. I desire and intend to move my leg. So far there is no experience of causal efficiency. " The relation of cause and effect is lived " only " when I, wishing to move my leg, strive;' and mv leg moves " (p. 144). Here there are two distinct relations, one between intention and striving, the other between striving and its sequel. Does Dr. Aveling regard both these relations as immediate experiences of causal efficiency, or only one of them ? And if only one, which of them ? He does not seem at all clear on this point; yet it is important. If " intention " is taken to be a separate event radi- cally distinct in its nature from " striving," then what existential relation can be experienced between them except that of temporal sequence ? If there is an experience of cause it must consist in the felt continuity between intention and striving, the intention being continued into the striving in a way which presupposes that the intention is already a nascent striving. In that case Dr.. Aveling's sharp distinction between them is lost. If on the other hand we consider the relation between striving and its sequel, even though we may grant that there is here a causal experience, we must recognise that it does not include or involve invariable or necessary con- nexion. Speaking literally, we do not always hit the nail on the head, however hard we may strive to do so. Striving fails or succeeds in very various ways and degrees according to circumstances. This point is import- ant because of its relevance to the question bow the general notion of cause and effect and the general principle of causality are reached from the ex- perience of causality involved in willing. Dr. Aveling finds the key to his problem in 'correlate eduction '. In other words, there is an analo- gical transference of what we are acquainted with in our ordinary actions</page><page sequence="3">604 NEW BOOKS. to other items of experience. But if the transference is to be successfully made there must be some ground and justification for it. This Dr. Aveling finds in certain characteristics common to other relations and to " the causal relation as we immediately apprehend it in ourselves. Those characteristics are necessity, invariability, immediacy, and the like " (p. 148). But there is no invariable connexion between striving and its sequel. This is no doubt why he here dwells rather on the relation of in- tention to striving. But is striving always preceded by a voluntary de- cision ? And when a falling stone makes a splash in a lake do I ascribe to -it anything analogous to the intention of making a splash ? There are still more serious difficulties. How can we without presupposing the causal relation discover necessity and invariability in the sequence of events ? This was the crucial question raised by Hume and Leibniz; Dr. Aveling has given no answer to it, nor apparently has he realised that -there is a question. The causal experience being, like other experiences, private to the in- dividual, the knowing of it does not of itself take us beyond solipsism. For this we must take it in combination with the unique knowledge which -the thinking and experiencing subject has of itself. It knows itself, accor- ding to Dr. Aveling, as " a fundamentally simple or incomplex existent " ;(p. 195). "It is immediately experienced only as it actually energises " &lt;p. 197), i.e. as knowing, willing, etc.; but since, as Dr. Aveling points out, " these activities cannot be reduced one to the other " (p. 196), he must -take it to be distinct from them, if it is one and the same simple and incomplex self which is experienced in each of its activities. Our know- ledge of it is evidently a direct intuition of it as it is in itself-" a know- ledge of acquaintance with Self as object, not a knowledge abouit it ". " The Self as immediately known in experience is directly apprehended as .a 'that', not as a 'what ' " (p. 196). But if this simple subject is " some- -thing immediately lived and immediately known in experience " (p. 195), -what becomes of the general principle with which he started as evident, that in knowing our own experience we can know nothing beyond it ? If this is not true, the whole of his previous argument is undermined. Dr. Aveling simply asserts that there is an intuition of the kind he describes. He does nothing to meet the difficulties raised, e.g. by Kant in the Para- logisms of Pure Reason. "It is this psychologically absolute and subsistent real, immanent and -transcendental, that allows us to franchise the boundaries of solipsism.... 'The real Self is the epistemological 7roi O-T&amp;) for all Realitv " (p. 210). The transition is effected through the " immediate awareness of the Self as ,causal " (p. 215). But not directly; for why should the self be causal in relation to anything but its own experiences ? Dr. Aveling has therefore to fall back on the contrasted and correlated awareness of the self as passive, e.g. in sensation. Such passivity implies correlative agents. The agents which affect the self cannot be its own experiences, for these experiences are themselves its passive affections. Hence they must be extra-mental realities. * It is admitted that we cannot know what these extra-mental causes are like. All that we can be sure of is " that there exist one or several transcendental realities, as real as we ourselves, which act upon us as causes, just as we ourselves act as causes upon them" (p. 219). This conclusion seems to Dr. Aveling " to be enough for all our purposes "; to others, on the contrary, it may well seem so lame and impotent as to be scarcely worth the trouble which he has taken to reach it. A. K. STOUT.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 505 Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge. By CLARENCE IRVING LEWIS. Charles Scribner's: New York, Chicago, and Boston. Pp. xiv, 511. THIS work may be regarded as a valuable contribution to the systematic 'debunking' (as we say in America) of the intellectualist tradition in philosophy, which is now proceeding apace more or less everywhere. Prof. Lewis won his spurs as a young man by a careful and penetrating study of the various systems of symbolic logic, which revealed that these, together with the mathematical conceptions with which they were associated, were all in ultimate analysis deductions from freely chosen (or ' arbitrary') assumptions (or 'postulates '), of which an indefinite plurality could be formed and which could be varied at pleasure. It thus appeared that their internal coherence had nothing whatever to do with their application to reality and scientific usefulness, and that the 'universal and necessary truth' which had played such a dominant part in the history of thought was simply a confusion, arising out of the conflation of two entirely dis- tinct problems. The use8 of mathematics and logic depended on the empirical fact that from some (more than one) of these mathematical and logical systems could be drawn a (more or less) convenient calculus for predicting the behaviour of empirical reality; but their ' necessity' arose simply out of the conventional meanings assigned to their basic con- ceptions. Thus in themselves they were only word-games, which we might play or not as we liked, though a good sportsman would play them according to the established rules and would refrain from changing them without due notice. Thus all the far-reaching inferences which philo- sophers had been wont to draw from the universality and necessity of mathematics and logic were completely vitiated, and the foundations were laid for a new epistemology, of which the method was radically empirical and voluntaristic. As Prof. Lewis puts it (p. vii), " it has been demonstrated that the certitude of mathematics results from its purely analytic character and its independence of any necessary connection with empirical fact ". But of course such logical revolutions cannot be carried through without inflicting psychological wounds. Most philosopbers had got deeply at- tached to the notionl of the a priori (or at any rate, to the word), and could not bear to part with it. They felt that to strip them of it was to fling them naked and friendless on an alien world. In order therefore to give no needless offence to these weaker brethren, some of the more prudent (or astute) of the innovators have from the first been willing to retain the word a priori-in a new sense. This is what Prof. G. F. Stout did long ago, in bis essay on Error in Personal Idealism (1901), and what Prof. Lewis does in the present volume. In effect he offers a compromise to the tra- dition. He will continue the use of the ' a priori,' if he is allowed to take it as purely the product of an ideal experiment, as a mere matter of definitions and the analysis of concepts. Hence it will follow that there will continue to be quite a number of ' a priori' truths, of assertions that will hold of ' reality' prior to experience. For if any seeming ' reality' should fail to conform to our a priori demands we can always deny it the rank of 'reality'. But beyond this the a priori has no jurisdiction. " The application of any particular concept to particular given experience is hypothetical; the choice of conceptual systems for such application is instrumental or pragmatic, and empirical truth is never more than probable " (p. x). Thus 'a priori' is apt to be an empty honour. Scientific truth is ' synthetic' in Kant's sense, empirical, and merely probable, and even the most 84</page><page sequence="5">506 NEW BOOKS. obstinate determination to withhold the rank of 'reality' from such appear- ances as set a priori expectations at defiance may crumble under the re- lentless pressure of adverse experience, especially as, to accommodate it, we have usually to do nothing more than choose another a priori system. Nor, finally, can the validity of Kant's fundamental problem be con- ceded. " That experience in general is such as to be 6apable of conceptual interpretation, requires no peculiar and metaphysical assumption about the conformity of experience to the mind or its categories; it could not conceivably be otherwise " (p. x). For " a mind such as ours, set down in any chaos that can be conjured up, would proceed to elicit significance by abstraction, analysis, and organisation, to introduce order by conceptual classification and categorial delimitation of the real, and would, through learning from accumulated experience, anticipate the future in ways which increasingly satisfy its practical intent " (p. 391). For this doctrine Prof. Lewis propounds the name ' conceptualistic' pragmatism, which is clumsy, but may serve. He affiliates it especially to C. S. Peirce, whose manuscripts have come into the possession of Har- vard University, and are being increasingly appealed to as a source of esoteric inspiration by its members, although the selections from them so far published hardly justify any very exalted estimate of their value. What- ever its sources, however, Prof. Lewis's pragmatism seems to be unexcep- tionable and of excellent quality. Hence the cavils which follow should be regarded merely as the captious ebullitions of an inveterate critic. Prof. Lewis's remark on page 329 that the conclusion of deductive in- ference is as certain as the premisses seems to require modification in view of the slur cast upon the validity of the syllogism by Sidgwick's ambiguity of the middle, which reduces to probability the certainty of the conclusion in the abstract form. The doctrine (e.g., p. 436) that " every proposition ought to be true or false under all circumstances" affirms an 'ought' which is more easily demanded than effected. It overlooks also the priority of meaning to truth, and the frequent lack of meaning in formal pro- positions. In his anxiety to convince us of the value of probable reason- ing Prof. Lewis seems sometimes to overshoot the mark. He contends that the probable judgment may be valid (in the strict formal sense ?), and if valid true, and if true absolutely true, and if once true always true (pp. 331, 332, 382). But his proof seems a bit sophistical, not to say verbal, like the proof given on page 268 that new and improved "C ategories and concepts " do not ' contradict' such as are antiquated and discarded. Prof. Lewis's explanation is that the better concepts are other than those they supersede, even when they are conveyed by the old names: the old concepts remain as true as ever they were. Aye, but was their 'truth ' ever more than that of a verbally consistent play with de- finitions which have now been found not to apply to the real ? Moreover I am at a loss to render his contention that " empirical and material truth is never more than probable " (p. 307), compatible with the ascription to it of the honorific predicates cited above. Nor can I discover Prof. Lewis's right to declare " given all the relevant data which there are to be known, everything is either certainly true or certainly false " (p. 330). Relevance implies selection and a possibility of dispute; so the notion of " all the rel- evant data " does not seem to go with something so formal as the principle of Excluded Middle. Lastly, I am unable to fathom how a denial of the formal principle of Contradiction or the discovery that " it was merely a verbalism " would entail the consequence that " nothing in experience possesses any stability " (p. 306). Surely on Prof. Lewis's own principles</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 507 the stability of nature would remain precisely what it was whatever postu- lates logicians played with. On the other hand I have nothing but admiration for Prof. Lewis's con- tentions that, " it is the a priori element in Knowledge which is pragmatic, not the empirical " (p. 266), that " the a priori knowledge of universal principles does not secure any a priori knowledge of empirical particulars " (p. 315), that " a generalisation with very few exceptions is almost as good as one with none, as a basis for action " (p. 334), that " memory in general is probable knowledge " (p. 337), and that " in a world in which knowledge, as some have portrayed it, would be valid, intelligence would be unneces- sary, since habit would be a universally safe guide "' (p. 340). May I conclude by suggesting that both the points of coincidence and those of divergence between Prof. Lewis and myself are so marked and important that not only I but also logicians generally will be eager to get from him an expression of opinion on the doctrine of Logic for Use ? It is certainly high time that progressively-minded thinkers should get together and consider in detail just how much of the old formal logic is worth keeping. F. C. S. SCHILLER. A Manual of Psychology. By G. F. STOUT. Fourth Edition; revised, in collaboration with the Author, by C. A. MACE. London: University Tutorial Press, Ltd., 1929. Pp. xx, 680. 12s. 6d. WE all regret that Prof. Stout has not been able to produce by himself the fourth edition of a book that has made such a place for itself in the teaching of psychology; but our regret is tempered with pleasure at the way in which Mr. Mace has performed his ungrateful task. Despite the number of quotations (some well and some badly selected) the Manual has a distinct unity and style of its own; and Mr. Mace has succeeded in making considerable minor alterations without damaging that unity, and in a manner deserving of the highest praise. The principal changes are mentioned by Mr. Mace in his Introduction. The exposition of " the growth of the perception of the external world " has been amplified (by Mr. Stout himself) in the hope of avoiding some misunderstandings. It is no longer assumed that " the simplest datum of sense-perception from which the cognition of an external world can develop consists, not merely in a sensuous presentation, but in a sensuous presentation apprehended as conditioned by something other than itself " (3rd edition, p. 432). Instead the problem is now stated in terms of " original meaning "-" present sensation originally 'means' for the percipient corresponding characters of the physical object " (p. 412). Another innovation is the reference to the Gestalt theorists in the discussion of the perception of form, about which (in the Analytic Psychology) Mr. Stout has, to say the least, thought along similar lines. A point of interest is tle increased emphasis laid in this edition upon the " activity- factor " in perception (and indeed in all mental process): Mr. Stout's assertion that " the perceptual category is always purely and immediately practical in its operation" (p. 422) and theItone of the book generally display what may reasonably be called a pragmatic tendency. The use of the word " presentation " by Stout has been a stumbling- block to those brave students who read him and Ward's Psychological Principles concurrently. Ward used the word in the sense of Locke's "idea "-" nothing but the immediate object of our minds in thinking"</page><page sequence="7">508 NEW BOOKS. (ibid., p. 46). This sense may perhaps be described as metaphysically neutraL Stout in his Analytic Psychology (1896) used it for " a more or less specific modification of the thinker's individual consciousness which defines and determines the direction of thought to this or that special object " (vol. i., p. 47), which is a metaphysically mental sense. The Manual has oscillated between these two usages. The first edition (1898) defines it as " whatever constituent of our total experience at any moment directly determines the nature of the object as it is perceived or thought of at that moment ", which tends towards neutrality, since a constituent of a thing need not share all its characteristics. In the second edition (1901) " presentation " is distinguished from " object " as being a " varying appearance assumed by an object recognised as the same during the process of attending to it " (p. 58), which may be metaphysically anything according to the nature of the " assumption". The third edition (1921) takes it more seriously. The preface states categorically that, as against Ward, " presentation " is the only convenient term to use for " a certain special kind of object, possessing a distinctive character and function of the utmost importance ", and that the use now at last conforms to that of the Analytic Psychology. It is introduced by a distinction between " the states, acts or functions of attending, desiring, liking, willing, believing, etc., and that which is attended to, etc.," the former being called (psycho- logically) " subjective " and the latter " objective " (p. 8). " Presentation" is then defined as an " immediate experience which is primarily objective " (p. 11). In this fourth edition (1929) the distinction between " subjective " and " objective " is repeated (p. 8); but it is no longer followed by an application to " presentations ". Indeed the word has disappeared com- pletely from the book. It is therefore surprising to find Mr. Stout con- fessing in the Preface to his Studies in Philosophy and Psychology (1930) that his use of " presentation " for " that element in the object which is immediately experienced " " has caused so much difficulty and misunder- standing that in the latest edition of my Manual I have fallen back on the use of the term ' presentation' originally proposed by Ward, as correspond- ing to Locke's 'idea ' " (p. x) ! " Presentation " seems to be leaving the philosophical world in a manner as mysterious as its connotation. The singular behaviour of the word in this new edition (as Sherlock Holmes would have described it) is important in its bearing on what Mr. Stout thinks to be the metaphysical status of " sensations ". For however " presentation " is defined, the definition has always been intended to include sensations. And the withdrawal from the use of presentation for something essentially mental suggests a retreat from the position that sensations are mental; and this view is supported by several passages in the book. For example, " sensum " is used throughout the book as a synonym for " sensation ", and the statement that " sensations not only exist for the mind as objects of thought: they also exist in the mind " (3rd edition, p. 209) has been deleted. Instead we are told that we have no right to assume that " they have any intrinsic resemblance to sub- jective experiences, or that they are 'modifications of the mind' or 'states of consciousness ' " (p. 123). Mr. Mace in his Introduction suggests that Mr. Russell would differ from Mr. Stout about the atomicity of sensations rather than about their metaphysical status; and an apology is made for declining to replace " sensation " altogether by " sensum " on the ground that the latter term " is closely associated with the special doctrine that the sensum is the object of a distinctive ' act of sensing,' which in contrast with the sensum is to be described as 'mental'" (p. 10 n.).</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 509 Nevertheless, whether the act of sensing is or is not " distinctive ", Mr. Stout has distinguished at the outset acts from their objects and thus his position is radically different from Mr. Russell's neutral monism. While these psychologically objective sensations continue to be described as " immediate experiences " (instead of, for example, constituents of immediate experience), they must be taken to be mental. Mr. Stout now admits that they are material as well (Studies, p. vii), but is as far as ever from giving a satisfactory reason for their mentality. I will make some final remarks on how the book appears to me as a manual of psychology. In many ways it is admirable: it is so sensible and so rightly emphasised. Yet when I tell my students that it is the best book on psychology, I always wish that there were a better. For the Manual is so unconstructive: it contains hardly any of those generalisations which it is the aim of psychology as a science to discover. Of course this is chiefly the fault of the present state of psychology: there are very few fundamental laws or concepts that are generally accepted, so that introductory books are almost bound to be accounts of rather petty laws (e.g., Woodworth), expositions based on a disputable theory (e.g., McDougall) or philosophical analysis. The Manual is almost entirely this analysis and criticism of naive psychological notions. It is a pro- legomena to a psychology more than a psychology itself. And can the prolegomena be written before there is a science ? If Mach had criticised the notions of force and mass before, instead of two hundred years after, Newton used them so successfully, would mechanics have been strangled in its cradle ? Yet now Mach is clearly right. How much does an infant science require safeguarding from philosophers until its products have begun to make their way in the world ? A little, I suspect. Also Mr. Stout seems to me to be too ready to agree that such and such a subject cannot be treated psychologically. The Manual closes on this defeatist note. " Psychology cannot explain how it is possible that an individual can consciously mean or intend something. . . . Will and thought are not explicable by such categories as causality, substance, resemblance, or correspondence" (p. 654). This comes perilously near to Mr. Joseph's dictum that empirical psychology (" psychology as one of the special sciences ") " can perhaps explain everything that comes to be in the mind, except knowledge and action " (MIND, N.S., voL xxxviii. p. 42). If Mr. Stout attempts to explain perception in spite of Mr. Joseph's conviction that this is impossible, why should not he try to explain will and thought also ? It is the lack of faith of theoretical psychologists in the possibilities of their subject which drives hopeful students into the arms of an " intuitive " Kohler, a bumptious Watson or a coldly fascinatingf Freud. R. B. BRAITHWAITE. The Meaning of Rousseau. By ERNEST HUNTER WRIGHT. Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1929. Pp. vi + 168. 8s. 6d. net. THE author of this book, who is Professor of English in Columbia University, has set out, with considerable success, to complete for Rousseau's writings as a whole the work which such students as Vaughan and Beaulavon have begun for the political treatises-namely, to defend them against the charges of inconsistency so constantly levelled against them, and to account for the widely opposed influences which they have had both on thought and practice. His intention is to trace the main stream of Rousseau's doctrine</page><page sequence="9">510 NEW BOOKS. amid the cross-currents which may always be expected in a writer whose thought develops as he writes; to put in their proper place the mis- leading flashes of paradox which by their very brilliance too often obscure the issue; and to distinguish the different universes of discourse of state- ments which if made with the same reference would be, and have often been taken to be, flatly contradictory. His book consists, therefore, al- most entirely in sympathetic exposition and interpretation, carefully and competently done; but the reader is sometimes left in doubt where the one ends and the other begins, and the references provided to the original texts are too scanty to help him. What criticism there is is of Rousseau's critics rather than of Rousseau. " We are not trying to prove Rousseau right or wrong so much as to say merely what he means " (p. 21). But we are left with the impression that the author thinks him on the whole right rather than wrong. Although Prof. Wright admits that Rousseau invites misinterpretation in the special ways which he points out, he puts the main burden of blame on the critics. It is partly that Rousseau's appeal is so wide that each specialist assumes him to be speaking his own language and dealing with his own problems. " Thus his idea of the natural man, basic as it is for all his thinking, may well mean one thing to the anthropologist who takes this man for the first human being of all time, another to the psychologist who thinks of him as the essential man of any time and yet another to the moralist who may look upon him as the last man still to come and wear the crown of all our culture " (p. 5). But a more important source of misinterpretation and censure has been the pre- judices of the critics against the iconoclast, which have made their criticisms read like political pamphlets. Prof. Wright claims no more than to have read Rousseau over a long period without prejudice; and this book is the fruit of his reading. " Nature is right." In these words he finds the key to Rousseau's thought. In the first chapter he brings together all that Rousseau has to say about what is 'natural' in man and shows in what sense he maintains the natural to be also 'right'; and in the remaining three chapters he discusses in succession Rousseau's view of the education, the society and the religion best suited to develop man's natural goodness, or good ' nature '. The last three chapters are in the main expositions of the Emile, the Social Contract and the Savoyard Vicar's Confession respectively. But the first pieces together fragments of doctrine into a connected whole which " is not to be found intact at -any given place in Rousseau's work " (p. 30). It is in this chapter, therefore, that the failure to give detailed references to the original texts is likely to cause most inconvenience to the scientific student of Rousseau. Yet it is this first chapter which perhaps breaks the newest ground in the interpretation of Rousseau. On the meaning given to the term 'natural' depends, Prof. Wright realises, the whole of Rousseau's argument. Greek thought distinguished between 'natural' as meaning ' primitive ' and as meaning ' what is best for the species '. Rousseau, according to Prof. Wright, combines the two meanings. The natural is the ideal, but " we have no way of finding the ideal for any being without first discovering his native bent and aptitude, without first asking of his nature what his end should be " (p. 21). The natural in the sense of ' primitive ' or ' necessary ' gives the clue to the natural in the sense of the ideal. In man self-love and pity are the primary instinctive elements; from their conflict is born conscience (but Prof. Wright does not help Rousseau to tell us how), and along with conscience, to carry out its dictates, reason develops. All that fosters these natural elements and prevents them</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 511 from degenerating is itself 'natural', however 'artificial' in any other sense of the word it may be. If self-love degenerates into a pride which despises others not as successful as ourselves, then so far we have ceased to be natural and have left the path of development towards the best that we have it in us to be. We must return to nature-that is, " cast away a world of illusion and rediscover our own self " (p. 21). The Emile paints the natural man-" no mere primeval brute, but a man of our own day or rather of a future a1ay " (p. 32)-the Social Contract describes the form of society in which alone such a man may come to be, and the Savoyard Vicar preaches the natural religion, " to which we may all come if we listen only to our sentiment and reason " (p. 32). Prof. Wright is confessedly dealing " with the Rousseau who is still alive in our day " (p. 64) and is therefore justified in omitting " incidental in- consistencies and minor absurdities " (p. 65), but his anxiety to defend his author against unjust attacks sometimes leads him, especially in dealing with the Social Contract, to overlook or minimise more fundamental in- consistencies. For instance, he makes the point that the social contract for Rousseau, embodying as it does the terms on which alone a state worth calling a state can come to be, is not something actually made in the past, but an ideal to be realised in the future; but he does not point out how often Rousseau himself appears to forget this, as when he speaks of the clauses of the contract as " everywhere the same and everywhere tacitly ad- mitted " (C.S. I., vi.), or wheii he introduces the divine law-giver to advise a people who, in Prof. Wright's own words, are " just beginning as a people " (p. 79). (Prof. Wright oddly describes Rousseau's introduction of the law- giver as " a stride into the practical " (p. 80); but even Rousseau himself confesses him to be a miraculous antidote to the blindness of the generalwill.) Again, he rightly warns his reader that in omitting much of the practical application in which Rousseau clothes his principles-his " concrete counsel "-as mainly " truism," and devoting more attention to the principles themselves, he is in danger of giving a misleading idea of the balance of the book (p. 79). But he adds that " the practical detail is inessential. . . . Nothing in [it] will affect the idea of the state " (p. 86). This is not altogether true. Rousseau's practical application of his prin- ciples falls so far short of their promise that there is an apparently irre- concilable discrepancy between what Prof. Wright calls respectively the abstract and concrete sides of the Social Contract. The only obvious way of accounting for it is by assuming that we are apt to make more than Rousseau intended out of the Sovereignty of the General Will, and all that it implies. This discrepancy is noticeable particularly in his account of the relations which are to hold in practice between the sovereign people and the government. In theory the sovereign people is to be the vital principle of the body politic, the source of all law, the initiator of every general policy, while the government is to do no more than particularise and apply their decisions. But when we come to the detailed account of their respective functions we find that of the people represented more and more as being merely to act as a check upon the government, in whose hands apparently lies the all-important task of preparing the business on which the Assembly is to vote. The raison d'etre of the Assembly appears to be in practice to prevent the government from abusing its power. Whether such a body can in any proper sense be called a Legislative Assembly is doubtful; but in any case the account which Rousseau gives of its powers is in striking contrast with the glorification of the Sovereignty of the General Will which forms the main theme of the 'abstract' part of tho</page><page sequence="11">512 NEW BOOKS. treatise. By passing over the practical application Prof. Wright conceals from-himself and from his readers an apparent inconsistency which de- serves at least as close attention as some of those with which he successfully deals. He admits " weakness " in the latter part of the Social Contract (p. 106), but the fact is that there is more than weakness: there is a sur- prising and challenging contradiction, which suggests a review of the accepted implications of the earlier part. Could Rousseau have meant all that he seems to mean by his principles when he so completely fails to apply them ? We should have liked an answer to this question from Prof. Wright. The style in which the book is written may at times prove irritating to some readers. There are, as is natural and right in an American writer, American idioms (e.g. 'back of' for 'behind '). But it has also faults which one would not expect from a student of Rousseau. A rather pre- tentious extravagance of phrasing and a tendency, not always successful, to strain after rhetorical effect, run through the book (to take examples at random, 'exceeding few men' is preferred to 'very few men' (p. 21), 'whether of the twain ' to 'which of the two' (p. 116); and on p. 11 Hobbes appears as 'the sage of Malmesbury '). But these peculiarities are never allowed to obscure the writer's meaning, and he sometimes achieves a pregnant and memorable phrase or metaphor worthy of his author. His book may be recommended not only as an exposition for those who are not closely familiar with Rousseau's writings, but to students of Rousseau as a further bulwark against the tide of criticism which is now at last be- ginning to turn. There is a useful bibliography of the more important works dealing with Rousseau, which might with advantage have been supplemented by a chronological list of Rousseau's own writings and a guide to the most authoritative texts and editions now in print. A. K. STOUT. L'Annie Psychologique. Vingt-neuvigme Anne'e. H. PIEIRON. Paris, Librairie Felix Alcan. Pp. xvi + 946. 120 fr. THis number, like the last, appears in two parts, but the paging is continuous. It contains as usual original memoirs, 'notes', and a bibliographical analysis of psychological literature in all fields. The bibliography itself fills some 700 pages. The volume of psychological literature has become so great that without the aid of some such analysis as that given annually in L'Annee Psychologique no one could hope to keep abreast of the various developments of the science. The original papers are eight in number. They are nearly all experi- mental, and more specialised in their appeal than usual. In the first, entitled " Le probleme des impressions de mouvement consecutif d'ordre visuel ", G. Durup discusses the phenomena of visual after- sensations of movement, and the various explanations which have been suggested. The paper is a very useful summary of the facts and' the theories, without adding much that is new to our knowledge. The author concludes by pointing out that there are two distinct problems involved, the problem of the processes determining after-movement of the field, which are probably muscular, and the problem of the retinal processes in " mouvement consecutif projete ". The article is very long, occupying more than fifty closely printed pages. The second memoir is entitled: " Contribution a l'etude des facteurs</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 513 regissant le taux de sommation des impressions lumineuses de surface inegale". It is by N. Kleitman and H. Pieron, and is in a high degree specialist in character. The question the authors ask themselves is: What is the influence of the surface of excitation on the limen of bright- ness, for chromatic and for achromatic perception, employing white light or monochromatic light of different colours, under conditions of dark or light adaptation, for different retinal regions ? The experiments were carried out with Polack's Perimeter-Photoptometer, ar,d tables and curves showing the results are given. The general finding is that if one leaves out of account the small foveal region, where only cones, each attached to individual neurones, are found, no simple law can be formulated to express the influence of the retinal surface stimulated, because of the heterogeneity of the surface as regards distribution of rods and cones, and connexion with optic fibres. M. Foucault next contributes a memoir on " Les inhibitions interne&amp; de fixation ". The author discusses the various sources of inhibition affecting the memorising of a series of words or syllables. He first dis- tinguishes between "external " and " internal " inhibition. As an example of " external "inhibition may be cited the well-known phenomenon usually spoken of as " retroactive " or " regressive " inhibition, first studied by Muller and Pilzecker. If one learns a series of words just up to the point of immediate reproduction, and then turns at once to the learning of a second series, this second learning exercises an inhibiting influence- " une action d'effacement "-on the associations, etc., established in the first learning. Two other forms of " external " inhibition can be found, the second resulting from carrying on another piece of mental work simul- taneously with the learning-called by Foucault " concomitant " in- hibition-and the third an inhibition exercised by the first piece of learning on the second, which shows itself in an increase of learning time-called by Foucault " progressive external " inhibition. There are also " internal " inhibitions, that is, inhibitions having their source within the series itself which is being learned, and it is mainly these to which Foucault wishes to draw attention. The presence of each new image, as words are learned, exercises an inhibiting influence on the older images. This is analogous to the " regressive " inhibition of Muller, except that it has its origin within the series itself. It may be called " regressive internal " inhibition. There is also a type of inhibition which may be called " progressive internal " inhibition, which, as in the case of the "external " inhibitions, is the converse, as it were, of the " regressive ". Experiments are described which have as their object the isolation and measurement of these two types of internal inhibition. The fourth paper, by Madame Pieron, is devoted to the discussion of a French standardisation of the " Barcelona test ". The test itself-an intelligence test-is not given, which is rather a pity. Altogether 3017 subjects were tested, of whom 2374 were boys, representing primary, secondary and higher schools in France, and 643 girls, similarly representa- tive. Percentile results for all ages from 13 to 21, and for both sexes are given. The 'results show a slight superiority of the boys at most ages. The next three articles deal with kindred problems in different sense departments. All are highly technical and specialist in character. A. Fessard discusses the effect of short tactile stimulation-'" Le probleme des excitations tactiles breves "-H. D. Bouman and P. Kucharski discuss the influence of the duration of sounds upon their timbre-" De l'influence</page><page sequence="13">514 NEW BOOKS. de la duree des sons sur leur timbre "-and H. Pieron studies what may be described as a side problem in his work on sensation time in vision- " Les lois du temps du chroma des sensations lumineuses. La M6thode." All may therefore be said to be concerned with the time factor in sensory experience, the first with the effect on the tactual threshold of shortening the time of stimulation, the second with the conditions under which a change of timbre is produced with notes of different frequencies by short- ening the time during which the stimulus is allowed to act, the third with the evolution of chroma in visual sensations as a function of time with different intensities of stimulation and with reference to the Benham- Fecehner phenomena. All represent merely the beginnings of investigations. The last paper is the only theoretical paper in the volume. Here D. - Bertrand-Barraud discusses the part played by language or verbal images in the definition and organisation of thought-" Le langage et les articulations de la pensee ". The paper is interesting, but cannot be said to contain much that is really new. The author contrasts what he calls " instinctive " thought with reflective thought, taking the first to be characteristic of animals and of -very young children, and goes on to consider the nature of consciousness and the development together in one single movement, as it were, of language and rational thinking. The original memoirs are followed by three 'Notes' by H. Pieron. The first of these is on: " The r6le of the phenomena of contrast in the combination of heterogeneous fields of binocular vision ", the second on: "The influence of the composition of the light on the nature of the Fechner-Benham subjective colours ". The third describes three new pieces of apparatus, a colour mixer in which the sectors can be adjusted during rotation, a simple apparatus for measuring reaction time, called by Pi6ron, the " chronoptoscope ", and a modification of the pursuit pendulum of Miles. JAMES DREvER. Text-book of Logic. By A. WOLF. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1930. Pp. 407. lOs. LOGIC is one of the world's greatest bugbears. It is as 'inexorable' as death. Its ' validity' is as strong as the united strength of all the sciences, because at heart it is 'pure'. It is 'irresistible', 'cogent', and mysterious. Even among philosophers few are fond of reading it and probing into its mysteries. Practically it is a traditional item in the academic curriculum, but only in a very elementary, attenuated and stereotyped form, which the labours of generations have rendered superficially easier than elemen- tary mathematics, and which can be rendered sufficiently entertaining to be tolerated by those who can be amused by playing with words. Conse- quently every professor of logic with a sufficient ctientele is tempted to write a text-book of elementary logic; and their name is legion. The in- terest and value of these productions, however, can best be estimated by observing how far they take into account the extensive and incisive criticism to which Formal Logic has been subjected in recent years, and have been able to utilise it to improve the statement and to modify the assumptions of this venerable discipline. In so far as they fail to do this they are merely handbooks of a pseudo-science which is really nothing but a word-game. Now in his 'jacket' Prof. Wolf claims to have produced something "very different from the usual run of text-books on logic " and " likely to be more helpful to students and teachers ". According to the Preface</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 515 also " logic is here treated consistently and adequately as the study of the main types of reasoning and the general conditions of their validity. All topics not strictly relevant to these problems are omitted. At the same time, many types of reasoning not included in other text-books are dealt with here. Thus the usual obstructions are removed, and the usual de- ficiencies are made good, so as to enable the reader to have a clearer and more comprehensive view of the whole field. Moreover, the exposition of the subject is more systematic and coherent than is usual. Strange though it may appear, text-books of logic are among the chief sinners against the canons of logical method." Clearly Prof. Wolf is determined not to be identified with these black sheep. Among the merits which he claims, however, the most difficult to substantiate is probably consistency. For whereas it used to presentl the appalling appearance of an effective chimaera, with the leonine roar of deductive logic in front, backed up by a solid body of ' inductions', and tailing off into serpentine coils of probability, with a real sting, behind, Formal Logic nowadays usually degenerates into a bleating goat in front, grotesquely grafted on a lion's trunk, with a tail reduced to a vermiform appendix, so that the whole incongruous combination is fit to excite deri- sion rather than apprehension. Prof. Wolf's doctrine also appears to suffer from similar misfits. His recognition of Probability (chap. xxii.) and Circumstantial Evidence (chap. xvi.) is distinctly meritorious, while the seventy-six pages of exercises are a welcome tribute to the practical side of Logic. His account of 'inductive' logic also, while conventional enough to pass muster as reasonably 'orthodox', evinces a competent grasp of scientific method. His version of deductive logic is at any rate brief enough to be excused from plunging into the depths and difficulties which criticism has revealed. But it is in the composition of his,chimmera that discrepancies arise, and his stitches often come undone. Thus in his treatment of 'Induction' he has been wise enough to take the advice given in my Formal Logic, to render its doctrine at least superficially defensible by introducing the notion of relevance into its 'canons,' and he has even added a brief but sound discussion of this notion (pp. 221-222). But this hardly justifies him in forthwith appealing to it elsewhere, as he frequently does (pp. 20, 21, 32, 45, 78, 96, 116, 314, 319). In spite of his admission (p. 222) that " it is impossible to indicate any definite and reliable mark of relevance ", he evidently has not fully grasped how fatal Relevance is to all Formal Logic. Moreover he does not consider the cognate and equally subversive problems of Meaning and Ambiguity, and does not abandon the Formal notion of 'Validity' (v. above) and the pretensions of 'logic' to 'exactness'. Nor is there any mention of Sidgwick's Ambiguity of the middle term and its deadly effects upon the claim to validity of the syllogistic form. Yet there is not a little pragmatism in Prof. Wolf's doctrines. Thus he insists strongly (p. 120) on the need of applying logical formulas to concrete cases. On page 132 he takes identity as similarity sufficient "for practical pur- poses." He repeatedly disclaims the construction of 'fool-proof' procedures. He admits (p. 154) that " Knowledge was born in the service of life; it was, and in many ways still is, an instrument of life," that (p. 275) " there is no finality in human knowledge, not even in scientific knowledge," and that (p. 286) " if science is to avoid every suggestion of anthropomorphism, it must be dumb." Finally (p. 304) the Uniformity of Nature is reduced to a 'hope', partly " the result of a practical drive felt by mankind." (Cf. also chap. i., p. 40 and p. 307 f.). Of course one must confess that</page><page sequence="15">.516 NEW BOOKS. these passages are jostled by others which retain ' intuitions', 'cogency and ' pure disinterested' science, and can only be regarded as relics of rationalism, while the faint pretence that (formal) logic is concerned with judgments rather than with propositions is dropped after chapter ii. Of the notorious 'Laws of Thought' Contradiction and Excluded Middle are- affirmed without discussion, though Identity is passed over. On the whole Prof. Wolf's compromise seems likely to increase the growing doubts as to whether it is prudent for conservative philosophers, to go on teaching Formal Logic. For however artfully they may maintain their conspiracy of silence towards any radical criticism of the Formal tradition, however skilfully they may slur over its incongruities and hush up its failures, it is not really a defensible subject. So soon as it ceases to be treated as a pure word-game and makes the slightest concession to the demands of common sense and science, it is ruined. And the more in- telligent the youthful students of 'logic' the more rapidly will they see through it, and recognise it as a pseudo-science. F. C. S. SCHILLER. The Evolution of Truth and other Essays. By, HOWARD V. KNox, M.A. London: Constable &amp; Co., Ltd., 1930. Pp. viii + 180. 10s. 6d. IN this book Captain Knox has republished eight papers contributed by- him to philosophical journals between the years 1900 and 1920. Their republication in a more convenient form will be welcomed by those who enjoyed them when they first appeared. This procedure, however, has its dangers. In the first place, even philosophical papers are apt to lose their* interest with the passage of time. The present collection, we should immediately add, does not suffer in this respect. We found even the earliest contributions lively enough; partly, we think, because of the pleasant style of the author and, partly, because of the uncompromising stand whicbh Captain Knox makes for his philosophical faith. But, again, one frequently- finds in collections of this kind a tedious repetition of like arguments, es-- pecially if the papers are written on the same theme and from the same point of view; and the present work is not wholly free from this second defect.. At the same time it mav be held that a good argument, like a good story, is fully worthy of repetition. The author, as is well known, is an ardent disciple of William James,. and perhaps no one has claimed as much for James as Captain Knox has done. For instance, at the end of the paper entitled 'The Philosophy of William James' he writes: " After all, James might well be content to rest his title to fame on his having translated the question 'What makes knowledge possible ? ' into the question 'What makes knowledge credible, and conduct possible ?'. That is what in the history of philosophy will be known as James' Answer to Kant, and there are those who believe that it will rank as more epoch-making than Kant's irrelevant Answer to Hume " (p. 114). All these papers preach James' Pragmatism, either by attempting a positive statement of it, or-more frequently-by attacking opposite views. Most of the papers are polemical in character, and it is only occasionally that we find Captain Knox' positive beliefs expounded. The book is fittingly closed with a paper entitled 'Is Determinism Rational ? 9, which contains more positive teaching than most of the earlier papers. The argument of this paper is repeated in Captain Knox' recently published work The Will to be Free, which has already been reviewed in MIND. Of</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 517 the seven papers which remain two deal directly with William James, discussing his philosophy and his letters respectively; *two attack the Absolute Idealism of T. H. Green; the fifth attacks Mr. Bradley; the sixth the heretical Mr. J. B. Pratt, whose book (reviewed here by Captain Knox) " presents a novelty to science in that its author is the first known case of a convert from pragmatism " (p. 82); while the seventh is entitled 'Pragmatism: the Evolution of Truth'. The book is, perhaps, more of a polemic against Absolute Idealism than a positive statement of Pragmatism, and like many another of its kind it sometimes goes to excesses. Here, for instance, is a statement that should have been modified: " Whereas Locke was trying to understand the nature of the human understanding and the way it grew up, it never seems to have occurred to Green that the human understanding was a subject worthy of human study" (p. 118). His point is that Green's interests lay in the determination of the ' spiritual principle ' in knowledge. But surely Green interested himself in this principle simply because of his in- tense desire to explain human knowledge, and to say that Green thought human understanding to be a subject unworthy of human study is directly to contradict the actual facts of the case. The argument of the book is, we think, marred by rather foolish over-statements of which the above is one, but not, unfortunately, the only example. We must complain also of the tendency to identify Rationalism with Absolute Idealism even in the later papers, and to argue as if once Absolute Idealism has been over- thrown Rationalism itself has also been overthrown. This false identi- fication of Rationalism with Absolute Idealism greatly simplifies Captain Knox' problem. If wxe understand his main argument correctly it can be reduced to the following propositions. There exist two schools of thought, the Rationalist and the Pragmatist. Now for the Rationalist the only finally true knowledge is that of the Absolute; consequently if we are to have truth at all it must be the whole Truth. But (on the Idealists' own showing) our finite mind cannot know the whole Truth. Therefore, it follows that we can know nothing with absolute certainty. We must then either say that the finite mind never gains truth or, with the Prag- matists, that 'truth' for us is something relative and not at all absolute. Now Mr. Bradley has already given the Idealist answer to this criticism. Our own objection is that the above argument does not put before us the genuine alternatives. For Absolute Idealism is not the sole type of Rationalism. There are Rationalists who believe the human mind capable of certainty quite apart from any philosophy of the Absolute. The actual fact of the matter is that we are not compelled to choose between Absolute Idealism and Pragmatism. At the same time, Captain Knox might claim that the Idealist School wields far less influence over English thought in 1930 than it did when he set out to attack it in 1900. Yet, if Idealism has been superseded in Eng- land, it can hardly be said that Pragmatism has established itself in its place. The view that the 'true' is what 'works' or, again, what people accept because it best suits their purpose at the time, does not seem to be gaining ground amongst responsible English philosophers. It is so obvious that ' true ' is an adjective we only use when we meet with a certain theo- retical compulsion of a definite kind. The 'true' is what we are compelled to accept, whether knowledge of it be useful or not, and Captain Knox in this book seems to disregard this element of compulsion and necessity. In so far his analysis of the cognitive experience, as also the metaphysic he builds upon it, is surely defective. R. I. AARON.</page><page sequence="17">518 NEW BOOKS. Die Religion in ihrer dogmatischen und ihrer reinen Form. By LEo HAMBURGER. Mtinchen: Reinhardt, 1930. Pp. 170. M. 7.50. IN this solid but somewhat abstract book, Herr Hamburger contrasts two kinds of religion, the " dogmatic " and the " pure ". Occasionally, instead of " dogmatic " he says " historical ". But he scarcely does enough to explain what either dogmatic or historical means. If dogmatic be a description attaching to any religion that makes positive or doctrinal statement,s, about Reality, it might with perfect justice be applied to the pure optimism to which eventually he gives his adherence, for to assert that the world is definitely valuable is as much a doctrine as anything can be. And the term " historical ", as used in discussions of this sort, is radically ambiguous. A religion may be called historical because (like Christianity) it has a vital connexion with certain events believed to have happened, but also because it has played a part in the past of the world. Hinduism is historical in the second sense, not in the first. Hamburger leaves us more than a little uncertain in which sense he is using the word. The three parts of the book treat successively of the essence of religion, the normative laws obtaining between religious thinking and valid knowledge, and the demands which may legitimately be imposed on the "extra-intellectual " element that goes to constitute religious life. A moment ago it was urged that Hamburger leaves the reader in some doubt as to what " dogmatic " means, and this is true of his main argu- ment. There is, however, an early sentence which professes to make things clear but rather adds to confusion. " We call a religion dogmatic ", says the writer, " which in any of its conceptual parts contradicts valid knowledge, we call it pure when its theoretical basis is scientifically trustworthy." But here again, may it not be reasonably held that a religion (like Christianity) may be dogmatic and yet contradict nothing that science has proved, while pure optimism might be denied the certifi- cate of science, and yet, as a faith, be none the worse for that ? After rejecting various suggestions, Hamburger defines religion as an emotional attitude to the world as a whole. He fails to take account of the fact that to show that religion and knowledge are not to be equated still leaves it a very real possibility that knowledge may be a vital element within religion. Besides, the definition just stated makes all argument useless. If religion be, as such, just an emotional attitude to the world, obviously a dogmatic religion is a corrupt form of it. As the argument proceeds, however, it becomes more and more doubtful whether knowledge or belief can be excluded. Even the etxtraordinarily question-begging assertion on page 26 that " dogmatic religion is an emotional attitude to an imaginary world, pure religion to a perfectly real one ", suggests that however pure the religion it is still bound up with belief. Warm praise must be given to those parts of the book which deal with optimism and pessimism. Every religion, it is contended, must hold by one of the two, for it must either find or not find pleasure in the world of experience. Hamburger insists on rejecting transcendence as no fundamental religious idea, and unwisely urges that when Hegel taught the opposite he was guilty of a contradictio in adjecto. Another of his positions is that religion lies beyond the distinction of true and false; but the psychology of this is more than doubtful, for every believer feels the truth of his beliefs to be a matter, for him, of life and death. Later in the argument, the</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS. 519 emotional attitude in which religion is said to consist turns out to be valuation. Das religi6se Gefilhl ist Wertgefiihl (p. 83). A vain attempt is made to exhibit the object of religious emotion as merely immanent, as if pure- immanence and pure transcendence exhausted the field of choice. Weltbezogen is not as such weltlich. There is no more transcendent word in the vocabulary of religious faith than " creation ", yet it manifestly implies a real relation to the world. The kind of ideal religion Hamburger has in view is immanence-philosophy touched with emotion, an attitude from which all impulse to worship has departed. And can this have any real bearing on what religion has actually been and done in human life ? Hamburger's ethical position is very much that of Nietzsche-thr older thinker made consistent, he would say. There is no categorical but only a hypothetical imperative. Werde, der du bist ! This scarcely encourages us to hope that actual religion will be deeply understood, for as S6derblom points out even the primitive tabu-mana system implies the idea of unconditional obligation. Where Hamburger's thoughts on religion seem most awry is in his tend- ency to speak of it as something that man does for himself. Pure optimism is religion at its best, and man is to make himself an optimist by wise, management of his will. The crucial question, we are told, is whether man can produce in himself love of the world (which is the one thing needful) by his own resources. If he can, his triumph is complete. " The religious task of man is the self-production of his fate by will " (p. 156). Anything less calculated to throw light upon the meaning of religion, as distinguished from a high sort of magic or auto-suggestion, could not easily be imagined. Not self-exploitation but the responsive feeling of depen- dence on a power higher than we, is the inward sense of religion. H. R. MACKINTOSH. Principles of Experimental Psychology. By HENRI PIrRoN. Translated by J. B. MINER. International Library of Psychology, etc. Kegan Paul. Pp. viii + 190. 10s. 6d. PIARON's excellent and comprehensive little book, Psychologie Expr.i- mentate, in the " Collection Armand Colin ", is sadly mangled in this trans- lation. Again and again we come across sentences and phrases which are, ambiguous or unintelligible-sometimes pure nonsense-and we are driven back to the original to see what Pieron does say. The trouble begins in the Preface and is continued practically to the last page. In the first paragraph of the Preface the translator writes: " having more especially to do with the human being who interests us in practical life ". The ambiguity disappears when we read in the French: " en ayant plus par- ticulierement egard a l'homme civilise normal, qui, pratiquement, nous interesse davantage ". On page 18 we find the sentence: " Mechanical stimuli (vibrations in particular) and chemical stimuli, the radiations which they set up when they are absorbed, heat or photo-chemical activities, al affect Infusoria as well as man ". What on earth does it mean ? Again Pieron's statement is clear enough: " les stimulations mecaniques (vibrations en particulier) et chimiques, les radiations qui engendrent, quand elles sont absorbees, des actions thermiques ou photo- chimiques, sont efficaces sur les Infusoires comme sur l'homme ". On page 46 the translator tacks on to a paragraph the words " in themselves</page><page sequence="19">520 NEW BOOKS. *to give it its specificity ", which do not seem to have any meaning, and are not represented in the original at all. On page 51 there is a lovely sentence " The puncture among morphine addicts by its painful excitation, is an element which often complicates the toxicomania for the person morbidly afraid of pain ". One cannot help wondering what the translator thought this meant. If it means anything it is more or less the opposite of what Pieron says. The words are: " La piqufre, chez les morphinomanes, par l'excitation douloureuse, est un 6lement qui complique souvent d'algo- philie la toxicomanie ". Let one more sample suffice. On page 80 we -read: " Let us increase the objective intensity of a stimulus, for example, by letting down on the skin of a finger pins held in equilibrium on their -points. For a weight of a milligram any reaction may be recorded by :repeating the excitation a hundred times. Let us admit that for a weight of five milligrams, 25 times in 100 a contact will be acknowledged; for a weight of six milligrams, perception will occur 50 times in 100; for a weight of seven milligrams 75 times in 100; and for a weight of eight milligrams 99 times in 100." No one who had not an independent knowledge of the facts could ever make out what this meant. Pieron's ,own statement is quite straightforward and free from difficulty: "Faisons croitre l'intensite objective d'un stimulus, par exemple en utilisant, pour les deposer sur la peau d'un doigt, en les tenant en equilibre sur leurs points, *des epingles, de plus en plus lourdes; avec un poids deun milligramme, aucune reaction ne peut 8tre obtenue en rep6tant 100 fois l'excitation. Admettons que, pour un poids de cinq milligrammes, 25 fois sur 100 un contact sera accuse, etc." These examples only give one a very faint idea of the vices of the translation. It is throughout very slipshod, and the meaning is frequently -obscure. In fact the translation is incomparably more difficult to under- stand than the original, even for a person who has little more than a smattering of French. It must be admitted that Pieron's French is by no means easy. It is too compressed to be easy. Things can hardly be otherwise when an attempt is made to put so much into so small a book. Nevertheless it is highly unfortunate that the English reader should make Pieron's acquaintance through a translation like the present. It is a pity something cannot be done to prevent this kind of thing happening. Several recent German writers have had similar reason to complain. Why will people attempt translations, whose knowledge of -the language, and possibly also of the subject-matter, is inadequate ? As for the book itself, though it is quite impossible to recommend the translation, the original is an excellent account of the present position in psychology. As we should expect, it is written from the point of view of the experimentalist. Experimental psychology, however, is widely interpreted. Pieron himself is known mainly for his valuable and im- portant work in the field of psychophysics, but here he does not by any means confine himself to that field. All the modern developments of -psychology are discussed from a point of view, which he designates ' experimental ' but which might be more fittingly described as bio- logical or broadly behaviouristic. The first chapter deals with the notion of reaction or response, and the whole framework of the modern science -is, as it were, built on this as a foundation. The treatment is illuminating and original, and the little book as published in the " Collection Armand rColin " can be warmly recommended. In any case without this no one will be able to make head or tail of the translation. JAMES DREVER.</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS. 521 The Book of Diogenes Laertius: Its Spirit and Its Method. By R. HOPE. New York: Columbia University Press, 1930. Pp. xiv, 241. $3.00. THE author explains in his Preface that the aim of his essay is to provide "6 an introduction to the book . . . and an analysis of the thought- pattern underlying its composition." I think he is probably too sanguine in supposing either that such an analysis is adequately accomplished in his own pages, or that it is feasible to execute one with the present data of expert opinion. Before the " pattern " of the work can properly be sub- mitted to analysis at all, we need to be sure that the book known to us as the Lives of the Philosophers really has an underlying pattern, and owes its present form to the controlling mind of a single author or reviser. And this seems to me more than can be asserted with confidence in view of the wide divergence of the critics on every question connected with the immediate sources of the book, and the date and character of its final redaction (if it ever received such a redaction). Thus, to take an illustra- tion of the kind of difficulty to be faced, the life of Plato seems inspired by a marked enthusiasm for Platonism and that of Epicurus by an equal admiration of Epicureanism. May we infer that it is a personal char- acteristic of " Diogenes," whoever he was, that he felt a strong preference for two such unlike philosophers ? Or must we explain away the laudation of Epicurus as ironical, taking the appreciation of Plato at its "face- value " ? Or finally, should we explain the facts by supposing that the praise of Plato and that of Epicurus belong to different original sources which have been flung together by a mechanically working compiler ? Clearly our view of the personality of " Diogenes," his interests and pur- poses, will depend very much on our answer to this critical question, and Mr. Hope's own second chapter is an eloquent proof of the wide range of disagreement on such matters between equally competent scholars. It seems to me, then, that it is premature to attempt the task outlined in Mr. Hope's Preface until the complete text of " Diogenes " has been com- petently edited from the best MSS. with a full apparatus criticus, and a real measure of unanimity reached about his proximate sources and the amount of editing they have undergone in his work as we have it. Mean- while, Mr. Hope's review of the history of the text, and of the controversies of the docti about its sources, in the first two chapters of his essay, has a real value as revealing the intricacy of the critical problems which still await solution. Mr. Hope offers no solutions of his own, whether from modesty, or from a conviction that the opinions of one vir doctissimu-s are neither more nor less likely to be true than those of another. In the remaining four chapters an attempt is made, while leaving the critical problem in abeyance, to draw conclusions from the text as we have it about the preferences of " Diogenes " among philosophers, the aspects of philosophy, and the features of the biographies of philosophers, in which he is most interested, the precise purpose with which his collection has been formed, and the kind of circle of readers it presupposes. Ob- viously, none of these conclusions can be regarded as final until the prior critical problem has been settled. I am not certain that Mr. Hope does not rather overlook this when he presents some of his results as estab- lished by " statistics " about the number of times a given author is quoted or a given topic mentioned in his text. But the amount of labour entailed by the compilation of these statistics must have been great, and they are always suggestive and agreeable. The amassing of them is a piece of industrious work for which students of " biographical doxography " will 35</page><page sequence="21">522 NEW BOOKS. be sincerely thankful. There are occasional things in the book which look like awkward slips in scholarship, like the confusion of Xenophanes with Xenophon on page 181, or the remark at page 132 that " Diogenes " condemns the style of Socrates as unskilful and that of Aeschines as slovenly. (The remark about Socrates really refers, of course, only to his unsuccessful attempt in the prison to versify a fable of Aesop, and the other censure only concerns the apparently spurious alaXoyot d'KiaAot ascribed by some to Aeschines.) Similarly, it is Mr. Hope, not " Diogenes," who ascribes the " discovery of the cube " to Archytas (p. 187). What "Diogenes " speaks of is the discovery of the "duplication of the cube," a very different matter. Some of these slips, like the appearance of such forms as ifratvoi3or6at, or OKparoyoi4Lcove (as nominative) are presumably due to the printer, but one wonders a little that they should have passed the reader of a University Press. A. E. TAYLOR. The Interpretation of Religion: An Introductory Study of Theological Principles. BV JoHN BAILLIE, M.A., D.Litt. Pp. xv, 477. T. &amp; T. Clark, 1929. 14s. net. DR. BAILLIE is a professor of systematic theology in the University of Toronto, and in this substantial book has set himself to provide a very complete and thorough philosophical introduction to theology. There are two parts, the method and the inquiry. In the former, he discusses the scope of theology and its relation to' other studies. In the latter, he reviews theories of the nature of religion, the characteristics of belief, the criterion of religious truth, and the ideas of God and of revelation. This will be recognised as a formidable programme, and it is carried out in a way that leaves little to be desired as to completeness. It is not an arm- chair book, by any means, but Dr. Baillie is not weightier than his purpose demands, and is never obscure at any rate. The author's own conception of religion is set forth in terms of value. It is "; a confident reference of our values to the real order of things ". But this he takes to be too vague to serve for more than a general philosophical characterisation of religion. He therefore seeks to give the grounds of belief, and traces religious certitude to the personality as a whole, not merely to an intellectual conviction. It is not easy to see, however, why Dr. Baillie so strongly objects to calling the religious point of view a hypothesis experimentally verified. He says that the process which confirms it is the same as that which suggests it. Not necessarily so, surely, for belief may be suggested by authority, tradition, or other factors, but ultimately become a conviction based on personal experience. Dr. Baillie calls faith the choice between two alternatives, but since there is no point in speaking of alternatives unless both may conceivably be true, it follows that neither is so evidently right that it excludes the possibility of the other being right. A hypothesis is a statement of possible relationship, and it is difficult to see how choice between alter- native possibilities is different from choice between hypotheses, in such circumstances. The next step is to deal with the idea of God, a chapter which seems to me to fall somewhat below the level of the rest. All is based on a moral argument that is not strongly put, and one imagines would produce little impression on any unconvinced inquirer. The critical and historical</page><page sequence="22">NEW BOOKS 523 portions of the book are stronger than the constructive. In the chapters on God and on revelation, Dr. Baillie falls back on remarks about the history of these doctrines at the moment when it seems necessary to dis- cuss their basis and philosophical validity. A more definite separation of the two aspects would have been an advantage throughout. One is glad, however, to extend a welcome to this book as an honest and candidL attempt to think out and set down the theory of religion. It is odd that. every man seems to think himself capable of expressing opinions worth. listening to on the subject of religion. Hence the number of books written by literary men, scientists, and others, on religion, which an avid public buys, persuaded that the opinions of a distinguished physicist or historian must have weight in this matter, though the last thing they would do would be to take the theologian seriously, if he made excursions into science. To read a book like this, is a needful reminder that a knowledge of the kind requisite for expressing an opinion upon theological questions intelligently, does not come by the light of nature, and one could wish that our amateur theologians would apprentice their minds to these pages, which would provide them at any rate with some conception of the extent of the field into which they make light-hearted excursions, and of the wide historical, psychological and philosophical knowledge required of the modern theologian. E. S. WATERHOUSE. A Study of the Principles of Politics: Being an Essay towards Political Rationalisation. By G. E. G. CATLIN, M.A., Ph.D., Professor of Politics in Cornell University. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin. Pp. 469. 18s. net. THis book is a continuation of a recently published volume entitled The Science, and Method of Politics, in which the aim of Political Science was defined as being to describe, without ethical judgments or presuppositions, and by methods analogous to those of the natural sciences, the acts of men in their quest for power. And its object appears to be the further elaboration of these views of the status and methodology of Political Science (Part I.) and their application to the discussion of some of its major problems (Part II.). Part I. does not add much, and Prof. Catlin would probably not claim that it did, to the arguments of the earlier volume, beyond substituting ' control ' for ' power ' as the chief end of men in their political endeavours, and therefore the chief concern of the ' politicist.' Special efforts are, however, made to show that control can be of many kinds, and in particular that it is not confined to the dominance of men over one another but is also to be found in co-operation between them. And in Chapter III. an interesting critical discussion is offered of the various ' political laws,' in the sense demanded by Prof. Catlin's concep- tion of scientific method, that have been suggested by various thinkers, including one of his own formulation. Part II. is much longer, and presumably more important, covering ground that was not explored in the earlier volume. But, in view of the large scale and elaborate pretensions of the book, it is difficult not to be disappointed with it. It is very loosely connected with Part I., and might indeed have been written in entire independence of the methodology there advocated. ' Political laws ' are not formulated or illustrated, except incidentally; and the only consistent feature of Prof. Catlin's</page><page sequence="23">524 NEW BOOKS. method seems to be the repeated use of a somewhat misleading analogy, already suggested in the earlier volume, between political and economic science. He makes, it is true, some effort to adhere to his intention of describing only what actually happens or is likely to happen; but he cannot altogether avoid passing moral judgments, or in other way strans- cending the somewhat narrow conception of Politics which he has imposed upon himself. Nor are his actual discussions, though based on wide reading and carried out in considerable detail, in themselves satisfactory. Indeed, his wide reading and elaborate attention to detail seem to have made it difficult for him to develop, and certainly do not make it easy for the reader to discover, anything like a coherent or continuous argument, whether in the Part as a whole or in any one of its five long chapters. Chapter VII., for example, on Equality and Status, consists almost wholly of a disconnected series of discussions of the equality of, and possible con- flicts between, different kinds of groups (age groups, sex groups, race groups, interest groups, and groups of various other kinds), and makes little reference to political theory or any other kind of theory, either to support the detailed points which are made about each group, or to suggest a general thesis about all of them. These discussions and similar dis- cussions in other chapters (for example, that about sovereignty and the nation-state in Chap. VIII.) are often interesting enough in themselves; indeed, they constitute the chief merit of the book. But even in them the large number of books which Prof. Catlin appears to have read seems to have been more often than not a disadvantage to him, seducing him into irrelevant or unnecessarily elaborate di~cussions and tempting him to burden his pages with redundant footnotes. There are a number of misprints and other minor inaccuracies, especially in the footnotes, but perhaps no more than might be expected in a book of this character. 0. DE SELINCOURT. Stufen der Personalitdt. By WALTER EHRLICH. Halle, Max Niemeyer, 1930. Pp. 165. M. 8, bound. THIs work contains a number of striking ideas that may prove very helpful in elucidating philosophical problems, though it is to be regretted that the author has not developed them with greater fullness. In my opinion he would have done better either to lengthen the book or to omit altogether some of the points discussed in order to give himself space to set forth the others more adequately, and I certainly feel that the book might have been made much clearer, though this is an accusation that would perhaps be brought, at least by a foreigner, against most recent German philosophers. The work is primarily epistemological, and starts with a classification and distinction of the various possible attitudes to nature (romantic, mythological, etc.), followed by a determined attempt to separate the fact of knowledge from any relation of causality. In the way it is ex- pressed the argument sometimes goes so far as to seem to imply that the state of mind involved in knowledge is not determined by causality in any way, but this is not in fact the author's intention. What he wishes to emphasise, so far as it can be expressed briefly, is that a thing may figure in two different planes, the scientific plane of becoming and causal connection, and the epistemological plane in which, as object of know- ledge, it has a being outside the causal chain, though its entry into the</page><page sequence="24">NEW BOOKS. 525 second plane may be conditioned by an event in the first plane. The relation in knowledge between consciousness and object he maintains to be indefinable, not because it is unknown, but because it cannot be reduced to any other relation, and is in particular totally different from the relation of causality, and he emphasises very strongly the importance of this rela- tion for philosophy. It might be objected that the name which he gives, Zuordnung, is not the most appropriate, and that it is too suggestive of the correspondence theory, but this is perhaps mainly a question of words as the author in practice emphasises the directness of the knowing relation and does not expose himself to the charge of confining the mind to its own ideas. He holds that our view of knowledge is very much distorted because we are so used to the causal view of the world that we have difficulty in thinking at all a relation which is not causal. Dr. Ehrlich then proceeds to discover by analysis of our experience various successive stages of personality. Most elementary and lowest is the purely individual, then comes the inter-subjective, the existence of which is proved by the fact that different men have experiences in common, then a third is revealed in certain higher experiences, but hardly attained by most men. It is to be regretted, however, that the account of the third stage is very difficult to follow. He then works out the distinction between two aspects of man as on the one hand a natural being swayed by desire, and on the other hand a " transcendental " being capable of freedom and knowledge, and distinguishes further grades in our higher experiences. In general the book shows ability and considerable originality, though as regards the latter the claim implied in the first page that the view of knowledge expressed is radically different from any previous one will not hold water. A. C. EwING. Logik der Philosophie, Grundzilge einer Umgestaltung der Formalen Logik. By PROF. DR. ARTHUR LUNEMANN. Braumiiller, Vienna and Leipzig, 1929. Pp. vii, 127. PROF. LPNEMANN, being justly disgusted with the " bloodless and soulless aridity " of the text-books of Formal Logic and the miseries of teaching it, has set himself to compile another which 'will of course completely transform' it (p. 82), and publishes this work by way of Prolegomena. Perusal of it, however, engenders a strong suspicion that it might have been more in place as an epilogue, if, that is, he takes the trouble to explain in his text-book, and to bring within the grasp of the meanest or school-boy intelligence, the series of catch-words which in this book he merely flings about, and leaves his reader to apprehend, if he can. As matters stand his highly technical and obscure discussions take for granted that every one understands what he means by 'Intuitikon' (which strikes one merely as a horrible hybrid), ' Funktionsynthese,' ' Wahrheitsmoglichkeit,' 'Logik der Philosophie,' ' voraussetzungsloser Transzendentalismus,' 'Wesenserfassung,' ' heterologisch,' etc. When he has explained what meanings precisely he wishes to attach to these phrases, it may be possible to consider the value of his arguments, though even then his fondness for the traditional German confusion which is called 'Vorstellung,' his addiction to the demand for ' purity,' his denunciations of 'psychologism ' which like (or unlike) nature perpetually recurs to trouble German logics and is never exorcised, and his habit of dignifying merely verbal ' proposi- tions ' with the title of 'judgment,' do not augur well for the success of</page><page sequence="25">526 NEW BOOKS. his enterprise. But it must be admitted that in the course of his book he develops a very pretty talent for scolding, and exercises it upon all the logicians he knows, including all the German writers of the last fifty years. In view of this it is perhaps fortunate that he has evidently never heard of the systematic psychologism of pragmatist logic; should he ever encounter it, speech would probably fail him altogether! F. C. S. SCHILLER. Histoire de la Philosophie. At BREHTER. Tome II., La Philosophie Moderne, I. le dix-huitigme sie'cle. Paris: F. Alcan, 1929. Pp. 314. 20 fr. ONE is glad to receive a further instalment of M. Brehier's interesting and scholarly history of Philosophy from the earliest times to our own day. It is an excellent feature of the volume that M. Brehier by no means confines himself to the " big men," or to men whom it is traditional to classify as "philosophers ". Pascal, Bayle, Fontenelle, for example, all come by their rights in this very living picture of the currents of thought in the seventeenth century. Naturally enough, the Cartesian succession is dealt with at some length, and M. Brehier has found room to give his countrymen brief, but substantially accurate, information about such par- ticularly English groups as the " Cambridge Platonists " and the " deists ". To myself it is a welcome and long due innovation in a bad tradition that Malebranche is treated not in the account of the successors of Descartes, but independently on his own account, and in the right chronological setting, after Spinoza. I think that, as one would expect in a French historian, Descartes is treated with the maximum of gusto, and after Descartes, perhaps Spinoza; but M. Brehier reveals everywhere a wide and sympathetic study of the whole field. Naturally enough, in so long a narrative, there are incidental slips of chronology and the like, in dealing with non-French thinkers. Thus Milton's Areopagitica was published not " in 1647 after Cromwell's victory " (? Naseby), but in 1644; the " third book " of the Temporis Partus Masculus (mentioned on p. 37) is a work unknown to me, and, I suspect, to every one else; the remarks about " Cabalistic philosophy " alleged to be taken (p. 32) from Bacon's account of the idola tribus really belong to that of the idola theatri. Charles II. was not " restored " in 1651 (p. 144), unless by " restoration " M. Brehier means to allude to the farcical coronation at Scone as " covenanted " King of Scots. The date of publication of Hobbes's de Cive is variously and inaccurately given in different places (the first and the expanded edition being apparently confused). His de Corpore was published not in 1661 (p. 146) but in 1655. The A. in the name of Locke's deistical friend Collins stands not for Arthur (p. 293) but for Anthony. (M. Brehier has confused two contemporaries.) A welcome feature of the volume is the comparative fullness of the bibliographies appended to the different sections. The very excellence of these bibliographies makes the omission both of Joachim's Study of the Ethics, and of Hoffding's Commentary on the work, rather remarkable in the case of Spinoza. I think it a pity also that Kemp Smith's Studies in Cartesian Philosophy and Latta's Monadology of Leibniz receive no mention. But these are small defects in a very deserving book. The dreadful luctifera (for lucifera) on page 36 is, no doubt, a creation of the compositor. A. E. T.</page><page sequence="26">NEW BOOKS. 527 Cattell Group Intelligence Scale: Specimen Set. By R. B. CATTELL. London: G. G. Harrap &amp; Co., Ltd. 3s. 6d. THE Cattell Group Intelligence Tests are divided into three scales, for ages 8-11, 11-15, and 15 upwards. This division is a point in their favour. They are constructed according to five principles, of which the three first and most important are: (a) To include only those types of test already proved to be most highly saturated with g. (b) To expect only a bare minimum of (general) knowledge on the part of the subject as a working basis for the mental operations dealt with by the test. (c) To assume a much more limited vocabulary than has hitherto been demanded in most intelligence tests. The importance of (a) wiRl be recognised by all who are familiar with Prof. Spearman's Nature of Intelligence; (b) and (c) denote an im- provement on most of the well-known American tests. Apart from this, Scales II. and III. include the usual type of question on Analogies, Classification, Completion, Inference, Synonyms and Opposites, and there seems little to say about them except to hint at a suspicion that Tests 1 of Scales II. and III. are almost equally difficult-a suspicion which cannot be verified, as Messrs. Harrap, contrary to their usual generosity, have failed to include the table of norms in their specimen set-and to commend the addition of pictorial analogies and classifications. Scale I. is more tentative, and more interesting. It consists of eleven tests, which, by including the " Ballard " type of question [Absurdities, Orientation, Puzzles (4), (5), (8); Riddles (10), which seem entirely new; and Picture Completion (11)], make a more varied, less fatiguing test than usual for the very young. The items of the various tests are on the whole well-chosen, but ambiguities are present in certain of them, e.g., Test 4 (6) (a good case can be made out for either answer), Test 9 (5) (meaning of " just "), Test 10 (6) ('I do not come down from the sky' can be taken to mean ' I stay up in the sky '). In Test 8, items (7) and (8) are clearly in favour of those children who by the age of 11 have learnt a little elementary Algebra. Test 3 is confusing: the examples given are not true samples of the items. The child is liable to be troubled by the dotted spaces, and to waste his time in trying to fill them mentally before answering. The only general criticism to be made is against the time element. If there is a time limit at all, it should only be in questions so long that no competitor can hope to reach the end, and it should not be mentioned on the test itself. To tell a child that he has 3j minutes in which to do a test is apt to lead to his completing it in about a third of that time, often to the obvious detriment of his answers. A reviewer of American tests must view with suspicion any addition to the two or three dozen standardised tests on the market, very few of which seem any better than any other. A reviewer of English tests has not this apparently unnecessary reduplication to contend with. Dr. Ballard alone has produced a series of tests comparable in range with the Cattell Tests. Only time can show whether the latter rival in accuracy of prognosis Ballard's Columnbian, Chelsea, and Crichton Tests. D. M.</page><page sequence="27">528 NEW BOOKS. Received also E.
