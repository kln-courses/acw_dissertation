These new forms of reimbursement no longer guarantee health care providers unlimited payments based on the num- ber or cost of services the provider chooses to render. Instead, they fix The following acronyms are used throughout the article: AMA: American Medical Association. AHA: American Hospital Association. DHHS: Department of Health &amp; Human Services.

Health care institutions are at the vanguard of this revolution in reimbursement policy. The new programs are directed at hospitals, HMOs, and other organizations rather than at individual physicians. This fact presents an extraordinary anomaly. Physicians, not institu- tions, control the vast bulk of health care expenditures. Doctors deter- mine when, how long, how intensively, and in what environment to treat patients. They order the laboratory tests, x-rays, pharmaceuticals, and surgery that determine the short-term institutional costs of treat- ment and that ultimately create the long-term demand for capital re- sources and insurance coverage.3 Although difficult to quantify with precision, informed estimates place 70 to 90 percent of health care ex- penditures within the control of individual practitioners.4 In order for health care cost containment to succeed, then, it is necessary for those institutions that employ, retain, or house doctors to implement new managerial control techniques that alter treatment be- havior. Effective institutional control strategies, however, are unlikely to fit well within a legal structure that has evolved under a traditional, unrestrained reimbursement environment in which physician interests and authority have predominated. This Article evaluates the legal controversies that institutional con- trol of physician behavior will generate. Informed by recent works of economists, sociologists, management scientists, and organizational the- orists, this analysis will reveal many hidden truths about the legal in- frastructure that shapes relationships within the health care sector. Ul- timately, we will learn that current cost containment programs are fundamentally at odds with the professional libertarian values of physi- cian autonomy that are embedded in the law to preserve the practi- tioner's independence from the institution. 8 See Saltman &amp; Young, The Hospital Power Equilibrium: An Alternative View of the Cost Containment Dilemma, 6 J.

The Revolution in Health Care Financing For decades, medical treatment has been dominated by the Hippo- cratic ideal that all care should be provided that is of any conceivable benefit, regardless of the cost,5 which is an absurd ethic in a world of limited resources. In the mid 1980s, however, aggressive new public and private initiatives began to show dramatic potential for reining in previously unharnessed health care inflation.6 For the first time in a generation, health care registered single-digit inflation in 1984 and claimed a diminished portion of the GNP.7 Hospital sector perform- ance was particularly impressive, with expenditures growing only 6.1 percent over 1983 levels, the slowest rate of increase in 19 years.8 Fur- thermore, in 1984 hospital lengths of stay plummeted 21 percent from 1983 levels,9 and occupancy rates dropped to their lowest level since the American Hospital Association began collecting such data.'? This startling improvement resulted from a number of radical new cost-sensitizing reimbursement policies adopted by federal, state, and private payers. In 1983, the federal government instituted what has 6 See R.

This payment system is referred to as "prospective" because the amount is objectively set in advance of treatment rather than determined after the fact by the hospital's choice of treatment.13 Consequently, prospective payment creates a profit/ risk-based incentive for hospitals to economize. States are also implementing increasingly rigorous controls on health care expenditures, both public and private. Some have enacted "all payer" systems that apply DRGs or other forms of prospective payment to all hospital patients.14 A greater number of states have be- gun to use health maintenance organizations ("HMOs") for financing and delivering health care under their Medicaid programs.5l HMOs offer comprehensive medical coverage for a fixed annual fee per en- rollee, a method of prospective payment known as capitation.

HMO growth in number and membership is even more rapid in the private sector.l6 This surge in HMO popularity is due in part to the increasing vigilance of private industry in demanding restraint in employee health insurance premium increases. Private sector cost con- sciousness has also fostered active experimentation with other alterna- tive delivery systems. In response to the demands of insurance compa- nies and self-insured employers that health care providers accept limited payment,17 hospitals and physician groups are developing a va- riety of delivery systems to meet the new competitive pressures.18 These three developments in prospective payment-DRGs, HMOs, and alternative delivery systems resulting from federal, state, 16 See ProPAC, supra note 14, at 87 ("[HMOs are] becoming available to a broader segment of the population. Forty-three states now host the headquarters of at least one HMO."); Taylor &amp; Kagay, The HMO Report Card: A Closer Look, HEALTH AFF., Spring 1986, at 81-82 ("The number of HMOs and their members have grown rapidly and continuously during the last several years."); Wall St. J., Oct. 6, 1987, at 1, col. 1 ("In the past five years the number of [HMOs] has nearly tripled . . .and so has the number of people they cover, to about 28 million."); N.Y.

See Lis- sovoy, Rice, Gabel &amp; Gelzer, Preferred Provider Organizations One Year Later, 24 INQUIRY 127 (1987); Schwartz, The Preferred Provider Organization as an Alterna- tive Delivery System, 6 J.

Times, Oct. 13, 1987, at Al, col. 6. Other innovative structures that are still at an experimental or developmental stage include Primary Care Networks ("PCNs"), Exclusive Provider Organizations ("EPOs"), and HMO "wraparounds." See, e.g., Easterbrook, supra note 2, at 67 (not- ing that Primary Care Networks "combin[e] the best elements of fixed-fee and pass- along payment. ... PCN doctors are paid on a pass-along basis but get only 80 percent of their fee up-front. The balance goes in to a reserve for specialists and hospi- tal admissions. At year-end any money remaining is split between the physicians"); Traska, Plan Designs Change to Fit Choice and Cost, HOSPITALS, Jan. 20, 1988, at 36 ("Two newer products are exclusive provider organizations (EPOs) and open-ended HMOs, sometimes known as HMO wraparounds. . . . EPOs operate on a discount basis but use a restricted group of providers, as do HMOs. . . . Open-ended HMOs allow members to seek care from non-plan physicians but provide only partial reim- bursement if a member receives care outside the plan."). Almost 60 percent of privately insured Americans are now in "managed care" plans, defined as HMOs, PPOs, or fee-for-service plans with prospective review of hospital stays. See AM. MED.

The revolutionary impact of switching from open to closed- ended reimbursement can be expressed in a number of ways.'9 Primar- ily, new payment methods are prospective rather than retrospective, set- ting the amount of reimbursement in advance of treatment rather than measuring costs or charges afterwards. By removing provider control over the amount of reimbursement, prospective payment attempts to replicate competitive market conditions in which all suppliers are "price takers."20 This objectification of payment is a common thread running throughout the variety of reimbursement innovations, which too often are discussed as disparate phenomena. B. The Physician/Institution Dichotomy in Prospective Payment A singular fact characterizes the various forms of prospective pay- ment: each is aimed at health care institutions rather than at physi- cians.2' The DRG payment system applies only to hospitals, while Medicare continues to pay physicians on a fee-for-service basis. Capi- tated systems are organized around entities that represent groups of physicians who as individuals are compensated internally on different terms. Alternative delivery systems similarly are typified by innovation in institutional design rather than in the method of payment to solo practitioners.22 19 (1) Services and departments that previously were revenue centers because they generated additional reimbursement are now cost centers because they diminish the profit margin. (2) Rather than searching for a competitive edge only by enhancing the quality of care, providers must now also engage in cost competition. (3) The new ethic in medicine to replace "do everything that can be done," is "good value for the health care dollar." (4) The metaphor that fit the past reimbursement structure was allowing the fox to guard the hen house because those who profited from treatment made the treatment decisions. Now, the proper analogy is to the shot-gun wedding: hospitals and physicians are forced to live together despite their fundamentally opposed financial incentives. 20 See Hall, supra note 13, at 418-21 (discussing payment and profit/risk incen- tives in a prospective system). This is accomplished in greater or lesser degrees by different forms of prospective reimbursement. Capitation systems leave providers essen- tially no control over the amount of payment. DRG payments allow providers to deter- mine only whether or not the patient needs hospitalization. Fee schedules control the amount charged for each unit of service but leave providers free to determine the inten- sity of treatment. 21 See Relman, Cost Control, Doctors' Ethics, and Patient Care, 1 ISSUES ScI. &amp; TECH. 103, 108 (1985). 22 See, e.g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332 (1982) (discussing an alternative health plan, organized by county medical societies, in which participating physicians agreed to accept pre-set schedule of fees as payment in full, to be subjected to utilization review, and to use a consolidated claims processing service, but in which physicians were still paid on a fee-for-service basis. The Court found the plan violated the Sherman Antitrust Act).</page><page sequence="9">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 439 Given the physicians' central role in medicine, why has public and private reimbursement policy not targeted them more directly? There are a number of persuasive reasons. First, institutions are more effi- ciently regulated than individual doctors. Physician fees account for less than a quarter of health care costs.28 The institution, therefore, is the more obvious, and less politically controversial target. The pooling that results from addressing payment schemes to institutions reduces admin- istrative costs and spreads the risks associated with variations in patient health status over a larger patient base.24 Second, it is extremely difficult to design effective regulatory con- trols for physicians. Institutional charges are more easily regulated be- cause their more quantifiable cost base allows the setting of industry- wide averages. For physicians, the dominant cost input is the largely subjective value of professional time.26 Additionally, defining the unit of payment in a prospective system is more manageable for institutions. Currently, the tremendous difficulty in designing DRGs that ade- quately fit the way in which physicians manage cases26 is slowing pro- gress toward extending Medicare reform to all providers.27 Most pro- posals to include physicians within the DRG system would continue to allocate their fees to an institutional group-either to the hospital or to 23 See Wing, supra note 6, at 629. 24 See Ginsburg &amp; Hackbarth, Alternative Delivery Systems and Medicare, HEALTH AFF., Spring 1986, at 6, 16 ("Per case payment for physicians, like per case payment for hospitals, would depend on high-cost and low-cost cases averaging out for any given provider. For costs to average out, a provider must have a large volume and broad array of patients, and that may pose a problem for physicians."); Ropel, Perspec- tives on Physician-Payment Reform, 319 NEW ENG. J. MED. 865, 865 (1988) ("[W]hereas hospitals can average their gains and losses under a prospective payment system across many cases, physicians' smaller caseloads and greater specialization make such averaging much more risky for them."); Sisk, McMenamin, Ruby &amp; Smith, An Analysis of Methods to Reform Medicare Payment for Physician Services, 24 INQUIRY 36, 42 (1987) ("[U]nlike a hospital, which can spread financial risk over many pa- tients, individual physicians who are paid for packages of service would be likely to bear a great deal of financial risk for severe or complex cases that require extensive services."). 25 Hospital DRG rates illustrate the problems encountered in reimbursing labor costs through prospective payment. Labor is the one cost input that DRGs do not at- tempt to control; DRG rates are factored to account for differences in local prevailing wage rates. See 42 C.F.R. ? 412.639(a) (1987). 26 See Jencks &amp; Dobson, Strategies for Reforming Medicare's Physician Pay- ments, 312 NEW ENG. J.

Only within the internal organization of the hospital are such fine-tuning devices likely to be practicable."29 In separating medical institutions from their constituent physi- cians, I am not making a technical ontological distinction based merely on the choice of a corporate form of doing business. Physicians are not the alter egos of hospitals. Doctors have carefully insulated themselves from the financial and managerial concerns of health care delivery, leaving to the lay charitable and investment community the task of cre- ating the institutions necessary to develop and maintain the physician workplace.30 As a result of this fundamental division between the prac- titioner and the medical institution,31 reimbursement policy aimed at institutions does not automatically affect physicians. Direct intervention is required to pass institutional efficiency incentives on to those who actually determine costs.82 28 See Capron, Containing Health Care Costs: Ethical and Legal Implications of Changes in the Methods of Paying Physicians, 36 CASE W.

"' The foundational nature of the hospital/doctor division is reflected in the paral- lel reimbursement structure that pervades private and public health care funding. Medicare, for instance, pays separately for institutional and physician services even when patients are hospitalized. Payment of physician services is mandated in 42 U.S.C. ?? 1395d-1395j (1982 &amp; Supp. IV 1986) (Part A), and provision for institutional ser- vices is at id. ?? 1395j-1395w (Part B). For Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the name itself reflects the same division of fees. Blue Cross pays hospital expenses, while Blue Shield covers physician's and surgeon's fees. See HEALTH INSURANCE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, 1986-1987 SOURCE BOOK OF HEALTH INSURANCE DATA 84 (1987). 32 The need for institutional control can be seen in the legislative history for Medicare DRGs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services' Report to Congress, on which the DRG legislation was based, recognized that "the ability of a hospital to respond to prospective payment incentives depends on the ability of the hospital admin- istrator to transmit these incentives to the attending physician staff."

Implicit support for the notion of institutional control is equally strong. Inherent in the design of DRGs is their potential for monitoring the performance of physicians. A central theme in the DRG literature is that the reimbursement system constrains the hospitals, and the hospitals will then seek to alter the behavior of their affiliated physicians. What is more, DRGs were designed to provide information about practice patterns that administrators would need to have in order to influence physician behavior.

I believe they can learn to control excessive utilization . . ."). The reports of published trials do not support this belief in the effectiveness of physician education and surveillance. While there are many reports of successful educa- tional efforts, these studies are plagued by methodological flaws that preclude much optimism about general reliance on education as an effective control strategy. See Eisen- berg &amp; Williams, supra note 4, at 2197; see also J. EISENBERG, DOCTORS' DECISIONS AND THE COST OF MEDICAL CARE 111 (1986) (noting that previous studies of the effectiveness of educational programs were not performed in controlled environments). The most disappointing flaw is the failure to monitor the long term impact of initially successful efforts to see if the effect persists. When such monitoring is done, we learn that when the intervention ceases, doctors quickly give up the ground that was gained. See Sherman, Surveillance Effects on Community Physician Test Ordering, 22 MED. CARE 80, 82 (1984). Rather than instructing physicians on general principles of conservative treatment, institutions might offer specific feedback to individual physicians about their actual per- formance. Physician feedback has become "quite common" under Medicare DRG re- imbursement through the management technique known as "physician profiling." 1 Quality of Care Under Medicare's Prospective Payment System: Hearings before the Senate Special Comm. on Aging, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 330 (1985) (staff report of United States Senate Special Committee on Aging) [hereinafter "Quality of Care Hear- ings"]. There is no hard evidence of how strong a motivator these techniques will be. Past studies of physician feedback have produced mixed results.

Those who contend that strong measures are not necessary point to the dramatic drop in hospital utili- zation that coincided with DRG implementation as evidence of physi- cians' willingness to cooperate with hospitals.35 However, there are strong signs that the honeymoon is ending. In- itial physician cooperation was prompted by the uncertainty of how hospitals would fare under DRGs and the fear that their bankruptcy or financial distress would adversely impact physicians' practice environ- ment.36 But, far from losing money, the hospital industry has profited handsomely under prospective payment. In fact, it has experienced its most successful years ever.37 When physicians realize their livelihood is necessary to inquire how long the effects persist after the intervention ceases. Most studies do not address this point. On balance, the conclusions of the more carefully designed studies are pessimistic or only cautiously optimistic about the potential for surveillance producing the type of reorientation in physicians' attitudes that is needed to reverse the forces fueling health care cost inflation.

With a sharp increase in medical school graduates and the proliferation of alternative practitioners, physicians' monopoly power is waning. The battle against hospital access by osteopaths has been lost and ground is slipping against physiologists, chiropractors, and midwives. See Nelson, Report Predicts Hard Times Ahead, HOSPITALS, May 5, 1987, at 84, 84. Governmental policy has catapulted HMOs into prominence and infused consumer interests into Blue Cross/ Blue Shield governance. See 42 U.S.C. ? 300e to 300e-17 (1982) (HMO Act). The profession seems to be losing governance even over its own internal affairs. A strong campaign by the Federal Trade Commission resulted in a remarkable 1979 in- junction preventing the AMA from imposing ethical restraints on a broad array of activity relating to the economics of medical practice. In re The American Medical Ass'n, 94 F.T.C. 701 (1979). This ruling directly resulted in the AMA's 1980 refor- mulation of its Code of Ethics. 35 See Barry, Medical Staff Bylaws: Protecting Hospitals' Financial Viability, HEALTHCARE FIN. MGMT.

We have just witnessed a startling round of health insurance premium in- creases ranging from 10 to 70 percent,39 spurred by 1985 and 1986 increases in health care costs much greater than the rate of inflation.40 Despite the initial encouraging success of the new reimbursement pro- grams, "the overall rate of increase in health care spending has not been slowed significantly by recent cost-containment initiatives."41 Following this moderation in the success of cost containment, gov- ernment and private programs have become more vigilant in tightening the reimbursement screws. Hospital patient revenue margins are quickly approaching zero, and the HMO industry is also experiencing Year of the Prospective Payment System, [1987 Transfer Binder] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) 1 36,066 (Feb. 25, 1987); N.Y.

Id. at 400. Ultimately "the dominant group within a particular conflictive equilibrium will adjust its permanent strategy to absorb new initiatives into the existing power arrange- ment. In the case of the hospital power equilibrium, therefore, the physician's control over . . . the hospital's production process may well still generate sufficient resources to enable physicians to deflect any efforts to relax their decision-making grip." Id. at 410. The experience in New Jersey, the country's first DRG reimbursement system, con- firms this speculation. See Hsiao, Sapolosky, Dunn &amp; Weiner, supra note 32, at 41. 39 See N.Y.

Further rounds of reimburse- ment cutbacks will create mounting pressure on institutions to limit services while physicians will continue to assert their independence. Cost containment pressures will not relent until physicians have undergone a revolutionary change in behavior. The mentality of our medical establishment has produced protocols such as the "sixth stool guaiac," a sequential testing procedure for colon cancer that, upon the sixth iteration, detects only three cases per one million patients tested, at a marginal cost of $47 million (1975 dollars) per case.43 In other words, the cause of health care's financial woes is marginally produc- tive, not unproductive, care.44 To repeat a test six times in order to remove a three-in-one million uncertainty is not strictly unnecessary, but it is clearly wasteful. Even the elimination of all such extravagant care would produce only a limited, one-time savings of perhaps 20 to 30 percent. Although admirable, this trimming of fat off the top of the system would do noth- ing about the underlying base of inflation that is estimated at seven percent annually.45 To reach this built-in inflationary base and sustain 42 See Perrone, Hospital Revenue Margins Fall, AM.

In a system with a single-minded orientation toward "spare-no-expense" medicine, this will require a thoroughgoing change in practice styles and medical phi- losophy. Such a reorientation cannot begin to occur without a powerful influence on physician behavior.47 2. Institutional Control and Physician Dominance The slow erosion of physician dominance is consistent with the long history of professional autonomy and sovereignty that medical sociologists such as Eliot Freidson and Paul Starr have revealed.48 For decades, physicians have enjoyed essentially unfettered control over both medical practice and its workplace. Physicians gained control of access to medical practice at the turn of the century through licensing mented within just the past few years include skin grafts, organ transplants, artificial organs, and genetic engineering.

A.M.A. 2047, 2208 (1983). 47 If medical institutions are not allowed this control, they will be forced to coopt the legislation by exerting political pressure to seek its repeal or soften its impact. See Hsaio, Sapolsky, Dunn &amp; Weiner, supra note 32, at 40. More threatening than pro- gram failure is the prospect that new financial pressures will be shunted off in counter- productive ways. "[T]here will be nothing but the ravages of excess demand unless the cost-minimizing incentive is transferred directly to the doctor part of the organization."

ECON. 467, 481 (1977); see also Harris, supra note 29, at 88 ("If these institutional changes are not forthcoming, cost controls may produce only long queues, litigation, cream skimming, and bad medi- cal care.") 48 Freidson's pioneering work in the 1970s focused on physician dominance of the treatment relationship. See generally E. FREIDSON, PROFESSIONAL DOMINANCE (1970); E. FREIDSON, supra note 30.

Of the variety of insurance structures that might have taken shape, the predominant model, indemnity, was one that neither intervened in doctors' relationships with patients and hos- pitals nor interfered with their style of practice.51 The Great Society programs of the 1960s reflect the continuing institutional accommoda- tion of physician interests. Cowed by fears of physician and hospital boycotts, lawmakers encumbered Medicare and Medicaid with a num- ber of structural elements patterned on the prevailing private insurance model. The dominating protectionist influence is codified in the pro- gram's first words, which guarantee freedom from "any supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided."52 Physician dominance has also manifested itself through the defeat of public programs that threaten professional interests. The AMA has had astounding lobbying and boycotting successes against national health insurance, prepayment plans, and a number of other social wel- fare and private financing programs that threatened doctors' economic security and professional sovereignty.53 In short, "[o]ur entire health 49 See S.

See P. STARR, supra note 30, at 375-76. The American experience is not unique. In his classic study of world wide systems of physician remuneration, William Glaser found that "[m]ost payment systems in pub- lic care schemes are simply those inherited from prior practice, . . . more bureaucra- tized versions of the methods that were used and often even invented by the doctors under earlier private practice."

The proponents, how- ever, ignore the organizational realities."). Thus, for instance, although the AMA is prevented from asserting the ethical impropriety of fee splitting, corporate practice, or restricted choice of physicians, doctors are not prevented from invoking legal challenges to these same activities. See American Medical Ass'n v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 638 F.2d 443, 452 (2d Cir. 1980) (holding that AMA was enjoined from imposing ethical restraints on the contract practices of physicians), affd per curiam, 455 U.S. 676 (1982). 66 P.

The law reinforces physician autonomy in a number of ways other than those explored in this Article. (1) The medical malpractice standard of care defers to professional rules of conduct. Physicians have "'the privilege, which is usually em- phatically denied to other groups, of setting their own legal standards of conduct merely by adopting their own practices.' " E. FREIDSON, supra note 55, at 105 (quoting W. PROSSER, HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF TORTS 165 (4th ed. 1971)); see also Havighurst, The Changing Locus of Decision Making in the Health Care Sector, 11 J. HEALTH POL. POL'Y &amp; L. 697, 707 (1986) ("[T]he effect of the [customary practice rule] has been to give the medical profession the power to prescribe . . . its own standards.") (2) Physicians may refuse to treat any patient, even in emergency situations, and even when the individuals are former patients and are able to pay for the services. See Hurley v.

The existing legal literature on health care cost containment misses the mark because it takes this institutional control as a given. It addresses the ethical and malpractice implications of cost containment, asking whether reductions in the quality or quantity of care produced by the new reimbursement systems are consistent with and may be ac- commodated by the existing legal and ethical duties of physicians.58 This body of scholarship is necessarily premised on the assumption that cost containment efforts will change physician behavior in a significant manner. The extent to which this assumption is true is a critical ques- tion of a priori importance that determines whether ethical and liability concerns will ever manifest themselves on a widespread basis.59 Close assessment of the legal doctrines that inhibit institutional control is required to determine whether a strong degree of professional autonomy is necessary to ensure the quality of health care, or perhaps, by stressing quality to the exclusion of other important considerations (3) Medicare's maintenance of the convention of separate billing rein- forces the traditional division of hospitals into two lines of authority, which implicitly preserves institutional noninterference as a protected value. See Havighurst, supra, at 704. (4) Professional corporation laws allow professionals to enjoy the tax advantages of corporate existence without any threat to the autonomy of their individual practices. See E. FREIDSON, supra note 55, at 125-28. (5) Regulatory programs also defer to physicians.

Therefore, this Article evalu- ates the feasibility and legality of management techniques that have the potential for convincing physicians to withhold at least some care previ- ously considered necessary. In so doing, the Article does not attempt to design the optimal system of cost containment; a complete, normative evaluation would be inconceivably extensive and theoretically impossi- ble. It is only possible here to determine in general terms the proper locus and structure of decisionmaking within the existing prospective payment systems. Accepting the premise of contemporary reimburse- ment policy that some reduction in the quantity and quality of care is required, this Article explores how reductions might be accomplished, not how far they should go. Hospitals, HMOs, and other health care institutions might re- spond to cost containment pressures by: (1) dictating the details of treatment, (2) motivating physicians with financial incentives to prac- tice more conservatively, or (3) restructuring their relationship with the medical staff to subordinate physicians to institutional constraints. Di- recting treatment runs afoul of laws prohibiting various forms of inter- ference with the practice of medicine.6? Sharing the profits generated from treatment reductions violates a recent federal statute6s and may constitute prohibited fee splitting.62 Restructuring hospitals is inhibited by laws requiring an open, independent, and self-governing medical staff.63 The task at hand is to evaluate these laws against the dual de- mands of sound medical practice and cost containment policy. II. INTERFERENCE WITH THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE A. Ordering Physician Behavior The most direct method for reducing health care costs is to issue specific treatment instructions or restrictions. Traditional medicine has employed treatment protocols to some extent, but their coverage has been sporadic and their use has been more as a cautionary device than as a mechanism for enforcing rigorous cost control.64 Recently, how- 60 See infra notes 71-170 and accompanying text. 61 See 42 U.S.C. ? 1320a to 7a(b) (West Supp. 1988); inJfa notes 207-11 and accompanying text. 62 See infra notes 171-260 and accompanying text. 63 See infra notes 263-380 and accompanying text. 64 Examples include: (1) Hospital pharmacy "formularies" used to determine when and how long expensive antibiotics can be prescribed.

Health care institutions are now issuing "rigid protocols or standards of care" with increasing frequency, covering a broader range of activity,65 often as binding directives.66 In an unscientific AMA survey,67 two-thirds of the responding doctors reported hospital attempts to decrease length of stay or the number of medical procedures and diagnostic tests pre- scribed.68 New York City pediatric clinics have implemented a comput- erized treatment protocol system that establishes mandatory "uniform diagnosis and treatment procedures . . .for 85% of pediatric ill- nesses."69 The Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association recently issued a lengthy set of guidelines for ordering the fifteen most common diagnos- tic procedures.70 drugs.

Eliot Freidson, a pioneering medical sociologist, dis- covered in a study of an HMO that "any effort at arbitrary quota- setting was resisted almost automatically by virtually everyone because it constituted an attack on freedom of judgment and practice."72 Physi- cians are well-armed in this resistance. Overt control of physician be- havior implicates one of two legal doctrines, depending on the source and form of control. If a health care institution run by lay investors, directors, or administrators attempts to impose control through admin- istrative restrictions and treatment protocols, it risks engaging in the unlicensed practice of medicine.73 If treatment is ordered instead by su- pervising physicians, or if control is imposed through financial influ- 5, 1988, at 24, 25. Various administrative regulations present less obtrusive ways of implementing treatment controls. Hospitals are revising laboratory test ordering forms to reflect the proper indications, intervals, sequencing and duration for testing. See Wong &amp; Lincoln, Ready! Fire!. .. Aim!: An Inquiry into Laboratory Test Ordering, 250 J. A.M.A. 2510, 2512 (1983) (describing authors' success at changing ordering forms for thyroid function tests from a simple check-off list to a "problem-oriented format" that requires the ordering physician to be more discriminating about the particular test ordered). There are four different thyroid function tests, each with a different purpose. With the check-off list, 80 percent of physicians ordered the complete panel of thyroid tests, es- sentially out of force of habit. See id. at 2510-11. Rather than attempting to determine in advance precisely which test was needed, they investigated the tests' meaning only if one showed an abnormal result. The revised form decreased substantially the number of complete panels ordered. See id. at 2511. Another innovative technique is limiting the total number of tests per day that a physician can order, leaving to the physicians' discretion how best to allocate the re- stricted testing opportunities.

B. Lay Treatment Directives and the Unlicensed Practice of Medicine Courts frequently state that "a licensed physician may not accept directions and instructions in diagnosing and treating ailments from a corporation or an individual who is not a licensed practitioner."57 In the words of one commentator, "any administrator who routinely pro- posed to dictate such daily details as which patient should receive how many chest x-rays or laboratory studies, who needs invasive monitor- ing, or who can be safely discharged, would be practicing medicine in the physician's stead."76 To some extent, legal antipathy to detailed treatment standards is warranted. Command and control techniques raise a host of troubling concerns. At the most extreme, American medicine might follow the reported experience in the Soviet Union, where "the bureaucratic man- agement of medical services . . . permits [the regime] to control and manipulate the dispensation of medical and allied services in about the same manner it controls .. .the production of tractors or the construc- tion of industrial plants."77 Physician resistance to such coercive regula- 74 See infra notes 126-51 and accompanying text. 7 Iterman v.

A hospital might set general limits, subject to exception, on the length of stay, the number of diagnostic tests and pro- cedures, or the quantity of medications for particular conditions. Less intrusively, a hospital may simply inform physicians about these sug- gested guidelines. In short, it is not enough to observe that medical li- censure proscribes lay personnel from practicing medicine; it is neces- sary to determine precisely which actions fall within the scope of this proscription. 1. The Definition of Medical Practice The starting point for this analysis is the physician licensing laws' all-encompassing definition of medical practice as diagnosing, treating, or prescribing for any physicial or mental condition.79 Case law inter- preting these statutes for the most part addresses exotic peripheral min- istrations that range from the sublime to the absurd.80 While the terms and unknowns that surround [medical] work....

These examples indicate how far courts are willing to go in supporting the medi- cal profession's desire to protect its domain. Equally revealing are examples of unli- censed practice challenges that have failed. Showing how far the profession is willing to go in attacking peripheral activities under the unauthorized practice prohibition demon- strates the breadth of the prohibition's potential chilling effect.

Merely suggesting a course of treatment may fall within the literal concepts of diagnosis and prescription, but the statute may contemplate something more than kibitzing in order to trigger its criminal sanctions. It is help- ful, then, to distinguish two degrees of involvement: (1) general direc- tives subject to exception in particular cases, and (2) detailed, binding directives specific to each patient. 2. General, Nonbinding Directives Many institutional medical directives are largely advisory. For in- stance, some hospitals prohibit routine chest X-rays at admission unless the physician finds that her patient presents a history or indication of respiratory disease.8' Such general directives, subject to exception in particular cases, should not be considered the practice of medicine. They pose no risk of either delivering incompetent medical care or de- ceiving the patient about the practitioner's qualifications, the two harms protected by medical licensure.82 A medical institution might de- vise various ways to influence a physician's judgment, including lay ad- vice, but these controls do not threaten substandard care or mislead the patient as to who ultimately determines treatment if the decision to comply with or deviate from guidelines ultimately lies with the pa- tient's attending physician. Even the profession's own ethical norms do not proscribe supervision so long as it takes the form of advice.83 Al- though general medical directives go beyond mere advice by setting a mandatory baseline from which doctors must affirmatively justify deviation, setting broad parameters within which physicians must act does little to confine their essential clinical prerogative.

Medical practice requires a specific relationship be- tween physician and patient; it is not performed in the abstract. The terms "diagnose, treat, or prescribe" each contemplate concrete actions with tangible effects on the patient. Advising a physician lacks this im- mediacy and finality because the attending physician retains responsi- bility for the final treatment decision. Therefore, general, nonbinding advice to physicians cannot form the basis for an unlicensed practice claim, even though a lay person may be making a medical judgment. Unfortunately, there is no directly relevant case law against which to test this analysis.85 An encouraging analogous line of authority, though, is the series of cases upholding the right of nonlawyers to au- thor legal books, forms, and kits. Discussion of general legal doctrine in the abstract fails to result in the formation of an attorney-client rela- tionship because it is not directed toward particular individuals with concrete legal problems. Consequently, such advice falls outside the proscription of the unlicensed practice of law.86 If legal advice that is not directed to a specific individual falls outside the definition of legal practice, the same should be true for medical treatment protocols. Legal 84 See generally Blois, Clinical Judgment and Computers, 303 NEW ENG. J. MED. 192, 192-96 (1980) (analyzing the unquantifiable aspects of clinical judgment that prevent establishing precise standards for medical diagnosis). 85 In State v. Abortion Information Agency, 37 A.D.2d 142, 330 N.Y.S.2d 927 (1971), affd, 30 N.Y.2d 779, 285 N.E.2d 317, 334 N.Y.S.2d 174 (1972), the court enjoined the operation of a lay-owned abortion clinic because, among other reasons, the clinic employees "engage[d] in diagnosing a human or physical condition" by "in- form[ing] the prospective patient as to the type of operation for which [she] qualified." Id. at 145, 330 N.Y.S.2d at 929. Under the court's analysis, merely giving advice re- garding a course of treatment qualifies as practicing medicine. However, a critical ele- ment distinguishes this case so as to prevent its application here: the advice was ren- dered to patients, not physicians. 86 The leading decision is New York County Lawyers Ass'n v. Dacey, 28 A.D.2d 161, 173-74, 283 N.Y.S.2d 984, 997-999 (Stevens, J. dissenting), adopted at 21 N.Y.2d 694, 287 N.Y.S.2d 422, 234 N.E.2d 459 (1967): It cannot be claimed that the publication of a legal text which purports to say what the law is amounts to legal practice .... . . .There is no personal contract or relationship with a particular individual. . . . This is the essential of legal practice-the representation and the advising of a particular person in a particular situation.

Purely advisory guidelines directed to physi- cians, therefore, certainly should pass muster. Even if institutional treatment directives pass through to patients by circumscribing to some extent the range of physicians' discretion, they are valid under the legal text precedent so long as they are not specific to the circumstances of individual patients. This reasoning allows medical institutions considerable room for designing programs to constrain physicians' treatment decisions. If a hospital or HMO promulgates general regulations based on scientific studies or clinical research findings, requiring physicians to take ac- count of the regulations does not constitute the practice of medicine. The institution has "no personal contract or relationship with a partic- ular individual."87 There are, however, two defects in this analysis. First, the publica- tion of legal texts triggers greater first amendment protections than pri- vate directives within a medical institution. This constitutional weight may tip the scales in favor of protecting lay activity only when publica- tion is involved. Second, there is some doubt whether the courts have followed the legal text precedent in the medical context.88 Ultimately, then, we are left with no meaningful guidance on the medical practice act's application to general institutional guidelines. This indeterminacy is unfortunate. Cost containment is doomed if these criminal provisions forestall even recommending a cost effective course of treatment.

The court held that this book, which advocated the correction of pancreatic enzyme deficiency as a cure for cancer, "is a diagnosis, treatment, and offer of treatment and therefore constitutes the practice of medicine." Id. at 544-45. In another case, a Delaware court ruled that a nonphysician's public lectures on the therapeutic use of color waves "would constitute a violation [of the medical practice act] . . . though no particular person was singled out and given that recommendation or advice."

The Delaware decision merely reported the jury instructions, unaccompanied by any critical analysis. Kelley involved much more than the publication of a medical text. The author had suggested to the public that he was a physician, which is an independent violation of the medical practice act, and the book was being "used as an illegal tool to aid and abet the unlawful practice of medicine in which actual doctor-patient relationships [were] being formed."

Detailed, Binding Directives It remains to be seen whether a lay administrator might go further and issue particularized and binding treatment directives. Such direc- tives are inconsistent with the purposes of medical licensure. By remov- ing final treatment authority from the physician, these directives entrust high-risk judgment to untrained personnel. Of greater concern is the patient's lack of notice of this behind-the-scenes puppeteering. Mislead- ing patients as to the true decisionmaker's qualifications strikes at the core of medical licensure's purpose.89 Approached conceptually, the binding nature of administrative orders in effect places the administra- tor in a direct treatment relationship with a particular individual. The attending physician's authority does not break the chain of command leading to the patient, as with non-binding directives. Still, a lack of direct precedent90 forces us to consult cases from another context for confirmation of this analysis. Hospital malpractice liability cases have had occasion to grapple with the extent of an insti- tution's control over medical decisionmaking. Early cases held that hos- pitals were only responsible for accidents caused by administrative, not medical, actions. This limitation was premised on the reasoning that "a licensed physician may not accept directions and instructions in diag- nosing and treating ailments from . . . an individual who is not a li- censed practitioner.""' Modern cases reject this older law. They recognize direct corpo- rate responsibility for the quality of medical treatment within hospi- 89 See supra note 82 and accompanying text. 90 Strachan v. John F. Kennedy Memorial Hosp., 209 N.J. Super. 300, 507 A.2d 718 (App. Div. 1986) provided strong support for this analysis. There, the intermediate appellate court relied on the medical practice act in rejecting the contention that a hospital was liable for the emotional distress caused by a delay in declaring the death of the plaintiffs' brain-dead son and turning off life support: "The hospital administrator is not a physician. He is a business person. A hospital administrator has no right to tell a physician how to practice medicine. . . . The law does not impose upon a hospital administrator a duty to establish a procedure to tell physicians how to practice medicine." Id. at 317, 507 A.2d at 726-27. The New Jersey Supreme Court did not comment on the appellate court's logic when it reversed on other grounds, finding in- stead that the patient's physician had declared brain death several days before life sup- port was removed and the delay was caused by the hospital administrator's interference.

App. 1987) (holding that the doctrine of respondeat superior is applicable in the context of medical malpractice).</page><page sequence="28">458 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 tals.92 Perhaps, then, the limitation on hospital control has been over- thrown by a new regime. Prominent scholars contend that coupled with a hospital's new obligation for medical outcomes is a new authority to supervise and control the quality of medical treatment.93 Likewise, in this newly emerging era of institutional responsibility for cost contain- ment, the medical institution might contend that it should have new powers to limit the excesses of medical practice, even at the expense of invading the domain of medical judgment. The two seminal cases that expanded hospital liability seem, on first reading, to support the argument that hospitals are now free to impose stringent controls on doctors. Language in both decisions rejects the notion that hospitals do not practice medicine. According to Bing v. Thunig, the leading case holding hospitals vicariously liable for the negligence of medical employees, "[t]he conception that the hospital does not undertake to treat the patient ... no longer reflects the fact."94 However, to the extent that this language suggests direct institutional authority over treatment decisions, it is misleading. The previous theo- retical difficulty with extending vicarious liability to professional em- ployees was that respondeat superior is premised on the ability to con- trol the actions of employees whereas hospitals are prohibited by law from exercising such control over medical professionals.95 The Bing court's resolution of this conflict was not to recognize the right of con- trol; instead it reasoned that the lack of control is irrelevant.96 By im- posing vicarious liability despite the lack of control, Bing is more cor- rectly viewed as reaffirming the limits of institutional authority.

It has been credited with the next quantum leap in hospital liability-recognizing direct (as opposed to merely vicarious) corporate responsibility for the supervision of care rendered in the institution, even by independent physicians.98 The court reached this result despite the hospital's objec- tion that hospital control of physician behavior constitutes the unautho- rized practice of medicine." Darling is the most influential hospital law opinion of the last 50 years. Its rejection of the unauthorized prac- tice argument surely opens the way for hospital control of physician behavior. But how wide is the opening? Darling is a very cryptic decision whose full import is found only in its progeny. Subsequent decisions eliminate any implication that lay administrators may dictate medical practice. Darling's direct institutional responsibility for patient care en- compasses only an obligation to exercise care in the selection of physi- cians and to take some corrective action when deficient practice is de- tected.100 This is nothing more than what early decisions had long recognized, even those decisions that were most adament about hospital immunity.101 Even this limited institutional oversight is not the exclu- sive purview of management but is heavily influenced by physician participation.102 98 Hardy, When Doctrines Collide: Corporate Negligence and Respondeat Supe- rior When Hospital Employees Fail to Speak Up, 61 TUL. L. REV. 85, 92-93 (1986). 99 The hospital contended that "only an individual properly educated and li- censed, and not a corporation, may practice medicine.. Accordingly, a hospital is powerless under the law to forbid or command any act by a physician or surgeon in the practice of his profession." Darling, 211 N.E.2d at 256. The court rejected this argu- ment, deciding that the hospital could be held liable because it "failed to review Dr. Alexander's work or require a consultation." Id. at 258.

Society of New York Hosp., 211 N.Y. 125, 129, 105 N.E. 92, 93 (1917) (holding that a hospital is not liable even for the negligence of its employed nurses but may be held liable if due care not taken in selecting its physicians). 102 AMA &amp; AHA, THE REPORT OF THE JOINT TASK FORCE ON HOSPITAL- MEDICAL STAFF RELATIONSHIPS 29-33 (1985) [hereinafter AMA/AHA JOINT TASK FORCE]. Indeed, in the view of many, the hospital has effectively delegated so much of the authority back to the medical staff that the institution retains essentially no control. See Weiss v.

Despite the courts' overwhelming acceptance of the concept of direct institutional responsibility for patient care, they have resisted essentially any expan- sion of institutional authority. Health care organizations thus enter the new era of institutional responsibility for cost containment with strictly limited authority to di- rect the details of treatment. Due to the explicit statutory restrictions of the broadly worded medical practice acts, any management technique that approaches binding instructions from lay administrators in partic- ular cases will likely be found to constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine. Although nonbinding advice or general guidelines should be permissible so long as they preserve a core of professional discretion, even this is not free from doubt under the expansive interpretation given the sweeping medical practice prohibitions. C. Tortious Interference with the PhysicianlPatient Relationship Analysis of institutional control as the unauthorized practice of medicine is somewhat misdirected. That doctrine is concerned with the relationship between practitioners and patients; the focus of the present inquiry is the relationship between practitioners and institutions. Only when administrative directives are case-specific and binding do they transfer directly to the patient and thereby place the institution in the position of a practitioner. This, however, presupposes a somewhat im- probable and unrealistic state of affairs. Treatment protocols are rarely developed or supervised by lay administrators and they are rarely bind- ing in an absolute sense. More typically, institutions (1) place the con- trol function with physicians rather than with lay administrators and (2) use treatment guidelines merely as conditions on voluntary financial benefits. The first of these approaches avoids the unlicensed aspect of binding treatment directives while the second potentially avoids the co- ercive aspect. Nevertheless, these two refinements raise new analytical and practical concerns that relate to interference with the practice of medicine. The independence of medical judgment that is at the heart of the unauthorized practice doctrine can be invaded in ways other than those prohibited by the medical practice act. Medical judgment can be delegate clinical evaluation responsibilities to the medical staff. Since the board is com- posed primarily of lay members of the community, it lacks the capacity to police the clinical aspects of a physician's practice."). 103 See supra text accompanying note 93.</page><page sequence="31">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 461 invaded from inside as well as from outside the profession and by influ- ence as well as by compulsion. A more flexible legal tool for addressing these larger interference concerns is the doctrine of tortious interfer- ence. Development of that doctrine will reveal that the law thoroughly protects the purity of medical decisionmaking. It potentially restricts any form of non-medical influence from interfering with the clinical autonomy of individual physicians. 1. The Limits of Unlicensed Practice a. Physician Control of Physicians: Group Versus Individual Autonomy Placing the control function in the hands of doctors by employing supervisory physicians to issue treatment directives is an attractive solu- tion to the institution/physician conflict inherent in current cost con- tainment programs. Several thoughtful commentators advocate wide- spread adoption of peer review techniques04 and preliminary research findings support their optimism.'05 Physicians are more qualified than lay administrators to direct the performance of medical tasks. Addition- ally, their expertise commands more respect. Under the direction of the institution, physician managers can be expected to pursue efficiency objectives more rigorously than the independent, practicing medical staff. Thus, physician administrators are expected to play a rapidly growing role under prospective payment.106 104 See, e.g., Morreim, The MD and the DRG, 15 HASTINGS CENTER REP., June 1985, at 36-38 (advocating "collectively revising protocols"); Omenn &amp; Conrad, supra note 65, at 1315 ("The medical staff as a group might devise a set of cost-related treatment standards, monitor their peers, and then identify and act on variances from those standards."); Young &amp; Saltman, Medical Practice, Case Mix &amp; Cost Contain- ment, 247 J. A.M.A. 801, 804 (1982) (arguing that "each hospital's medical staff, as a group, would be responsible both for establishing a schedule of cost-related treatment standards for their institution, then for actively monitoring their peers to ensure a suffi- cient level of compliance"). lo" See Becker, Shortell &amp; Neuhauser, Management Practices and Hospital Length of Stay, 17 INQUIRY 318, 329 (1980) (noting that efficiency is enhanced when administrators have increased knowledge of internal operations and when there is an increase in structure and rules guiding the behavior of individual physicians). 106 See Sloan v. Metropolitan Health Council, 516 N.E.2d 1104, 1109 (Ind. App. 1987) (describing HMO in which "staff physicians were under the control of the medi- cal director, a physician, who policed medical services and established policy. His judg- ment was final."). The experience in New Jersey, the first health care system to insti- tute prospective payment under a DRG system, verifies the appeal of physician administrators. It has witnessed a "dramatic increase in the number of full-time, sala- ried medical directors and chiefs of service." Vladeck, supra note 32, at 585; see also M. ROEMER &amp; J. FRIEDMAN, supra note 30, at 299 (the future prospects for physician managers are "bright"); Kindig &amp; Lastiri, Administrative Medicine: A New Medical Specialty? HEALTH AFF., Winter 1986, at 146, 155 ("There is every indication that the</page><page sequence="32">462 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 Physician control of physicians offers an escape from the unli- censed practice of medicine prohibition. The unlicensed practice doc- trine is aimed at preserving professional sovereignty over practice at a group rather than an individual level. It is satisfied so long as freedom from lay interference is assured.'07 It does not address individual physi- cians' freedom from control within the profession. Thus, an institution that sets general efficiency policies and guidelines, leaving to physician managers the particular treatment directives, is not engaged in the practice of medicine. So long as the supervising physician's discretion is not controlled by the institution, no unlicensed person makes a medical decision.108 The lack of controversy is demonstrated by the virtual si- lence of the case law and academic commentary on the question of phy- sician control of physicians. Nevertheless, this proposal remains troubling. Simply replacing the institution with its physician representative as the agent for impos- ing cost-sensitive treatment protocols does little to lessen interference with medical practice or to eliminate concern over medical judgment being influenced by non-medical factors. Medical decisions would still be made by someone other than the patient's physician, displacing the actual treating physician's judgment. The patient's nominal treating physician would be reduced to a conduit for treatment directives from the supervising physician and for clinical information from the patient. As a result, the supervising physician would be "practicing medicine in the [attending] physician's stead."'09 Medical peer review is premised on physician responsiveness to professional rather than lay supervision. However, physicians prize both their individual and their group autonomy."? Eliot Freidson's pi- number of physicians involved in administration will increase in the future."); Weiner, Maxwell, Sapolsky, Dunn &amp; Hsiao, supra note 32, at 478 ("New Jersey hospitals increasingly found that it was useful to create or expand the position of chief of the medical staff to interpret their concerns about length of stay to attending physicians in a legitimate professional manner."). 107 See supra notes 81-83 and accompanying text. 108 Likewise, under the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, see infra notes 282-309 and accompanying text, although physicians are employed, they are not em- ployed as treating physicians, only as administrators. This limited employment is in keeping with the traditional industry practice of hiring medical directors. The policies against corporate practice are not implicated because of the minimal intrusion in medi- cal affairs. See Sloan, 516 N.E.2d at 1109 (respondeat superior liability is not avoided by corporate practice concerns at an HMO where the "employee-physician was super- vised by a physician, not a layperson"). 109 Morreim, supra note 46, at 267. Among other issues that this displacement raises is whether the patient is aware of and has consented to the supervising physi- cian's involvement. Full development of this informed consent question, however, is beyond the scope of the present analysis. 11 "Professional autonomy is based on the belief that the qualified practitioners</page><page sequence="33">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 463 oneering work has documented the gripping control of the professional rules of etiquette that govern the medical collegium. The strongest of these rules is preservation of clinical autonomy, the freedom to follow individual judgment without constraint, short of "blatant or gross defi- ciencies."1"' Thus, the importance of individual autonomy to profes- sional interests is equal to the sanctity of group autonomy.112 If previ- ous experience serves as a reliable guide, we can expect that the law will protect individual autonomy as well. Yet, to prevent control from within the profession, physicians will need to search for law other than that contained in medical practice acts. b. Institutional Inducement: Lay Influence Versus Command Medical institutions could also avoid unlicensed practice of law by exerting control through inducement rather than command. When in- surance companies refuse to pay for medical treatment they consider unnecessary, we do not think of them as dictating to physicians how to practice medicine."13 These third-party payors are merely setting limits on what treatment they are willing to reimburse. Medical institutions might also structure utilization review programs to impose economic are best able to determine how the function ought to be performed, and that each prac- titioner must be free to exercise his own judgment in the specific case." W. KORN- HAUSER, SCIENTISTS IN INDUSTRY 1 (1962). 1 E. FREIDSON, supra note 72, at 241. 112 It might be expected that supervising physicians would also honor this highly prized clinical autonomy ethic. Two studies of physician groups revealed that, when physicians are given institutional authority over clinical decisions, they are not inclined to exercise this managerial prerogative as binding authority. Mary Goss found that physician supervisors were not prepared to give anything resembling an order to another doctor concerning the care of that doctor's patient .... Observation of interaction among doctors in the medical clinic . . . revealed no instance in which a supervising physician officially requested a physician on the staff to follow a particular course of action in the care he gave his patient. Goss, supra note 72, at 46. According to Eliot Freidson, these organizations exper- ienced the neutralization of formal authority. "[M]uch of the formal authority . . . was neutralized by the reluctance of its holders to employ it and ... by the unwillingness of the working physicians to grant it legitimacy." E. FREIDSON, supra note 72, at 105. Even advice was "resented" as an unsolicited invasion of clinical autonomy. See id. at 118. However, these studies were conducted in a era that was not sensitive to the need for institutional oversight of costs. It is possible that physician administrators will be more responsive to institutional pressure in a cost-constrained environment where the organization's existence may be at stake. 113 See, e.g., F.T.C. v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 465 (1986) (up- holding Comission's rejection of the argument that an insurance company's use of x- rays to judge the medical necessity for dental claims "would constitute unauthorized practice of dentistry by the insurance company and its employees").</page><page sequence="34">464 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 sanctions for excessive treatment."4 If the only sanction for noncompli- ance with a lay treatment directive is withholding a voluntary economic benefit, it is difficult to find the compulsion necessary for unlicensed practice. Indeed, it is already common for HMOs to require their phy- sicians to obtain prior approval for hospitalization, specialist referral, or expensive diagnostic procedures such as CAT scans.115 The primary sanction for noncompliance is the HMO's refusal to pay for unap- proved treatment. This ultimately leaves to the physician's and patient's choice whether to accept the HMO'S judgment of medical necessity.l6 Directly supporting this position are several federal decisions re- lating to Medicare and Medicaid that explicitly hold that it is permissi- ble "to place appropriate limits on [reimbursement for] medical services 'based on such criteria as medical necessity.' "117 The leading discussion of this issue is found in Association of American Physicians and Sur- 114 The institution could withhold an efficiency bonus or, at the extreme, could terminate the physician's access to its facilities. Further analysis of the latter sanction is contained infra at notes 315-58 and accompanying text. 115 See, e.g., Grant v. Travelers Ins. Co., 343 Pa. Super. 310, 312 n.2, 494 A.2d 862, 863 n.2 (1985). 116 Cf. Wickline v. State, 192 Cal. App. 3d 1630, 239 Cal. Rptr. 810 (1986) in which the court refused to accept a denial of reimbursement from California's Medi- caid program (called "Medi-Cal") in defense of a physician's premature discharge of the plaintiff: The decision to discharge is . . . the responsibility of the patient's own treating doctor. .. .[T]he physician who complies without protest with the limita- tions imposed by a third party payor, when his medical judgment dictates otherwise, cannot avoid his ultimate responsibility for his patient's care. ... [W]hile Medi-Cal played a part in the scenario before us in that it was the resource for the funds to pay for the treatment sought, . . Medi-Cal did not override the medical judgment of Wickline's treating physicians at the time of her discharge. Id. at 1645-46, 239 Cal. Rptr. at 819; see also Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1009- 10 (1982) (arguing that for purposes of constitutional analysis, Medicaid denial of re- imbursement for unnecessary services does not make a state responsible for a physi- cian's decision to discharge a patient). 117 Medical Soc'y v.

Doe, 432 U.S. 438 (1977), with respect to a Pennsylvania Medicaid requirement that the patient receive two confirming opinions for funding of "medically necessary" abortions.

Parham, 625 F.2d 1150 (5th Cir. 1980), the court held that a state's categorical exclusion of sex change operations from Medicaid coverage was not an illegal interference with the attending physician's professional judgment concerning appropriate treatment. Rather, it was a permissible exercise of the state's broad discretion to tailor the definition of "medically necessary" to fit the re- quirements of its Medicaid program. Id. at 1155-56; see also Cowan v. Myers, 187 Cal. App. 3d 968, 978, 232 Cal. Rptr. 299, 305 (1986) (state may properly decide what services are necessary, leaving physicians to determine what treatment is necessary). Finally, a series of decisions under the Medicare provision prohibiting federal "su- pervision or control over the practice of medicine," 42 U.S.C. ? 1395 (1982), is instruc- tive. See College of Am. Pathologists v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 859, 868 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (limitation of pathologist reimbursement does not constitute unlawful interference); Home Health Care, Inc. v. Heckler, 717 F.2d 587, 590-91 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (policing reasonableness of costs does not constitute interference with practice of medicine); American Medical Ass'n v. Mathews, 429 F. Supp. 1179, 1201-03 (N.D. Ill. 1977) (restrictions on reimbursement for expensive drugs do not constitute "supervision and control"). However, these decisions are not directly applicable to state unauthorized practice law. The PSRO case was decided under a constitutional attack and therefore may be more permissive than state law. Similarly, the Wickline case addressed tort liability for treatment decisions and the Rush case was decided under an analysis of the Medicaid statute's requirements for covered services.</page><page sequence="36">466 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 There are several unsettling aspects to this reasoning, however. First, it echoes theories rejected in constitutional due process jurispru- dence over the past several decades.12 The essence of the argument is that an institution may condition voluntary economic benefits with re- quirements that, if imposed outright, would be illegal. To the contrary, however, are rejection of the right/privilege distinction in constitutional law122 and the prohibition of unconstitutional conditions.123 Second, this reasoning, carried to its logical extreme, would appear to hold the same result even if the economic consequence of engaging in disapproved treatment were loss of employment or hospital staff privi- leges. Just as insurance companies and the government are free to de- termine what treatment they are willing to cover, hospitals would be free to determine what sorts of physicians they want on the medical staff. It is not considered to be a coercive restriction that Catholic hospi- tals and Christian Science institutions impose specific limitations on the way in which medicine is practiced in their facilities.124 Financially troubled hospitals likewise could enforce even detailed, case-specific treatment restrictions on pain of the loss of the opportunity to practice. The degree of intrusion and the underlying rationale is of no conse- quence under this line of reasoning. Although funding limitations and other economic sanctions do not absolutely preclude physicians from following their own judgment, se- vere sanctions may have the same practical effect. Except in semantical and social niceties, a command does not differ elementally from a re- quest attached to a consequence. If the consequence is an opprobrious sanction, any distinction between choice and compulsion becomes a chi- mera. Realistically, physicians cannot be expected to treat patients re- peatedly without reimbursement, and if the sanction takes the effect of 121 See J. BLUM, P. GERTMAN, &amp; J.

As with physician control of physicians, the unlicensed practice law is not capable of ad- dressing interference with practice concerns at the level of subtlety de- manded by real world practices. 2. Shielding Physicians from Interference a. An Inchoate Principle Observing the inapplicability of the medical practice act is not to say that the law is unconcerned with lesser degrees of interference than overt control of medical treatment by lay administrators. From several sources in the law there is evident a nascent principle that potentially insulates individual clinical decisions from nonmedical interference of any source or magnitude. Expressed positively, courts have commented that "the ability of a physician to exercise his professional judgment in the diagnosis and care of his patients is well-established and should be protected against unreasonable interference."126 Similarly, the Medi- 125 Unease with these realities is reflected in the federal courts' inconsistency on the validity of Medicare utilization controls. The same volume that reports Association of American Physicians &amp; Surgeons also contains a case decided by another judge on the same court that applies the opposite reasoning to a very similar utilization review process. See American Medical Ass'n v. Weinberger, 395 F. Supp. 515 (N.D. Ill. 1975). The court reasoned with respect to a prior approval requirement for reimburse- ment of hospital admissions that "the practical effect of the regulations is to deny ad- mission, even if the terms of the regulations do not." Id. at 523; see also infra note 140 and accompanying text (discussing courts' treatment of mandatory consultation condi- tions on hospital staff privileges). Another area of analogous precedent worth mention- ing is the restriction on the FDA's authority to "interfere with medical practice." One court has held that this restriction prevents the FDA from limiting the uses for which a physician can prescribe an approved drug. See United States v. Evers, 453 F. Supp. 1141, 1149 (M.D. Ala. 1978) ("There is no indication that an over-65 indigent recipi- ent of Medicare or Medicaid, if not admitted under these programs, could otherwise pay for the hospitalization prescribed by the attending doctor . . . .

The structure of mandatory second surgical opinion programs, which have grown quite common during the last decade,129 manifests this sensitivity to protecting physician autonomy from intra- as well as inter-professional interference. These programs require as a condition of reimbursement for certain "elective" surgeries that the patient obtain a second, confirmatory opinion of the need for surgery. If the second opinion is negative, however, the patient may seek a third opinion. Even if the third opinion is negative, the patient may still undergo the operation.130 Partly out of concern for preserving the integrity of the primary physician/patient relationship,'13 the insurance companies and progressive society has an enormous stake in recognizing and protecting this right of the physician."), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 949 (1979); State ex rel.

It is necessary to frame this concern within a rec- ognized legal doctrine.186 b. The Tortious Interference Doctrine A novel approach to these issues is to view them through the lens of tortious interference with advantageous relationships. This broadly articulated private law doctrine protects against "improper" interfer- ence with any type of existing or prospective contractual relationship.187 The doctrine is fully capable of activating the law's inchoate protection of individual patient/physician relationships from interference because the tort applies to any source of interference, lay or professional, and its highly malleable character allows it to adjust to varying degrees of in- terference. If a physician's judgment is dictated by orders from fellow professionals or if economic sanctions tied to treatment regimens are too severe, "impropriety" is the only concept the court must invoke to strike the arrangement.388 Thus, a hospital or HMO that restrained a physi- 136 Some courts and attorneys attempt to analyze these issues in constitutional terms, drawing force from the abortion cases' protection under the privacy interest of the "woman's right to receive medical care in accordance with her .. .physician's best judgment." Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 197 (1973); see, e.g., J. BLUM, P. GERTMAN &amp; J. RABINOW, supra note 121, at 102. However, stretching these controversial deci- sions beyond the abortion context to extend to any medical treatment opens a Pandora's box of unwieldy questions. A host of essential health care laws ranging from physician licensure to FDA regulation would, contrary to existing case law, be cast in constitu- tional doubt if subjected to the scrutiny that the Supreme Court has given abortion laws in the past decade. See People v. Privitera, 23 Cal. 3d 697, 702, 591 P.2d 919, 922, 153 Cal. Rptr. 431, 433 (1979) (holding that the "right" to obtain laetrile is not protected by the right to privacy embodied in either the Federal or California constitutions); Bowland v. Municipal Court, 18 Cal. 3d 479, 487, 556 P.2d 1081, 1084, 134 Cal. Rptr. 630, 633 (1976) (California statute regulating midwifery does not violate the prospective mother's right to privacy). In any event, only governmental health care institutions would be subject to such constitutional scrutiny. Similarly, the Medicare noninterference provision, 42 U.S.C. ? 1395 (1982), which applies only to actions by federal officers or agents, does not cover private initiatives in response to government reimbursement policy. 137 W. PROSSER &amp; W. KEETON, THE LAW OF TORTS ? 129 (5th ed. 1984); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS ?? 766A, 766B (1979). 138 An important limitation of the tort potentially restricts its application in this context.

Indeed, several courts have sus- tained tortious interference as a legitimate theory under which to chal- lenge exclusions from a hospital medical staff.139 Also, in non-tort con- texts, courts have relied on interference principles to police the validity of medical staff regulations such as mandatory consultation.140 ships, are terminable at will, see Kelly v. St. Vincent Hosp., 102 N.M. 201, 207, 692 P.2d 1350, 1356 (Ct. App. 1984), it might be argued that medical institutions enjoy carte blanche permission to intervene in that relationship as required to pursue their legitimate economic interests under a constrained reimbursement system. However, courts have balked at applying ordinary business logic to the special nature of the pa- tient/physician relationship, finding that it "is deserving of more attention from the law than a businessman's expectation of profit from a purely commercial transaction."

While some courts require a clear showing of malicious intent to interfere,141 the more prevalent approach is to consider motive as only one factor in the balancing process that determines impropriety.142 Thus, even if a medi- cal institution's policies are pursued without any desire to interfere with the patient/physician relationship, realization that interference is the likely effect may be sufficient to impose liability if the judge's or jury's personal economic philosophy and social sympathy are aligned against the institution.143 Lessening the degree of interference also does not provide a safe harbor for hospitals because the degree of interfer- ence is just one of the factors that courts balance to determine impro- priety.144 The resulting uncertainty of what activities courts will view as improper creates an unacceptable degree of risk in a dynamic busi- ness environment buffeted by rapidly changing policies and economic forces.

The courts appear to be policing the reasonableness of internal hospital rules by weighing the competing interests of the physician and the hos- pital.14" This balance has been set only for rules that address the qual- ity of medical care.146 There is substantial doubt that courts would give the same weight to rules that hospitals justify on the basis of cost.147 Even if the ultimate balance of reasonableness tips in the hospital's favor, the mere expense and risk of litigation deters innovation. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify several categories of cases where tortious interference challenges should be summarily dismissed. Retroactive utilization review should be beyond reproach because it im- poses only a minimal degree of interference.148 In the context of quality 145 See, e.g., Lewin, 82 Cal.App. at 389-90, 146 Cal. Rptr. at 905; Radiology Professional Corp. v. Trinidad Area Health Ass'n, 195 Colo. 253, 258-59, 577 P.2d 748, 751 (1978) (balancing interests of physicians and hospital when hospital entered exclusive contract for radiology services); Fahey v.

See supra text accompa- nying notes 97-101. Courts have also recognized that the rapid pace of technological development in medicine since the mid-century has placed new demands on medical institutions. Courts have thus allowed hospitals to restrict the range of procedures that physicians may perform and to limit certain technologically complex fields to selected specialists, rejecting the challenge that such arrangements restrict the range of profes- sional judgment or dictate to whom generalists may refer their patients. See, e.g., Radi- ology Professional Corp., 195 Colo. at 258, 577 P.2d at 751-52; Cobb County-Kennes- tone Hosp. Auth., 242 Ga. at 150, 249 S.E.2d at 588; Fahey, 32 Ill.

Ass'n, 453 Pa. 60, 82, 311 A.2d 634, 642, 645 (1973). 147 For instance, it was only after much thought and analysis that the court in Cobb County-Kennestone Hosp. Auth. upheld a hospital requirement that physicians use the in-house facilities for CAT scans rather than transporting patients outside to a scanner owned by the physicians. Were a hospital to condition staff privileges on when and how often a physician may use its CAT scanner, the result might differ because the "preeminent consideration in adoption of such a resolution" would no longer be "the health and safety of the patient." Cobb County-Kennestone Hosp. Auth., 242 Ga. at 150, 249 S.E.2d at 588. 148 Other easily sustained cases include those in which a supervising physician is also the patient's physician. There, no interference occurs because treatment decisions are ultimately in the hands of one of the attending physicians. If the analysis were otherwise, the operation of teaching hospitals would be impossible since their function- ing depends on senior physician approval of training physician orders. See E. FREID- SON, supra note 48, at 155. Also, non-mandatory directives do not contravene interfer- ence principles because there is no displacement of the physician's ultimate authority. Common examples include prohibiting "standing orders" for diagnostic workups on admission but allowing such workups with the specific, signed order of the attending physician in a particular case, and requiring an explanation before the continuation of</page><page sequence="44">474 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 control, the law has resolved the tensions between professional auton- omy and institutional control by allowing hospitals to evaluate a physi- cian's past treatment experience without requiring contemporaneous in- tervention in the practice details of individual cases.149 The same compromise should apply in the context of cost control. Criticism of a physician's overutilization is no more interference with medical judg- ment than criticism of underutilization.l60 Even if retroactive review is particular to specific cases, as occurs when insurance companies or gov- ernment programs refuse to pay based on the lack of medical necessity, the after-the-fact nature of the determination should preclude an inter- ference challenge.151 D. Interference Doctrine and Physician Autonomy 1. The Law's Protection of Group and Individual Autonomy The crux of our problem is this: In order for health care cost con- tainment to succeed, we must abandon the established orthodoxy that shields the purity of medical decisionmaking from any outside influ- ence, yet retain that degree of protection necessary to ensure sound medical judgment. The law has not yet struck the proper balance. prophylactic antibiotic treatment for more than 24 hours. 149 Thus, the hospital tissue committee might conclude that a surgeon's low per- centage of diseased tissues removed indicates an excessive number of unnecessary operations. 150 Active screening of medical decisions in particular cases before or during the process of treatment differs markedly from retroactive evaluation, in much the same way that prior restraints on speech differ from prosecutions for past speech-related offenses. A utilization review committee's finding that a physician is ordering too many x-rays, for example, is a finding in the abstract, and any interference in the treatment of a particular patient is speculative and attenuated. See Scott, supra note 72, at 220. Two contemporaneous Northern District of Illinois decisions that reached different out- comes on the validity of separate Medicare utilization review programs nicely illustrate this point. See supra text accompanying notes 118, 125. Weinberger, which invalidated a utilization review program, concerned a prior authorization requirement for the hos- pitalization of each patient. Mathews, which upheld PSRO review, concerned the set- ting of general treatment standards that applied only in the abstract. 151 Such review does not prohibit performance of the procedure; it only imposes a financial burden on the patient. While this is interference to some degree, it is essential to any effective oversight: the insurer's only alternative is to submit to the conflict of interest inherent in allowing the physician who is paid to be the sole judge of the necessity of the service. As one court recently explained in upholding medical necessity review, "it is unlikely that any insurer could permit the subscriber free selection of a physician if it were required to accept without question the physician's view of reasona- ble treatment and good medical practice." Sarchett v. Blue Shield, 43 Cal. 3d 1, 11, 729 P.2d 267, 274, 233 Cal. Rptr. 76, 83 (1987); see also Lockshin v. Blue Cross, 70 Ohio App. 2d 70, 72-73, 434 N.E.2d 754, 756 (1980) (arguing that "a function, basic to the insurer, is the right .. 'to determine whether . . . [a] claim should be allowed or rejected' ").</page><page sequence="45">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 475 Medical practice acts properly limit the use of lay medical directives to achieve institutional influence through command from outside the pro- fession. Medical institutions may avoid this limitation by imposing con- trol from within the profession, but this too will cause massive profes- sional resistance because physicians prize both their collegial and their clinical autonomy. While the law's treatment of more subtle forms of interference in the patient/physician relationship has not yet been for- mulated into doctrine, tortious interference is fully capable of protecting doctors from all forms of encroachment on medical judgment, whether from a lay or a peer source. The law has always accommodated a degree of institutional over- sight of medical practice. For example, hospitals may supervise physi- cians to promote the quality of health care162 and religious institutions may prohibit specific procedures to promote their beliefs.163 The same accommodation is required in an era of cost containment and the tor- tious interference doctrine allows sufficient flexibility to accommodate the demands of this complex policy environment. The risk is still strong, however, that courts will apply the undefined tortious interfer- ence concept with an inflexibility that fails to recognize the need for some economic influence. Thus, the law fully embodies physicians' in- tensely libertarian professional ethic by protecting the prerogative of the individual doctor from potentially any nonmedical influence, in- cluding the costs of treatment. 2. Cookbook Medicine and the Art and Science of Health Care Physician resistance to interference is warranted, to a degree. Most medical practice does not lend itself to lock-step directives from either lay or professional sources because of the intensely judgmental,54 indi- vidualistic,155 uncertain,156 and humane167 nature of health care. Thus, 152 See supra notes 97-99 and accompanying text. 153 See supra note 124 and accompanying text. 154 "[J]udgment as such cannot be objectified because it is at least in part a matter of opinion: it would not be wise to create formal codes or rules placing one opinion, theory, or school over another." E. FREIDSON, supra note 48, at 162. 155 [M]edical practice is typically occupied with the problems of individuals rather than of aggregates or statistical units. . . . Thus, even when gen- eral scientific knowledge may be available, the mere fact of individual va- riability poses a constant problem for assessment that emphasizes the ne- cessity for personal firsthand examination of every individual case and the difficulty of disposition on some formal, abstract scientific basis. Id. at 164. Harris argues that "top-down control" cannot "effectively modulate the individual, decentralized cost-benefit decision clinicians need to make." Harris, supra note 29, at</page><page sequence="46">476 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 "efficiency protocols . . can only be medically sound if they allow considerable room for clinical freedom."168 As the argument is fre- quently put: "One cannot practice good medicine by committee or cook- book or computer.

Havighurst makes the perceptive observation that the great range of possible exigencies for most medical services accounts for the absence of a regulatory or contrac- tual approach in the law to governing medical decisions. "For most medical services, the range of possible exigencies is so great that no imaginable contract or regulation could explicitly state the physician's duty under all of them." Instead of an attempt to state a physician's duty explicitly, we rely on general notions of duty under tort law and a deference to professional custom.

The history of the progress of computer programs in grappling with clinical deci- sionmaking illustrates the strength of this limitation. Two decades of work on artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis have resulted in little success in developing a system capable of performing diagnostic tasks adequately.

We should be skeptical of the extent of judgmental latitude sought by doctors because much of the judgmental aura that surrounds medical practice is due to physicians' use of uncertainty to create domains of control and influence.16? This uncertainty exists in part due to physi- cian opposition to attempts at reaching a scientific consensus on ques- tions of clinical practice. The profession's motives in suppressing the full play of scientific certainty are demonstrated by the AMA's active role in demolishing the National Center for Health Care Technology, an agency whose work was considered critical to achieving greater standardization in medicine. The AMA argued that "the center should not make general statements about appropriate medical care" because this was "trying to dictate the practice of medicine."61' Healthy skepticism is also warranted because the profession has taken widely inconsistent positions on the art/science characterization of medicine.162 Physicians trumpet the scientific basis of medicine when it suits their purpose. At the turn of the century, the medical profession relied on the scientific foundation of allopathic theory to establish ex- clusive authority over the domain of medical practice through licensing pie, TECHNOLOGY REV., Jan. 1986, at 42, 44. At a minimum, "major intellectual and technical problems must be solved before we can produce truly reliable consulting pro- grams."

A.M.A. 61, 65 (arguing that "there are still major challenges to be overcome before integrated tools with broad clinical capabilities will be widely available"). Professional expertise is too dependent on intuitive thought processes that operate in a gestalt fashion. In short, medicine is more art than science.

The medical profession depends on its scientific foundations to exclude alternative practitioners and thereby preserve group auton- omy,166 but if medicine were all science, doctors could not justify inde- pendence from fellow physicians. Consequently, the profession quickly shifts to clinical uncertainty to suppress even internal oversight. In this way, it plays both sides of the science/art fence in order to maintain complete freedom from control. The flaw in this position is that clinical uncertainty does not pre- clude all forms of influence, only detailed directives. If a broad range of practice styles exist because we do not know the optimal level of care, then it is impossible to maintain that bad medicine results from influ- encing physicians to skew their treatment decisions toward a more con- servative end of the grey zone of medical judgment. Bringing outside, non-medical influence to bear on clinical judgment is therefore consis- tent with both the art and the science of medicine: each is honored by leaving the final treatment decision with the physician. 3. The Prospects for Efficiency Protocols Thus, while there may be an irreducible intuitive core to medical practice, the domain that belongs to art has been artificially inflated to preserve physician autonomy.166 It is possible and desirable to bring greater definition and certainty to much of medical practice. Treatment protocols, whether written or computerized, serve some useful purpose 163 See Havighurst, supra note 57, at 706.

Where written specifications exist in traditional medical practice set- tings, they consistently are formulated as guidelines or suggestions rather than as rules.'69 Even in today's environment where administra- tive rules are being considered more frequently and applied more broadly, the rules are not absolute.170 In sum, while standardization of the science component of medical practice is unquestionably beneficial, the art of medical practice must be left unaffected. Inevitably, then, treatment directives have only a limited potential for bringing medical decisionmaking within the arena of cost contain- ment. Detailed standards are capable of covering only a very limited part of the medical treatment terrain, and it is impossible for both theo- retical and practical reasons to impose on physicians a new treatment philosophy. They must be allowed to evolve their own practice styles. To precipitate and sustain this process, it is necessary to supplement general treatment guidelines with an intervention that maintains con- tinuing influence on discrete treatment decisions, an intervention that alters more fundamentally the basic incentives that influence physician behavior. 167 See Schwartz, Patil &amp; Szlovits, supra note 159, at 687 (discussing the useful- ness of computer-generated diagnostic hypotheses or plans for treatment by "provid[ing] a checklist that helps the user make certain that no . . .possibility has been overlooked"). 168 See infra notes 173-84 and accompanying text. 169 See E.

Motivating Physician Behavior The intervention with the best prospect for reconciling physician autonomy with cost control is structuring financial incentives to reward conservative treatment. We have learned that preserving physician au- tonomy, both on a collective and an individual level, is a social and a practical necessity for effective physician control.171 Only the exercise of professional judgment and discretion in each case will permit the indi- vidualization of patient care that is required to maintain humane ser- vice. What is needed, then, is some form of decentralized influence that preserves complete autonomy by internalizing cost consciousness at the bedside level. Health care can only be transformed by altering the pro- cess by which doctors make day-to-day treatment decisions. The need for intervention that fundamentally alters the basic incentives that in- fluence physician behavior can be better understood after a closer ex- amination of the nature of clinical judgment. 1. Financial Motivation and the Nature of Clinical Judgment Some control strategies, such as physician education,72 mistakenly assume that doctors incorporate careful, systematic evaluations of alter- native courses of treatment into their clinical decisionmaking in each case.173 Instead, doctors, as do other professionals, operate from certain ground rules or "heuristics" as they are called. These decisionmaking shortcuts eliminate the need to reason from first principles and elemen- tal facts in every case. The best hard evidence of the nature of clinical judgment is pro- vided by the several decades of work by Dartmouth epidemiologist John Wennberg. He has documented tremendous variations in the rate at which surgical procedures are performed among neighboring locali- ties, despite nearly identical demographic and health profiles.174 The 171 See supra notes 110-12 and accompanying text. 172 See, e.g., Wong &amp; Lincoln, supra note 70, at 2511 (describing unsuccessful effort to lower the rate of laboratory test misuse through education). 173 See id. 174 See Wennberg, McPherson &amp; Caper, Will Payment Based on Diagnosis-Re- lated Groups Control Hospital Costs?, 311 NEW.

"Pro- fessional certainty serves purposes of maintaining professional power and control over the medical decision-making process as well as of maintaining an aura of infallibility."18' Consequently, instead of ac- knowledging uncertainty, physicians assume a "mask of infallibility." "[T]he reality of medical uncertainty is generally brushed aside as doc- ENCE 1102, 1104 (1973) (finding that Medicare reimbursement for diagnostic x-rays varied by 400 percent between service areas in the state of Vermont, and EKG reim- bursement by 600 percent).

Physicians attempt to cope with this schizophrenia by a sort of herd instinct: their clinical decisions are strongly influenced by a shared practice style.183 To guide their daily treatment decisions, physicians rely heavily on a clinical instinct, an acting out of habit, that is learned as part of the professional "folklore" acquired during the professional socialization process.184 Consciously or not, physicians act not from a scientific reexamination of first principles in each case but out of a shared practice style or philosophy grounded in soft reasoning processes such as intuition and judgment. Consequently, the control strategy that will work best is to influ- ence physicians to change their practice styles, to acquire a new treat- ment philosophy, through a motivational force that orients them toward a more conservative end of the acceptable range of variation in medical practice. We have witnessed this in Great Britain, where physicians are 182 Id. at 166; see also Luft, supra note 176, at 510 ("[I]ndividual physicians tend to prefer and to use one mode of treatment and do not behave as though there is a gray area characterized by uncertainty."). 183 See Burum, Medical Practice a la Mode: How Medical Fashions Determine Medical Care, 317 NEW ENG.

If fee-for-service or cost-based reimbursement is seen as the source of health care's excesses, reversing financial incentives to reward physi- cians for less rather than more treatment can be expected to change practice styles across the board. Structuring financial rewards can be a powerful control technique because this is a single intervention that has a continuing, decentralized influence on the universe of individual treatment decisions.186 2. HMO and Hospital Financial Incentive Plans Financial incentives are used to shape the practice patterns in both the HMO and the hospital industry. There are two primary structural forms of incentives: plans that reward physicians based on their indi- vidual levels of performance and plans that reward groups of physi- cians for their combined performance. HMOs best illustrate the variety of ways in which health care institutions attempt to induce more economical practice through finan- cial incentives.187 HMOs are worthy of careful study because of the substantial savings potential they have demonstrated. HMO physicians hospitalize their patients as much as 40% less than the norm with little accompanying increase in the amount of ambulatory care.188 A different 185 See generally H. AARON &amp; W. SCHWARTZ, THE PAINFUL PRESCRIPTION (1984) (comparing the levels of health care in Great Britain and the United States). 186 One need not assume that physicians consciously act from economic motives to believe that reversing financial incentives will change physician behavior. It is only necessary to concede that the background financial framework for medical decisionmak- ing creates an environment that tends to foster one type of behavior over another. As Harold Luft explains in the context of HMO bonus plans: [I]t is extremely unlikely that HMO physicians reflect upon the impact on their bonuses each time they consider a follow-up visit or an extra test. Instead, certain routine patterns are probably developed that tend to be consistent with their economic incentives. Inconsistent patterns may be re- examined and slowly adjusted to reduce conflict with system incentives. Luft, Health Maintenance Organizations and the Rationing of Medical Care, 60 MILBANK MEM. FUND Q. 268, 275 (1982); see also Luft, supra note 184, at 103, 118 (questioning the degree to which economic incentives affect physicians' conscious deci- sions about medical treatment). 187 This Article does not attempt to cover the universe of financial incentives for cost containment. In addition to the types discussed in this section, some HMOs operate under a capitation form of payment, whereby individual physicians are paid a flat rate per patient for the year. Traditionally, surgeons are also paid a flat fee per case. See J. EISENBERG, supra note 33, at 132. 188 See Epstein, Begg &amp; McNeil, The Use of Ambulatory Testing in Prepaid and Fee-For-Service Group Practices, 314 NEW ENG. J.

IPAs typically compensate their physicians on a dis- counted fee-for-service basis, supplemented by bonuses for efficient per- formance or reduced by penalties for inefficiency.190 Many health policy analysts maintain that salaried employment is the optimal form of physician reimbursement. A fixed salary neutral- izes the distorting financial incentives inherent in fee-for-service pay- ment but does not penalize careful and thorough treatment. Unfettered by financial pressures toward either overutilization or underutilization of medical resources, physicians are free to exercise their best medical judgment.19 However, when the physicians' "best medical judgment" has been schooled in the fee-for-service mode of treatment, physicians accus- tomed to a fee-for-service practice style can be expected to continue the same practices even if inflationary financial incentives are removed. Therefore, it is not clear that salaried compensation is the source of HMO success. More likely, HMO practice styles are moderated by group financial incentives. If doctors have an ownership interest in their HMO, profit distributions are awarded based on the group's effi- cent fewer electrocardiograms and 40 percent fewer chest radiographs); Manning, Leibowitz, Goldberg, Rogers &amp; Newhouse, A Controlled Trial of the Effect of Prepaid Group Practice on Use of Services, 310 NEW ENG. J. MED. 1505, 1505 (1984) (40 percent less hospitalization). The evidence concerning ambulatory costs is somewhat inconclusive because HMO patients seek more preventive care such as annual check- ups, but the intensity of service during HMO ambulatory visits is lower. See id. 189 There are several variations of these basic forms so that the full list of HMO models is somewhat longer, distinguishing between staff and group models, and be- tween traditional IPAs and network models. See generally H. LUFT, HEALTH MAIN- TENANCE ORGANIZATIONS: DIMENSIONS OF PERFORMANCE 4-6 (1981) (describing HMOs in general and listing several types); R. SHOULDICE &amp; K.

HEALTH POL. POL'Y &amp; L. 723, 724-25, 729-30 (1987) (describing two types of HMOs). 190 The form of financial incentive is not necessarily a definitional aspect of the HMO model. Rather, different types of HMOs have tended to rely on different com- pensation arrangements. This Article's focus on the most typical arrangements should not obscure the important experimentation that is taking place in the HMO industry. For example, IPAs are beginning to experiment with capitation payments to their phy- sicians. See Ginsburg &amp; Hackbarth, supra note 24, at 12; Welch, supra note 189, at 727-29. 191 See H. LUFT, supra note 189, at 353.</page><page sequence="55">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 485 ciency. If group doctors are employed, then they realize that the institu- tion's financial health affects the likelihood of receiving raises or bonuses. Individual Practice Associations illustrate how financial incentives can be focused even more directly on physician performance. IPAs were pioneered by the medical profession in the 1970s as a response to the classic HMO format. Not surprisingly, IPAs attempt to preserve fee- for-service reimbursement. To be competitive, these organizations must devise some means to eliminate wasteful treatment. The IPA innova- tion was to create a bonus/penalty system that makes physicians par- tially at risk for the costs of care. The essential concept is to allow physicians to retain a portion of the savings they generate when they avoid referrals to hospitals or outside specialists. There are a number of variations on this theme. For example, to pay for specialist and hospitalization charges, one IPA es- tablished an account for each physician consisting of a percentage of the premiums paid by that physician's patients. Each physician received half of any surplus that remained in her bonus pool and contributed half of any deficit, up to ten percent of the her HMO revenue.192 Phy- sicians thus were directly rewarded for economizing and penalized for overspending.193 192 See Palay, Organizing an HMO by Contract: Some Transaction Cost Consid- erations, 65 NEB.

The Paracelsus DRG incentive plan paid each member of the medical staff a percentage of the profits the hospital earns from that physician's Medicare patients.'94 Hospitals can also reward profit- able physicians with certain in-kind or fringe benefits.195 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are implementing analogous arrangements on both an outpatient and inpatient basis. The Massachusetts plan pays obstetricians a bonus for shortening the length of stay for vaginal child- birth, and the North Carolina plan pays bonuses for performing certain procedures outside of the hospital.196 Evaluation of the performance of these various financial incentives is difficult because of the sparsity of hard evidence on the effectiveness of cost decreasing197 incentives.198 The best controlled study offered another.

For purposes of computing the profit margin, Paracelsus considered its costs to be 70 or 75 percent of its charges. The bonus percentage escalated from 10 to 20 percent as the profit margin increased. See id. &amp; n.1 An incentive plan proposed by another hospital works as follows. Each physician has an "efficiency index" that is determined by debits and credits earned for each pa- tient treated. Debits and credits are awarded according to whether the patient is dis- charged within the mean length of stay and whether ancillary service use is below the norm for that patient's condition. Each physician's index then determines her share of the hospital cost savings, to be paid only upon the physician's retirement or death. Only physicians with a certain level of admissions are eligible to participate. See Tatge, Illi- nois Hospital Awaits IRS Ruling on Prototype Physician Incentive Plan, 14 MOD. HEALTH CARE, June 1984, at 23, 23-24. 195 Examples of perquisites that hospitals sometimes provide to their favored phy- sicians on a partially or fully subsidized basis include: pharmaceuticals, office space and secretarial services, medical education seminars, billing and collection services, construc- tion loans, and joint venture opportunities. See FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 166 n.7. One in-kind benefit that is particularly attractive in this context is malpractice insurance because it has the added effect of diminishing the defensive medicine concerns that might thwart efficiency incentives. 196 See Egdahl &amp; Taft, supra note 192, at 60. 197 It is of course well known that cost increasing incentives have an effect, but those incentives work in favor of rather than against quality of care.

A later attempt to du- plicate this experiment failed because the residents objected to participating in a pro- gram with "demeaning" financial inducements. See Eisenberg &amp; Williams, supra note 33, at 13. 201 See, e.g., FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 166 n.7 (despite lack of systematic studies, HMO officials indicated that bonus system did not significantly affect utilization); H. LUFT, supra note 189, at 356 (effect of financial incentives on physician behavior is only indirect); Long, supra note 192, at 124-26 (study comparing foundation HMOs with fee-for-service equivalents and finding no difference in hospital utilization); Meier &amp; Tillotson, supra note 192, at 40 (HMO physicians interviewed felt that financial risk did not alter their practice patterns). One suspects, however, that these reports may be influenced by a desire to avoid any accusa- tion that HMO physicians unethically profit by withholding necessary treatment. 202 Traditionally, HMO patients have constituted only a small percentage of the patient base for IPA physicians. Therefore, even a sizeable bonus has little impact on the physicians' overall incomes. See J. EISENBERG, supra note 33, at 133 (noting "re- mote relationship between the doctors' own practice, the HMO balance sheet, and doc- tors' bonuses"); H. LUFT, supra note 189, at 356 (citing Meier and Tillotson study that indicates physicians in HMOs generally bear a low level of financial risk); Meier &amp; Tillotson, supra note 192, at 40, 71-72 (noting that "none of the physicians inter- viewed had more than 10 percent of their total income directly at risk, and most far less than that"). The potential loss of 10 to 15 percent of HMO receipts is even more inconspicuous considering that physicians generally do not expect to collect 100 percent of their billings. See id. at 19-20 (physicians noted that collection rates on their fee-for- service practices were 90-92 percent and that a risk of less than 10 percent would be comparable to a bonus). For IPA physicians, then, it has not been shown that financial incentives have no effect, only that the incentives are not large enough to be felt. See id. at 71-72 ("It is not known what effect 30 to forty percent risk may have on a physician."). More recent forms of IPAs with a higher concentration of HMO patients and a larger incentive percentage demonstrate more favorable results.

There have been important innovations in the use of efficiency incentives, but full study and development have been deterred by the ethical sensitivity that surrounds overt acknowledgement of financial inducement in health care. Exploratory efforts not blocked by profes- sional resistance have been somewhat timid, and those fully imple- mented are clouded by the subdued nature of the reports of success. B. An Overview of Fee Splitting Prohibitions Institutional cost containment techniques that rely on financial in- centives must contend with a group of federal and state statutory prohibitions against medical fee splitting. A hospital or HMO that dis- tributes part of its receipts to doctors as an incentive for efficient prac- tice can be accused of illegally splitting its fees with the doctors.203 There are two sets of fee splitting statutes: one is focused principally on fee splitting as an inducement to treat (referral fees) and the other on fee splitting as an inducement not to treat (antireferral fees). The most threatening referral fee prohibition is the federal Medi- care/Medicaid fraud and abuse statute, which, paraphrased, declares that anyone who pays or receives any remuneration directly or indi- rectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind for the referral of a patient to a person for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid is guilty of a felony punish- able by five years imprisonment or $25,000, or both.204 Many states also directly criminalize referral fees,205 and medical practice acts fre- quently enumerate the payment of referral fees as one of the grounds is withheld). 203 More pejoratively, the payment might be characterized as a kickback or rebate. 204 See 42 U.S.C. ? 1395nn(b) (1982). Many state codes duplicate this provision with respect to their Medicaid programs. See, e.g., IND. CODE ANN. ? 12-1-7-28.2 (West 1982); MASS. GEN. LAWS ANN. ch 118E, ? 21B (West Supp. 1988). 205 See, e.g., CAL. Bus. &amp; PROF. CODE ? 650 (West Supp. 1988); CAL. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE ? 445 (West 1979); COLO. REV.

California's statute, which has received the most discussion, states, "[T]he .. .receipt or acceptance, by any [physician] of any rebate, refund, com- mission . . . or other consideration, whether in the form of money or otherwise, as compensation or inducement for referring patients . . . to any person . . . is unlaw- ful."

A new federal statute, part of the Omnibus Budget Rec- onciliation Act of 1986207 ("OBRA 1986"), is directed in precisely the opposite direction: at cost containment incentive plans that share fees in order to reduce services. It allows the Department of Health and Human Services to assess civil monetary penalties of up to $2000 against a hospital that "makes a payment, directly or indirectly, to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit services provided with respect to [Medicare or Medicaid patients] who . . . are under the di- rect care of the physician."28 This prohibition of efficiency incentives is scheduled to extend to HMOs as well beginning April 1, 1990.209 Because there is little authoritative interpretation of the meaning and application of these varied and complex statutes, determining the validity of a fee splitting accusation is no simple matter. One must iron out the interpretational wrinkles before taking a broader policy per- spective. This discussion, therefore, first assesses whether the fee split- ting concept, as it has been developed in various legal interpretations, in fact fits financial cost containment incentives. It then assesses whether this concept should fit such incentives. Two different forms of financial incentives will be examined: individual physician plans and group incentive plans. 206 See, e.g., ALA. CODE ? 34-24-360(10) (Supp. 1987); D.C.

Individual Physician Plans The recent Congressional prohibition of efficiency incentives clearly prohibits arrangements, such as Paracelsus' DRG plan, that pay individual physicians for reducing services.210 However, this an- tireferral fee statute provides only modest civil penalties in contrast to the severe licensure and felony sanctions that follow from referral fee statute violations. Moreover, HMOs are not presently covered by the new prohibition, and there is some question whether the scheduled ex- tension to them will ever occur.21' The more pressing concern, there- fore, is the legality of efficiency incentives under conventional referral fee statutes. Although individual physician incentive plans involve the splitting with physicians of the hospitals' and HMOs' fees,212 the Medicare/ 210 Note, however, three possible escape routes. One is to base rewards on some- thing other than the "reduc[tion] or limit[ation] of services." A hospital might reward physicians who substitute certain lower cost modes of treatment, for example, an X-ray rather than a CAT scan, in certain defined situations. Dechene, Physician Incentive Programs: Are They Legal?, HEALTH SPAN, Jan. 1987, at 3, 9. This would create serious concerns under the fraud and abuse and referral fee statutes, however, because the payments would be directly related to the number of tests ordered. Also, such spe- cific directions backed by economic sanctions raise concerns about interference with the practice of medicine. See supra notes 76-146 and accompanying text. Another possible escape route is to design plans that apply only to hospital-based physicians, such as radiologists and anesthesiologists, who do not have independent re- lationships with their patients. The legislative history explicitly states that "[t]he prohi- bition . . . would not apply to a physician who provides ancillary services under con- tract to a hospital." COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1986, H.R. 5300, H.R. REP. No. 727, 99TH CONG., 2D SESS. 445, reprinted in 1986 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; ADMIN. NEWS 3607, 3842 [herein- after H.R. REP. No. 727]. The theory is that payments to such physicians do not meet the requirement of being related to patients who "are under the direct care of the physician." 42 U.S.C.A. ? 1320a-7a(b)(1)(C) (West Supp. 1988); see Dechene, supra, at 7. This rationale is not wholly convincing. Although hospital-based physicians are not the primary or attending doctor, they render direct care, as do consulting physi- cians. Perhaps a better explanation is that some (but not all) ancillary care physicians do not determine the quantity of services. X-rays, for instance, are typically ordered by the treating physician and only performed by the radiologist. This simply establishes, however, that it would be moot to target such nonordering physicians. The same House Report notes a more promising escape route: It is the Committee's intent that the prohibition not apply to hospital incentive arrangements with physicians who have a management or super- visory responsibility with respect to the operation of a hospital department . .. insofar as the purpose of the arrangement is limited to encouraging efficiency in the operation of the department. H.R. REP. No. 727, supra, at 445. 211 See supra note 248 and accompanying text. 212 The fact that these plans involve payments by institutions rather than by phy- sicians might raise a possible defense because some of the state statutes are directed only at physicians. See supra note 206. However, these statutes have been interpreted</page><page sequence="61">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 491 Medicaid fraud and abuse statute and the classic forms of the state disciplinary and criminal fee splitting statutes do not appear to reach these arrangements.213 These provisions generally prohibit fee division for the referral of patients. Hospital and HMO incentive payments, in sharp contrast, are intended to reduce treatment. These antireferral fees are earned by not recommending treatment, by not hospitalizing, and by not referring to specialists. Efficiency incentives combat pre- cisely the evil that referral fee prohibitions target: inflated charges and overutilization. Thus, on first encounter, the referral fee concept does not appear to apply to these plans.14 The analysis is more complex than this, however. Incentive plans can have a secondary effect that counters their primary antireferral as proscribing fee splitting generally, either under the theory that the institution is aiding and abetting in the enterprise, see 16 Cal. Op. Att'y Gen. 18, 27 (1950), or under the theory that the statute expresses a general public policy against fee splitting. See State v. Abortion Information Agency, Inc., 37 A.D.2d 142, 144, 330 N.Y.S.2d 927, 929 (1971), affd, 30 N.Y.2d 779, 285 N.E.2d 317, 337 N.Y.S.2d 174 (1972). 213 To the extent that incentive plans rely on in-kind benefits rather than cash payments, see supra note 195, they are even easier to defend because some state statutes appear only to prohibit the payment of monetary referral fees, in contrast with those statutes that broadly prohibit any form of compensation. The following statutes have the narrower proscriptions: ALA. CODE ? 34-24-360(10) (Supp. 1987); COLO. REV. STAT. ? 12-36-125 (1985); GA. CODE ANN. ? 43-34-37(a)(9) (Supp. 1987); IND.

LAWS ? 5-37-5.1(12) (1987); TENN. CODE ANN. ? 63-6-214(16) (1986). 214 Most commentators who have considered the legality of hospital incentive plans agree. See GAO REPORT, supra note 194, at 9, 12, 24; see also Dechene, supra note 210, at 6 (reporting that the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance has ruled that hospital incentive plans do not violate the California referral fee statute); Reiss &amp; Ward, Medicare Fraud and Abuse Issues Involving Alternative Delivery Sys- tems, TOPICS IN HosP.

AM. HOSP. REV., Sept.-Oct. 1985, at 45, 46 (stating that "hospitals that proceed with incentive compen- sation programs do so at some risk"). Almost no attention has been paid to HMO incentive plans. This may reflect the legality of a view that fee splitting is implicitly approved by the HMO enabling acts in many states because it is so central to their manner of operation. See infra note 248. This reasoning is supported by Albany Medical College v. McShane, 66 N.Y.2d 982, 489 N.E.2d 1278, 499 N.Y.S.2d 376 (1985), which addressed a fee splitting challenge to a typical faculty compensation arrangement at a teaching hospital. The court rea- soned that the division of hospital receipts among faculty physicians was implicitly sanctioned by the legislative grant of authority to operate a teaching hospital.

As a result, these plans potentially violate one of the primary purposes of fee splitting prohibitions, namely, to eliminate financial influence on a doc- tor's choice of the source of care. DRG plans, for instance, might in- duce doctors to direct their Medicare patients to the hospital with the most advantageous DRG bonus plan. This secondary incentive would be even more obvious under a plan that pays efficiency awards so indis- criminately that doctors would receive payments virtually in proportion to their hospital admissions. Subsidiary referral incentives underlying physician payments for nonreferral services have formed the basis for criminal convictions in other contexts. In the most prominent example, United States v. Greber,218 the federal government successfully prosecuted the owner of a cardiology diagnostic laboratory for violating the Medicare/Medicaid fraud and abuse statute by paying "interpretation fees" to referring physicians, ostensibly as compensation for evaluating the diagnostic data produced by laboratory tests. The court rejected the defense's con- tention that "compensating a physician for services actually rendered could not be a violation of the statute," reasoning in terms that appear to consider any secondary referral incentive as a potential felony of- fense.217 Greber casts serious doubt on the legality of individual physi- 215 In addition to this complication, not all of the state statutes speak in terms of fee splitting for referrals. Some proscribe fee splitting in the abstract, without mention of the purpose of the splitting. See ILL. ANN. STAT. ch. 23, para. 8A-3(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(3) (Smith-Hurd 1988); N.Y. EDUC.

Joint Ventures and Other Group Incentive Plans 1. Examples Institutions can also structure cost containment incentives for a group of doctors. For example, some HMOs pay their doctors a bonus based on the group's overall performance.220 Even without an explicit bonus, salaried HMO physicians are influenced by their realization that the group's performance affects the likelihood of receiving future raises. Like HMOs, hospitals also can create group incentives through techniques that align physicians' economic interests with those of the institution. The most direct method gives physicians an ownership in- terest in the institution. This approach is exemplified by the dying breed of physician-owned hospitals, the emerging breed of group- owned HMOs, and the resurging breed of physician-owned outpatient services.221 Physician proprietary interest is a strong vehicle for cost containment under prospective payment because doctors realize that their profit distributions depend on the costs of their treatment "to pay an equivalent for service." . . That a particular payment was a remuneration (which implies that a service was rendered) rather than a kickback, does not foreclose the possibility that a violation nevertheless could exist. ... If the payments were intended to induce the physician to use [the laboratory's] services, the statute was violated, even if the payments were also intended to compensate for professional services.

A hospital gives each of its departments its own budget and makes each accountable for its revenues and expenses. Each group of doctors thus has a stake in its department's perform- ance.223 If the department is run efficiently, then the doctors have more to spend on new equipment and other amenities of practice. Any shortfalls are taken out of the succeeding year's budget.224 Hospital group incentive plans are being discussed in a variety of other forms. DRG incentive plans can be constructed to reward the medical staff as a whole based the the hospital's overall performance 222 Although speculatively promising, there has been no careful study of the actual efficiency effects of physician ownership. One anecdotal discussion of HMOs reported that physician proprietary interest has little effect on the awareness of financial risk. This finding is tempered by the realization that significant at-risk ownership is rare. The risks of ownership are usually diffused through a large group of doctors or the doctors are backed by guarantees from a sponsoring organization. See Meier &amp; Tillot- son, supra note 192, at 21-22. 223 See Heyssel, Gaintner, Kues, Jones &amp; Lipstein, Decentralized Management in a Teaching Hospital, 310 NEW ENG. J. MED. 1477, 1477-80 (1984) [hereinafter Heyssel] (discussing the Johns Hopkins management structure). For a favorable discus- sion of departmental organization, see, e.g., D. YOUNG &amp; R.

An additional attraction is that this structure is capable of incorporating intersect- ing lines of authority through what is referred to in organization theory as a matrix design. See Kaluzny, Design and Management of Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Groups in Health Services: Review and Critique, 42 MED. CARE REV. 77, 83-84 (1985); Neuhauser, The Hospital as a Matrix Organization, HOSP. ADMIN., Fall 1972, at 8, 19-25. The essential construct is, vertically, for departmental administrators to exercise financial authority over each department while, horizontally, physicians or physician teams are accountable for coordinating patient care in individual cases among the various departments. See id. at 19-21. Theorists contend that this model is capable of reconciling competing institutional demands, such as quality versus cost or bureau- cratic control versus professional autonomy. See Scott, supra note 72, at 230 (discussing the possibilities of co-existence and interdependence). Unfortunately, the reported results are modest at best. During an eight-year pe- riod at Johns Hopkins, costs increased at a rate of 10.5 percent, only slightly less than the 11 percent growth rate for all Maryland hospitals. See Heyssel, supra, at 1478. Another study found no evidence that formal departmental structure decreases hospital expenditures. See Sloan &amp; Becker, Internal Organization of Hospitals and Hospital Costs, 18 INQUIRY 224, 236 (1981). Moreover, this departmental organization may be feasible only at very large hospitals, such as the 1000-bed Johns Hopkins. See Heyssell, supra, at 1477. 224 Hospitals can also structure DRG incentive plans to reward the medical staff as a whole based on the hospital's overall performance under Medicare.

More likely, hospitals will begin to form a variety of joint venture arrangements that give selected member physicians a type of proprietary interest in a limited aspect of the hospital enterprise, a less threatening approach to physician autonomy than other alternatives to the traditional medical staff.225 Hospital/physician joint ventures of assorted shapes and sizes are receiving enthusiastic promotion in the trade literature.26 The details of these proposals vary widely, but they share the same essential form: the hospital contracts with a group of doctors to provide hospital treatment; the joint venture then structures the group's reimbursement to reflect its efficiency.227 The venture can cover all hospital patients or only a portion of the business, such as that 225 See Glandon &amp; Morrisey, Redefining the Hospital-Physician Relationship Under Prospective Payment, 23 INQUIRY 166, 169 (1986). Joint ventures offer many of the features of selective employment but in a structure that better preserves physician autonomy than the traditional staff model. Like employment, the hospital deals only with a select group of physicians under a group compensation arrangement that fosters efficiency. The group, however, has responsibility for all matters relating to physician selection, supervision, and internal compensation. See id. at 169-71, 174. 226 See, e.g., id. at 170-71 (describing some of the benefits of joint ventures). An entertaining byproduct of this discussion is a renewal of health care's longstanding Bat- tle of the Acronyms. Ever since the early 1970s when Paul Ellwood and his associates championed the term "health maintenance organization" for what had previously been referred to more descriptively as simply prepaid group practice, see P. ELLWOOD, JR., N. ANDERSON, J. BILLINGS, R. CARLSON, E. HOAGBERG &amp; W. MCCLURE, THE HEALTH MAINTENANCE STRATEGY 2 (1970), health policy analysts have fought to establish authorship of acronyms for newly emerging delivery systems. For example, Hospitals is insistent on changing the accepted term "preferred provider organization" ("PPO") to "preferred provider arrangement" ("PPA"). See HOSPITALS, Dec. 1, 1985, at 9, 9, 11 (Reader Feedback). Currently, the fiercest contest is that being waged in the conference circuit between Ellwood and health care lawyer Jack Wood over their re- spective joint venture plans. Ellwood's scheme is termed a "MeSH," short for Medical Staff/Hospital. See Ellwood, When MDs Meet DRGs, HOSPITALS, Dec. 16, 1983, at 62, 62-63. Wood's proposal is termed a "PHO" for physician/hospital organization. See Wood, Health Trends, Medical Staff and PHO, in PRACTISING LAW INSTITUTE, HOSPITALS IN TODAY'S HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE 203, 210 (1985). These plans differ only in their particulars. It is difficult to make informed predictions of the concrete success of joint ventures. The joint venture concept is so fluid and nonspecific that it covers a broad range of interactions. For example, the way in which many emergency rooms and radiology departments are presently organized could easily be characterized as a joint venture. See Adamski v. Tacoma General Hosp., 20 Wash. App. 98, 108, 579 P.2d 970, 975 (1978) (describing a typical emergency room staffing arrangement in which hospital and physicians share profits). Truly novel arrangements are only occasionally imple- mented. See Morrisey &amp; Brooks, Hospital-Physician Joint Ventures: Who's Doing What, HOSPITALS, May 1, 1985, at 74, 74 (noting that joint ventures exist at only 11.76% of hospitals). Joint venture proponents admit that some proposals to share equal power and exercise mutual influence are somewhat utopian concepts. See Scott, supra note 72, at 230. Nevertheless, these and other group incentive arrangements show promise and deserve careful legal analysis. 227 For further descriptions of joint ventures, see Aird &amp; Skillicorn, Physician Culture: A Forgotten Ingredient, FRONTIERS HEALTH SERVICES MGMT., Feb. 1985, at 49, 52-53; Glandon &amp; Morrisey, supra note 225, at 169-71.</page><page sequence="66">496 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 generated by a contract with a particular HMO.228 A joint venture might compensate physicians for the treatment itself or for some other package of services. One frequently mentioned technique is to pay the physician group for utilization review services based on the group's ef- fectiveness in reducing the hospital's costs.229 2. Validity of Group Incentives Group incentive plans are more likely than individual physician incentive plans to survive scrutiny under state and federal referral-fee law. Generally, the variety of arrangements encompassed by the joint venture are valid if the physician investment is not used as a proxy to reward the level of physician referrals. For instance, the California at- torney general distinguishes between legal joint ventures that base dis- tributions on the level of legitimate investment and illegal plans that pay physicians according to the amount of business the doctors gener- ate.230 Similarly, the Department of Health and Human Services al- lows normal profit distributions to physicians based on a purchased ownership interest.23 Unfortunately, group incentive plans may be no safer than indi- vidual incentive plans under the federal antireferral statute.232 The re- 228 See Roble &amp; Mason, supra note 216, at 455-56. 229 See Dechene, supra note 210, at 9. s20 See Cal.

On the federal level, Representative Fortney Stark (D-CA) introduced a bill in the last Congress that would prohibit physi- cians from referring patients for Medicare-reimbursed services to facilities they own.

This is true despite the laundering of the bonus payments through a group organization and the dilution of the incentive through apportionment formulae. E. Evaluation of Fee-splitting Policy Fee splitting statutes cripple the institution's ability to respond to cost containment pressures with innovative strategies for motivating physician efficiency. This disability arises from two opposing conse- quences wrought by efficiency incentive payments: (1) the primary ef- fect of promoting the reduction of services and (2) the secondary effect of promoting referrals. Each side of the fee splitting coin needs to be addressed now from a policy perspective. 1. The Rationale for Referral Fee Prohibitions Classic fee splitting prohibitions attack referral fees. These prohibitions are intended to suppress inducements for ordering unnec- essary care and to eliminate influences on the choice of a source of care.234 These incentives are ubiquitous in traditional medical practice. "Practicing physicians now have financial interests in diagnostic labo- ratories, radiologic imaging centers, walk-in clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, dialysis units, physical therapy centers, and other such facili- ties. In most of these business ventures, the investing physicians' profits depend, at least in part, on referral of patients to these facilities .. .5235 Moreover, the fee-for-service payment method itself creates an 1988). 823 See 42 U.S.C.A. ?1320a-7a(b) (West Supp. 1988); see also supra notes 207-09 and accompanying text (discussing federal statute). Some have argued that this statute permits group incentive arrangements. The House Report explains that allowing phy- sicians to "share in an overall operating surplus" presents no threat to quality of care because "there is no direct link between [an individual] physician's treatment decision and the amount of any bonus received." H. R. REP. No. 727, supra note 210, at 444, reprinted in 1986 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; ADMIN. NEWS at 3841 (emphasis added). At least one prominent health care attorney has concluded that this "direct link" is critical to Congress' thinking. See Dechene, supra note 210, at 8-9. If so, this thinking did not survive the drafting process. 234 Cf Adams &amp; Klein, supra note 218, at 19 (discussing Medicare Anti-Fraud and Abuse Law). 236 Relman, Dealing With Conflicts of Interest, 313 NEW ENG.

Egdahl &amp; Taft, supra note 192, at 61 ("The U.S. health care system has become deeply entrepreneurial, with financial incentives incorporated at many levels.").</page><page sequence="68">498 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 inherent incentive to order self-referrals.236 Physicians who are influ- enced by a kickback to order unnecessary services or to choose referred care contrary to a patient's best interests would also be influenced by the fees they directly receive to perform inappropriate procedures themselves. Given the pervasiveness of self-referral incentives, it is difficult to understand why incentives for referrals to other doctors are so stigma- tized. A rule of necessity provides the best justification for distinguish- ing traditional treatment incentives from referral fees.237 When the in- centive is secondary to a beneficial purpose, as in the fee-for-service form of payment, it can be tolerated. When it is a naked payment, no social benefit justifies tolerance. We reluctantly accept the inflationary incentives of the fee-for-service system because they ensure physician fidelity to patients' interests. Naked referral fees have no such saving grace.238 Ultimately, however, this justification is unsatisfactory. First, under this rationale, the statutes are overbroad. They are not restricted, facially or as interpreted, to naked or unnecessary referral fees.239 Sec- ond, even naked referral fees can perform a beneficial function. Medi- cal economist Mark Pauly contends that referral fees counteract a gen- eral practitioner's temptation not to refer patients to specialists, and they induce the referring physician to search out the most efficient pro- vider-the physician who can afford to pay the most.240 s36 Cf Adams &amp; Klein, supra note 218, at 21 ("[T]his incentive exists in every instance where a provider or supplier administers any healthcare service ...."). 237 Another justification is the secrecy that tends to characterize referral fees. Re- ferral fees are often labelled kickbacks because, when disguised as compensation for services that are not actually needed such as "processing" and "interpreting" lab test results, they introduce a fraudulent or deceptive element. By contrast, the incentives inherent in traditional medical practice "are clearly visible to all concerned. . . . When patients have any doubts, they are free to seek other advice." Relman, supra note 235, at 750. These secrecy concerns do not justify outright prohibition of all forms of fee split- ting, particularly when the prohibition is enforced with the severity of felony punish- ment. Secrecy can be resolved by disclosing the conflict of interest; several states require disclosure from physicians who refer patients to institutions they own. See CAL Bus. &amp; PROF. CODE ? 654.2 (West Supp. 1988); WASH. REV. CODE ANN. ? 19.68.010 (1978). Criminalization of referral fees aggravates rather than solves the secrecy con- cern by creating the need to disguise the source or purpose of incentive fees. 238 See Relman, supra note 4, at 99. 239 See supra notes 203-09, 216-19 and accompanying text. 240 See Pauly, The Ethics and Economics of Kickbacks and Fee Splitting, 10 BELL J. ECON. 344, 347 (1979). This economic analysis of referral fees is particularly relevant to DRG incentive plans, given the prospective payment system's purpose of promoting market-like incentives. Hospitals that perform best under the DRG system will be able to pay their physicians the highest rewards, thereby directing patients to the more economical hospital. In the long run the government will benefit as well be-</page><page sequence="69">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 499 The third troubling aspect of the "necessary evil" justification for allowing only traditional payment methods to escape referral fee scru- tiny is that the medical profession elevates fee-for-service reimburse- ment to a virtue. Doctors view it as the ethical glue that binds them to their patients' interests; they vigorously attack any attempt to loosen that bind. But referral fees also encourage physicians to seek out bene- ficial forms of treatment. Thus, an element of hypocrisy exists in the profession's "unanimous, vitriolic condemnation of fee splitting" as un- ethically interfering with the physician's allegiance to the patient.241 The hypocrisy is heightened when the profession seizes on fee splitting statutes to attack the very arrangements that attempt to correct the nec- essary evils inherent in traditional reimbursement.242 It is as if the pa- tient racked with chronic pain were suddenly to become fastidious about the prick of the needle that injects the morphine. 2. The Rationale for Prohibiting Antireferral Fees The federal prohibition of hospital incentive plans evinces hypoc- risy of a different sort. Congress' perverse use of the referral fee con- cept to strike at antireferral fees flies directly in the face of its own cost- containment reimbursement policy.243 It is difficult to imagine more precipitous and poorly conceived legislation. Federal policymakers are operating under the misconception that we can save money without sac- rificing either the quality or the quantity of medical services delivered. cause overall treatment costs will be lower when it recalculates the average hospital costs on which prospective payments are based. 241 See Veatch, Ethical Dilemmas of For-Profit Enterprise in Health Care, in THE NEW HEALTH CARE FOR PROFIT, supra note 54, at 130. 242 The same point can be made concerning the state disclosure requirements im- posed on physicians who refer patients to institutions they own. See CAL Bus. &amp; PROF. CODE ? 654.2 (West Supp. 1988); WASH. REV. CODE ANN. ? 19.68.010 (West 1978). These restrictions are sensible in the traditional fee-for-service system where rendering more services leads to collecting more fees. Under the prospective payment system, however, it is counterproductive to discourage self-referrals because payment incentives reach physicians only if the physician is brought within the economics of the institution. Discouraging self-referrals therefore dampens the system's effects by insulating physi- cians from the incentives inherent in their own medical enterprises. Nonetheless, statutes rarely prohibit self-referrals outright. See supra note 232. The more common disclosure requirements do not substantially deter the functioning of such arrangements and they preserve the patient's interest in full awareness of the incentives that affect physicians' decisions. Therefore, disclosure requirements work an acceptable compromise between the need for organizational innovation and the need to protect patient autonomy. 243 Another paradoxical aspect of the statute is that it prohibits only positive fi- nancial incentives. See 42 U.S.C. ? 1320a-7a(b) (Supp. IV 1986) (prohibiting in part "payments .. .to reduce or limit services"(emphasis added)). It does not reach penal- ties for excessive services, even though this complementary form of financial inducement may have a stronger effect.</page><page sequence="70">500 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 Congress' action originated from the outrage with which the medi- cal profession greeted both the Paracelsus Hospital DRG incentive plan and the reports that a number of other hospitals were contemplat- ing similar action.244 Prodded by these complaints, the General Ac- counting Office issued an influential report that formed the basis for the legislation.245 The tone of the report is reflected in its title, Physi- cian Incentive Payments by Hospitals Could Lead to Abuse. The GAO concluded that "the possibility exists that physician incentive plans pro- vided by hospitals may give physicians too strong an incentive to . .. reduce to unacceptable levels the amount of care provided."246 Thus, Congress acted on entirely speculative and inchoate concerns. Not a shred of evidence existed that such plans actually lead to systemic abuse.247 Absent such documentation, the congressional response was over- broad and heavyhanded.248 HMOs were allowed a reasonable degree of 244 See AMA Judicial Council, Reports of the Judicial Council of the American Medical Association, 253 J.

No. 520]. 246 GAO REPORT, supra note 194, at 22 (emphasis added). 247 In fact, the GAO conceded that no one has "identified any quality of care problems that could be traced to the incentive plan at Paracelsus hospitals." Id. at 16; see also FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISES IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 162 ("[T]here is a paucity of data on the effects of these arrangements on medical decision making .... ."). The government has continued this reactionary response in its recent study of HMO incentive plans. The GAO has suggested that Congress "retain a ban on arrangments that closely link financial rewards with individual treatment decisions," despite acknowledging that it "could not identify any studies relating HMO physician incentives to the quality of care provided Medicare patients." GAO, PHYSICIAN INCEN- TIVE PLANS, supra note 192, at 3, 5. 248 It might be argued that Congress has not expressed its final opinion because it only intended to prevent these new arrangements while they were being studied. This is not an accurate reading of the legislation, however, which calls for further study of only HMO incentive plans. See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-509, ? 9313(c)(3), 100 Stat. 1874, 2003 (contained at 42 U.S.C. ? 1320a-7 note (Supp. IV 1986)). It is interesting to note that the same concerns Congress and the AMA expressed about hospital incentive plans were used to attack HMOs during the early 1970s when that new form of reimbursement started to become widespread, see Geist, Incentive Bonuses in Prepayment Plans, 291 NEW ENG. J. MED. 1306, 1308 (1974) ("The medical profession should lead in the attempt to amend federal and state laws so that payment of incentive-bonus rewards to physicians would be outlawed in prepayment plans ... ."), but HMO incentive plans have not led to systematic abuse after 15</page><page sequence="71">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 501 flexibility for productive experimentation during the developmental stage of their industry. They demonstrated that modest efficiency bo- nuses designed to counteract fee-for-service incentives are acceptable even if directed at individual physicians. Despite this encouraging evi- dence, Congress squeamishly compromised at the outset the fundamen- tal reimbursement reform recently introduced by the Medicare pro- gram. Hospital efficiency incentive plans, like HMO plans,249 strive to temper fee-for-service abuses by experimenting with the appropriate mix of quality and economy incentives during the formative period of prospective payment. In stifling this initiative, Congress was driven by a single-minded focus on weeding out any potential for lowering the quality of care. This bludgeoning of physician incentive plans entirely loses sight of Congress' established reimbursement policy that allows hospitals to profit based on their ability to reduce services. The insights of Professors Havighurst and Blumstein, who convincingly explained the inevitable tendency of quality concerns to undermine governmental cost containment programs, have been proven correct once again: "A policy . . . in which a taboo surrounds any concession to the reality of limited resources is bound to be rich in posturing and assertion" and impoverished in effect.260 Any reimbursement policy will have the potential to induce some form of abusive behavior. Traditional fee-for-service reimbursement suffers from the costs of overutilization, the harms of unnecessary treat- years of experience even though such plans also reward physicians in direct proportion to the services they limit. See P. FELDSTEIN, HEALTH CARE ECONOMICS 339-43 (2d ed. 1983) (presenting evidence on the performance of HMOs). Indeed, these incentive arrangements are viewed as vital to the HMO mode of operation, which is why the legislation does not apply to HMOs until the Secretary of Health and Human Services has conducted further study. See Pub. L. No. 99-509, ? 9313(c)(3), 100 Stat. 1874, 2003 (contained in 42 U.S.C. ? 1320a-7 note (Supp. IV 1986)); see also S. REP. No. 520, supra note 245, at 26 ("Incentive arrangements of this type [HMO] ... have been found to provide appropriate incentives for the delivery of cost-effective health care services."); H.R. REP. No. 727, supra note 210, at 444, reprinted in 1986 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; ADMIN. NEWS at 3841 (recognizing "that incentive arrangements are neces- sary to the operation of some types of HMOs . . . [and] that many of these arrange- ments pose no inherent threat to quality of care"). Indeed, given the congressional view of HMOs, it is highly unlikely that an absolute incentive prohibition will ever take effect for HMOs. Because efficiency incentive plans "go to the heart of how HMOs operate," a complete ban would destroy or radically alter the industry. Traska, Man- aged Care, HOSPITALS, May 5, 1987, at 52, 55. 249 A possible basis for distinguishing HMOs from hospitals is that HMO pa- tients are more aware of an HMO's emphasis on cost containment. See Stromberg, Physician Incentive Plans, HEALTH SPAN, Aug.-Sept. 1986, at 2, 2. There is less dis- parity, however, between hospitals and IPAs, the HMO type in which individual phy- sician incentive plans are most prevalent. See id.

We trust profes- sional ethics to hold these inflationary incentives in check, but ethics, coupled with peer pressure, the threat of malpractice liability, and com- petitive business forces, serve even more strongly to constrain health care providers from responding to deflationary pressures with excessive cuts in quality.251 These constraints will not necessarily work perfectly, but they do create some margin for error so that a rigidly prophylactic attitude such as that exhibited by Congress is not warranted. The extent to which these constraints will be effective is a question for empirical verification after a period of trial, and perhaps error. Even if oversight of incentive plans is ultimately required, the fee splitting concept is an extremely blunt and inexact tool for hammering out the fine ethical and policy distinctions required in this field.252 In sum, the government failed to see clearly through the medical profession's vitriolic barrage to the observation made recently by the prestigious Institute of Medicine: "All compensation systems[] . . . pre- sent some undesirable incentives for providing too many services, or too few. No system will work without some degree of integrity, decency, and ethical commitment on the part of professionals. Inevitably, we must presume some underlying professionalism that will constrain the operation of unadulterated self-interest."253 Ironically, doctors were successful in convincing Congress that they lack this "professionalism" sufficient to "constrain the operation of unadulterated self interest."254 3. Fee Splitting and Physician Autonomy The disingenuous nature of the medical profession's argument that doctors will run rampant if hospitals share some of their efficiency- generated savings suggests that the true source of its opposition lies elsewhere. The profession's real concern may be the effect these plans will have on physician autonomy. Doctors perceive that Medicare's 251 See generally Stromberg, supra note 249, at 2 (discussing remedies for risks in physician incentive plans). 252 See Adams &amp; Klein, supra note 218, at 22 ("[B]anning all arrangements that create economic incentives . . . is simply inconsistent with our basic economic system. It is throwing out the baby with the bathwater."). 253 FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 153. 254 Id. The medical profession's protests were particularly disingenuous because "[m]ost physicians . . . seem to claim that financial incentives do not influence their patient care decisions" in other contexts. Luft, supra note 184, at 108. It is also curious that doctors have mounted their campaign only against hospitals, leaving HMOs free, at least for the moment. One possibility is that the profession views its independent staff positions at hospitals as much more important to its eco- nomic well-being than its salaried positions at HMOs.</page><page sequence="73">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 503 payment system will lead to institutional control over their clinical deci- sions.255 Thus, preserving their professional sovereignty is likely a pri- mary motive for attacking DRG incentive plans. It is not accidental that physicians turn to the fee splitting concept to promote this interest. Fee splitting challenges have long been used to preserve economic and professional dominance. For example, referral fee prohibitions have been used to suppress competition by inhibiting both price discount- ing256 and physician advertising.257 The fee splitting prohibition laws have also prevented hospitals from placing doctors in a more sub- servient employee-type status by paying them to join the medical staff.258 These applications of the concept might be viewed as isolated or abusive, but subtle forms of hegemonic aggrandizement lie at the very core of fee splitting prohibitions. The rationale for prohibiting fee splitting rests on the preservation of a one-to-one relationship between services and payment (more graphically expressed as "you eat what you kill"). The unadulterated one-to-one relationship between work and pay preserves professional autonomy by protecting physicians from any financial influence other than that which they generate themselves. Fee-splitting laws thus embody the traditional values of solo, fee-for- service practice. The explicit statutory phrasing sometimes expressly prohibits payment for "professional services not actually and personally rendered."259 The one-to-one ethic is also quite explicit in the AMA House of Delegates' rationale for its condemnation of hospital incentive plans: "[P]hysicians are not entitled to derive a profit that results di- rectly or indirectly from service delivered by other health care providers 55260 255 See, e.g., Gregory, DRGs Part 1-How the Government Requires You to Im- pose Life-threatening Medical Restrictions, LEGAL ASPECTS MED.

Abortion Information Agency, 37 A.D.2d 142, 144, 330 N.Y.S.2d 927, 929 (1971) (A "discount . . . quite clearly is the equivalent of fee split- ting."), affd, 30 N.Y.2d 779, 285 N.E.2d 317, 334 N.Y.S.2d 174 (1972). 257 Cf. id. at 147, 330 N.Y.S.2d at 932 (Steuer, J., dissenting) (subjecting an abortion referral service to the physician fee splitting statute discourages the nationwide advertising of the service). 258 See Hall, supra note 219, at 624. Hospitals thus must compete for doctors by providing services such as newer and more sophisticated technological equipment, dis- counted office space, and other amenities that enhance professional prerogative. In con- trast, if hospitals could purchase medical staff membership, physicians would be re- duced to a more subservient employee-type status. Having bought out its physicians, the hospital might then demand exclusivity and impose more bureaucratic control. 259 Ky. REV. STAT. ANN. ? 311.595(18) (Michie/Bobbs-Merrill 1983); see also Wis.

The core rationale for prohibiting referral fees is to sanitize a physician's referral decision from any financial influ- ence. The law leaves unaffected a physician's financial stake in nonreferrals. Evident from this selective prohibition of only incentives to refer patients to other doctors is a preservation of individual physi- cian autonomy. Prohibiting antireferral fees is intended even more di- rectly to prevent financial constraints on medical judgment, the very constraints that are designed to counteract the self-referral incentives of traditional reimbursement. The professional autonomy motive for opposing efficiency incen- tives is short-sighted. Under prospective payment, hospitals must find some method to control physician behavior. The alternatives to finan- cial inducement are even more threatening to physician autonomy. Be- cause financial incentives are directed at the individual physician and do not attempt to control the specifics of clinical decisionmaking, ulti- mately these incentives may be the technique that is most consistent with professional values. IV. ORGANIZATIONAL REFORM OF MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS In contrast with the narrowly tailored control devices previously discussed such as financial incentive plans and treatment directives, or- ganizational reforms might hold more promise for bridging the chasm between institutional and physician interests.261 The internal structure 261 A rapidly growing body of literature explores a variety of prospects for hospi- tal reorganization.

A. The Need for Hospital Reorganization The hospital industry, marked by a much greater degree of uni- formity than other sectors of the economy,263 is particularly ripe for organizational innovation. It is dominated by the classic private sector model of a lay-controlled hospital board juxtaposed with an indepen- dent, self-governing medical staff. There is a critical need to integrate these two groups in order to bring physicians within the institution's economic framework. A survey of basic organization theory helps to understand why this is so.264 Unlike most organizations structured on bureaucratic, hierarchical lines of authority, the hospital is composed of several independent lines of authority-physicians, administrators, and owners-that lead to its graphic characterization as a "three-legged monster without a head."266 3, 44 (discussing the major forces influencing future relationships between administra- tors and physicians) [hereinafter Shortell, Replanting the Garden]; Shortell, supra note 223, at 73 (concluding that a shift toward more shared models of decisionmaking will become increasingly prevalent although not dominant); Sloan &amp; Becker, Internal Organization of Hospitals and Hospital Costs, 18 INQUIRY 224, 224 (1981) (question- ing whether key organizational variables affect costs and are worthy of consideration when analyzing hospital cost containment). 262 This is persuasively documented by comparing the performance of two basic organizational forms of HMOs, group HMOs and IPAs. IPAs, in contrast to group HMOs, are no more economical than fee-for-service practice. See F. WOLINSKY &amp; W. MARDER, THE ORGANIZATION OF MEDICAL PRACTICE AND THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE 144 (1985); Long, supra note 192, at 126; Redisch, supra note 155, at 227- 30; Sorenson, Saward &amp; Wersinger, The Demise of an Individual Practice Associa- tion: A Case Study of Health Watch, 17 INQUIRY 244, 249 (1980). A number of orga- nizational factors explain why IPAs have failed to perform as efficiently as group HMOs. Group HMOs are more cohesive because they contain fewer doctors and the doctors practice in the same office, thus enhancing peer influence. The physicians' sala- ried compensation removes fee-for-service distortions and their employment subjects them to more direct administrative oversight and control. 263 See, e.g., M. ROEMER &amp; J. FRIEDMAN, supra note 30, at 33-39 (noting the standardization movement that has characterized the hospital industry in the 20th century). 264 Organizational theorists have produced a stimulating body of literature at- tempting to formulate a coherent model of the internal structure of hospitals that predicts and explains traditional hospital behavior. See, e.g., Jacobs, A Survey of Eco- nomic Models of Hospitals, 11 INQUIRY 83, 83-84 (1974) (dividing theorists between those who favor "organism models" and those who favor "exchange models"); Saltman &amp; Young, supra note 3, at 396-403 (using Crozier's political theory of "conflictive equilibrium" to analyze the power relationship between physicians and administrators). 265 See Smith, Two Lines of Authority Are One Too Many, MOD. HOSP., Mar.</page><page sequence="76">506 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 Consequently, one must use nonhierarchical models for institutional control to understand the functioning of hospitals. The most successful is an "exchange" or "equilibrium" model, in which the hospital's vari- ous authority centers compete for control of separate domains of activity within the organization.266 While there are various accounts of where the equilibrium settles among the competing groups,267 theorists agree that physicians exercise unfettered control over all medical matters.268 As economist Jeffrey Harris developed in his seminal article,269 a hos- pital is, in essence, composed of two separate firms: (1) the medical staff, which controls the treatment demand function, and (2) the hospi- tal administration, which controls the facility supply function. Histori- cally, the supply side of hospitals has been completely responsive to the demand side, providing whatever support and equipment physicians de- sire. Thus, "the hospital's dual line of authority may be seen as a 'structural mechanism for assuring that managerial-economic criteria of efficiency remain[] subordinate to clinical criteria of efficiency in pa- tient care.' "270 One would expect the resulting lack of integration in function, utility, and authority to undermine the institution. In the past, it has not because the interests of doctors and hospitals traditionally have been directed along parallel, if not congruent, paths. Under fee-for-service or cost-based reimbursement, they each benefitted from increased produc- 1955, at 59, 60; B. TEMPLE, E. LENTZ &amp; R. WILSON, THE GIVE AND TAKE IN HOS- PITALS 37, 83 (1956) (noting the conflicting interests of trustees, administrators, and physicians within the hospital organization). 266 See Jacobs, supra note 264, at 83-84, 96. In symmetrical counterpoint to eco- nomic theories of political behavior, organization science is thus developing political theories of economic behavior to help understand the functioning of complex institu- tions such as hospitals. See Saltman &amp; Young, supra note 3, at 398. 267 Many theorists point to physicians as the controlling group. See, e.g., Pauly &amp; Redisch, The Not-for-Profit Hospital as a Physicians' Cooperative, 63 AM. ECON. REV. 87, 87-90 (1973) (focusing on physicians' de facto control of hospitals); see also P. FELDSTEIN, HEALTH CARE ECONOMICS 219-23 (2d ed. 1983) (explaining the physi- cian-control model of hospital organization theory); Saltman &amp; Young, supra note 3, at 398, 404-05 (analyzing theories which contend that physicians control both medical and financial decisions within the hospital). Others see greater administration/director power, particularly over fiscal matters. See, e.g., Lee, A Conspicuous Production The- ory of Hospital Behavior, S. ECON. J. 38, 48-58 (1971), quoted in Saltman &amp; Young, supra note 3, at 398 (focusing upon administrator's control over the personal financial interests of the members of the hospital community). 268 See Jacobs, supra note 264, at 83; Saltman &amp; Young, supra note 3, at 407-08. 269 Harris, supra note 47, at 467. 270 Begun, Managing with Professionals in a Changing Health Care Environ- ment, 42 MED.

This schismatic structure is reflected in the strict division in billing for physician services separately from hospital services that persists throughout all forms of public and private reimbursement.</page><page sequence="77">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 507 tion.271 Thus, until now, growth of the facility has been the salve for potential hospital/physician conflict. Prospective payment, however, transforms this relationship into a potentially explosive one. Doctors and hospitals now face diametrically opposed incentives: doctors con- tinue under open-ended reimbursement, while hospitals are subject to fiscal restraint.272 Disappearance of the fee-for-service reimbursement that has accommodated the anomalies of hospital organization requires a dramatic27 realignment of the existing power equilibrium. The pro- fession's grip on the internal organization of hospitals must be broken in order for cost containment to succeed. B. Physician Employment and the Corporate Practice of Medicine 1. The Advantages of Physician Employment The most obvious organizational alternative to the traditional in- dependence of doctors is for medical institutions to restrict physician membership to a small core of doctors who practice exclusively at the institution, either as employees or independent contractors. Under both arrangements, doctors would be closely integrated into the hierarchical structure of the firm. Physician employment (or its organizational equivalent) potentially activates a number of controlling forces,274 many 271 Doctors desire state-of-the-art technology, ample support services, and com- fortable accommodations. It is in the hospital's interest to please doctors because physi- cian satisfaction leads to an increased number of patients (customers). Enhanced facili- ties do not go unused because physicians are in a position, encouraged by hospital management, to find new uses for expanded capacity. Cf P. FELDSTEIN, supra note 267, at 220-21 (noting that physicians sustain increases in hospital capacity, invest- ment, and support services). 272 See id. In other words, the traditional hospital structure contains a sharp divi- sion in perspective. Hospital administration is concerned with macro allocation issues of the costs of supplying medical care while, on the demand side, physicians are concerned with micro allocation issues of individual patient needs. Under open-ended, cost-plus reimbursement, this dimensional incongruity created no problems because what the physicians demanded, the hospital was eager to supply. Now, under closed-ended reim- bursement systems, the costs of medical decisions are internalized on the supply side (the hospital) but they are not so on the demand side (the doctor). 273 One proposal that has received the endorsement of the three dominant health care associations (the AMA, AHA, and JCAH) is to increase physician participation in hospital decisionmaking by integrating physicians into the institution's governing struc- ture. See Alexander, Morrisey &amp; Shortell, Physician Participation in the Administra- tion and Governance of System and Freestanding Hospitals: A Comparison by Type of Ownership, in FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 402. Physician governance, however, is largely a fine-tuning effort that does not appear to have potential for sparking fundamental change. 274 See Glandon &amp; Morrisey, supra note 225, at 172 ("As an employer, a hospital has direct control and responsibility for how physicians utilize the hospital's resources when treating patients."); Omenn &amp; Conrad, supra note 65, at 1316 ("Clinical guide- lines for the length of stay or for the intensity of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic</page><page sequence="78">508 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 of which do not entail direct control over clinical discretion. As group HMOs' command of physician working hours illustrates, the firm can induce more economical treatment by scheduling more patient visits into a physician's day.275 Exclusive arrangements with physicians en- hance other management strategies, such as education, feedback, and peer review, by concentrating these efforts on fewer individuals. Fur- thermore, eliminating physicians' power to withdraw their practice greatly strengthens the institution's authority: physicians are much more amenable to advice and direction when they have no alternative place to treat their patients.276 Finally, the terms of service can be ar- ranged in a variety of ways to induce cost consciousness.277 Based on this research data and organizational theory, "[m]any observers of the medical care scene have concluded that the physician's independence needs to be subordinated to organizational controls in the interests of improved quality and efficiency of medical care."278 In fact, the hospital industry appears to be moving strongly in this direction already.279 Large numbers of hospital-based specialists such as radiolo- services are easier to enforce when hospitals have explicit contractual agreements with physicians."). 275 Wolinsky and his associates have demonstrated a broad connection within the HMO industry between the degree of structural integration inherent in various HMO models and the ability to control physician behavior. On Wolinsky's continuum of hier- archical models, patient visits consistently tend to shorten as the organization becomes more bureaucratic and less autonomous. See F. WOLINSKY &amp; W. MARDER, supra note 262, at 41, 139. In a similar study within the hospital industry, Roemer and Friedman found that hospitals with more highly structured medical staffs tend to have fewer ex- penditures per patient day. See M. ROEMER &amp; J. FRIEDMAN, supra note 30, at 255- 57. Finally, Sloan and Becker found lower costs per patient-day and per admission at hospitals with a large number of ancillary specialists employed or under contract. See Sloan &amp; Becker, supra note 261, at 236. Notably, this association did not depend on the form of compensation; it existed even under compensation arrangements such as fee for service that might produce inflationary incentives. See id. 276 See FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 174 (dis- cussing trend toward physicians being identified with a single hospital); see also D. YOUNG &amp; R. SALTMAN, supra note 169, at 124 (noting the power that physicians wield owing to their power to withdraw their patients from a hospital). 277 The possible compensation arrangements include salary, flat fees per patient (capitation), bonuses, penalties, and percentage of profits. See supra notes 186-202 and accompanying text. 278 Scott, supra note 72, at 224; see also P. STARR, supra note 30, at 147 (finding that hospital administration in the United States is complicated by the decentralized system in which physicians, who are not hospital employees, follow their patients into hospitals and make vital decisions concerning their care). 279 Medicine appears to be following the "strong trend in favor of the numerical ascendancy of the salaried professions." W. KORNHAUSER, supra note 110, at 5. "Al- ready almost 50 percent of all physicians are salaried; even excluding house officers, almost 40 percent of physicians work for a salary. In the absence of any kind of profes- sional self-regulation, that percentage will continue to grow."

The Corporate Practice of Medicine Doctrine Past predictions of the demise of physician independence have re- peatedly proven wrong primarily because of the law's longstanding prohibition of the employment of physicians in the corporate practice of medicine.282 This doctrine reasons that corporate employment of physi- cians is illegal because the acts of practicing employees are attributable 280 See, e.g., Morrisey, Alexander &amp; Shortell, Medical Staff Size, Hospital Privi- leges, and Compensation Arrangements: A Comparison of System Hospitals, in FOR- PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 429-30 (analyzing hospital relationships with radiologists and anesthesiologists in terms of salary, fee for service, or percent of revenue arrangements); Scott &amp; Lammers, Trends in Occupations in the Medical Care and Mental Health Sectors, 42 MED. CARE REV. 37, 62 (1985) (noting that over half the active physicians in the United States as of 1980 are salaried employ- ees). However, the form of compensation typically used for hospital-based physi- cians-fee for service or percentage of revenues-retains inflationary incentives. Only about 10 percent of such physicians are paid in a form, such as salary, that rewards efficiency or eliminates inflationary incentives. See id. 281 See FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 172 (not- ing an increase in employment and employment-like contracts); Johnson, An Emerging Medical Staff Organization, HosP. ADMIN., Winter 1972, at 26, 83 (predicting the replacement of direct patient billing by physicians with some contractual relationship between hospital and physician, owing to increases in super-specialization and the in- volvement of several physicians in medical routines); Scott, supra note 72, at 223-24 (noting an emphasis on organizational arrangements supporting a well-defined division of labor). But see Glandon &amp; Morrisey, supra note 225, at 174 ("In our judgment, the employer-employee relationship will not be used by many hospitals."). 282 See, e.g., Garcia v.

The doctrine has a long history of suppressing needed innovation in times of industry upheaval. During the 1930s, when prepaid group practices (now known as HMOs) were being developed in response to severe gaps in insurance coverage, the corporate practice doctrine was a major obstacle that took decades to remove.286 During the 1950s, when hospitals felt an increasing need to employ hospital-based specialists in response to the technological transformation of medical care, a number of state attorney general opinions struck down their initiatives.287 Dur- ing the 1990s, there will be tremendous pressure to search for more cost conscious organizational forms and relationships. These changes will raise combined threats of commercialization and professional subordi- nation, concerns that will be a powerful stimulus to professional oppo- sition.288 This opposition will surely invoke the corporate practice doc- 283 See, e.g., Rockett, 287 S.W.2d at 192.

Little more can be expected in today's climate of change and experimentation. Therefore, as fair warning for the next decade and beyond, this Article will attempt to explain the mystery of the doc- trine's survival throughout the 20th century and its adverse impact on current organizational relationships. a. Corporate Practice as Unlicensed Practice The only satisfactory way to make sense of the corporate practice doctrine is to recognize that it is composed of two entirely distinct branches, one whose foundation is statutory and the other common law. As a statutory doctrine, it merely applies ordinary respondeat superior principles to a violation of the medical practice act by holding a corpo- ration responsible for the acts of unauthorized practice committed by its agents.291 A corporation whose lay administrators control the treatment decisions of its doctors is engaged in unlicensed practice. But this is not because of the employment of doctors simpliciter or the mere potential for lay influence. The statutory-based doctrine should apply only when the actual conduct of lay employees constitutes the practice of medicine,292 and its only effect should be to extend responsibility for the 289 Instances in which the doctrine has been recently invoked are documented in Rosoff, supra note 284, at 497-99; Note, supra note 284, at 471-74; see also United Calendar Mfg.

App. 14, 19-21, 737 P.2d 1030, 1033-34 (1987) (sustaining corpo- rate practice challenge to a medical clinic organized as a limited partnership). Even if the doctrine exists only nominally, it will still continue to exert a powerful influence on the willingness of institutions to experiment with organizational change.

It is irrelevant that a corporation is ineligible for a medical license. The licensure status of the corporation's employees determines the legality of its undertakings. Instead of proceeding in this straightforward fashion, however, courts have given the doctrine substantive scope that entirely loses sight of the limited respondeat superior focus of its statutory origins. In do- ing so, courts engage in an astonishing series of fallacies. A blatant example of this faulty reasoning is the illogical way it attributes human characteristics to a corporation. I call this the anthropomorphic fallacy. Courts usually phrase the corporate practice argument in the fol- lowing fashion: Corporations cannot possibly qualify for a medical li- cense because the applicant must demonstrate moral character and pro- fessional competence. Corporations, of course, do not have a moral character, cannot attend medical school, and cannot be tested.293 This argument addresses only half of the issue, however. If the moral char- acter and exam taking activities of corporate employees cannot be at- tributed to the corporate entity, then logically corporations cannot en- gage in the physical acts of medical practice as well. Conversely, if employees' practice activities are attributable to the corporation, the li- censure qualifications and status of those who perform the activity must also be attributable to it.294 The corporate practice doctrine totally con- 390, 44 Cal. Rptr. 572, 580 (1965) (rejecting the corporate practice charge because "it appears that the doctors retain their freedom of action"); cf. Hyde v. Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2, 513 F. Supp. 532, 540, 546 (E.D. La. 1981) (rejecting an unautho- rized practice challenge to a hospital's exclusive arrangement with a group of anesthesi- ologists because "the hospital did not improperly engage in the diagnosis and treatment of patients"), rev'd on other grounds, 686 F.2d 286 (5th Cir. 1982), rev'd on other grounds, 466 U.S. 2 (1983). 293 See Dr. Allison, Dentist, Inc. v. Allison, 360 Ill. 638, 641-42, 196 N.E. 799, 800 (1935). There, the court noted, [Medical practice] can be done only by a duly qualified human being, and to qualify something more than mere knowledge or skill is essential. The qualifications include personal characteristics such as honesty, guided by an upright conscience and a sense of loyalty to clients or patients . ... These requirements are spoken of generically as that good moral character which is a prerequisite to the licensing of any professional man. No corpo- ration can qualify. It can have neither honesty nor conscience ... Id. 294 Considering the identical arguments in a different licensing context exposes the absurdity of the corporate practice doctrine: 1. The actions of drivers hired by a corporation are attributed to the corporation. 2. An eye sight examination is required for a driver's license. 3. Corporations cannot take an eye exam. 4. Therefore, a corporation that hires drivers is guilty of driving without a license. See Sloan v. Metropolitan Health Council of Indianapolis., Inc., 516 N.E.2d 1104,</page><page sequence="83">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 513 founds this attribution question, however, by holding one way for the status of licensure and the other for the physical acts of practice.295 The best demonstration of this absurdity is that, if this anthropomorphic logic were followed consistently in all licensure contexts, hospitals could not hire nurses, barber shops could not hire barbers, and architecture firms could not hire architects.296 Even more astounding than the continued judicial acceptance of this flawed reasoning is that the unqualified condemnation of the cor- porate practice of medicine flies in the face of numerous orthodox forms of corporate practice that are central to our health care delivery system. Under the doctrine, (1) teaching hospitals and prestigious research in- stitutions could not hire practicing medical academics and scientists; (2) federal veterans or Indian hospitals, state mental hospitals, and munici- 1108 (Ind. Ct. App. 1987) ("It is ... a non sequitur to conclude that because a hospital cannot practice medicine . .., it cannot be liable for the actions of its employed agents and servants who may be so licensed. Similar logic would dictate that a city cannot be liable for the negligence of its employees in driving automobiles since the city cannot hold a driver's license ...."). 2" The theory of statutory illegality states that the medical practice act prohibits any person from engaging in the unlicensed practice of medicine but allows only natu- ral persons to obtain a license. This argument gives two different meanings to the word person in a tightly knit statutory scheme. The term "person" in the disabling portion of the act includes corporations, but it excludes corporations in the enabling portion of the act. See, e.g., People v. John H. Woodbury Dermatological Inst., 192 N.Y. 454, 456- 57, 85 N.E. 697, 698-99 (1908) (the word "person" includes any corporation not au- thorized to practice medicine). But see Bartron v. Codington County, 68 S.D. 309, 320, 2 N.W.2d 337, 342 (1942) (corporation not within the meaning of the term "person" in statute prohibiting the practice of medicine without a license). See generally Willcox, supra note 287, at 437-41 (analyzing the confusion surrounding the various interpreta- tions of "person"). 298 Hospital malpractice cases also flatly refute the corporate practice theory. The doctrine's analytical foundation is that the medical acts of employed physicians are at- tributable to the corporation; its policy foundation is that the employment of physicians subjects them to the control of lay owners and administrators. Hospital liability cases, however, have stated that a hospital is "powerless, under the law, to command or forbid any act by [physicians] in the practice of their profession." Rosane v. Senger, 112 Colo. 363, 366, 149 P.2d 372, 374 (1944); see, e.g., Brown v. St. Vincent's Hosp., 222 A.D. 402, 403, 226 N.Y.S. 317, 320 (1928) (A hospital "does not contract to heal or attempt to heal a patient through the agency of others."); Adamski v. Tacoma Gen. Hosp., 20 Wash. App. 98, 107, 579 P.2d 970, 975 (1978) ("[T]he governing body of a hospital never actually exercises, nor can it exercise, much control over a physician's medical decisions and his actual treatment of patients, even when he is clearly an employee of the hospital ...."). The early cases reason that the negligence of employed physicians is not attributed to hospitals because hospitals exercise no control over physicians' ac- tions. Modern hospital liability cases do hold a hospital responsible for the negligence of employed physicians, see Bing v. Thunig, 2 N.Y.2d 656, 665-67, 143 N.E.2d 3, 8-9, 163 N.Y.S.2d 3, 10-12 (1957), but they do so despite this lack of control. See supra notes 266-70 and accompanying text. Thus, the logic of both lines of cases is diametri- cally opposed to the corporate practice theory. See Sloan, 516 N.E.2d at 1108-09 (find- ing corporate practice doctrine inapplicable to HMO in order to hold it liable for negli- gence of employed physician).</page><page sequence="84">514 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 pal general hospitals could not employ their medical staffs; (3) hospitals could not retain hospital-based specialists (radiologists, pathologists, and anesthesiologists); (4) hospitals could not employ residents and in- terns; and (5) corporations could not engage "company doctors" to treat industry employees. Of course, all the above are conspicuous parts of our health care system.297 Therefore, despite the doctrine's broad sweep, the corporate practice prohibition has been used selectively to attack only those organizational forms that are unconventional and threatening to established practice formats.298 b. Corporate Practice as Contrary to Public Policy Most courts, recognizing the difficulty of supporting the broad cor- porate practice prohibition with a formal statutory analysis, buttress the doctrine with a series of policy arguments:299 (1) corporate practice will subject corporate-employed physicians to lay control in the practice of their profession; (2) corporate practice tends to commercialize the profession; and (3) corporate practice divides the doctor's loyalty and thus interferes with the physician/patient relationship.300 However, these courts fail to recognize that these policy arguments create an en- tirely distinct branch of the doctrine governed by distinct principles and policies not found in any statute. Because the basis of this branch of the doctrine is wholly court-created, judges should be circumspect in its ap- plication. The absolutism that characterizes judicial management of the doctrine31 is entirely inappropriate. The common law branch needs 297 See, e.g., Laufer, supra note 286, at 522 (noting the existence of the first and fifth practices); Willcox, supra note 287, at 460-65 (noting the existence of all five practices); Note, supra note 286, at 349 (first and fifth practices). 298 See, e.g., Stuart Circle Hosp. Corp. v. Curry, 173 Va. 136, 146, 3 S.E.2d 153, 157 (1939) (allowing a hospital corporation to practice, but only to the extent "as is customary and necessary in the proper conduct of its business"); Cal. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 81-1004 (April 7, 1982) (refusing to allow the operation of an "industrial medical corporation" because it "is not an institution which is traditionally thought of as being within the health care delivery system as are hospitals and clinics"); Willcox, supra note 287, at 486 n.168 (noting the "genuine if unanalytical belief that . . .accepted practices are not illegal"). 299 Courts rarely rest their reasoning solely on policy grounds. "[T]he rule seems to result from a blending of several lines of thought which are often so interwoven in a single opinion that it is difficult to know where one ends and another begins."

When courts enforce the corporate practice doctrine, they mistak- enly suppose they are enforcing the legislature's public protection polices when in fact they are enforcing the profession's economic pro- tection policies. The policies of preventing lay interference, commercial- ization, and divided loyalty, however important, do not underlie the medical practice act.303 Rather, the enumerated policies are based on professional ethics. Until enjoined by the Federal Trade Commission, the AMA vigilantly cited corporate practice as an ethical violation.304 The medical profession's driving concern was to protect solo, fee-for- service practice, the traditional format that preserves financial indepen- dence and professional autonomy.305 The doctrine's policies against lay control and divided loyalties protect physician independence. The policy against commercialization prevents others from participating in the profits from medical practice, and "ensure[s] that hospitals will not be able to compete with physicians."306 A lone exemplary instance of a more measured approach is found in N.M. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-39 (July 30, 1987): In the absence of an express statutory answer to the question posed, we conclude that, unless prohibited by statute or by public policy considera- tions against lay control of MEDICAL judgment and lay exploitation of the practice of medicine, corporations organized and controlled by non- physicians may provide MEDICAL services to the public through em- ployed physicians. Id. 302 The analyses that are used in testing the validity of covenants not to compete and those used in appying the rule of reason to antitrust issues serve as possible models. 303 The concerns of the medical practice act are prevention of incompetent practice and avoidance of public misrepresentation of credentials and qualifications. Both con- cerns are met if a corporation hires only licensed physicians. See Davies, Freyfogle &amp; Richardson, supra note 291, at 132; Willcox, supra note 287, at 445; Note, supra note 286, at 348. 304 See In re American Medical Ass'n, 94 F.T.C. 701, 897, 1016 (1979) (finding that the AMA engaged in unfair trade practice by publishing and circulating a direc- tive not to approve any contract for services "whose terms or conditions are inconsistent with the [AMA] Principles of Medical Ethics"). 30o See Willcox, supra note 287, at 446 &amp; n.35 ("We know of no suggestion that [lay] interference . . . has been a problem.

This same attitude underlies the bankrupt belief that society can support all treatment that produces any medical benefit, re- gardless of cost.308 Insisting on the fiscal purity of treatment decisions ignores the financial incentives inherent in the fee-for-service method of payment and the astonishing health care inflation those incentives have caused. The commercialization charge is thus the most ill-considered of the corporate practice doctrine's policies.309 It disregards the fundamen- tal causes of the health care spending crisis and blocks the reforms needed to produce more responsive medical organizations. 3. Corporate Practice in the Modern Context The primary task of the corporate practice doctrine should be to hold corporations responsible for their lay employees' acts of unlicensed practice. Beyond this, there is a limited scope of operation for the dis- parties); Note, supra note 284, at 476-77 (AMA's ethical restraints "restricted ar- rangements between physicians and non-physicians and . . prevented the creation of more economical business structures."). 307 See, e.g., N.M. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 87-39 (July 30, 1987) ("Many of the earlier decisions in this area may not be germane to the health care environment today. A market demand for integrated health care delivery has emerged in recent years ... These market forces may redound to the benefit of consumers of health care."). 308 See supra notes 5 &amp; 6. 309 The other policies supporting the prohibition of corporate practice are also logically inconsistent. The concern over interference with the physician-patient rela- tionship, for instance, is entirely at odds with the rampant specialization that has be- come dominant under the modern team approach to medical treatment. A hospitalized surgery patient may be treated by a half dozen doctors in addition to her general practi- tioner. "The patient treated in [the modern hospital] receives care from a number of individuals of varying capacities and [is] not merely treated by a physician acting in isolation. The patient relies upon the effectiveness of this 'highly integrated system of activities' . . ." Elam v. College Park Hosp., 132 Cal. App. 3d 332, 344, 183 Cal. Rptr. 156, 163 (1982) (citation omitted) (quoting Ybarra v. Spangard, 25 Cal. 2d 486, 493, 154 P.2d 687, 691 (1944)). Owing to the technological advances in medical sci- ence, hospitals often restrict doctors to the practice areas in their field of expertise. Requiring referral to specialists for surgery and complications, and requiring the use of hospital-based radiologists, pathologists, and anesthesiologists interferes with the pri- mary doctor-patient relationship to a far greater degree than simple employment. In- deed, employment may enhance a physician's attention to her patient's needs because she is relieved from the burdens of practice administration. Moreover, the concern that an employed physician's loyalty to the patient will be diverted by the physician's concurrent loyalty to the employer is disingenuous. Physi- cians who practice in partnerships also have competing loyalties to their partners. Even solo practitioners have overlapping loyalties to their other patients. If physicians are able to serve two masters in these contexts, it is difficult to see any uniquely troubling concern in the employment context.</page><page sequence="87">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 517 tinctly different branch of the doctrine that enforces certain public pol- icy considerations. Like other common law doctrines used to circum- scribe freedom of contract, however, the terrain is narrow and must be carefully traversed. Courts should not prohibit arrangements if there is a mere potential for abuse; they should prohibit only those arrange- ments that are demonstrably harmful. Regrettably, there is no indication that the courts will begin to confine the doctrine to its proper boundaries. Courts continue to apply corporate practice prohibitions in the broadest possible terms and create only limited, ad hoc exceptions to reconcile the doctrine's reach with the realities of the conventional health care industry. For instance, courts have crafted specific exemptions to address prominent instances of phy- sician employment by hospitals and HMOs.310 Although these numer- ous special exemptions conform to established industry practices, they do not adequately confine the doctrine in a time of tremendous change and upheaval such as the present because their ad hoc nature prevents their extension to novel arrangements.31 Allowing non-profit organiza- tions to employ doctors does not assist the for-profit organizations pro- liferating in today's health care environment. Allowing the employment of interns or hospital-based physicians does not protect the hospital that wants to employ its entire medical staff; nor may a hospital safely structure an independent contractor relationship with its medical staff, an innovation widely proposed in the hospital management litera- 810 For example, some courts distinguish between employed physicians and inde- pendent contractors. See Willcox, supra note 287, at 453. But see People ex rel. State Bd. of Medical Examiners v. Pacific Health Corp., 12 Cal. 2d 156, 159, 82 P.2d 429, 430 (1938) (stating "it is immaterial whether the appointed practitioners are termed employees, agents, or appointees of the [health corporation]"). An exception for non- profit entities is more frequently encountered, particularly in California decisions. See Complete Serv. Bureau v. San Diego County Medical Soc'y, 43 Cal. 2d 201, 209, 272 P.2d 497, 501 (1954); Pacific Health Corp., 12 Cal. 2d at 160, 82 P.2d at 431; see also Willcox, supra note 287, at 459, 466 (nonprofit, philanthropic associations may employ licensed physicians to render medical services to their members); Special Project, supra note 286, at 961-62 (courts distinguish between profit and nonprofit plans, holding the latter valid under the corporate practice rule). Courts apply another exemption for apprenticing physicians, such as interns and residents, reasoning that this class of phy- sicians does not have a direct relationship with their patients. See Rush v. Akron Gen. Hosp., 171 N.E.2d 378, 380 (Ohio Ct. App. 1957). In New York, courts have found in hospital enabling acts implicit authority for hospital corporations to employ physicians. See Albany Medical College v. McShane, 66 N.Y.2d 982, 983, 489 N.E.2d 1278, 1279, 499 N.Y.S.2d 376, 377 (1985). Similarly, courts exempt HMOs based on either ex- plicit or implicit language in their state enabling acts. See California Physicians' Serv. v. Garrison, 155 P.2d 885, 891-92 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1945), affd, 28 Cal. 2d 790, 172 P.2d 4 (1946) (en banc); GA. CODE ANN. ? 33-21-28 (1985); ILL. ANN.

As a result, the corporate practice doctrine has a tremendous sti- fling effect. Even though the instances of its exceptions outnumber its applications, its philosophy is deeply ingrained in the health care estab- lishment in a way that pervasively affects the subliminal workings of intra-industry relationships.34 C. Efficiency Criteria in Physician Staffing Perhaps the strongest tool to achieve institutional cost control is for hospitals to penalize inefficiency by denying physicians access to a practice setting. Just as HMOs screen employees for conservative treat- ment styles, hospitals can begin to consider physician frugality in the process of awarding and renewing medical staff membership. Tradi- tionally, hospitals have based their granting of admitting privileges only on quality-of-care considerations.315 A significant number of hospitals, however, will soon begin to review physician efficiency as well during the credentialing process.316 312 See, e.g., Veatch, supra note 241, at 132 (evolution of for-profit enterprise in health care presents numerous new forms of physician participation); cf. FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISE IN HEALTH CARE, supra note 34, at 174-75 (citing statistics showing rapid growth of hospitals hiring physicians as employees and contractors). 313 See 42 U.S.C. ? 300e-10a (1982); GA. CODE ANN. ? 33-21-28 (1982). 314 According to recent empirical work, state restrictions on the corporate employ- ment of physicians, ambiguous or not, hinder the growth of HMOs more than any other state regulation. See Welch, supra note 289, at 754-55. 316 See, e.g., Note, Medical Staff Membership Decisions: Judicial Intervention, 1985 U. ILL. L.

Either form of controlling access to practice offers the hospital powerful leverage for changing physician behav- ior.318 Medical staff selection presents "virtually [the] only opportunity [for the hospital] to exercise direct control over independent practition- ers."319 American hospitals are uniquely situated to exercise this influ- ence pervasively because only in North America does the bulk of the profession practice in hospitals.320 The first reported use of a hospital program to monitor economic performance produced striking results. When efficiency screens were initially applied to physicians at Harford Memorial Hospital in Mary- land, nine of 140 exceeded the criteria by more than fifteen percent. After the first year, only three were seriously out of compliance and only one of those had not shown dramatic improvement. During that year, the average length of stay for patients of the highest utilizers at Harford dropped from twenty-nine percent above to eleven percent be- low the statewide norm.321 1. The Case Against Efficiency-Based Selection The determinitive legal question is whether physician exclusion decisions will survive judicial scrutiny if they are based on the institu- tion's judgment of when the costs of admittedly beneficial care are ex- cessive. Past experience counsels extreme care in treading on physi- cians' economic turf. The law has displayed uncommon solicitude toward physicians refused medical staff privileges by nurturing the about six months before privileges to perform certain treatments are reviewed"). 317 See Egdahl &amp; Taft, supra note 192, at 60 (exclusion from Medicare program represents ultimate sanction); Sigmond, The Notion of Hospital Incentives, in HEALTH SERVICES MANAGEMENT: READINGS AND COMMENTARY 254, 258 (A. Kovner &amp; D. Neuhauser eds. 1978) (a practicing physician needs hospital privileges). 318 Selectivity of medical staff is the technique that probably best accounts for HMO success. See Meier &amp; Tillotson, supra note 192, at 53-54, 73-75. Physicians who favor conservative treatment naturally tend to select a compatible practice environ- ment, and HMOs screen physicians with the same philosophy in mind. See Luft, supra note 176, at 512. 319 Havighurst, supra note 93, at 1075 n.12 ("A hospital lacking freedom to hire and fire . . on a discretionary basis is reduced to using persuasion as a managerial device."). 320 Elsewhere, the European model prevails, in which only a select group of spe- cialists maintain a hospital practice.

In order to foster vigorous peer supervision, the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986330 immunizes creden- tialing decisions from state and federal laws if the decisions are prop- erly rendered "in the reasonable belief that the action was in the fur- therance of quality health care."33' This legislation addresses only the quality aspect of privileges review, however. It adamantly excludes pro- tection for any consideration other than "conduct [that] affects or could affect adversely the health or welfare of a patient."332 Therefore, it 326 JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATION OF HOSPITALS, ACCREDITATION MANUAL FOR HOSPITALS 1988, at 112, 119 (1987) [hereinafter "JCAH ACCREDITA- TION MANUAL"]. s27 See, e.g., CAL.

The Case in Favor of Efficiency Criteria The law's past emphasis on quality considerations in physician staffing decisions is an artifact of the industry's own quality fetish.335 Now that hospitals are beginning for the first time to incorporate cost considerations in their business decisions, the validity of efficiency crite- ria must be examined de novo.336 Fortunately, this issue does not have to be addressed in a policy bell jar evacuated of precedent. A closer reading of the established case law reveals a number of strong bases for including cost considerations in the credentialing process. The case law does not mandate quality as the touchstone for all privileges decisions. The established judicial standard broadly allows criteria related to "sound hospital standards" and "in furtherance of the common good."337 Moreover, the JCAH standard does not mean to 3ss Havighurst, Professional Peer Review and the Antitrust Laws, 36 CASE W. RES. L. REV. 1117, 1162 (1986). S34 Congress failed to realize that efficiency-based privileges decisions merit the same protection as quality decisions. The cost crisis in health care is of a proportion that at least equals the malpractice crisis. More fundamentally, the malpractice crisis is itself a cost crisis caused by the insurance industry sharply increasing premiums, thus fueling medical inflation. See Nelson, Medical Malpractice and the Transformation in Health Care Delivery, 17 CUMB. L. REV. 313, 313 (1987). Physician reaction to the crisis mentality is to practice defensively, resulting in more expenditures. The federal government's solution is an indirect one. It attempts to suppress these reactions by fos- tering heightened scrutiny of physician quality. Congress ignored the opportunity to strike directly at health care costs by fostering heightened efficiency monitoring.

Courts scrutinize economic factors because of the danger that existing staff physicians will use their influence over hospital access to harm their competitors.342 Hospitals that screen for inefficient physicians, however, promote rather than retard the goals of competition. Hospitals should be free, then, to act out of their own economic interest, particularly when that interest is congruent with the public interest.343 This princi- ple is established by cases that sustain hospital requirements that staff members maintain a certain level of malpractice insurance coverage.

The case law remains firmly grounded in quality concerns; no case cleanly supports the exclusion of physicians because of factors wholly unrelated to quality of care, much less opposed to quality.349 Courts justify exclusive radiology and anes- thesiology contracts because of their ability to enhance training and su- pervision.360 Membership refusals based on overcrowding are "moti- vated by the Trustees' unwillingness to permit the quality of patient care . .. to deteriorate-an occurrence they deem[] inevitable if the facility were overtaxed by additional surgical cases."361 Even those de- cisions that appear to rely most squarely on physician overutilization ultimately fall back on quality of care concerns such as the harms caused by unnecessary surgery.362 3. The Implementation of Efficiency Criteria Those hospitals with the courage to pioneer the use of medical staff efficiency screens, despite their uncertain validity, must ultimately consider how to implement the screening process. Hospitals may not rely on an internal common law of membership qualification. When Courts have also found that privilege denials may be justified when they are based upon hospital "overutilization" concerns when departments or hospitals close because of overcrowding. See Berman v. Valley Hosp., 103 N.J. 100, 114, 510 A.2d 673, 680 (1986) (hospital could deny privilege but specific program was arbitrary and unen- forceable); Desai v.

Super. 33, 53-54, 254 A.2d 125, 137 (Ch. 1969) (upholding hospital's policy of no staff admissions for obstetricians and gynecologists). These decisions are not directly applica- ble, however, because they deal with hospital rather than physician overutilization. 349 For instance, although malpractice insurance requirements are partly justified by the hospital's economic interest, they are also supported by reasoning that ultimately reflects patient welfare. "'[N]ot carrying malpractice insurance might adversely affect patient care in the hospital in that uninsured physicians might avoid participating in the care of hospital patients with serious medical or surgical problems ....' " Holmes v. Hoemako Hosp., 117 Ariz. 403, 404, 573 P.2d 477, 478 (1977) (quoting affidavit of Hoemako Hospital Administrator). 360 See Dattilo, 23 Ariz. App. at 396, 533 P.2d at 704 ("[B]etter patient care [under exclusive contracts] is achieved because of better scheduling and higher quality of results .... ."); cf Jefferson Parish Hosp. v.

One author suggests language that grants privileges to "physicians . . . who . . . demonstrate to the staff and the board that they will provide care to patients at the generally recognized professional level of quality, in an economically efficient manner, taking into account patients' needs, the available hospital facilities and resources, and utilization standards in effect at the hospital."

After overcoming the uncertainties of substan- tive validity, medical institutions must still face the daunting task of implementation. Doctors can block implementation or thwart vigorous enforcement because they firmly control the hospital credentialing pro- cess. Ultimately, then, it is the structural allocation of authority within the hospital that most frustrates institutional cost containment.

J. MED. 264, 264-65 (1977). One hospital attempted to evade this barrier by implementing efficiency criteria in the hospital's bylaws as a supplement to the medical staff bylaws. See Cantrell &amp; Flick, supra note 316, at 45. Even if this tactic were legally permissible, it would run afoul of the powerfully influential JCAH accreditation standards, which require that creden- tialing criteria be contained in the medical staff bylaws. See JCAH ACCREDITATION MANUAL, supra note 326, at 102, 108-09. Another suggested technique, which has greater merit, is for the hospital to pro- vide the medical staff with notice and an opportunity to comment on proposed hospital changes to the medical staff bylaws. According to one commentator, this technique may be sufficient to meet the JCAH nonunilateral requirement. Hershey, supra note 354, at 142.

Hospital Reorganization and the Autonomous Medical Staff 1. Demise of the Traditional Medical Staff Many management techniques envision nontraditional medical staff structures as alternatives to the independent, open, self-governing model that currently prevails. For instance, hospital management may have to assume control of the credentialing process in order to imple- ment efficiency screening. Separating the medical staff into an indepen- dent entity that forms a joint venture with the hospital in order to cre- ate financial incentives for more economical care also entails a departure from the traditional model. Finally, to give hospitals greater control over the details of practice, many commentators envision hospi- tals that will no longer consist of two separate lines of authority-one with control over financial matters and one with control over clinical matters. The two would be merged into a single, hierarchical bureau- cracy, similar to European hospitals.359 In short, this radical proposal calls for the outright demise of the self-governing medical staff.360 2. Institutionalization of the Medical Staff Physicians can be expected to show intense opposition to full-scale bureaucratization of the hospital. "The hierarchical authority structure characteristic of bureaucratic organization as delineated by Weber clearly conflicts with the physician's role expectations ... ."361 "By definition, professionals and bureaucracies are incompatible in princi- ple. . . . Essentially, science needs autonomy, whereas organizations need integration."362 Nevertheless, if medical staff independence were simply a matter of private industry custom, organizational change might be attainable. To the contrary, though, the two lines of authority that so frustrate hospital administrators and students of organization theory363 are en- trenched in the law.

FREIDSON, supra note 55, at 159 ("[T]here is an intrinsic conflict between Weber's concept of rational-legal bureau- cracy and the Anglo-American concept of professionalism."); W. KORNHAUSER, supra note 110, at 13 ("The determination of how professional work shall be conducted . . . entails a conflict between the hegemony of the organization and the autonomy of the profession."). 363 See supra notes 276-82 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="99">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 529 mal bylaws separate from the hospital's bylaws.364 Thus, the law perpetuates the anomalous institutional structure of a firm within a firm. A hospital could still theoretically exercise control over a sepa- rately organized medical staff. Large corporations, for example, are structured as classic hierarchies despite formal internal divisions. Hos- pitals, however, are unique because state licensure statutes impose the additional element of self-governance. Those statutes preserve medical staff autonomy completely by ensuring that the staff has exclusive or substantial control over vital aspects of hospital operations. Critically, the medical staff has the self-perpetuating power to determine its own membership.365 This legislated power over its own destiny gives the medical staff effective veto power over attempts to reformulate hospital structure. Physicians can frustrate the hospitals' unilateral attempts to choose medical staff members contrary to physician desires, and they can prevent hospitals from independently changing their staff from an open to a closed model, or from independent practitioners to employees. To the extent that state laws do not explicitly promote medical staff self-governance, the same effect is accomplished through the JCAH accreditation standards, which are thoroughly enmeshed in the public regulatory process.366 JCAH standards decree an organized 364 See generally AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, supra note 10 (fifty-state compendium of statutes and regulations controlling organized medical staff). 366 See, e.g., CAL. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE ? 32128 (West Supp. 1988) (stating that the medical staff "shall be self-governing with respect to the professional work performed in the hospital"); FLA. ADMIN. CODE ANN. r. 10D-28.156(4) (1986) ("No action on appointment . . . or dismissal shall be taken without prior referral to the organized medical staff for their recommendation ... ."). 366 Several states mandate JCAH accreditation; many others allow the private ac- creditation process to serve in lieu of state licensure. See Roberts, Coale &amp; Redman, A History of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, 258 J. A.M.A. 936, 939 (1987) (noting that 39 states and the District of Columbia have incorporated in varying degrees the JCAH standards into their hospital licensure statutes); see also M. MACDONALD, K. MEYER &amp; B. ESSIG, HEALTH CARE LAW: A PRACTICAL GUIDE ? 5.03[2] (1988) (stating that several additional states are considering incorporation of JCAH standards into their licensure statutes). Moreover, the Medicare program deems JCAH-approved hospitals qualified to participate without further inspection. See 42 U.S.C. ? 1395bb (1982 &amp; Supp. IV 1986); see also Jost, The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals: Private Regulation of Health Care and the Public Inter- est, 24 B.C.L. REV. 835, 845 &amp; nn. 70, 71, 74 (1983) (JCAH accreditation required for insurance coverage of certain forms of treatment in Ohio and Oregon, for state mental hospitals and university hospitals in Ohio, and for approval of residency pro- grams throughout the nation). Even without this statutory imprimatur, the JCAH, as the sole hospital accredit- ing organization, effectively has plenary authority over the structure of American hospi- tals. See Havighurst &amp; King, supra note 342, at 323. Almost no hospital of significant size will risk the business consequences of operating without its seal of approval. See Jost, supra, at 845 ("Virtually all hospitals with more than twenty-five beds" are</page><page sequence="100">530 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 medical staff whose bylaws "establish a framework for self-govern- ance."367 Notably the medical staff must have substantial authority over membership selection: it alone conducts the credentialing process that is the basis for determining admitting and treating privileges.368 3. Blocked Institutional Development Because the JCAH model of the open, self-governing medical staff is so entrenched in American hospitals, some tend to view it as inevita- ble, or at least superior to the alternatives.369 Others take a different view, maintaining it is the root of inefficiency in American medicine.370 Undoubtedly, both accounts contain some truth. After all, the American medical system is the world's most highly developed, but also the world's most expensive. In either event, the American model, dupli- cated only in Canada,37 tells us at least that other models are feasible. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the values served by the JCAH model requires an understanding of the origins of the hospital and the hospital accreditation movement. In 1919, the recently formed American College of Surgeons, seeing the need for standardization of surgical practices and credentials, im- plemented what was to grow quickly into a full-blown hospital accredi- tation movement.372 It established a set of hospital standards governing the requirements for an approved surgical practice. In setting these standards, it essentially shaped the hospital/physician structure that ex- isted at the time373 to meet its own ends: the open hospital medical staff JCAH accredited.). 367 JCAH ACCREDITATION MANUAL, supra note 326, at 114. 368 See id. at 112, 119. The AMA is lobbying to expand JCAH medical staff protections even further by removing hospital control over the selection of medical di- rectors and department chairmen and requiring medical staff approval for changes in even the hospital's bylaws. See Chapman-Cliburn, AMA Addresses Medical Staff Self- Governance, HOSPITALS, Jan. 20, 1988, at 54, 54. 369 See AMA/AHA JOINT TASK FORCE, supra note 102, at 11 (The self-gov- erning medical staff "is an essential strength in the American health care system that should not be lost or sacrificed to outside pressures."). 370 See Havighurst, supra note 93, at 1087; Havighurst &amp; King, supra note 342, at 324 n.173. 371 See AMA/AHA JOINT TASK FORCE, supra note 102, at 10-11. 372 See Jost, supra note 366, at 845-49 (describing the development of the Ameri- can College of Surgeons' Hospital Standardization Program). 373 The following synopsis of the origin is extrapolated primarily from two rela- tively brief and somewhat conflicting sketches: M. ROEMER &amp; J. FRIEDMAN, supra note 30, at 33-43; P. STARR, supra note 30, at 162-69; see also C. ROSENBERG, THE CARE OF STRANGERS (1987) (history of American hospitals); D. ROSNER, A ONCE CHARITABLE ENTERPRISE (1982) (studying the institutional changes in New York City hospitals between 1885-1915). In the American colonies, hospitals began as almshouses for the poor, typically</page><page sequence="101">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 531 was preserved, but with the requirement that the staff be separately organized. These essential elements have been perpetuated to the pre- sent day by the JCAH (formed in 1952 by the American College of Surgeons in conjunction with the AMA, the AHA, and the American College of Physicians), which has assumed the hospital accreditation function.374 This history's primary lesson is that the medical profession has determined not only the terms of its interaction with hospitals but also the very structure of the hospital itself. This control was accomplished through the JCAH, three of whose four founding groups are physician associations. The hospital industry still does not have a controlling voice in the organization that sets its accreditation requirements.375 Not surprisingly, then, these "organizational arrangements . . . were in large part designed and forced upon the system by organized medicine" to serve the interests of physicians.376 operated by the government and employing a small staff of full-time doctors. People who could afford a private physician at home stayed clear of hospitals (or "asylums" as they were often called). With the advancement in surgical techniques, the development of anesthesia, and the implementation of aseptic and antiseptic procedures during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, however, hospitals quickly became indis- pensable adjuncts to surgery. Hospitals began allowing "visiting physicians" to use the hospital facility to treat their own private, paying patients in exchange for donation of the doctors' time to treat the institution's charitable beneficiaries. As greater demands were placed on the few existing pay beds, a new form of hospital emerged that catered predominantly to middle and upper class patients. Many of these private hospitals re- tained their charitable affiliation, but many were organized and owned by doctors. The original almshouses, facing a loss of their supportive paying patients, responded by opening their staffs to all qualified physicians. This rapid developmental period from 1900 to 1920 was spurred by the sharp expansion of population and territorial settle- ment in the United States. Influenced by the American laissez-faire ethic, hospitals grew in an unstructured, open fashion, in sharp contrast to European hospitals, which continued under the employment model. The open staff model was more compatible with nineteenth century American economic conditions. The United States was demo- graphically unable to support the European model of a profession that strictly divided roles between office-based generalists and hospital-based specialists. See Mechanic, The Changing Structure of Medical Practice, 32 LAW &amp; CONTEMP. PROBS. 707, 708 (1967). 374 At about the same time, many of the hospital accreditation standards were codified in state licensure statutes based on a model act heavily influenced by these organizations. M. ROEMER &amp; J. FRIEDMAN, supra note 30, at 40. 375 See In re American Medical Ass'n, 94 F.T.C. 701, 756 (1979) (listing numer- ous ways in which "JCAH accreditation standards follow AMA policy"); Roberts, Coale &amp; Redman, supra note 366, at 938 (the AHA only appoints seven of 22 JCAH commissioners). 376 Havighurst, supra note 93, at 1086. The current structure serves physicians' interests in a number of ways. Doctors have avoided the power and influence that large, financially strong institutions usually exert by ensuring delegation to themselves of control over substantial segments of hospital operations. By carving out a guarantee of open access coupled with independence, physicians have secured for themselves a cost-free workplace of extraordinary technological sophistication. Neither the master</page><page sequence="102">532 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 To preserve their privileged position in hospitals, physicians have created a phenomenon medical sociologist Paul Starr describes as "blocked institutional development," rendering the hospital "a pre- capitalist institution radically changed in its function and moral identity but only partially transformed in its organizational structure."377 In other words, the development of the independent medical staff is best described as the non-happening of an event. Doctors continue to relate to hospitals in essentially the same way they did when hospitals first became desirable places to seek medical treatment. The medical profes- sion simply extended to the twentieth century the predominant nine- teenth century format of independent, entrepreneurial practice that arose during medicine's developmental era.378 Cementing the JCAH medical staff model into the law is poor public policy. Mandating a single institutional structure blocks organi- zational innovation in response to new environmental forces. As Clark Havighurst has convincingly argued, "how a hospital is internally or- ganized and run should be a managerial issue, not a legal one."379 What the optimal hospital structure is and how the institution will be transformed if public and private barriers are removed should be left to the future.380 If the forces of this new era are applied to an unbending structure, they will either be deflected or the structure will shatter. V. CONCLUSION "A strong consensus has emerged among health economists over the past couple of years that the cost-containment effort is in general a failure. Not one of the major cost-containment initiatives has yet suc- ceeded-or shows any serious promise that it will eventually succeed. Not even the slightest downward dip of any significance has appeared on those economic charts that measure the ever-rising cost of health nor the servant of the household, they enjoy the privileged status in the hospital of an honored guest. 877 P. STARR, supra note 30, at 179. 378 See Scott, supra note 72, at 217. 379 Havighurst, supra note 93, at 1082. 380 Physicians are not unduly threatened by this uncertainty because, however transformed, [h]ospitals will always need physicians.. . As a result, they will strive to create conditions that . . will accommodate [physicians'] interests wher- ever possible ... [Therefore,] the intra-institutional power shifts that are occurring are simply correcting existing imbalances and will stop well short of forcing physicians into positions inconsistent with their profes- sional and independent status.

Contemporary reimbursement policy assigns to institutions the broad new responsibility of leading the revolution in health care cost containment. For reimbursement reform to work, hospitals, HMOs, and other health care institutions must aggressively adopt management techniques that disseminate to physicians the same efficiency incentives that prospective payment places on them. The law, however, frustrates institutional control at every turn. Lay administrators and even physi- cian supervisors may not direct the course of treatment. The law for- bids hospitals from passing their financial incentives on to physicians, and Congress is giving serious consideration to extending this ban to HMOs. The corporate practice doctrine prohibiting employment deters hospitals from employing physicians. Restricting access to medical insti- tutions on efficiency grounds is legally uncertain and laden with dis- couraging legislation. General structural reform is hampered by laws that institutionalize status quo patterns. It is troubling but not surprising to find that a revolutionary change in health care policy does not fit well with the pre-existing legal structure. It is more important to explore whether the extent to which the law protects physician independence is justified and whether the legal structure is capable through evolutionary change of absorbing the new public policy. To answer these inquiries, we have engaged in a deeper socio-political analysis of the origins of the law's current orien- tation. This analysis has revealed the remarkable extent to which the law reinforces the medical profession's interests, power, and autonomy. A. Physician Dominance Through the Law The thorough grounding of the law in the values and relationships of traditional medicine has essentially codified the ethic of professional 381 Callahan, Allocating Health Resources, HASTINGS CENTER REP., Apr.-May 1988, at 14, 14. 382 For instance, a recent ProPac report to Congress, see Medicare Prospective Payment and the American Health Care System, [June 1988] Medicare &amp; Medicaid Guide (CCH) No. 560 (extra ed. July 26, 1988), explained that the Medicare cost per case "initially declined below inflation in the first year of PPS," but "subsequently rose to about 10 per cent per year-6 percentage points above inflation." The reporting committee acknowledged that it "does not completely understand why [these cost in- creases] have occurred." Id. at 5.</page><page sequence="104">534 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 sovereignty. Throughout, the law embodies the professional ideal of in- dependent practice facilitated but unconstrained by institutional capital. The unlicensed and corporate practice prohibitions are consciously designed to prevent lay institutional interference with physician auton- omy. The law goes further and protects physicians from even peer scru- tiny through the tortious interference concept. Fee splitting prohibitions implicitly promote an ethic of solo, fee-for-service practice unfettered by external financial influence by inhibiting the formation of group prac- tices, branding as unethical any financial inducement to send patients elsewhere for treatment, and directly prohibiting the use of financial incentives to influence physician practice patterns. The law relating to medical staff privileges may be more respon- sive to change despite its focus on the dominating industrial and profes- sional imperative of quality, but it still generously protects professional interests against institutional infringement with its careful scrutiny of private association membership decisions. The self-governing nature of the medical staff and its explicit control over its own destiny prevents any unilateral action by the hospital from changing the process by which staff members are selected. Both this process and the structure of the staff as a whole are fashioned to reinforce the independence of the medical staff as a separate line of authority within the hospital, to the exclusion of alternative organizational structures. Perhaps the strongest motif that emerges from this exposition is the distinction between individual and group autonomy. "Professional autonomy is based on the belief that qualified practitioners are best able to determine how the function ought to be performed, and that each practitioner must be free to exercise his own judgment in the spe- cific case."383 This dichotomy serves as a powerful organizing principle for understanding the way in which professional independence has in- filtrated legal principles and medical institutions. Each of the branches of law implicated by the three classes of control techniques-directives, incentives, and reorganization-reflects careful preservation of physi- cian autonomy in both dimensions.384 s38 W. KORNHAUSER, supra note 110, at 1 (emphasis altered). 384 Group autonomy is protected from lay administrative rules by unlicensed and corporate practice prohibitions. Supervision from within the collegium, which is not threatening to group professional autonomy, is nevertheless constrained by tortious in- terference principles because it invades individual clinical discretion. Fee splitting laws have also been applied to both individual and, to a lesser extent, to group incentives. When the institution turns to organizational structure, it continues to face the same two lines of defense. The law gives detailed scrutiny to the grounds for individual medical staff discipline administered by fellow physicians, and it insulates this process from hospital overhaul by mandating medical staff independence and self-governance.</page><page sequence="105">1988] HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT 535 B. Critique of Physician Autonomy To a large extent, this preservation of professional autonomy is unjustified. Unquestionably, sound medical practice requires a degree of restriction on interference with the details of medical treatment, whether from a lay or professional source. The scientific foundations of medicine justify some group autonomy and its judgmental nature justi- fies some individual autonomy. It is wrong, however, to insist on abso- lute freedom from control. When the unknown value of medical proce- dures leaves a broad range of acceptable methods of patient management and medical practice-the current situation with the great bulk of medicine-it is difficult to maintain that influencing physicians to exercise their judgment conservatively is inappropriate.385 To the ex- tent that restrictions on institutional influence lack a strong quality-of- care justification, they serve primarily to protect the vested interests of physicians. Astonishingly, physicians have demonstrated continuing success in convincing legislatures to extend further these protections despite a fun- damental reorientation in health care policy. The federal government has equivocated on institutional control by banning hospital attempts to pass prospective payment incentives on to physicians and by excluding efficiency considerations from its protection of peer review. Congress' 386 See E. FREIDSON, supra note 48, at 182-83. Much of what is called patient management . is not sustained or chosen by any systematic scientific knowledge, but rather by personal preference and experience and by occupational custom and folklore. As management, hospital administration should be prepared to take issue with medical dominance over that portion of medical work that influences the well-be- ing and satisfaction of patients without at the same time having a technical or scientific rationale. Id.; see also P. STARR, supra note 30, at 5 (distinguishing between the technical as- pects of medical practice and its socio-economic effects). As further justification for restricting professional dominance of medical practice, Freidson argues: But even if there were a science of administration or teaching, or consulting, or whatever is involved in applying knowledge, the autonomy of practice would still not be justified owing to the fact that, apart from what is purely technical and instrumental about practice, there is embod- ied in it an ineradicable moral element. ... These considerations of the moral consequences of the social choices which are inherent in the process of applying knowledge are not merely technical and cannot justifiably be determined by experts alone. Thus, I argue, professional autonomy in de- termining the content of all of its work is not justified: autonomy in devel- oping the knowledge embodied in the content of work may be appropriate, but autonomy in determining the practical modes of applying that knowl- edge is not. E. FREIDSON, supra note 30, at 357-58.</page><page sequence="106">536 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 137:431 deep seated ambivalence about the need to restrict services has helped to undermine current cost containment policy. By this critique, I do not mean to accuse physicians or lawmakers of calculated manipulation of the law to pursue evil ends. I mean only to register the undeniable fact that the law acts as a force against re- form because it is naturally contoured to fit the shape of traditional medical relationships. The connection between the law and physicians' interests is an organic one, not a conspiratorial one.386 Nevertheless, the blunt fact remains that our health care cost con- tainment policy is doomed to failure, or at least to mediocrity, in the current legal environment. Physicians, who have shown extraordinary resistance to change in the past,387 will use every weapon in their con- siderable arsenal to defend against the onslaught of new economic and social forces. Already, leaders in the profession are sounding the alarm that "physicians must either gain control ... or work for those who do control . . ."388 Although physicians are now prohibited from using their code of ethics to block economic reform, the prognosis for cost containment remains poor in view of the broad range of legal doctrines that provide physicians with ample protection from institutional influ- ence. In short, the new reimbursement policy cannot survive in a legal climate so fundamentally infused with a professional libertarian credo. 386 In the words of Eliot Freidson: Both professional and bureaucrat have, by and large, the best of inten- tions. Both, like everyone else, are creatures of their perspectives, and those perspectives are limited by training, by commitment, and by per- sonal work experience that comes to be regarded as wisdom. E.
