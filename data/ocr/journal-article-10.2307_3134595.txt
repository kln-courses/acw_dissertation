<plain_text><page sequence="1">EQUIVALENCE, PERSONHOOD AND RELATIONALITY: PROCESSES OF RELATEDNESS AMONG THE HOTI OF VENEZUELAN GUIANA ROBERT STORRIE The British Museum The Hoti are a small group of isolated Amerindian hunter-horticulturalists living in central Venezuelan Guiana. They are arguably amongst the most egalitarian people described in Amazonian ethnography. Hoti place great emphasis on settlement endogamy, and the imperative to marry 'people of the same kind' (rather than strangers), coupled with the small size of settlements and the absence of any notion of genealogical related- ness between persons, means that marriages often take place within close genealogical range and in many cases even between siblings. For Hoti neither the notion of'incest' nor its 'prohibition' is meaningful, for without genealogy how can there be incest? Rather than focus on the lack of an 'incest prohibition', I explore Hoti ways of relating, which are revealed by this intriguing 'absence'. Hoti relationality is experiential and not genealogical, and rests upon cosmological knowledges that appear to underlie the Hoti's distinctively egalitarian sociality. The Hotil are a group of about seven hundred semi-nomadic Amerindian people living by hunting, gathering, and slash-and-burn farming in the moun- tainous tropical forest of the Serrania de Maigualida in central Venezuelan Guiana, building their houses and cutting their gardens at altitudes of between 150 and 1,000 m, with most people living between 300 and 600 m. This is a country of dense forests, streams, and fast-flowing small rivers, none of which are navigable. The core of the territory, which is exclusively occupied by the Hoti, is an area of approximately 10,000 km2. This is surrounded by a wider zone of about 20,000 km2 which is well known to the Hoti as a hunting- ground, though it is not generally settled or gardened by them. For the neigh- bours of the Hoti, that is, the more-or-less sedentary Amerindian peoples who inhabit the surrounding lowland areas, the whole vast mountainous region where Hoti live, garden, and hunt is thought of as inhospitable and unsuit- able for gardens. More than half of the Hoti population live in two mission villages: Kayama in the north, which was founded in 1982 by Roman Catholic nuns from Colombia, and Cafno Iguana in the south, which was established in the early 1970s by the North American New Tribes Mission. Despite this proximity to the missions, almost all the Hoti are monolingual in their own ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2003. J. Roy. anthrop. Inst.

The Hoti's neighbours to the west are the Piaroa, Yabarana, and Hiwi; to the south and east, the Ye'kuana and Sanema; and to the north, the Panare. (See Map.) Hoti sociality does not recognize any idea of genealogical connection between persons. Perhaps the most striking consequence for anthropological understandings of relatedness is that, for the Hoti, neither the notion of'incest' nor its 'prohibition' are meaningful. What I discovered over the course of my MAP. The location of the Hoti and neighbouring groups. 408</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT STORRIE fieldwork is that most groups among the Hoti place an emphasis (amounting almost to an imperative) on settlement endogamy, a preference which is found throughout the Guiana region.2 However, unlike other Guianese societies, the Hoti have no expressed incest prohibition. Indeed, sibling marriage is a preferred option in some groups, accounting for 18 per cent of all marriages in the population living in the northern half of Hoti territory. I found one example of father-daughter marriage that had produced children, but no existing mother-son marriages. In this article I will examine how the Hoti establish processes of personal relatedness in the absence of genealogical classification. 'Incest' has, in the past, exercised a particular fascination for anthropologists but its absence in this case, as either a concept or a prohibition, should not be viewed as an exotic anomaly. My examination of Hoti relatedness is intended to illuminate Hoti cosmological thought more generally, in which context this supposed lack reveals an epistemology that is based upon neither genealogical ways of thought nor classificatory logic. The ethnography pre- sented in this article contributes to current debates on the fluidity of ways of relating. Gow (1991) and Carsten (2000), for example, examine notions of relatedness as a process, rather than as a given system of classification. Of par- ticular interest to this work are the writings of Overing (1999) and Overing and Passes (2000), who highlight the importance of everyday lived experience and conviviality in establishing sociality within the Amazonian context. Such an approach is particularly relevant for understanding Hoti ways of being because everyday lived moralities are inseparable from cosmological knowl- edge. The Hoti ethnography presented here reveals not only the necessity for acknowledging the processes involved in experiential relatedness but also explores the inadequacy of rigid systems of genealogical classification which have underpinned much kinship theory.3 My Hoti teachers showed me, in many different contexts, that the models I sought to apply did not appear meaningful for them, and that anthropologi- cal categories such as 'kinship' do not usefully represent Hoti conceptions. Nevertheless, it was through thinking about how and why these models did not work that I was able to explore Hoti expressions of intersubjective rela- tionships, relatedness, sentiment, emotion, rights and duties, and environmen- tal perception, and for this reason the models remain important. The lessons I have learned from the Hoti provide an opportunity to re-examine theories of Guianese and Amazonian kinship, and question, certainly in this case, the notions of exchange or alliance which underpin many of these theories. The following account, from my fieldwork, describes an important moment in my increasing awareness of my own preconceptions about ways of relating. An ethnographic lesson We were seated together just inside the low doorway to the long-house. I had my back to the door, and Uliha and Wiyu were facing me, leaning against each other. They were spinning cotton together, chatting and laughing. They sat just far enough inside the house to avoid the biting insects that darted in 409</page><page sequence="4">ROBERT STORRIE and out of the doorway, probing the darkness of the house. A small cooking fire of embers glowed between three hearth stones. From time to time, one or the other would lean forward, deftly plucking at a roasting sweet potato. Further inside the house, several people lay in their hammocks, resting through the hottest part of the day. They dozed or cooked, and murmured their com- ments as they listened to my conversation with Uliha and Wiyu, occasionally raising their voices to join in or to laugh good humouredly at my foolish questions and comical pronunciation. Uliha and Wiyu have four sons between the ages of 7 and 17, all of whom still share their hearth. The couple are elders by Hoti standards: he, Uliha, is in his 50s and Wiyu is about ten years younger. That day, I was talking to them about their kin. I was particularly interested in their parents and grandparents, as I hoped to establish the genealogical links among the twenty-eight people of their long-house. Their group was the most recent to settle at the mission village of Kayama, having arrived at about the same time as I did, a year before. As with all the other people I had interviewed on the subject, Uliha and Wiyu only responded in the vaguest terms to questions about genealogical relationships between their close consanguines. I had discovered that the deno- tata for the many relationship terms commonly used by the Hoti were so broad in their application that it was unhelpful to try to translate them with English kinship terms (Storrie 1999: 69). (See Table 1.) The terms used by two people for each other will usually begin with the older person initiating the use of a term that they feel to be appropriate for the relationship between them. It is very unlikely that either person in such a situation would have further information about the actual genealogical relationship between them, even where it is in fact close, for example, a parent's sibling's child. There is no distinction between kin and affine apparent in the relationship terminol- ogy. Attempting to identify people by name was even less rewarding. Before the advent of mission names, the Hoti do not appear to have had any habit of objective naming. Names were, and often still are, personal, subjective, and changeable. The direction of our conversation was making me feel increasingly uncom- fortable. I had established that Uliha and Wiyu had been born and raised in the same house, and however I phrased my questions they repeatedly and cheerfully confirmed that they had the same mother and father. Me: What did you call the woman from whose stomach you were born/ grew/came? Wiyu: ama (mother). Me: What did you call the man from whose seed you were born/grew? Uliha: lai (father). Me: When you were young, what did the other people of your house call the man from whose seed you were born/grew? Uliha and Wiyu: Jaboha. Me (to Uliha): What was your [father] called? Uliha: Jaboha. Me (to Wiyu): And what was your [father] called? Wiyu: Jaboha. Me: The man from whose seed you [pointing to Wiyu] were born is the same man as the man from whose seed you [pointing to Uliha] were born? 410</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT STORRIE Them: a-ha (yes). Me: What did the other people of your house call the woman from whose stomach you were born/grew/came? Them: tainde (don't know). ama, u (mother). Me: The woman from whose stomach you [pointing to Wiyu] were born is the same women as the woman from whose stomach you [point- ing to Uliha] were born. Them: a-ha (yes). As this dialogue reveals, Uliha and Wiyu both unselfconsciously agreed that they were born from the same woman, for whom they had no name other than ama or u;4 it also shows that they had the same father, a man whom others in their house referred to as Jaboha. I felt inhibited about asking them directly if they were indeed brother and sister. I had a feeling that perhaps I should wait until I could speak to them in private before broaching what I thought would be a delicate subject.Yet it was clear that Uliha and Wiyu did not share my discomfort. Nor did the other occupants of the long-house, all of whom happily confirmed that they were indeed siblings. My wish to spare Uliha and Wiyu the embarrassment of publicly discussing their 'incest' clearly reveals the 'problem' of incest. Their relationship is only 'incestuous' in the context of my belief in the reality and universality of genealogical understandings of the con- nection between them, a conviction that they do not share. Perhaps the main reason why I was so resistant to what Uliha and Wiyu, amongst others, were telling me was that it so closely corresponded to the neg- ative stereotypes with which I had been confronted as I travelled through the territories of the Hoti's neighbours. When I was beginning my fieldwork, during the initial survey of the rivers that led towards the Hoti, searching for routes into their mountains, I was told stories by the surrounding down-river peoples whose riverside settlements and villages I visited. They spoke of small, pale-skinned forest-dwellers who live in the Maigualida mountains - shy prim- itives without steel tools, glimpsed only occasionally vanishing into the forest as silently as ghosts. The Piaroa andYabarana told of their hunters and miners going too far into the mountains and disappearing without trace, having fallen victim, they said, to these forest people. They seemed to be describing extreme versions of the Hoti, caricatures that emphasized and exaggerated wildness, primitiveness, and danger. The people around the small jungle town of Man- apiare, in the shadow of the Maigualida mountains, disagree about whether or not these people are the same as the Waruwaru, their name for the Hoti. Most appeared to think that they are Mountain Hoti, wild kinsfolk of the Waruwaru families whom they know through occasional trading contact. Many of the Amerindian people who told me these stories came from com- munities that had been in close contact with the Venezuelan state for up to thirty years. Most of the children and some of the adults had attended schools where they would have been exposed to images of primitive, exotic, and wild Indians through their textbooks and teachers. I do not know to what extent these ideas and images emanating from the national society have shaped the views that Piaroa, Yabarana, andYe'kuana (amongst others) have of themselves as 'Indians', and of their place and in particular how they see their own posi- tion in a notional evolutionary hierarchy of more-or-less 'civilized' peoples 411</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT STORRIE TABLE 1.

Nevertheless, among the region's lowland 'Indian' people, the Spanish words meaning'primitive', 'wild','hungry', 'fierce','poor', or'impov- erished' are used very freely to describe the unknown and distant Hoti.Those few Hoti who live closer to the navigable rivers and maintain regular contact are usually referred to in sympathetic terms. Walter Coppens described a similar situation during his visits to the Hoti in the dry seasons of 1973 and 1976. He says that the Piaroa and Yabarana groups of this area considered themselves 'civilizados' in comparison to the Hoti, whom they referred to as 'pobrecitos' (literally,'the little poor ones'), and who were, they said, in need of charity (1983: 295). In general the Hoti are viewed both warily and with a degree of pity by their neighbours. They are feared as shamans: indeed, when they speak of the Hoti, Panare and Piaroa men use the Spanish words brujo (witch) and curan- dero (healer). (Hoti, on the other hand, have no word for a person with shamanic powers: it is highly dangerous to claim such power, and they speak merely of someone who 'knows well'.) At the same time, however, other Amerindians regard the Hoti as childlike. Thus, among the Yabarana, who with the support of Survival International have launched a massive claim for lands including all Hoti territory, it is customary to describe the Hoti in Spanish as 'simple people' who 'do not understand' (politics and so on) and are como nihos ('like children'), needing the protection of more worldly-wise people like themselves. For Piaroa and Ye'kuana, the proof of this backward state is the Hoti's lack of the technology for processing bitter manioc into cassava bread and fermented drinks. For Piaroa and Ye'kuana, these are staple foods without which civilized life is impossible. On more than one occasion my Piaroa guides said that we should take bitter manioc stems with us, so that we could plant them and teach the Hoti how to grow 'proper' food. They would also tell me that the Hoti were starving up in their mountains where the soil is too poor to cultivate productive gardens, or for them to feed them- selves properly. The Panare, who have lived for several generations, at least, in close proximity to the Hoti in the area around the present mission village of Kayama, frequently display much contempt for the Hoti. I was often asked by them why I did not learn a 'proper' language (which is to say, one like Panare). For Panare also, food marks a distinction between the truly human and the somewhat less than human; they explain that the Hoti have neither salt nor the knowledge of how to obtain it, which, as it happens, is true (M.-C. Mattei, pers. comm.). The Panare point to other less-than-fully human behav- iours as evidence of Hoti inferiority: their habit of men and women laugh- ing, touching, and grooming each other in public, without shame. The Panare also say that the Hoti marry their sisters. These claims about 'incest' (from the Panare point of view) suggest a perception of the Hoti as non-social and not fully human. I soon discovered that the nuns at the Kayama mission agreed with the Panare that the Hoti, in their ignorance, did indeed marry their sisters. Given the prevailing attitudes that I encountered among down-river peoples who saw the remote, mountain-dwelling people as embodiments of wildness and difference, I was inclined to consign these accusations of nakedness, magic, and incest to the same anthropological category as 'cannibalism' and 413</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT STORRIE 'witchcraft'. However, it may appear from the dialogue between myself and the married siblings, Uliha and Wiyu, recounted above, that the Hoti are indeed incestuous. Nevertheless, my point in this article is that it is incorrect to label such relationships 'incestuous'. Hoti relationality does not recognize any idea of genealogical relatedness, and without genealogy how can there be incest? As Wagner has said, 'the notion of incest presupposes a conception of kin role' (1972: 602). For there to be incest, there must be an understanding of kinship that recognizes and specifies different categories of person. In what follows, I shall demonstrate that Hoti notions of personhood provide a lived alternative to genealogical understandings of relatedness. Personhood and equivalence Hoti are very circumspect about contact with strangers. They tend to be highly individualistic, have an egalitarian ideology, and assert the essential equivalence of all beings. All Hoti I spoke to were very reluctant, even in private, to discuss ideas of norms or social rules. I found them to be highly reluctant to make assertive statements, or to state or make explicit rules that are in any way prescriptive or that might imply the making of moralistic judgements about others. This refusal to make assertive statements extends to a recognition of the central importance of individual experience, even in accounts of well-known or shared events. There can be no orthodoxy where it is expected that there will be different points of view, all of which are held to be equally valid. Hoti ideas of the person, and of what it is to be human, are central to any attempt to understand their ways of relating. For the Hoti, the boundaries between interior and exterior, and self and other are neither sharply drawn nor immovable. The distinction between body and mind (or soul) is clearly not marked by the same ontological discontinuity that has often prevailed in Western thought. The notions of humanity which define and generate persons are inclusive of the whole environment. Thus the moral sphere includes all beings of the cosmos, so that household pets, family members, and the powerful masters of animals" all hold the same moral understandings. There are numerous examples among Amazonian peoples, including the Hoti, of the 'environment' being regarded as a personified subject rather than an object. All the elements of the environment are not merely alive, but are alive in the same way, that is to say, animated by and sharing the same life- giving substance (e.g. Townsley 1988: 120). Those aspects of beings that are manifest in the shamanic environment are identical in appearance; they are the animating principles, the hodi' (singular, ho). When one sleeps, the ho leaves the body and can travel freely, visiting the houses of the Masters, or the Dead. It is only when asleep, when the ho is free, that the living can ordinarily see and visit, and be visited by, the dead and the other ro ma hladi' (the Outside or Supernatural Beings). Likewise, when one is awake it is the ho that sees, but it is confined in time and space to its body and the waking world. Persons, and beings, can also affect, influence, change, and transform each other to varying degrees - principally through ingestion and consumption, 414</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT STORRIE but also through dreams and direct confrontation. Through sharing and com- mensality, persons can grow to share substance; the important notions of 'substance', transformation, and power are examined in detail below. It is the similarity and exchangeability of'substance' and above all the equiv- alence of all living beings which places them within the same moral envi- ronment and excludes the construction of separate social and natural domains. Persons, for the Hoti, are potentially inter-permeable in both their corporeal and incorporeal aspects, changing and shifting through their interactions and lived experience. The Hoti challenge our assumptions about the limits and boundaries of persons. Waking memories, reflections, and dreams can all be external to the person - they can be described by Hoti as encounters with other persons. For example, thoughts of a deceased relative need not be memories, but can, depending upon the emotional experience, be an actual encounter with the dead person.6 Hoti men and women constantly strive for equality, between the genders as in other spheres, and they are arguably amongst the most actively egalitar- ian people described in Amazonian ethnography (Storrie 1999). I believe that this emphasis upon equality, and upon the moral paradigm that drives it, is founded upon the cosmological equivalence of all beings. This equivalence springs from the nature of the ho. The hodi of all sentient beings, indeed poten- tially all objects,7 have the same origin, all are coeval and equivalent in capac- ity and power. They all come from the same source before life, and return to it after death. Death is a timeless, placeless place, accessible to everyone through dreams, and to shamans whose sensibilities are such that they do not need to sleep to see the dreamed world. I felt that the Hoti sought to minimize, even to deny difference. One could perhaps say that they assert difference to be an illusion of the waking world. Notions of alterity In keeping with their emphasis on egalitarianism, the Hoti expect individual people to hold different points of view and accept all such views as poten- tially valid and legitimate. In everyday lived experience, this means that the moral sphere of equivalence can change so that beings can move in and out of it, thus becoming 'others'. Furthermore, even those beings acknowledged to be equivalent can still be dangerous or immoral and, as such, need to be excluded from the domain of humanity. For example, all the Hoti I asked agreed that it is inconceivable for one human being to kill another. However, the killing of other people does occur, and on those very rare occasions when it happens it is justified by the explanation that the dead person was not human. Thus the killer can justify their action by claiming that their victim, despite having an equivalent ho, falls into the realm of the Other. In the section that follows, I explore the processes by which these understandings of alter- ity come into being. I never heard anyone among the Hoti explain their relations to each other, or with others, in terms of rules or kinship systems. For them, the world is divided into 'people like us' (hye hodi', 'my people') and 'people not like us' (abaladi' hodi, 'other people', or toto hodi, 'distant, faraway people'). The 415</page><page sequence="10">ROBERT STORRIE implication of this is that there can be no fixed or distinct classes of Hoti people, that is to say, no static groups of people whom one might know as affines and consanguines. The existential framework and sense of well-being that Hoti derive from everyday relationships stand in place of what we call 'kinship', and this is a matter of the interaction of distance and sentiment. In Amazonia generally, there is an emphasis upon achieving 'emotional comfort in daily life' (Overing &amp; Passes 2000: 1). The elimination of anger from the social space and the achievement of tranquility and conviviality indicate a successful, moral community of similars. Where anger or discord is present, this suggests a moral failure of sociality, generosity, and community.8 As I have already indicated, there is no interest or concern among the Hoti about any possible genealogical basis for their relationship terminology. The important thing is whom one lives with. How one came to live with these people is largely unimportant. We make the assumption that people are bound together specifically because they belong to the same family, but the accident of belonging to a family is what gives the members of a house or commu- nity the opportunity to develop trust and become bound together. Although I found that the category of 'my people' was often synonymous with co- residence, I also discovered that the degree of relatedness of any two individ- uals can be highly ambiguous. For example, I interviewed all of the twenty- four adults in Cano Iguana who had one or more co-resident siblings, focusing on what they perceived to be their relationships with the other ninety adults in the village. When our discussions focussed only on whether some other resident in Cafio Iguana was or was not felt to be a member of hyedi' Iodi' ('our people'), none of the interviewees agreed with their siblings on every- one who should be included in this kindred group. Yet when the context of our conversation included visitors from other, more distant settlements, all of those interviewed increased the scope of their hyedi hlodi' group to include almost all co-residents. It is the context that determines relatedness. The divisions that an individual makes between 'us' and 'not us' are not absolute, and movement can occur between and within the categories. Strangers include everyone never seen or met, as well as people who live in distant territories who are seen only occasionally. Strangers can also be people whom one sees regularly and with whom one maintains regular social rela- tions, but who nevertheless entered the life-world at a known, historical time, and were not in it from the beginning. The world of kin (which the Hoti call hyedi' lodi) is composed of all non-strangers, in other words anyone who has always been part of one's life-world is a relative. This can be extended in many cases because someone whom one does not know but who is the kin of one's kin may easily enter the category of'my people', though this is not necessarily the case. One defining characteristic of kin is the general acceptance of their rights to residence within a particular territory, and this can be traced to the notion of a shared relationship with the same group of geographically specific 'other-than-human' forest Elders or Masters. The members of a Hoti community feel themselves to share a relationship with the positive spirits or shamanic beings with whom they also share a territory. This common bond with supernatural co-residents is another way in which the sense of belonging to the group is expressed. It is also a mechanism for defining a sense of rights of residence within, and use of, a territory. These 416</page><page sequence="11">ROBERT STORRIE supernatural kinsmen, the coaimo 'Elders (Masters) of the Outside, or Forest' are the defenders of the territory they share with the Hoti. They are detected in the waking world in thunder and lightning, which are their shouts and the flashes of their lance-points, or sometimes they are seen, or heard, as jaguars. They are perceived in dreams as shining anthropomorphic beings, painted with bright red onoto dye. Trust and sentiment For Hoti, one of the key characteristics of a kin relationship is trust. There need not necessarily be love or affection, or even friendship, though people for whom one feels these things are clearly kin, but trust is one of the few essential discriminators between kin and strangers. Within the notion of trust, I would include ideas of predictability, reliability, and safety. Trust between kin is not based upon 'faith'; it comes from familiarity, and from knowing the other person, which is why trust between kin comes from ex- perience and from living together. The importance of predictability lies in knowing the other person's nature, and trusting them to behave according to their nature. Ideally, people should not marry strangers, though as a result of marriage one may come to live among others who consider one, and whom one con- siders to be, 'strangers'. By conforming - being generous, sociable, co- operative, and so on - such people (in-marrying others) can establish a degree of rights of residence, independent of their spouses. Children born to a stranger within a particular settlement or group are not strangers, and with their rise to maturity they can confer entry into the group of kin for their parents. Over time, a stranger can become increasingly trusted, through be- having consistently and calmly, that is, without violence or anger. Any one instance of anger or aggression is remembered and remains forever part of that person as a possibility. It is, in a sense, never forgiven; and this might be another distinction between kin and strangers - close kin who manifest anger are forgiven, and will generally be tolerated, at least for as long as this anger is never turned towards their co-residents. As my argument rests, in part, upon the assertion that Hoti do not have an incest prohibition because they do not have a notion of incest (which in turn is a result of the fact that they do not account for the connections between kin in terms of genealogy), I think it would be useful to say something about what I mean by marriage in this case. After all, 'incest prohibitions' have gen- erally been taken to relate to marriage rules that sanction or prohibit partic- ular relationships, as much as to sexual relations between close consanguines.9 There is no single word that corresponds to 'marriage' in Hoti. One can say hye mali ('my man') or hye au ('my woman'), or speak of hye ka ma mali/hau 'my "with-me" man/woman', and this refers to one's partner in a publicly recognized economic, co-resident, and usually (though not invariably) sexual relationship between a man and a woman who are expected (usually) to produce and raise children together. I think this broadly corresponds to our notion of marriage, and I am confident about using the word as a gloss for this relationship. 417</page><page sequence="12">ROBERT STORRIE Marriage itself is unmarked by any ceremony beyond the moving of a hammock and personal possessions by the in-marrying spouse. If the marriage is taking place between co-residents, that is, people living in the same house or the same settlement, then the only change will be that the couple will begin to share a hearth. Most people have more than one marriage in their lifetime, and as well as their marriages they will have a number of affairs (that is, a relationship conducted while co-resident with another person). To describe these affairs as 'extramarital' would be to misunderstand the nature of marriage. The longevity of many of these relationships amounts to some- thing like a joint marriage. On average, by the time they reach their forties, most adults will have had children with three different partners. Some of these will have been 'affairs' and others will have been marriages. A couple's first marriage is not really expected to last, though it may do so, but is usually considered to be something of a trial run. The second or third union will usually last until the death of the husband or wife. In a Hoti community one never hears raised voices, or sees anger displayed, or violence or aggression. Children are never punished beyond an exasper- ated gasp, however annoying their behaviour. For Hoti, the dangers involved in displaying negative emotion are not just to do with the possible physical effects but also the perceived psychic or supernatural consequences of delib- erately or accidentally directed anger. Someone who has a capacity for anger may channel this into sorcery, albeit unconsciously, and sorcery accusations of this nature regularly occur in the mission village at Kayama where non-kin have recently settled together. A similar view of anger as destructive of social- ity has been reported for many other Amazonian groups (cf. Kidd 2000: 121; Londofio-Sulkin 2000; Overing 2000; Santos-Granero 1991: 220). Of particu- lar note here is Viveiros de Castro's account (1992: 194) of the Araweta, for whom anger is something that literally dehumanizes. In Hoti there is one word for all negative emotion, yowali, which means 'angry', 'sad', 'dangerous', 'fierce', 'violent', and so on. A fierce or dangerous animal, such as a jaguar, snake, or angry wasp, can be described as yowali. In humans, being yowali is not exclusively a characteristic of strangers, but it is the explanation most often cited for antipathy towards a particular person or group of people, and as a reason explaining why someone is not one of'my people'. All non-indigenous people and most 'Others' are described as yowali or potentially yowali, the best translation of which, in this context, would be 'angry' or 'fierce'. It suggests the possibility of violence - both physical and psychic. As well as trust and sociability, generosity is a feature of relations between kin. Generosity and yowali are linked opposites. Anyone who is not generous is liable to be suspected of harbouring other negative attributes, the lack of generosity being regarded as an outward symptom of sorcery and similar phe- nomena. A lack of generosity is also the stated cause of most disputes. The imperative towards generosity is very powerful in Hoti interpersonal relations, and it is one that appears to operate in all aspects of life. Lack of generosity is probably the worst possible trait and the most anti-social of behaviours; generosity is not merely appropriate behaviour between kin, but is also the defining moral characteristic of 'humanity' itself. Children learn from the earliest age the importance of sharing. On many occasions, I have 418</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT STORRIE walked into a house to find some small child alone, stuffing food into his or her mouth, and if there is still food in the pot then the child, however young, will run up to offer it. If the food is finished, they will spit out their last mouthful and proffer this up in their hand instead. Taxonomy and classification These notions that I present as Hoti ideas of relatedness are increasingly discussed in studies of kinship as a process of becoming related (e.g. Rapport &amp; Overing [2000]; Carsten [2000]). Likewise, relatedness, as I have used the term in reference to the Hoti, describes not merely the relationships between human beings, but in a fundamental way it provides a lens with which to examine Hoti ideas about the interrelationship of all environmental objects and persons. As Overing has said: 'For Amerindians of the Tropical Forest, the cosmological and the social form one multi-dimensional system: society as social rules - or as social structure - cannot be clearly distinguished from cosmological rules and cosmological structure' (1981: 164). To put it another way: the Hoti make no distinctions in the ways in which they talk about relations with people, animals, or personified objects in their environ- ment, and this in turn means that kinship and ecology are the same thing. For my Hoti ethnography, the key to the transition, namely from kinship as a system of classification to relatedness, or ways of relating, as an active process, lies in the restoration of the idea of 'metamorphic' or 'transformative' identity. Ingold has provided a critique of the genealogical model as the key trope in Western ideologies of knowledge and classification. He contrasts this with a relational model based upon Deleuze and Guattari's (1988) anti-genealogical 'rhizome' (Ingold 2000: 140). Ingold describes the rhizome as a relational manifold which: is to be envisaged as a dense and tangled cluster of interlaced threads or filaments, any point in which can be connected to any other ... It has the virtue of giving us a way of beginning to think about persons, relationships and land that gets away from the static, decontextualising linearity of the genealogical model, and allows us to conceive of a world in movement, wherein every part or region enfolds, in its growth, its relations with all the others (Ingold 2000: 140). I feel that this corresponds closely to the understandings of many Hoti people for whom landscape is shaped and named by the activities of all the people who have dwelt in it and by the movement of powerful beings whose marks are incised or stamped across it. According to some versions of their creation stories, the physical world was made by two brothers who used their hands to shape the rocks and mountains, which to them were as soft as clay; with cuts from a machete they formed the ravines and rivers. Strangely shaped and eroded rocks were pointed out to me as revealing the giant hand and footprints of the creators. Just as readily when travelling through the forest, people will point to the way in which the vegetation of the forest subtly changes, marking the sites of gardens or settlements abandoned generations before. As Wagner has written, 'The life of a person is the sum of his tracks, 419</page><page sequence="14">ROBERT STORRIE the total inscription of his movements, something that can be traced out along the ground' (1986: 21). Through the shamanic environment, accessible to all in their dreams, one can obtain a simultaneous overview of all of these life tracks. All of the life histories of all the beings in the world cross and interlace like the threads of the rhizome, and are all simultaneously present. Dreams are the visions or experience of the ho, the shamanic aspect of all persons, as it travels while the body sleeps. The ho, unlike the body, is not confined to the waking world, and has access to the timeless, causal, shamanic universe. Dreams provide 'eye- witness' experience of mythic events, and as such are given priority as infor- mation about the true nature of the universe. Importantly, this personal experience of the mythic inhibits the idea of conformity; indeed, it promotes continuous change and innovation. It also gives us an insight into Hoti under- standings of time. As the shamanic world constitutes an ultimate reality, in attempting to reconcile the space and time of the spirit world and of the waking world priority is given to the former. Dream time is the given; linear time is what must be explained. The created, waking world of forms, our world, is for Hoti an island both physically and temporally. It is only here that linear time operates at all. In the shamanic environment, all hodi', indeed all life, from all times in our world, are simultaneously present; all are contemporary and equivalent, and they are all coeval with each other. As Overing has explained of Amerindian views of time: In general it can be said that for Amerindians (of South America) social time is not genealogical time: time depth is a notion the Amerindians tend to avoid and even war against as a principle dangerous to their own social existence. As members of highly egal- itarian societies, it is in a similar manner that they view any power that is overtly coer- cive in expression (Overing 1981: 151). The links between anti-genealogical classification, non-linear time, and a highly egalitarian ethos are not fortuitous. While I am not in a position to suggest causal relationships, these elements clearly form part of a complex of understandings which spring from multifaceted, inclusive, and highly moral cosmological knowledges. It was my Hoti friends who, through their rejection of my expectations that I would be able to 'collect' genealogical information, brought me to the idea that dwelling together and particularly the notions of consumption and ingestion are, for them, fundamental to social identity."' Whenever I attempted to discover if there were ideas of genealogical relatedness between kin, I was told that there is nothing that links a parent to their children, or siblings to each other, apart from the bonds of affection and sentiment that they feel for each other. In other words, there is nothing more to 'relatedness' than those things that link 'all people' together. When I say 'all people' I think that, for Hoti morality, this assumes the, albeit unarticulated, notion that humanity as a moral condition is coterminous with kin. Kin are bound together by ties of shared physical and metaphysical substance, but this is not transmitted by descent. The transferable property of substance is further reflected in the morality of sharing. The most obvious thing that kin do amongst themselves 420</page><page sequence="15">ROBERT STORRIE is to share, and the most obvious thing they share is food. Sharing food, over time, transforms the unrelated into the related. This sense of shared substance is very strong among those who have been raised and nurtured together, but the transformative effect of sharing food and living together is made clear also in the case of pets, who can become kin. The idea that food, and particularly meat, is imbued with a certain agency is quite explicit for the Hoti. I was told that 'when you eat tapir meat, you become a little bit tapir'. The weakest, most vulnerable and most transformable 'eater' of meat is the unborn child. For this reason, the majority of dietary restrictions apply to pregnant women. However, restrictions also apply, to varying degrees and depending entirely upon personal sentiment, to members of the pregnant woman's kin, as all members of this group are linked together through their shared substance, and thus are capable of affecting and trans- forming each other. For the Hoti, people are grown through the participa- tion of others and the mixing of substances - not just in the womb but for all of their lives. Here, crucially, the substances that are shared and mixed by kin are not pre-specified (as they would be in a genealogical model of relat- edness) but are continually incorporated (literally embodied) through all of a child's kin. When food is offered to a guest or stranger, it is believed that the giver seeks to make the recipient like the giver. In accepting, the guest minimizes the difference between them. It is through this process that affines, and even strangers, may become kin. It is also why co-residence is so important, and why even close consanguines who are no longer co-resident are eventually forgotten, as their substance changes from shared to different. Transformational identities and cosmological equivalence The Hoti, in classifying beings and objects, are concerned both with 'what it looks like' and 'what it really is'. What it looks like appears to be rela- tively straightforward. Individuals are able to describe their experience in terms of a finely shaded descriptive vocabulary. But when one encounters another being one can seldom know for certain what it really is, at least not at the moment when one experiences it. Indeed, whether or not one has encountered a being at all might be uncertain, in the case of wind or water for example. Even grief and memories of the dead can be external and transformative agents. Black, writing about the Ojibwa, poses the question thus: What are the rules for recognizing encountered phenomena and assigning them class membership? If some ghosts have appeared in the form of birds, and some birds appear in the form of people, and some people can appear in the form of bears, and no one has really described the form of a windigo (they are most often heard or felt, not seen) - how does a man validate the essence of what he has encountered? (1977: 103). When one encounters another being the question of 'what it really is' is a question about the relative power of the encountering self and the en- countered other. 'What is power?' is as complex a question as 'What is life?' - but I believe that the most important indication of relative power lies in 421</page><page sequence="16">ROBERT STORRIE the capacity to transform. The most powerful beings are able to transform themselves freely - to shape-shift between various bodily forms. These include many of the 'other-than-human' beings: guardian spirits, forest masters, owners of animals, spirits of wind and water, some human shamans, and so on. Many of these beings also have the capacity to transform others. Thus, the 'true' identity of an encountered being can be known only by the consequences of the meeting, for example, a subsequent illness. Or it may never be known for certain. The Trio, along with many Amazonian peoples, share a similar per- spectival view. For them, according to Riviere, 'whether or not a particular creature is the actual creature they see or a spirit wearing that creature's clothes will depend upon the outcome of the encounter, unless one is a shaman and thus able to see through the disguise to the internal reality' (Riviere 1994: 257). For Hoti, the classification of living kinds is not based upon morphologi- cal characteristics, or ideas of genealogical or pre-specified relatedness, or hier- archies of species or genera. Rather, although the criteria for classification could be described as well defined, they relate to the relative power and capac- ities of the objects, beings, or persons in question, and this is always relational, since in a relational cosmology there are no persons-as-such. To be a person is always to be a person-in-relation-to. Beings and objects can be differently placed, depending upon the capacities and powers they demonstrate in dif- ferent situations. This is also highly idiosyncratic and depends upon the individual experience of the person doing the classifying. The deceptiveness of appearances, the fact that beings are known by their actions and effects, and the context-bound character of these effects, all suggest that the Hoti way of perceiving is fundamentally anti-hierarchical, anti-genealogical, and, pos- sibly (to use Black's term in reference to the Ojibwa),'anti-taxonomic' (1977: 101-4). Table 1 is based upon my discussions with many Hoti men and women about the beings that inhabit their world, and about their everyday encoun- ters with these beings in the course of their movement through the environ- ment, asleep or awake, in dreams or in the forest. This information was not collected systematically but is reordered from my fieldwork notes and interviews, and it shows the results of various individuals' speculations about 'what it could be', after a sighting or encounter with a particular being or object. Thus, for example, it can be seen (Table 2) that a jaguar encountered on a forest path might be a human shaman in the form of a jaguar, or an other-than-human person - one of the forest guardians - or it might be 'just' a jaguar. This last possibility is actually the least likely, according to the Hoti. Most importantly, in Black's analysis of the Ojibwa material, the 'essence (the only stable aspect) of the objects one is encountering at a given moment is often not expected to be known until some later moment' (1977: 103). Indeed, it may never be known, and for the Hoti, as with the Ojibwa, ambiguity is expected. This is another reason why, as I noted above, there is a recognition of the central importance of individual experience, even in accounts of well- known or shared events. Humans are relatively powerful in that they have a degree of control over their own transformation - actively participating in the wilful and mutual 422</page><page sequence="17">ROBERT STORRIE TABLE 2.

But power here is never absolute and, in transforming an animal from alive to dead and then to food, the animal exhibits its power in transforming the eater. So it is with the other-than-human-persons. Their transformational capacities (over self and other) are the cause of the most significant events in human lives. The understanding and experience of these causes comes, for humans, from the exploration of the shamanic environment. Conclusion The idea of 'incest' as an everyday occurrence within a stable, happy, and healthy population is likely to be an unsettling one, and it is important to reflect upon why both I and the Amerindian neighbours of the Hoti should have focused our attention on it.What our concept of'incest' reveals is a fun- damentally different epistemology to that described by most of the Hoti, for whom the notion does not exist. The Hoti can in no way be thought of as 423</page><page sequence="18">ROBERT STORRIE living in some sort of Rousseau-esque pre-social 'primitive promiscuity' lacking 'even' an incest taboo; rather, they live successfully and at peace in ways to which we can only aspire, with sophisticated philosophical and cos- mological understandings." I contend that Hoti sibling marriage cannot be classed as incest, because Hoti relationality does not include a recognition of genealogical links between people. The absence of a concept of incest reveals a theory of knowledge which is substantially different from those we com- monly refer to as 'Western'. What it means to be human for Hoti people is embedded in the existen- tial experience of living with others, and in the sentiments of trust, friend- ship, and affection that one feels for these others. Their broad notions of personhood and intersubjectivity, and the practical and unarticulated processes by which 'people like us' and 'people unlike us' are divided, means that 'humanity', 'animality', and 'personhood' are not obvious categories defined by physical appearance, bodies, or reference to natural kinds. Instead, Hoti start from an assumption of the essential similarity of all persons - human, animal, and spiritual - which is reflected in their highly egalitarian social organiza- tion. This equivalence of all beings does not produce sameness and unifor- mity; rather, everything and everyone is equally different. The idea of equivalence and absence of hierarchy that Hoti extend to include all beings in the world does not mean that there is any contradiction in maintaining an exclusive moral sphere of'humanity'.The essential similarity of all beings does not rule out the possibility of dangerous others. The sentiment one feels towards kin is explained in terms of a similarity of substance that comes about through living together and the physical process of sharing food. Neither the cosmos nor the social world is felt to rest upon chaos; there is order and morality, and it is through appropriate behaviour that persons recognize each other as persons. Appropriate and moral behaviour between persons of the same kind most importantly includes a complex sociality that I have glossed as 'generosity'. For Hoti there is an assumption that all beings are potentially generous and moral persons, and the giving of food and hospitality to all strangers indicates their hope that this gesture will be reciprocated. However, they do not seek to discover other moral persons, and they are prepared to encounter dangerous others. If their generosity is rebuffed or their suspicion aroused, they will readily classify the stranger as immoral, and therefore a dif- ferent kind of person, perhaps not human. It is in giving and receiving, and in sharing food and work, that people of the same kind demonstrate and nurture their shared substance. As well as generosity, appropriate behaviour between kin proscribes all negative emotion, anger, and violence. Sociality, conviviality, and morality among the Hoti are not matters of pro- scription or prescription: in their everyday personal and social lives, they demonstrate a practical knowledge of and respect for qualities of permissive- ness, non-assertiveness, generosity, and reciprocity which frame their relation- ships and set limits to their individualism. Humanity is a moral condition, not a 'natural' or a physically defined one. Where we might accept that people can behave unpredictably or immorally, this is not an option for the Hoti. Immoral beings reveal themselves through their behaviour as not human, or not fully human, or as a different kind of person. This moral condition is one to which Hoti seek to conform. The view of the self as human determines a 424</page><page sequence="19">ROBERT STORRIE particular behaviour among people: it prohibits anger and violence, and it obliges sociability, exchange, and generosity; for this reason generosity is indicative of humanity. In some contexts, many Hoti will say that everyone, all people, are the same, and they present all relations with sociable beings from kin to strangers in the moral terms of sharing, that is, in a relationship of generalized reciprocity where immediate return is not expected. But in fact the delay that is con- sidered acceptable, the elasticity of this reciprocity, is clearly different for dif- ferent kinds of people. What implicitly distinguishes 'true' humans from other kinds of people is their appropriate, sociable, generous, and moral behaviour. Kin really do share, in all sorts of everyday contexts: building houses, clear- ing gardens, hunting and fishing, sharing meat and food. It is possible that one might eventually become annoyed with a relative who always took and never gave, but any relative who behaved in this way would have to be considered either ill or mad, in which case one would have to look after them anyway. Opportunities for everyday sharing do not arise with more distant people. For them, the ideal of sharing and generalized reciprocity is necessarily com- pressed into a single exchange, and the possibilities available to a person for demonstrating their humanity through moral behaviour are reduced to being generous. The sharing and combining of substance makes it possible for a person to change their nature;'when one eats tapir meat, one becomes a little bit tapir'. Moral humans may become 'Others', and strangers can become moral humans. Among the Hoti, humanity, like their ways of relating, is not a fixed condi- tion. Persons are permeable to other persons and to powerful substances without any reference to what we might gloss as the genealogical connec- tions between them. Thus, immoral, improper, ungenerous, angry, or violent passions can affect people and make them less human. Like memories of the dead, passions can be external agents, the products of transformative substances. What I have therefore sought to show is that Hoti have their own partic- ular ways of relating which are experiential and not genealogical (Ingold 2000: 133), and which rest upon cosmological knowledges which I see as underly- ing Hoti people's distinctively Amazonian egalitarian sociality. NOTES The fieldwork for this paper was undertaken between April 1994 and February 1997, and was partly funded by a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council. The name 'Hoti' has been the most widely used designation for this group in Venezuela since the 1970s, and is derived from the word hodi' (ho + animate plural suffix, di). It is not, strictly speaking, an auto-denomination, since the word ho means 'person', or sentient being, and does not necessarily distinguish the Hoti from other humans, or humans from other persons (animals and supernatural beings). The Hoti do not have an objective name for themselves as a group, but instead refer to 'I', 'we', 'us', or 'my people'. 2Settlement endogamy is described by Riviere as 'an almost universal preference' in Guiana (1984: 40). Examples include theYe'kuana (Arvelo-Jimenez 1971), Panare (Henley 1982), Piaroa (Overing-Kaplan 1975), and Trio (Riviere 1969). 3For an examination, and critique of the 'genealogical model' in 'Western' thought, see Ingold (2000). 425</page><page sequence="20">ROBERT STORRIE 4Both ama and u can be translated as 'mother', though like most Hoti relationship terms they have a wide field of meanings. 3Every species of animal, including humans, and some plants has a ai, plural aimo (literally, Elder, Master, or Owner), an archetype or paradigm of its species, which appears in dreams or in the visions of shamans as either a shining, painted, and decorated anthropomorphic being, or in the form of his animals. These 'masters of animals', or 'spirit-owners' are widely reported among Amerindian peoples: see, for example, Arhem (1996), Descola (1992; 1996), Gow (1993: 55), Hallowell (1992), Overing (1996), Reichel-Dolmatoff (1976), andViveiros de Castro (1992), amongst others. "'See also Gow (1993: 53-4) and Townsley (1988: 107-8; 1993). 7All persons have (or are) hodi' - human, non-human, animal, some plants and, under some circumstances even meteorological forces and topographical features can also have an aspect which is hodi'. However, these 'objects' are not only material but can also include agency, power, and effect in the world, which can under some circumstances be considered sentient. For a more detailed examination of conviviality as the aim of Amazonian sociality, see, for example, Belaunde (1992), Descola (1994), Gow (1991), Londono-Sulkin (2000), and Overing (1993). 9The question of incest and its prohibition has remained central in anthropology. Its impor- tance has rested upon its supposed universality. See Leavitt (1990) for a critical review of evi- dence cited by sociobiologists. For an overview of psychological theories following Westermarck, see Sapin (1987),Wagner (2000),Westermarck (1926), and Wolf (1993). Most sig- nificant for social anthropology, however, is Levi-Strauss's account of the rule, which is for him the key to human society and culture: Levi-Strauss (1969: 24-5); cf. Arens (1986) and Wagner (1972: 605). 10For other examples of the importance of commensality among Amazonians, see also Belaunde (1992), Gow (1991; 1995), Isacsson (1993), and Overing (1989).

Equivalence, statut de la personne et ? relationnalite &gt; comme alternative a la genealogie : processus d'apparentement chez les Hotis de Guyane venezuelienne Resume Petit groupe de chasseurs-horticulteurs isoles dans le centre de la Guyane venezuelienne, les Hotis sont peut-etre l'un des peuples les plus igalitaires decrits dans l'ethnographie amazonienne. L'endogamie villageoise est un element tres important de leur societe et l'obligation d'epouser &lt;des semblables&gt;&gt; (et non des etrangers), a laquelle s'ajoutent la petite taille des villages et l'absence de toute notion de parente genealogique, aboutit frequemment a des mariages entre proches parents genealogiques, souvent entre freres et sceurs. Les notions &lt; d'inceste&gt; et de son &lt;interdit&gt; n'ont aucun sens pour les Hotis, puisqu'il ne saurait y avoir d'inceste sans genealogie. Plut6t qu'a l'absence d d'interdit de l'inceste &gt;,j'ai voulu m'interesser aux modalit&amp;s de l'apparentement chez les Hotis, revelees par cette etonnante &lt;absence&gt;. Les liens de parente entre les Hotis se fondent sur le vecu et non sur la genealogie et s'appuient sur des connaissances cosmologiques qui s'averent sous-tendre leur structure sociale excep- tionnellement egalitaire.
