<plain_text><page sequence="1">is an interpretation in which Wolfram does not just gently mock, but rather criti- cizes with extreme harshness all his major characters - the result is a view of the work in which the poet loses most of his warmth and humanity, becoming much less recognizable in the process than the poet of whom Wolfgang Mohr, with a finer sense of nuances, said: 'Ich bringe es nicht fertig, Parzival und Gawan auf verschiedene sittliche oder religi6se Prinzipien zu reduzieren'. This does not mean that this work, however mistaken in conception I take it to be, has no positive points at all. These are present both in detail (e.g. p. 58, foot- note 2: the point about an anthropomorphic view of God, or pp. 91 f.: the influence of the Apocalypse on the Kaiserchronik, v. 7938 if.) and on the larger scale. As examples of the latter I should include above all those passages where Rosskopf compares particular episodes in Parzival with corresponding passages in Hartmann's Erec, demonstrating both that Wolfram borrows from this work as much as from Iwein and also that his intentions were so different as to amount to a parody of his predecessor's chivalric idealism. If the author had remained content with this level of interpretation and had not taken his argument to the extremes we in fact encounter, his work could have been given more undiluted praise, since it is in these comparative passages that he shows both insight and an ability to pose new questions. As it is, these positive points have to be extracted from a framework argument which, in order to be at all acceptable, would have to employ a more rigorous logic than we in fact find. If this review in its turn appears to run to an extreme length in criticizing a dissertation of this nature, my plea must be that these positive points in the work deserve to be rescued and that it is even more necessary to emphasize that a fruitful theme such as Wolfram's reservations about the Arthurian ideal should not be abandoned and ignored because it has here been treated in an unsatisfactory way. CAMBRIDGE D. H. GREEN Rennewart in Wolfram's 'Willehalm': A Study of Wolfram von Eschenbach and his Sources. By CARL LOFMARK.

That Wolfram's Parzival has for too long diverted scholarly attention from the poet's other works is a fact well known and often lamented and has been recently confirmed by Professor Bumke's critical survey of Wolfram scholarship in which he finds it necessary to devote more than four times as much space to research on Parzival as to contributions on the remaining works. This regrettable onesidedness may be slowly changing, as witness Bumke's own work on Willehalm and Wap- newski's recent analysis of the lyrics, so that the two contributions under review may be welcomed as part of the overdue process of rectifying the balance. If they are largely factual, sober, and even conservative in their scholarly approach, this is not a criticism of them, but no less than what we urgently need before further work can be reliably undertaken. Professor Lofmark will have nothing to do with a self-crippling hermetic ap- proach to Willehalm, for he is laudably aware of the irreducible debt of German medieval poets to their sources (an insightwhich comes well from one who has recently written so illuminatingly in this journal on Wolfram's sources in Parzival). Accordingly, he devotes an opening chapter to the origins of the figure of Rennewart (rejecting two possible historical explanations and opting instead for fairytale Reviews 222</page><page sequence="2">origins) and a second chapter to Wolfram's treatment of his immediate source, the Bataille d'Aliscans (here he argues firmly the importance of manuscript M for Wolfram's version, a manuscript unknown to the Halle edition of the French epic used by most German scholars and therefore largely ignored by them). Having thus methodologically secured his position, Lofmark is now able to approach Wolfram's adaptation in its own right, which he does under three headings. The first is devoted to the problem of Rennewart's development (here he profitably extends to the figure of Rennewart a possibility denied in the case of Willehalm himself by Bumke, but convincingly urged by Werner Schr6der), the second to Rennewart's relationship to the Christian Empire (here again the author applies to his chosen figure a ques- tion first posed for Willehalm by Bumke) and the third to the question, raised tentatively by Schwietering but more emphatically by Mergell, whether Wolf- ram's work is a fragment or has been concluded (the author opts judiciously for the former). Even if the questions which govern the organization of this book can thus be seen to be largely derivative extensions of points already raised by others, this is no bad thing in the case of a poem where so much interpretation is still to be done, so that Professor Lofmark's consolidation achieves a number of very worthwhile gains to our understanding. He is particularly good on the question of the poet's realism (pp. I03 if.) and wish for a more rational motivation of the narrative (pp. Io6 if.) and, despite recent warnings that Parzival and Willehalm belong to different genres and are therefore to be interpreted independently, he reminds us that Wolfram himself was the first to suggest the possibility of a comparison between Parzival and Rennewart (Wh. 271, 15 ff.), which Lofmark then proceeds to execute with skill (pp. 147 if.), particularly with regard to two seemingly unimportant and isolated passages (p. 148). If the author here establishes in a passing detail the positive implications of tumpheit, this is also the case at a later stage of his argument (pp. 205 f.) where he analyses Rennewart's tumpheit as part of afelix culpa which he may be seen to share with Parzival. These points are well argued, but even more important (because more sustained and because of its wider implications) is the argument on behalf of a development-pattern in the case of Rennewart (as with Willehalm): here the author has some salutary remarks on the vexed question whether the concept 'development' is at all applicable to characterization in a medieval work of literature (pp. I43 if.) and then demonstrates his theoretical point in practice by analysing some of the symbols used by Wolfram in this connexion (Rennewart's beard, interest in horses, and his weapons), a technique which has clear parallels in Parzival. My criticisms of the work concern either minor details or no more than faults of omission. Under the first heading I include, for example, Lofmark's preference for a fairytale origin of the Rennewart figure, for this means in effect that he is explaining something unknown by something equally unknown (for little is certain about the dating and geographical spread of the fairytale analogues quoted), or, expressed in another way, that he is attempting to explain an historical problem (the genesis of the action dealing with Rennewart) by means of an essentially ahistorical class of evidence. Nor is it permissible, in a discussion of Rennewart's greater importance for Wolfram's work than Vivianz, to suggest that this was recognized by Dante on the evidence of Paradiso 18, 46 (p. 99, fn. i), unless it is maintained that Dante was acquainted with the German, rather than with French versions of the epic. Under faults of omission I shall confine myself to two points. On the question of genre Lofmark is somewhat inclined to dismiss the difference between the heroic epic and the romance too easily and to ignore the question (raised profitably, if not to our complete satisfaction, for Willehalm by Bumke) as to where Wolfram's work stands with regard to these two genres. If, as Lofmark rightly argues, Wolfram motivates Reviews 223</page><page sequence="3">his action more rationally, how far is this a feature which he has taken over from the romance (as Professor Vinaver would maintain), and how far does Willehalm show characteristics of the romance (as Bumke has also suggested)? That this kind of question can also be raised in the context of the problem of development and therefore turned against Bumke himself is an indication that, by missing this opportunity, Lofmark has unnecessarily weakened his own case. Lastly, under the heading of narrative technique (p. IO2), the author refers to 'repetitions' and 'cliches' present in Aliscans, but excised by Wolfram, without apparently recognizing that these phrases are largely the traditional formulas of the oral chanson de geste and that this should have suggested the need to discuss another question of genre, namely Wolfram's position in regard to the oral epic and the incipient written tradition of the romance. If Dr Heinzle's commentary is almost entirely linguistic and factual in scope, this is because so much elementary spadework has to be done for Titurel and because he is fully aware of the difficulties of his text (its narrow MS basis, unusual metricalform and obscure language). His method is to proceed stanza by stanza, giving the variant texts in full and commenting on points of detail, generally with a wide choice of parallels (primarily from Parzival, but also from other works) where these throw light on the present crux. The circumspection with which Heinzle discusses and adjudi- cates amongst what often amounts to a host of rival possibilities (cf. for example rat in 8, 2, uz borgen in 20, 3, the syntactical construction of 4I, 2 or the sense of 49, 2) rapidly establishes confidence in his guidance. The gains that emerge from this unexciting, but unavoidable method are its complete justification, however. From this commentary we learn, for example, not simply the textual position with regard to non-genuine stanzas and the sequence of stanzas, but also about such linguistic features as Wolfram's predilection for particular heroic terms and the novel word- formations for which he is responsible, and about literary characteristics such as his use of topoi (and in particular the way in which he will vary conventional usage) and formulaic expressions, as well as his adaptation of religious imagery to secular ends. Special mention needs to be made of the commentary on personal names (e.g. Kyot, Herzeloyde, Condwiramurs) and place names (e.g. Anschevin, Azagouc, Egremuntin), where Heinzle correlates recent contributions and at the same time shows the possible historical and literary affiliations of these names (extending to France as well as to Germany) and the possible influence of 'Etymologie als Denk- form' in at least some of these cases. As a by no means negligible side-result of this commentary we are given useful information on some of the leading concepts of Wolfram's work, such as hohe minne (3, I), kiusche (4, i), der grdl (6, i), templeisen (I I, 2). But the value of such a commentary must be judged finally by the contribu- tion it makes to our literary understanding of the poem. Dr Heinzle recognizes (p. ix) that, in the framework of his chosen method, he cannot tackle any large- scale questions of aesthetic evaluation, but it needs to be said that, whenever he attempts such assessment on the small scale dictated by a stanza-for-stanza com- mentary, he can be remarkably illuminating, as on the concept tumpheit (48, I), on the attitude of Sigune towards Anphlise (I22, 4 and 124, 2) and on Sigune's guilt (1 66, 4). That such literary interpretations do not occur more frequently is no fault of the commentator, but rather evidence of the more fundamental work which he had to do (and which still needs to be done) before a more general interpretation can be undertaken. Both the volumes reviewed here are conservative and factual in the best sense of these words, and both provide a reliable basis for further research which, it is to be hoped, will now be carried out as a token of belated justice to the poems with which they are concerned.
