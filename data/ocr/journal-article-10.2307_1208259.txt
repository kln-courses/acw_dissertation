<plain_text><page sequence="1">BAD FAITH IN THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN John V. Hagopian Probably the two leading writers to emerge in English since World War II are Vladimir Nabokov and John Fowles. Although they have entirely different backgrounds and neither is a member of any fashionable literary movement, they share some remarkable and im- portant characteristics. For one thing they are both elitists who dis- dain the political, religious, and psychological (especially Freudian) dogmas of the twentieth century. The man who wrote Bend Sinister would endorse Fowles's pronouncement: "I have . .. a violent hatred of leaders, organizers, bosses: of anyone who thinks it good to have arbitrary power over other people."' Fowles's parody of Freudian gobbledygook in The Magus is as damning as that in Lolita, and neither writer has much respect for the traditional institutions of Christianity. However, a major difference is that Fowles is explicitly doctrinaire in his commitment to existentialism and greatly admires contemporary French authors; whereas Nabokov says, "the French New Novel does not exist apart from a little heap of dust and fluff in a fouled pigeonhole."2 Fowles feels committed to "use literature as a method of propagating my view of life;"3 but Nabokov declared, "I have no social purpose, no moral message; I've no general ideas to exploit."4 Nevertheless, it can be said of Nabokov what Olshen said of Fowles, that "heterosexual love and the nature of freedom are the 'World Authors: 1950-1970, ed.

Nabokov would agree with Fowles that the novel form is "fundamentally a kind of game, an artifice that allows the writer to play hide-and-seek with the reader."6 But Nabokov, unlike Fowles, scrupulously adheres to the rules of the game ("I like composing riddles with elegant solutions"'7). Fowles cheats. For example, in the opening of The French Lieutenant's Woman, the narrator says that "the local spy . . . might, focusing his telescope more closely," get a clear view of Charles and Tina (p. 10).8 Later we are told that Dr. Grogan had "an elegant little brass telescope on a table in the bow window" (p. 160). Is Dr. Grogan, then, the local spy? Possibly. It is certainly not the narrator; or, if it is, he loses his telescope sometime before the ending, where he says he cannot tell whether Sarah Wood- ruff has tears in her eyes, "because she is too far away from me to tell" (p. 479). Both Fowles and Nabokov are marvelous at evoking the cona- tive-affective quality of even the most bizarre situations and mani- festing eroticism without being vulgar or pornographic. Also, both make salient certain signs and symbols that help to focus the mean- ing; for example, the "puddle" in Bend Sinister and the "mirror" in Pale Fire function like the "ammonite" in The French Lieutenant's Woman. That ammonite, which appears frequently in the novel,9 symbolizes the dead world of the past and suggests that anyone who refuses to change and adapt is himself a fossil.

Olshen may be correct in seeing the theme of the novel as the dissolution of Victorianism and the beginning of modernism, but his claim that it shows "an existential aware- ness before it was chronologically possible" (p. 71) is a moot point. Existentialism is merely a modern term for a kind of insight that has been manifested in various ways throughout the ages (cf., Euripides, Tacitus, Duns Scotus, John Donne, Robert Browning, etc.). 6John Fowles, preface to Poems (New York: Ecco Press, 1973), p. vii. 7Strong Opinions, p. 16. 8Parenthetical page references in the text are to The French Lieutenant's Woman (Boston: Little, Brown, 1969). 9Cf. pp. 155, 216, 219, 247, 251, 298, 301, 344, 348, 474, passim. 192 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">his Victorian commitment to Ernestina, the text says, "He was one of life's victims, one more ammonite caught in the vast movements of history, stranded now for eternity, a potential turned into a fossil" (p. 344). With that image Fowles makes central to the novel Darwin's view of adaptation and converts it into an existentialist technique for survival.10 Thus Fowles looks at the Victorian period from a mod- ernist perspective. Many critics have observed that The French Lieutenant's Woman is a Victorian novel in a double sense -in subject matter and narrative manner. The fact that there are more than seventy epi- graphs from Victorian literature (mostly from Hardy) is an obvious indication." As Olshen notes, the novel provides "an intimate and accurate evocation of ... the Victorian Golden Age. . . . Costume, manners, and decor are described with precision."12 But Fowles did not want merely to reproduce the age; he wanted to condemn it. As he said in an interview with James Campbell, "by mid-Victorian times [people] had become terribly pious and phony. . . . And that was when the Rossetti thing came in . . . a very good symbol of a breakthrough. ... standing up ... really, and saying, there's some- thing sick about this age, and we've got to become more human, more sensuous."13 The matter (i.e., the plot) is as follows: From a vantage point in the 1960s, the narrator looks back on Charles Smith- son, an idle aristocrat who in 1867 accompanies his fiancee, Ernes- tina Freeman, daughter of a London merchant, on her annual visit to an aunt in the Dorset seaside village of Lyme Regis. An amateur Dar- winian, Charles goes fossil hunting in the Edenic setting of Ware Common, where he encounters Sarah Woodruff, a sensual, intelli- '0Fowles, however, errs in thinking that Darwin did not fully understand that his theory upset the "Linnaean Scala Naturae . . . nulla species nova ... the Linnaean obsession with classifying and naming, with fossilizing the existent [was] a foredoomed attempt to stabilize and fix what is in reality a continuous flux, and it seems highly appropriate that Linnaeus himself finally went mad" (p. 58). For a dif- ferent view see Stephen Jay Gould, "Darwin's Delay," Natural History, 83 (Decem- ber 1974), 68-70. "The only epigraph that is not by or about Victorians occurs at the head of the last chapter; it is from Martin Gardner's The Ambidextrous Universe (1967). It is ap- propriate to understanding Charles (but probably not Sarah) because it says that chance cooperates with natural law to "create living forms better and better adapted to survive" (p. 474). Given Sarah's repudiation of heterosexual commitments, it is unlikely that she will from that point on "create living forms," whereas Charles plunges into "the river of life" (p. 480). 12Olshen, p. 64.

At that moment, says the narrator, "the whole Victorian age was lost" (p. 81), for Charles be- came obsessed by a desire to help Sarah and felt himself a "Byron tamed" (p. 139) by Ernestina. When an elderly uncle disinherits him by marrying, Charles feels socially inferior to Tina, and he responds to Sarah's plea for help when she is dismissed from the employ of Mrs. Poultenoy, the moral tyrant of Lyme Regis. His friend, Dr. Grogan, warns him against further compromise with the "hope- less case" who "wants to be a sacrificial victim" (p. 166), but Charles plans a tryst with her in Exeter en route back from a confrontation with Tina's father in London. In a London fog, Charles feels insulted by Mr. Freeman's offer of a position in his firm, visits a whore house in the company of former fellow students, and dashes his servant Sam's hopes of opening his own little shop. But he decides not to see Sarah and to "become a fossil" by doing his duty by Tina -"and so ends the story" (p. 348). But Fowles shifts back to "the moment of choice" (p. 351) and has Charles order Sam to stop at Exeter, where he experiences a pas- sionate ninety-second sexual encounter with Sarah-and discovers that she is a virgin! Her story of seduction by the French lieutenant was a lie, and Charles resolves to marry her. He returns to Lyme Regis and horrifies all the proper Victorians by breaking off his en- gagement to Tina. But Charles cannot find Sarah, because the venge- ful servant Sam sabotaged the delivery of his letter and is rewarded with a position in Mr. Freeman's London shop. At this point the nar- rator rejects the option of leaving the story with an open ending and proceeds to structure two equally valid conclusions, the order of which is determined by a flip of a coin. After an intensive search for Sarah fails, Charles travels for two years until his solicitors cable him in America that Sarah has been found. In May, 1869, he encounters Sarah again and is shocked to find that she has become an amanuen- sis and model for the notorious Rossetti, a "new woman," electric and bohemian, with a two-year-old child. But they embrace with the conviction "that the rock of ages can never be anything but love" (p. 472). But Fowles switches to a second ending in which Charles is outraged at the discovery of her lies and at her declaration, "I cannot love you as a wife must" (p. 477). He feels painfully reborn and alone goes "out again, upon the unplumb'd, salt, estranging sea" of life (p. 480). However, though the matter is Victorian - an excellent fictional expos6 of the period - the manner is pseudo-Victorian and, curiously, 194 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">also pseudomodern. As Dwight Eddins notes, Fowles does not imi- tate so much as parody the omniscient Victorian narrator.14 In a typi- cal nineteenth-century novel (e.g., Thackeray's Vanity Fair), the nar- rator creates a fictional world and holds the strings of the puppets he places in that world. Nabokov plays that role - "My characters are all galley slaves,""' and Fowles seems to do the same: "It's silly to say a novelist isn't God ... because the fact is that when you write a book, you are the total dictator. . . . It's very difficult for a character ... to stand up to you and say, you cannot do that, or, I demand that that line be changed." Nevertheless, he confesses, "I never feel quite at home as the omniscient narrator."'' In French Lieutenant's Woman he adopts a perspective that seems omniscient (e.g., "Charles knew nothing of the beavered German Jew [Marx] quietly working S... that very afternoon in the British Museum library," p. 19), and he answers his own question "Who is Sarah?" (p. 103) with "I do not know" (p. 104). Why? For two specious reasons -one which Fowles honestly believes and one which is a deliberate trick on the reader. Fowles, as the section on existentialism in The Aristos makes clear, is genuinely committed to the concept of existentialist freedom; therefore, as a novelist, he feels that "to be free myself, I must give [Charles], and Tina, and Sarah, even the abominable Mrs. Poulte- noy, their freedoms as well. There is only one good definition of God: the freedom that allows other freedoms to exist" (p. 106). Hence, in this pseudo-Victorian novel, the narrator must simply ap- pear to be omniscient and omnipotent - "to pretend. But I live in the age of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Roland Barthes; if this is a novel, it cannot be a novel in the modern sense of the word" (p. 104)- and he wants French Lieutenant's Woman to be a modern novel! Critics have been baffled by Fowles's apparent inconsistencies: Prescott Evarts finds him "eccentric . . . . puzzling and disturbing"; Ian Adams notes "problems of confusion . .. from a commentator who does not always see himself as an authority"; and Walter Allen is exasperated by the "boring red herring" of the pseudomodern nar- rator who wears a disguise concealing a traditional historical novel.17 14Dwight Eddins, "John Fowles: Existence as Authorship," Contemporary Literature, 17 (1975), 217.

Rankin provides an admirable summary of previous criticism in "Cryptic Coloration in The French Lieutenant's Woman," Journal of Narrative Technique, 3 (1973), 193-94. FOWLES | 195</page><page sequence="6">The best critical discussion of this issue is Elizabeth D. Rankin's; she claims that there is "a crafty method to his madness": If the narrator of The French Lieutenant's Woman is obsessed with any one idea, it is with the idea of dead worlds. His story is about a dying era, his hero is a member of a dying breed, and his hero's own preoccupation is with fossils-remnants of numerous dead worlds. Thus, fearful of creating his own dead world, and mindful of the laws laid down by the French creators of the nouveau roman, our narrator determines to write a novel which, though exquisitely planned, does not fully reveal its planning. Since the purposes of his novel require an omniscient narrator, however, . . . [he must] pretend to know his characters' minds .... There is a Darwinian term for this tactic: cryptic coloration . . . [which is] "survival by learning to blend with one's surroundings-with the unquestioned assumptions of one's age or social caste."'8 Of course, the postmodernist writers are most absurd when they disclaim responsibility for the behavior of their characters and refuse to seal their fictional worlds off from the real world in a completed form. But Fowles wants to be a genuine existentialist - and a didactic one. Therefore, he cannot, like Nabokov, openly acknowledge that he is an "anthropomorphic deity." He tricks the reader into believing that his characters are free (as Conchis tricked Nicholas in The Magus and as Sarah tricks Charles in French Lieutenant's Woman) for the purpose of having the reader experience uncertainty and learn the hazards of living in an unplanned universe. As Dwight Eddins points out, Fowles's claims of ontological equality between author, characters, and reader are all arrant sophistry, to be sure, but of a dramatically instructive sort. ... The reader-persona is able to identify with the author-persona insofar as he shares the latter's dilemma over how to give his characters the maximum degree of freedom; and with the characters insofar as he must also fall victim to the beneficent manipulations of the author-persona. These manipulations are, of course, designed to effect an initiation into hazard for both reader-persona and characters. ... Charles's final plunge into the city's "iron heart" is the reader-persona's plunge from the comfort of art, an ordered Victorian metaphor, into the unadorned chaos of reality.'9 18Rankin, pp. 195-96. 19Eddins, pp. 218, 222. 196 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">But this will not do. No genuine artist commits the fallacy of imitative form by making a novel that is simply a mirror-image of the "unadorned chaos of reality." And no reader with intellectual integ- rity will appreciate being tricked and patronized by a guru who, in- stead of telling him the truth, manipulates him with lies. That re- sembles "bad faith" more than the authenticity of a genuine existen- tialist (i.e., resembles Camus' Clamence in La Chute rather than Rieux in La Peste). Elizabeth Rankin deals with that objection by claiming that "we, like Charles, should see below the surface and realize that we have been manipulated all along. Charles's experience differs from ours in that his manipulation was not planned by an omniscient authority S. .. and not out of any selfish need, but simply for the purpose of constructing a meaningful world."20 Perhaps a good reader is never really deceived and, indeed, actually enjoys playing a game of tricks and deceptions with an author who, like Nabokov, winks at the reader. But where is Fowles's wink in French Lieutenant's Woman? He is not playing games when he asserts in his "Notes on an Un- finished Novel" that his characters do really have autonomy over their own lives.21 Rankin claims that the narrator's lies to the reader parallel-and serve the same purpose as-Sarah's lies to Charles: to achieve the realization that "there is no intervening god" and that we make our own lives "within our hazard-given abilities" (pp. 479-80). Life is merely "the actions of men (and of women) in pursuit of their ends" (p. 480); hence, it is a perpetual mystery, since "a planned world . . . is a dead world" (p. 105). That is all well and good, but Charles and Sarah have a personal relationship within the same (albeit fictional) time-space world; their lives are interrelated and hence subject to Fowles's notion of existential authenticity. Since the narrator and the reader have no such intimate relationship, perhaps Fowles feels absolved of the same moral norm. Nevertheless, decep- tion and manipulation always have the effect of converting an "I-Thou" relationship into an "I-It" relationship. It may be that if the goal is the liberation, genuine vitality, and well-being of the other the manipulation is justified. Eddins believes that to be the case with the author-reader relationship, and it may be true, especially since that can never be a genuine "I-Thou" relationship in any case. But does that justify Sarah's manipulations of Charles? 20Rankin, p. 206. 21John Fowles, "Notes on an Unfinished Novel," in Afterwords: Novelists on Their Novels, ed. Thomas McCormack (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), p. 162. FOWLES | 197</page><page sequence="8">The fact that the novel is entitled The French Lieutenant's Woman suggests that Sarah Woodruff is the central character, and indeed the principal action evolves from her plots and schemes. But the focus of the narrator's camera eye is Charles Smithson, and the reader comes to know Sarah only as Charles comes to know her. The change in Charles as a result of that knowledge is what the novel is all about. Fowles himself has said that the theme of the novel is the edu- cation and shaping of an existentialist, and the one so shaped is Charles. However one looks at it, Sarah remains an enigma until the very end, whereas we know all there is to know about Charles's status, motives, and feelings at any given moment (which, inciden- tally, confirms that the narrator's omniscience is highly selective). There are three possible ways of regarding Sarah: (1) the narra- tor tells the truth when he says, "Modern women like Sarah exist, and I have never understood them" (p. 104); hence, Sarah must remain an enigma. Olshen, among others, believes that she remains "essentially unfathomable" (p. 87) and that her function in the novel is to serve as a catalyst for the development of Charles. (2) She is, as Dr. Grogan diagnoses her, a psychopathic personality. (3) She is, as Dwight Eddins and Jeff Rackham believe, an intelligent woman who uses whatever tactics she feels necessary to liberate herself from a society and a culture that oppress, constrain, and stifle her. It is possible, but not probable, that Fowles has intuitively fashioned a meaningful character who remains for him ambiguous and unfathomable. It is more likely that his protestation that he does not understand her is merely part of the larger fraud that constitutes the famous chapter thirteen. The narrator constantly feigns ignor- ance, adopts various disguises, lies to the reader - that is his narrative gambit. But he knows full well who these people are and what they are doing - after all, he created them. The most fully developed explanation of Sarah's actions within the novel is Dr. Grogan's (chapters 19, 27-28). But he is eventually discredited as an eccentric rather than a Whig Darwinian, a man who ultimately functions in terms of Victorian morality when he casti- gates Charles for breaking off his engagement with Tina. He says Charles fails the test of a "finer and fairer morality" and becomes merely one of the "victims of their own baser desires" (p. 409). That would serve to repudiate his Laingian diagnosis of Sarah as one who "has fallen in love with being a victim of fate" (p. 232) and who, not out of evil but despair, exploits Charles's romantic sensibility. He draws a parallel between Sarah and the infamous psychopathic Marie de Morell who deceived and exploited the innocent French lieu- 198 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">tenant, Emile de Ronciere, in 1835; so he proposes that they put Sarah in a private asylum in Exeter. The narrator, however, in an elaborate footnote (p. 245) takes pains to point out that Grogan did not know the whole truth about that other French lieutenant, a fact which further discredits his diagnosis of Sarah. That leaves us with the view of Sarah as existential heroine. Jeff Rackham sees her lies and manipulations of Charles as perfectly jus- tified: "In the best existential manner, Sarah has created a new self by her own choice, an authentic self . . . freed from petty morals and conventions. ... Not only has her freedom not been forced upon her by circumstances, the circumstances themselves have been in- vented by her."22 Dwight Eddins endorses that view: "She is sick only in that she carries the germ of the next, emerging age .... Her decision to use certain stratagems and even to manipulate people is made precisely in order to achieve an authenticity involving freedom from being manipulated by society. . . . She uses Charles and aban- dons him when he has become a threat to her existential growth."23 Such a view of Sarah is in keeping with the Darwinian concepts and imagery that inform the novel, and may very well be what Fowles in- tended. Sarah is a mutant for her time, a new species of woman who does not fit into the rigid Victorian social system, and her survival may require "cryptic coloration." She is a pre-modern woman who in turn creates of Charles a pre-modern man. Their only means of sur- vival is to find environments favorable to their new identities - Sarah in the Rossetti household and Charles in America. But there are weaknesses in such a radical-chic view of the novel. For one thing, Sarah's principal victim, far from being an enemy and a threat to her survival, is a friend -even a lover who is ready and willing to make great sacrifices for her and to adapt to her very strange, antisocial way of life. When Eddins cites Charles as "a threat to her existential growth," does he imply that a true existen- tialist cannot with integrity and authenticity make a commitment to heterosexual love and family life? That would be nonsense, as any reader of Camus' L'Homme Revolti and La Peste knows! The truth seems to be that Sarah seeks freedom not to develop her own creative potentialities or to make her own independent commitment to love and vitality. She seeks freedom to avoid making commitments, at least heterosexual commitments! Surely Fowles is not endorsing that. 22Jeff Rackham, "John Fowles: The Existentialist Labyrinth," Critique, 13 (1972), 100-101. 23Eddins, pp. 220-21. FOWLES 199</page><page sequence="10">In Chapter 19, the deceitful narrator describes Sarah sleeping with the maid Millie and raises the possibility that Sarah may be a Lesbian. He immediately rejects such a notion as absurd: "she was, I think, as innocent as makes no matter" (p. 168) and describes the "coming together" of these two women as "closer to humanity than perversity" (p. 170). Now Sarah may not be a Lesbian, but in the con- clusion when deceptions are no longer necessary to achieve her ends she describes herself thus: "I do not wish to marry. . . . I do not want to share my life. I wish to be what I am, not what a husband, how- ever kind, however indulgent, must expect me to become in marriage" (pp. 462-63). Such an attitude prompts Charles to the final realization of "his own true superiority to her: which was not of birth, or education, not of intelligence, not of sex, but of an ability to give that was also an inability to compromise" (p. 478, italics mine). If it is true that the novel focuses primarily on Charles and depicts his existentialist education and liberation, then his final insight must be considered accurate and his repudiation of Sarah justified. An inevi- table consequence of such a reading is that a reader cannot endorse Sarah's inability to give. Such a view requires that the final ending be accepted as the right one. The narrator repudiated (a) a Victorian ending with Charles marrying Tina (pp. 350-51), (b) a postmodernist "open, in- conclusive ending" (p. 417), and (c) a romantic ending because "a thousand violins cloy very rapidly without percussion" (p. 473), all in favor of (d) the existentialist ending in which Charles is plunged into the "river of life, of mysterious laws and mysterious choice" (p. 480). But the narrator remains deceitful to the very end, claiming that "the only way I can take no part in the fight is to show you two versions of it" (p. 417). He never confesses that he did not really flip a coin to determine the sequence of the last two endings. But as Elizabeth Rankin astutely observes, the careful reader will see that "behind the facade of the freedom-giving narrator-novelist, there still lurks a clever puppet-master and an adept manipulator of audiences."24 The final ending that endorses Charles and repudiates Sarah is the "real" one because: "(1) it is the only ending which is not undercut by the novel, and (2) it is the logical conclusion toward which the novel has been moving since page one. . . . It is absolutely essential that the novel end with Charles's rebirth, so that it can offer a model of exis- tential freedom which will serve as a moral norm."25 24Rankin, p. 203. 25Rankin, pp. 205-6. 200 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">What conclusion about Fowles and the modern novel can we draw from all this? Certain postmodernists would have us dispense with the question of meaning altogether. Witold Gombrowicz, for example, is exasperated by it: "What a bore is the everlasting ques- tion: What did you mean ... ? Come, come, be more sensuous, less cerebral, start dancing with a book instead of asking for meanings."26 Others, like Frank Kermode, are not ready to do anything so irra- tional as to dance with a book, but nevertheless value its secrets more than its controlled meanings. Kermode is irked by the fact that "it seems to many people perverse to deny the author possession of an authentic and normative sense of what he has said. . . . There is pub- lic demand for . . problems rationally soluble." He repudiates these people in favor of readers for whom "the nature of parable and per- haps of narrative in general is to be 'open'. . . [to] change endlessly since the world is endlessly capable of being redescribed. And this is a way of saying that they must always have their secrets." That is be- cause "all narrators are unreliable. . . . The trouble is not that there are unreliable narrators, but that we have endorsed the fiction of the 'reliable' narrator."'27 Such an attitude seems chic and has wide acceptance in this post- modernist era. However, rationality is a virtue that we must not abandon. To be sure, we cannot use it to solve all the problems and reveal all the secrets of real life. But fiction is not reality; unlike reality, it is created by an artist who is, or ought to be, in control of the human experience he is embodying in language. The real world is, of course, endlessly capable of being redescribed, but a specific, con- sciously created fictional world is not. Hence, if The French Lieu- tenant's Woman is to be considered a genuine work of literary art, we must assume that the narrator who deceives and keeps secrets from the reader is not the same person as the real John Fowles, who arranges things so that the reader can see through him in the same way that Charles eventually sees through Sarah. I do not believe it is true, as Kermode claims, that all narrators are unreliable, but even if it were, the narrator is not the author.
