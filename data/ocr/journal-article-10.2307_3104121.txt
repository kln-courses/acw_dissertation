<plain_text><page sequence="1">thought-provoking selections by such-persons as Seneca, Saint Francis of Assisi, William Penn, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mohandas Gandhi, Aldous Huxley, and Lewis Mumford, the general tendency of which is typified by Gandhi's comment that "civilization, in the real sense of the term, consists not in the multiplication, but in the deliberate and voluntary reduction of wants." The book begins with a preface by Schumacher arguing the case for a "curved logic" capable of demon- strating that many goals and preferences that are highly valued in our society are viable only "up to a point" after which "straight-line pro- jections" become inherently self-defeating. This is true, according to Schumacher, of such things as economic progress, the complication of life, the pursuit of efficiency and productivity, and use of nonrenew- able resources, specialization, and the substitution of "scientific method" for common sense. We often need "straight-line logic" to help us live, and VandenBroeck's selections concur by emphasizing the important difference between voluntarily limiting oneself to what one really needs in order to maintain a modest but adequate standard of living on the one hand and being in a state of actual destitution and want on the other. But "curved logic" can help us find why living is actually worthwhile and restore a badly needed sense of purpose which a philosophy of materialism is powerless to supply. In sum, these two books are straws in a wind that blows directly counter to many assumptions that have until recently been taken so much for granted in our affluence-oriented society as to be practically unquestioned in matters affecting public policy. I found them very stimulating and wish for them a wide readership in this time of so- bering realities and changing priorities. W. DAVID LEWIS* Apollo Agonistes: The Humanities in a Computerized World. Edited by M. E. Grenander. Proceedings, Institute for Humanistic Studies, SUNY at Albany, April 19-21, 1979. Albany, N.Y.: Institute for Humanistic Studies, 1979. Pp. 1-216 (vol. 1), pp. 217-443 (vol. 2). $10.00 (paper). In April of 1979, forty-six authors (more or less), a small army of moderators, deputies, monitors, academic administrators, and politi- cians, and Joseph Weizenbaum descended on Albany at the invitation of M. E. Grenander, director of the Institute for Humanistic Studies at the State University of New York at Albany and organizer of the three-day conference "Apollo Agonistes: The Humanities in a Com- *DR.

The announced theme of the conference was the following: "The tension between concepts of thought as mechanistic and as uniquely human; the portrayal of computers or similar mech- anisms in literature, art, and history; the uses of the computer in the humanities; and problems of policy involving the humanistic im- plications ... of electronic information flow in the modern world." We now have the full proceedings of that event, lacking Weizen- baum's keynote address, "Computer Science and Prophecy" (a vid- eotape of which is, however, available from the Education Communi- cations Center at SUNY at Albany), but including forty-two papers and the inevitable, but happily brief, comments of various welcoming officials. It is at once obvious that the papers fit the conference's announced theme to a degree that is as admirable as it is uncommon. Fifteen of the forty-two papers deal more or less directly with the use of the computer in humanistic research. These uses range from ex- pected language analyses-for example, of spoken English (Jan Svartvik, Lund University), of a classical Persian poem (Bo Utas, Scandinavian Institute of Asian Studies, Copenhagen), and of William Dean Howells's novels (Howard Kerr, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle)-to an unexpected artistic exploitation of the computer's real-time decision-making capabilities (Myron Krueger, University of Connecticut). With the exception of "Experimental Visible Lan- guages" (Aaron Marcus, University of California, Berkeley), a fas- cinating discussion of new visible language systems made possible by computer-generated graphics, the applications described here were not especially provocative. In part, perhaps in large part, this is a reflection of the brevity of these, as of all of the other, papers. This, in turn, reflects the organizers' decision to make applications of the computer just one element in a mosaic of conference motifs. The outcome might have been very different, even given these same appli- cations, had the conference pivoted about a sustained critical exami- nation of computer applications presented in some detail. Of the twenty-seven papers not dealing with using the computer, thirteen are primarily about computers, while fourteen make general observations about science, technology, rationalism, mechanistic thinking, or 20th-century civilization. With few exceptions, these pa- pers are not, probably could not be, given their brevity, satisfying. H. A. Nielsen (University of Windsor, Ontario) makes a nice attempt at applying Kierkegaard's concept of the self to the computer in "The Limits of Machine Subjectivity," but he barely gets off the mark be- fore having to grind to a halt. Peter Zetterberg's (St. Louis University) "Talking Statues in Elizabethan and Stuart England" could usefully have concentrated on precisely that rich topic, leaving divagations on broader metaphysical issues to another, longer paper. Two of the historical papers-"Leibniz: Precursor of the Computerized World" (F. Kreiling, Polytechnic Institute of New York) and "Lady Lovelace, Book Reviews 705 TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE</page><page sequence="3">the World's First Computer Programmer, and the Boundaries of Computer Programming Concepts" (A. Welsh and P. S. McGarry, Manhattan College)-make reasonably self-contained points, while James Ellsworth's (University of Hawaii at Manoa) claims about the relations between the depiction of automata and the valuation of women in early Greek poetry need amplification to be more convinc- ing. "The Social Function of Music: Quantitative and Qualitative Ap- proaches" (Anna Czekanowska, director of the Institute of Musicol- ogy, University of Warsaw) remains obscure to me even after several readings, perhaps for lack of familiarity with the zonal theory of musical time on which it appears to be predicated. "The Art of Com- puter Programming and the Science of Poetic Design" (David Han- nay, Union College, New York) argues nicely on behalf of a paral- lelism between structured programming, as in the high-level com- puter language PASCAL, and the fashioning of a poem. "Automation in Libraries" (Audrey Dibble, Washington State University) deserves special mention for making several thoughtful and disturbing points about the possible implications for personal academic research of new library technologies and their costs. The majority of the nonapplications papers are, more or less in- tensely, hostile to the computer, either for what its use portends or as an embodiment of a scientistic-technocratic approach to experience and values. Unfortunately, there is also an almost complete absence of papers attempting to derive the human significance of the computer from an analysis of the nature of the computer itself as an artifact. Scragg and Wilkes (Worcester Polytechnic Institute) touch on this in "Psychological Effects of Computers," which raises the general ques- tion of the psychological consequences of using machines, but they barely get beyond the portrayal of the obsessive programmer in Weizenbaum's Computer Power and Human Reason. C. S. Dunn (Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) and S. E. Zimmerman (Carnegie-Mellon University) flirt with this approach in their discussion of the impact of computerized decision making on criminal justice, but only in- cidentally. The humanities unquestionably face a peculiar challenge from the computer, wonderful for being the first human artifact possessing a universal intentionality. This challenge has crystallized in the form of a continuing controversy over research in artificial intelligence and what some see as the antihumanistic, even antihuman, implications of such research. It seems important, then, to identify the initial plausi- bility of the very notion of artificial intelligence. Does it rest, perhaps, in our acquiescence in the anthropomorphic language with which the functioning of the computer is commonly described? We casually de- scribe the computer as "following instructions," "evaluating inputs," "performing operations," "storing information," "choosing between 706 Book Reviews TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE</page><page sequence="4">TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE alternatives," etc. In fact, all of these behaviors are interpretations that we place upon the rigid, signal-transforming activities of the elements of which the computer is composed. The analysis of the computer as artifact might begin with the rec- ognition that "computer" is the name of an ordered array of signal- processing devices, each type of which has its own characteristic way of transforming the signals applied to its input pins into different, or sometimes the same, signals on its output pins. The genius of the computer lies to some extent in the deliberate design of these signal- processing devices, but primarily in the brilliant recognition that cer- tain sets of signal transformations can be interpreted as "giving an- swers" to certain other sets of signals (the inputs) interpretable as "asking questions." This properly focuses attention on interpretation as the essence of the computer's operation, from the organization of its processors with their innate instruction sets, to the design of its programming languages. As interpretation is certainly an activity with which the humanities are familiar and comfortable, so too should the operation of the computer be. The fact that many practical problems have computer inter- pretations is interesting and exciting, but it is not necessarily more significant for the nature of thought, taken by itself, than the fact that truth-tables can determine the validity of an infinite number of puta- tive deductive arguments. The question most naturally posed by the computer is thus not whether computers think but whether human thinking, and what we mean by "consciousness," is also an interpreta- tion of the transformation of input signals by fixed elements of our nervous system. This seems to me very different from the former question, putting the burden of proof on the neural sciences, where the former question puts the burden on philosophical defenses of the uniqueness of thought, self, subjectivity, meaning, value, creativity, significance. If we acquiesce in the validity of the former question, we tacitly acknowledge that computers do function as we think, and then we open ourselves to a reflexive interpretation of human behavior generally, and of thought in particular, in terms of what current computer models are capable of achieving. This, in turn, puts the humanities in a defensive posture vis-a-vis the computer, sensing in its presence a challenge to the legitimacy of its traditional prerogatives in treating human experience. The alternative question is a technical one regarding the logos of the human nervous system, a question that is sufficiently esoteric to free the computer itself from its currently pejorative humanistic affect so that humanists could employ it as a tool. Such foundational questions as these, dealing with the significance of the computer in se and per se for humans and for the humanities, are not materially advanced by the papers of Apollo Agonistes. The questions that the papers do raise, taken together, may constitute an Book Reviews 707</page><page sequence="5">opening broadside in what needs to be a sustained and systematic engagement between the humanities and the computer, which is too readily acknowledged by humanists as an alien instrumentality of scientific-technological analysis. STEVEN Louis GOLDMAN* Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Telecommunications Policy Research Con- ference. Edited by Herbert Dordick. Lexington, Mass.: Lexington Books, 1979. Pp. xiv+475. $21.95. This book is a collection of papers presented at the sixth Airlie House Conference on telecommunications policies, held in 1978. These conferences, judging from the quality of the materials in the book, are of considerable consequence and we must be grateful to Herbert Dordick for making the proceedings available to the general public. As Dordick writes in his preface (p. ix): "The Airlie House Conferences are unique. They are not strictly speaking, a professional gathering or a briefing session. Rather, they contain elements of both. At each meeting there are exchanges of views between researchers. There are also state-of-the-art meetings for nonexperts as well as sessions in which government people can express their needs to the research community. Finally, there are sessions that combine all three of these functions." More than 300 people attended the 1978 conference which focused on four topics. These were: (1) television's social effects and the policy issues they create; (2) computer communication and the emerging information economy; (3) spectrum allocation; and (4) the economics of regulation and pricing telecommunications services. Although the conference dealt with four topics, it is the first two which are given major attention in the book. The section on televi- sion's social effects has seventeen chapters and 224 pages, or ap- proximately half the book. The section on computers and the in- formation economy has nine chapters and about 125 pages, and the remaining two sections are squeezed into the last 125 pages. My de- scription of the structure of the book is not meant as a criticism but is given to show how the book is organized and what it emphasizes. The latter two sections are highly technical and probably are of interest only to experts in the areas dealt with. The quality of the material in the book is exceptionally and uni- formly high. The section on television's social effects, for example, has a number of important articles on how children learn about race and social roles from television, its influence on their notions about *DR.
