<plain_text><page sequence="1">XLIX THE TEMPEST THERE is always a particular interest attaching to the last work of a great author; and in an especial degree this has been the case with Shakespeare. If The Tempest was not really his last play, it would seem that it ought to have been. The action now and then lags a bit, and gives the people on the stage or in the audience a chance to ponder; which the chief character once does to such effect that his speech, of purest and highest poetry, seems to be the "conclusion of the whole matter," der Weisleit letzter Schluss. And there are meetings and leave-takings, and glances into the past and at what is to come. Yet I cannot believe that there is any allegory, or symbolism, or even "veiled biography" here. The Tempest, like every other Shakespearean or popular Elizabethan drama, stands like a tub on its own bottom, is a story in its own right and for its own sake; and unless the intention of the author be of no primary importance, and meanings be not derived from the text but imparted to it, this must be only a rather simpler story of his than usual, a sort of glorified fairy-tale on the stage, precious, not indeed, because of the structure or situations, but because of the charac- ters, the poetry, and the rich and dreamy spirit which for the most part informs it. That the story is slight is no proof that there is another within or behind it. And Prospero is not Shakespeare any more than (as fewer think) he is James I, save in the sense that the dramatist, not the mon- arch, created him; his "potent art" of magic is not the art of poetry; Ariel is not genius, or the lawless imagination, craving liberty but kept in ser- vitude; Miranda is not the drama; Caliban, not the vulgar public; Milan, not Stratford; and the enchanted isle, not the stage, or London, or the world. The late Stuart Sherman once said' that he was sorry for those who do not believe something of the sort; and though thus I am doing only what he was doing, as well as all other people who venture to pity the be- nighted, I am tempted in turn to be sorry for those-despite all their name and number-who believe it. Drama, and character, and poetry, do not content them; Shakespeare himself, I fear, does not content them; and with the noble simplicity wherewith "the author writ" they will not read. They have the latter-day taste for an inner meaning, biographical or symbolical; and both in a last work and in any of moment they expect to find a "message." Not only do I think such an interpretation unwar- ranted by the text and the spirit of the poet, I think it actually troubles and disturbs the artistic effect. 1The Nation (N. Y.), April 27, 1916, p. 459. 699</page><page sequence="2">"The Tempest" Above all is this true of the characters, especially the mythical ones most eagerly seized upon as symbols-Ariel and Caliban. Where does the beauty or greatness of these creations lie if not in their reality? They are not single abstractions personified, but many-sided conceptions incar- nated. They are not spirits such as are to be found in Shelley's verse dramas, but beings more actual and convincing than Miranda and Ferdi- nand themselves. In short, they are not dull or inconceivable as the su- pernatural and allegorical in poetry generally are. Each has his own ac- cent, and personal air, and point of view. Each is interesting in his own right, not by a sort of reversion. And never has the plastic power of the poet asserted itself more emphatically and fruitfully than here, where he had no models in nature to follow. It is as with the fairies in A Midsum- mer Night's Dream, the Weird Sisters and the ghosts in Macbeth and Hamlet. "Certainly the greatness of this author's genius," says Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's earliest editor and himself an excellent dramatist, "does nowhere so much appear as where he gives his imagination an entire loose, and raises his fancy to a flight above mankind and the limits of the visible world." For, above mankind (or, in Caliban's case, be- neath it), these creations are, with an appropriate difference, fashioned after its similitude, and are as fully moulded and as strikingly delineated. To be works of art, Shakespeare's ghosts, fates, and sprites are, like the angels and demons of Dante and Milton, and the gods and goddesses of Homer and Virgil, made human, though proportionately.2 And how by allegory these clear outlines would be troubled, these solid forms dis- solved! Besides, like the ghosts and the Weird Sisters, these two beings are plainly indicated as developments out of popular superstitious concep- tions, which are concrete. If Shakespeare meant allegory or symbol he strangely misled his audience, thinking only of the critics. In Ariel the tradition is double: he is a sprite like Puck, who gladly serves the king of fairies; and he is the "familiar spirit" of a magician, whom he serves unwillingly. And Caliban is a mooncalf, offspring of a witch and a devil, a conception still current as late as Dryden's day. Unlike, and con- trasted, as they are, they have, as the simple denizens of earth and air some traits in common: an aversion to labor and longing for liberty; a primitive sense of humor and fondness for tricks and pranks; a childish pleasure in tastes and sounds, sights and lights; a spontaneous love of nature; and (deeper within them) a fear of a higher power, on the one hand, and a craving for affection and approbation, on the other. 2 Lessing (Hamburgische Dramaturgie I, Stticke 11, 12) complains of the ghost in Vol- taire's Semiramis that it is not poetical-human-enough. 700</page><page sequence="3">Elmer Edgar Stoll 2 Ariel is like Puck before him in the enjoyment of his own performances, and of their effects on mortals. He mimics Ferdinand "cooling of the air with sighs, and sitting, his arms in this sad knot"; and it is with delight that he tells of Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban, like colts pricking up their ears and lifting up their noses, as by his music they are led through briars and thorns into the horsepond. As with Puck, it is by mimicry that he misleads them-that of dogs barking, cocks crowing, a cow low- ing or a horse neighing; of drums beating, bells ringing, or people singing or calling. What but the mimicry, indeed, can make this a fitting em- ployment for a personification of Shakespeare's genius? And like Puck and the other fairies he rejoices in movement, drinks the air before him, and cries, "I go, I go," as eager as the wind. Yet this is the celerity, not of thought, but of a sprite, swifter than the moones sphere. He is more ethereal, however, than the fairies. He is not naughty or mischievous; the conspirators whom he pesters deserved what they got. And he pities the unhappy, or comes as near to doing so as a careless sprite well can. He is kept a bit aloof, like nature. He does not laugh at lovers- Lord! what fools these mortals be!- for he is not of the earth-a "lob of spirits"-but of the air; as, indeed, his name, falsely etymologized, would signify, as Prospero explicitly remarks, and as his sports and occupations clearly indicate. He runs, if need be, upon the sharp wind of the north, but prefers the bat's back, after summer merrily. He flies and sings invisible, and flames amazement with St. Elmo's fire. He palpitates with eagerness, What shall I do? Say, what. What shall I do? and again and again he inquires, Do you love me, master, no? His work is play, and yet he is continually longing for liberty. He is a wild thing, though by fear and gratitude he has been a little tamed. As is remarked by Coleridge3 (to whom, as to Hazlitt, Ariel is a myth and no more), he represents a power of nature, like wind or water, harnessed for the time to man's service, and delighting in it, yet ever ready to break loose. In service and at liberty alike he is eager and impetuous-he is the wind blowing, the stream flowing. Prospero will miss him but he will not miss Prospero. "My bird," Prospero calls him; but the cage opened-the spell broken-he at once takes flight. And though in the mysterious mak- a See Raysor's Coleridge's Shakespearean Criticism (1930), II, 176. I have a bit modified the poet's thought. 701</page><page sequence="4">"The Tempest" ing of him there has been some process of abstraction, this is a poet's, a myth-maker's, which cannot stop short of a full corporeal existence, as is time and again the case with Shakespeare's personifications. Such they are indeed: witness, in a single scene: And pity, like a naked new-born babe Striding the blast ... Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls on the other ... Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress'd yourself? Hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale? Sprung, now, out of a creation of popular superstition (though refined and vivified anew), and taken to be a myth of nature by the Eliza- bethans, by one of the greatest of modern poets, and for that matter (though in simpler fashion) by any schoolboy who can read, Ariel, who earns his freedom and blissfully wings his way back to the elements, has, by the accepted interpretation, been turned into something which, ac- cording to all the poets' testimony, takes flight, to be sure, but never by their permission! Were he imagination or genius, would he bury himself in the bosom of nature, to sing, unlike the skylark, songs nevermore to be heard? Or if in this character he is to be conceived as the spirit of earth and sky, visiting and inspiring the soul of a poet, is not that an idea fit for a Romantic like Wordsworth or Shelley- Make me thy lyre, as the forest is!- rather than the playwright? If external, his genius resided in the world of men. 3 The chief and determining cause of this blindness to the probabilities of the case and the poet's purpose, is the other matter, already touched upon, which likewise eluded the poetical perception of Coleridge and Hazlitt, though not of our all-discerning age-that Prospero is the poet himself and his magic no magic at all. It is the poet's art. The apostrophe to the elves, by whose aid he has bedimmed the noontide sun and waked sleepers from their graves, is his farewell to it; the breaking of the wand and burying of the book is his abandonment of the stage; and the Milan to which he is triumphantly returning is Stratford. This opinion is now well-nigh a dogma. By Masefield, Lytton Strachey, and Schiicking it is not accepted; but in some form or other it is by the other Germans- Ulrici may have been its originator-and of course by the biographical- minded Brandes and Harris, as also by Lowell, Dowden, and Churton 702</page><page sequence="5">Elmer Edgar Stoll Collins, and even by Chambers, Bailey, and Mackail,4 present-day critics of great and merited renown. Sir Edmund then goes so far as to suggest that Ariel, though also the agent of an inscrutable Providence, may be a symbol of the spirit of poetry found pegged in the cloven pine of Pre-Shakespearean drama.5 There is the trouble with the criticism by impression, rather than interpretation, which still prevails. Every one having a right to his own opinion, Ariel must be anything that he is taken to be, and consequently, in the upshot, is nothing at all. Thus criticism becomes a contradiction in terms. Thus meanings are no meanings, but labels attached; and a work of art is no longer art-a means of expres- sion-but an emblem like the flag or the eagle, the cross or the crescent. Yet is not a critic (KpLmtK6S) a judge, who does not explore his own consciousness, but determines the author's meaning or intention, as if the poem were a will, a contract, or the constitution? The poem is not the critic's own. If such be the case, there is little basis even for the idea, pivotal in the accepted interpretation, that Prospero is the poet. And why should Lon- don, or the Globe theatre, or "Man's universe," be a "desert" (or unin- habited) isle, peopled only by Ariel, Miranda, and Caliban; and Stratford and repose be adumbrated by Milan and the duchy which the poet is again to govern? The audience (and in Shakespeare's life-time there were for this play no readers) would have been very considerably at sea! Alle- gory or symbolism cannot, like dreams, go by contraries; and is the dreariest of failures if, even at the time, it do not fit. Or if, in lieu of that, it be not supported by a long-established convention, as with the shepherd's trade for the poet's ever since the days of Theocritus; and there is nothing of convention here. Magic has no such traditional asso- ciation with poetry. How is this to be taken for anything else than what 4 Professor Mackail and Mr. Bailey, however, have misgivings, and make reservations in keeping with their general antipathy to such a critical process. Cf. Approach to Shake- speare, pp. 104-105; Shakespeare, in the "English Heritage" Series, pp. 204-205.-It seems necessary to cite these recent critics, for several years ago I was charged by a learned reviewer with performing a needless task-slaying monsters of error already dead. I Shakespeare: A Survey (1925) p. 310.-It is only fair to notice that Sir Edmund is here not so confident as in the matter that Prospero, when bidding farewell to the elves and breaking his staff, is Shakespeare. See below, p. 707. But if company and countenance be what is lacking, he now has it, and of the best. Mr. Middleton Murry (Criterion, Oct., 1931) is of the opinion that Hamlet is, besides the story of the Dane, an allegory of Shake- speare's own difficulties as a dramatist; and "Hamlet's final appeal to Horatio 'to tell my story' is Shakespeare's appeal to the well-conditioned critic ... to understand the con- ditions under which he laboured, rebelled, submitted, and triumphed" (p. 124). Can these dying but undying words mean this and-any longer be such? The interpretation is as disturbing to drama and poetry as that of Ibsen, Milton, and Goethe below (pp. 708-11), and as little warranted by the text. 703</page><page sequence="6">"The Tempest" it is manifestly intended, and would certainly be understood, to be-the magic (though the white variety) of the time of James I (author of the Demonology, hunter of witches) with its paraphernalia of robe, wand, and book; the magic of Greene, Marlowe, Dekker, Jonson, Middleton, Ford, and Rowley, of Lope and Calder6n, which, like Prospero's, but by no means Shakespeare's, must be "abjured"? Nowadays we do not believe in it as an "art" (and for that if for no other reason we turn it into a metaphor here); but nearly everybody so believed in it then.6 Nowadays "magic" and "spell," "enchantment" and "incantation," "witchcraft" and "witchery," are stock metaphors in the critic's vocabulary; but they were not then. Of the farewell to the elves Wolff remarks that "the poet gives back to the elements the genii who for twenty years have been in his service." "Where," asks Schiicking, "do we find Shakespeare or one of his circle speaking of his dramatic abilities as genii?" Where, I would add, does Shakespeare ever speak-save in his sonnets, and then vaguely and deprecatingly-of his dramatic art at all? And the raising of the dead had been a function of sorcery since the days of the Witch of Endor; this reference to it, like the apostrophe as a whole, is taken from the abjuration of Medea, in Golding's7 Ovid. How strange that Shakespeare, if renouncing a novel and metaphorical magic, should have adopted the formula of one who is renouncing the real! Did he not greatly care to be understood, until these latter days? The strangest thing of all, however, is the application of the theory to the Epilogue, as undertaken by Dowden, Luce, and a few others. One hopes that those sorry lines are not by Shakespeare; but whether they be or not, they rather show that in his own day no such understanding was intended. An address by the actor of Prospero begging for applause, the Epilogue is nothing more than a series of wire-drawn conceits on the subject of pardon and indulgence, and with Shakespeare's own person- ality and present situation seems to have nothing to do. Yet if anywhere in the play the poet were making his farewell, here, surely, was the place for it, and for his clearest and most telling utterance besides. That the prince of dramatists should make for himself so pitiful an exit, until now no one knowing that it is his! As for the play proper, apart from the objection that the interpretation does not fit the text, there is the other that it is alien from the spirit of Elizabethan popular drama, and of Shakespeare. The popular drama- tists-such as Marlowe, Middleton, Heywood, Beaumont and Fletcher, who also did not print their plays-do not write allegorically, and, save satirically, do not refer to other dramatists, still less to themselves. It 6 See my Shakespeare Studies (1927), the chapter on the Ghosts. 7 Metamorphoses, vii, 197-219 (Luce). 704</page><page sequence="7">Elmer Edgar Stoll would have been out of keeping, and (except the obvious sort sometimes found in Dekker, which is mere Morality) highly perplexing. Allegory then, as symbolism now, was not for the popular stage. Lyly's Endymion was a Court play, and a mythological play-The Tempest is neither-in which compliment and allegory were naturally and traditionally ex- pected. In the Midsummer Night's Dream, which, like The Tempest, indeed, has some of the characteristics of a Court entertainment, there is the compliment to the "imperial votaress"; but that is not allegory of the abstract (or autobiographical) and recondite character we have been noticing, but is concrete and unmistakable. And as Creizenach said of Shakespeare and the Elizabethans in general, and Mornet, of Moliere and the grand siecle, they did not choose materials which offered occasion for personal confessions in the style of Goethe. In Faust the poet in- dubitably appears; but Goethe, as the late Mr. Henry M. Alden once said to me, could not have created an Ariel. Why not? Mr. Alden said it was because he would have given him an ethical turn-which is the same as saying that the poet was too self-cen- tered, too little of a myth-maker to conceive a sprite. He could not like Shakespeare forget himself to the point of thus entering into the soul of a phenomenon of nature. But Ibsen likewise was too self-centered; his grim spirit ever broods over his stage, while Shakespeare's, like a god's in his own world, is, though everywhere, nowhere; and yet as I have said in a previous discussion, I do not think that the Master-Builder, first erecting churches, then homes for human beings, then castles in the air, is an allegory of the author's artistic development-from his early romantic plays, through the social dramas, to the poetical, symbolical ones at the last. Such an idea, like that of Ariel imprisoned in the Pre- Shakespearean drama or of the dramatist's farewell-though far less alien from the mind of the poet concerned, equally so from his art-robs the play of its general and human significance. (For the play is symboli- cal, not allegorical, that is to say, is not a double story but a single one with extensions; and the churches, homes, and castles represent the changing and developing aspirations, not of the writer, but the hero.) Such an idea, though it deals with poetry and drama, is not poetic or dramatic itself. Such an idea, indeed, is not relevant to the story. A scholar, a biographer, more especially the particular one who invented it, might find it interesting, but what audience could? It is for students and readers, and those, I must think, who for the moment (for bad moments we all have) are not the most poetically- minded, either. Even today on the stage it would not be acceptable as applied to The Tempest. The drama is indeed seldom performed: there is too little suspense, and the conjuring tricks pall upon us. But a Prospero 705</page><page sequence="8">"The Tempest" who, after mysteriously freeing the spirit of poetry from the cloven pine and then mysteriously bidding farewell to it-and to the elves as spirits of poetry, too, rather superfluously before that-is now for riding back for good and all to Stratford, would make almost any audience yawn, save one made up of a Shakespeare Society or an Educational Associa- tion at a centenary anniversary. How much more so at the Globe, on the Bankside, where Shakespeare's plays were delighted in but not taken to be literature, and the author of them (when he was thought of at all) was not hailed as a genius, nor was so esteemed by himself. He had worked for a competence, and was now retiring to enjoy it. Though he had yet nearly five years ahead of him he did not take the trouble to see the better half of his plays, still in manu- script, safely into print, or even to correct the garbled versions of the others. In his will he mentions none of them, though concerned who should receive money for mourning-rings, and his bed, his sword, his silver-gilt bowl. He thinks to be remembered by his friends and for him- self, not by the world and for his poems. And it is in such a spirit that he writes. He is not personal. His songs, in the vein of folksong, are perhaps the most objective and dramatically appropriate that ever were penned. And when he did undertake to write of himself it was in son- nets. In style they are so sweet and poignant that they have piqued the curiosity of critics for three hundred years; but in content they are so traditional, or so veiled and obscure, that they have only baffled it. He is not conscious, not critical. He frequently falls into bad taste -in his greatest plays as in the least-and in the later plays lapses into the primitive devices of the first. His virtues are positive, opulent, redundant, not negative or corrective, frugal or austere. He frequently falls into contradictions. not only in matters of time and place, but of fact and circumstance, and even of motive. Here in The Tempest, Luce has observed, the incidents of the wreck as witnessed in the first scene and as reported by Miranda and Ariel in the second, no more har- monize than, as we shall see below, do the features of Caliban. The plays are for an audience, not for print, and the writer is the noblest of opportunists. The most reputable critics recognize that by time and circumstance he has given no opportunity to Desdemona and Cassio for the infidelity that Iago charges them with, and their defence of him is that he knew no ordinary spectator would notice it. Indeed, what is partly carelessness is partly instinctive cunning; and defect is turned to commodity by the system of short time and long time, of scene now here now nowhere in particular, and of "veiled confusion of motive."8 And his development, throughout his career, in structure, 8 Cf. Mr. Robert Bridges' Essay, "On the Influence of the Audience, Stratford Town 706</page><page sequence="9">Elmer Edgar Stoll style and metre, which is continual and enormous, is not according to principle or for novelty's sake. The expression becomes more subtle and various as the conceptions within him take their resistless way, each craving, like a soul when descending upon the planet, a body, unlike any other before or after, of its own. And on these, not the applause of poster- ity, or the sanction of antiquity, or the fine figure that he is cutting in his own eyes, he is intent. He enters into them; but there is endless, fruitless questioning by scholars and critics what he was like himself. He was lost in his creation, as only the very greatest are. He could conceive an Ariel.9 And how impossible to believe (what one of the greatest living Shake- speare critics finds it "impossible to doubt") that one so lost and silent in his work, and personally so little noticed where Jonson and Bacon, and Beaumont and Fletcher were heeded and honored, should, when he sat down to write The Tempest, utter a solemn valediction, as if he were the darling of the metropolis, the acknowledged king of poets, and boast that he had bedimmed The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds, And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire,... and all the rest? At that even Walt Whitman might hesitate, or in his worser moments (as when he compares himself with the dramatist now in question) Mr. Shaw. What was suitable enough for Prospero the magi- cian, addressing the spirits, "by whose aid" he had done it, becomes, in this metaphorical sense, insufferable swagger, preposterous rant. We may make a god of him if we please, but not have him make himself one. The deity cannot be expected to speak quite like a mortal, and we make allowances for him in Paradise Lost and the Iliad; but what a rodomon- tade not only for but also by the most unobtrusive, elusive, and in the world of literature then unappreciated, of men! Only a Freud could ex- plain it, provided he forgot that the man was a humorist, as were likewise his fellow-playwrights. The Tempest was performed at Court, where Jon- son would have seen it; indeed, he afterwards jeered a little at its fairy- tale character;10 but how could the poet, if he had talked of himself like this, have faced the inevitable and ferocious guffaw?

Schticking objects in general to Shakespeare as Prospero because the magician has no sense of humor. The fundamen- tal objection, I think, is, that, should the dramatist have meant any- thing of the sort, he must (like the critics themselves in proposing it) have for the moment flung away his own. 4 The case is different from that of Milton, who certainly here and there appears, under cover of the hero, in another final drama, Samson Ago- nistes. Of himself also he is thinking as blind, among his enemies, the idolaters; and something of his own bitterness against women may give edge to the captive's under the eyes of Dalila. But like Goethe, though after a different fashion, Milton was in general self-centered and some- what lacking in humor, loftily treating himself as chosen not only of the Muse but of God, and once fairly putting himself (though not necessarily as an equal) in the place of Pindar and, again, of Orpheus. And in his son- nets, instead of hinting darkly, and trafficking in riddles, he uttered boldly and frankly whatever he had it in his heart to say. Moreover, in dealing with a Bible character as a prototype of his own, Milton had the warrant not only of the Puritans, who continually called themselves the chosen people, and the prelatists Hittites or Amalekites, but that of homilists for more than a thousand years, as well as even (in relation to the Old Testament) of the evangelists and apostles. Sermons (like criti- cism!) have always kept to the text as a point of departure; and in a sacred drama it was only to be expected that there should be some inner meaning, or "application," as not in a stage play. In any case, by thus somewhat associating himself with the Hebrew bruiser and Nazarite woman-hunter, the haughty old poet cannot be said to be exalting him- self, as here the self-forgetful Shakespeare would certainly be. Indeed, he does not labor the point; and in the tragedy there is nothing that can be called allegory or symbolism. No one that I know of suggests that Dalila is Mary Powell, or Harapha Salmasius. ... I am wrong, as I immediately discover. Turning to William Vaughan Moody's Milton to make sure that for the last name I should not rather have written Morus, what do I light upon but the following passage (p. xxxii),in the now traditional expositorystyle of "He too had"? He too had been a Champion favored of the Lord, and had matched his great strength against the enemies of his people. He had sent the firebrands of his pamphlets among their corn, and slain their strongest with simple weapons near at hand. He too had taken a wife from among the worshippers of Dagon; he had made a festival with her people over the nuptials which brought him a loss as tragic as Samson's,-the loss of human tenderness, a lowered ideal, and a warped understanding of the deepest human relationships, etc. 708</page><page sequence="11">Elmer Edgar Stoll There, in the last sentence, if not before, crops up the capital error of such interpretation, at which we just now hinted, the failure to take the poet's own point of view, the failure of criticism itself, indeed, to be dramatic. In Raleigh it appears frankly as a principle-and in connec- tion with this apostrophe to the elves." The thought which occurs at once to almost every reader of the play, that Pros- pero resembles Shakespeare himself, can hardly have been absent from the mind of the author. By his most potent art he had bedimmed, etc.l2 If it occurs to us, why, then, how much the more to him! But that logic is too simple, and is prompted by idolatry, which generally results in the distortion and degradation of its object. There are thoughts which others may entertain about the greatest but the greatest cannot have shared. Mr. Moody, to be sure, would not insist on each detail of his comment but only on "some such autobiographic second intention"; yet to me it seems about as likely that the never-humbled Milton, even fur- tively and to himself alone, acknowledged this "loss of human tender- ness," this "lowered ideal," as that Shakespeare thus coolly and openly avowed himself a wonder-worker. But all, perhaps, that Sir Walter meant, was that Shakespeare thought of it, did not expect others to do so. One critic actually suggests that it was only the subtler few (but Jonson would have been among them!) who would have nodded and understood. To the first suggestion there is little to reply. Art is expression; and where there is no expression, criti- cism has no warrant to speak. Who, indeed, can limit the author's thought-but who, unaided, can thus reveal it? And if he has not in any way expressed it, how can it concern us? But in the second suggestion, which implies expression, however elusive, there lies the old fallacy of a double-an esoteric and an exoteric-meaning, which troubles today not only the criticism of Shakespeare but of much other literature of a time gone by. It is like the interpretation of Shylock and Falstaff, of George Dandin and of Don Quixote, which I have touched upon else- where.l3 There are, to be sure, nuances to the characterization-witness our own interpretation of Ariel above!--that the author may not have expected the ordinary audience to notice or appreciate; but that is a different thing from a double, self-contradictory conception, one half for the gross-minded or hard-hearted public of his day, the other for en- lightened posterity. What the coarser intelligence could not perceive must have been fairly in harmony, not at variance, with what it did perceive, u See above, p. 707. 12 Shakespeare (New York, 1907), p. 225. 13 Shakespeare Studies, pp. 331 et seq. 709</page><page sequence="12">"The Tempest" or the work of art is incomprehensible.14 The child's delight in the story of Crusoe, or Gulliver, or Alice in Wonderland is shared by the adult, who but enjoys it more. Even with Goethe the case is much the same as with Milton. Goethe is Faust or Werther in that he himself had at this point or the other passed through somewhat the same experiences, cherished the same sentiments, or arrived at the same conclusions; but there is no secondary personal meaning to the story, no abstract allegory in the other characters. "Noth- ing is more characteristic of Goethe's poetic genius from youth to age," says Calvin Thomas, "than his objectivity." (And more objective is Shakespeare, as all the world knows!) "His starting-point is always the mental image."'l And so it was with Shakespeare, as we have seen in the cases of Ariel and Caliban. Goethe himself said to Eckermann: Speaking broadly, it was never my way as poet to attempt the embodiment of any abstraction. I received impressions . .. such as an active imagination of- fered; and I had nothing further to do as poet than to round out and perfect such visions and impressions inwardly and portray them vividly.'6 And Shakespeare, if he had been self-centered and self-analytic enough, might have said the same. And yet Goethe, with much more reason, but still too little, has been made in the Second Part of Faust to undergo much the same sort of criticism as Shakespeare in The Tempest: It was made didactic through and through ... And since there are many scenes and characters which, in a natural reading of the text, show little trace of any didactic purpose, there was no recourse but to ascribe to these an allegorical meaning. The masquerade was an allegory of society, the sham fire at the end denoting "revolution"; Helena was Greek art; Euphorion, the logical offspring of classicism and romanticism; Mephisto's insects, the whims, crotchets and theories of mechanical scholarship, and so forth. Or if not allegory, the text was veiled biography:17 Prospero, as represented, is the veiled biography; Ariel, Caliban, and Miranda, the allegory; and The Tempest, as from the hands of some of the critics we receive it, is another Zweiter Theil. And for this neither poet is responsible. Personalizing, allegorizing, is simply the besetting sin of criticism: what it has done to Browning, also, both before and after his repeated protest, is evident upon examination of Childe Roland and, under that heading, of the Browning Cyclopaedia.l' To warrant such 4 Cf.

"Speaking broadly," for in figures like Sorge there is allegory of course. 17 Op. cit., p. lxiii. 18 M. de Reul (Rice Institute Pamphlets, xrII, p. 236) is certainly right in denying the presence of any allegory in Browning save possibly in Numpholeptos. 710</page><page sequence="13">Elmer Edgar Stoll interpretation there must be some hint in the text; as indeed there is for allegory in Tennyson's Vision of Sin and Palace of Art, and for sym- bolism in his Ulysses and Merlin and the Gleam. 5 And Shakespeare also made Caliban-after the air the earth, or, as some say, alongside the spirit of poetry that of prose! But Caliban is as poetically conceived and expressed as Ariel, and as far beyond the reach of Shakespeare's experience and Goethe's imagination. He fits perfectly into the dramatic scheme as the creature of earth-both a parallel and a contrast with the spirit of the air-but not at all as the vulgar public. It is a state of nature-Prospero and Miranda as human figures coming in between-and what is drama, or the dramatic public either, doing there? As we have seen, Caliban, like Ariel, the Ghosts, and the Weird Sisters, had, in his own day, the advantage with the audience (by the accepted interpretation now taken from him) of being somewhat familiar, a de- velopment out of a popular superstition. And from the familiar to the unfamiliar is the right dramatic and poetic procedure, particularly in dealing with the supernatural: it was followed by Milton when he peopled his. hell, not with his own inventions, but with heathen divinities, such as Moloch and Mammon-followed by both Milton and Dante, indeed, when undertaking to present hell and heaven in the first place. With the mental image he began, but in his mind it budded and developed; and like many others of his, superstitious or not in origin, it seized and as- similated qualities of characters somewhat different but compatible and akin. Puck, merged with the "familiar spirit," becomes in The Tempest the spirit of the air. And Caliban is not only the offspring of witch and devil, but both a sea monster and a land monster, and also a native Indian or "man in the making," who, quaintly but decently, wears a gaberdine. As Luce (who thinks he is also a negro) has noticed, it is well- nigh impossible to visualize him: one half of his features seem to con- tradict the other half; and he belongs wholly to the poetical art, not the pictorial. But the contradictions in his inner make-up, still greater and more various-his lawlessness and his instinct to worship and obey, his affectionateness and his vindictiveness, his abusiveness and murderous- ness and his craving and ready gratitude for human comfort and pro- tection, his sensuality and his delight in the pleasures of imagination, that is, in dreaming and in listening to stories and music-all these nevertheless belong together, congruous in their incongruity, within the wide and elastic limits of the primitive mind. Unfamiliar, he is conceiv- able enough; for such, once upon a time, by ancestral proxy, were audi- 711</page><page sequence="14">"The Tempest" ence and author both, and, though with a shudder, they delight in the combination now.l9 This is only, so to speak, the structure or anatomy,-in Caliban it is more clearly indicated than in most of Shakespeare's characters-and the miracle of creation is yet to come. He is given a voice, his very own. As with the other great characters of Shakespeare the style (or accent) is the man, and here it is completely differentiated from that of any other in this play or its predecessors. Not that there is realism. What is more difficult, but therefore the finer, the dramatist keeps within the limits of metre and the established idiom: and does not let him take to Brooklyn wharf-rat jargon, like the Hairy Ape; or drop into baby-talk, like Kipling's Thy Servant the Dog; or revert to the third person, like the Caliban of Browning. He curses, and yet like the pirates in Treasure Island is not gross or blasphemous; he is lustful, and yet unlike most of O'Neill's characters, not filthy or obscene. He is not a naked monster, happy in the mire; as Cleopatra is not a naked prostitute, Falstaff not a mere rogue nor Shallow and Silence mere bores, nor Iago a murderous beast. One and all they are clothed-in humor, thought, imagination, verbal music, and whatever else is woven into the magic mantle of poetry. 6 Prospero calls him, and by a felicitous stroke of stage-craft he bawls out before he enters: "There's wood enough within." The speech both sets the comic tone and gives at the outset the clew to his character. For him wood-carrying is his "cross," his tragic lot, as it still is, I fancy, for many a boy on the farm. It is continually on his mind, or so to speak, his conscience, and becomes a measure of his passions-fear or hatred, love or gratitude. Later, in dread of Trinculo and Stephano as spirits sent to punish him, he vows to bring his wood home faster; and when shifting allegiance to the new ruler, or god, who bears the celestial liquor, he not only will kiss his foot but "get thee wood enough." It is at once a comic device-a repeated motif-and a unifying and simplify- ing artifice in the presentation of the character. Six lines are spoken-Ariel, for a contrast,20 meanwhile coming in and going out, and Prospero repeating his summons-before the mooncalf, cursing, lumbers in. All the malign and baleful operations of nature he can think of he now calls down upon the magician and his daughter, receiving threats in return. Scared by these, he thereupon takes to the defensive and to grumbling. 19 In this paragraph and elsewhere are reproduced a few touches from the sketch of Caliban in my Poets and Playwrights (1930), pp, 124, 127. 20 Coleridge (ibid.), iI, p. 177. 712</page><page sequence="15">Elmer Edgar Stoll I must eat my dinner, and it is a speech in the same vein as the first. Nothing irritates a servant like being interrupted at that sweet duty, and Caliban stands on his elementary rights. Others he remembers forthwith: This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou tak'st from me, -even as we now unconvincingly say of our Continent, though not born on it, to all new-comers. Then, by an illogical but delightfully natural transition, and in the same childish vein, he casts up to his master his kindness in the past and his own gratitude for it. When thou cam'st first Thou strok'dst me, and made much of me, would'st give me Water with berries in't, and teach me how To name the bigger light, and how the less That burn by day and night; and then I lov'd thee And show'd thee all the qualities of the isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile. Curs'd be I that did so. And from out of the midst of this appealing whimper, he falls, despite his memories, to cursing Prospero anew. He must have release, as the saying now is; for he has not yet developed "inhibitions." "His spirits hear me," he later confesses, "and yet I needs must curse." For only with time do punishments deter. Never, I suppose, was by thought, word, and rhythm, as well as by mental process, a character so instantly created, and-for I have thus far omitted nothing-so perfectly preserved. Not a false note, anywhere. Caliban is the perfect brute, who would be petted, given food and drink, taught to talk and told stories, yet (with this given as the reason) turns vindictive when he isn't. And what follows is, though startling, as true. When he complains of being "'stied in this hard rock," Prospero reminds him that he had lodged him in his own cell until he sought to violate his daughter. Then comes the one sexual touch that Shakespeare permits himself-imagine, with the opportunity, a Joyce or an O'Neill!- Oho, Oho! would't had been done! Thou didst prevent me: I had peopl'd else This isle with Calibans. No doubt the picture would have been truer with the monster freely wallowing, and art is not morality. It is beauty, however. 7 After the sweet idyllic meeting of Miranda and Ferdinand, and the cynical but rather boresome conspiracy of Antonio and Sebastian, there 713</page><page sequence="16">"The Tempest" comes-according to the delightful Shakespearean principle or practice of "vivid contrast between scene and scene swiftly succeeding each other," one of low life and comic relief-Caliban entering, amid thunder, bowed under the white man's burden, and with curses again pouring from his lips. His second entrance, though similar, is better than the first, and, as repeated motif, would instantly bring a laugh. This time we see the wood, cause of the cursing. And Trinculo the jester now appear- ing, he takes him, with his bad conscience, for a spirit dispatched to punish his sloth; and, like an opossum or an ostrich (though not exactly), and Browning's Caliban seeking to escape Setebos' ire, he falls flat. The scene which ensues is delectable. Trinculo, after due considera- tion of the ambiguous phenomenon (neither flesh nor fish) and of the un- ambiguous weather, arrives at the conclusion that it is an islander struck by a thunderbolt; and there being no other refuge hereabouts, crawls under his gaberdine. Then enters Stephano the butler, half-drunk, yet enriched with the drunken man's "double personality," trolling catches to his own disappointment, as if they were not of his choosing and sing- ing, but, after each one, taking to his bottle for comfort. "Do not tor- ment me, Oh!" cries the mooncalf . . . "Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster." Stephano thinks him a devil, then a monster of the isle,-with four legs!-"who hath got, as I take it, an ague." "Where the devil should he learn our language?" he cries, with a start. But it is a point in common, a tie. "If it be but for that," he will give him relief, such as he is enjoying. Both are having agues, and Caliban also-"you cannot tell who's your friend," quoth Stephano-takes the cure. Trinculo, meanwhile, should know that voice-"but he is drowned, and these are devils."-"Four legs and two voices," ponders Stephano, "a most delicate monster ... If all the wine in my bottle will recover it (a test of charity indeed!) I will help his ague ... I will pour some in thy other mouth." "Stephano!"-"Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!" The tie is a bit too close, and the butler now is one of a second shaking pair. "Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and speak to me; for I am Trinculo,-be not afeard-thy good friend Trinculo." In his fear, he would dissipate the fear that he causes, but is met by the sage and apposite reply: "If thou beest Trinculo, come forth." There are solemn and sacred reminiscences in these tremulous adjurations, and they have effect. "And art thou living, Stephano? 0 Stephano, two Ne- apolitans scap'd!" The stage business we divine. Caliban, meanwhile, all innocence and gratitude-for this water has more than berries in it-looks on, and, with but a single misgiving, ad- mires: These be fine things, an if they be not sprites: 714</page><page sequence="17">Elmer Edgar Stoll That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor. I will kneel to him. The god is unworthily absorbed in Trinculo's story of his escape and his own tale of cask and bottle; but worship never demanded recognition, and the liquor works on within the mooncalf's veins and brains: Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven? Steph. Out o' the moon, I do assure thee. I was the man i' the moon when time was. Cal. I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee. My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush. While his belly warms, his imagination expands; and as with most drink- ers blest with this faculty, all his romantic dreams come true. It is so with Stephano as well; but himself being the dream rather than the dreamer, he would have the monster swear to his own unsettling words, kissing the book-pulling at the bottle-which in such fashion he does as to call forth the self-forgetful admiration of Trinculo. In his present state Caliban is not only generous but suggestible; and he will now kiss, not the butler's book, indeed, but his foot, and show him all his treasures and wonders, nay, work for him, though by nature so little inclined. Kindness conquers all; and I cannot think it true, though a great critic has said it, that he can only be controlled and made serviceable by terror. If that were so he would be far less of an artistic triumph. I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries; I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough. A plague upon the tyrant that I serve! I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wondrous man! These final half-lines-"I will kneel to him," "And I will kiss thy foot," "Thou wondrous man"-are they not each equivalent to a genuflection or prostration? He is a right worshipper, with motives mingled-love with hatred, gratitude with desire-and it is a comic but (as with Shakes- peare often) even well-nigh a pathetic situation as the poetical native worships the drunken white.21 Also he grows confiding and intimate: n1 Professor Schiicking (Character Problems, 1922, p. 254), speaks of Caliban's "disgusting self-abasement and servility." Coleridge says the poet has raised him far above contempt (ibid., II, p. 178); and the artistic principle touched on above (p. 712) here applies. Boot- licking per se is disgusting, but not in a dog, and not in Caliban half-drunk and moved by gratitude and admiration, in a nobly written play. Was im Leben uns verdriesst Man im Bilde gern geniesst- though Aristotle was the first to say it. 715</page><page sequence="18">"The Tempest" I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow; And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts; Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset. I'll bring thee To clust'ring filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?22 Who wouldn't? "Show thee a jay's nest!"-for there is only one, and Caliban's have been the only eyes to see it. Like Ariel, he loves nature, though after a different fashion; indeed, the two mythical beings alone betray any interest in the island. And now, seized by the spirit of rum and rebellion, and bidden23 by the newly chosen king, or Lord of Misrule, to lead the way, while Trinculo bears aloft, like mace or sceptre, the empty bottle-no empty symbol, however, for "we'll fill him by and by!"-the monster sings, howls, and dances his Declaration of Independ- ence, to the tune, not of the Carmagnole, but of the can-can: Farewell, master; farewell, farewell. Ban, Ban, Ca-Caliban Has a new master, get a new man. Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom, hey-day, freedom! In throwing over his old master he has, like all primitive rebels, neces- sarily taken on another. Some critics, intruding not only their esthetics but also their latter-day ethics into the sacred text, declare that the play teaches the "beauty of service": in Caliban's case it is rather the neces- sity of it, as, though differently, in Ariel's and Ferdinand's. "Let him be Caesar," cries the rabble, after Brutus has justified Caesar's death. 8 In the next scene where he appears, the monster's tongue, loose enough when last we saw him, is tied, and his eyes are "almost set in his head."24 And when he comes to himself he is still full of adulation for Stephano, though of hostility against everybody else. He won't serve Trinculo-he's not valiant. And Trinculo calling him a debosh'd fish, he turns to the butler- Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my lord?- and the insult being repeated, he cries, Lo, lo again. Bite him to death, I prithee, 2 These three lines ending with the same vowel are (like the "light" and "night" above (p. 713), in the same caesural position) strange lapses for the greatest, though most careless, of metrists. Cf. above p. 706, for other examples of Shakespeare's irresponsible art. 23 It may be Caliban that is bidden, but Trinculo is carrying it in the next scene. 24 A phrase misapprehended by both a German and a French critic. "Deep-set," they say, like a philosopher's. 716</page><page sequence="19">Elmer Edgar Stoll for when annoyed not only beasts but children bite. How appealing, like a brute! Resentment is gratitude inverted, is, in the primitive mind, its immediate alternative, and he is still the same creature who had listened wide-eyed to Miranda. Again the insult is repeated, by the mimicry of Ariel; and Caliban bethinks him of punishments more suitable to the offence and occasion, wherein he himself can share: Give him blows And take his bottle from him. When that's gone He shall drink naught but brine, for I'll not show him Where the quick freshes are- so I won't! "I'll bear him no more sticks," he said of Prospero above. And he ha-ha's, as we have seen, at Trinculo's beating, hoping by and by to beat him himself, though now too busy, as he plots against the tyrant. At that thought all his earthy brutality and superstition assert them- selves, in appropriate speech. The deed he would have done not too deli- cately, in the style of the Borgias or the Medici: There thou mayst brain him, Having first seiz'd his books, or with a log Batter his skull, or pound him with a stake, Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember First to possess his books, for they are in Latin or gramarye, and it is by the illiterate that writing and print are held most in awe. In return, he will hand over the daughter; for Stephano is master, and he but man, and she will become thy bed, I warrant, And bring thee forth brave brood. The words smack enough, but not too rankly, of the age of stone. Ariel, invisible, now troubles them with his mysterious song and tune, and Stephano cries, "Mercy on us." "Art thou afeard?" asks Caliban, pricking up his ears, for the spell of the bottle has lifted. "No, monster, not I." "Be not afeard"; and then comes the celebrated passage about the isle being full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not, which has, however, sometimes seemed to me to be a little out of char- acter. But an imaginative brute may properly like music as well as strok- ing and stories; and by it Caliban has been made to dream, not as (at our best) we do, but as does every now and then a simple soul next to us at a concert; and then to see the clouds open and show riches ready to drop upon him, that when he waked he cried to dream again. And the like of that still happens in every nursery, high or low. 717</page><page sequence="20">"The Tempest" This child of nature, however, is cutting his eye-teeth, and, to his cost, learning the folly of his choice. His fellow conspirators won't hold their tongues, and are led astray from their purpose by the plunder-the "trash" or "luggage," as Caliban calls it-at the mouth of the cave. What he foresees befalls them. And when at the end he and the rest are by Ariel ignominiously driven in, he has already fathomed their folly and inanity. Setting eyes now on the gentlemen from the ship, and on Prospero in ducal apparel amongst them, he swears, in an outburst of admiration, by the god of his mother again, not by him of the bottle: O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. The strangers are spirits to him as were Columbus and his crew to the Indians, and as a newcomer in town was thought to be possibly a god in disguise by the Homeric Greeks. Rebellion, moreover, is already in full reaction. And Prospero is master again, to the point that the servant takes a delight in his finery, but, by another psychological transition, bethinks him of what is coming next. The transitions of his thoughts, in- deed, the succession of his emotions, are among the happiest touches in the role. He thinks like a savage, without uttering all that a savage thinks. But Prospero sets him to work trimming the cell; and Caliban shows that he has already learned his first lesson in the values and limi- tations of life as he good-humoredly accepts the order, muttering; What a thrice-double ass Was I to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool! Nature is justified of her child: he acquires something of what she could not transmit but has bestowed the capacity of acquiring-the faculty of Common Sense. 9 How can, now, a character so full-bodied and full-blooded, so vivid and various, so beastly and yet appealing, and engaged in so simple and actual a situation, have a part in anything so contradictory to its inter- est and reality as an allegory? Prospero himself might possibly be sur- rendered to the allegorists, and even (though with a pang) Miranda; but not Ariel, and still less Caliban. Man in the making, to be sure, he in a sense is; but that idea does not interfere with our impression of him as an individual. So real and vital is he, indeed, that by the murder motive the comic effect is somewhat disturbed. It is a case, like Shylock's, and Tartuffe's, and that of some characters in Russian novels, where the figure over- 718</page><page sequence="21">Elmer Edgar Stoll steps the comic limits. But that is the difficulty with comedy-it can no more than tragedy be made wholly to square with life. Caliban, however, does not lose our sympathy, as Stephano and Trinculo somewhat do, be- cause we remember that he is a monster, a savage with a moral sense yet undeveloped. The consciousness of his own wickedness, present in all of Shakespeare's villains, and to us somewhat disconcerting, is happily miss- ing here.25 And even the disturbance to the comic effect is somewhat allayed by our remembrance of the conspirators' drunken condition and Prospero's potent art. Did Shakespeare mean anything by Caliban? asks M. Gillet.26 "Je pense que son but, comme celui de tout vrai poete, a ete de donner une f6te a lui-meme, de jouer avec ses reves." And what he says applies to Ariel as well: he was giving his imagination the rein. Indeed, there is, as often with a poet, something in the sport akin to real dreaming: by the process of "condensation" things apparently dissimilar are merged.27 The Centaur is like a dream; and so are Lamia and Lilith, the snake- women. Caliban, offspring of witch and devil, is partly of the earth, partly of the sea, and also in the literal sense a "caveman." Ariel, a tricksy fairy merged with a magician's familiar spirit, becomes the genius, not of Shakespeare, but of the air. Both, like much else, as we have seen, in Shakespearean art, grew up in the poet's mind, out of a simple popu- lar conception, by a process of fusion and assimilation, as if it were a living body, into something new and rich and strange. In the process there was of course a guiding thread of thought, or a germinal idea-the spirit of the air in the one case, the spawn of the earth in the other-but that worked darkly and under cover. Guided by touch and instinct, the poet, when consciously active at all, was intent upon the life and shape of the imagined creature, not on a meaning within it. (Or rather upon both, for this meaning-this germinal idea-is simple and inherent, not arbi- trary and external as in the accepted interpretation-as if in algebra- and the creature and its meaning are one.) And we should be intent on the same. As M. Gillet remarks after considering some of the most recent interpretations: Mr. Robert Graves', whereby Sycorax becomes the Dark Lady, now exiled, Ariel Shakespeare's passion for her, and Caliban the friend who betrayed him; and Miss Winstanley's, whereby Sycorax becomes Catherine de Medicis, Miranda the Huguenot sect, Ariel the Martyr King, and Caliban (as a matter of course) either Ravaillac or the Jesuit Father Mariana-as he appositely remarks thereupon, I say, 26 Cf. Shakespeare Studies, chap. iii, section 4; and chap. vII.-Coleridge and Schiicking have noted the difference in Caliban. 26 Shakespeare (1931), p. 333. 27 Cf. Professor Prescott's "The Poetic Mind." 719</page><page sequence="22">"The Tempest" nothing is to be gained by translating a metaphor. Mistranslating I would call it-and what happens then? Too well we know: of it the history of criticism is in large part the sorry record. And most of that we could have been spared if the critics had observed their primary, self-evident duty of regarding the author's meaning, of reading the text. On principle, generally, they do observe it (though there are some, of late, like Mr. G. W. Knight, who on principle do not, and with the natural, lamentable consequences); but they gen- erally have some formula of self-deception or the subconscious, allegory or symbolism, whereby, in the end, they thrust their own meaning upon him. Or else they labor under the conviction that poetry is only biog- raphy or history scrambled together, finding references to the Rizzio and the Darnley murders, the Gun-Powder Plot and St. Bartholomew's Eve -for the case all four are needed!-in each of the tragedies Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear! And up from the maw of such dragons of error come those reams and bales of print whereupon we are expected to spend the rapidly diminishing number of our dollars and days! And yet every- body in his senses ought at once to see how it is-that the Fairy Queen is allegorical, and Paradise Lost, save in the story of Satan, Sin and Death, is not; that Tennyson is sometimes allegorical, sometimes sym- bolical, and Browning is neither; that the Master Builder and the Wild Duck, the Princesse Maleine and Pelleas and Melisande, are symbolical, and Pinero and Galsworthy are not; and that Shakespeare has no trace in him of the one quality or the other. Manifestly a writer, whatever else he may be without knowing it, cannot, in that state of mind, be allegorical, or symbolical, or biographical, either, such a matter requiring a little effort or attention. Moreover, how can Prospero be both Shakes- peare and James I, and Hamlet both James and Essex, "in a pamphlet in favor of the Scottish Succession," and the same monarch likewise serve for the Duke in Measure for Measure and for Bottom in the Mid- summer Night's Dream, whether in the pages of the same critic or of several? For if one of these identifications be founded, the others are, since there is no internal evidence or external probability for any. In such a debate the affirmer is in no position to deny. But for us, who deny it all, what is there now left, since words and argument seem to be of no avail, but to fall back upon the desperate remedy of Mr. Max East- man, who is out of this particular conflict, as he considers the similar criticism of our "modernist" poets:- It seems to me that we should be tolerant when poets are too childlike, knowing that to be childlike is an intrinsic part of their creative gift. But for infantilism in critics I do not see that there is a word of defense or apology possible to be spoken.... When they are so little developed, so shut up in their own view- 720</page><page sequence="23">Elmer Edgar Stoll point, that they do not know the diference between receiving a communication and making up a fairy-story, and so little trained in elementary perception of fact that they go right on attributing all sorts of novel and occult attributes to a poet who has himself convincingly explained that his poetry is like all other poetry except that he does not make clear what he is talking about, I do not see what to do with the whole tribe but bundle them into a well-rotted ship and shove them out to sea. (The Literary Mind (1931), p. 121) 10 There is much else to be said of The Tempest-of Miranda, whose love- affair is not exciting, but whose character, though without Perdita's or Imogen's spirit and humor, is not, as some recent critics have de- clared, insipid; of the relations of the father and daughter, which are exquisite; and of the action as a whole, which, owing to the magician's omnipotence, is, for all the good moments, somewhat meagre and dull. By some of the Germans Prospero has been taken psychologically, as having lost the dukedom, not really through a brother's treason but by his own withdrawal from reality, "and as having mended his ways (like one, I suppose, who learns to skate in summer and to swim in winter) on a desert isle. But by Shakespeare his downfall is explained as wholly owing to the machinations of Antonio; and Prospero's failure then and there to employ against him the magic arts which later are so efficacious, is not explained at all. This, like other initial postulates in Shakespeare, and in many another dramatist before and after, must simply be granted: and a psychical defect is no more to be discovered in this deposed duke than in that in As You Like It, or in the disguised one in Measure for Measure, or in the rejected one in Twelfth Night. Like Rosalind's father, moreover, this duke is glad to return to power, though he and his daughter seem much less interested in their unin- habited island than are the other and his followers in the wood of Arden. No one seems to delight in it but Caliban, who was born on it (for Ariel is of the elements, and follows summer like a swallow); and indeed the chief reason that I can see for Milan's being Stratford is that from Nature both Duke and daughter seem glad to get away. So for us too the isle is a disappointment, enchanted, but-and here, again, the difference be- tween Elizabethan fact and present-day figure-not enchanting. Only through the limited sensibilities of Caliban do we know it. It is full of noises, but they are Ariel's sweet airs, not the native woodnotes wild. And that it is wooded we scarcely should know save for Caliban's and Ferdinand's forced labor, Ariel's penitentiary pine, and Stephano's threat to Trinculo of the nearest tree. Shakespeare himself seems un- certain, for in a previous scene Trinculo has crept under the monster's 721</page><page sequence="24">"The Tempest" gaberdine because "here's neither bush nor shrub"; and in the Masque the scenery and vegetation are of field and pasture, not of the wilderness at all. But a virgin forest, on a virgin island, with rocks and flowers and fountains, under strange and unclouded constellations, encircled by trop- ical seas! What would Coleridge, Shelley, or Keats have not made of it, Chateaubriand or Heine! Milton would have given it mystery-if not of novelty, of reminiscence, and of time and space, of light and shade; even Spenser, who, like everybody with a soul, delighted in islands, would have made it into a romantic, though scarcely a wild, primeval spot. Ordinarily, though Shakespeare had less interest than the latter in dis- covery and the New World, he had far more in Nature unsophisticated, the flower, bird and beast, river and sea; and before this he had filled the woods of Athens and Arden with life and charm: I know a bank where the wild thyme blows ... Under the greenwood tree Who loves to lie with me And turn his merry note Unto the sweet bird's throat ... Under the shade of melancholy boughs Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time. Even the poetry of desolation is missing--"there let the wind sweep and the plover cry!"-and Prospero and Miranda leave the island to Caliban, with a farewell only for Ariel and the elves. 11 And that leads to a further consideration, the pervading spirit of the play. Since the chronology was established, criticism has delighted in these last works of the poet's pen, The Tempest, The Winter's Tale, and Cymbeline, not only as a farewell to his art but as a revelation of his personal experience and inmost soul. It has found here, after the dark- ness and despair of the tragedies, a spirit of serenity and reconciliation; and, in the flowers and pastoral landscape, the gallant youths and pure- minded maidens, something of Stratford again. The fundamental premise I will not now again consider;28 confining myself to the remark that optimism, or delight in Nature, either, which depends upon the present experience of the poet, would count for little. It is as likely that the pastoral would have haunted him rather in Lon- don, from afar. But Mr. Lytton Strachey,29 who also rejects the premise, points out clearly that these later plays, including the one now before 28 Cf. Shakespeare Studies, chap. II, "Literature and Life." 29 Books and Characters (London, 1922), the essay "Shakespeare's Final Period." 722</page><page sequence="25">Elmer Edgar Stoll us, are not altogether serene. Dowden and his followers apply to the period of the tragedies the expression "Out of the Depths;" to that of the dramatic romances, "On the Heights." But in this final period there is a measure of ugliness and horror, cynicism and grossness. There are the intended crimes of Iachimo, Cloten, and Cymbeline's Queen, Antonio and Sebastian, and the murderous jealousy of Posthumus and Leontes. And the maidens Imogen and Miranda show a familiarity with unmaid- enly ideas, and the sage Prospero insists upon them, in a way that some- what grates upon us. Why should he warn Ferdinand, about to be left a moment with Miranda, not to break her virgin-knot, and then, the next moment, harp on the subject again? Why, before that, when, mistaking, she asks him whether he is not her father, should be in reply take to the musty old joke of her mother's word; and then, before the scene is over, as, speaking of Antonio's perfidy, he wonders "if this might be a brother," why should the daughter in turn apply it to her grandmother? Here is still another instance of the critics' not reading but reading in; and, as Mr. Strachey says, "this combination of charming heroines and happy endings [and the flowers, we might add, in Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale] has blinded the eyes of modern critics to everything else." Of delight in Nature for her own sake there is in these plays less, it would seem, than in the earlier ones. Prospero himself, as the impersona- tion of Shakespeare, Mr. Strachey finds to be no compliment to the poet-"an unpleasantly crusty personage, with an inordinate propensity for talking"; and, again, "there is no character in the play to whom, dur- ing some part of it, he is not studiously disagreeable." And there is some truth to this, though Prospero's harshness is mainly owing to the poverty of the plot. No obstacles opposing his omnipotence from without, one must be raised up within. Since Miranda, the ingenue, is ready to fall into Ferdinand's arms like a brook into the river, he must stand be- tween them with his menaces and tasks; and since Ariel and Caliban have otherwise little personal interest in the outcome, he must thwart their longings for liberty or idleness. But Mr. Strachey is right enough in say- ing that "it has often been wildly asserted that he is a portrait of the author-an embodiment of that spirit of wise benevolence which is sup- posed to have thrown a halo over Shakespeare's later life." For though the critic goes pretty far in declaring that on closer inspection "both portrait and original are imaginary," Prospero himself, after all allow- ances, is too often dull or sour. The sweet savor, then, of these last plays, and the autumnal glory of them, are not all-pervading, and the poet's own mood is not easily to be ascertained. These dramatic romances, like the contemporary ones of Beaumont and Fletcher, and of Lope and Calder6n, and like the non- 723</page><page sequence="26">"The Tempest" dramatic Greek romances before them, are, in personages and setting, idyllic or fantastic; in time and place, intentionally inaccurate and hazy;30 in incident, exaggerated and improbable; in plot and denoue- ment, arbitrarily contrived. "The Bohemia of The Winter's Tale," says Mr. Mackail, "the Britain of Cymbeline, and the island of The Tempest, fluctuate between earth and a sort of fairyland." The evil in the end does no great harm, and we little believe in it; there is pardon for all misdoers, and that is the necessary ending of such a play. "It is clear," says Mr. Strachey, "that such happy endings, such conventional closes to fantas- tic tales, cannot be taken as evidences of serene tranquillity on the part of their maker." There is, to be sure, a far finer and healthier spirit in Shakespeare's dramatic romances than in Beaumont and Fletcher's; yet it is not easy to say that it is finer and healthier or generally much more exalted than in the comedies or tragedies of his prime. One thing, however, seems fairly clear. A tendency to reverie has grown upon the poet, and with that, a change in the character of his imagery. The plastic anthropomorphic imagery of his hey-day-How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank-gives place a little to some- thing less vital, less solid and clearcut. "The outlines tend to become vast, vague, and wavering, as in a dream-as they will to one whose eyes are resting on the horizon, and whose thoughts brood upon the beginning and the end, over 'the dark backward and abysm of time.' And whereas nature then took on the semblance of man, man's life or work, in its changes, now takes on the semblance of cloud, wind, or water, most fleet- ing and mutable of things."31 Even before the dramatic romances there is an example in the talk of Antony and Eros as the triumvir faces suicide -"Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish . . ." And there is, of course, another-Prospero's speech about the cloud-capped towers- which also it is idle to quote. Perhaps this latter passage, together with the sheep-shearing festival in The Winter's Tale, and the dirge in Cym- beline, has done as much as the charming maidens and the happy endings to make us think of Shakespeare as now exalted and serene. All we can say, however, is that this spirit, together with a meditative and dreamy vein, is prominent. We cannot infer much concerning the poet in him- 30 With the well-known anachronisms and geographical incongruities in Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest compare Calder6n and Lope, Ticknor's Spanish Literature II, p. 375.-In keeping with these, monstrous situations, such as Leontes' commands to throw Perdita and Paulina into the flames, Antigonus' being eaten by a bear, and Cym- beline's recklessness with human life in the denouement, are not only not realized and taken to heart, but also the shock of these is often broken by positive comedy. Generally this is not quite happy in effect; but it is in the first scene of The Tempest. The shipwreck is kept from unduly alarming us, and yet the humor is not at the expense of kindliness. 31 Shakespeare Studies, pp. 22-25. 724</page><page sequence="27">Elmer Edgar Stoll self. Mr. Strachey, judging from the inequality and uncertainty in the workmanship, the fitfulness of the inspiration, thinks that in these last plays Shakespeare was "half enchanted by visions of beauty and love- liness and half bored to death." 12 It is particularly the cloud-capped towers speech, I suspect, that causes critics like Mr. Bailey and Professor Mackail (who have else- where resisted the insidious biographical fallacy), to accept Prospero as Shakespeare.32 And certainly here the supposition nowise entails a charge of vaingloriousness as it does in connection with the address to the elves. In this speech, then, is Shakespeare-ergo, Prospero is Shakespeare him- self! But why, in the first instance? Because the speech comes directly from out of his heart of hearts? Like the apostrophe to the elves, it is deeply and directly indebted to another poet, the one to a passage in Lord Sterling's Darius (c. 1603), as the other to Ovid. The fact is, in life we would have things come in pat and neatly, as in a play-though in a play, according to our esthetic principles, as in life. We know not that The Tempest is Shakespeare's last unaided work-indeed, more than likely one so unselfconscious and so dependent upon circumstances would not have known it was to be such as he wrote it-but we think such it must be because there are two farewells in it, one to an art, and another, in a sense, to the world; and since it is his last work, the farewells must be Shakespeare's own! We would have him, too, making his exit, in the traditional style, with gesture and "parting glance." The farewells are his because he wrote them. And the speech about the cloud-capped towers is his in a deeper sense than that to the elves be- cause his imagination as he wrote it was more afire; and also because what he says there fits the situation not only of Prospero at the end of his pageant but that of many another serious soul when for the last time the curtain falls, or a leaf is turned. But in this deeper sense all the great speeches, and all the great characters, are Shakespeare's, and especially the nobler ones. Yet this does not mean that through the mask he him- self is speaking, or puts his own person on the stage. He is a dramatist, and is the greatest of dramatists chiefly for the very reason that, amid the multitude and plenitude of his characters, he does this less than any other. Goethe, in a sense, is Faust, and, particularly in the next to the last great speech- 32 See above, p. 703 note. Professor Mackail, chap. II, even seems to share my opinion that Shakespeare, like the world about him, was not aware of his own greatness; himself perhaps not aware that by the reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement (Sept. 1, 1927) the conception had been already pronounced impossible. 725</page><page sequence="28">"The Tempest" Ich bin nur durch the Welt gerannt,- he tells the story, pronounces the justification, and imparts the philoso- phy, of his life. With a lofty and not unseemly self-consciousness the sage of Weimar bids the world adieu. And it is not unnatural that people should be sorry for those who do not believe Prospero to be Shakespeare. Most of us read biography rather than poetry; and if poetry, to find the poet. But upon reflection should we not rather be sorry for those who do not see how much more it is in keeping, not only with the man as we know him but with the poetry which is highest, that Shakespeare, per- haps penning his last drama, should write as no one has ever written of the end, not only of man's work but of Nature's, and of life as a dream, and death as a sleep, and yet be thinking not much more than of any other mortal of himself? Self-forgetfulness is a virtue of the mind-the imagination-as well as the heart. It raises the greatness and beauty of the drama above that of the lyric. And the supreme poet, I suppose, such as Homer and Shakespeare, rather than Goethe, Milton, or Byron, is a seer and creator, not a sage, or prophet, or actor, with eyes now and again rolling inward-upward-sidelong. He is an "extravert," and in the world of visions. He is "a poet hidden in the light of thought." ELMER EDGAR STOLL University of Minnesota 726</page></plain_text>
