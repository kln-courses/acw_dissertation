<plain_text><page sequence="1">Films Towards the end of Tales of Beatrix Potter (ABC) there's a strong feeling of anthropomorphic overkill. Ninety minutes of chocoiatey enchantment is a bit much when the chocoiate has no hard centre. The basic idea of interpreting the animai characters through baiiet is a good one. But it is maimed by lack of imagination. The pace and inventiveness of the i best scene, where two mice, hounded by a cat, iet off steam in a doii's house, are particularly noticeable because of their general absence. Filming baiiet is as precarious a business as producing a screenplay from Shakespeare. The absence of the cruciai live element of the theatre must be disguised and this is where "Beatrix Potter" faiis as a fnm. There is a conspicuous proscenium archness about it an. Much of the time the camera is pionked down and the dancers of the Royal Baiiet perform in front of it. In the outdoor dances especially it ought to be actively in the middle of things, not loitering on the sidelines. The usual sequence is for the camera to pan back from an initial close-up on the characters, remain static during most of the dance, then zoom in again on the characters. This technique is so grossly overused that it becomes annoyingly obtrusive. Also obtrusive are a couple of eariy appearances by a youthful Beatrix Potter,</page><page sequence="2">FORTNIGHT 29 dreaming her Victorian childhood away. The ballet form is rigidly adhered to, which means total exclusion ofthe spoken word. This deprives us of appealing animal names like Mrs. Tiggy-Winkie, Tabitha Twitchit and so on. It also means frequent resort to papers, signposts and suchlike as explanatory devices. Some of Beatrix Potter's original narrative would have helped link some of the sequences. The set-like sets add to. the fairy taie atmosphere and most of the dances ? particularly the one in which Jemima Puddle Duck tries to lay an egg ? are very well done. The animal masks are magnificent. ^;pity, then, that the director, Reginald Mills, is so reluctant to linger on them in close-up. The accompanying Buster Keaton short, 'The Paleface," shows up the 1971 film for its comparative dearth of visual inventiveness. But it is the lack of opportunity for involvement and indentifi cation in the "Beatrix Potter" film that may limit its long-term appeal as a box office draw for the school holidays -*- a mistake Disney would never make. Baioo the Bear can feel safe. _ . _ .. Brian Bell.</page></plain_text>
