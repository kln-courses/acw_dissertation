<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ON BEYOND GENDER: REPRESENTATION OF  GOD IN THE TORAH AND IN THREE RECENT  RENDITIONS INTO ENGLISH David E.S. Stein Three recently published English translations of the Torah refer to God in  unusual ways: They offer the reader the rare experience of encountering  the biblical God as a persona who is “beyond” gender. The three rendit tions, which  are  of  related  provenance  and  presented  as  “gender  accut rate” or “gender sensitive,” appear in The Torah: A Modern Commentary,  revised edition (2005); The Contemporary Torah (2006); and The Torah:  A Women’s Commentary (2008). Having served as the central member on  the translation teams that addressed gender issues, I review considerations  for  construing God’s  gender  as  represented  in  the Torah. The  analysis,  based on a reconstruction of ancient plaintsense reading conventions and  concepts about deity, explains why a (mostly) gendertneutral translation  produces the least distortion of the Torah’s Godtlanguage. The article then  characterizes the three new renditions and their Godtlanguage, including  the representation of God’s name and the rendering of ascriptive imagery. Judaism recognizes a God who transcends all of humankind’s  thought catt egories, including the societal constructs of “woman” and “man.” Yet such a  God has not always been easy to locate within the Bible’s English translations,  where the Deity usually comes across as a male being. Recently, however, two  venerable Jewish publishers have cooperated to produce three books that now  afford readers the opportunity of encountering the biblical God as a persona  who is “beyond” human gender classification. The publishers characterize these new translations as “gender accurate” or  “gender sensitive” because of how they treat language related to the Torah’s  human  characters.  I was  the  central member  on  the  translation  teams  that  addressed gender  issues.1 Our overall  task was  to  focus on  the  text’s plain  108  NASHIM: A Journal of Jewish Women’s Studies and Gender Issues. © 2008 </page> <page sequence="2"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions sense—what  it  conveys when  read  according  to  normal  rules  of  grammar,  in light of context. In general, we sought, as Phyllis Bird has aptly put it, “to  enable a modern audience to overhear an ancient conversation, rather than to  hear itself addressed directly.”2 Yet for language referring to God, we made an exception: we preferred nont gendered terms by default. We did so because the translations are intended  primarily  for  devotional  use  in  study  and  liturgy. A  contemporary  Jewish  devotional audience relates to a nontgendered God;3 we have given that audit ence an opportunity to encounter its God more directly, without having to keep  hurdling over “He”s and “the Lord”s. By rendering in gendered English only  where gender is germane in the Hebrew (which is almost never the case), we  have created a contemporary Targum.4 The publishers made that principal translation choice explicitly, as a matter  of contemporary ideology. Yet I myself have since concluded that in an othert wise gendertaccurate or gendertsensitive rendition, the use of (mostly) gendert neutral Godtlanguage also conveys  the sense of  the “ancient conversation”  with less distortion than does rendering in terms of “hethisthimthimself.” Because my view at first glance contradicts that of most academic scholars  of  the Bible, I devote most of  this article  to making the case for  it.5 Part 1  addresses the translation distortion (or accuracy) issue, but only after investit gating what the Torah text meant in Hebrew. That is, I first reconstruct ancient  reading conventions and concepts about deity, which I then use to assess how  the Torah represented God to its original audience.6 Only with such knowledge  can one determine the accuracy of an English translation. Part 2 describes the  three recently published renditions and characterizes them in terms of their  distinctive treatments of Godtlanguage. In short, this article takes us on a visit to the ancient Near East—with gramt mar, linguistics, religious history and literary criticism as our travel compant ions. Our journey ends in the contemporary USA with concrete comparisons  of three books. 1. GODtLANGUAGE AND HISTORICAL ACCURACY IN TRANSLATION We cannot reach a firm conclusion about gender in ancient Israelite percept tions of  the Torah’s deity,  for  two reasons. First,  religious beliefs regularly  involve paradox, which means we cannot rule out that the Israelites may have  109 </page> <page sequence="3"> David E.S. Stein construed the Torah’s God as both male and at the same time beyond all human  categories.7 More importantly, nowhere does the Torah state outright that its deity is or  is not male.8 Even the Bible’s famous and repeated censure of iconic images  (e.g., Deut. 4:15–16) means only that the Deity should not be visually repr resented in (gendered) bodily form. It does not necessarily claim that God’s  “person” possesses no bodily form. Indeed, a number of biblical statements  imply that the Deity does have a visible form; conversely, some neighboring  peoples—who surely  imagined  their deities with bodies—avoided  icons  in  their worship  settings,  too.9 Thus,  no one  today  can  conclusively prove or  disprove that the Torah presents a God that is beyond gender. Any attempt to  confirm or deny a meaningful absence of something (in this case, an implied  gender ascription) is ultimately an argument from silence. Instead of striving for conclusive proof, I will aim to demonstrate the plaur sibility of the following claim: The composer(s) of the complete Torah had  good reason to believe that the ancient audience would construe its deity as  a God beyond gender. For linguistic reasons that I shall explain later, estabt lishing  plausibility  is  sufficient  grounds  to  conclude  that  in  an  otherwise  gendertsensitive translation, a (mostly) gendertneutral English rendering of the  Godtlanguage is more accurate than the customary masculine pronouns. By  reconstructing  ancient  reading conventions  and concepts  about deity,  I will  come  to  the  following  interim  conclusions:  (1) Neither  the Torah’s  grammatically “masculine” expressions nor its ascription of “male” imagery  required construing God as an inherently male being. (2) Nontgendered cont ceptions of deity were familiar to the ancient audience. (3) The Torah’s initial  and most telling characterization of its deity precludes a gendered reading of  God’s nature throughout the work. Hebrew Eye for the NonrGendered Guy The Torah text consistently refers to God via wording that grammarians call  “masculine” (as opposed to the “feminine” alternative). Typically, when biblit cal Hebrew refers to a specific being via masculine pronouns, verbal inflect tions and adjectival forms, this indicates that the speaker ascribes male social  gender to the referent.10 But that is not necessarily so, because the situation is  not binary. Sometimes a referent’s social gender is unknown, ambiguous or  110  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="4"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions indeterminate. Several lines of mutually reinforcing evidence show that in such  cases, ancient Israelites would likely have employed masculine language:11 (1) Genesis 38:28–29 employs masculine inflections and pronouns to refer  to a subject whose biological sex is not yet known, namely, the possessor  of the tiny hand that briefly emerges from Tamar’s birth canal. (2) Rabbinic Hebrew employs masculine language matter-of-factly to  denote a specific person who possesses both male and female sex charact- teristics (a hermaphrodite). It is also used for a specific person of indetert- minate sex.12 (3) In biblical Hebrew, masculine language is used for nonspecific gender- inclusive references, suggesting an analogy for specific references where  the subject’s gender identity is not otherwise indicated. In sum, the use of masculine Hebrew wording does not necessarily mean that a  particular referent was believed to be male. The Torah’s use of masculine Godt language means only that God was not thought of as a solely female being.  Masculine wording provides no proof that the Torah’s composer(s) considered  God to be a male deity, nor that its original audience would have construed  maleness to be its authorial intent. Gendering the Vehicle without Gendering Its Passenger The Torah applies to God imagery drawn from the human realm. Most often  the social gender of that imagery is masculine: lord, father, king, householder,  redeemer and warrior.13 However, in the eyes of the ancient audience, such  imagery would have said nothing about whether the Torah was presenting a  male deity per se. The scholarly literature evinces a fair amount of imprecision and inconsist tency regarding how imagery worked when applied to deities. To elucidate this  topic, I will construct a framework from several disciplines of linguistics. The conceptual domain of “deity” is a product of religious consciousness,  within which reality is seen to operate by different rules than reality as pert ceived within mundane consciousness. Thus, ordinary  language expression  does not suffice.14 The ancients commonly spoke about the domain of deity  by describing a deity as a person. Personification of a deity was a matter of  111 </page> <page sequence="5"> David E.S. Stein idiom; it was part of normal, mattertoftfact discourse in ancient Near Eastern  culture.15 In cognitive terms, personification was an act of mapping between the cont ceptual domain of “humankind” and the conceptual domain of “deity.” Upon  encountering a personification, the audience would at once have recognized  a factual incongruity:16 Deities are not people; the two types of being do not  share all of the same characteristics.17 Therefore, whenever a text referred to  deities via “people ideas” that were not automatically characteristic of deities,  the audience would have known that it was referring only to some aspect of a  deity that is like what is expected of people.18 Personification of a deity is not a statement of mathematical identity (“God =  King”). Nor is it a claim of existential facts about that deity. Rather, it is an “as  if” statement. It attributes certain qualities to the deity. It refers to situational  similarity in structure or function between that deity and a typical person. It  is a form of ascription; and it is valid only as far as the analogy extends in  that context. Personification was  employed  as  a  vehicle  to  convey  a  statement  about  deity—and especially about one’s relationship with deity. For example, three  Torah passages—Ex. 4:22, and Deut. 1:31 and 8:5—pair God together with  Israel (the nation), likening them to the duo of a fatherthouseholder and his  firstborn son.19 In those contexts, such imagery would have evoked a situation  natural and familiar to the Israelite audience, whose members lived and worked  in patrimonially organized corporate households. It momentarily ascribed to  God both a structural role as the authority who determined heirship, as well  as functional roles of preserving the household legacy (including patrimony),  and of investing whatever attention was needed to raise a worthy heir.20 Upon  encountering  such  an  ascription,  the Torah’s  audience would have  sorted through the possibilities in order to ascertain the nature of the intended  comparison.  So what was  the  ancients’  interpretive  strategy  (that  is,  their  conventions  of  reading)  for  handling  the  socialrgender component  of  a  personification? Empirical evidence shows that they distinguished the gender of the vehicle  from that of the tenor. Even when the subject of an ascription was a human  being,  the ancients did not restrict  themselves  to a onettotone socialtgender  correspondence. Thus, kinship terms were regularly used ascriptively without  gender being at issue. For example, in Phoenician royal inscriptions, one regent  boasts that “to one person I was a father, to another I was a mother”; another  112  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="6"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions observes gratefully that “Ba‘l made me a father and a mother to the Danunites.”21  The Book of Deuteronomy (15:12) explicitly refers to a female Israelite slave  as a “brother.” A prophecy proclaiming a bright future for the people of Israel  poetically assigns a female biological function to male rulers: “You shall nurse  nations’ milk / kings’ breasts you shall suck” (Isaiah 60:16).22 The authors of  all four texts pointedly chose gendered imagery because of special meaning that  it conveyed, yet they also expected their audience not to identify the gender of  the referents with the gender of the images applied to them. The same goes for the ancients’ application of ascriptive language in the case  of a deity. Certain proper names evinced a willingness (by the bearers’ parents)  to attribute a female role to a male deity; for example, in the northern Syrian  city  of Ugarit,  an  extant  text mentions  a  fellow  called  “AthtartIstMother,”  invoking the (male) god Athtar. Similarly, various ancient Near Eastern prayers  address a male deity as “mother and father”; other prayers address a female  deity in those terms.23 Such usages imply that where the Torah ascribes male imagery to God, the  audience (a) was not supposed automatically to construe that deity as necessart ily male; and (b) would have known not to do so as a matter of course. Rather,  the audience would have scanned for evidence that gender is germane, asking  themselves: Is the masculinity in opposition to, or in negation of, femininity?  If so, the imagery might be what Erhard Gerstenberger calls an “attempt to  polemicize against female realities.”24 If not, the audience would assume that  the text was making some other point. In all cases where the Torah refers to  God as a warrior, lord, king and so forth, they would have seen no indication  from the context that gender is at issue.25 (Moreover, many of those images  occur  in  poetry, where  the  genre  reinforces  the  expectation  that  its  vivid  imagery is not to be taken literally.) Consequently, in terms of ancient Israelt ite mores and the plain sense of the passages in question, such imagery says  nothing whatsoever about God’s social gender.26 Conceiving of a NonrGendered Deity: No Problem Historians of religion have shown that in the Levant, prior to the genesis of the  Israelite people, the high god was depicted as the male head of a household  (or of a governing council) of deities. The Torah effectively equates this high  god, who was named El, with its deity named Yrhrwrh.27 Historians therefore  113 </page> <page sequence="7"> David E.S. Stein postulate that Yrhrwrh merged with (or displaced) the existing high god in the  minds of the Israelites.28 That historical reconstruction, if correct, does not mean that the Torah’s deity  was necessarily understood as male. As I have shown, the Israelites probably  did not confuse the Torah’s Godtimagery (fatherhood, kingship, etc.) with the  deity that it referred to. Yet this issue affords us a good opportunity to explore  the ancient audience’s readiness to entertain the thought of a nontgendered  deity.  I will now argue on several grounds  that  in  the ancient Near East  in  Israel’s heyday, as well as in Israel itself, deities were often imaged without an  articulated personality, and thus social gender was not an ineluctable property  of any deity. The Customary Conception of Deities What conception of deities was taken for granted when the Torah was first  promulgated? As stated earlier, the denizens of the ancient Near East comt monly spoke of each major deity as a person with human attributes—a body,  emotions, needs and so forth—who engaged in activities as a human being  does; for example, by interacting with others. And as a matter of course, people  attributed a social gender to each such personified deity. However,  the ancients did not constrain  their view of deities  to personal  imagery. Edward Greenstein has rightly noted  that  in ancient Near Eastern  literature, “gods are depicted differently depending upon the purposes of the  representation.”29 Regularly, too, the ancients depicted their major deities in  nonpersonal terms. Typically, they ascribed to each deity a totem animal, a  semiprecious stone, a mineral, a celestial body, a particular force or power, a  symbolic number and so forth. Particularly when marshaled in combination,  these things represented or manifested a given deity. Modern scholars of the ancient Near East have tended to view an anthropot morphic image of a deity as its primary identity, seeing the other identifiers  as mere “symbols” or “abbreviations.” However, another (simpler and more  historically plausible) view is that the ancients employed human imagery as  one among many alternate ways of evoking an underlying deity’s functions  and presence.30 To explain the ancient Egyptians’ representation of their deities  simultaneously  in human, animal and hybrid forms, Egyptologist Siegfried  Morenz noted in 1960 that “ ‘power’ as primary cause . . . can elevate to the  rank of deity [both] man and animal, even plant and object, so that neither . . .  ceases to be God in potentia.”31 As for Mesopotamia, Assyriologist Barbara  114  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="8"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions Porter  holds  that  a  deity was  “a  set  of  related  but  not  completely  congrut ent phenomena and qualities, only one of which was  imagined as a divine  person.”32 This  conception  is  consistent with  patterns  of  representation  for  deities specifically in the Levant, including the Land of Israel.33 In resorting to a wide variety of expressions, the ancients once again seem  to have differentiated between an underlying religious phenomenon or expet rience and the imagery (literary or otherwise) that they used to denote it. In  other words, the ancients readily imagined and experienced their deities apart  from personhood—and thus apart from social gender. The  point  bears  emphasis.  Scholars  have  assumed  that  throughout  the  ancient Near East, before and during Israel’s life as a nation, personhood was  viewed as a quintessential, irreducible element of a deity’s nature. Arguably,  however, attributing personhood (and its attendant social gender) was just one  alternative for conveying what a given deity represented.34 The Impact of International Perspective Linguistic considerations, it appears, further helped some of the ancients to  view deity regularly through a nontgendered lens. In contrast with Hebrew  and other Semitic tongues, a few Near Eastern languages did not differentiate  personal nouns by grammatical gender; the mythic poetry, epics and inscript tions written in those languages speak about male and female deities without  linguistic gender distinction.35 During the last two millennia bce, male elites  among native speakers of Semitic tongues often learned a nontgendered lant guage (Sumerian, Hittite or Luwian), because it enjoyed international scope  and literary standing.36 Given the ancients’ concept of the inherent reality of  words, this multilingualism had cognitive consequences: The reader became  used to viewing deities without grammatical gender cues; and in this view their  social gender would not have been part of their nature, for, as Assyriologist and  translator Stephanie Dalley has pointed out, “the change in noun categories  would mirror a change in the objects which these nouns represented.”37 It seems likely that for several centuries, at least a few Israelites—namely,  the literate elite most likely to have been involved in producing the Bible— were familiar with the (grammatically nontgendered) Hittite language. Cert tain cultic regulations in the Torah are strikingly similar (in both detail and  literary expression) to Hittite texts unearthed in modern times.38 Furthermore,  the Bible  alludes  to  diplomatic  relations  between  the  Israelite  and Hittite  governments.39 115 </page> <page sequence="9"> David E.S. Stein Biblical Presumptions The Bible’s own literary style is further evidence that the Israelites shared a  larger Near Eastern conception of deity as not being inherently gendered. I  am referring to what has been called “the divine symphony”40 of voices in the  Hebrew Bible: It presents various conceptions of Israel’s God, some of which  depict  a  personhood  so pale  as  arguably  to  be  devoid of  personality—and  therefore of social gender. Although on the whole the God of Israel,  in the  words of Yochanan Muffs,  is “probably  the most articulated personality of  all Near Eastern deities,”41 only some of the Bible’s specific representations  are actually so colorful. Stephen A. Geller characterizes biblical theology in  terms of three dominant traditions, and he succinctly summarizes their views  of God: “In each one of them, one aspect of the deity predominates. The God  of the covenant tradition is a personality; of the priestly tradition, a force; and  of the wisdom tradition, a principle.”42 That such distinctive characterizations  of the same deity often appear side by side in the same biblical book is prima  facie evidence that its composer(s) expected the audience not to be fazed by  such dramatically different views of deity. This consideration of the ancient Near Eastern conceptual context—linguist tic, iconographic and theological—and the biblical evidence leads me to two  conclusions. First, the composer(s) of the Torah plausibly imagined its deity  as something other than a personal being with a particular gender (at least  in certain genres). Second, the composer(s) of the Torah plausibly had good  reason to presume that the text’s Israelite audience was prepared to construe in  nonrgendered terms the Torah’s insistence on one transcendent Deity (again,  at least in some literary settings). Marketing an “AllrNew” Model of Yrhrwrh Historians of Israelite religion point to (disputed) epigraphic and iconographic  evidence that, during the Israelite monarchy and well into the exile, some Israt elites thought of their national deity Yrhrwrh as having a female consort.43 If so,  then some among the Torah’s audience perhaps worshipped that presumably  male Yrhrwrh. What would prevent them from reading such maleness into the  deity of the same name whom the Torah champions? It  seems  that  the  Israelites  knew of  different  versions  of Yrhrwrh  and of  ’elohim (“God”).44 Given the apparent variety of ancient conceptions of the  116  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="10"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions deity known by those names, it would have been no surprise to the audience  if the Torah was promulgating an idiosyncratic view. The real question, then,  is twofold: Does the Torah present its deity as beyond gender? And would this  feature have been clear to an ancient audience that took the text on its own  terms? (The answer does not depend on how the audience members themselves  viewed Yrhrwrh.) So let me now review the Torah’s presentation of its deity,  assessing the plausibility that the target audience of the composer(s) would  construe that deity as beyond gender, and would see this as a distinguishing  feature of that deity. Of the Bible’s many depictions of God, the one that counts most is the first  one. As Yair Hoffman has put it, the start of the Torah is a “strategic location.”  Depictions placed there have extra weight.45 A first impression lingers: As a  matter of ordinary reading strategy, later representations must be read as comt patible with the initial one. When the Bible continues to speak about one God  as a single character, the audience is expected to construe the representations  of this character as coherent and consistent.46 What might  be  termed  the Torah’s  “real”  story—that  of  the  relationship  between God and humankind—does not begin until Gen. 1:26.47 The initial  twentytfive verses (extending partway into the sixth day of Creation) are a kind  of prologue. Nevertheless, this prologue is crucial for the audience to establish  the character of its protagonist, ’elohim (“the deity in question”; usually rent dered in English as “God”).48 The question is whether in that passage ’elohim  is rendered as a dramatis persona—a personage who plays a role—who would  be expected to possess gender. Space constraints require me not only to assume  that the present reader is familiar with this famous section, but also to give my  answer while standing on one foot.49 As depicted in Gen. 1:1–25, ’elohim is indeed a persona, albeit minimally  so.50 Relatively weak personification downplays any distinctive socialtgender  connotations of the predicates—connotations that (in terms of Israelite mores)  are lacking anyway. There is nothing peculiarly male here. Masculinity versus  femininity is not at issue. More  importantly,  this  deity  is  almost  nothing  like  a  human  being. The  incongruities of the personification appear on many levels, starting with the  vocabulary. The verbs brrr’ (“created,” 1:1, 21) and brrrk (“blessed,” 1:22) set  the subject apart from humans.51 Strikingly,  this  persona  accomplishes what  no  literal  person  could begin  to do: organizing  the cosmos merely by expressing one’s wishes (not even  117 </page> <page sequence="11"> David E.S. Stein  commands!),  and without  the  involvement  of,  or  divine  interaction with,  anyone else. That is not how human speech works. Dale Patrick points to the  resulting paradox: “Here is a persona who possesses an identity like other (i.e.,  human) personae, but [it is part of this deity’s persona to] surpass all traits of  human personae.”52 Even more strikingly, this persona accomplishes what no deity could begin  to do. The key  incongruity  is not simply a matter of one god versus many  gods, but rather the extent of control. As Yochanan Muffs explains, everyone  in the audience knows that deities “do not have full control over their fates.  . . . They are subject to internal, physical needs but also to external, magical  forces” (quite apart from a given deity’s need to reckon with other deities and  their portfolios).53 Clearly, no such constraints apply here; this ’elohim is not  “within the system” as other ancient Near Eastern deities (including Yrhrwrh)  have been heretofore, but rather operates from “outside the system.”54 Thus, the  appellative ’elohim is given new meaning as the passage generates a secondt order figurative ascription. It seems to say, “This is not how you have known  ’elohim before.” Or more colloquially: “It’s not your parents’ Yrhrwrh!”55 Glaring  linguistic  incongruity  (with  both  the  idiom  of  personhood  and  the  conceptual  domain  of deity)  functions  as  a warning  to  the  reader  that  the  implied  analogy  between  this  character  and  either  a  typical person  or  a  typical deity must be highly circumscribed. It seems to me that  this dual  message is reinforced by the form of the communication—the literary genre.  Generally, the genres of narrative and (epic) poetry featured strongly personal  protagonists, either persons or deities. But Gen. 1:1–25 is neither prose nor  poetry56—and it features a weakly personified character that is neither person  nor deity (as those concepts were normally understood). Like the genre, its  subject is something else. And now the real point: the character in Gen. 1:1–25 is so obviously unlike  any known entity that  the audience not only receives no warrant  to ascribe  social gender, but also would be hard pressed to do so. After all, masculinity  (the only realistic option between the genders) has meaning only with regard  to a corporeal body, interpersonal interactions, and cultural roles, all of which  are conspicuously absent in our passage. In summary, a plausible ancient reading of the Torah’s opening is that it was  introducing a deity whose breathtaking otherness demands “beyond gender”  categorization. Thus, despite possible prior audience conceptions of a male  Yrhrwrh, and despite the ascriptive personifications and anthropomorphisms  118  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="12"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions that the Torah subsequently employs, the character of God was supposed to  be viewed as beyond gender. For purposes of reading the Torah as a canonical  work, allow me to twist Hillel’s dictum: “What is inappropriate to the opening,  do not do to what’s joined to it—that is, the whole Torah. The rest is comt mentary”—and translation.57 Conveying the Ancient Situation in Contemporary English Having shown it to be plausible that the Torah’s composer(s) had good reason  to believe that the ancient audience would construe its deity as beyond gender,  I can now return to the question of translation. Which English rendering least  distorts our picture of that plausible ancient understanding of the Torah text:  regular use of  the customary masculine pronouns, or use of gendertneutral  language as the default? To answer this, I must touch on a crucial difference between Hebrew and  English, what  linguists  call  a  semantic asymmetry.58 As  is well  known,  in  contemporary English the pronoun “he” (and also “his/him/himself,” but for  simplicity I will focus on “he”) almost always refers to a person or an animal.  In biblical Hebrew, by contrast, the grammatically masculine pronoun hu’ cort responds not only to “he” but also to “it” or “one” or “this.” It often refers to  inanimate as well as animate antecedents. Much of the time, what hu’ conveys  has nothing to do with maleness. One implication of this HebrewtEnglish semantic asymmetry for translating  Godtlanguage is that the consistent use in English of masculine wording overr translates the ascription of personhood to God. As we have seen, the Torah’s  composer(s)  often  represented God  impersonally. Due  to  the nature of  the  Hebrew language, the depictions of God could flow from personal to impert sonal and back again without alteration at  the  level of grammar. Grammar  alone did not force either the composer(s) or the audience to decide whether  a given reference  to God involved a personification. In contrast,  the use of  “he” in English imposes personification on the text throughout. It obscures  the Torah’s varying representations of God (and, some would add, its varying  theologies).59 Furthermore, in both languages, when a particular personal subject is indeed  in view, masculine pronouns usually denote someone of masculine gender,  but they are used also when gender is unknown or irrelevant.60 This linguistic  119 </page> <page sequence="13"> David E.S. Stein feature leads to imprecision, by leaving ambiguous what exactly the speaker  believes about the referent’s social gender. Usually, the context of situation  then makes  that  belief  clear—but  not,  as we have  seen,  in  the  case of  the  Torah’s Godtlanguage in Hebrew. “Gendertsensitive”  (or  “gendertaccurate”)  Bible  translations  reduce  the  ambiguity of references to human beings by avoiding the generic usage of mast culine pronouns. Yet, until now, such renditions have preserved the traditional  masculine pronouns for God. God is the only “person” whose gender is not  overtly specified and yet is referred to as “he.”61 Ironically, due to this incont sistent English usage, God arguably comes across as a more male character  than ever. (Unfortunately, those pronouns, which are mostly an artifact of the  translation, misleadingly imply that the overblown male orientation is the work  of the Torah itself—which contemporary readers already tend to believe.) How best,  then,  to  preserve  the  gender  ambiguity  of Godtlanguage  in  a  gendertsensitive translation? By consistently applying—for both human and  divine referencees—the same grammatical rule: use gendertneutral language  as the default, while reserving masculine pronouns for male characters.62 A rendering of Godtlanguage that is gender neutral by default is not perfect.  Even when done well,  some awkwardness occasionally  remains. However,  two advantages clinch its superiority in a gendertsensitive translation. First, it  respects the indeterminacy of the Hebrew text. We cannot today prove whether  the Torah is presenting a male deity, or a deity beyond gender, or both. (Neither  possibility can be dismissed, for the matter went without saying.) The beauty  of a nuanced gendertneutral rendering is that it allows for all possibilities. It  does not prejudice our reading. Second, by conveying gender only where the  text makes an issue of it germane, such a translation allows us to experience  more precisely the (relatively limited) extent to which both divine personhood  and gender were part of the “ancient conversation.” 2. THREE RECENT ENTRANTS INTO THE FIELD OF TRANSLATION In recent decades, more than a dozen “gendertsensitive” or “gendertaccurate”  Bible translations have appeared in English. Remarkably, however, none of  them (at least none that we could find) has altered the customary pronouns  used  for God;  these  have  remained masculine. The  three  recent works  to  120  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="14"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions which I alluded at the start of this article have thus provided new options for  interested readers. The  first  of  these  to  appear,  in  2005, was  a  thorough  reworking  of The  Torah: A Modern Commentary as edited in the 1970s by W. Gunther Plaut  for the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC; currently known  as the Union for Reform Judaism, URJ). Redesigned in 2005 for ease of use  in synagogue worship, the revised edition incorporates a “gendertaccurate”  translation featuring a 1999 rendition of Genesis by the late Chaim Stern. For  the books of Exodus through Deuteronomy,63 the URJ Press asked me to revisit  the widely used NJPS (“New JPS”) translation, a contextual rendering of the  Hebrew text’s plain sense into the idiom of modern English.64 Marshalling an  unusual degree of cooperation between two publishers,  the URJ contracted  with the Jewish Publication Society (JPS) for joint ownership of a newly cret ated “gendertaccurate” adaptation of the NJPS version. As the revising editor,  I was privileged to work with URJ Press editortintchief Hara Person and JPS  editortintchief Ellen Frankel, as well as with Bible scholars Carol Meyers and  Adele Berlin as consulting editors. The changes that we made relate almost  exclusively to social gender.65 JPS itself then decided to build upon the URJtsponsored work by issuing  The Contemporary Torah: A GenderrSensitive Adaptation of the JPS Translar tion (2006), whose scholarly abbreviation is CJPS (“Contemporary JPS”).66  The CJPS effort engaged much the same editorial team, not only to extend the  same methodology to the book of Genesis (for added consistency), but also to  then revisit the treatment of certain expressions throughout the Torah in light  of what we learned from working on Genesis. URJ Press, in turn, borrowed back from JPS in updating the revised Modern  Commentary edition (third printing, 2006) to reflect new philological insights  gained from preparing The Contemporary Torah. In 2008, the URJ Press published The Torah: A Women’s Commentary, edited  by Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and cotedited by Andrea Weiss. This work (which  features commentary by one hundred women, most of them academic scholt ars or rabbis) incorporates, alongside the Hebrew text, the secondtgeneration  “gendertaccurate” URJ translation of the Torah, with a few local changes. In short, the three renditions are three iterations. Both URJ Press publicat tions (The Torah: A Modern Commentary and The Torah: A Women’s Comr mentary) feature essentially the same “gendertaccurate” translation; and their  121 </page> <page sequence="15"> David E.S. Stein renditions of Exodus through Deuteronomy are nearly identical to those found  in The Contemporary Torah, the “gendertsensitive” JPS version. What  are  the  distinctive  approaches  of  these  versions,  relative  to  other  translations and to each other, as they relate to Godtlanguage?67 Employing Masculine Pronouns Only Where Germane All three renditions incorporate a translation that renders the Torah’s refert ences to God in nontgendered English, unless there is contextual indication  that gender is germane. In practice, this meant avoiding gendered pronouns  for God.68 Typical editing approaches included the following: NJPS Stern’s Genesis or Adapted Versions of NJPS He said [God] said His people God’s people His covenant the Covenant His laws that He the laws that were enjoined upon you  enjoined upon you His voice the divine voice69 the fear of Him the fear of God In only one passage (Exodus 15:1–4, 21), in which God is depicted as a wart rior, did we editors recognize ancient poetic license and convey the imagery  via masculine pronouns.70 Representing God’s Name God’s name in Hebrew—known as the tetragrammaton—has no true equivat lent in English. Indeed, according to some Jewish traditions, it can barely be  represented even in Hebrew: In antiquity, some Jewish copyists of Hebrew  texts (working on what are now called the Dead Sea Scrolls) set the Name apart  from the rest of their manuscript by writing it an archaic Hebrew script. Nearly  as old is the religious taboo that precludes writing the Name in Hebrew with  vowels that would suggest its pronunciation. Even today, for Jews who read  the text devotionally, the Name cannot simply be transcribed into English in  122  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="16"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions the same way that, say, הָרׂשָ  (sarah) becomes “Sarah.” (Such distinctive treatt ment for God’s name appears to be a reflex of monotheism, as well as of the  Name’s reputed magical power.)71 The most  obvious distinction between CJPS and The Torah: A Women’s  Commentary, on the one hand, and prior Torah translations into English, on  the other, lies in their handling of the challenge posed by the tetragrammaton.  For example, in Gen. 27:20, blind Isaac asks his son (Jacob, disguised as Esau)  how he managed to return from the hunt so quickly. The son replies: יָנָפְל ָךיֶֹהלֱא הָוהְי הָרְקִה יּכִ OJPS (1917):72 “Because the Lord thy God sent me good speed.” NJPS (1962): “Because the Lord your God granted me good fortune.” Fox (1983): “Indeed, Yhwh your God made it happen for me.” NRSV (1989): “Because the Lord your God granted me success.” Alter (1996): “Because the Lord your God gave me good luck.” TAMC (2005): “The Eternal your God made it happen for me.” CJPS (2006): “Because your God הוהי granted me good fortune.” TAWC (2008): “Your God הוהי made it happen for me.”73 As indicated above, Jews have assigned special handling to God’s name for  a long time. Many translations—including four of the first five entries shown  above—have adopted a practice that dates back more than 2,200 years to the  very first known translation of the Torah, the ancient Jewish rendering into  Greek that scholars call the Septuagint. Throughout, it represented the Name  via the word kyrios (“Lord”).74 However, by common usage in contemporary English, “lord” is a male title.  For Jewish readers who seek to reconcile the English translation with contemt porary Judaism’s concept of a nontgendered God, rendering God’s personal  name as “the Lord” is like wearing male sunglasses to view the invisible deity:  “I’m not sure what I’m seeing, but it appears to be masculine.” The URJ  translation  solves  that problem by  rendering  the Name as  “the  Eternal,” an epithet that has served the North American Reform movement in  Bible translations and liturgy for at least fifteen years. Used well beyond the  bounds of the Reform movement, it reflects the popular idea that the Name  is related to the Hebrew verbal root for existence—a connection made by the  Torah itself in the Burning Bush episode (Exodus 3).75 123 </page> <page sequence="17"> David E.S. Stein Arguably, however, the Torah employs the tetragrammaton primarily as a  name, rather than as a title, attribute, description or declaration, and this surely  was the original audience’s foremost experience. The Torah’s deity is a named  dramatis persona. Accordingly,  the  producers  of  both The Contemporary  Torah and The Torah: A Women’s Commentary sought to present it as a name,  not an epithet. JPS and the editorial board for the women’s commentary both  concluded independently that no single, consistent rendering could do justice  to the Name—either as presented in the Bible or as treated thereafter in Jewish  lore—and so their renditions have left it untranslated and untransliterated.76 Preserving Gendered Images for God Occasionally, the Bible uses female imagery to express God’s relationship with  the people of Israel, as, for example, in Deuteronomy 32:13: עַלּסֶ ִמ ׁשַבְד ּוהֵקִנּיֵ ַו OJPS (1917): and He made him to suck honey out of the crag NJPS (1962): He fed him honey from the crag Fox (1983): he suckled them with honey from a boulder NRSV (1989): he nursed him with honey from the crags Alter (1996): He suckled him honey from the crag  TAMC (2005): Nursing them with honey from the crag CJPS (2006): Nursing them with honey from the crag TAWC (2008): Nursing them with honey from the crag The  implied  subject  is God. Thus,  the  verb’s  grammatical  form  is mascut line, yet  it designates what  is biologically a female activity.  In  the view of  the ancient audience, this passage would have had a feminine cast. As Carol  Meyers has written, “biblical texts acclaiming God as a provider [of food] . . .  evoke culturally specific images of women’s tasks.”77 In context, the female  ascription means that God sustains the people devotedly, as a mother nourishes  an infant. NJPS  obscures  the motherly  activity  attributed  to God. Apparently,  the  translators  reasoned  that  the word  chosen  to  render  it  should  express  the  figurative meaning of sustenance rather than the concrete one of nursing. But  124  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="18"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions this is poetry: The specificity of the image matters. All three of the new rendit tions convey the female ascription—without the distraction of a (gendered)  pronoun. When rendering  into English,  translators have  the option of  ignoring  the  vehicle’s gendered aspect and focusing instead on the message that it delivers  (e.g., by saying “ruler” instead of “king”). They do so at the cost of conveying  a true feel for Israelite society—the matrix that the Torah’s language takes as  a given. Ascriptions are of a piece with the wording that the Torah elsewhere  uses to refer to human characters. In the same vein, our translation teams chose  to represent literally the masculine ascriptions applied to God. (All three books  explicate such imagery in the commentary or endnotes.) Conclusion In their treatment of Godtlanguage, our three renditions of the Torah differ  from each other in small ways. This is partly a response to each publisher’s  respective goals and interests and partly a reflection of lessons learned during  each iteration. Yet,  taken  together,  the new  translations  share  some  significant  features.  They eschew the ascription of social gender to God when it is not germane,  avoiding the use of pronouns for God except in certain poetic passages. They  do not flinch from conveying concretely the text’s occasional depictions of  God via personal ascription—whether masculine or feminine. And they repret sent God’s name not as “the Lord” but either as “the Eternal” (in one version)  or without rendering it into English at all. Each  in  its own way,  these  three editions offer  readers a  rare experience  among gendertsensitive translations, of encountering directly the biblical God  as a persona who is at home in the ancient Near East, and who at the same  time is beyond gender. Notes: 1. This  article, which  I  dedicate  in memory of my  teacher Tikva FrymertKensky  (d. 2006),  reports  on  an  intellectual  journey  undertaken  partly  in  response  to  her  insistence that my rendering of Godtlanguage be nuanced according to the Hebrew  text.

For the purposes of this article, I need not specify when that “ancient  conversation” took place, nor how and when the Torah came into being. (The Torah  itself makes no claims as to how it was assembled, nor to the date of its promulgation  as a complete package, implying only that this occurred some time after Moses’ death.)  The linguistic and cultural factors that bear upon how the text’s Godtlanguage may be  translated are effectively constant throughout the 1,000tyear span within which various  experts each confidently fix a date for the Torah’s appearance. 3. This claim does not seem to be controversial in Jewish religious circles. For examt ple, I spoke with a rabbi who publicly represents an “ultratOrthodox” organization.  When informed that I had prepared a translation of the Torah with (mostly) gendert neutral God language, he responded approvingly with a rhetorical question: “Well,  who could object to that?” 4. “Targum” refers to one or more of the ancient rabbinic translations of the Bible  into the Aramaic vernacular. They famously paraphrased the biblical descriptions of  God, apparently so as to avoid language that depicted God in corporeal terms. In our  case, we avoided language that depicted God in male terms. 5. I have queried dozens of academic Bible scholars and found few who think that the  Torah’s God might have been anything other than male. As Carol Meyers observed, “It  is commonplace in biblical scholarship for the God of the Israelites . . . to be considt ered a male deity.” Eadem, “Gender and God in the Hebrew Bible: Some Reflections,”  in Rainer Kessler et al. (ed.), “Ihr Völker all, klatscht in die Hände!” Festschrift für  Erhard S. Gerstenberger Zum 65. Geburtstag  (Münster: Lit Verlag, 1997), p. 257.  In what follows, I confirm many of Meyers’s proposals and those of Tryggve N. D.  Mettinger, In Search of God: The Meaning and Message of the Everlasting Names  (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1988), pp. 204–207. 6. Methodological notes: (1) The Hebrew text whose translation is at issue is the  Masoretic text as we now know it today (that is, the text as standardized by Jewish  Bible scholars in the tenth century ce). (2) Because the enterprise of translation is  primarily a literary one, my argument does not require a historical reconstruction of  the Torah’s (or its purported constituent pieces’) actual reception by its audience.  126  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="20"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions (3) Because the meaning of a text is a product of the interaction between it and its  audience, I must consider its wording only after reconstructing what the composer(s)  of the text presumed with regard to the target audience’s assumptions about cultural  givens, reading conventions and authorial intent. History is vital to this endeavor,  but, again, such a reconstruction is not historical per se. (4) My goal is to recover the  text’s plaintsense meaning when taken on its own terms, at the time of its promulgat tion as the Torah per se. (5) For purposes of this article, the ancient audience’s act  of interpreting an authoritative oral performance of a literary work—which historit cally was their chief means of encountering such a work—was tantamount to our  reading the written text. Thus I will speak of an ancient audience “reading” a text as  convenient shorthand. 7. That the Israelites in fact held these contradictory beliefs has been the claim of  a number of historians of religion, such as Mark S. Smith, The Origins of Biblical  Monotheism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), pp. 90–93. 8. Tikva FrymertKensky notes that in light of what other ancient Near Eastern peot ples said about their deities, the Torah’s is conspicuously “not sexed.” Eadem, In the  Wake of the Goddesses: Women, Culture, and the Biblical Transformation of Pagan  Myth (New York: Free Press, 1992), pp. 187–189. However, silence is not the same  as a positive assertion that God is beyond gender. Two general observations by Bible  scholars will keep us properly cautious about interpreting the Torah’s lack of gender  explicitness. Edward Greenstein, in “The God of Israel and the Gods of Canaan: How  Different Were They?” Proceedings of the Twelfth World Congress of Jewish Studies  (Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish Studies, 1999, p. 58*), remarks: “the Torah and  most other biblical texts elaborate very little on the nature of God [in any respect].”  In the same vein, David H. Aaron, in Biblical Ambiguities: Metaphor, Semantics, and  Divine Imagery (Boston: Brill, 2001), has observed: “the fact that [in the Bible] God  goes undescribed must be placed in the context that except for ritual objects, basically  everything goes undescribed” (p. 184). 9. See, e.g., Karel van der Toorn (ed.), The Image and the Book: Iconic Cults, Anir conism, and the Rise of Book Religion in Israel and the Ancient Near East (Leuven:  Uitgeverij Peeters, 1997). 10. In  this  article,  “social  gender”  refers  to  the  socially  constructed  categories  of  “women” and “men,” as distinct from grammatical gender, which is a feature of many  languages, including Hebrew. In Hebrew, each of the two classes of nouns (masculine  or feminine) includes words that can refer to a man, a group of men, a woman, a group  of women, a mixed group of men and women, or a nontgendered individual or group.  See my article “The Grammar of Social Gender in Biblical Hebrew,” Hebrew Studies,  49 (forthcoming in 2008). 11.On the following points, see further my article “The Grammar of Social Gender”  (above, note 10). 127 </page> <page sequence="21"> David E.S. Stein 12. See Tosefta Bikkurim  2; BT Yevamot  83a–b;  and Maimonides, Mishneh Torah,  ‘Laws of ’Ishut’ 2.24–26. I adduce posttbiblical usage under an assumption of historical  uniformity of the grammar of personal reference. 13. That some other ancient Near Eastern cultures recognized a warrior goddess does  not mean that making war was a woman’s role. On the contrary, warmaking was quintt essentially male, part of the very delineation of genders: Both literary sources and  grave goods (items buried alongside human remains) consistently associate weaponry  with men as opposed to women. Those occasional females who did bear arms were  considered notttrulytwomen; likewise, battle goddesses were imagined as something  other than true women. Given such mores, I concluded that in the eyes of the ancient  audience, the ascription of God as warrior was a masculine image. See, e.g., Harry  A. Hoffner,  Jr.,  “Symbols  for Masculinity  and  Femininity: Their Use  in Ancient  Near Eastern Sympathetic Magic Rituals,” Journal of Biblical Literature, 85 (1966),  pp. 326–334; Kathleen McCaffrey, “Reconsidering Gender Ambiguity  in Mesopot tamia:  Is  a Beard  Just  a Beard?”  in S.

See, e.g., Lawrence LeShan, Alternate Realities: The Search for the Full Human  Being (New York: M. Evans and Co., 1976); Arthur Green, See My Face, Speak My  Name: A Contemporary Jewish Theology (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1992); and  James Kugel, The God of Old: Inside the Lost World of the Bible (New York: Free  Press, 2003). 15. Personification was not a “metaphor” in the sense of a language performance— the result of the speaker’s creative burst of insight; rather, by the time of the Bible  it  had  been  institutionalized  in  the  cultural  discourse,  converting what  had  once  been a metaphor into an “idiom.” On this terminological distinction, see Menachem  Dagut, HebrewrEnglish Translation: A Linguistic Analysis of Some Semantic Probr lems (Haifa: University of Haifa, 1978), p. 98. At the same time, personification was a  “generic metaphor” in the sense of a mapping from one conceptual domain to another;  see George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Metaphors We Live By (Chicago: University  of Chicago Press, 1980). On the ubiquity of deity, see John H. Walton, Ancient Near  Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the  Bible (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2006), p. 87. 16.A semantic anomaly is the ensign that a figure of speech proudly holds aloft, to  distinguish it from a mere literal utterance. As Andrea Weiss explains, the audience’s  interpretive question “does not concern whether or not the utterance is literally true,  but, instead, whether or not the usage . . . can be viewed as semantically anomalous.  128  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="22"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions The focus centers on a linguistic, not an ontological issue.” Eadem, Figurative Lanr guage in Biblical Prose Narrative: Metaphor in the Book of Samuel (Leiden: Brill,  2006), p. 82. 17. It seems worthwhile to remind ourselves of some of the numerous ways that the  ancients showed they did not equate deities with people. For example, in some written  languages they tagged the names of deities with distinct markers. In literary convent tion, a person—regardless of social rank—who encountered a personified deity (or the  deity’s authorized representative) was expected to bow and express verbal deference.  Again according to the ancients’ explicit beliefs, human beings existed to serve deit ties—at least in theory. In addition (as we shall see later), the ancients did not relate  to deities only as persons; personhood was perceived as only one facet of a deity. In  contrast, living human beings were always persons. 18. The wording of this sentence and the analytical process it conveys follow the diagt nostic schema laid out by Aaron, Biblical Ambiguities (above, note 8), pp. 116–17,  124. Later in his book, Aaron argues cogently that within the ancient worldview, it  went without saying that iconic imagery was not “literal” (that is, expressive of ontot logical  identity). Similarly,  I am arguing  that  in  the Bible, as  in  the ancient world  generally,  it went without  saying  that  literary  imagery  about God was  not  literal;  and this convention did not need to be stated because such ascriptive idioms were so  thoroughly a part of the culture. 19. The role of fatherthouseholder is also ascribed to God in Num. 12:7, and Deut.  28:10 and 30:3. (Moses calls God Israel’s “father” in Deut. 32:6 and 18, but different  reading rules apply within the genre of poetry.) 20. Similarly Aaron, Biblical Ambiguities (above, note 8), p. 63; and Erhard S. Gerstent berger, Yahweh the Patriarch: Ancient Images of God and Feminist Theology (English  transl. by Frederick J. Gaiser; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996), p. 6. On householdtkinship  imagery as the root metaphor for ancient Near Eastern society at all levels, see David  J. Schloen, The House of the Father as Fact and Symbol: Patrimonialism in Ugarit and  the Ancient Near East (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2001). 21.Kilamuwa  Inscription  (ca.  825  bce), KAI  24,  line  10; Azatiwada  Inscription  (ca. 720 bce), KAI 26, A.1.3. 22. (My  translation—D.S.) With  its  indefinite  and  nonspecific  referent,  the word  melakhim (“monarchs”) by itself does not ascribe social gender. Nevertheless, I cont strue the plaintsense connotation here as male (“kings”) partly because of the social  context: in the ancient Near East, the default ruler was male. Also, the literary context  of hyperbole makes the imagery more compelling if taken as male. 23. See, e.g., the citations in Mark S. Smith, The Early History of God: Yahweh and  the Other Deities in Ancient Israel (2nd edition; Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2002),  pp. 139–140. 129 </page> <page sequence="23"> David E.S. Stein 24.Gerstenberger, Yahweh the Patriarch (above, note 20), p. 10. 25.Why the composer(s) of the text chose male more often than female imagery was  probably to convey the ultimacy of this deity, for in a patriarchal society certain (relat tively few) men nominally had both the last word and the final responsibility. This  explanation might account for why the high gods were male in Ugarit, Asshur, Babyt lon and elsewhere. See my brief discussion in The Contemporary Torah, “Dictiont ary of Gender in the Torah,” s.v. “Male metaphors for God”; and see Gerstenberger,  Yahweh the Patriarch (above, note 20), pp. 5–6, 9–10. 26. Some contemporary interpreters do construe the male imagery as reflecting God’s  gender, which can be a valid exegesis following an interpretive strategy other than a  plaintsense reading in terms of ancient conventions. 27.Herein I use “Yrhrwrh” to represent the tetragrammaton, ה–ו–ה–י (see further below).  The “w” represents the apparent pronunciation of the letter vav in ancient times. 28. See,  e.g., André Lemaire, The Birth of Monotheism: The Rise and Disappearr ance of Yahwism (Washington, DC: Biblical Archaeology Society, 2007); cf. Frymert  Kensky, In the Wake of the Goddesses (above, note 8), pp. 86–87, 188–189. 29.Greenstein, “The God of Israel” (above, note 8), p. 52*. That is, the portrayals in the  genres of myth, epic, hymn, narrative and law differ from each other in tone, register,  degree of resort to anthropomorphism, and so forth. To Greenstein’s observation I add  that attribution of social gender (or not) is a variable factor in the ancient depictions. 30. Similarly Aaron, Biblical Ambiguities (above, note 8), p. 152; see further above,  note 18. Scholars of ancient Near Eastern religion have found that personalization of  deities developed long after the conception of deity itself; see, e.g., Thorkild Jacobt sen, The Treasures of Darkness: A History of Mesopotamian Religion (New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1976). I do not mean to claim that personal and nontpersonal  representations of deity were entirely equivalent in all contexts. 31. Siegfried Morenz, Egyptian Religion (English transl. by Ann E. Keep; London:  Methuen &amp; Co.,  1973),  p.  20. That  the  Egyptians  viewed  human  and  nonhuman  depictions as equivalent representations of the same deity is suggested, for example,  by depictions of stylized trees  labeled “Goddess X  in her name  ‘Tree Y.’ ” As icot nographer Othmar Keel explains, “in the sacred tree . . . the otherwise invisible and  incomprehensible goddess . . . becomes visible and comprehensible.” Idem, Goddess  and Trees, New Moon and Yahweh: Ancient Near Eastern Art and the Hebrew Bible  (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998), p. 48; see also Johanna H.

For example, in the Levant, including Israelite settings, from the late Bronze Age  until well into the Iron Age, a “great goddess” was depicted variously as a woman with  tree branches growing out of her, or as a tree with a woman growing out of it, or as a tree  without a human figure but with a pair of goattlike animals (caprids) stretching up to eat  from its branches. Usually—but by no means always—these depictions appeared with  other symbols of the goddess alongside. See Keel, Goddess and Trees, Part 1, no. 13, and  see pp. 35, 47–48; cited also by Stuckey, “Great Goddesses,” p. 35, and see the discussion  on pp. 45, 49–50 (both above, note 31). See esp. Pithos A from Kuntillet Ajrud, dated to  the early eighth century bce, in Keel, Goddess and Trees, pp. 210–217. During the period  in which, according to the Bible, Kings David and Solomon reigned, the various denit zens of the Land of Israel typically represented deities on scarabs and seals via attribute  animals and related entities, rather than via human figures; see Othmar Keel and Christ toph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel (English transl.  by Thomas H. Trapp; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1998), pp. 133–175. Archeologists have  also found numerous stelae in ancient Canaan (at Israelite and nontIsraelite sites) and in  neighboring lands, generally lacking graphic images. Regarding what these “blank” or  “empty” monuments suggest about worshippers’ view of their deity as a person (or not),  David Aaron rightly cautions: “Nothing in the artifactual remains discloses theological  principles.” Idem, Biblical Ambiguities (above, note 8), p. 182. 34. Further  evidence  that  social  gender was  not  seen  as  an  absolute  property  of  a  given deity may be derived from the way the ancients seem, over the centuries,  to  have switched around the social gender  they ascribed to some of  their deities. For  example, in some places in the ancient Near East, the deity represented by the sun  was understood to be male; in other places, female. Likewise for the moon, the dawn  and the dew: The same deity, with (essentially) the same name, was not everywhere  ascribed the same gender. See, for example, Samuel A. Meier, “Shahar,” Anchor Bible  Dictionary (1999), V, cols. 1150–1151. Cf. William J. Fulco’s speculation (“Ishtar,”  Anchor Bible Dictionary) that the Akkadian goddess Ishtar was originally a male deity.  It seems to me that an equation of “male” and “female” deities could occur only if the  essence of divinity was imagined apart from personhood and social gender. 35.

Geller cites Israel Knohl, who collated  certain passages of the Torah on the basis of linguistic and literary criteria and then  observed that one such set of passages never represents the deity in anthropomorphic  terms or expresses God’s actions in terms of physical features or emotions. As Knohl  puts it,  in the Priestly sections of the Torah, “the divine nature associated with the  name of YHWH is impersonal—free of any marks of personality.” Knohl, The Divine  Symphony (above, note 38), p. 33; see further idem, The Sanctuary of Silence: The  Priestly Torah and the Holiness School (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995), pp. 125–137.  The Bible  also  depicts God  impersonally  by  framing  scenes  so  that God  remains  offstage: “God appears in most biblical stories only indirectly. . . .

As a commontgender  (“epicene”) noun, it can refer to either a male or a female deity. In this passage it is a  status term; like “pharaoh,” that status can be taken by either a man or a woman. As  such, the gender inflections of verbs and adjectives would be expected to follow the  semantic orientation (social gender) of the occupant. See 1 Kings 11:5, 33; Burnett,  A Reassessment (above, note 44), pp. 27, 60; and Bruce K. Waltke and M.

Contrast this passage’s bland predicates with the anthropomorphic  verbs of poetic creation accounts in Psalms 90:2 (birth, and bring forth via labor) and  104:1–7 (put on, drape over, stretch out, set into place, ride upon, fix in place, and  cover up—with  the Creator meanwhile  interacting with messengers and servants).  Reinforcing the weakness of ’elohim’s personification in Gen. 1:1–25 is the absence of  other personae with whom to interact. This would be highly significant for the ancient  audience, since, in the worldview of their grouptoriented culture, the identity of both  humans and deities derived from social relations. An individual could hardly be said to  exist alone.

The verb brrr’ was never used (either in the Bible or, as far as we know, in the  ancient Near East) to refer to the activity of a person. Similarly for brrrk: “Blessing” by  a deity is a grant that manifests impersonally (as in Psalms 67:7), in contradistinction  to the human act of “blessing” (a personal prayer). 52.

The next literary unit (2:4b–3:24), by persistently referring to its protagonist via  the highly unusual dual formula Yrhrwrh ’elohim (God Yrhrwrh), seems to confirm  the distinctive nature of the opening unit’s ’elohim. Apparently the composer(s) of  Genesis did not expect the audience to equate the ’elohim of the first scene with the  Yrhrwrh they already knew, for otherwise the name Yrhrwrh alone would thereafter  have been enough. 56.

Playing on BT Shabbat 31a. Historians of religion, however, engage in a different  enterprise. Rather than bind themselves by the principle of canon, they take individual  passages out of canonical context and construe them as source “documents” or reflexes  of pretcanonical views of God. This in turn can warrant translating the passages in  gendered terms. 58. See Dagut, HebrewrEnglish Translation (above, note 15), p. 21. 59. The same can be said for relative pronouns: Personhood is not distinguished in  Hebrew, but it is in English (“who” versus “which”). In this realm, however, gender  is not at issue. 60.Examples of the standard use of masculine pronouns to mean “the subject in quest tion” include: (1) “That car with the darkened windows is weaving dangerously in and  out of traffic; who does that guy think he is?” (2) “What a beautiful dog! What breed  is he? What’s his name?” (3) “Merely to personify God would have been to disparage  Him. . . . In the prophetic mind there was a dissociation of the human—of any biologit cal function or social dependence—from the nature of God.” Abraham J. Heschel, The  Prophets, II (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962), pp. 49–50. 61. For example, the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV; National Council of the  Churches of Christ  in  the United States of America, 1989). With regard  to human  beings, it does make some exceptions, as its preface states: “Only very occasionally  134  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="28"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions has the pronoun ‘he’ or ‘him’ been retained in passages where the reference may have  been to a woman as well as to a man” (Bruce Metzger, “To the Reader”). 62. Some observers might believe that rendering with male pronouns produces wordt ing “closer” to the original. In fact, however, most pronouns for God that appear in  translation do not correspond to independent pronouns in the Hebrew text; rather, they  are supplied by translators according to the needs of English idiom. Nor can the use  of masculine Godtlanguage in English be justified by a general claim that it reflects  the  “literal meaning” of  the Hebrew wording. Masculine  language  in Hebrew has  more than one “literal” sense, and Mark Strauss aptly states the governing linguistic  truth: “It is context alone that determines which sense of a lexeme is intended within  its semantic range”; idem, “Current Issues in the GendertLanguage Debate,” in Glen  Scorgie et al. (eds.), The Challenge of Bible Translation (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondert van, 2003), p. 134. The issue, then, is which English equivalent produces the least  distortion in a given context. 63. The URJ Press had intended for Stern to translate the entire Torah, but he passed  away in 2001, after completing his rendering of Genesis. 64. The NJPS Torah (formerly known as the New Jewish Version), first published in  1962, underwent four significant revisions, published in 1967, 1985, 1992 and 1999.  Its translation committee strove to establish the text’s plain sense as the author meant  to convey it to the Torah’s first audience, while taking into account postbiblical Jewish  interpretation. The translators explicitly valued clarity of expression, and they sought  to emphasize a religious message. See the JPS HebrewrEnglish Tanakh (Philadelphia,  1999), Preface to the 1985 English Edition, p. xxiii. 65. See The Torah: A Modern Commentary (revised edition; New York: URJ Press,  2005), Preface to the Revised Edition, pp. xxv–xxxi. By “gendertaccurate,” the pubt lisher meant  that  the  rendering of  terms referring  to human beings  (as opposed  to  Godtlanguage) accurately reflects the understanding of the text’s ancient audience,  given the latter’s assumptions regarding social gender. 66. The Contemporary Torah: A GenderrSensitive Adaptation of the JPS Translar tion (Philadelphia: JPS, 2006), Preface, pp. v–xxxv. The publisher preferred the term  “gendertsensitive” to “gendertaccurate” out of an abundance of caution, so as not to  “claim too much authority” for an adaptation with a somewhat innovative methodt ology. It viewed CJPS as complementing rather than replacing the NJPS translation  (Ellen Frankel, personal communication, Feb. 14, 2006). 67.Most of the effort in preparing the renditions focused on the assignment of gender  to the Torah’s human characters. See further the Preface to The Contemporary Torah  (above, note 66). 68.Often the Hebrew wording itself does not contain a subject pronoun, but only a  verbal inflection that implicitly refers to God as the subject. As for the circumlocut 135 </page> <page sequence="29"> David E.S. Stein tions to avoid a pronoun in English, translating into another language is never solely  an endeavor of wordtfortword replacement, especially if the rendering is intentionally  cast into the idioms of the target language. 69.Apart from one instance in a poetic passage in Genesis (1:27), these translations  render the possessive inflection adjectivally only in Deuteronomy. The revising transt lators intended this as a reflex of that book’s distinctive rhetorical style. See the Preface  to The Contemporary Torah (above, note 66), p. xxxv, note 35. 70.On the warrior as a masculine image, see above, note 13. 71. See  further,  e.g., my online article “God’s Name  in a GendertSensitive  Jewish  Translation,” SBL Forum (Summer 2006), reprinted in The Bible Translator, 58/3 (July  2007), pp. 105–110; and DDD, s.v. “Yahweh.” 72.Key: OJPS: Old  Jewish Publication Society version  (Philadelphia:  JPS, 1917);  Fox: Everett Fox, as incorporated in The Five Books of Moses (New York: Schocken,  1995); NRSV: New Revised Standard Version (above, note 61); Alter: Robert Alter,  as incorporated in The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary (New  York: Norton,  2004); TAMC: The Torah: A Modern Commentary,  revised  edition  (above, note 66); TAWC: Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and Andrea Weiss (eds.), The Torah:  A Women’s Commentary (New York: URJ Press, 2008). 73.With respect  to God, English translations have customarily employed a Hebrat ism: They place an appositivetthattdefinestrelationship after the epithet or Name (for  example, “the Lord your God”). Perhaps this arrangement has been preferred because  the definite article would otherwise break up the apposition (“your God the Lord”).  In contrast, with respect to other personas, NJPS, for example, opts for normal Engt lish idiom, as in the following examples: ָךיִחָא לֶבֶה יֵא (“Where is your brother Abel?”  Gen. 4:9); ָךּמְ ִא לֶבֶזיִא (“your mother Jezebel,” 2 Kings 9:22); םֶהיֵֹהלֱא ןֹוגָדְל (“to their god  Dagon,” Judg. 16:23). Distinctively, both CJPS and The Torah: A Women’s Commenr tary treat an apposition with the Name in accordance with English idiom. Hence, in  the present example (Gen. 27:20), CJPS reads “your God הוהי” rather than “הוהי your  God.” This approach helps the reader, when encountering the Hebrew word in an otht erwise English text, to construe it as a name. More importantly, it affords the reader an  encounter with the Name that is closer to how the ancient audience experienced it. 74. The  audience  for  the  Septuagint  lived  in  the  polytheistic milieu  of Hellenistic  Egypt. Apparently the translation’s producers wanted to emphasize that their Deity  was not merely one more named god among many. 75.URJ translator Chaim Stern cited as precedent the rendering der Ewige, a German  coinage by the Jewish philosopher and translator Moses Mendelssohn (1783). Further  precedents may be found in the renderings L’éternel, used in the French version most  widely  accepted  among Christians,  by Louis Segond  (1874);  and “the Eternal”  in  James Moffatt’s translation into English (1924), which was influenced by the French  136  •  Nashim 15 (2008) </page> <page sequence="30"> Representation of God in the Torah and in Three Recent Renditions practice. See Anthony Byatt, “Handling the Tetragrammaton in English Translations,”  Bible Collectors’ World (Oct.–Dec. 1987). 76. This is akin to the practice of some ancient copyists of biblical books in Greek  translation, who consistently inscribed the Name using Hebrew letters. On the editorial  decision process for handling the tetragrammaton in The Contemporary Torah, see my  article “God’s Name” (above, note 71). Regarding pronunciation, The Contemporary  Torah offers the following guidance: “We invite those who read this translation aloud  to pronounce the Name via whatever term that they customarily use for it” (Preface,  p. xxvii). 77.Carol Meyers, “Female Images of God,” in eadem et al.
