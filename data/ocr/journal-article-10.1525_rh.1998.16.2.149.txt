<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> JAMES J. PAXSON  Personification's Gender  Abstract: The fact that classical and early medieval allegorical  personifications were exclusively female has long perplexed literary  scholars and rhetoricians. Although arguments have been made about this  gendering using grammatical formalism for the most part, an examination  of rhetoric's own deep structure—that is, the discursive metaphors it has  always employed to talk about tropes and figures—promises to better  articulate the gendered bases of the figure. Using analytical tactics drawn  from Paul de Man's discussions of prosopopeia, this essay re-examines  some of the rhetorical record along with programmatic imagery from  patristic writings in order to demonstrate how women theinselves could  serve as the "figures of figuration."  Ithough John Bunyan's aUegory The Pilgrim's Progress (1678)  provides an overwhelming majority of personified or  typified characters who are male,' early Uterary  personification in the West depended upon the complete  opposite: in HeUenic, Roman, and much medieval art and aUegorical  Uterature, personified abstractions (i. e. virtues, vices, emotions, natural  forces, phUosophical concepts) were exclusively female. The cultic  character of such female abstiactions in Roman popular veneration.  ' The Pilgrim's Progress from this World to That which is to Come, ed. Roger Sharrock, 2nd  ed.

Along with Christian, the poem's male  protagonist, we have dozens of male figures who even bear the title "Mr"; others are  caricatured, hyper-masculine toughs (Faint-heart, Mistrust, and Guilt of Dead-man's lane)  who beat and rob weaklings (Little-faith).

Luxon, Literal Figures: Puritan  Allegory and the Reformation Crisis in Representation (Chicago: The University of Chicago  Press, 1995) pp. 190-93, 204-05, for a discussion of these hyper-masculine figures not so  much as "realistic" reflections of the seventeenth-century street world, but as ingredients in  Bunyan's self-reflexive allegory of the crisis in seventeenth-century hermeneutics and  theology.  © The International Society for the History of Rhetoric, Rhetorica, Volume XVI,  Number 2 (Spring 1998)  149  </page> <page sequence="2"> jgo RHETORICA  made evident tiirough modem epigraphy and archeology, has been  long recognized,' whUe the catalog of female personifications in  Uterature is almost as vast; the briefest survey caUs to mind the marked  importance of these figures' feminine status.

All who have studied medieval aUegory, historians of rhetoric and  Uterary critics aUke, have sooner or later wondered about this gendered  state of affairs, although the problem has never proved to be of much  importance let alone a disabling issue. Indeed female personifications  are a given in medieval Uterature, a fact that has made tiie issue almost  invisible in Uterary scholarship. Since the theory of personification itself  has been peripheral in Uterary studies, discussion of the gender  dimension of this theory has been minimal. This modem trend foUows  the ancient and medieval one of neglecting personification virtually in  toto: in the Rhetoric, Aristotle had taken up no more than the  metaphorical transfer of animate quaUties to inanimate things,'" whUe  Matthew of Vendome avoided the term completely in the Ust of figures  cential to his Ars Versificatoria, although his four-fold graphing of  metaphor {quadripertita metaphora)" mimics CJuintiUan's practice of  charting the lines of tiansference in that trope and thereby aUudes to  Aristotle's brief remarks on figurative animation.

C) fumish remarks, however brief, that could have provided  definitive direction for poets. Demetrius in fact provides the very ffrst  published definition of personification in which he makes the  embodying of an abstraction as a female body a formal requisite of the  device:  Another figure of thought—the so-called "prosopopoeia"—may be  employed to produce energy of style, as in the words: "Imagine that your  ancestors, or Hellas, or your native land, assuming a woman's form,  should address such and such reproaches to you."''  Demetrius' definition may weU have been exemplary for succeeding  generations of rhetoricians. And although it seems reductive and  simple, it already contains a kind of figural self-reflexive play that  would characteristicaUy inhabit aUegorical personification: after aU,  Demetrius confronts us with a paranomastic playing off between the  embodied "woman's form" (gyrmikos schema) and the latest "figure of  thought" {schema dianoias) in his ongoing inventory. The instiuctive  paranomasia—or use of the Uteral sense of a word and the figural sense  of that same word both in one sentence—^permits a cognitive conflation  of woman's form or body to the very idea of rhetorical figure  {schema...schema), whUe this conflation is enabled through the overt and  apodictic act of defining prosopopeia. Might this subtie figural self- reflexivity somehow have propagated itself, however tacitly, in the  discourse of theoretical rhetoric and aUegorical poetics?  Certainly one could expect propagation of this semi-consdous  realization through the more authoritative Rhetorica ad Herennium. Here  too one finds another ur-definition of personification, which is labeled  conformatio in the text's late-Republican Latin. The definition is compact,  efficient, and buUt around the primary example of the speaking female  city:  Conformatio est cum aliqua quae non adest persona confingitur quasi  adsit, aut cum res muta aut informis fit eloquens, et forma ei et oratio  adtribuitur ad dignitatem adcommodata aut actio quedam, hoc pacto:  "Quodsi nunc haec urbs invictissima vocem mittat, non hoc pacto loquatur:  'Ego...nunc vestris seditionibus, o cives, vexor.'"

'I...am now vexed, O citizens,  by your dissensions.'""  The personified city caUs to mind the numinous female tyche who were  thought to watch over cities and enterprises as much as it does the  embodiment of a merely non-human entity or object, a "mute thing" {res  muta) given speech. But the significant polyptoton (the same root or  word set up in different grammatical cases or compounds throughout a  sentence) in the definition (Conformatio...informis...forma) evokes the  traditional word for trope or figure in Roman rhetoric—/orma (the  interchangeable synonym to figura and translation of Greek schema)—  whUe tying it to the image of a female landscape, territory, or  institution. Moreover, the designation of this programmatic female  personification as urbs invictissima—an "unconquerable city"—denotes  that she has never been taken nor could be taken, either in Uteral  miUtary terms or in figural personal terms. The Rhetorica ad Herennium's  personified city is an impenetrated female body, one implying  semanticaUy that a female body, also by definition, is tiiat which may be  penetrated through a violent, masculine invasion, incursio, a phaUic  "rurming or going in." One might therefore wonder whether these sorts  of programmatic though subtle rhetorical features in this watershed text  didn't have a cumulative effect on later writers, the allegorists, whose  stock in trade was the canny reflection on tiopological discourse and  the imagery of bodies.  In this essay, 1 wiU provide a new theory of personification that wiU  try to account for the fixed femininity of personified characters in the  allegories produced through the late Middle Ages. (In so doing, I wiU be  dealing with instances of fuU-scale, narrative character invention and  not so much with the myriad Uterary instances of omamental  prosopopeia, or what Morton Bloomfield once christened simple  "animate metaphors".)'* This theory should help to shed some Ught on  " Rhetorica ad Herennium, trans, and ed.

I wUl assert  that gendered personification in ancient and medieval Uterature in part  reflects R. Howard Bloch's description of a persistent and powerful  (though not omnipresent) discourse of misogyny." I wUl speculate that,  reciprocaUy, if there was a culture of misogyny represented in certain  Latin writers, then perhaps the automatic liiUdng of women to  personification helped promote it.  Since "Personification's Gender" is orUy a preliminary study  tieating the discursivity of rhetorical tropes and the cultural practices of  gender construction, it is my intent to provide a broad theory of  personification's gendered structure rather than a documented  rehearsal of the social, historical, and textual sites expressive of  medieval gender's social representation in the Uterature beyond the few  and programmatic rhetorical sources I do address. The early gendering  of personified characters as women records, I wiU argue, the ideology of  rhetoric's deep structure, a structure that had occulted personification's  dependence on unages of gendered bodies and social relations. But  because medieval rhetoric or poetics never or minimaUy addressed the  gender of personification, my project wiU involve reconstructing this  semiotics of tropes and gender, for no such semiotics existed or could  exist, in explicit form, prior to contemporary rhetoric, poetics, and  gender study." At best, one finds tantalizing microaUegories of  R. Howard Bloch, Medieval Misogyny and the Invention of Western Rorrmntic Love  (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1991). Aware of the initial theoretical reprisals  launched against Bloch from feminists in the field, 1 furthermore opt to engage what  Thomas Hahn has identified as the still institutionally sound and useful core of Bloch's  project. Hahn writes: "Instead of reproducing medieval misogyny, as a misogynist or as an  "objective" scholar, Bloch uses his immense framework to resituate medieval texts, and so  to de-naturalize gender. Bloch's arguments result in a discursive definition of femininity,  seen in relation to social practices and relations, rather than an anatomical definition based  upon expressive records of experience."

" For a survey of classical and medieval definitions of personification, see James J.  Paxson, The Poetics of Personification (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994) pp. 8- 34. From my brisk survey one finds that the many pronouncements on allegory,  personification, and other related tropes or figures found in classical and medieval treatises  yield Uttle that's useful to the modem task of structuralizing tropes in terms of gender. 1  should reaffirm that the institutionalized discourse of such self-reflexive theorization in  </page> <page sequence="7"> Personification's Gender 155  gendered personification in some of the main texts of rhetoric and  poetics, as my preceding look at Demetrius and the Rhetorica ad  Herennium only begins to suggest.  This reconstruction thus entails my displacement (or modification)  of personification's canonical medieval definitions by the contemporary  definitions enabled by the deconstructionists, begiiming with Paul de  Man; that is to say, reconstruction can succeed through deconstruction,  whUe an old grairunatical problem can find recourse only through the  structures of rhetoric and through our recognition of a "cognitive  misprision" situated at the intersection of grammar and rhetoric. In  trulii, medieval definitions of the trope found in rhetorical or poetic  manuals do not weU aid current poststructural analysis because those  definitions are so minunal. Most medieval defirutions foUow the terse  but inclusive one suppUed in the Rhetorica ad Herennium. In addition, the  more complex definition of prosopopeia offered by QuintUian in the  Institutio oratoria enjoyed wide employment." This juridical conception,  in which the device serves a lawyer who must "speak through" his  cUent, must have had great power and value, even to the point of  serving as the plausible formal ground out of which grew nothing less  rhetoric, poetics, and grammatica had not yet arisen, i.e. not in the Foucauldian sense of new  knowledge production possible only through epistemic evolutions and revolutions. The  epistemic system that had arisen and become fixed during the first millennium was the  institution of grammatical, rhetorical, and hermeneutical practices and enterprises central  to the emergent "culture of the book" rather than the culture of the personal. The most  impressive treatment of this genealogy is Martin Irvine, The Making of Textual Culture:  "Grammatica" and Literary Theory, 350-1100 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994).  See pp. 1-8 for a general overview of Irvine's operating thesis: the medieval grammatical  curriculum, an entire cultural apparatus that inculcated the creation of a literate culture  trained to pen, copy, read, decode, and collate texts, both promoted and derived from a  macrometaphor of text as culture and culture as text. Individual documents as well as  tropes would have been conceptualized always as the mutually constitutive building  blocks and the end products of an all-pervading grammatical institution with practicality  always underlying its self-conception. This essay, "Personification's Gender", proceeds to  make a broad sketch of how gender and the cognitive aporia, not the efficacy, of rhetoric  served as the comparable (but latent) macrometaphors in a tiope-fixated system of textual  production.

The  dissemination of Quintilian's text and, in particular, his famous definition of prosopopeia  involved the text's "mutilist" medieval history; see James J. Murphy, Rhetoric in the Middle  Ages: A History of Rhetorical Theory from Saint Augustine to the Renaissance (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1974) pp. 125-26.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 156 RHETORICA  than a good segment of the medieval drama, as Jody Enders has  argued."  Yet the bestowal of laurels upon prosopopeia by Enders recalls the  bestowal conferred upon the trope by de Man. His long career writing  about prosopopeia culmmated in the deconstructive defirutions now  commonplace in postmodern poetics: prosopopeia, the "master trope of  poetic discourse,"" came to sigrufy for de Man the impulse behind aU  tiopological processes and aU acts of human perception or cognition;  prosopopeia was the linguistic image of the mind's projective  tendencies. However, de Man stiU considered the trope to mean the  imparting of voice to a non-human agent, as weU as the conferring of  human form on that which is abstract—a process de Man at one time  preferred to call "anthropomorphism."TM Like his deconstructive theory  of aUegory, de Man's theory of personification tiansformed what was  once an isolated trope among the repertofre of rhetorical tropes and  figures into a universal cognitive modaUty. This was a tiansformation  spurred by the post-Romantic conflation of prosopopeia, animism, and  the "pathetic fallacy" (foUowing Ruskin's intervention in the long  dialogue); it was a tiansformation which de Man labored to promote  and institutionaUze.^' Paul de Man was personification's greatest  publicist.  But in the more tradition-bound language of the history of rhetoric,  de Man's definition of personification must itself be seen as highly  figurative. He had troped what was once the institutionaUy proper  name of a trope by so greatly expanding the meaning of personification  or prosopopeia. Put in more technical terms, his definition of  prosopopeia is abusive; it is "catachretical"."

This involves an agenda no longer radical;  indeed, one can find positive re-evaluations of de Man's tiopological  descriptions coming from the quarter of traditional rhetoric history."  Despite the ahistorical impUcations of de Man's approach in  relation to pre-modem rhetoric and poetics, I beUeve that the subject of  gendered personification can stiU benefit from reinterpretation  according to the ongoing de Manian project. Furthermore, my  reconstructive project should help rescue de Manian rhetorical theory  from a charge related to the one of ahistoricism: I refer to the eschewal  of gender often seen to inhabit de Man's whole critical production." I  wiU therefore demonstrate how personification's gender depends in  large part on the analytical confusion between the trope and certain  culturaUy programmed macrometaphors used in the Middle Ages to  describe rhetoric itself. In short, personified characters in classical or  early medieval Uterature were women because Personification as a  concept (and itself personified) could be thought of as having the  gendered quaUties of the feminine.

SOME ]VIODERN THEORIES OF PERSONIFICATION AND GENDER  Prior to poststmctural attempts at theorizmg personification's  gender, conventional approaches have not proven unproductive. There  seem to be three general theories about the femirunity of early  personifications. Adolf KatzeneUenbogen, twentieth-century expert in  medieval iconography, declared:  True to classical tradition, Prudentius personifies the opposing forces of the  soul as female figures. In so doing, he lends the Vices the character rather  of mortal sinners than of inescapable demons and thus, using the wealth of  everyday experience, he lessens the fear of the power of evil.  KatzeneUenbogen's point—made as an opening gesture in a book that  StiU serves as one of the most influential introductions to aUegorical art  and Uterature—rests on something of a reader-response position. This  affective explanation represents neither a historicism nor a formalism of  aUegorical iconography, which, as such, is not why it is teoubling. The  problem Ues in the way KatzeneUenbogen's terse formulation posits an  automatic association in late Roman culture between "women" and  "mortal sinners" rather than numinous or supernatural agents like  "demons,"" and it does this in a whimsical tone, making for something  of an impUcit gender joke. The explanation inadvertently underlines the  mortality and therefore embodiedness of women whUe it assuages—  and this is the fronic impUcation at hand—the putative Roman reader's  "fear of the power of evU" at a time when, any good patristic dogmatist  would think, fear should be nourished, as it would be by demons." In  all, the brief tieatment of gendered personification makes for a cropped  analysis on KatzeneUenbogen's part whUe it rehearses the same  triviaUzation of women coimnon to much antifeminine thinking. This  triviaUzation seems an echo of the demonization of women that did  " Adolf KatzeneUenbogen, Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Mediaeval Art (London:  The Warburg Instihite, 1939; rep. New York: W. W. Norton and Co., 1964) p. 1.  The most cogent argument that Prudentius' allegorical agents are literary  representations of residual, pre-Christian deities or demons drawn from Roman and  Etruscan worship is Kenneth R. Haworth, Deified Virtues, Demonic Vices, and Descriptive  Allegory in the "Psychomachia" of Prudentius (Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert, 1980).  " Hannes Vatter, The Devil in English Literature (Bem: Francke Veriag, 1978) p. 44  reviews the demonological commonplace concerning the affective, positive value of  demons to "scare straight" early medieval Christians.  </page> <page sequence="11"> Personification's Gender 159  come to dominate some patristic thinking about gender which this essay  wiU take up shortly.  More positive and popular was the creativity (or procreativity)  theory of female personification. FuUy articulated by Joan Ferrante in  her influential book Woman as Image in the Middle Ages, this second  theory explains that the neo-Platonic cosmic aUegory of Martianus' De  nuptiis, Alan's De planctu Naturae, or Bemardus' Cosmographia itself  demands narratives centered on universal genesis, divine creativity,  emanation, marriage, parturition, and nurturing or nursing. Neo- Platonic generativity could be enabled by nothing other than  personified women, embodiments of maternity." But the explanation  does not really find a necessary or fixed cormection between the bodies  of early personification characters and narrative themes which occupy  them because male figures need not be excluded in an aUegorical social  world of cosmic birthroom and nursery; that Mercury (a male god  merely interpreted as "Eloquence") must marry PhUology bespeaks the  dual-sex ontology of Platonic cosmic emanation. Something more  logicaUy necessary, elementary, and rigorous had to be found to  conned the feminine to the embodiments of personification aUegory.  Hence the necessity for a formalist theory of gendered  personification. In addition to her thematic model of neo-Platonic  procreativity, Ferrante also subscribed to the third and by far most  widely held view on the origins or causes of female gendered  personification. This is the view that most people who have paused to  consider gendered personification adopt automatically and tiien insist  on, and it predicates a necessary and logical cormection between the  bodied gender of personifications and thefr thematic or social quaUties:  because most Latin or Greek abstract nouns are in the feminine gender,  abstract concepts take on correspondingly female bodies in a poetic  narrative. So when male personifications do begin to appear in  medieval aUegory, they can be attiibuted to the decay of rigid gender  structure in the European vernaculars by the end of the ffrst  miUermium. Here is a simple, rigid, correspondential formulation; it is  rigorous, intuitively sound, logical. Grammar determines the rhetorical  structures subtending aUegorical iconography and narrative.  Nor is the theory by any means new. According to Helen Cooper,  the argument was probably first put forward in a commentary on  " Joan Ferrante, Woman as Image in the Middle Ages: From the Twelfth Century to Dante  (New York: Columbia University Press, 1975) pp. 37-64.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 160 RHETORICA  Boethius' Consolatio once attributed by Edmund SUk to an anonymous  writer of the ninth century." The anonymous commentator claimed that  since the noun philosophia was feminine in Greek and Latin, the  character Lady PhUosophy had to be a woman. As far as one can teU,  this sensible tiieory must have achieved automatic approval tiiroughout  the Middle Ages because important rhetorical and poetical theorists,  such as Geoffrey of Vinsauf, didn't comment directly on personification  in terms of gender (altiiough many, induding Geoffrey, did foUow the  Rhetorica ad Herennium by automatically using a personified female urbs  or rmtio as the prime exemplum of prosopopeia). As late as the eighteenth  century, Joseph Addison (who probably wouldn't have knovwi the  medieval provenance of this theory at aU but who would have known  the Greek and Latin rhetoricians and thefr favorite exempla) reflected the  logical tone of Neoclassical poetics when he drew the same conclusion  regarding early visual personifications, always cast as women, in an  essay on Roman medals.'" Much of twentieth-century historical  iconography has foUowed the lead too. E. H. Gombrich offered the  same grammatical line of reasoning regarding ancient or Renaissance  art and ornament: "Abstract nouns in Greek and Latin almost regularly  take on the feminine gender and so the way is open for the world of  ideas being peopled by personified abstiactions such as Victoria,  Forturm, or lusticia."^^ In her excellent book on feminist theory of  aUegory, Maureen QuiUigan, one of the stiongest contiibutors to such  theorization, also adheres to this same grammatical or phUological  rationale, although she gives the formulation a more compUcated spin  (whUe following, consciously or unconsciously, the cadence of  Gombrich's assertion, as the tell-tale "and so" indicates):  [Pjersonifications of abstractions such as Philosophy and Nature take the  feminine form primarily because allegory always works narratively by  literalizing lexical effects. The gender of abstract nouns made from verbs in  Latin is always feminine—auctoritas itself, for instance, is feminine—and so  " Helen Cooper, "Gender and Personification in Piers Plowman," The Yearbook of  Langland Studies 5 (1991) p. 31.

Here, "lexical effects" (a timely Barthesian term) serve as the stiuctural  buUding blocks of "aUegory," whUe grammar, part of the controlUng  armature of lexical effects, stays in service too, keeping the  correspondentialist relation intact. And Cooper's study on the subject,  "Gender and Personification in Piers Plowman," indeed endorses the  grammatical view put forth by the Boethian commentator (who serves  as opening epigram to her article) regarding most gendered  personification in Latin, continental, and Middle EngUsh writings untU  the late Middle Ages when the tiaditional restiaints of grammar- character correspondence feU away (especially in Middle EngUsh texts  such as Piers Plowman)."  To simplify things, we might wish to regroup the three theories I've  summarized into two, more serviceable categories: KatzeneUenbogen's  theory negativizes women (they are morally fallen and mortal) whUe  the procreativity theory idealizes or deifies them (women are the  vehicles of cosmic and sacred generativity). Both KatzeneUenbogen and  Ferrante have charted two poles of the same essentializing imperative in  ancient and medieval gender consciousness. This binarization calls up  both Howard Bloch's model of medieval misogyny—that is, the  essentializing of women as either negative or positive, demonic or deific,  destructive or creative, chaotic or unifying—as weU as feminism's  narrative of the origins of binarity itself.'* Consequently, the third  theory of personification's gender—the theory of grammatical-ontic  " Maureen QuiUigan, The Allegory of Female Authority: Christine de Pizan's "Citi des  Dames" (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991) pp. 24-25.  See Cooper, p. 23, who also argues that Piers Plowman's irregular personificational  procedures—that is, the creation of a preponderance of male personified abstractions—  reveal Langland's careful homage to medieval rhetorical tradition as seen in the writings of  Coru-ad of Hirsau. Cooper argues that Langland employs the notion of metonymy rather  than prosopopeia per se, maintaining logical consistency between the human template  "container" (the protagonist named Will) producing its allegorical dreams and the  projected or subordinate abstract components or "contents" existing therein (pp. 42-43). In  short. Cooper's formulation, although convincing and important, amounts to another  version of ontological consistency or correspondentialism ("if male consciousness, then  male components") of the sort I describe below.

Even Otto Jespersen grew exasperated trying to work out why  abstract nouns in the Indo-European languages always took the  feminine gender; tiiat universal concepts Uke "earth" (terra or tellus, gaia  or Chora) could have been seen as life-giving or nurturing was logical,  though the formalization of the prehistoric relationship between  grammatical gender and biological sex proved chaotic as weU as  antithetical to the precepts of an historical linguistics.''

This neglect—perhaps prompted by logic's anxiety over the  para-logical—in tum signifies the powerful cultural oppositions  grammar/rhetoric or logic/rhetoric as de Man had defined them. De  Man's Grammar and Logic always seek to wage war on Rhetoric and  her slippery tropes; the tiampUng under foot of Rhetoric thus threatens  to disempower her and to destroy the dichotomy grammar/rhetoric  itself, leaving only Grammar. This looks Uke the reinstaUation of a  cognitive hierarchy with a vengeance: Grammar over Rhetoric, the  latter defeated and perhaps destroyed.

Such is the inevitable de Manian resolution in the formalization of  rhetorical tropes: rhetoric resists grammar; rhetorical readings,  according to deconstruction, displace whUe they give oppositional  identity to grammar's systematicity."  But just as Grammar undoes her own hierarchy in an institutional,  semiotic gigantomachia, so Gender loses her primacy as a logicaUy  warranted, ontologically privileged category organizing the rhetorical  tropes that are embedded in or bound up with personification. Either as  components of a Uterary text or in theoretical isolation, tropes do not  operate in discrete compartments; they exist as subordinates, variants,  mirror versions, or differentials of each other; like grammar and  rhetoric they are not always discrete and separable, even though we  may desfre tiiem to be so out of convenience.'* In the matter at hand, the  foundational logic of grammar-identity in gendered personification  represses but thereby invokes what is laiown in early modem rhetoric  as anthimeria, the figure whereby one can deform correct syntax or  grammar in order to produce a solecism or creative "error."  Anthimeria, Uke its Renaissance synonym enaUage, might involve  switching conventionaUy determined parts of speedi in a sentence or  cases of nominative number; it might mean making nouns into verbs (a  common feature of English) or misusing pronouns (as in h)^ochorism—  an irmocent-looking figure that is really imbricated in an array of figural  " Deconstruction may be defined as the systematic dismcmtling or inversion of the  cogiutive dualities Uteral/figurative, logical/rhetorical, grammar/rhetoric, proper/  figurative. Paul de Man's primer text that covers the fates of these programmatic pairs is  still "Semiology and Rhetoric"; see Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau,  Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1979) pp. 3-19.  See too de Man's opening essay in The Resistance to Theory, pp. 3-20, for his famous pitting of  grammar against rhetoric in the arena of contemporary critical production and its social  responsibilities.  " The pragmatic interchangeability of tropes and figures first appears in QuintiUan  (see Institutes 6.2, 6.3 and 9.2), although it most strongly characterizes the enterprises of the  late neo-classical rhetoricians (see Pierre Fontanier, Les figures du Discours, intro. Gerard  Genette (Paris: Flammarion, 1968]) and their successors, the modem stmctural rhetoricians  (see Jean Dubois et al. eds, A General Rhetoric, trans. Paul B. BureU and Edgar Slotkin  [Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981]).  </page> <page sequence="16"> 164 RHETORICA  differentials)." Above aU, tiie figure antiiimeria can mean inverting  grammatical gender—agam, by misusing pronouns as in hypochorism  or by misapplying gender-designate general nouns (a gay man can be a  "she"; a group of women can be referred to as "guys"). The figure thus  subverts or inverts tiie ontological consistency of sex or granunatical  gender just as personification subverts the consistency of corporeal  presence, Ufe, or human status. That is to say, personification afready  involves the radical suspension of fixed ontic categories such as  bodUy/abstiact, human/non-human or Uving/non-living. The  alogicaUty that diffuses or disseminates tiirough personification's  ontological suspension also diffuses through anthimeria, the figure that  involves the radical suspension of another set of fixed ontic values—  female/male. As Derrida would have it, the disseminative energy of  trope subverts whUe it enables the taxonomic impulse behind tiope  theory, behind or inside the "general taxonomy of metaphors,"  revealing not taxonomic closure but the play of a vast "phUosopheme."*"  Put yet another way, every personification, which inverts the  configurations human/non-human, Uving/non-living, substantial/  insubstantial, is haunted by an anthimeria that by definition can invert  female/male. It might be said that anthimeria wears the mask or face of  prosopopeia; prosopopeia or personification speaks itself as anthimeria.  Like personification, anthimeria might therefore be thought of as that  tiope which asserts the independence or aUenation of aU tropology from  the discursive domain of logic and grammar. It is the trope of tioping,  where froping is defined as linguistic self-alienation from grammar.  Tropes such as personification and anthimeria are already mutual  figures for the potential dismantling of foundational oppositions and of  ontological consistencies in phUosophical systems. They are things that  subvert as well as enable logic or logos.  " Hypochorism, the trope of pet-naming, can involve the whimsical referring to a  human person by using the pronoun "it" rather than "he" or "she". Couched also as a  diminutio or tapinosis, such a pronominal hypochorism simultaneously instaUs a pragmapeia  or reification, the trope of depersonalization which stands as the structural opposite to  prosopopeia or anthropomorphism.

WOMEN AS FIGURES OF FIGURATION  We therefore need to propose a different set of correspondences based  not on grammar but on the associative or performative  macrometaphors of rhetoric itself in order more effectively to cormect  femininity and key tropes Uke personification. The foUowing three  premises inscribe an alternative conceptual genealogy of  personification's gender:  (1) In much classical rhetorical theory and, more importantly, in one  influential strand of patristic thought, women are semiotically  "interchangeable" with rhetorical tropes; that is, they are the figures of  figuration.  (2) According to the discursive metaphorics of rhetoric and poetics,  personification or prosopopeia stands as the figure of figuration, the  tiope of troping.  (3) Through axiomatic identity, personification and women serve as  reciprocal concepts or images.  Premise one: some of the ideological motivation for the fact that  tiopes were associated with women finds direct expression in the rather  uniform corpus of classical rhetorical theory. Early on, rhetoric in the  Aristotelian tiadition centered on the "means-end" process. It sought  the inventive means for discovering arguments towards the end of  achieving persuasion. But this condition began to change in Roman  rhetoric towards the end of the RepubUc. In emphasizing rhetoric as the  account of deformations or tiansformations in persuasive language,  Roman rhetoric often overshadowed the enth3mieme and the topic with  the figure or the trope as the focal unit of theoretical interest. Later  classical rhetoric foUowed the inventory impulse begun in Demetrius or  the Rhetorica ad Herennium; and concomitant to this impulse, persuasive  speech or writing and the rhetorical figures they employed conformed  to a container/content or outside/inside image, the image of the  deformation, the deviation.*'  This process was fuUy under way by the time of QuintiUan.  Rhetoric involved masking, concealing, or translating. This self- ascription, it is now widely beUeved, not only helped tum rhetoric into  a massive inventory of tropes and figures (an historical process that  " Tzvetan Todorov, Theories of the Symbol, trans.

Although tiie  discourse of oratory existed as a masculine enterprise par excellence (one  complementary to society's martial arts), tropes and figures more and  more became sheer "omaments" m a "cosmetic" economy of verbal  production, as Tzvetan Todorov has nicely summarized." For  CJuintiUan, the analogy of such unbridled and "monstious"  ornamentation was the effeminate man who would depUate his body  and use makeup:  Nam sermo rectus et secundum naturam enuntiatus nihil habere ex ingenio  videtur; ilia vero, quae utcunque deflexa sunt, tanguam exquisitiora  miramur; non aliter quam distortis et quocunque modo prodigiosis  corporibus apud quosdam maius est pretium quam iis, quae nihil ex  communi habitu boni perdiderunt. Atque etiam qui specie capiuntur,  vulsis levatisque et inustas comas acu comentibus et non suo colore nitidis  plus esse formae putant, quam possit tribuere incorrupta natura, ut  pulchritudo corporis venire videatur ex malis morum.  For we have come to regard direct and natural speech as incompatible with  genius, while all that is in any way abnormal is admired as exquisite.  Similarly we see that some people place a higher value on figures which  are in any way monstrous or distorted than they do on those who have not  lost any of the advantages of the normal form of man. There are even some  who are captivated by the shams of artifice and think that there is more  beauty in those who pluck out superfluous hair or use depilatories, who  dress their locks by scorching them with the curling iron and glow with a  complexion that is not their own, than can ever be conferred by nature  " See respectively Richard McKeon, "Rhetoric in the Middle Ages", Critics and  Criticism, ed.

As Todorov concludes, QuintiUan had worked to promote the already  growing idea that figura was "body," as the Latin term's own lexical  constitution indicates and as QuintiUan's customary exchange of the  technical term schema for figura in the Institutes suggests." And as the  passage from the Institutes demonstrates, (QuintiUan's anxiety over his  contemporaries' admiration for figures—or bodies {corporibus)—that  were "abnormal," "monstrous" and "distorted" {deflexa, prodigiosis,  distortis) was bound up with effeminate speech and behavior; it was an  anxiety that turned on the degree figural expression had departed  "from the advantages of the normal form of man" {ex communi habitu  boni).  The leap in Roman thinking to the idea that figures were dressed up  or painted bodies, and in particular effeminate bodies, seemed  established. Rhetoric therefore had to struggle to assert its hegemony as  a masculine enterprise, as QuintiUan's jeremiad makes clear. Rhetoric,  as Maud Gleason argues, found itself divided by a line partitioning a  positive, mascuUne, energetic, honest, and ascetic cultural practice from  a negative, feminine, languorous, deceptive, and indulgent one." The  femininity of rhetoric and its potentially deceptive tropes haunts the  history of linguistic representation weU beyond the age of (2uintiUan or  of the Second Sophistic. It is also worth noting in this context that  prosopopeia had itself become suspect in some cfrcumstances, as  Gleason's fascinating narrative of Favorinus, master prosopo-poet,  suggests: the famed second-century rhetor, loiown for his effeminacy  and deviant comportment, conducted, as the most famous single legal  defense in his career, an extended prosopopeia on behaU of his own  pubUc statue!*'  Institutio oratoria, 2.5.11-12.

"Ibid., pp. 3-20.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 168 RHETORICA  The semiotic forces at work in rhetoric and femininity emerged  more fuUy blown among certam patristic writers of early Christianity.  To be sure, the most influential fatiiers were steeped in tiie rhetorical  tradition of Rome; Augustine's imagination, it has been said, was  aUnost entfrely a product of the systematic study of the Latm classics.*'  Even more so, TertulUan outclassed aU of tiie fathers on the subjed of  classical Uterature, rhetoric, skUl in latinity, natural history, and even  medicine, making him one of the most formidable experts on poetry  and in juridical presentation.*'  The characteristic linking of the feminine and rhetorical figuration  thus persisted through the strong influence of such key persons.  Women were not just associated with rhetorical ornamentation,  seduction, or excess; it could be said that they were conceived as figures  or tropes themselves. This state of affafrs depended partly upon the  figural mythology of the making of woman in Genesis (2:20-23), for the  literal impossibility of woman as an entity "taken out of man" caused a  hermeneutical problem for certain of the Latin fathers who had frouble  admitting such an actual, physical event. The creation process could  thus be seen as somewhat metaphorical; indeed it could be thought of  as the weUspring of the metaphorical in human cognition and  expression, with the creation of Eve signifying the ffrst loss of  literalness, dfrectness. As Bloch summarizes:  Since the creation of woman is synonymous with the creation of metaphor,  the relation between Adam and Eve is the relation of the proper to the  figural, which implied a derivation, deflection, denaturing, a tropological  turning away. The perversity of Eve, as it is imagined in the early centuries  of the Christian era, is that of the lateral: as the outgrowth of Adam's flank,  his latus, she retains the status of translatio, of translation, transfer,  metaphor, trope. She is side issue.TM  Eve, in certain influential patristic texts, stood as "the figure for the  figural," the trope of troping. Since such a conceptual dynamic begins in  the physical imaging of bodies (Eve's extraction from Adam's latus), the  reciprocal imaging oi figurae (which means both rhetorical devices as  " Peter Brown, Augustine of Hippo: A Biography (Berkeley: University of California  Press, 1967) pp. 35-39.  *' Timothy David Bames, Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study (Oxford: Clarendon  Press, 1971) pp. 187-210.

Even a less negative exegesis of the latus account—^namely  Bede's important tj^ological intervention. In Genesim—could still  interpret Eve as a female corporate body, the personified church  (ecclesia), which had come out of the figural body of Christ."  In addition to the aUegorical myth of the latus/translatus  configuration, a subsequent moment from Genesis (3:1-6) also  characterizes Eve as another kind of self-reflexive image for trope, an  emblem of the inside/outside dichotomy. TertulUan's De cultu  femirmrum ("On Women's Get-Up," as it might be put in coUoquial  American) contains an assault on the Imperial woman's customary  attachment to cosmetics (right down to the health dangers of using  hafrdye) and fancy clothes. The document starts off with a memorably  harsh account of Eve's status as prime motivator of worldly evil. The  invective (which shows TertulUan at his most rhetoricaUy acute in firing  up one of QuintiUan's most potent juridical tropes, tiie apostiophe)  casts aU women in the figural guise of Eve the seducer, making them  guUty of the faU from paradise and deserving of thefr subordinate social  status. Motivated as further commentary on Genesis 2 and 3, the  passage hinges on key terms that thematize the structure of the  cosmetic, the omamental, the figural:  In doloribus et anxietatibus paris, mulier, et ad uirum tuum conuersio tua,  et ille dominatur tui: et Euam te esse nescis?

The excerpt begins with a citation from Genesis 3:16 before moving next  to a shocking rhetorical question and a double personification of "God's  sentence" (sententia dei) and "guUt" (reatus). But tiie passage seems to  hinge on the point-blank assertion that Eve was the ffrst rhetorician—  UteraUy, the first "to persuade" another human being {quae eum suasisti);  so one might take the point to be a metastatement about rhetoric made  in a rhetoricaUy overglazed invective, although the matter marks orUy  the minimal effects of the passage.  Among the stages of TertulUan's elaborate anaphora, or rather  epizeuxis (the dogged repetition of a word or term in elegy or  invective), Eve/Woman finds depiction as the devU's (diaboli) proxy  since she is his means for seducing humanity. More precisely, TertuUian  describes Eve as a "threshold" (janua, a term more tiaditionaUy  tianslated as "gateway")." This turns out to be a tacit way of signifying  the limen or margin of that which is inside and that which is outside;  janua means the very idea of insides versus outsides. Like Janus Bifrons,  the old Roman genius of the threshold who faces two opposite ways.  Eve serves as a kind of embodiment or personification of the idea of  containment, of that which is margined and marginating. One might  also hear an echo of this idea in the very personification of feminized  lust itself: the Psychomachia's Sodomita Libido bears, among other  epithets throwm on her by Pudicitia, the title ianua leti, "threshold of  destmction" (1. 89).  TertulUan's strange personification of the threshold, however,  engages a vexing aporia: Eve, it could be said, "faces" outward  (towards the devU's incursio) and inward (towards Adam in paradise).

Yet  she also faces inward (towards the devil whom she masks but releases  out into the world) and outward (towards Adam and his doomed  progeny). TertuUian is as skUled in verbal overloading (choosing the  centiifugal term janua) as he is in disposition or amplification through  tiope selection.  The compUcated semiotic of this anaphoric tiain continues: as  "opener" {resigtwtrix) of "that Tree" (arboris illius, which functions as a  synecdoche for the opened or eaten fruit), she is furthermore  metaphorized as the agent of tiansgressed margins or of locked  containers and thefr contents.

Violator as weU as genius/ia of margins. Eve's function as the devil's  proxy or mouthpiece likewise marks her as his prosopon—that is, his  mask or face—in facing outward and speaking to Adam. In the last line  of the section I have quoted above pelliceas is a pun, meaning both poor  quaUty garments and skin. The configuration further highUghts the  prosopon image of laminated exteriors that hide more than one interior.'*  That these skins would want for a superseding outer layer brings the  passage to a pitch, engaging a sarcasmus. TertulUan's invective both  reinforces and reflects women's semiotic status in much ancient and  early medieval representation. Woman has been forced to serve as the  climactic emblem of figural or semiotic proxy; she had become the  figure for figure.  Readers today do not need to be persuaded that TertulUan's  misogynistic pronouncements in De cultu feminarum either reek with  self-righteousness or reveal a rhetorical juggernaut on stage, a clever  jurist manque who knew and loved his QuintiUan. But the whole  conceptual scheme glimpsed in the rhetoric of the passage I've cited  suffers as weU from a kind of processual and cognitive error or  misprision: the interchangeabUity of the feminine with trope amounts to  a grafting of meta-rhetorical, performative language about cosmetics  and concealment onto those individuals who personally and by  common cultural practice might indulge in cosmetic self-embellishment.

It is always already constituted  according to the imaginary features of concealment, clothing, cosmetics,  facades, and so fortii. These descriptive concepts hinge on the stmctural  oppositions of insides/outsides, substrates/surfaces, unseen/seen,  content/form, primary/secondary. Prosopopeia or personification is  the semiotically or rhetoricaUy self-reflexive trope par exceUence in that  its own lexical nature bespeaks a duaUty of insides and outsides: the  HeUenic term prosopon poein means "to make a face or mask"; persona  too means not only "person" but "mask." Such masking or covering,  post-classical rhetoric and poetics have held, is how aU figural images  exist in relation to the literal or the proper."  So if one wanted to personify the concept personification, one  would have to produce a fictional but material body that afready  thematized the idea of a secret inside and a seU-advertising outside, an  outside that hawks its exteriority—a feat achieved through cosmetic  embellishment, social deceptiveness, and marked penefrabiUty. We are  faced with the third of those premises: it seems inevitable that actual  personifications in narrative were forced to adopt female bodies. The  logic here seems axiomatic but is merely associational: if woman is the  figure of figure, and personification is the figure of figure, then woman  and personification share ontological identity. Real women in the  patiiarchal world of early medieval Europe were in many cases treated  something like personified agents—that is, they might be described, in  the sort of argument Bloch has put forth, as having been "Ufted out of  history" in that they were often deprived of significant social power and  *' See Jon Whitman, Allegory: The Dynamics of an Ancient and Medieval Technique  (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1987) p. 269, for a semantic or lexical  discussion of prosopopeia's semiotic implications in early philosophical discourse and for  its connection to allegoria or, as it was known in Hellenic thought, hyponoia ("under sense").  See also Paxson, pp. 39-40, for discussion of the binary structure of the prosopopeia or  personification figure; and Carolyn Dinshaw, Chaucer's Sexual Poetics (Madison: The  University of Wisconsin Press, 1989) pp. 20-21, passim, for the medieval connection between  the figure aUegory and the programmatic imagery of clothed bodies, undressing, seduction,  and penetration.  </page> <page sequence="25"> Personification's Gender 173  suitable ontological status by men." But more to the point for my  argument, textual and fictional personifications had to mime the ontic  forms of actual women.  Although this essay has in part set out to free up rhetoric and  tiopology from logic's control, I must qualify the logical consistency in  this conclusion too. The three premises I Usted earUer and have taken  some time to trace struggle to constitute a syllogism: if woman is the  figure of figure, and personification is the figure of figure, then  personification is ontologically identical to woman. This syUogism  reveals an undistributed middle term: there could be two or more  "figures of figuration" existing separately and distinctly from each  other." The final premise therefore marks a big leap in associational  para-logic, the "logic" of rhetorical tioping. Or, we could say that the  governing enthymemes, or syUogised topics, that characterize such  large associative formations in cultural semiotics demonstrate how even  Aristotelian rhetoric and dialectic impel proofs that are "equipped with  quasi-logical tools.""  However, the "rhetoric" I speak of at this moment is reaUy the  meta-rhetoric of pubUc or institutional discourse—the performative and  circumscribing discursive armature that names the contained matters  under study, which are tiopology and male attitudes about women in  the Middle Ages. The associational para-logic or quasi-logic whereby  poets and rhetoricians might have conflated women and personification  carries no more vaUdity, i. e. no more formal warrant, than the para- logic of magical contagion or homeopathy—the same brand of para- logic that underwrites the old grammar-identity argument in the first  place. But such is indeed the constitutive though diffusive or  disseminational quaUty of rhetorical or tropological ontology (as I've  " Bloch, p. 5. We must tiear in mind influential historiographic alternatives to Bloch's  model of misogyny: see Peter Brown, The Body and Society: Men, Women and Sexual  Renunciation in Early Christianity (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988) esp. chapters  13 and 14, pp. 259-304; and Jo Ann McNamara, A New Song: Celibate Women in the First Three  Christian Centuries (New York; Haworth Press, 1983).  " Anthimeria, for instance, could be thought of as a "figure for figuration," as I've  argued above; so could catachresis (see note 22) or even metalepsis, which, because it eUdes  or coUapses the individual steps in a complicated figurative image or conceit, lays bare  figuration's cognitive structure in the first place. See Quintilian, Institutio oratoria, 8.6.37-39.  " Renato Barilli, Rhetoric, trans.

Consequentiy, it becomes evident tiiat tiie "axiomatic' identity  impUed in tiie tiifrd premise involves tiie projection of tiie tiieoretical  and descriptive vocabulary attached to tiie whole of rhetoric as a  discipline or institution down to a subset or component of rhetoric—  that is, down to the trope personification in this case. This amounts to  another instance of the "cognitive misprision" I mentioned earUer—the  one whereby certain patristic and medieval thinkers condensed a whole  social practice (cosmetic indulgence) down onto the actual onto- physiccd constitutions of members of the class associated with that  practice (individual women). One might just as weU wish to think of the  misprision as synecdochic, for it involves the processual conflation of a  part for a whole, just as Eve, who was already a synecdoche for female  humanity, often served, cum janua diaboli, as a synecdoche for the idea  of UminaUty in quarters of the patristic hermeneutical setting.  And this misprision, as it reveals how the meta-level rhetoric or  performative and institutional meta-metaphorics of rhetorical theory  contaminates and fransforms purportedly isolated and abstracted  figures and tiopes themselves, involves other figural differentials, other  variant tropes beyond synecdoche. Regarding gendered personification,  the adjunct trope simile, which had always been used to talk about  tioping in general, gets literalized and consequently grafted onto the  imaginary phenomenal or "material" nature of one individual tiope,  personification. This yields a programmatic metaphor: the discursive or  performative simUe "figuration is like a woman" undergoes  tiansformation into the metaphor "one figure, personification, is a  woman." Even before the aUegorical poet composes a narrative, the  ready-made device personification is already "metapersonified" as a  woman," and consequent actantial agents in actual aUegorical  narratives adopt the same phenomenological or physical character.  " See Paxson, pp. 161-63, on metapersonification, a narratorial process that involves  the mimetic imaging of prosopopeia's semiotic structure in a narrative. J. Hillis Miller calls  this self-reflexive mimetic effect "paraprosopopeia": see his Versions of Pygmalion  (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990) p. 228. I add that the detour through  simile and metaphor at this moment will demand, in my subsequent work on the issue,  accommodation of the Lacanian theory of rhetorical copula central to a semiotics of simile  and metaphor. I thank Shirley Sharon-Zisser for this revelation and for the productive  direction it enables in my own theory of gender and rhetorical troping.  </page> <page sequence="27"> Personification's Gender 175  Individual personifications are women because Personification is a  woman.  Although I earUer mentioned in passing that Geoffrey of Vinsauf (as  an exemplary rhetorical theorist of the High Middle Ages) wouldn't  have bothered in his discussion of prosopopeia to give a dfrect  explanation for the fact that aUegorical personifications were women, he  does make the significant move of giving as his prime exemplum the  impassioned complaint {corujuestus) of TeUus along with the complaint  of Roma, the latter's hafr unkempt {sparsis sic Roma capillis). But more  important, Geoffrey insistently personifies prosopopeia, the fifth of his  eight tropes of amplification, as a woman. Geoffrey's own discursive  rhetoric carmot be denied: he indicates that each of the first three  tiopes—repetition, periphrasis, and comparison—is a "step" (gradus)  towards amplification; tiie next trope listed, apostrophe, is the "fourth  [means] of delay" (quarta morarum). But the fifth trope, prosopopeia,  arrives fully personified itself, not as a fifth "method" or "step" but as a  female "co-assistant" or "helpmeet" (quinta coadjutrix) at the poet's  side." Personification here becomes something of a classical Muse,  though the expression answers, no doubt, the language of Genesis.  Geoffrey's Personification stands typologically as another Eve; she is the  helpmeet or helpmate proposed by God for Adam shortly after the  man's creation (Gen. 2:18): "faciamus ei adiutorium similem sui." The Eve  of Tertullian and the Eve of Bede find not just an antitype but a semiotic  analog in Geoffrey's Lady Personification.  My basic claim—that the female entity Personification determines  the femaleness of the many personifications in medieval aUegory—  posits an active stiucturalist armature at the core of historically early,  genderized personification. In other words, the hidden and, as it were,  unconscious configurations of rhetoric's deep structure find  deployment in the surface-stiucture manifestations of aUegorical  characterization and in sporadic, occulted sites among the corpus of  rhetorical theory. Nevertheless, this is not to privilege a stiuctural  poetics of gender and tropology; rather, the structural system of  *" Poetria Nova, 3.A, 11. 461-66: "Quinta coadjutrix, ultra protendere cursum, /  Prosopopeia, veni. Cui nulla potentia fandi, / Da licite fari donetque licentia linguam. / Sic  Phetonteos teUus experta vapores / Est conquesta Jovi; sparsis sic Roma capillis / Caesaris  instrepuit lacrimosa voce sopori"; Faral, n. 11 above, p. 211.

As I should have said  earlier, this essay does not reject out of hand the grammar-identity  argument; rather, it proposes a rhetorical, semiological, and ideological  model that can be seen to coextend with or complement grammatical  identity. My argument also predicates isomorphic consistency between  deep and surface structures, between ideological reservoir and text,  with the two domains reinforcing each other mutuaUy." But aU  arguments treating correspondentialist, essentialized gender semiotics  inescapably faU upon the discursive limits of sex and language, to  paraphrase Butler.  So these tiansformations inflect everything in the sphere of rhetoric  and poetics from performative meta-language down through Uterary  theme. Thus, a variant of the misogynistic designation that woman is  trope appears in the predominant medieval topos of "the talkative  woman" which I wish to touch upon now only in summary. For  Howard Bloch, it too furnishes much of the substance used in anti- matiimonial writings, romances, allegories, and troubadour lyrics." The  idea of woman as riot, chaos, and uncontrolled speech might be taken  as a humorous, UteraUzed manifestation of prosopopeia's lexical  character, as something of a vast sexist joke. After all, prosopopeia  involves making not only artificial humanoid agents out of abstiactions,  but the insistent making of speakers. The more potent figural  embodiment of figured speech would thus be the gender in whom the  power and practice of talking is presumed to exist more strongly:  talkative women would become the signs of prosopopeia by default.  Then again, the lexical and semiotic forces at work in gendered  prosopopeia could have helped fumish some patristic and medieval  " Butler, n. 22 above, pp. 27-31.  " That is, the meta-rhetoric of the disciplines we call rhetoric and poetics helped shape  the formation of the woman-as-trope topos in allegorical texts. But it's likely that the  literary texts themselves in tum served as agents in remodeling consequent rhetorical (or  theological and philosophical) knowledge about women in medieval Christian culture.  "See Bloch, pp. 14-17.  </page> <page sequence="29"> Personification's Gender 177  thinkers with the impression that women were frrepressible talkers and  therefore also the actual embodiments of speech's "science"—rhetoric  and its tropes. I find it no coincidence that four out of six among  Prudentius' talkative, boastful Vices meet thefr bloody ends through  catastrophic wounds inflicted (by the hands of corresponding Virtues)  on thefr organs of speech. We see tongues slashed or pierced, throats  crushed, and teeth unrooted. Witness the most graphic of such  descriptions when Luxuria ("Indulgence") falls to Sobrietas:  casus agit saxum, medii spiramen ut oris frangeret, et recavo misceret labra  palato. dentibus introrsum resolutis lingua resectam dilaniata gulam frustis  cum sanguinis inplet.  Chance drives the stone [hurled by Sobriety] to smash [Indulgence's]  breath-passage in the midst of the face and beat the lips into the arched  mouth. The teeth within are loosened, the gullet cut, and the mangled  tongue fills it with bloody fragments. (11.421-26)  Although I once took these bizarrely emphasized and repetitive  demolitions to stand as the seU-reflexive sign for prosopopeia itself—  that is, the sign for the trope's UteraUzed inverse (the "M«-making of  face" or speech)'*—I must now affirm that such self-reflexive semiosis  functions best only when we recognize that it's the femaleness of the  Psychomachia's talkative, aUegorical entities that overdetermines the  kind of injury—^hyperUteralized oral sUencing—most of the Vices  undergo. WeU after Ovid's Philomela has her tongue cut out by Tereus  and long before Shakespeare's Lavinia suffers exUnguation at the hands  of her rapists Chiron and Demetrius in Titus Andronicus, Prudentius has  silenced his female characters in the service of constructing a  relentlessly misogynistic aUegory of female ontology and tiopological  character invention.  In summary, a plausible genealogy of these discursive  tiansformations might run as follows: (1) both grammar-identity and  semiotic deep-structure transference yield at the level of Uterary or  " Paxson, pp. 67-69. The Vices who suffer from demolished mouths or cmshed and  pierced throats at the hands of their slayers include Paganism (11. 33-35), Lust (49-51),  Indulgence (421-26), and Greed (590-93). Pride has her head severed while facing, in  prostrate posture, her slayers Patience and Humility who decapitate the Vice with a sword  blow aimed at the throat (282-83). Wrath of course commits suicide (by throwing herself on  her spear) after her assaults have no effect on Patience (153-54).  </page> <page sequence="30"> ^78 RHETORICA  textual production a worid of female personified characters; (2) tiiese  active and talkative characters advertise to readers tiie loquacious  effects of characterization achieved tiirough the radical tiope  prosopopeia; (3) tiiese innately talkative female prosopopeias provide  part of the subsequent template to domestic Christian culture in the  early Middle Ages. Helping along tiie whole process are tiie widely  imitated rhetorical topoi (as in Geoffrey's Poetria Nova) that managed to  realize these transformations in thefr own discourses and to incorporate  typological forces played out suice the writings of some of the earUest  Latin fathers. Real women, likewise "made" by a divine artificer, were  taken as too talkative and thus exemplary of the human power of  speech in general and of poetically invented, fropologicaUy designated  speech in particular. Above all, this bidirectional or osdUatory model  underlines the operation of these rhetorical and ideological formations  in history, a history shaped by a cumulative sequence of dialogicaUy  engaged agents including the Genesis redactor, Demetiius, the Rhetorica  ad Herennium author, TertulUan, Geoffrey of Vinsauf, and others. It  supplements and rectifies the potential ahistoricaUty of the structural  apparatus that I have so far employed in this discussion and that 1 have  drav^m out of de Manian rhetorical analysis.  The pinning down of the precise historical forces that prompted the  de-feminizing of personifications by the twelfth century, however, is the  subject of another study. Nevertheless de Manian tactics remain viable  for pre-modem narrative personification. Although de Man himself has  suffered suppression in recent theory—the profracted effect of the  scandal surrounding his Wartime Journalism"—certain of his  deconstructive tactics can shed needed Ught on problems hitherto  unfinished in his ambitious intellectual program. In other words, the  semiotics of aUegorical gender can stiU be best articulated using vintage  deconstructive tactics. The fact that personification is gendered might in  fact provide the most saUent, positive, and timely response to de Man's  program in our current era of post-theory.  Furthermore, the discursive and institutional structure of gendered  personification, particularly in medieval Uterature and culture, turns  out to provide a test case for showing how a long-accepted and  " See Paul de Man, Wartime Journalism, 1939-1943, ed.
