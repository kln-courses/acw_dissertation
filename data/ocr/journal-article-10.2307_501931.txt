During his lifetime, the editors were de- voted to him as their teacher and friend. Helga von Heintze, who has worked on all three volumes, was his assistant while he was president of the German Archaeological Institute at Rome. Peter von Blanckenhagen called himself a pupil of Kaschnitz although he already had his Ph.D. when he came to Marburg and later to Frankfurt. He felt the need to discuss with Kaschnitz the scientific problems in which they both had the most lively interest. Gerhard Kleiner was Kaschnitz's assistant in Kanigsberg and later became his successor in Frankfurt University. These three have devoted much time and effort to this excellent selection from his writings. I In the first volume the wife of the great scholar, the well-known poetess Marie Luise Kaschnitz, has written his biography (pp. 228-239). She describes not only the outer circumstances of his life, but also his interests, including literature, art and politics, and his connections with other important person- alities at different periods. In Vienna, although a student of the archaeologists Reisch and Borman, he became a member of the important Viennese school of art history founded by Riegl and Max Dvo~6ik. Hans Tietze also was his teacher. Kasch- nitz then became assistant to D6rpfeld in his ex- cavations in Athens. During the First World War he joined the Austrian army, but was sent to the group which protected Italian works of art. When as a result of the war the Austrian empire fell to pieces, he went to live in Munich. In 1923 he be- came assistant to Amelung in the German Archae- ological Institute at Rome. Here he found a new group of outstanding colleagues and friends. Among them were Gerhard Kramer, Karl Leh- mann and Friedrich Matz, whose ideas about Hellenistic and Roman sculpture gave rise to lively and fruitful discussions. Kaschnitz also had the most congenial relationship in scholarly as well as in human affairs with Curtius, the successor of Amelung. He worked on the supplement to Ame- lung's Vatican catalogue, two volumes on the sculptures in the storerooms of the Vatican, which was finished in 1930 but did not appear until 1936/37. He also worked in the Etruscan Museum of the Vatican and in 1926 published the first article, which was to make him famous, on the Vatican terracotta portraits. Several articles fol- lowed on late Roman portraits. Kaschnitz settled down at the University of Freiburg in 1932 where Professor Hans Dragen- dorff became his friend. Soon, however, Bernhard Schweitzer made Kaschnitz his successor in Koinigs- berg. Here he laid the groundwork for his history of structure in the lands around the Mediterranean. The articles, now in Vol. I, were mostly written in the University of East Prussia. Again he found many new friends and partners for scholarly dis- cussions. His lectures extended from prehistory to late Roman art. After Hitler came to power, Kaschnitz left K6nigsberg in 1937 for Marburg, where he could expand his studies. He had great sympathy for the innocent victims of the Hitler regime, which he showed in word and deed. In 1940 he succeeded Langlotz at Frankfurt Univer- sity, where he shared university seminars with the philologist Karl Reinhardt and other outstanding scholars. Meanwhile his ideas about structure in art expanded more and more. When Frankfurt was bombed by the Allies, Kaschnitz lost his seminar building. He fled to the mountains and then to</page><page sequence="2">362 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 his wife's home town, where he continued to work steadily. Later they were able to return for a short time to the destroyed city of Frankfurt but soon he was called to Rome, where he helped to re- habilitate the German Institute and became presi- dent, 1952-1955. Old and new friends gathered again in the newly opened Institute, not only Ger- mans, such as Curtius, but also many outstanding Italian and foreign archaeologists. Kaschnitz re- tired at 65 in order to finish the great work, which now appears as Vol. III after his untimely death in 1958. The biography is followed by a list of 41 works by Kaschnitz, 17 of which are reprinted or pub- lished for the first time in these three volumes (pp. 240-242). The photograph of Kaschnitz reading, seated below the colossal statue of a river god nick- named Marforio in the Court of the Capitoline Museum (p. vii), well illustrates his personality -an innate Viennese amiability overlying great seriousness and intensity. In the short Preface (p. vii) Helga von Heintze justifies the choice of works on structure and por- traits for the three volumes. Vols. I and II contain the articles on these subjects in chronological se- quence, showing the development of the ideas which are fully matured in the large posthumous book in Vol. III. In the Introduction (pp. ix-xv) Harold Keller, Professor of Art History in Frankfurt, draws a clear picture of Kaschnitz's intellectual develop- ment, from his interest in Roman provincial art to his relationship and later opposition to the Viennese art historians. This includes his lifelong wrestling with the problems of structure as the underlying normative power which takes the place of cosmic or divine energy as a symbol in art. This power is derived from the tendency to replace artistic ability with the artistic will (Kunstwollen) of Riegl. It is a subconscious dynamic movement. Keller finds the earlier formulations by Kaschnitz superior even to his later ones. This seeking for primeval structures in art led Kaschnitz to such periods as prehistory and late Roman sculpture, which Riegl before him had already recognized as being neither undeveloped nor decadent, but merely different from periods of perfect excellence such as that of Greek classical art. The reader of the "Short Writings on Struc- ture" ought to read first the sections before and after the eleven articles by Kaschnitz himself. Kaschnitz is often more difficult to understand than the summaries by his wife, colleagues and friends. The first article is a lengthy review of Alois Riegl, Spitr6mische Kunstindustrie (pp. 1-14). It was published in 1929, after the reappearance of this epoch-making book on late Roman art, pub- lished in 1927 in a handy size instead of resembling the luxurious first edition. Kaschnitz shares Riegl's violent reaction against the materialistic concep- tion of art held by Semper and other art historians of the nineteenth century, and against reconstruct- ing the history of art only from literary sources. Riegl used the idea of evolution developed by natural science to show the whole development of ancient art from its beginning to the latest period of Roman antiquity as an event conditioned by in- ner laws. Riegl, however, like Kaschnitz later, en- larged this natural system with the idea of will to art (Kunstwollen) and thus formed the new con- ception which Kaschnitz and others in the twen- tieth century have followed. Kaschnitz does not accept all of Riegl's point of view on the historical course of art, as modern knowledge has funda- mentally changed this earlier picture. He also criticizes Riegl's belief that the physiological proc- esses of the senses of touching and seeing (tactile or tangible, and optic) influence the development of art. He recognizes the importance of Riegl's ideas concerning the three main periods of ancient art: first, the tactile classical; the tactile-optic Hellenistic; and finally the three dimensional late period. In general, this conception is a great ad- vance, but it is wrong in details. Kaschnitz refuses to use it, and also other subjective and rigid criteria. He uses for the first time the word Struktur (p. 8), which has enough flexibility to determine the char- acter of each successive period. He also misses in Riegl and others the idea of space (Raum), the structure of which has to be interpreted just as does the structure of sculpture. By investigating this structure in each single work of art, we achieve en- lightenment about the living course of artistic devel- opment. Kaschnitz recognizes that the stylistic criti- cal method and the philological-historical method have already given us the outer historical course of art history. But this must be supplemented by study of each single work of art and by recognizing the nature of artistic reality in the forms of body and space. In Kaschnitz's opinion, this leads to an explanation of the transition from Greek to Roman</page><page sequence="3">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 363 art, and to an understanding of the real nature of Roman art. Later Kaschnitz made great contribu- tions to these important questions as well as to the philosophical conceptions of art as an essential factor in each period. He discusses fully the idea of Riegl's Kunstwollen (pp. 10-12), which he con- siders a revolutionary one. In contrast, he con- siders the attempt of his teacher Dvorik to make the history of art a history of ideas (Geisteswissen- schaft) as wrong; art is contemporary and of equal value, indeed even identical, with the ideology of each period. The word Structure in a title first appeared in 1933, "Remarks concerning Structure of Egyptian Sculpture" ("Bemerkungen zur Struktur der aegyptischen Plastik," pp. 15-37). Kaschnitz here defines the research in structure which aims at grasping by an objective method the construction and effective forces of the artistic creations of the Egyptians as well as of the Orient. He also uses the artistic will (Kunstwollen of Riegl) to explain the character of Egyptian art in contrast to Euro- pean art. While the latter tends toward action, Egyptian art tends toward masses brought quite early into abstract forms, as an interpretation of the world. There is no conflict or tension between in- tent of will and the character of masses, as there is so often in European art. The statues are built in stereometric, the reliefs in geometric forms. The goal of the structure of Egyptian sculpture is an integration of organic forms with the essence and the idea of eternity and unchanging existence. Kaschnitz calls this a metaphysical sphere. Un- like the European artist, the Egyptian artist wants to conserve life, not to reflect it in changing move- ments or individual physical forms. In the same year, 1933, Kaschnitz published re- marks on the structure of early Italic sculpture ("Bemerkungen zur Struktur der altitalischen Plastik," pp. 38-83). It is a continuation of an article published in 1926 as "Studies on Etruscan and Early Roman Art of Portraiture" ("Studien zur etruskischen und friihr6mischen Portriitkunst") rightly reprinted in the second volume together with other studies in Roman Portraits (II, pp. 21- 54). In the earlier article Kaschnitz had investi- gated the essential Italic quality in early Roman portraiture compared to Greek works of portrait art. In the later article, he revises the same prob- lem in the light of current changes which had oc- curred in the thinking of art historians. In earlier periods art critics had dealt with historical circum- stances and viewers' impressions, but Kaschnitz and his contemporaries now investigate the im- manent essence of artistic creations, their laws and expression. Instead of stylistic aesthetic comparison, Kaschnitz now investigates the will to form in Italic Etruscan art. He tries to penetrate the inner essence of each work of art, which he calls its struc- ture. The artist organizes the form of his work ac- cording to his conception of life. Structure is the effect of a mysterious power which in art takes the place of physical or divine energy. It finds its artistic expression in the individual work, in con- trast to the epochal and general will of art (Kunstwollen). European art from the beginning is full of con- flicts. The creative power of the artist is spiritual, in contrast to the nature of the material which is lifeless. This passive mass resists the abstract power of the artist's temperament. The artistic form is the product of this conflict. This is the character of Greek and Roman art. In the Orient, in contrast, there is no such conflict between spirit and mass. This conflict first appears during the eighth cen- tury B.c. in old Italic ceramic (figs. 15-17) in con- trast to the earlier middle European ceramic (figs. 10-14). The Italic dynamic structure is to be sepa- rated from the Etruscan static style and its ab- stract structure. Trade relations with other coun- tries, particularly Greece, however, brought to Etruria the understanding of organic forms and changed the structure of the art. The urge to form, no longer abstract but plastic form, leads to force- ful expression but sometimes also to barbaric de- formations. In the seventh century B.c. Greek structure for the first time influences the Etruscan. In the sixth and fifth centuries, and finally in the Hellenistic period, structures result in complicated new forms. Thus, the Apollo of Veji has his parallels in the Korai of the Acropolis, but the artist does not ac- cept their tectonic element which distinguishes all Greek sculpture. The structure of the dress, par- ticularly, is quite different in Italy, as seen in figs. 20-25 which are dated from 500 to the Augustan period. None has the Greek tension between struc- ture and organic nature. The Etruscans and later the Romans have a will to express their own es- sence. The Italic artists therefore represent dress as ornament, like the treatment on vases in the primitive period. They want plastic dynamic forms,</page><page sequence="4">364 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 which they carve out of the material in cubistic manner. Their attitudes are static, not dynamic. The material is not penetrated as in Greek art, only its borders are defined against space. In this re- spect it is related to Egyptian art. The surface of the cube, however, is richly penetrated by mental and spiritual forces, which is one of the reasons that static portraits like the Brutus are spiritually so expressive. The stereometric form easily accepts the psychological and personal character of the person portrayed. This results in the quality pecul- iar to Roman portraiture as contrasted with Greek portraits. The sober and order-loving Romans im- pose their will on the structure of the portraits, while holding on to the principles of their Greek structure. This is what makes Italic art so com- plicated, as Kaschnitz has well explained. "Remarks on the Structure of Greek Art" were dedicated to Curtius on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 1937 (pp. 84-92). They contain only partial discussion of archaic and classical Greek art. The art of the fifth century is described as an eternal realm, into which the forms of perception seek to enter in vain. The creative essence of clas- sical art and its eternal effect lies in the organic expansion of our consciousness into the regions of true being. We must investigate the structure of Greek art from the point of view of a metaphysical reality. The artistic structure of the Parthenon frieze is identical with the organization of a crea- tive event. Greek structure is a particular form which grew out of the intuition of the masters. The power of formation becomes visible in the material as a reflection of absolute and pure organic form. While Kaschnitz speaks with almost poetic en- thusiasm of Greek classical art, his true interest lies in the earlier phases. He draws a good picture of the development from cave painting to the megalithic culture of the Mediterranean. A sec- ond line begins in Europe with a magic realism and an active spirit. In all later European develop- ments, subject and object are not identical as in Egyptian art. Mesopotamian and Egyptian art give durability to their figures, while the Europeans want active forms. When the Nordic peoples came into contact with the Near East, latent Mediter- ranean forces were activated, and Minoan, My- cenaean and Greek art evolved. This complicated process finally led to the phase in which figures became a function of life, and life and form be- came identical. Greek art represents life in its temporary changing forms. In the classical period, the earthly life enters into eternal regions of pure being. "Remarks on the Double Roots of the Statue Form in Antiquity" were dedicated in 1944 to Wilhelm Worringer on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday (pp. 93-Io8). The first root, in the opinion of Kaschnitz, is the megalithic building in which steles, pillars and cubes symbolize unchanging and eternal spheres. The second root is the primitive idol, which becomes a statuette when put on a stand or ground line. This was lacking in the pic- tures in caves, which were not separated from sur- rounding nature, and in the idols which were lying, leaning or planted in the ground. A base makes them a separate standing statue (from Lat. stare, to stand). The Greeks added many more movements to the motif of walking, but statues like the Nikandre (fig. 32) and the Kouros (fig. 37) still kept the character of the early pillar or stele. First the statuette, then the monumental sculpture, accepted more and more dynamic action. This led to a tension between the two roots, until the classical statues developed new types and new structures. "Comparative Studies of Italic-Roman Struc- ture," I, published in R6mMitt 59 (1946), deals with architecture (pp. Io9-145). The main task of recent research in Roman art has been to dis- tinguish the Roman-Italic principles of structure and principal forms from the Greek elements. Kaschnitz believes that we can achieve this only by penetrating into the creative elements of struc- ture. He considers the Italian as the most impor- tant creative power which led to Augustan art. Greek architecture is plastic, all parts have their own body, but they also serve as part of the whole building. The outside is richly articulated with columns and entablature. In Roman architecture, in contrast, the main concern is the inside room, the form of which is made visible through the interior of the walls. Kaschnitz takes as examples the so-called auditorium of Maecenas (figs. 38-39) and the Pantheon. They are interior rooms with definite boundaries. The auditorium in its lower half is below ground, and therefore could not have an artistic form on the outside. The inner space is built in forms of sphere, cylinder and prism, with a quarter-sphere and a half-cylinder in the audito- rium, full cylinder and segments of a sphere in the</page><page sequence="5">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 365 Pantheon. The plastic decoration of the walls, with pillars, columns, entablature and moldings, is taken over from Greek architecture. Kaschnitz sees the original root of Roman archi- tecture in the caves in which man lived during the stone age and in later periods buried the dead. The curved room is excavated and made into the reg- ular form of a bowl. Niches and domes are laid over circles or ovals, symmetrically arranged at the sides of a central hall (figs. 40-43, 47). The rounded rooms gradually become rectangular (figs. 44, 46, 47). Then the Romans built the same forms above ground (figs. 50-5I). The apsis of Roman architecture still retains the character of a cave. The technique of pouring plaster allows the crea- tive Roman artist to build spherical and cylindrical forms in free space, instead of digging them out of amorphic matter. The Greek tectonic rectangular form was Romanized by adding the curved and spherical forms, first in the time of Sulla (Pale- strina). In late antiquity the Greek plastic decora- tion of the interior walls was replaced by mosaics, which emphasize the structure of the straight and curved walls much better than do the Greek plastic structures. An attempt to compare the structure of Egyptian and Greek sculpture appeared first in 1947 (pp. 146-155). Kaschnitz tries to use the general struc- ture of creativeness as a basis for distinguishing three main phases. These phases correspond to the development of Mediterranean man. The first stage is the attempt of the stone age hunter to dominate and to enhance his connection with nature by magic. By representing the animals he wished to capture on the walls and ceilings of caves, he believed that he could control them. These paintings have no artistic structure as yet. The second phase is Egyptian art, when man becomes aware of space, time, and death. The Egyptian artist represents pictures of nature in a structure of rectangular lines with mathematical boundaries, which makes them eternal and un- changeable (fig. 56). The third phase is Greek art. It combines form, life and durability by its creative power, in a plas- tic unity full of life and movement. A good ex- ample is the tomb relief of Hegeso (fig. 57). Curves and ellipses swing around a center. The organic forms of the women represented have an in- ner harmony. While Egyptian movements are only in a horizontal direction, and the static Egyptian form is in a vertical direction (figs. 58-59), Greek movements, for example in the battle frieze of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus (fig. 60) are full of tension and dramatic highlights. A lecture delivered at the University of Frank- furt in 1948, dealing with the problems of form during the transition from archaic to classical art, is here published for the first time (pp. 156-174). The change of style in sculpture in the early fifth century has often been explained as the conse- quence of the struggle with the Persians. Kasch- nitz asserts that the change had already begun in the late sixth century and is the clearest expression of man's attitude towards the world. In archaic art the statues are built according to a mathematical system of horizontals and verticals brought into proper relationship. Body and spirit are one and the same. It is the art of the leading aristocratic society. In the early classical period man differ- entiates himself from the world. The sculpture ex- presses this in a new rhythm of distribution of weight, raising and lowering of parts, which lead to a decisive change of structure. This culminates in the Periclean age when space and plastic struc- ture become a perfect unity. Kaschnitz illustrates these changes with three outstanding examples: the Youth of Tenea, around 540 B.c., the Kritios boy, around 480, and the Doryphoros of Poly- kleitos, around 440 (figs. 61-63). In classical art free and natural movement leads to a differentiated naturalism. The statue becomes the likeness of a true microcosm, an epitome of the universe. The organic forms interpret eternal laws. Freedom and necessity penetrate and neutralize each other in a perfect harmony. Eurythmy, that is the rhythm of organized movement, takes the place of stiff sym- metry. Instead of religious content, ethos and char- acter interest the intelligent artist. Kaschnitz makes an interesting comparison be- tween sculpture and the theater. Here also, in the sixth century at the Dionysiac religious festival, not only the singing and dancing chorus but also the spectators felt an immediate union with the god- head. In the fifth century the actors are separated from the chorus and the spectators by the back- ground building. The cult has become a spectacle, just as the statue is now separated from the viewer. The "Origin of the Spiral in the Agaeis" was first published in the Praehistorische Zeitschrift 1950 (reprinted pp. 175-197). The spiral is one of</page><page sequence="6">366 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 the motifs with an original symbolic and magic meaning, which had existed for a long time and in wide areas. It was used in central and southeast Europe as early as the late neolithic period. Kasch- nitz, in contrast to other researchers in prehistory, believes that it came to the Aegean countries not from the north, but from the Orient. It is indeed found in Ur on seals in manifold forms (figs. 64- 72, 75-77). From there it traveled to other Meso- potamian sites, and to Asia Minor. Thus, in Troy, rings were found (fig. 82) and spinning wheels decorated with spirals. It seems most likely that the spiral came to the Cyclades from the east. Here boxes and pans were decorated with elaborate pat- terns made of spirals (figs. 84, 88). The Minoan Cretans (figs. 8o, 86), the Helladic Mycenaeans, and finally the Greeks developed from this basic motif new forms of ornament, particularly com- binations with concentric circles, rows of S-spirals and many other designs. The spiral, however, is not the foundation for Minoan structure-instead it is dynamic irrationalism. A concise article on structure was written by Kaschnitz in I95i. It appeared translated into Italian by Paolino Mingazzini in the Enciclopedia dell'Arte Antica Classica e Orientale VII (1965), and the German retranslation is by Mrs. Kasch- nitz (pp. I98-202). Kaschnitz here defines the con- ception of structure as the principle of the inner organization of form. Before this method of re- search can be used, the art historian must arrange monuments according to style, finding spots and historical sources. The scholar then uses structure to define the foundations and driving forces on which each style is built. The author repeats in his- torical sequence the different structures of which he has spoken in earlier papers. He adds the char- acterization of Hellenistic art. Tension between the closed structure of classical tectonic art and new tendencies to enlarge art into infinite space leads to pathos and excesses. An article "On the Rationalizing of the Mythical Form in Classical Art" was published in 1954 in the volume Neue Beitr~age zur Klassischen Alter- tumswissenschaft on the occasion of the sixtieth birthday of Bernhard Schweitzer (reprinted pp. 203-215). This paper is a kind of supplement to the one on form problems of the transition from archaic to classical art (1948), and deals mostly with the development of archaic sculpture during the sixth century B.c. Kaschnitz chooses as an early sixth century example the Kleobis (or Biton) by Polymedes of Argos in Delphi (fig. 89). This statue personifies a mythical experience in which picture, material and viewer are a unity. In con- trast to the unchangeable stereometric Egyptian form, however, a tension begins between the severe structure in horizontal and vertical lines and the organic body. The subjective, mythical union is progressively replaced by objective under- standing of the real forms of the body. The statue and the viewer are more and more separated. The forms become more and more expressive and mate- rial, as seen in the later kouroi in Munich and from Anavryssos in Athens (figs. 90o-91). This leads to the rhythmical contraposition of early classical art. The distance between the human and the divine realms enlarges. The myth is no longer em- bodied in the statue, but must be explained by ra- tional intelligence. Individual beauty, not mythical content, is the goal of classical art. This is the last paper on structure. In an Ap- pendix, based on an unpublished lecture delivered in 1936 (pp. 216-227), Kaschnitz deals with sites and works of art of the agonistic idea. He sees the origin of the love of contest in all Greek forms of religious and literary (musical) life in the Homeric period, after the Helladic and the Nordic peoples had been melded together. The restless energies of the Nordic people became disciplined by the Greek static and passive love of law and order, and led to the manifold athletic and musical festivals. The best vision of these important agonistic ideas is transmitted by the red-figured vases of the fifth century and the statues of victors found at Olympia and other sanctuaries. II The second volume consists of six papers on Roman portraits, which have made Kaschnitz fa- mous. Gerhard Kleiner (Preface, pp. xi-xv) em- phasizes this fact, and characterizes the attitude of Kaschnitz toward Dvorik and Riegl. He also dis- cusses the meaning of the new doctrine of struc- ture, and its influence on contemporaries and on the present generation. Kaschnitz's first paper on Roman portraits was published by his teacher Hans Tietze in the Bib- liothek der Kunstgeschichte 80 (Seemann, Leipzig 1924; reprinted here pp. I-4). In this short paper Kaschnitz gives a condensed history of Roman</page><page sequence="7">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 367 portraiture. All Roman art develops later than do political and religious interests, in the service of which Roman art always remains. The portraits of the deceased are dry and boorish, until the in- fluence of Hellenistic art lessens their naturalism. The bronze statue of the "Arringatore" (see pls. 26, 2; 27, 2) shows the transition from Etruscan to Roman art. It is just as objective and harsh as contemporary literature. Then in the first century B.c. such heads as that of Pompey show the influ- ence of the portraits of Hellenistic rulers. Caesar, in contrast, is quite Roman in his cool intellect. The time of Augustus, however, imitates the style of the fifth century B.c.--it is classicizing, aristo- cratic and intellectual. In the first two centuries of the empire, the portraits of ladies and children are genuine creations of Roman art. In the time of the Antonines and particularly in the third and fourth centuries stoicism, orientalism and Christianity in- fluence art as well as philosophy and religion. The spirit becomes more important than the body. Chiaroscuro, light and dark, replaces plasticity. The eye becomes the mirror of the soul. The por- trait of the absolute ruler becomes monumental and frontal and remains so in mediaeval times. Realistic portraiture ceases to exist. "The Etruscan and Roman Portrait Heads of the Third to the First Century B.c." appeared first in Italian translated by Paolino Mingazzini as "Ritratti fittili Etruschi e Romani del secolo III al I av. Cr." in RendPontAcc 3 (1925) 325ff (retrans- lated by Mrs. Kaschnitz into German pp. 5-I9). Kaschnitz discusses the style and date of a series of terracotta heads, until then unpublished, in the Etruscan Museum of the Vatican. Two of these are modeled by hand, probably after living models of boys, by an Hellenized Italic artist in the late second century (pl. I, 1-2). From the middle of the third century on the Greek idealistic tint softened Italic naturalism. This led to a flourishing of portraiture, evident in the terracotta heads. They were pressed out of two molds, one for the face and one for the upper and back parts. Whole series were fabricated. In the Vatican, for example, there are 25 replicas of pl. 2, I and 15 of pl. 2, 2. They are always reworked by hand, so that they differ from each other. This is particularly true of the female heads pls. 3, I-2; 4, 2. All have definite individual features, and thus are intended to be portraits of different persons. Hellenistic pathos is replaced by Roman dignity. The eyes are plastically rendered, not painted as in the Greek models, with an engraved circle for the iris and a hole or point for the pupil. During the first cen- tury B.c. Hellenistic influence is replaced by clas- sicism, for example in heads which are similar in style to the bronze heads of a boy in Florence, the Arringatore and the Brutus (pls. 12-13). The ter- racotta heads were probably votive offerings. They show some interesting transformations of the same head--from a boy to a bearded man or even to a bald-headed old man (pls. 7-8). Some might have been used as portraits of ancestors carried at funerals, for example an old man modeled free- hand in simple forms, but with an expression of energy and brutal force (pl. 11). He probably belongs to the time of Caesar. In the Augustan period classicism created a changed art of por- traiture based on the Hellenistic-Italic-republican, but formed more particularly after the needs, con- ception and wishes of the Romans. "Studien zur etruskischen und friihraimischen Portraitkunst," "Studies in Etruscan and Early Roman Portraiture," appeared in RimMitt 47 (1926) (here pp. 21-54). Kaschnitz attempts to characterize Etruscan portraits from the point of view of art history. He rightly lays most emphasis on the lifesize bronzes, which he also compares with the heads of the deceased on later Etruscan ash urns. He considers these portraits as impor- tant Etruscan creations despite some Greek influ- ence. Some Etruscan bronzes were attributed to Roman art, for example the head of a boy in Florence (pl. 12), an adolescent of about fourteen, and the so-called Brutus (pls. 13; 19, I). Although it cannot represent the first Roman consul after the defeat of the Tarquinii, this excellent head, according to Kaschnitz, must render a strong per- sonality of around 300 B.c. A related bronze head in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (pls. 14; 18, I) depicts a man of about forty years of age with extraordinarily energetic features indicating a strong will. Another bronze head of a man about twenty-five years old, found in Fiesole and now in the Louvre, is dated by Kaschnitz ca. 250-222 (pl. 16). Stylistically and technically all these heads are masterpieces. The bronze head in the British Museum (pl. i8, 2), called a flamen, but probably an athlete, is of the same date. The "Brutus" is the most important work of this group. Kaschnitz analyzes the forms of this head as purely Etruscan-Italic. It shows neither</page><page sequence="8">368 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 eclecticism nor classicism, but specifically Italic cubism. The forms are dry, harsh and linear. The hair is not plastic but engraved. Each part is a plane without organic connection with the other planes, like the sides of a crystal. It is built up in a stereometric-cubistic manner, and reflects a con- ception of life different from that of Hellenistic ideology. This cubism is already found in the heads on early Etruscan urns (pl. 59) and is found again in late antiquity. There is no tension in the Brutus such as we find in Hellenistic portraits. We have here a sober naturalism in contrast to Hellenistic dynamism. These stereometric forms are later broken and softened by the influence of Hellen- istic organic forms, but the Italic-cubistic forma- tion is never lost. The observation of nature is always mixed with an inclination toward an orna- mental, sometimes even a barbaric, conception; for example in a head carved in limestone, in the Ber- lin Museum (pl. i7), the hair is laid in parallel curves. The head of the so-called Magnate (pl. 21), from a sarcophagus in alabaster with remnants of painting, is also related to the Brutus. Kaschnitz sharply distinguishes these late Etrus- can portraits from those of Republican Rome (pp. 40ff). In the earlier republican period Roman por- traits cannot be distinguished from Italic and Etrus- can works. Later, however, the masks taken from the dead, preserved in the house and used in funer- als, contribute something new. This inheritance of an old usage leads to a verism, an exact copy of na- ture, different from the naturalism of the Etrus- cans. This veristic portraiture develops during the second and first centuries into the purely Roman portrait. The Arringatore (pls. 26, 2; 27, 2) is the first example showing the influence of Roman verism on the earlier stereometric Italic-Etruscan forms. Hellenistic elements then play a growing role, but are replaced in sculpture as well as on coins during the second century B.c. by a coarser and sometimes even a brutal conception. In the first century B.c. the death masks are imitated in marble and terracotta. They show lips drawn awry, hang- ing chin, emphasis on the bony structure under the tightly stretched skin. The Romans believed such portraits to be replacements for the deceased. Roman verism pushed the sober naturalism of Etruscan art more and more into the background, for the Romans wanted pure reality. They pre- pared the way for late Roman and early Christian art. The Roman portrait emphasizes some details and suppresses others, so that the balance of all forms is replaced by strong accents of expression in eyes and mouth. In the Augustan period clas- sicism, that is a return to the earlier Greek con- ception, is combined with old Italic cubism, in order to create a pure Roman art. Even if the artists were Greek, they have adapted themselves to the new country and to the Roman community in which they live. Kaschnitz's interest extends to late Roman por- traits as well. He deals with these in "Spitr6mische Portriits" in Die Antike 2 (1926) (here pp. 55-60). Kaschnitz considers the development leading to abstract art in the time of Constantine the Great. It was an evolution from the connection with the earthly world to a transcendental sphere beyond the grasp of human experience. Art is the clearest mirror of creative human ingenuity. The different conceptions of classical Greek and late Roman or early Christian art can be grasped in a comparison of the Doryphoros by Polykleitos with the early Christian figure of the apostle Petrus. The creative spirit of the artist works in the former (pl. 33, I) with purely worldly means such as ponderation and proportion. A human physical body has been rendered and clarified in an artistic sphere. The Petrus (pl. 33, 2), in contrast, with his lengthened and distorted body, is an expression of the spiritual and religious life of the period. The transition from the earlier to the later portrait takes place during the third century, as clearly shown in a comparison (on pl. 34) between Septimius Severus (193-211) and Maximinus (305-313). In the later period classical unity is forever destroyed. Plastic appear- ance is dissolved into an atmosphere which be- longs to the world of thought and spirit. Facial expression is concentrated on single elements, par- ticularly the eyes, inside sharp outlines. Body and spirit are separated. The form is earthly, but the content is transcendental. In the period of the tetrarchy (pls. 36 and 39) the basis for Con- stantinian art is laid, in which the tendency to- ward purely spiritual expression is consummated. The head from the Basilica of Constantine (pl. 37, 2), with its wide-open eyes, shows with great intensity the power and dignity of the ruler, projected into unending space. All lines are harsh and definite, the transcendent has been material- ized by art. In contemporary reliefs the action is no longer given in profile; the emperor with his entourage</page><page sequence="9">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 369 sits facing the spectator in the center. All others are symmetrically arranged beside, below and be- fore him, for example on the Constantinian reliefs of the arch of Constantine (fig. 39, 2). There is no physical connection between the work of art and the people or the viewer, but rather a purely spiritual one. During the following period this abstract art continues (pls. 40-43). The old Italic elements in popular art, and the influence of the Orient and of barbarians nourish this abstract ex- pressionism. Little-known heads of Marc Antony, Domitian and Christ are the vehicles through which Kasch- nitz discusses the Italic character of sculptured form, from the republican via the imperial to the early Christian periods: "Marcus Antonius, Domi- tian, Christus," first printed in Schriften der K6nigsberger gelehrten Gesellschaft, Geisteswis- senschaftliche Klasse 14 (1938) (here pp. 67-88). The Marc Antony (pls. 46, 2; 47, 2; 48, I) in Bologna is identified by his resemblance to coins dated 34 B.c. (pl. 45) when Marc Antony was 48 years of age. It also resembles certain previously identified portraits, particularly the one carved in limestone at Cairo (pls. 46, I; 47, I) representing Marc Antony in the guise of Zeus. One might also add Marc Antony represented in the guise of Triptolemos, identified by M6bius, AbhBayr- AkWiss 19 (1964) 30-36, pls. ix fig. I, x fig. 3, XI figs. 4-9. The Bologna head shows the Italic stereo- metric method of rendering the hair, mouth and forehead in a linear style. The same construction is found in late antique heads, for example that of the bronze colossus in Barletta (pl. 48, 2), and in the portraits of Domitian as a young man. Un- fortunately the one formerly owned by Curtius (pls. 49, I; 50, I) is probably not ancient, accord- ing to H. von Heintze (p. 133, n. 20). The other (pls. 49, 2; 50, 2), formerly in the Villa Mattei, is badly worn. Only an enthusiast like Kaschnitz is able to recognize here a delicate rendering of life on the surface of a head in the Italic manner, which imitates a Greek Skopadic creation. Most important is the last part of the paper, on a head of Christ, now in Athens but probably carved in Syria or another Eastern province (pls. 51; 52, I; 53, 1). It was originally part of a seated Christ conceived as teacher, similar to the statuette in the Museo Nazionale Romano (pls. 52, 2; 54, 2; 55, 2), and also to poets reciting before a Muse on sarcophagi dated in the third century. Christ is represented as an adolescent. The head in Athens is the only one of considerable size that we possess from the late antique period. Kaschnitz dates it around 400. It is of lesser quality than the statuette. It recalls the Oriental conception of a youth growing to manhood with an inclination to voluptuousness in neck and chin, but with a firm look in the eyes. The head of the statuette, in contrast, depends on Greek ideas of beauty, but matter becomes only the vehicle for a spiritual symbol. The decayed classical forms are filled with a new life, which is an old Italic inheritance. The Italic artist does not form a plastic structure. He models in a stereometric form only the surface of the head at the borderline of body and space. He tries to express here the soul, mind and intellect of the person represented. Kaschnitz sees the same tendency in Roman artists from the Etruscan to the late antique periods. Their concern is with the transcendental world, not with a beautiful artisti- cally satisfying sculpture. The head in Athens is much more passive in its attitude, and the plastic form plays a decisive role. It has a mixture of Oriental and Hellenic art forms, similar to sculp- ture found in Palmyra and Doura. "The Italian Character of Official Portraits," "Der italische Charakter des offiziellen Portrdits" (pp. 89-122), is a reprint of an article "Uber die Grundformen der italisch-r6mischen Struktur II, Plastik," which appeared in Mdl 3 (1950). Part I, "Architektur," was published in RimMitt 59 (1944), and is reprinted here in Vol. I. Kaschnitz tries to show how Roman stereometric portraiture with the help of Greek tectonic structure developed into a purely Roman form, in which the Greek was more and more pushed into the background. The Italic tendency to form space came more and more to the fore. This began in the late republican period, but the real integration of Italic structure with classical Greek art came only in Augustan architecture, for example the Pantheon; in relief, for example the Ara Pacis; and in portraiture, for example the Augustus of Prima Porta (see other examples of Augustan portraits pls. 55, I; 56; 57, I). Exact copies of Greek statues kept the classical forms alive during the Empire. In portrait sculp- ture, however, the ideal type is more and more replaced by individual Roman likenesses in which the tension between our world and the super- natural grows. In the place of the whole plastic body the surface alone is used to connect the</page><page sequence="10">370 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 human being with space. The portrait of Trajan found in Ostia (pl. 57, 2), carved in the time of his adoptive son Hadrian, has a smooth surface, which negates the material character of the marble, but expresses the spiritual life of the subject. In the Antonine portraits (pls. 34, 2; 35, I) and par- ticularly in the portrait of Commodus at the Palazzo dei Conservatori (pl. 58, i) the plastic form is still more dissolved by the use of light and dark. Deep shadows in the luxurious hair and beard contrast with the smooth surface. The body is now the means of creating an optical pic- ture, best seen from a distance. The light dissolves and spiritualizes the surface. In the late antique period from the third century on the plastic ele- ment is still more flattened out and the stereometric tendencies of Italic art are used to reflect and ex- press the transcendental sphere (see Gordian III, pl. 58, 2, also pls. 39-43). The sharp borderlines of the planes which characterize these late antique portraits are already found in early Italic canopies, such as one in Chiusi (pl. 59). Thus the Italic cubistic form is the most important element in Roman portraiture of all periods, particularly in official portraits. III The last and largest volume is Mediterranean Art, A Representation of Structures (Mittelmeer- ische Kunst, Eine Darstellung ihrer Strukturen). It is a selection from an enormous manuscript writ- ten in different periods as the basis for a large work in which Kaschnitz planned to present in a con- tinuous way all the problems discussed in his earlier articles. His death prevented the final draft, and thus this important work remained a frag- ment. Peter von Blanckenhagen (Preface pp. ix-xx) describes the state of the manuscripts, only a few parts of which were ready for the press. Some sec- tions contain repetitions of former ones, represent- ing different drafts on the same subject. Other parts are missing. The editor has done an excellent job of choosing and arranging the right parts in the correct sequence. The sequence goes from east to west: Asia Minor, the Hittites, Crete, Mycenae, Greece, Italy, Rome. He gives an introduction to each of these sections, in which he renders an ac- count of his preparation of the text. Helga von Heintze supervised and supplemented the footnotes prepared by Dr. Rezia Knaur and H. von Gall, and also chose and provided the illustrations. Thanks to her most of the monuments analyzed by Kasch- nitz are pictured (pp. xx-xxi. See list of illustra- tions in the text and plates, pp. 519-530). In the Introduction (pp. I-2I) Kaschnitz dis- cusses the two tasks of art history. One is to study the work of art by the function of the senses (touch and seeing), led by intellect and intuition. Through description of content and form the style is de- termined, the historical development is character- ized, and connections as well as parallels with other creative appearances in culture and history are established. The second kind of art historical study is more objective. It asks what is the essence and inner organization of the work of art. It in- vestigates the creative process which has become visible in the form structure. The first type was predominant in the nineteenth century. The sec- ond was first used only by scholars interested in psychology, beginning with Riegl, whose Kunst- wollen (artistic intent) Kaschnitz had already dis- cussed and modified in his earlier review (Vol. I). He also repeats his idea that symbolic fundamental forms underlie earlier art, for example, the spiral or the cave. Kaschnitz then gives a definite explanation of his conception of structure (pp. I7f). He knows that the idea of structure is used by different scholars in a widely different way. He himself considers structure as the principle of the inner organization of form. In contrast to historically inclined stylistic criticism, the scholar of structure concentrates on the objective character of the works of art. He establishes the symbolic value of the fundamental structures. Research in struc- ture must come after the stylistic characterization, the finding spot and the historical sources have been established in the usual earlier manner, and have been put at the disposal of structural research. Structure investigates the foundations and driving forces on which each style is built. In the last part of the Introduction (pp. 18-21) Kaschnitz investigates the symbolic fundamental forms or roots of ancient art. The creative artist is not perfectly free, but is bound by forms of conceptions of life and by definite fundamental structures of the intent to form. He is a last living continuation of an old tradition, which, however, he can renew or change. The genius is fettered and free at the same time. He strives to grasp and explain the world in its eternal changes and limi- tations. The last foundations of the creative form</page><page sequence="11">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 371 are bound to the symbolic primeval forms of cult and religion. Therefore the greatest task for art history is to study the development and changes of fundamental principles and to define their sym- bolic value. The Near East or Asia Minor, better named West Asia (as it is neither near nor east of us) is called Vorderasien (front Asia) by Kaschnitz. He divides the discussion into two parts. In the first part (pp. 22-71) he investigates the prehistoric era as the original period of unchanging artistic and cultural qualities (Konstanten). The chronology, although not very clear, comprises neolithic periods of the fifth and the fourth millennium B.c. The places are from Mesopotamia to the Syrian coast of Asia Minor on the Mediterranean Sea, and from the Taurus mountains, the Caucasus, and the highlands of Iran to the Arabian desert. The con- stant achievements of the village civilization, ac- cording to Kaschnitz, are those which later con- tributed to the high city cultures of the Sumerians and other races of the third millennium B.c. He discusses in this sense the idols, particularly the mother goddess, and the bulls, symbols of fertility (figs. 2, 4, 5); the painted vases (Buntkeramik, fig. 2, pl. I) with their definite relation to hori- zontal and vertical lines derived from the law of gravity, and the torsion produced by lines, ribbons and other ornaments which underline the round form of the vases. Good examples are jugs from Ras Shamra and bowls from Samaria and Tell Arpatchiye. Centrum and periphery are empha- sized to give a dynamic character. Kaschnitz considers the beginning of landscape painting on vases (pls. 2-3) to be the root which leads to later landscapes on the stele of Naramsin (pl. I4) and on Assyrian reliefs. The sealstones, already invented and distributed in this period, show the urge to identify the per- sonality of the owner. Kaschnitz considers them a symbol for the extension of the ego into the outer world (p. 44). Buttons and amulets (fig. 3) are the origin of the sealstones. They, as well as vases, often have ornaments imitating the nets in which they were suspended. Besides the small idols which were votive offer- ings, there are some large heads from Jericho in Palestine and from Uruk which served as cult statues (pl. 4, 1-2). This is the first step in the direction of monumental art. The bodies were probably not of permanent material. In architecture the round hut was to have a long life and much later monumental successors for cult and public life. Rectangular buildings re- placed the round hut as dwelling places. The static arrangement of the rooms around courtyards re- sults from the transition from a nomadic to a settled life with agriculture and livestock. Stable buildings must be constructed horizontally on the ground, but the main walls are vertical, at right angles to the horizontal base and ceiling. Kasch- nitz calls this an orthogonal arrangement of the axes. In the second part Kaschnitz deals particularly with Mesopotamia, where the oldest high civiliza- tions of mankind evolved through man's own strength and creative activity (pp. 72-I37)--pri- marily the art of the third millennium B.c. in southern Mesopotamia, Sumer and Akkad. Here permanent residence and stability in cities led to the concept of duration as a value and, therefore, to durability of form in the creations of the human spirit. Thus temples and palaces were no longer built of reeds and other perishable material, but of clay bricks. Their massive forms suggest the idea of power and permanence through the symbol of heaviness. This is already the case in the oldest real architecture in the world, the so-called White temple at Uruk-Warka (fig. 7). It is developed from the structure of the orthogonal room of the preceding period, based on gravity with purely horizontal and vertical lines. This gives cosmic and eternal character to architecture. Yet there is also a tendency to lighten the rigidity of the masses. This is particularly clear in the later stepped pyramids, the ziggurats, which imitate a sacred mountain carrying the temple high up into the sky. The tension between the purely geometric ar- rangement and the living organic forms is strong- er in sculpture than in architecture. This tension appears first in sealstones and reliefs (pls. io-ii). The figures are rounded and curved, voluptuous and yet soft. The main subject is not only the animals, as in earlier periods, but man who domi- nates them and gains his riches from them. He is often placed in the center between symmetrically arranged animals, as their master, and he also de- fends them from wild beasts (pl. II, 2). In the third millennium this simple conception is en- larged into mythological stories. The protector be- comes a hero in the shape of a bull-god. The ani- mals are represented in human actions. On a seal-</page><page sequence="12">372 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 stone from Ur different animals walk on their hind legs to bring gifts to a seated lion (fig. 8). The first stone statuette with a distinct base found in Khafadje (pl. 6) shows clearly the ten- sion between the round and square conceptions of art in Mesopotamia. The woman is a worshipper. Her hands are folded below her full breasts in a gesture of adoration. She has protruding cheek- bones and a big fleshy nose. Her rounded body and skirt are an attempt to render nature faithfully in a massive geometric form. Monumental sculpture begins with the wish to express the superhuman divine character of the ruling class. Heads of women from Uruk-Warka (pl. 4, 2) and Khafadje (pls. 5; 7, i) show a lively observation of nature, combined with decorative effect. This is attained by a spheric form in which large curves for hair, eyebrows and eyelids, nose and mouth are carved in strict symmetry. Circle and curve are also the main elements of the statuettes carved in soft stone (alabaster?) from Tell Asmar (pl. 8) and the hard diorite statuette of Entemena, ruler of Lagash, about 2700 (pl. 9). They stand on round bases in a gesture of adora- tion. The contours of arms, shoulders and legs are built of bowlines. The different dresses cling schematically to the round bodies. The heads are oblong, the eyes are enormous circles. Hair and beards are carved in parallel waves. The oblong woolen tufts of the skirt of Entemena are laid in six ornamental layers. The conception of the heavens and world as a sphere has won out over the conception of the orthogonal system with rectangular, horizontal and vertical forms, and the spheric basic forms remain constant in Meso- potamian art. The seated Gudea, ruler of Lagash, about 2400, reflects the same conception (pl. 15). The statue is composed of cylinders, cones and spheres. The natural forms are sharply ground off and highly polished, to give them sharpness and duration. There is no further development possi- ble in this direction. It is perhaps for this reason that Kaschnitz never wrote about the third part of western Asia, Babylonia and Assyria, although he seems to have planned to do so. An important part of Mesopotamian sculpture consists of the steles with rounded tops, probably derived from megalithic stones and intended to celebrate rulers who won victories over enemies. They generally show representations in horizontal stripes, or the standing figure of a god or ruler. A good example is the later stele of Hammurabi with the celebrated code of laws for Babylonia around 1750 B.c. The most grandiose example is the unique stele of Naramsin of Akkad (pl. I4). The victorious King storms up the mountain, where the King of Guti falls backward, dying. The victorious army marches upward in two diagonal lines, while the defeated army is scat- tered among the trees of the mountainside. The life and dramatic content of this most impressive work of art of the third millennium is well de- scribed (p. II4). In the discussion of Mesopotamian sculpture Kaschnitz often compares and contrasts it with Egyptian art. In the chapter on Egypt (pp. 138- 209) he continues these comparisons. The fertile Nile valley was occupied by different peoples from different directions, who brought the elements from which the Negada civilization of the fourth millennium B.c. developed. From Libya came the late neolithic cave paintings with sickle- shaped ships, imitated on red clay vases (pl. 16). From Palestine came the idols with birds heads (pl. 17, 2). From the south via Nubia came the wild animals, which together with the tame ones are represented on the ivory handle of a knife (pls. 28, I; 29). Among the animals are the lion, elephant and giraffe, which live in Central Africa, but not in Egypt. From these seeds a high civilization in exemplary logical consequence developed and matured in historical times. The Egyptians had a strong feel- ing for the order of the world and its natural laws. This affected the conception of space and its struc- ture, which was conditioned by the gravity of rec- tangular (orthogonal) division of spaces. The verti- cal lines and planes, at right angles to the horizontal foundations, became the normal planning and joining. The Egyptians liked strong geometric forms, prisms and squares of gigantic scale. All monumental architecture and sculpture is domi- nated by this stereometric character. Kaschnitz deals with Egyptian tombs and temples from the earliest times to the fourth dynasty (pp. I54-170). He describes how round forms were abandoned for rectangular ones and how tombs became progressively larger and more durable. First they were excavated in the ground, for example the tomb of King Wedimu in Abydos (fig. 9). A monumental character was achieved when megalithic elements were added by plaques</page><page sequence="13">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 373 of granite, and walls of square stones were set into the excavated mass of earth. Then mastabas were built above ground in stone. Finally the pyramids were raised, first as step pyramids like that by Djoser at Sakkara (pl. 18) built by Imhotep, the first great architect whose name we know. He combined the mastaba with megalithic build- ing and added forms of the early reed hut by lining the walls with mats braided from reeds. These rooms are small, imitating real rooms in which the deceased was supposed to live. The rooms are built into the stone mass as in earlier times they had been built into the earth. During the fourth dynasty the pyramids were covered with megalithic polished plaques, forming a smooth prism, expressing the eternity of the tomb. The temples erected during the fourth and fifth dynasties in Giza and Abusir (figs. io-iI) and at Medum (pl. I9) consist of entrance halls in the Nile valley and of cult temples for the deceased on higher ground connected with the entrance building by a long causeway. They are all built according to the character of gravity, in square blocks laid out in clear lines and forms. They symbolize in a perfect manner eternal duration and indestructible life. The steles representing the king or high officials are a continuation of the megalithic menhirs. Such a pair of steles is represented inside the cult temple of Neferseshemptah near Sakkara (pl. 19, 2) from the time of the sixth dynasty. The portrait bust of the deceased is in the sham window above the narrow sham door, his statues in the niches at the sides of the door. Although worked almost in the round, the sculpture is actually cut out of the wall. The figures partake of the eternity and durability of the architecture. Egyptian architecture retains this character until the end. Sculpture in the round (pp. 170-I90) derived partly from the idols, which developed into statuettes. As in Western Asia, in the predynastic period the statuettes kept the rounded basic forms of sphere and cylinder, for example an ivory lion (pl. 17, I) and the terracotta figurines of a seated woman with bird's head (pl. 17, 2). Advanced examples are a granite lion (pl. 27, 2) and the small slate figure of a man in the Ashmolean museum at Oxford (pl. 25). This little man is still built like a pile-shaped idol. The head is a full sphere, the body shows alternately flat and rounded parts, and the arms and legs are cylinders. The large and simple round forms pass softly into each other. The inner structure and organic tec- tonics of the human body are glossed over by the brilliant technique of the stone grinder and polisher. Egyptian sculpture began to change during the second dynasty of the Old Kingdom. The seated statuette of Chasechem (pl. 24) is inscribed in an orthogonal block with horizontal and vertical axes, which gives it the character of eternity and unalterability. The seated statue of King Djoser of the third dynasty (pl. 22) shows progress in the same direction. The limbs and forms of the body are more clearly separated from each other. The plastic structure is strictly carried through. The forms become crystal clear planes, even the head with its headdress. The forms are more and more adapted to the orthogonal system. The pose of the King is more upright and taut. The upper body has the form of an octagon, and the whole statue has the shape of a cube. The final stage is reached in the fourth dynasty with the seated statues of Chefren, which share the character of the architecture of the temple. The shape of the body has become more naturalistic, but is depend- ent on the strong system of invisible vertical and horizontal planes. The cubical seat and the back plate have the megalithic forms of the powerful architecture of Giza. Temple and statue are of one and the same style. This is the final stage of Egyptian sculpture. We find the same character of genuine monumentality in the tombstone of Ranofer of the fifth dynasty (pl. 21). Its back pillar is a prism, the base a square. The body is mathematically symmetrical, carved almost in the round. The eternal and in- destructible form imparts dignity and sublimity to the statue of the ruler. This remains the char- acter of Egyptian ruler portraits down to the time of the Ptolemies. The discussion by Kaschnitz and the illustrations of this chapter are not presented in the historical sequence that this reviewer has chosen. The Egyptian relief (pp. 190-209) interests Kaschnitz particularly in relation to the origin and earliest history of the low relief. The minor arts of the predynastic period recall the Mesopotamian cylinder seals and reliefs on stone vases. The handle of a knife from Gebel el Arak (pls. 28, I; 29) shows a hero dominating two lions as well as rows of animals in Sumerian style. The other side</page><page sequence="14">374 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 shows a row of warriors engaged in single com- bat and a sea battle, and seems to celebrate Egyp- tian victories over enemies on and near the Nile. Kaschnitz assumes-probably rightly-that this handle is the work of a Mesopotamian immigrant, who worked for Egyptians and represented their deeds. This style was then accepted by Egyptian artists and applied to their cosmetic trays carved in slate. The earliest, dated at the time of the first dynasty, is the fragmentated bull tray (pls. 30-31). It shows how the Egyptians used foreign models in cre- ative ways. On both sides the King as a bull tramples a nude enemy with curled hair and beard. On the front at right angles to this group is a row of standards. As yet there is no unity of design. On the reverse side is the King as a lion in pro- file, inside a city wall seen from above. All parts are very plastically rendered as they are on the knife handle. The forms are, however, firmer and surrounded by more precise curves. The folds, sinews and muscles have the tendency to freeze into ornamental curved lines. This tendency continues on the tray with a lion hunt (pl. 32), which has a fully Egyptian char- acter. At both short ends are lions wounded by several arrows. The one on the broader side fol- lows the outer edge as does the first attacker, while the other hunters follow the two long sides. The lion on the narrow side turns his back to them. Between the two rows of hunters at the in- side is a row of different animals. There is as yet no overall composition, but there is a new style. It is flat, linear and geometrically precise, recalling prehistoric neolithic rock drawings. In contrast to these, however, the Egyptians have learned from Mesopotamia to accept naturalistic details. The next step in development is shown in the handle of the club belonging to King Scorpion (pl. 36) and in the cosmetic tray of King Narmer (pl. 33). King Scorpion is represented with the crown of Upper Egypt, towering high above his surround- ings. On the tray King Narmer is also much larger than his followers. On the front he wears the crown of Lower Egypt. He inspects the bodies of his enemies laid out on the ground at right angles to him, in two rows one above the other, their severed heads between their legs. In the second row two small attendants hold the necks of two snake-lions in leashes. The long necks of the beasts cross each other, forming a circle around the de- pression for the paint. In the third tier the king in the old form of a bull tramples an enemy. On the back of the tray there are only two tiers. Here the king wears the crown of Upper Egypt, and lifts his mace against a fallen enemy. In the lower tier two prisoners seem to flee from the royal bull on the front side. Despite some older motifs, the style is now perfectly Egyptian. The groups are no longer plastic as on the bull tray, the figures are flat, as if pressed between two plaques or cut out of the ground with sharp contours and without overlapping. The design of the Narmer tray is more firm and precise than that of the Scorpion club. Kaschnitz assumes that-as in sculpture in the round-the Egyptian artists have discovered the cosmic law of gravity, which demands vertical and horizontal lines and axes representing the in- ner structure of the plane. Therefore the form of the tray no longer influences the composition, as it did in the lion tray. The reliefs on the tiers of the Narmer tray stand horizontal to the vertical axis of the tablet. Thus, the orthogonal space allows one to visualize at one glance the tray and the pic- tures. The lines are calligraphic, expressive orna- ments. The two roots of Egyptian reliefs, the rock paintings and Mesopotamia, seem to be united in the tray with four dogs from Hieraconpolis (pls. 34-35). The relief is stronger and at the same time the natural forms are transformed in an expressive ornamental style. All figures follow the law of antithetic symmetry: The four dogs move away from each other at the long edges; on the front, turned to the paint roundel, are ibis and lion above, a snake lion below. On the back two giraffes turned to the central palm tree emphasize the symmetry. This is the final structure of Egyp- tian reliefs. Kaschnitz does not go into the later rich development, although he seems to have planned this (see p. 207, n. 213 by the editor). The Hittites are the only Oriental people in the second millennium B.c. with whom Kaschnitz deals, and that perfunctorily on three pages (2IO-212). He discusses only one bronze statuette of a seated god from Bogazkiy of the first half of the period (pl. 37) and two reliefs cut into the rock in Yazilikaya, dated i4-I3th century B.c. (pls. 38-39). Kaschnitz calls the statuette of northern Syrian character, which he does not define. He compares the reliefs with the early stele of Naramsin (pl. I4) and with Egyptian reliefs (pl. 40). He finds</page><page sequence="15">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 375 the Hittite reliefs, in contrast, more forceful and energetic in their movements, rather brutal, and more lively than the older reliefs of Asia Minor. He finds the plastic structure enlivened from the in- terior and sees the expression of dynamic organiza- tion, although the movement is rather stiffened. He compares Hittite art to late Mycenaean, architec- tonic-megalithic, a character found also in the buildings of Bogazk6y. The sacred rock is covered with flat pictures. This short discussion of the Hittites is part of the chapter which also deals with Crete (pp. 213-234) and Mycenae (pp. 234-242). Cretan art is rightly defined by Kaschnitz as a new and strange phenomenon among early civiliza- tions. Its dynamic character breaks through the strict boundaries of Oriental structure and fills them with lust for life and expression. A sensual fullness and color of nature combines with the will to form for a new creative task which produces subjective occurrences in new naive structures. This fundamental structure appears in late neolithic vases which remind one of soft leather bags or gourds. All sharp demarcation lines are avoided. In the second Early Minoan period, in the Cyc- lades and in Crete, jugs appear with long beaks (pl. 43, 2) or of an eastern Mediterranean or west Asian form, painted with lines or stripes laid diagonally around the body of the vase (pl. 41, 2). But in Middle Minoan art this decoration is re- placed by naturalistic forms of plants, flowers and animals, for example the octopus (pl. 41, i). The sea creature moves from above to below diagonally between coral reefs, and thus follows and em- phasizes the bulky form of the vase. Other motifs which come originally from western Asia but are used differently in Crete are the cult of the Great Mother, the cult of the bull, the idols, sealstones, the symbol of the double axe, the at- tempt at landscapes, and the spiral. There is also in Early Minoan glyptic the carving of animals circling around a central point (pl. 43, I). Megalithic elements are found only in parts of the architecture of palaces, in staircases and bridges. Otherwise the Cretan palace architecture is a maze (labyrinth) and conglomeration of small, even miniature rooms designed for graceful, even sensu- ous living. The columns in wood look like table legs with broad, softly swelling capitals covered with bright colors. The walls are covered with frescos and stucco reliefs reproducing the gay life of the court and the marine life around the island. The steatite vases describe harvest festivals, pa- rades, garden scenes and other events in their momentary appearance; as do the celebrated golden cups found in Spartan Vaphio, according to Kaschnitz the work of a Cretan artisan (pl. 44)- They depict not only the bulls' capture and life in captivity, but also their emotions and impulses, their fight in helpless fury, their resignation and their love life with strong dynamic characteriza- tion. In the opinion of the reviewer, these cups already show some of the tectonic spirit of the Mycenaeans and might be by an artist influenced by Cretan art. During the Late Minoan period about 1500 B.C. Minoan art loses its power. In its stead the Helladic Mycenaean art of the mainland finds new energy of creation through the Achaeans and Ionians who invade it during the first centuries of the second millennium B.c. They learn through the Cretan import. In the shaft tombs of the sixteenth century B.c. we find a mixture of Nordic tectonic elements, brought by the Greek Achaean immigrants, with Cycladic and Cretan styles. The new tendencies of the Greek mainland transform the mobile Cretan naturalism into a static picture with frame. The organic and naturalistic pictures of life be- come pure ornaments. Tectonic structures take the place of Cretan dynamic. Clouds and natural ground lines become stylized spirals. The My- cenaean artists evolved their own figurative style, as shown in the fragments of a silver crater found in a shaft tomb (pl. 45, i). The contours of war- riors are drawn in flat bowlines, in low relief sharply defined from the background. Inner or- ganization as the foundation of body structure is clearly indicated. Form and composition have a tectonic character. The monumental architecture of the Mycenaean castles, the domed tombs and the Lion Gate (pl. 45, 2) have taken over the structure and technique of the megalithic style. The two heraldic lions above the colossal lintel of the facade of the Lion Gate have a representative and perhaps apotropaic sense in a sphere of powerful monumental static structure. With the fall of the Mycenaean Empire such monumental structures disappear for a long period. Greek art rightly takes up a very long chapter in Volume III (pp. 243-332). Kaschnitz, as usual, is most interested in the origin and early develop-</page><page sequence="16">376 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 ment of this art, which laid the foundation for European art. Therefore most of the text and 30 of the 37 plates are given to the geometric and archaic periods, so that only seven plates remain for the classical and Hellenistic periods. Kaschnitz sees clearly the problem of how to distinguish between late Helladic-Mycenaean ele- ments, Nordic elements brought by the early Greeks and Doric elements brought by the late immigrants from Illyria and eastern Europe. The decayed Mycenaean foundation is penetrated by a new will to create a new structure. Instead of the concentric circles and half-circles, for example on a protogeometric amphora of the ninth century B.c. found in the Kerameikos of Athens (pl. 46), the maeander in the eighth century appears in a very developed and variegated form, for example on an amphora from the cemetery before the Dipylon gate (pl. 47). Both show a new organiza- tion of the vase as well as of the expressive and symbolic decoration. Kaschnitz sees an inclination to a microcosmic image in the simple articulation of the walls of the vases, even a simile of the hu- man body. He sees the character of monumentality and of harmonic unity even in these early products. The Dipylon vases are decorated with strictly horizontal and vertical patterns and bands. A broad field is given to representations of prothesis and funerals for the person whose tomb these monumental vases decorated, or to whom they were dedicated. Law and order dominate an active dynamic decoration; they also dominate the pic- tures. It is the first appearance and the elementary essence of all Greek tectonic, that is well-ordered art. Geometric Greek art develops the same character in the animal bronzes, particularly horses (pls. 48- 49) and men (pls. 50-53). Freedom and necessity, subjective life and objective law are joined in harmony, and remain the formal subject of all Greek art. In Cycladic art the marble idols still show barbaric inorganic forms with faces built like masks (pl. 51, i) similar to Hittite bronzes. In contrast the early Greek bronze figures of men are full of life and intense spiritual expression, for example the man from Olympia (pl. 51, 2) with arms spread horizontally. These arms follow the orthogonal system of axes and so does the early mythological bronze group of a Centaur and a hero, perhaps Herakles, in the Metropolitan Mu- seum at New York (pl. 52). A bronze warrior from the Acropolis in Athens (pl. 53) shows a particu- larly energetic animated face, but the forms of the body are still rather vague. Lively expression and organic energy fight against orthogonal coordina- tion and bring conflict and tension into early Greek art. Later the living forces break through the primi- tive system of verticals and horizontals, and real body forms replace the geometric skeleton. Oriental models responded to the artistic endeavor of the Greeks, as shown in ivory statuettes found in Dipylon tombs (pl. 58, i). The same conception of a fuller and richer life is attested by the Homeric poems. During the Orientalizing period of the late eighth and the seventh centuries Kaschnitz sees a widening of the horizon, the discovery of immense possibilities and a penetrating spirituality which takes possession of the new discoveries. The crea- tive situation of this time, however, is not yet as- similated or adjusted. Thus a terracotta head of Apollo found in his sanctuary at Amyclae (pl. 56, i) is full of spiritual energy, expressed particularly in the wide open and piercing eyes. The sharp and harsh lines of the head seem to empty the plastic content in favor of the spiritual expression. This is a European element in contrast to the Oriental character. During the seventh century the contact of mat- ter with sensual form is strengthened. The artists begin to organize the body elements objectively and methodically. With extraordinary force the rich treasures of Mediterranean and Oriental pic- tures are taken over. In the beginning the paint- ings, for example on shields found in Tiryns (pl. 54, I) and drawings on Boeotian fibulas (pl. 54, 2), are clumsy and awkward. The models probably came with minor art objects from Assyria, but they are rendered with original power. The complicated motifs of heroic battles, despite their childishness, prepare for the greatness and monumentality of later Greek art. The European spirit begins to awaken. Monumental temples are decorated with sculptured friezes, for example at Prinias on the island of Crete (pl. 55, 2). At the end of the seventh century the Kouros is created, the Greek monumental figure of aristocratic young men. It develops into a Doric-Peloponnesian and an Attic- Ionic branch (pls. 63; 70-74). The cult statues were originally of wood, or a wooden kernel was dressed in bronze, as in Dreros on the island of Crete. They imitate Oriental bronze statues. In</page><page sequence="17">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 377 the votive statues, for example those of Nikandre found in Delos (pl. 59), we have the combination of the megalithic menhir-stele with a tectonically conceived figure of a woman. This type also is continued into the archaic art of the sixth century, for example in the peplos-Kore found on the Athenian Acropolis (pl. 76, I). The girl from Auxerre (pl. 58, 2) is also based on the primitive structure of a menhir stele combined with stereo- metric forms of cone, sphere and cylinder. In con- trast, the two women of a group from Crete, carved in ivory and in the Metropolitan Museum (pl. 58, 2), are built up according to architectural principles, The figures have an inner life. They conceive the human spiritual, sensual and intelli- gent character in a mixture of naive impartiality and sophisticated culture, which is derived from Minoan and Oriental tradition. In the sixth century two great, sharply separated groups develop: the Doric in Crete and the Pelo- ponnese, Rhodes and Italy; the Ionic on the west coast of Asia Minor. Attica evolves its own style, combining Doric and Ionic elements with its own tendencies. Doric sculpture begins in the early seventh cen- tury with the bronze statuette of the Mantikles Apollo, found in Thebes and now in Boston, made in the early seventh century (pl. 61). It is strictly frontal. The vertical axes and the horizontal cross- ing them divide the body into sharply separated parts. The lack of feeling for organic nature is shown in the fact that the dedication inscription is written on the thighs of Apollo. The end of the development toward a real structural unity and a living body animated by spirit and will power is shown in the marble figures of the twins Kleobis and Biton in Delphi (pl. 63). Organic nature, law and material are bound together in a unity by the subjective creative will of the artists. This from now on is the main goal and subject of Greek sculpture. Ionian sculpture develops later than Doric, in Asia Minor and adjacent islands. Naturally it ex- periences strong influence from the Near East. Many examples have been found in the sanctuary of Hera on the island of Samos, among which the Hera created by Cheraniyes is the best known (pl. 65). Similar to early Sumerian statuettes, for ex- ample that of Entemena of Lagash (pl. 9) and to the later statues of Elam, for example the bronze statue of Napir Azu found in Susa (pl. 64), the Hera is built up of cylindrical and spherical forms, which give it a heavy volume and peripheral boundaries around a center. The male seated Ionic statues, best represented by the Branchidae (pl. 68, 2), and the standing male, best represented by Aiakes of Samos (pl. 69, I) and other statues in Samos (pl. 70), are all fully dressed in contrast to the nude Doric men. They resemble Anatolian gods and rulers in their cylindrical structure, spherical heads and heavy volume. They differ, however, from these in that they have more movement and activity of the material form. They have a more constructive tectonic character. The soft curves of the body show through the dress, and the drapery itself is more expressively modeled. The artistic form, how- ever, still remains on the surface. The later Ionic forms under the influence of Greek will to form can best be studied in statuettes found in Samos (see Buschor, Altsamische Standbilder). The faces are more tense and the bodies more tectonic than the earlier cylindrical bulky statues of Asia Minor. Attic archaic sculpture is contrasted by Kaschnitz to the Ionic and Doric. It is influenced by both, first by the Ionic, and by the Doric after the mid- dle of the sixth century. The Attic statues, how- ever, are differentiated by a large narrow head, slender hips, short legs, plump lower legs and feet. Kaschnitz uses as his main examples the early Kouros in the Metropolitan Museum (pl. 71) and only the head of the related Dipylon Kouros, to which Evelyn Harrison has recently assigned im- portant body fragments (Hesperia 24 [1955] 290- 304, pls. 81-84). The description given of the flat curves of the Kouros with soft interacting transi- tions and the linear character of the surface also applies to the Dipylon example. The tension which goes through the whole body is concentrated on the surface of the curvatures. The surface is hardened like a crust or outer shell. The expression of the face betrays an inner activity, particularly well ex- pressed in the wide open eyes, which look at the world as would an awakened young animal. Kaschnitz sees in the mathematically precise forms of the abstract curvatures a spiritualization of the sensual form. The process of enlivenment and dynamic action gradually softens the rigid crust of the surface. In the Attic Kouros of Volomandra (pl. 72) a more natural movement and more in- tensive observation of nature begins. This process is continued in the peplos Kore (pl. 76, I) and the rider Rampin (pl. 66, 1). The marble surface</page><page sequence="18">378 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 shows more and more delicate sensibility. The heads become more and more lively and natural. Abstract laws are eventually replaced by sensual artistic structure, and the tensions of early archaic sculpture are relaxed. At the end, around 480, the Kritios boy (pl. 76, 2) begins to show the contrast between carrying and carried elements in the struc- ture of the body. This trend is continued in the early classical period (450-410), in the head of the Townley Apollo in the British Museum (pl. 67, 1) and in the Omphalos and Kassel Apollos (pls. 74-75). The archaic smile expressing joy of life dis- appeared in favor of an expression of seriousness, conscious of the severity of the cosmic order. The limits of human power have been recognized. The archaic spirituality is tempered by the human in- tellect, which recognizes the elements of the cosmos and the power of fate and transcendental laws. The full harmony of the body and the unity of pure existence is reached with the Doryphoros of Poly- kleitos (pl. 79, i). The statue is now closed within itself and against the world. It is a microcosm mir- roring the macrocosm. The genuine group, built with two connected figures, also developed in the late archaic and early classical periods. We can best follow the changes in pedimental groups from the Herakles fighting with Triton in the Peisistrate Poros temple (pl. 77), to the Theseus and Antiope from Eretria (pl. 69, 2) to Aegina West (ca. 490), Aegina East (ca. 480) to Olympia (ca. 460). We can see the change from tectonic conflict to naturalism. The culmina- tion is reached in the group of Aphrodite in the lap of her mother Dione. This is the perfect solu- tion to the problems which a group presents for the artist. The single figures have become one organism. In the Periclean period, high classical sculpture has become serene and accomplished; the same is true of architecture and drama. The intellect turns to tectonic structure and to perception of nature. Freedom and necessity are united to a higher order in the Athenian democracy. The work of art and its viewer are no longer identical as they were in the archaic Kouros and the dionysiac chorus. The viewer is forced by the artist to look at the work of classical art from a defined standpoint, as he is also by fifth century drama. The works of artists and poets become the object of consideration and judgment. The classical figure is transferred into an ideal world and has become an image of the cosmos. Polykleitos in the Doryphoros as well as in a book has laid down the laws of symmetry and eurhythmy of the human body. Form and con- tent are separated, abstract ideas, ethos and char- acter are expressed in beautiful shapes. In the following century Kaschnitz observes a widening of the classical character into a mobile and cosmopolitan realm. The absolute perfection and harmony of classical sculpture is dissolved in the fourth century by Skopas and Praxiteles. In the Lansdown Herakles, the artist, probably Skopas (pl. 78) breaks up the closed structure of Poly- kleitos' statues and points in a symbolic form to the infinite. The distribution of weight and accent becomes irrational. The body turns to the relaxed leg, the head is lifted, the activity is directed to a distant end. Praxiteles also differentiates the ele- ments of the structure. Lysippos in his Apoxy- menos (pl. 78, 2) spreads the figure in still more indefinite space. The viewer has to go around the statue following a cone of rays emerging from all parts of the figure. It is now a part of the whole world. The proportions follow optical laws. In the Hellenistic period Kaschnitz finds a tendency towards dissolution into cosmic world unity. The position of man in the world has thoroughly changed. His aim is transcendency, a widening into the cosmos. An irrational pathos takes the place of the classical ethos. The material becomes only the medium for passionate and pain- ful striving, as in the Pergamon altar (pl. 79, 2). At the end of this chapter, Kaschnitz gives a summary of Greek art (pp. 315-321). He finds changes of content in the changes of creative forms, which correspond to the changes in philosophy, poetry and politics. Yet he does not find a straight and steady progress. The rhythm of the different periods alternates between revolutions and a return to earlier periods. Thus he finds in Hellenism a still further development of late archaic tendencies. Objective and subjective, existential and expressive periods alternate. Yet there are constant elements which in their creative ideas distinguish Greek art. An objective point of view drives the Greek artists to a continuously developing and always more intensified observance of nature, which no na- tion before them had achieved. An appendix to the chapter on Greek art deals with the representation of dress (pp. 321-326). Kaschnitz follows its development beginning with neolithic symbolic ornaments painted on the nude</page><page sequence="19">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 379 body, then dresses with the same symbols. The Greeks for the first time saw the dress as well as the human body in the light of cosmic laws and nature. They used the inexhaustible possibilities of expression for dress in the archaic period in an abstract way, so that drapery and body form a plastic unity. The classical period recognized that the dress in contrast to the body is dominated not only by the laws of gravity and by the will of the wearer, but also by air and by the movements of the wearer. This increases the means of expression in an extraordinary way. The dress loses its adher- ence to the body, either by emphasizing or con- trasting the movements of the wearer. The dress paraphrases the plastic form of the body. Kaschnitz contrasts the Nike of Paionios (pl. 8i) with the Nereids from Xanthos (pl. 80). The older Nike of the fifth century is still a tectonic unity; dress and body are modeled out of the same bulk. On the Nereids from a tomb in Xanthos of around 400, part of the dress is fluttering in passionate move- ment and the body appears nude where the dress is pressed against it by the sea wind. Gravity and wind join to form a pictorial rhythmical drapery. The Nike of Samothrace of the early Hellenistic period (pl. 82) adds an irrational element to the observation of nature. Stormy movement and a strong wind heighten the composition to a whirl. The torsion sends parts out in different directions. The whole structure is dissolved in contrasts. A last paragraph (p. 326) deals with the treat- ment of hair as form for artistic expression. Kaschnitz ends with the Hellenistic use of hair for emotional and psychological energy in the Pergamon altar of the second century B.c. (pl. 79, 2). This appendix was originally part of the text on Greek art, but the editor has rightly separated it from this context. The second appendix deals with the structure of Greek architecture (pp. 327- 332). This was the most complete of three at- tempts which the editor found among Kaschnitz's papers-it is fragmentary and sketchy, but has some good statements. The Greek art of building is characterized as articulated structure. For the first time the tectonic, that is the tension and differentia- tion of carrying and carried members, is brought into perfect balance. The classical period creates, in the Doric temple, a closed and restful unity. It has a microcosmic order of measure and rhythm similar to classical sculpture. In the Hellenistic pe- riod the richer Ionic and Corinthian styles are preferred. The typical forms of the tectonic articula- tion, however, have been forever preserved. The last part of the book is divided into VI: Italy, and VII: Rome. For Italy Kaschnitz begins with the earliest period and ends with the second century B.c., dealing mostly with Etruscan art. The second part begins with the republican por- trait, except for a few late Roman portraits, and ends with the Pantheon. As always, the earlier phases of development interest Kaschnitz more than the later ones. The background for Roman art is much more complex than that of all other Mediterranean countries, and development begins much later than in any other. In the Bronze Age, immigrants from the Balkans, Illyria and other cen- tral European regions did not yet have a developed art structure. The whole body of an idol from Dimini in Thessaly (pl. 86, 2) is covered with painted ornamental lines similar to those on early vases from southeast Europe (Bandkeramik). These vases continue in the so-called Fossa civiliza- tion in central Italy into the seventh century B.c. Fossa means burial. This culture was replaced by the Villanova civilization, in which the dead were cremated and their ashes buried in urns. These urns were molded of terracotta (pl. 98, 1-2) or bronze and were often an anthropomorphic imita- tion of the human body. Arms or nipples were added and human faces were attached to the cover. In the seventh century the importation of small objects from the east brought with it an orientalizing style in which the models were de- formed. Thus on a bronze kettle with a tripod base, found in the Tomba Barberini (pl. 85, I), birds with human heads stand on bull heads. The shapes are simplified. The figures seem to be com- posed of inflated rolls, which are divided by a kind of cord. The solid bulk is puffed out in a baroque and exaggerated manner, which is an essential trait in middle Italian sculpture. A similar style is seen in the contemporary gold jewelry of the Tomba Regolini-Galassi in Vetulonia (pl. 84), the Tomba Barberini in Palestrina (pl. 85, i) and a tomb from the necropolis near Bologna (pl. 85, 2). The imported small Syrian-Phoenician products, which themselves were influenced by great Assyrian and Egyptian art, must have strong- ly influenced the artisans who created these Etrus- can masterpieces. These men may have come with</page><page sequence="20">380 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 or after the Etruscans from Anatolia, and worked to please the rich settlers. The Italian artisans, al- ready skilled in terracotta and metal work, also influenced the style and made it indeed complex. The brilliant smooth planes and roundels are over- burdened with whole herds of animals, sphinxes and lions. This results in optic-plastic tension and a barbaric overloading. This baroque fullness is quite unoriental and genuinely Italic. Kaschnitz compares Minoan art, but also late antique Ro- man sculpture and architecture, decorated and overloaded with mosaics just as the golden fibulae were overloaded with granulated animals. With the Etruscan immigration during the eighth-seventh centuries came a definite new con- ception of plastic forms in sculpture. Their artists took the volume, that is the bulk of available mate- rial, as a solid foundation. The periphery, the ex- ternal boundary or surface, was the only part used for plastic modeling, a technique similar to that used in Asia Minor. In Etruria, as well as in the east, this led to the rendering of mimic and psycho- logical emotions which we find in Etruscan and again in later Roman sculpture. The Etruscans had a feeling for voluminous and bulky forms, which corresponded to the eastern imports. They rendered the latter in a barbaric and exaggerated manner. This can be seen for example in the lions belonging to the German Institute in Rome (pl. 86, I), the head of a sphinx, perhaps from Vulci, in Berlin (pl. 87, I) and a centaur from Vulci (pl. 87, 2). All belong to the seventh century B.c. They are cut out of soft stone and show the symbiosis, or permanent union, between eastern and Euro- pean-Italic elements. The material is mobilized for a heightened will to expression, which strikes us as barbaric and baroque. The school of Veii produced in the beginning of the fifth century one great artist, Vulca, who is said to have made the sculptures decorating the Capitoline temple of Rome (Pliny, Nat. Hist. 35.157). To him or his school may belong the large terracotta sculptures found at Veii, now in the Museo Giulia in Rome. They represent the conflict between Apollo and Herakles over a stag, and stood with other figures on the ridge of a temple roof (pls. 83; 88, 2; 90-91I). At this time the Etruscans ruled not only in Rome, but had also penetrated into southern Italy with its Greek colonies. Greek artists from Corinth had settled in Etruria, and Etruscan artists knew Greek archaic art. They did not copy it, however, but changed and restyled it according to their own dynamic and expressive will to form. Kaschnitz made an ex- tensive comparison of the terracotta sculpture from Veii with the marble frieze, created about twenty years earlier, from the treasury of the Siphnians at Delphi (pls. 88, I; 89-91). The Veiian sculptor changed the Greek rational and harmonious mod- els according to his own passionate and active character. Expression of passion and dissonance distorts the proportions. The curves become flat and complicated, the movements vehement, the articulation abrupt. The dress is used to heighten the expressive quality of the statue, and is de- formed by an expressive ornamentation. Etruscan art is irrational and dynamic. It is the beginning of the baroque artistic intent, which finds its con- summation 2ooo years later in the art of Toscana, the successor of Etruria. "Without the Apollo of Veii, Michelangelo's achievements would not have been possible" (p. 369). The inclination to clear, metallic contours of forms, the tendency to em- phasize the plastic expression in the surface and to dissolve these surface forms in light and shade, are inherited from the earlier bronze period and later transmitted to the Romans. In the fifth century the relation to Greek art diminished. The harmony, balance, organic and tectonic structure of classical Greek art did not appeal to the Etruscans, who still dominated Rome and central Italy although their kings were over- thrown in Rome. Their own art has three constant characteristics: I) stereometric boundaries; 2) ir- rational movement and ornamental expressive modeling of the surface; 3) bulky volume which is cut out of space. We have, therefore, only a few Italic-Etruscan sculptures, mostly created in Chiusi, which can be compared with classical Greek works. The best are tomb statues of seated women, hol- low to contain ashes and with movable portrait heads inserted (pl. 99). They are the successors of the archaic canopies. Their structure combines soft modeling of the bulky material with clear and sharp boundaries at the surface. The Mars of Todi (pl. IoI) can be compared to classical works of the early fourth century, but is distinguished from them by dry stereometric sim- plification, unharmonious proportions and puppet- like motions.</page><page sequence="21">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 381 The Hellenistic style appealed to Etruscan artists much more than did the Greek classical style. From the third to the first century B.c. the baroque elements of Asiatic schools were adapted to Etrus- can works. The terracotta head probably of Paris from a high relief (pl. 94, I), the head of the peperin statue of Orpheus in Rome (pl. iio) and others imitate the leonine hair of Alexander the Great, his complicated neck-movement and the up- ward glance of his eyes. In contrast to the Greek models, there is no inner life, but only swelling and modeling of the surface. The same lack of inner reason for movements is found in a bronze statuette of Herakles in Naples (pl. 92, I). In contrast to Pergamene baroque, the proportions are distorted in favor of abrupt motion and intense action. Expressive and decorative ornamental forms are used side by side and give the statuette a rather abstract character. Portraiture is one of the most important Etruscan contributions to Roman art. There is no dividing line between later Hellenistic-Etruscan and Roman republican portraits of the two last centuries B.c. Kaschnitz has treated this subject before in Vol. II, but here it is supplemented by some useful comparisons. Thus, the third century bronze head of a boy in Florence is compared to the Egyptian scribe from Sakkara (pl. o103). Both are extremely lively. The head of the scribe, however, is objec- tive, intelligent, ready with body and soul for his duties. The Etruscan head has an inner subjective life expressed in the play of light over the harsh metal surface. Another useful comparison is made between elderly men on the covers of sarcophagi, dated in the second half of the second century (pl. Io6, 2), with coins of L. Titurius Sabinus (pl. o107, 2) which show the invented portrait of King Titus Tatius Sabinus, dated 87 B.c., but probably based on a portrait of the second century. They both show study of nature and the influence of Hellenistic portraiture. Finally, the bronze head of a child in the Louvre, dated in the first century B.c. (pl. 109, I), is compared to the head of the youthful rider from Cape Artemision (pl. 10o9, 2). The Etruscan bronze and similar terracotta heads (pl. io8, 2) have effective contrasts of light and shadow on the surface, which is closed against space. It is a fore- runner of later works by the Della Robbia family. The Hellenistic bronze, in contrast, is a study of nature in passionate inner excitement and tension which loosens the plastic form into high swellings and deep furrows. Other useful additions are the late republican tufa statues of a togatus and of a woman in the Hellenistic type of Pudicitia (pl. 93). They belong to the pyramid type with narrow shoulders and broader lower parts. The toga shows this to be a time of urban Roman influence. Kaschnitz calls the style of this Campanian couple vegetative and finds the same character in the acanthus of column capitals. He thinks that these soft flowing pasty forms of the dress indicate a reaction to the Roman urban style. But toga statues and the type of Pudicitia are, in the opinion of the reviewer, char- acteristically Roman. I would consider this pair a Campanian provincial adaptation of two popular portrait types. This chapter on Italy is difficult to read. The material is complex and the author has made it more involved by not following a chronological order (which the reviewer has tried to do). The long chapter on Rome (pp. 401-518) is divided into: Roman art; republican portrait; Italic urban Roman portrait; monumental por- trait; Augustan portrait; late antique art of por- traiture; Augustan relief; wall painting; Italic- Etruscan and Italic-Hellenistic architecture; space architecture. Some of these topics and also those in the preceding chapter on Italy had already been discussed in four paperbacks published after the death of Kaschnitz by Helga von Heintze: R-mische Kunst, I. Das Schapferische in der r6mischen Kunst (The Creative in Roman Art, 1961); II. Zwischen Republik und Kaiserreich (Between Republic and Imperium, i96i); III. Die Grundlagen der republikanischen Baukunst (The Foundations of Republican Architecture, 1962); IV. Die Baukunst im Kaiserreich (Archi- tecture in the Imperium, 1963). (Rowohlts deutsche Enzyklopdidie, Rowohlts Taschenbuch Verlag, Reinbeck bei Hamburg, nos. 134, 137, 150, 151.) These are lectures given at Frankfurt University, and they are in a much simpler and clearer style than is the large unfinished book. The preliminary reading of some sections of these modest but valu- able volumes is highly recommended. Kaschnitz tries to clarify the complicated situa- tion of Roman republican portraits by dividing them into: Ia) Rational portraits of ancestors (pls. III-II13); Ib) Simple transposition of the veristic</page><page sequence="22">382 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 ancestral portraits into the Hellenistic form lan- guage (pls. 116-117); Ic) Late Hellenistic re- styling under the influence of the urban Roman ancestral portrait (pls. 118-II9; 120; 121); IIA) Urban Roman portraits influenced by Italic dy- namic-baroque structure (pls. 120-121); IIB) Urban Roman portraits influenced by the Italic stereo- metric, or cubistic, structure (pls. 105, 2; Io7; 122- 123, best among these Norbanus Sorex in Pompeii). This complex division is made more complex by the many heads which show not only one, but two or even three of the different earlier trends. The picture becomes clearer when we come to the monumental portrait (Pompey, Cicero, Caesar: pls. 123, I; 124-127) and finally to the Augustan portrait (pls. 128-131). This whole long discus- sion (pp. 405-460) is difficult to follow because of the tortuous language. This part was evidently not yet ready for the press. The same subject matter is treated much more lucidly in the same author's R6mische Kunst II (pp. 105-134)- Yet this last book also has many valuable new contributions to our deeper understanding of genuine early Roman art. It goes more deeply and in a more comprehensive manner into the Ro- man creative power to shape portraits than did the earlier most important books on this subject: O. Vessberg, Studien zur Kunstgeschichte der ramischen Republik (I94I), is most valuable for collecting the material; A. Zadoks-Josephus Jetta, Ancestral Portraiture in Rome (I932), has worked out the importance of the death masks of ancestors of patrician families; B. Schweitzer, Die Bildnis- kunst der r6mischen Republik (I94I), has divided the Roman republican portraiture on stylistic grounds. For example, he describes the style of the rational ancestral portrait (Kaschnitz Ia) as a "wood carving style." Kaschnitz, although he sees that a faithful transfer of death masks or waxen ancestral portraits is attempted, sees also the effect of Hellenistic portrait sculpture in agree- ment with the general Hellenization of urban Rome in literary, artistic and philosophical respects. He further sees the continuation into the imperial period of the ideas of ancestral cult, together with the Italic rational and veristic conception of por- traiture. Thus Kaschnitz penetrates deeper than any other scholar into the Roman national essence and the objective and sober Roman interpretation of Greek forms. He finds the essential Roman in the linear and pictorial forms of the surface, which bestow life on the death masks. The portraits incorporate the virtues of the men, virtues which have survived them. They are veristic in contrast to the naturalism of Hellenistic portraits. Kaschnitz defines as veristic sculptures those which strive to awaken the illusion of reality, while naturalistic sculpture strives to imitate reality. Monumental art developed with the help of Greek art, mixed with old Italic traits. The sober intellect of the Romans eliminates Greek passion, feeling and sentiment. The forms may be Hellenistic, but the content cor- responds to Roman mentality. The Hellenistic structure has been adapted to the new Roman patrons' ideas, conceptions and rational intellect. This is particularly clear in the statue of the general from Tivoli (pl. 120, 2), dated around 75 B.C. The leading personalities in Rome during the second half of the first century B.c. were represented in many portrait statues which in classicistic forms emphasize the historical importance of the sitter. Thus the Italic and Hellenistic baroque forms are used to render individual traits with realistic details taken from older Roman portraits. The picayune physiognomy of Pompey (pls. 124; 125, i), the humanistic philosophy and political knowledge of Cicero (pl. 123, I) which we find also in his writings, the superior will power and intelligence of Caesar (pls. 126-127), are rendered convincingly in a mingling of the Hellenistic baroque with urban Roman conception of nature. The different strains of late republican Roman portraiture are combined to form an absolute unity in the portrait of Augustus, particularly in the Augustus statue from Primaporta (pls. 128-129). A Greek artist endowed with superior technique has rendered the Roman dignity and the will power of a superior personality with creative empathy. The pathetic baroque is discarded in favor of simplicity and a realistic conception of nature. The physiognomy is sober and cold, the expression is one of energetic will power and high intelligence. The new imperial ideas are expressed in the reliefs of the corselet. They appear sharply cut out of space, and their surface, like that of the hair, is mobilized by optical effects of light and shade which play over the tactile metallic planes. There is still a trace of stereometric principles in the roundness of the head and the elliptical seg-</page><page sequence="23">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 383 ments of the face. Hellenistic structure is definitely replaced by genuine Italic-Roman totality. The Roman forms are harsher and more severe than the Greek, but the spiritual content is more pro- found. Historical events, the symbolic and allegor- ical representation of the universality of the im- perium and of the Pax Romana, as well as the intellectual and characteristic traits of the person represented, combine to materialize the Roman spiritual and transcendental world of idea. Kaschnitz believes that fundamental and lasting Italic and early Mediterranean traits play a large role in late antique art. Leaving out the first two centuries A.D., he proceeds directly from Augustan portraiture to the late antique (pp. 463-466). He begins with the Gordian emperors (pl. I34, 2; Gordian III, 238-244) whom he contrasts with the "immediately preceding late Antonine era." He may mean the Severan era, for he names Alexander Severus (222-235, pl. 135, i) as a representative of the "first third of the third century," during which the first signs of a structural change from Greek to Roman have taken place. Kaschnitz considers the perfection of this new structural attitude to have been reached in the colossal statue of Constan- tine the Great (312-337), which Constantine erected in the basilica he appropriated from the builder Maxentius after defeating him under the sign of the cross. The material is now consolidated. The statue is strictly frontal; the eyes stare into infinite distance; the head expresses pure being. The orthogonal structure of unending space has become the eternal sphere of pure existence, into which the figure of the emperor is admitted. The part dealing with relief (pp. 466-475) con- sists mainly of the frequently made comparison between the Ara Pacis (pl. 136) and the Parthenon frieze (pl. I37). The Ara Pacis, like the Augustus of Primaporta, has a new creative sense. The new element is the space which becomes of equal value with the bodies. In the Parthenon the single bodies are clearly isolated from the ground and each other. In the Ara Pacis the figures give the im- pression of a mass of persons crowding each other in the same attitude, united in the atmosphere of a historical and symbolic moment. The back- ground is stone projection of the same space which surrounds the figures. Single figures emerge from or merge into this background. The corner pillars, together with their entablature, provide the frame into which the procession of figures, as well as the acanthus ornament in the lower frieze, are set like vistas in space. The precise and clear forms are cut into the outer hard surface. This agrees with the creative forces of the Italic-Roman will to form. The ideas behind the representation are also Ro- man. The classicistic, cool character of Augustan art is due to the fact that the Italic-Roman will to form has been forced, against its own nature, to use the Greek corporeal forms. Roman glyptic (p. 472-474) is dependent on Alexandrian workshops, which had developed over a long period the art of cutting hard stones. This technique is related to the Italian taste for cutting the outer boundaries of the volume. Thus, the court artist of the early imperial period produced such masterpieces as the "grand camee de France" in Paris and the Gemma Augustea in Vienna, as well as smaller gems like the Augustus enthroned next to Roma, also in Vienna (pl. 138), all repre- senting important political and dynastic ideas. Harsh plastic form and the optical effect of light are contrasted as in the Ara Pacis. Spiritualization of the plastic form begins here and finds its monu- mental final expression in the portraits of the third century. Faience plastic, too, derives from Egypt, for example the portrait of Augustus in the Metro- politan Museum (pl. 134, I), where the reflecting surface mirrors highlights and shades and contrasts with the harsh material. Roman wall painting is treated in a short sec- tion (pp. 475-478) in which as in most cases Kaschnitz deals only with the early period and its relation to the preceding Greek concept. He calls these the first style and the second or incrustation style, terms taken from the fundamental division by A. Mau, Pompeji in Leben und Kunst (I9oo) 446-459. Mau and L. Curtius, Die Wandmalerei Pompejis (1929) 70-200, deal with the stylistic de- velopment. Schefold, Pompejanische Malerei, Sinn und Ideengeschichte, deals with the cultural and religious ideas behind the development. Kaschnitz, in contrast, deals with the formal principles of the Greek tectonic objective and the Roman aesthetic- subjective character of wall-painting. The Greek wall and its decoration are a unity. When, for example, on the sarcophagus of the mourning women (pl. 139) the mourners in the intercolumnia of the architecture lean against the background, the figures, columns and entablature</page><page sequence="24">384 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 are shoved into the wall like reliefs. In Roman wall decoration of the first style (pl. I40) a dualism of reality and appearance develops. The quarry- stone wall is decorated with colored stucco, imitat- ing the structure of a real wall. Sometimes a gallery opens in the upper part with a vista into a neutral- colored outer space. In the second style only pillars and entablature imitate real architecture. The re- maining space opens to show architectural motifs which, in perspective arrangement, lead the eye into depth, for example in the bedroom from Boscoreale in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and in the Mystery Villa (pl. 41i) from Pompeii. Thus, the real interior room and an apparent world behind the outer wall are con- nected. A more advanced phase is found in the house of Livia on the Palatine (pl. 142). The pillars are replaced by illusory columns, standing on a protruding base and carrying a ceiling. Be- hind them a second wall is painted, the two sides of which open up, through doors, to groups of buildings in the background, while a picture with mythological subject and landscape occupies the center. Thus there are organized, alternating sym- metrical and axial rooms. The gaze of the viewer is sometimes led into the distance, but is partially obstructed by inset walls. There is tension between reality and the appearance of artistic structure. The surface of the wall produces boundaries and new space at the same time. The last part of the last volume discusses archi- tecture: a) Italic-Etruscan and Italic-Hellenistic Architecture; b) Space Architecture. We find the same division in the published lectures Romische Kunst III, The Foundations of Republican Archi- tecture (Die Grundlagen der republikanischen Baukunst, 1962). The content corresponds to pp. 479-504, but the lectures are much more clearly or- ganized and expressed. In both there is a continu- ous comparison of Roman and Hellenistic archi- tecture. Kaschnitz tries to show the differences based on creative ideas. The Greeks plan, con- struct and build up in tectonic-plastic forms. The Romans have an optical-decorative conception. They use the Greek forms of columns, the three orders and their entablatures, as pure decoration which is embodied in the wall. The Greeks used them standing free as single bodies, with sharp distinction between the supporting columns and the carried entablature, while the Romans amal- gamated them with each other and with the wall, to become the boundary of space. The Italic-Etruscan temple is mostly known to us from Vitruvius (De Arch. 4.7), written in the Augustan period, and from the terracotta revet- ments which protected its perishable wood con- struction (see A. Andrdn, Architectural Terracottas from Etruscan-Italic Temples [1939/1940]). Kasch- nitz uses as examples of the original plan with three cellas the temples of Orvieto (pl. I45, i) of the fourth century and the temple of Signia (pl. 144, I) of the second century B.c. Another type is represented by Temple C from the Largo Argen- tina in Rome, originally built in the fourth cen- tury, and the temple of Gabii (pl. 144, 2), dated in the second century. Both variants show the in- fluence of Greek models which, however, are trans- formed by Italic taste. The main reason is adapta- tion to the religious use of Augurism, which need- ed a wide open space for observations of the sky and the surrounding ground. This is why half the square ground-plan was given to the front hall. The other half was given to the three cellas of the gods, particularly Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, but also to other triads. The outside was built with a heavy protruding roof, overloaded with decorations. The three cellas left no free space for a surrounding columniated hall. They open on the front hall and this opens on a large staircase leading up to the podium on which the temple is elevated. When there is a surrounding precinct, the visitor's gaze is carried up to the front of the temple, and then he is drawn upstairs to the front hall, the cella and the cult statue. Frontality is one of the most characteristic peculiarities of Italic-Roman archi- tecture. Kaschnitz explains this as a loosening from this earthly world, and as leading to the godhead. The second period of pre-Roman temples, the Italic-Hellenistic, is dated by Kaschnitz from the third to the middle of the first century B.c. He as- sumes that with the conquest of Tarent in 270 B.c. the art of Campania and Magna Graecia brought a systematic Hellenization to central Italy. The architects now used Greek tectonic forms but shifted them to the region of boundaries of space. These tendencies culminated in the architecture of Augustan classicism. The Italic architects used the alien forms in order to realize and materialize their own intent to create interior space. Kaschnitz uses as examples for this development the temples</page><page sequence="25">1967] A MONUMENT FOR KASCHNITZ VON WEINBERG 385 on the Largo Argentina, the temple of Gabii (pl. 144, 2) and the temple on the Forum of Paestum decorated in a mixture of Doric and Corinthian architecture (pl. I146), published by F. Krauss and P. Herbig, Der Korinthisch-Dorische Tempel am Forum von Paestum (1939). These temples re- place the side cellas with alae, that is wings of the colonnade at the front now extend to the two sides. The back wall remains closed. The central cella is broadened and its walls lose their plastic character. In the temple of Hercules at Cori (pl. 145, 2) the walls are decorated with pilasters ex- ecuted in stucco. Thus the cella has become a uni- fied cubic room. A variant of the Hellenistic-Italic type is the temple of the Capitoline Triad at Pompeii built by the Hellenized Oscans in the tufa period of the second century and renovated by the Roman vet- erans settled by Sulla in the first century B.c. in Corinthian style (pl. 147). The three cellas have be- come spacious rooms decorated at the two long sides with a colonnade in two storeys. A podium at the back carried the cult statues of the three Capitoline gods, and its lower part was divided into three small chambers. The wide intercolumnia of the front hall are replaced by narrow ones. Around Ioo B.c. the pseudoperipteros of the Hellenistic temple, that is the imitation of a colon- nade laid around the outside wall but really merged into it, is used in the Ionic temple of Fortuna Virilis in the Forum Boarium at Rome, and the Maison Carrie at Nimes (pl. I43). Here the pos- sibility of using the Hellenistic tradition for en- largement of space is stretched to the utmost. A real peripteros was built in the late second cen- tury B.c. in the Doric temple on the Forum Holi- torium at Rome and the Temple of Apollo in Pompeii (pl. 147). Yet here also the hall has no tectonic relation to the cella, but is a purely deco- rative covering. The Italic temple thus presents a frontal unified whole even after it has been Hellenized. Kasch- nitz believes that this was reinforced by a similar tendency of later Hellenistic architects to reduce the plastic appearance of the temple in favor of a more frontal one, for example in Kos (pl. 149). The central Italic temple with its optic-farsighted effect is related in its most creative being to this tendency, used for arrangements such as in Orvieto (pl. I45, 2), the temple of Gabii (pl. I44, i) and the Apollo temple on the Forum of Pompeii (pl. 147). The square surrounding the temple becomes a part and an enlargement of the temple plan. It becomes the anteroom to the dominating temple and together they form, in an Italic sense, an in- dissoluble unity. This unity is reinforced in the Forum of Julius Caesar and culminates in the Forum Transitorium of Nerva (pl. I55; cf. P. H. von Blanckenhagen, Flavische Architektur und ihre Dekoration [19401). The last section is called "Die Raumarchitek- tur," "The Architecture of Space." By this expres- sion Kaschnitz means the immediate architectonic shaping of rooms with the help of modeling mor- tar, particularly for the different kinds of vaulting. He finds the root for this in subterranean rooms and in the cosmic concept of the Mediterranean peoples. He finds the beginnings in the Early Bronze Age where first in Iran, then in Egypt, rooms built of clay are covered with barrel vaults or domes. Yet these are still a plastic expression of the orthogonal structure. In Iran we find rep- resentations of sunshades as a symbol of the dome of the sky. This later became the symbol of the dignity of the kings and finally of the popes. The canopy of Babylonian kings, the Roman naiskos and the baldachine over Christian altars, also rep- resent the heavenly vault. In Greek lands the barrel vault was used from the fourth century B.c. on only for channels, in the third and second centuries for buildings above ground such as tomb chambers and fountains. In Etruria at the same time arches were used for city- gates and tombs. Kaschnitz finds the real root of Roman space architecture, however, in the subterranean tomb architecture of Spain, North Africa, Italy and Pal- estine. Beginning with cave tombs in Lucania (pl. 156, i), and Sicily (pl. 156, 2-3) containing only irregularly rounded chambers, the plans gradually take the form of a cross or a leaf of trefoil, and the chambers acquire a more regular spherical shape in Cyprus (pl. 157) and Sicily (pl. 158). Sometimes a dromos, a passage, is cut from the outside into the rock and continues inside, with rounded chambers on both sides. In all these cases the rooms are cut out of the amorphic material, rock or earth. While the rooms are, so to speak, modeled out of air, the material becomes its bound- ary. Thus the Greeks shape bodies, the Italics shape space. When the boundaries are excavated by the action and function of the human arm, they become</page><page sequence="26">386 MARGARETE BIEBER [AJA 71 round or elliptical. Kaschnitz believes that the axial and symmetrical arrangement of the rooms is a transposition of the arrangement of the human body into the hollowed-out material. Kaschnitz sees in these prehistoric tombs the fundamental form of Roman monumental archi- tecture. In contrast to the Greek, the Roman tem- ple includes not only the statue of the god, but also man who visits the godhead. The subter- ranean plan is transferred to above-ground build- ings in Sardinia (pl. 159) where it is covered with a tent roof, and in Sicily, where it takes the shape of a beehive (pl. i6o, i). The facades of the Sicil- ian and Sardinian tombs are also the forerunners of later Roman facades (pls. i60, 2-3; 162). From a simple rectangular frame for the entrance, they develop into rich profiles of arches and even pilasters cut in relief into the front of the tomb. In another case, a whole entrance hall with pilas- ters is cut out of the rock (pl. 161, 2). Imitations of such subterranean buildings are found above ground in Malta (pl. 162). They are built of large stones, then covered with earth and surrounded by an oval outer wall. The entrance facade forms the segment of a circle. The plan is strictly axial. Several oval chambers accompany the central cor- ridor, which ends in an apse. Kaschnitz jumps from these prehistoric build- ings directly to the Pantheon (pl. 164), in which he rightly sees the consummation of the Roman creative structure, built with purely Roman ideas and techniques. The room is created out of the eternal and unchangeable shapes of sphere and cylinder. The ceiling represents the starred heaven. Man can here identify himself with the godhead. The harmony of the proportions conforms to cos- mic laws. Transcendental and earthly, spiritual and sensual world have become one. The Pantheon in its space architecture is the symbol of a philos- ophy which leads to definite separation of earthly and heavenly spheres in Christianity. The space is sharply defined through the cupola and the cylindrical walls. They are only shells with a richly decorated inner surface. The Italic artistic intent, working only with space, has drawn the sphere of transcendency into its creation. The text is followed by a list of the illustrations, chosen by Helga von Heintze. She is also the author of the excellent Index (pp. 531-554). The main part, 4, on names and objects is preceded by shorter ones: i, ancient authors quoted; 2, ancient artists; 3, modern authors. CONCLUSION Despite the greatest admiration for the lifework of Kaschnitz, there are a few points which are not satisfactory to the reader. There are too many repetitions and variations of the same ideas. There is sometimes a lack of regard for chronology, literature and aesthetic values. There is too much contrasting of the characteristics of different periods in the same sentence so that the reader is confused about what belongs to which era. One may contrast this gigantic work with a modest volume which, however, is packed with information and stimulation: Karl Schefold, R6mische Kunst als religi6ses Phdnomen, Ro- wohlts deutsche Enzyklopdidie, (Reinbeck bei Hamburg 1964). Here we find form, subject mat- ter (Inhalt) and spiritual content (Gehalt), in historical sequence with ample use of contemporary literary sources, all discussed in a crystal clear style. Schefold deals equally with all periods, in- cluding that between the Julio-Claudian and late antiquity, which Kaschnitz neglects. Schefold characterizes this period as transparent, in contrast to the earlier illusionistic and later transcendent styles. One may call his style transparent, while that of Kaschnitz is transcendent. The new edi- tion of Die Antike in the Propylden Kunstge- schichte by Rodenwaldt, entrusted to Schefold, may attain the ideal of transparency, transmitting rays of light without diffusion so that bodies be- hind may be distinctly seen. Anyone who has read these volumes by Kasch- nitz slowly and in part repeatedly, as this reviewer has done, will find that one's earlier knowledge of ancient art has not only been supplemented but also deepened and sharpened by new points of view. Like Arnold von Salis (Kunst der Griechen, I919) before him, Kaschnitz has really penetrated into fundamental principles and has grasped pre- cise ideas behind the phenomena, the objects of direct perception, of Greek and Roman art. The study of his work, therefore, is difficult but re- warding. It contains valuable information and stimulation for any scholar interested in art theo- ries, portraiture, or in the civilization of any of the countries around the Mediterranean. It is a rare event, when the heritage of an emi- nent scholar is published by such a group of dis- tinguished colleagues. The publishing house is also to be congratulated on the fine printing of this important book. NEW YORK</page></plain_text>
