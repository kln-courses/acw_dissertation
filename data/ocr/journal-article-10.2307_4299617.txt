<plain_text><page sequence="1">115 EXCAVATIONS AT BABA JAN, 1967: Second Preliminary Report By Clare Goff The second season's excavations at Bdbd Janl began on July 26th 1967, and continued for ten weeks. As before, the work was sponsored by the University of London, Institute of Archaeology, and directed by the writer. The team consisted of Miss Kay Wright (senior field assistant and photographer), Mr. Robin Dennell, Mr. Hugh Chapman and Mr. Roy Dyckhoff (field assistants), Mr. George Learmouth (surveyor and conservationist), and Miss Jennifer Davison (pottery assistant and registrar). Miss Wright also took charge of the field " first-aid post ", and Mr. Dyckhoff of the accounts. Mr. Mohammed Sarraf, as representative of the Iranian Department of Antiquities, gave invaluable help with the interpretation, drawing and driving, and Agha Heyder from Takht-e-Jamshid once again acted as foreman. My husband, Mr. Price Meade, was able to spend some days helping us at the end of the season. Most of the pottery and small finds were afterwards drawn in Tehran by Mr. Alan Bates and Mr. Richard Jones. Thanks are also owed to Mr. Pourmand, Director General of the Iranian Archaeological Service, the local authorities of Khorramdbad, and Agha Jazayeri of Khorramabad and Agha Sharifi of Nfirabtd, who gave invaluable local help. The excavations were financed by grants from the British Academy; the Institute of Archaeology, London; the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and the City Museums of Bolton and Birmingham. The personal expenses of the writer while on the dig, and on surveys connected with it, were met by a grant from the Wainwright Trust, Oxford. THE EXCAVATIONS Work was carried on in five areas (Site Plan, Fig. I). On the Central Mound we completed the excavation of the two " Fortified Manors " discovered the previous season (Trenches H to L); a 10 X IO m. sounding was made to the south-west of these buildings on the ridge connecting the Central Mound to the Islamic grave yard (Trench Z2); and the deep sounding in Trench F was carried down to a depth of just over 6 m. below the summit of the tepe when it became unsafe to continue. On the East Mound, last year's stepped trench was enlarged at its eastern end (Trench A) to obtain more information about Levels v and iv, and a deep sounding was made on the summit of the mound (Trench B) to elucidate the later part of the sequence. Finally three small trenches, P, Q and R, which have not yet been surveyed into the plan, were dug into the saddle separating the two mounds to ascertain the nature of the occupation in this area. As it is obviously impossible to describe all these operations in a single preliminary report, this year's account will be confined to the Iron II architecture and associated finds. The Fortified Manors Level 2 (Figs. 2 and 3) The eastern half of Level 2 was much better preserved than the western sector which we had excavated in 1966. Several of the walls, notably those surrounding the East Long Room, and the South-East and North Towers, were reused in Level I and had their mud brick superstructure preserved for several courses (Section, Fig. 5a and b). The average height of one of these courses was I4 to 15 cm. with about 5 cm. of mortar between the bricks, which were either orange-brown or grey. 1 For the previous season's excavations, see C. Goff Meade, " LiiristSn in the First Half of the First Millennium B.c.: A preliminary report on the first season's excavations at Babd 11A Jan, and associated surveys in the Eastern Pish-i-Kfih ", Iran VI (1968), pp. 1o5-34; henceforward referred to as Goff Meade, " LfiristAn ", Iran VI.</page><page sequence="2">116 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Fig. I. Plan of Babd Jan showing excavated areas 1966 and 1967.</page><page sequence="3">EXCAVATIONS AT BABA JAN, 1967 117 The completed plan shows a compact, symmetrical building, with a Central Court or Hall,2 flanked to the east and west by two long rectangular rooms, and surrounded on the four sides and corners by eight smaller rooms, which probably continued upwards in the form of towers. The overall dimensions of the building were 33 x 35 m., with the West Long Room, Hall and East Long Room measuring 18-6o x4'4o m., 186o x 96o m. and 17 4 x 5 20 m. respectively. The building was entered through the Central Tower in the east wall. The entrance was paved with large flag stones and probably had a mud-brick bench at either side against the wall,3 where guards, or those seeking audience with the local chief could wait until summoned. From there one entered the East Long Room over a stone threshold. This room, like the entrance, was also partially paved and had benches along the far wall. If the Central Hall was roofed at this period, this room may have served as an ante-chamber, and the main audience have taken place beyond. It seems fairly certain that the West Long Room was primarily domestic in function, since it contained a large quern and several storage vessels. Level i (Figs. 3 and 4) The excavation of the eastern section of this building has enabled us to gauge more accurately its relationship to the earlier Manor of Level 2. As the composite plan (Fig. 3) will show, any one of three procedures could be adopted by the builders: either the Level 2 plan could be completely ignored, the walls stripped to their foundations, and the Level i rooms laid out on a totally new plan, as in the west front; or, the Level 2 foundations could be stripped and be incorporated into the foundations of the Level I walls, as in the area surrounding the West Long Room; or, finally the Level 2 walls could be retained and left standing, either alone, as in the South East Tower, or with Level I walls built up against them, as with much of the centre and east of the building. In this last case, the Level I found- ations often start at a slightly higher level than those from Level 2 and also slightly overlap them. This suggests that, as in contemporary mud-brick structures, the lower sections of the Level 2 walls had been partially eaten away and must consequently have been left standing for some time before the rebuilding took place. The dual origin of the walls in this area also clears up a point that puzzled us last year-the apparently flimsy character of the northern and eastern walls of the Central Hall.4 The final plan of Level i is essentially that of Level 2 with certain important modifications. The tripartite division of the central area into a Hall flanked by two Long Rooms is retained, and, as described in the earlier report, the Hall was now definitely roofed in with a double row of columns down the centre.5 The main entrance still lay to the east of the building, but the Central Tower had been abolished in favour of a long rectangular Portico with a small guard room at the northern end. The front of this Portico was almost certainly lined by a row of columns but unfortunately the whole of the south-east end had been destroyed by an intrusive horse burial, and we only found evidence for two stone supports, one definite and one possible (Fig. 4, Nos. XI and XII). This elaborate arrangement of Portico, Long Room and Hall reinforces the parallels drawn last year between Level I and Burned Building III at IHasanlfi,6 and leads one to speculate again on the nature and purpose of the pair of buttresses in the west wall of the Hall. This was originally interpreted as a doorway, both because of the presence of a door-socket, and on analogy with a similar arrangement in Level vb on the East Mound (below, p. 126). This left unexplained the hearth directly in front of the entrance, and the discrepancies in height between this floor level of the Hall and the much higher one of the Long Room beyond, to which the door socket corresponded. In the IHasanlfi IV Burned Buildings, the centre of the wall immediately opposite the main entrance was invariably occupied by a bench and 2 Further excavations were carried out this season on the original Level 2 floor of the Hall, without producing definite evidence for post holes earlier than what is taken to be the earliest phase of Level I. The possibility that this may just conceivably be a late phase of 2 is discussed below on pp. 120--1. 3 This tower was destroyed in Level I, except for the stone paving which was reused. The location of benches, here, as in the East Long Room, is deduced from the sudden gap between the stone flooring and wall, which, in each case, was filled with a slight bricky fill, suggesting a bricky superstructure. 4 Goff Meade, " Lfiristdn ", Iran VI, p. x 5. 5 Goff Meade, " Lfiristan ", Iran VI, p.

If there had been a mud brick platform between the two buttresses, this could have served both as a bench on which the chief could sit while conducting business, and at the same time a step to the high threshold over which he could retire to his private apartments.

Certainly it lies below the level of the top of the Level I stone foundations in contrast to the structures of this period on the East Mound, where the Level vb wall foundations are invariably sunk into a trench. However this seems unlikely in view of the fact that the column bases, which undoubtedly go with this floor, also line up with the Level I buttresses and with stones set along the sides of the Level I walls which must have supported pilasters. The remaining modifications to the Level 2 plan can be dealt with fairly rapidly. As described last year, the towers along the west front were replaced by a buttressed Alcove, matching the eastern Portico. Elsewhere they were either incorporated into the Level I structure as side rooms; replaced by bigger units, such as the Long Room to the south, or possibly, as on the north east corner, rebuilt on a more massive scale. This, at any rate, seems to be the most likely explanation for the impossibly small rooms in this area with their massive stone partitions. These foundations, though lying c. I m. below the surface of the tepe, had no mud brick superstructure, and several large querns, obviously of later 8 Traces of a high floor were found at the northern end of the Hall associated with a hearth and short secondary stretch of walling. Many of the better preserved small finds, including a bronze bowl, were also found at this level, just under the plough soil, but it is impossible to tell whether they were associated with a high, eroded floor, or part of a fallen upper storey or roof.</page><page sequence="8">122 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES date, lay directly above them. The mud-brick superstructure of the south wall of the Portico was equally amorphous, whereas that of the adjoining Level 2 wall seems to have been preserved to a higher level (Section, Fig. 5). There is, therefore, just the possibility that the reconstruction at this end of the building was never completed, but one cannot be certain about this when so much erosion has obviously taken place. Two further problems remain to be settled, both connected with the entrance. One is the date and purpose of the wall (Fig. 3, Level " 2a ") which runs straight across the east front of the manors. This is certainly later than Level 2 since it cuts the foundations of the Entrance Tower. Its relationship to Level I is ambiguous. On the one hand it appears just to underly the eastern end of the Portico's north wall, and its mud-brick superstructure also underlies what is assumed to be the stone base for a column (XII).9 On the other hand its stone foundations do not run under the better established stone base of column XI suggesting that this column may already have been in existence at the time the wall was built. An alternative, and perhaps easier theory, would regard it as a low step or bench, built at the same time as Level I and running along the whole of the front of the building as a narrow plinth. But if this is so, then what are we to make of the walls running off it ? Level 2a apart, there is the final problem of how the entrance was reached from the surrounding fields. The main doorway overlooks the steepest side of the mound which is here scoured by a slight dent, or gully, clearly visible in the contour map (Fig. I). Was the deliberate angling of the building to face the most difficult route of access a defensive measure ? And does the gully mark the position of an earlier ramp or staircase ? Apart from the buildings, the Central Mound produced two further very unexpected discoveries: an anthropomorphic vase, and a horse burial with accompanying grave goods. The Anthropomorphic Vase The painted vessel in the shape of a man (P1. IIIa, b) is the first of its kind to be recovered in situ in Liiristmn, although at least three other examples are known from private collections. One of these, an example from the collection of Mr. James Bomford, is illustrated here for comparative purposes (P1. IIIc).10 The BTbh Jtn figure stands 20- 7 cm. high and is 13- I cm. wide and 9 -o cm. thick across the hips. It is made of the same buff clay as the rest of the pottery from these levels" with burnished surface and brown painted decoration. The painting makes little attempt to represent clothes, but merely depicts a typical " kite and ring " design around the body. Only on the head is there the suggestion of a cap, or hair, and on the feet, possibly laced boots with curled up toes. The body is squat with exaggeratedly wide hips and legs which contrast with its tiny forearms, and schematic, inhuman head, in which eyes and ears are represented by applied clay buttons. The male sexual organs are suggested in a similar fashion. The jar which it clutches to its chest was broken in antiquity, but was presumably similar in shape to that carried by the example from the Bomford collection. The Bomford figure is perhaps slightly more naturalistically rendered, although the face has an odd resemblance to a bear (a phenomenon also to be seen in the Marlik figures of the same class)."2 In this as in the other two known examples, the body is oval, without the widely exaggerated hips, the arms have the same squat proportions as the rest of the body, and, as they hold the jar away from the face, must also serve as spouts. There also seems to have been more attempt to represent clothing, though, again, many of the motifs used can be paralleled on the other pottery. The figure appears to wear a tunic or coat, with high collar and long sleeves, below which are striped leggings and the usual pointed shoes. The shape of the head may be intended to suggest some form of peaked cap. 9 The bricks from this wall are normally squarish, and about 13-15 cm. thick. The sizes obtained are as follows: 34 x 34 cm.; 36 X 37 cm.; 38 x 17 cm. (half brick); I8 x 40 cm. (half brick). 10 The writer wishes to express her gratitude to Mr. James Bomford for allowing her to study his collection and for the photograph reproduced here. A better reproduction of the Bomford figure is contained in Antiquities from the Bomford Collection (Exhibition Catalogue, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford 1966), no. 28o, pl. xxiii.

In one example however most of the painted decoration-not in any case very extensive- seems to have worn away, while the other is unpainted. This last example carries a typical Liristan vessel with attached beak spout ornamented by large bosses.14 The closest parallels for these anthropomorphic vessels occur at Marlik,15 but here they are executed in a somewhat more vigorous style and in a far greater number of poses. Besides the man carrying a jug, there are women,16 warriors,17 and seated " bears ",18 suggesting that the idea possibly originated at Marlik, and reached the south-west in a conventionalized form, possibly through the medium of .Hasanli, with whose Iron II pottery the " genre Ltirist~n " wares are undoubtedly connected.19 The Horse Burial The first traces of the horse burial were discovered when, in cleaning down the north face of the H-L baulk, our foreman uncovered the side of a bronze bowl which was only just visible. A guard was left in charge that evening, and the next morning the baulk was removed, revealing the well-preserved skeleton of a horse, accompanied by a small but interesting collection of grave-goods (P1. IIc and Figs. 6 and 7). The horse was presumably buried in a pit which appears to have been dug into the eastern edge of the stone paving of the entrance, just south of the main axis. The skeleton was surrounded by a hard bricky deposit, but no actual tomb structure could be recovered, though the shallowness of the pit makes a superstructure likely. The burial had disturbed the Level 2-1 paving and would also have obstructed the main entrance. It may therefore be assumed to be intrusive. The corpse (P1. IIc and Fig. 6a) had apparently been thrown into the grave and weighted down with stones. It lay on its back with the right hind cannon bone pointing upwards and the left hind doubled up with the cannon bone pointing towards the head. The head and forequarters had been twisted round so that the skull faced south with the neck upright as if it had rested against the side of the grave. The forelegs were stretched out in front. On the dismantling of the skeleton (Fig. 6b), a bronze nose plate (Fig. 7: 3) was discovered lying under the horse's left shoulder. Beneath it lay a very corroded iron bit (Fig. 7: 5), and five looped harness studs (Fig. 7: 4) were scattered in the immediate vicinity, with traces of the harness straps as impressions in the surrounding soil. Not far from the hind-quarters were the bronze bowl (Fig. 7: I) and a large bronze lamp (Fig. 7: 2). Horse graves have otherwise been found in Iran at Godin Tepe, where the burial was associated with a second millennium tomb, 20 and at Hasanlil,21 where four horses were buried in the upper part of a tomb on the lower level of which lay a human skeleton. A horse's skull was also buried on the East Mound probably in a sixth-seventh century context, but just possibly intrusive. The attribution of the manors to the ninth and eighth centuries22 gives us a terminus post quem for the Central Mound burial, which must otherwise be dated internally. Most of the objects found with the skeleton have parallels from other sites of the late ninth to the early seventh centuries, suggesting that though intrusive, the burial may belong to the period directly following the abandonment of the manors, when such occupation as there was on the site had shifted to the East Mound. The nose plate can perhaps be compared to more elaborate ivory examples from 13 Cf. note Io. 14 G. Contenau and R. Ghirshman, Fouilles du Tipd Giyan pris de NdVhavend, 1931 et 1932 (Paris I935), pl.

Grave goods from the horse burial on the Central Mound.</page><page sequence="16">126 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Nimrtid dated by Mallowan to the first half of the eighth century,23 and to rather similar early seventh century examples from the chariot burials at Salamis.24 These ivory nose pieces are larger and more nearly triangular than the Bdbd Jan example but the Nimrtid ones have a similar row of holes at the broader end, presumably for attachment to a leather backing. Unpublished bronze examples from the early seventh century were also found at Salamis, together with frontlets of leather with a thin coating of gold from the eighth, and these may eventually give us an even closer parallel. It is noticeable that the Bdbd Jan nose plate was not accompanied by a set of blinkers or cheek pieces such as were found both in the Salamis graves and among the Nimrfid ivories.25 Bridle bosses also occur at Nimrid26 and at HasanlGi IV as well as in the undated horse burial of Rad and Hakemi's excavations27 but appear to be of a different type to the Bdbd Jdn ones. The bit is perhaps more significant. Although too corroded to allow us to see the details of its construction, it appears to have a twisted, jointed snaffle, circular rein rings, and separate cheek pieces. Whether these were pierced like the rather similar examples from Sialk, Necropolis B,28 or had small loops attached to the side corresponding to the blobs of corrosion remains uncertain. Finally, the bronze lamp has been compared to an example from Grave 30 at Assur which also contains a bowl inscribed with the name of Assur-taklaku.29 An official of that name was eponym for the year 805 B.c. in Assur, but, as the grave also contains an elbow fibula of a type which apparently first occurs in the seventh century and continues to the fifth, a slightly later dating for the tomb is indicated.30 The East Mound Our excavations this season have given us a much clearer idea of the buildings in Level vb, which must be approximately contemporary with the " Manors ", and the slightly later " squatting levels " of va and iv.31 As can be seen from the site plan (Fig. I), the west end of the deep sounding, which in 1966 was excavated only as far as Level iv,32 was continued down to virgin soil, and then the whole 13 m. of this trench (A) extended 4 m. to the north (D, F). Meanwhile the original deep sounding was extended 5 m. to the south (C). In the lowest level, vb (Fig. 8), the solid mud-brick wall, which in 1966 was discovered running along the northern edge of the deep sounding, can now be seen to form the partition between a large room and an open courtyard, both still imperfectly excavated. The stone structure in the south-east corner of the 1966 deep sounding,33 originally thought to be a phase of Level vb, can now be shown to rest directly on the Level vb floor and to belong to the earliest of the Level va rebuildings. The only original features of the courtyard, which had at least two floor levels of greenish tamped clay, were the stone paving in front of the doorway to the west of the trench, and three post holes, which do not seem to form a sufficiently coherent pattern to imply the existence of a roof. The room to the north, dubbed the " Painted Chamber " on account of its colourful interior decoration, was entered through an elaborately plastered and buttressed doorway (P1. IVa). The floor level of the Chamber lay some 20 cm. lower than that of the courtyard, and on the inner side of the doorway was a step made by fixing a wooden beam-later burnt-over a layer of pebbles. To the east was a small clay door socket, and the area just beyond the entrance showed traces of charring as if a burnt wooden door had fallen inwards. 23 M. E. L.

The north face of the wall showed traces of red plaster which extended only a few centimetres up the face of the wall before ending in a line of burning. This line seemed to coincide with a layer of burnt bricky material that may be interpreted as a patch of fallen roofing clay. The most striking discovery in this room, however, was the fragments of up to forty-three complete or nearly complete painted tiles of a type so far unique in the Ancient Orient.34 These tiles were found either standing on edge, or tilting with the north side up, south side down, indicating that they had fallen from a higher level-the top of the walls, ceiling or upper storey. Fragments of the plaster " backing " with which they must have been attached to the building can be seen very clearly in section. 4 Glazed tiles are found in Elam at Chogha Zanbil from the reign of Untash GAL (c. 1265-45) and at Susa from that of Shutruk Nahunte (c. 1207-1171); E. Porada, Ancient Irah (London 1965), p. 116. They also occur in the Iron II period at IHasanlfi IV, ibid., pp. 68-9; R. H. Dyson, " Problems of Proto-historic Iran as seen from IHasanlii ", JNES XXIV (1965), p. 199 and note ii. In this case, however, the tiles follow the Mesopotamian models in having a hollow centre which fits over a wooden peg, and examples from Elam seem to have been attached in a similar fashion. The Babdt Jan tiles seem to represent an independent local development, though the pottery designs from Sialk, Necropolis B which parallel them closely, suggest that similar methods of decoration could be found elsewhere in the Zagros at this period did one but know where to look.</page><page sequence="18">128 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Otherwise, as with the manors on the Central Mound, there was very little in the way of pottery or any other finds on the floor at all, suggesting that the Chamber and the courtyard had been cleared out and abandoned before the conflagration. The Tiles The tiles are made of buff clay with large crushed rock inclusions. The underside is left rough, but the outer surface is self slipped and hard smoothed. The paint, as on the pottery, is usually brick red, but darker overfired examples also occur. Their dimensions are fairly standard. With one or two exceptions the length falls between 46-3 and 47'3 cm., the width between 41 .o and 42-o cm. and the thickness averages 6 - o cm. with a range of 4* 8 to 7 . o cm. As can be seen from the sections (Fig. 9) they are slightly concave with a hollow face. Most came from the floor of the " Painted Chamber " itself but a few fragments were found scattered throughout our excavations in this area. The designs so far fall into three main groups. Most common are arrangements in which a central, approximately square panel, is divided by a cross into four quarters which are then filled in with subsidiary motifs. In the " Standard " design, which occurs by far the most frequently, the central cross is white with a red centre, and the corners are filled by a simple arrangement of concentric red and white squares (P1. IVd). Also fairly common is the " Reverse " where the central cross is red, and the corner design made slightly more complex by the addition of an extra red rectangle (P1. IVc). In both examples the central cross is picked out with rows of dots. In the rarer and elaborate " Chequer Board " designs, the corners are filled in with a small panel of sixteen red and white squares, surrounded by one or more bands of dots (Fig. 9: 3). In the second sub-group, the " Nine Squares ", the cruciform framework is abandoned in favour of one which divides the central rectangle into nine equal squares. Each of these is then filled by a solid or open rectangle surrounded by a band of dots (P1. IVb; Fig. 9: I); or, if our reconstruction in Fig. 9: 2 is correct, by small chequer boards. Finally in the third sub-group, the rectangular framework is abandoned. A broad " St. Andrew's Cross " is painted across the centre, and the four triangles between the arms are filled by groups of three small squares with dotted borders. This group of designs, although the most interesting, are the least carefully executed of the three, and in certain cases the painter seems to have deliberately intro- duced irregularities and asymmetrical effects (P1. IVe, f; Fig. 9: 4)-very much as the modern tribal rug makers do today. As for the derivation of these designs; the " Nine Squares " and " St. Andrew's Cross " so far have no exact parallels.35 The first group however, seem to have as their basis the second millennium " Kassite Cross " which also occurs on the pottery.36 Moreover, both the " Reverse " and " Chequer Board " arrangements have close parallels on the pottery of Sialk, Necropolis B,37 thus strengthening the connections between the two sites which was already becoming evident after the first season.38 Thus as the result of our second season we have further evidence that Bbab Jan was an important local centre in about the eighth century B.C., and that the inhabitants of first millennium Lfiristdn were not merely nomadic warriors but had a well developed and distinctive culture of which the notorious bronzes are but one aspect. That this was due to artistic inventiveness rather than isolation is shown by the connections with the rich contemporary cultures of Solduz, Marlik and Kdshmn. It is hoped that our third season of excavations will uncover more of the unique " Painted Chamber " and establish its relationship to the other largely untouched levels on the summit of the East Mound. 35 c" St. Andrew's Crosses " occur occasionally on both " genre Lfiristin " and Sialk, Necropolis B pottery, but in neither case is the parallel very close.
