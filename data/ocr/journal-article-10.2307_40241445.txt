<plain_text><page sequence="1">Narrative Elements A New Common Feature Between the Sciences of Nature and the Sciences of Societies Mauro Ceruti history of modern science has not been the gradual explora- tion of a cosmos whose fundamental traits had already been dis- covered and described at the beginning, in the seventeenth century. Newton's universe is not the universe of Copernicus. Poincare's uni- verse is not Laplace's universe. Darwin's universe is not Lyell's. And above all, Darwin's universe is not the universe of Newton. The ex- ploration of deep space and deep time is not a series of successive chapters within a single line of development: it instead consists of scenes in which divergent and discordant concepts, world views, metaphysical theories, and cosmologies emerged and were applied. The sciences which study the evolution of life have elaborated view- points, techniques, and cosmologies that could not be directly de- rived from those which had ensured the successful exploration of the celestial orbits. Until quite recently, the differences between these two worlds as well as the different types of rational knowledge which supported, on the one hand, the success of the Copernican-Galileian-Newtonian revolution, and on the other the success of Darwin's revolution have been neglected, if not completely ignored. Because of this, the de- velopment of the life sciences has been regulated by the following assumptions: in nature there are regularities unlimited either in space or in time; these regularities can be extrapolated in all time and space (with all conditions being equal); these regularities do not change; science has the task to express these regularities as natural laws; natural laws are the privileged objective of science, and must be obtained independently of the particular context; from these laws it review, xxii, 1, 1999, 1-15 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Mauro Ceruti is necessary to derive quantitative and computable mathematical formulations. In addition, this perspective reinforces the conviction that there exists a normal trajectory of the universe, valid for both past and future, and that science has access to it. It therefore pro- duces a reconstruction of the past which favors determinism and reg- ularities, and which filters, absorbs, and expels contingencies; and this reconstruction becomes in turn the model for understanding the future. The regulating power of these assumptions has not only slowed a full development of the historical and evolutionary sciences, but has also stifled the potential of the dialogue between inorganic and life sciences, and has made Darwin's viewpoint less interesting to the viewpoint of Newton's inheritors. At the same time we still have not calculated the loss of opportunity that this has brought to the episte- mology of the emerging social sciences. In the second half of our century, however, our conception of evolution and natural history has been profoundly changed by some surprises and some changes in perspective, which allow us fully to comprehend the radical newness of the Darwinian world picture compared to Newton's. These transformations are at the same time fully consonant with the radical changes of perspective brought about in the field of the physical and chemical sciences by the works of Ilya Prigogine. The weight of this new alliance between evolution- ary biology and the prigoginian approach still needs to be measured, but we can already affirm that it could turn out to be a decisive factor in the renovation of the social sciences and, in a more general way, of the images of history and of the future of our species. One of the issues through which we can best measure the extent of the conceptual changes happening today is that of our place in nature, that human species which Darwin's proposed new concept of life had implicitly dethroned. It is certainly not surprising that the question of the human species' role in evolution, during the first few decades that followed the publication of The Origin of Species, caused embarrassments and uneasy silence. Darwin explicitly considered it fully inserted in the evolutionary process, and therefore generated by the same mechanisms and descendant from the same "common ancestor" as all the other species. However, he let many years pass before publishing his ideas on the subject, waiting for the vision generated by The Origin of Species to consolidate itself. Other evolu- tionists, with Alfred Russell Wallace among them, attempted instead</page><page sequence="3">NARRATIVE ELEMENTS 3 to remove the human species from the existence shared by all the other species, considering it to be an exception more or less tran- scendental in origin. Soon, however, a spectacular reversal of perspective occurred. The image of natural selection's slow scrutiny, which tirelessly pre- serves and spreads the "fittest" organisms, and the idea of adapta- tion, according to which all of an organism's traits and behavioral patterns spring from an optimal project, made up the nucleus of a rhetoric which conceived the human species as the best and most evolved product of the evolutionary melting pot. During the course of most of the Darwinian tradition's developments selection and adaptation have been seen as concepts with which one could ex- haustively determine the normal trajectory against which facts could be judged and controversies could be diffused. The presence of Homo sapiens would therefore guarantee that this world is the in- evitable result of a great calculation, in which species are created only at the opportune moment when natural selection has com- pleted all the necessary and sufficient steps for their existence. The changes in evolutionary biology over the last few years- a large part of which are centered around a challenge to the tradi- tional ideas of selection and adaptation- have certainly not spared the issue of the placement of the human species. On the contrary they have brought it to the foreground, because they have increased the reinterpretations of many fundamental episodes in the long evo- lutionary line which leads to Homo sapiens, starting with his most remote ancestors. A first decisive conceptual turning point involves the events in the biosphere during a very remote past. This is the time of the so- called Cambrian explosion (around 530 million years ago), during which, in the space of a few million years, there emerged in the plan- et's oceans what we can consider to be the prototypes for all of today's animal organisms: the different organizational plans, of which the single species constitute a sort of variation on the theme. The great surprise of the last few decades is that research on the Cambrian explosion has proved wrong a deeply instilled image of evolution: that of an inverted cone, with a single-point vortex (the remote past in which the common ancestor to all animal organiza- tional plans originated) and widening progressively until the base (the present). This cone represents the evolution of animal life as a progressive diversification of forms and organizational plans devel-</page><page sequence="4">4 Mauro Ceruti oping from simpler and less differentiated ancestors. On the con- trary, research on the Cambrian explosion has led to the discovery that during the Middle Cambrian all the animal organizational plans which exist today were already present; that since then no new or- ganizational plans have been created; that furthermore there existed then many other organizational plans which no longer exist today; and that they became extinct only a few million years later. The evo- lution of the animal world appears as a highly elaborate interweaving of diversification and standardization. This is well expressed by the new image of the bush: the tree of life is able to generate lush flower- ings, but is subject to severe prunings at the same time. Perhaps some organizational plans did not unfold further because they were less adaptable (in the Darwinian sense) than those which survived. But precious little in the fossil record at our disposal leads us to be inclined to such a conjecture. On the contrary, such fossil records emphasize the role of contingency: it is probable that the extinct or- ganizational plans did not survive simply because their component species were the victims of local catastrophes which had nothing to do with their overall suitability. The particular history of our own lin- eage fully confirms such a vision. In the Middle Cambrian strata the organizational plan of the Cord√¢tes (to which Homo sapiens be- longs, along with all the vertebrates, and even some other types of marine animals) is represented by a single species, Pikaia Gracilens. It is not only small and hardly noticeable, but also relatively rare: much less widespread than both species belonging to organizational plans still in existence today, and species belonging to organizational plans which vanished soon after. There is no clue that might enable us to judge Pikaia superior or better adapted to the Cambrian eco- systems than many species contemporary to it which met the inexo- rable pruning: on the contrary, our remote origins seem to unques- tionably bear the imprint of a lucky throw of the cosmic dice. A second conceptual turning point relates to the events of a much more recent time on the geological scale: the boundary be- tween Mesozoic and Cenozoic, roughly 65 million years ago. This time, too, is witness to an event of great importance for our own lineage: the extinction of the dinosaurs, as a result of which many niches in the terrestrial biosphere became suddenly vacant, granting mammals a virtually immediate evolutionary branching out and di- versification, and in addition allowing the origin of primates. In the last twenty years the increasingly substantial confirmations of the hy-</page><page sequence="5">NARRATIVE ELEMENTS 5 pothesis that the extinction of the dinosaurs would be the most dra- matic consequence of a global biosphere crisis, produced by the im- pact of an extraterrestrial body, have virtually reversed the meaning of the mammal/ dinosaur relationship. The evolutionary branching out of mammals has nothing to do with a victory over the dinosaurs or even with an abstract superiority of theirs. Rather it depends on a singularity, on a discontinuous mutation of the rules of the game in a biosphere which had long been static, in which the dinosaurs, for roughly 100 million years, had prevailed and mammals had been confined to marginal and low-profile niches. Without the impact of the celestial body, it is possible that these rules of the game would have endured up to the present day, or that they might even have allowed the emergence of a sort of intelligence in reptilian form, alternative to our own mammal/primate/hominid type. The remote history of Homo sapiens seems, therefore, to indicate that our species, far from being the apex of a preordained project, is the product of an exceptionally positive fate. Paleontologists themselves point out that during the Permian, 245 million years ago (and there- fore 180 million years before the evolutionary branching out of mammals started), the biosphere was already populated by many types of reptiles which had protomammalian characteristics. But all save one fell victim in the worst mass extinction that history remem- bers. Perhaps the evolutionary branching out of mammals, with a little luck, could have occurred even in such remote times; perhaps the probability of such an occurrence is equal to the probability of a biosphere still dominated by reptiles today. This way, the species Homo sapiens would carry inside itself the seeds of both bad and good fate, and of evolutionary accelerations and regressions. But in any case it is the entanglement of histories and circumstances which becomes constantly stratified, each time in innovative configurations, and which cannot be distilled into any abstract optimization calcula- tion. A third, equally intense change in perspective is tied to the recent past (on a geological scale) of Homo sapiens: the hominization proc- ess, from its most remote stages (the splitting away of the hominid branch from the adjacent branches of anthropomorphic apes) to those more recent (the speciation process which gave rise to Homo sapiens, with all probability also linked to the birth of language as we know it today). These evolutionary developments are also marked by crises, discontinuities, rejections, sudden alternations of rhythm, and</page><page sequence="6">6 Mauro Ceruti show nothing similar to a gradual, forward triumphal march. In the first place, hominization in its entirety coincides with a global crisis of the biosphere: in the last few million years our planet has under- gone a strong cooling process, which has led to the establishment of a permanent glacial cover over the Antarctic continent as well as the global climatic fluctuations which have repeatedly altered every con- tinent's ecosystem. As a result of this, the great evolutionary branch- ing out of the mammals, which had begun rolling at the time of the disappearance of the dinosaurs, has been greatly slowed, if not com- pletely stalled. In fact, the last few million years have witnessed the extinction of many species of mammals of every order, which have vastly preceded the present destructive effect of the human species over the world of the living. Secondly, the overall cooling of the biosphere has, among its many local ramifications, also strongly altered the African rainforest, which is the traditional habitat of the anthropomorphic apes from which the hominid branch arose. Above all, it resulted in a strong reduction of its expansion in favor of the ecosystem of the savannah, which until then had been relatively marginal. At the moment of their emergence, the hominids are representatives of a declining group (during the last few million years the total number of species of anthropomorphic apes has been greatly reduced in comparison to that of other ape groups) which had to face a critical transformation of their original ecosystems. Furthermore, they found themselves almost entirely cut off from those areas in which the forest still reigned after the deepening of the geological fault in the Rift Valley, which was filled by the great lakes. Even the successive phases of hominid development do not cor- roborate in the least the traditional image of a development headed towards a final goal. On the contrary, again the image of a bush is more fitting than that of a cone: repeatedly, several hominid species existed at the same time (although perhaps in different habitats); and repeatedly this blossoming was cut short by severe prunings. Homo sapiens is in this sense the fruit of a small side branch, and not the product of a comfortable main avenue. The majority of the hominid species shows, in addition, a very strong stability even over impres- sively long timespans. For example, the skeletons of Homo erectus, our direct ancestor, show hardly any significant mutations for hun- dreds of thousands of years, and above all no sign of directed evolu- tion which might herald the tendencies that will characterize the new</page><page sequence="7">NARRATIVE ELEMENTS 7 Homo sapiens. The latter, in all probability, is instead the result of a very rapid specialization process, which occurred in a small popula- tion within the ancestral species. At the end of this century a network of multiple and diverse approaches within many disciplines has developed, such as genetics, linguistics, archeology, anthropology, ethnology, zoology, botany, climatology, ecology, comparative studies in mythology and religion. This network aims to reconstruct the great phases and scenarios of the populating of the planet by our species, starting precisely from its African origins and arriving at its present condition of planetary species spread over every continent, established steadfastly even in ecosystems which were not conceivable on the basis of the possibili- ties originally available to the branch of the anthropomorphic apes. It is important to note that the analysis of the crucial developments in this history- the history of Homo sapiens proper- seems to reso- nate with the new interpretations of many remote episodes of natu- ral history. The convergence consists of giving increasingly greater weight to circumstance and narration, being suspicious of the explana- tory omnipotence of single causes of an adaptive nature, and un- masking the introverted logic found in the rhetorical mechanism, which tends to read the past solely through the eyes of the winners of today. Research into the origins of agriculture, for example, is emblem- atic of this shift in perspective, as it tackles the question of why, dur- ing the last ten thousand years, the agricultural societies should have supplanted the traditional societies of hunter-gatherers all over the planet. Until quite recently, it was routine to search for the cause or causes conceived to be necessary and sufficient to explain the advan- tages that agricultural societies would have inevitably enjoyed over hunter-gatherer societies. Even more drastically, the prejudicial op- position of values which was implicit in placing hunter-gatherer soci- eties before and agricultural societies after on a common timeline of progress tended to widen to include other parallel oppositions: no- madic and sedentary populations, populations with and without writ- ing, preurban and urban populations, populations with and without a state structure In this way the question of research into the ori- gins of civilization was reduced to outlining the essential traits of the Neolithic revolution, understood as a decisive founding break which would once and for all have separated the historic societies which emerged from the prehistoric societies that were now obsolete. But</page><page sequence="8">8 Mauro Ceruti in the last few years, the worth of this scheme has been strongly dis- puted. By contrast, there has appeared the variety of phenomenol- ogy adopted by the incipient types of agricultural societies. In point of fact, agriculture originated in many different (and very often independent) locations, at many different times, with different mech- anisms, and also with substantially different original animal and plant stocks. The resulting model, with a multiplicity of almost inde- pendent centers of origin connected however by various processes of interference, diffusion, and circulation, makes it impossible either to concentrate the Neolithic revolution into a single phase of human- ity's history or to elaborate an isomorphic vision of the various local groups, through which the transition from prehistoric to historic societies would follow the same stages everywhere, even if the time- lines were out of phase. In fact, many societies escape the simplifying dichotomy of hunting/gathering versus agriculture, and many mixed modes of production do not necessarily always evolve towards the goal of agriculture. Even the range of possible causes, in addition, has definitely increased, and the explanations based on great eco- nomic criteria, such as the feeding requirements of a population which for some reason is increasing, coexist with others based on cultural or even ritual criteria (the new cultivated food, the new herded animal as special sustenance for festivities, or for potlatch of a high social order). At times, in terms of production benefits, the shift to an agricultural mode of production even seems to result in a regression compared to the previous lifestyles: less food is obtained, or more time is needed to obtain the same amount of food. There arises the need for a case-by-case explanation, and the need to insert the question of the origins of agriculture both within the history of local ecosystem changes, and within the history of the relationship between the human populations and the varied animal and plant species belonging to these ecosystems. At times, agricul- ture is not a coherently pursued goal, but rather a collateral effect of the evolution of these relationships between man and nature. In the foreground, the single features of the ecosystems, the single animal species, and the single vegetable species stand out. It is not an indif- ferent matter that a human population should have found this or that animal species within its local ecosystem, since some animal spe- cies are easily domesticated, and others less so or not at all. It is not an indifferent matter that the first agricultural cultivations should have hinged on this or that particular range of plants, within this or</page><page sequence="9">NARRATIVE ELEMENTS 9 that local ecosystem: some plants are more easily cultivated than others, some have greater nutritional value than others, and so on. The geographical orientation of the continents is also not indiffer- ent: in Eurasia, which is mainly oriented horizontally (west to east), a cultivated plant can spread quickly over many thousands of kilome- ters, remaining roughly at the same latitude and therefore within a relatively stable set of climatic conditions; entirely different is the mainly vertical (north to south) orientation of the Americas, where a plant already finds noticeably different climatic conditions a few hundred kilometers away from its place of origin. Many episodes of human history are therefore a sort of crystallized contingency which depends on the singular interactions between populations and local ecosystems. Through its changes, its discontinuities, its twists and turns, and its apparent regressions, the trajectory of natural history therefore defines a huge variety of other possible histories, an entanglement of forks in the road and of irreversible choices. Inside this maze, con- tingency cannot be denied. Every choice becomes necessary only ex post facto, only after having been implemented. We very probably owe our existence to those unknown upheavals in the Cambrian seas which preserved Pikaia and kin from the inevitability of extinction, to the asteroid impact of 65 million years ago, and also to the plane- tary cooling of the last few million years. As Isabelle Stengers asserts: the renunciation of a finite and harmonious vision of the real world which we associate with Darwin, has not yielded the discovery of general laws and the possibility of judging phe- nomena according to them ... in this case nothing can allow us to disregard the diversity of situations and contingencies . . . Darwinian theory does not proceed by establishing general causality relationships, but by complicating ever further the reasons for evolution. It imposes on the biologist the explora- tion of a cause-and-effect maze, it expresses the need for multi- ple narrations which would reproduce, hypothetically, the manner in which a variable group of causes produced a frag- ment of evolution. The world discovered by Darwin is one in which reason cannot become the authority, in which the re- searcher becomes an investigator, unable to determine in advance what is significant and what can be ignored (Chertok &amp; Stengers, 1990:31).</page><page sequence="10">10 Mauro Ceruti Today, evolutionary biology is transforming itself precisely through a radical discussion of the unity of the scientific method. Its scenarios show the specific type of rational consciousness which is required to research life and history. In this way, they show the undi- minishable plurality and diversity of the types of rationality and the methods necessary for science to study different types of phenom- ena. In the words of Stephen Jay Gould, Many great areas in nature . . . must be studied with the histo- rian's tools. The appropriate methods concentrate on narration, and not on the experiment as it is habitually conceived His- torical explanations are in many respects different from con- ventional experimental results. The problem of verification through repetition does not arise, because we try to explain the uniqueness of particulars which can not reoccur, because of both the laws of probability and the irreversibility of the timeline. We do not attempt to interpret the complex events of historical nar- ration by reducing them to simple consequences of natural law; historical events do not violate, obviously, any general principle of matter or motion, but they occur within a set of contingent details And the problem of prediction, a central ingredient in the stereotype, is not part of historical narration. We can explain an event after its occurrence, but the contingency precludes its repetition, even when beginning from the same starting point (Gould, 1989: 284-85). The present biosphere, where the flowering of our species is at once creative and destructive, is at the tip of only one of many fragile branches which spread out from countless points. This tip consti- tutes the present, our privileged point of view from which we ob- serve and generate our pasts (in other words the other points along the branch at whose tip we find ourselves) and many other worlds, alternative but still open to our view. On the other branches are our counterpasts, our counterpresents and our counterfutures. Within the irreversible, open timeline of natural history, the insertion of human beings, members of a biological species which it- self participates in the flux of evolution, introduces a steadfast asym- metry between past and future, and therefore also between the counterpresents/counterpasts and the counterfutures which we can create with our imagination.</page><page sequence="11">NARRATIVE ELEMENTS 1 1 In relation to the present and past of the biosphere, the history of our species is irreversibly located on only one of the many con- ceivable branches. Naturally, our point of view can always be modi- fied: future discoveries, by radically transforming our knowledge, may, for example, reveal that certain characteristics of our present which we consider unique and unrepeatable might instead be shared by other branches, with other possible histories. We may well dis- cover fossils which predate the appearance of multicellular organ- isms on the earth, or perhaps fossils which would attest to a survival of the dinosaurs beyond the date for their extinction which we hold reliable. But it seems to us that we have understood the relationship between our temporal trajectory and the other conceivable branches. We, either individual or collective observers belonging to the human species, limited both in space and in time, decide to uphold our privileged world concept, and out of this act we generate hypotheti- cal alternative worlds (counterpasts and counterpresents) and we generate understanding through comparing these worlds. With respect to the future, such a strategy is not possible. If every moment of time in the biosphere is full of branchings, if the branching full of future potential occurs unpredictably, if it is even problematic to assert whether a branching would or would not be full of future potential (after all, in natural history every innovation is produced by many branchings, and it is not certain that these branchings can be defined or computed), then it makes little sense to isolate a privileged future within an ocean of conceivable counterfutures. Every possible future is a counterfuture, even if they are not all equally close to us: we consider some of these counterfutures more probable, and some less so. Or at least we can say that: whatever we might mean by calling our present real, actual, or genuine with respect to our counter-presents, as a cognitive act it cannot be extrapolated linearly to be applied to the near or distant future. Probability is not always the antechamber to reality. Reality is not always an unfolding of probability. It is even possible that, especially for certain scenarios which involve the well-being or the survival of the human species, what is ethically desirable should be more important than what is cognitively probable, and that our very decision to favor desirability would later on impact positively on the probability. If, for example, a set of future scenarios unconnected with the processes of ecologi- cal destruction currently under way (reduction of the tropical forests, extinction of animal species, greenhouse effect, etc.) should indicate</page><page sequence="12">12 Mauro Ceruti the improbability of the survival of the human species over greater or smaller timespans, our very construction and communication of these scenarios would immediately alter this improbability, and would continue to alter it constantly. With counterfutures the rules and parameters are not translatable into those which apply to counterpasts. The future of the human species has not yet been decided. But our very present, on the other hand, (and with it the various pasts placed along the temporal branch which leads to it) defines a context (or co-text, as Umberto Eco would say) with multiple universes, whose structure decisively reveals the fallacies of ultra-adaptational concepts and the inexorable retrograde motion of the real contained therein. The present, in other words, is often split into relatively independent subsets (which can be defined universes), each of which constitutes a kind of counterpresent in the other universes. Each one leads to the emergence of different possibili- ties, and often what contingency has removed from one it has strength- ened in another. During the course of natural history some isolated continents have assumed the role of parallel universe several times (counterpast and counterpresent). In particular, South America (until three million years ago, when it collided with North America) and Australia (up to the present) have shown how the history of mammals cannot be reduced to a linear scale of progress which would lead from the monotremes (duck-billed platypus, et al.) and from the marsupials towards the full-fledged mammals. Monotremes and marsupials are not foreshadowings of future mammals, but rather autonomous and equally-developed forms which branched off and diversified in those natural laboratories shaped by the contingency of continental drift. From another perspective, the universe of bacteria is a counterpresent to the universe of multicellular organisms: it enables us decisively to broaden our concept of life, since it reveals environmental niches, behavioral patterns, metabolic, and biochemical traits which were eliminated, excluded, or never developed in our so-called more devel- oped multicellular universe. What was thought to be a more rudi- mentary state is revealed as a parallel "other" state, both interesting and puzzling (and in this case the "other" is indispensable for our own survival). What pertains to the long timescales of biological evolution pertains also to the shorter timescales of the evolution of our civiliza- tions. The great migrations which enabled our species to populate the entire planet have given rise, until quite recently, to relatively</page><page sequence="13">NARRATIVE ELEMENTS 1 3 impassable geographical barriers, so that the New World (the Amer- icas) has been relatively isolated from the Old World, and Australia from both. In many respects the traditions which developed con- structed parallel presents, which have dramatically collided since the fateful year of 1492. Is it not then perhaps true that the most glaring error of modern anthropology has been that of interpreting the "other" parallel as if it were a "before," easily placeable within a linear outline of prehistory and history? And is it not perhaps true that the anthropological problem which is of the greatest importance for the current end of the modern era is the creation of a new history, in the light of the discovery that what we assumed was a "before" turns out to be an "other," heralding many changes in our ways of viewing the world? What's at stake is a heightened awareness of changes, innovations, and the potentials inherent in other ways of obtaining food, inhabiting ecosystems, regulating social life, creating and transmitting traditions, viewing the world, living spiritual dimen- sions Perhaps what is most emblematic of this transition, which has been elaborated in a highly creative manner in the research con- ducted by Isabelle Stengers and Tobie Nathan (1995), is the emer- gence of a new sensibility towards the concepts of health and sick- ness, as well as the healing methods practiced by many civilizations located beyond the horizons of that world which until recently we judged to be the only one possessing the attributes of present and future. With very vigorous force the so-called "before" has revealed a network of "other" ways which refute, consolidate, or broaden the range of our traditional questions. More and more, healing through explicative methods, which Western medicine has made its own, shows itself to be stunted and incomplete if it pays no attention to the healing practices which use narration and the power of sugges- tion as fundamental components. Today, research in natural history and research in the history of civilization resonate together, showing the inadequacy of an ap- proach which narrates by combining events, boundaries, and break- throughs into a continuous linear progression, maintaining that everything that happened was inevitable, and everything was defined at the beginning. However, the beginning, the development, and the combining of events have nothing inevitable about them. But every one has irreversibly occurred, and the present state of life, of species and of civilizations, has been generated through their combining and their interaction.</page><page sequence="14">14 Mauro Ceruti This is the cultural context which gives the deepest meaning to one of the most important facts of our time: that physics itself, born out of the Copernican revolution, is undergoing a Darwinian revolu- tion. After fortifying itself behind the walls of atemporality during its classic period, at the end of the twentieth century physics discovers the need to face change, evolution, and history inside its own bound- aries. Today nothing can escape Darwin's outlook, at most confined to the living world, and constantly questioned by a physics which is "unable to give meaning to the very idea of history": neither life, "nor matter, or the space-time continuum" (Prigogine &amp; Stengers, 1988: 44). The impossibility of reducing the apparent change of events into underlying atemporal regularities has forced even physics to open its fortifications to the deep significance of the Darwinian revolution, and to the type of rational consciousness which it had to elaborate in order to recognize and understand evolution. As Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers have lucidly written: Darwinian evolution is evidently nothing more than a model, and not the reality of each history. But each history contains, as does the Darwinian model, irreversibility, the event and the possibility for certain events, in certain circumstances, to acquire a signifi- cance and to be the starting point of new coherences. Under- standing a history is neither reducing it to underlying regularities, nor to a chaos of arbitrary events, but rather simultaneously grasp- ing coherences and events: coherences because they can resist events, make them insignificant, or inversely be destroyed or transformed by some of them; and events insofar as they can, to a greater or lesser extent, cause the emergence of new historical possibilities (1988: 18). In this perspective, the set of evolutionary possibilities within natural history is not given a priori, not permanently fixed. The pos- sible universe regenerates itself over and over, in a discontinuous and unpredictable manner. Natural history is also a natural history of possibilities, in which new possible universes are produced by changes, discontinuities, and developments in the evolutionary proc- esses. During the course of this natural history certain possibilities become fixed, and bond together, thereby eliminating some possible alternatives, but also producing new ones. The natural history of these bonds, and the natural history of possibilities, are tightly linked; they coevolve together.</page><page sequence="15">NARRATIVE ELEMENTS 1 5 REFERENCES Chertok, L. &amp; Stengers, Isabelle (1990).
