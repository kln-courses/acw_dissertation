<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY HOWARD BECKER 1. The Imperative of Science? Science is one faith and has one great command- ment. The faith is simply that man can control his future in his own interest. In the face of the appalling discrepancy between the powers of the natural and the social sciences, a discrepancy that leads to visions of man's liquidation by man, the assertion is nevertheless made that the remedy for the consequences of science is more science. The long record of scientific victories in the past gives some warrant, let us suppose, for faith in continued victory, but at bottom there is no compelling proof. There never has been, and, I make bold to say, there never will be. The role of scientist in the human drama always contains lines reminiscent of Prometheus; an utterly nonrational belief in ultimate triumph lends him strength to confront what to others may seem a hopeless future. (This entire paper is so condensed as to be almost elliptical at many points. Fortunately, the writer has dealt with several of the topics touched upon in his recent book, Through Values to Social Interpretation. (3) The frequency with which it will appear in the references is not because the writer regards it as of major importance, but because it dovetails more neatly with this paper than do many other more significant books. Moreover, it has fairly full footnote and chapter bibliographies. The statements in the non-parenthetical part of this paragraph are good examples of the near-elliptical character of much of what is said here. Expansion is badly needed, but the reader must be referred to (2) ch. vi of (3). The position represented is not new; many writers, among them William James, have held it in various ways.) All the sciences in one way or another enjoin this faith on their adherents; and if we may assume that the injunction is taken to heart in equal measure by everyone, from the standpoint of the scientific faith alone there are no distinc- tions of rank. The good scientist merely is the man who in his calling strives to be a scientist as far as in him lies; the degree of success achieved in his actual scientific work is no measure of his devotion to the scientific faith. It follows from this that there are no better or worse sciences; inasmuch as all are assumed to be struggling toward the same goal to the limit of their powers, the more advanced are not superior to those that lag behind. Though many of us will grant these assumptions in the abstract-especially if, like the writer, they are adherents of a science notorious for its present lack of precision-there can be no doubt that there is concretely a definite rank order among scientists. Whether the theoretical physicists are the five-star generals I dare not presume to say, but I know, I think, that the social scientists are often the buck privates. Indeed, there are those commissioned officers who refer casually, although doubtless without malicious intent, to "the social studies" as beyond the charmed circle of the sciences as such. Having volunteered for the duration, social scientists can only do their duty to the best of their ability, 273</page><page sequence="2">274 HOWARD BECKER wryly amusing themselves the while with George Orwell's remark in Animal Farm, "All men are equal, but some are more equal than others." Levity aside, and speaking less figuratively, it may be said that the duty en- joined by the scientific faith can be put in the form of the one great scientific commandment: "No value-judgments in science that derive from sources other than the supreme value-judgment-that control is ultimately desirable are ethically permissible by the scientist in his specifically scientific capacity." (3, p. 297.) That is to say, in his strictly scientific role, although in that role only, the scientist has laid upon him the commandment of ethical neutrality as over against all ends other than the supreme end of control. ("Control" is here used in a special sense; its meaning is correlative with "prediction," likewise used in a special sense-3, pp. 284-293). The man who in his would-be scientific role is unable or unwilling to act on the faith that the remedy for the consequences of science is more science, and to that end will not reject all preferences conflicting with the achievement of control as such, is from other standpoints just as good a man as anyone else, but he is not a scientist-and this is a simple declarative state- ment; no praise or blame is implied. Note has perhaps been taken of the fact that I repeatedly refer to the scien- tific role as such, thereby implying that the total personality includes more than one role. This is so obvious as hardly to be worth explicit statement. What is not so obvious is the uniwarranted implication occasionally drawn by scientists and nonscientists alike; namely, that although the total personality of the sci- entist takes in more than the scientific role, the one great commandment of science demands that the scientific role should dominate all others at all times. Otherwise put, it is believed that the scientist should be only a scientist. (Else- where I have called this "value-monotheism"-3, pp. 299-303.) This, regardless of "should," is empirically nonsensical; Peer Gynt encoun- tered personalities completely absorbed in a single role only in the madhouse. It is demonstrable, I trust, that the incidence of paranoia among scientists is not greater, and let us hope less, than among a random sample of the popula- tion-although certain newspaper cartoons might lead the unwary to think other- wise. We are ordinarily sons, husbands, fathers, citizens, and a thousand-and- one other things as well as scientists. Moreover, the "should" is warranted from the standpoint of the scientific faith itself only if it can be shown that all other roles are in necessary conflict with the scientific. If there ever were such a thing as a completely totalitarian society, with a system of final ends diametrically opposed to those of science, then the conflict would be joined all along the line, but even such past and present totalitarianisms as Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Phalangist-Franco Spain, and Communist Russia are not complete. Genuine science still survives, albeit in sheltered crannies, and gains support from many realms of life where the roles played are compatible with scientific freedom. Periodic purges such as those that eliminated the more prominent opponents of Lysenko do not reach all the disaffected, or at the most merely force them to double-talk of the kind made famous by Galileo. My own experience in the de-Nazification of German scien-</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY 275 tists led me to the conviction that not even the highly efficielnt Security Service, the Gestapo, and the ever-present danger of the concentration camp could secure more than surface conformity among the majority. A minority did prove recreant as scientists to the one great scientific commandment, but their proportion in the universities was at highest one in five. (From February, 1947, to September, 1948, I was an occupation official in charge of the Hessian universities of Marburg and Frankfurt, the Giessen college of agriculture, and the Darmstadt institute of technology. There had been some preliminary screening before February, 1947, but the actual procedures under the law for "liberation from National Socialism and militarism" devolved upon me. I had charge of Hessia only; there were similar higher education officials in all the German provinces in all the zones.) Moreover, I am not inclined to sit in general judgment on all those who have proved faithless to science. It is quite proper, I think, to say that having once betrayed their scientific trust they should not be reinstated in their scientific positions, but that is a specific judgment. If for the sake of saving the lives of friends, relatives, or even themselves they bowed the knee in Rimmon's house, I cannot find it in me to denounce them as utterly unworthy human beings. Who am I to say that under all conceivable circumstances the scientific com- mandment should take precedence over all others? The man who renounces his allegiance to science for the sake of what he regards, self-deceivingly or with full awareness, as a higher allegiance, is simply an unreliable scientist-and that is all. From other standpoints I may pity or condemn his weakness, cowardice, or evasive rationalizing, but in my role as scientist I can rightfully judge him only as someone who must be denied the name and opportunities of a scientist. But I digress; the essential point is that we have no right, as scientists, to assert that anyone should be only a scientist. We can merely say, "In your scientific role you must subscribe to the scientific faith and observe the one great scientific commandment. As long as your other roles do not involve you in irreconcilable conflict with the scientific, play them out to the full. If they do so conffict, and you cannot bring yourself to renounce them, we exclude you from the ranks of science. Good-bye and good luck." 2. Scientific Monism and Pluralism. The faith that the remedy for the conse- quences of science is more science is one faith, and its inseparable commandment that all value-judgments except the supreme scientific value-judgment must be renounced in the scientific role is one commandment. Science of any and every sort is in this sense one science. Having said this, I have not said that science is now one in method. That it may become so in some remote future I certainly do not wish dogmatically to deny, nor do I wish to cast aspersions on the efforts of the earnest workers in the Unity of Science movement. Developments in mathematics, symbolic logic, and semantics may eventually make it possible to construct a set of ultimate postulates with which all other pragmatically effective postulational systems can be related with full rigor and algoristic productivity. Those devoted to the pur- suit of such ultimate postulates are performing what is perhaps the most useful,</page><page sequence="4">276 HOWARD BECKER and certainly one of the most difficult, of all scientific functions. Looking at their activities as a rank outsider, I seem to see the beginnings of a comprehensive unification as between the fields of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and even of biology-but that may be because the outsider is rarely or ever aware of the minor inconsistencies that may eventually grow into major cleavages and thereby postpone the unification. Assuming, however, that such unification is effectively under way in the fields mentioned, and probably in others I have not named, I am nevertheless com- pelled to say that in the social sciences as I know them, no actual unification is yet definitely in process. Apart from fairly general agreement that quantifica- tion should be practiced whenever legitimately possible, and that the logic of experiment, interpreted as essentially probability logic, should prevail, there is little methodological consensus. What little there is, moreover, cannot readily be demonstrated as prevailing in actual research. The social scientists, for the most part, are still restlessly travelling along paths that se6m to lead in radically different directions. This is perhaps as it should be, unless we wilfully ignore the historically demonstrable fact that effective science emerges as effective working methods emerge. Hard, persistent work with the relevant evidence brought the more exact sciences where they are today; their absolutely necessary theoretical ap- paratus took account, at every step, of the phenomena which that apparatus simultaneously revealed and made relevant and which in so doing was progres- sively modified. As I read some recent treatises on The Scientific Method as applicable to the social sciences, however, I am reminded of the nursery ditty of long ago: Where do you come from, Baby dear? Out of the Everywhere into the Here. Instead of explaining where little methodologies come from in mundane terms, namely, as the product of appropriately sensitized and inquiring minds that have mated with attractive evidence, we have the myth of The Scientific Method. This myth has been elaborated, in most cases, by those social scientists who have had little first-hand experience in actual research. They devoutly believe that there is a sort of universally applicable pattern pervading scientific effort every- where and always. In previous generations biology, chemistry and like sciences have provided the base lines of the pattern; at present, although occasionally more concrete specialities such as mechanics or physiology prove appealing, the chief model is relativity physics. (8) May we say, therefore, that the question as to where little methodologies come from is often answered in terms of the physicist's rather than the physician's black bag? There has been a tendency, in other words, to look to physics as the model of science on which the social sciences should pattern themselves. Distilling from various physical inquiries and general treatises the rules in accordance with which they think these inquiries have been conducted, the advocates of the myth proclaim these rules to be binding on the social sciences. They lay great stress</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY 277 on the criterion of the internal consistency of the postulational system that, beyond question, can thereby be achieved, seeming to think that a scientifically satisfactory kind of explanation consists in the reduction of a situation to ele- ments with which we are so familiar that we accept them as a matter of course and thereby quiet our curiosity. But is a genuinely scientific explanation merely a matter of internal consistency? Is it not, on the contrary, a matter of predictive validation within a systematized frame of reference that at key points has also been predictively verified? Let me offer at this point my own definition: Scientific activity is the systematic statement of the probability of the hypo- thetical or actual recurrence of phenomena that for the purposes in hand are regarded as identical. (3, p. 97.) From this it follows that genuine explanation takes place when the recurrence of a phenomenon has been successfully predicted and systematically related to a general predictive system. Internal consistency is not enough; it may satisfy those given to speculative symmetry, but the working scientist cannot rely on it alone. Leaving those enamored of internal consistency to their speculations, let us look at what working scientists are actually doing. We see, do we not, that every research dealing with empirical evidence eventually develops its own rules of method? These, with their accompanying array of concepts, arise because the working scientist has run up against some specific obstacle in the handling of some specific body of evidence (and this is not to say that "facts" dictate "theory" -more about this later). If the method and its frame of reference help the sci- entist to get around the obstacle, and that is to say, to predict successfully, well and good; if not, it is useless no matter how closely it corresponds to some uni- versal and internally consistent formula. What all working scientists think in common amounts to little more than ten or twenty catch phrases that could be rattled off by bright high-school youngsters who have had a course in "general science. " These platitudinous phrases, consisting of items such as "sense-experience,'" "hypothesis," "objectivity," and so on, are supposed to sum up The Scientific Method. They may express in concise form what many working scientists say they agree upon, but nevertheless a physicist is merely a befuddled spectator in a chemistry laboratory if he is only a physicist. If difficulties crop up as between working chemist and physicist, what are we to say about the pyramiding of postulates that balances the social sciences precariously at the pinnacle? The platitudes to which reference has been made are so empty that they can be filled with almost any content, or even discarded altogether when the situa- tion demands. The plain fact, it seems to me, is that the working scientist is not much concerned with the universal methodological pattern that his proce- dures supposedly exhibit. He is more likely to be interested in the rules that he has devised for the avoidance of obstacles encountered when the evidence peculiar to his science is squarely confronted. Casting aside the admonition, "Be bold, be bold-but not too bold," I venture</page><page sequence="6">278 HOWARD BECKER to assert that the use in the social sciences of The Scientific Method will yield fruitful results only if the rubber-stamp phrases of that method retain their rubber-stamp character. If they are given content that is not of social-cultural origin, and are then used in social science contexts, they will prove positively harmful. As long as they remain platitudinous, however, they can at least do no real harm, and may even help to give that heightened confidence, and conse- quent increase in working capacity that often goes with belief in one's own or- thodoxy. To recast the argument: only an incorrigible optimist could expect to find a shortcut through the dense thicket confronting the social-scientific explorer by consulting a compass that points only toward physics and similar sciences. Inspection of the outstanding works in the social sciences reveals that the paths follow the lay of the land. The explorer goes from one point of vantage to another and eventually arrives at his goal. Does he proclaim that he has found the only correct procedure for all exploration whatsoever? If the path lacks that direct- ness or, dropping the figure, that symmetry and finish which some logicians think necessary, it is because of the evidence with which he deals and because of the contemporary state of verified social-scientific knowledge guiding his operations. His working methods are inherently united with the specific problems posed by predictive inquiry into his specific varieties of evidence. Once he has achieved some degree of predictive mastery, however slight, new problems arise, and they are solved, if at all, in the same way as before-namely, by transition from one specific aspect to another, plus further successful prediction. (The substance of parts of this section has been presented in (2) in more detail. It now seems necessary to reiterate and justify my earlier rejection of the as- sumption that "facts" dictate "theory." My animadversions on The Scientific Method relate only to the attempt directly to apply to one kind of evidence the concepts and methods that have been developed in conjunction with another kind. Direct transference of working concepts and methods is difficult, to put it mildly, because the concepts and methods develop in conjunction with the evi- dence, and because at the same time the evidence becomes relevant-indeed becomes evidence!-only in and through the concepts and methods. I did not remotely imply that there is an impassable barrier between relevant "fact" and relevant "theory"; "fact" and "theory" develop pari passu, in dialectic interplay. As Jensen has aptly said: It is an unfortunate accident of history that the term datum (Latin, past par- ticiple of dare, "to give") rather than captum (Latin, past participle of capere, "to take") should have come to symbolize the unit-phenomenon in science. For science deals, not with "that which has been given" by nature to the scientist, but with "that which has been taken" or selected from nature by the scientist in accordance with his purpose, arid to a degree even constructed out of nature by the scientist's preliminary assumptions as to which of "the things which have been given" are also to be "taken" or observed. (3, ed. note, p. ix.) Indeed, even Jensen's statement may be regarded as not quite hitting off the essential point: all data are in some sense capta, for nothing is given unless it is simultaneously taken. Without necessarily making a commitment to realism,</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY 279 critical or otherwise, I am prepared to take the position that although I feel con- strained to accept the existence of a world of objects independent of any observer, those objects can be known only as capta. If we take account, however, of the fact that Jensen is referring to the scientist rather than to the ordinary observer, we may use the term data to refer to all those "facts" that are "given" to normal specimens of Homo sapiens who have become human through development in a culture (more of this later). Capta can then be reserved to refer both to scientifi- cally relevant data perceivable without any theoretical equipment other than a general scientific orientation, and to additional data that are perceived and se- lected only in conjunction with scientific theories of particular kinds. It is my contention that it is capta of this latter type, those perceived in and through theories of particular kinds rather than by means of 7The Scientific Method, that are essential to the advance of science. It is these "facts" that develop and are developed by predictively valid "theories"; one cannot functionally exist without the other. This, then, is what I meant by saying that little methodologies are "the prod- uct of appropriately sensitized and inquiring minds that have mated with attrac- tive evidence." Now that we have confronted the facts of life, let us forget the physicists's black bag. We must, however, also confront the fact that methodologies can increase in- definitely in number; there seems to be no logical stopping-point. This arises from the apparently inescapable conclusion that methodologies bring forth capta and capta bring forth methodologies, world without end, Amen. Not only is science in general without ascertainable limits, but there is seemingly no way to restrict the birth rate of new sciences-or, if you like, sub-sub-sub sciences. Not even recourse to the Nietzschean doctrine of eternal recurrence could avail us; for if we were to grant that everything has happened an infinite number of times in the eternal past and will recur an infinite number of times in the eternal future, then we should also have to grant that "everythings" themselves are likewise infinite and we would just keep on going. We already know that we are likely to keep on going anyway unless we liquidate ourselves and everybody else, and the scientific faith prevents most of us from envisaging that as in any way probable. Let our maxims then be, "Be fruitful and multiply," and "In this sign conquer." (This paper was read at the 1950 national meeting of the Phil- osophy of Science Association, Roosevelt College, Chicago. In 1952, Florian Znaniecki, the man from whom, over the years, I have learned most about social- scientific method, published his latest important book (17). I am gratified to note that the position summarized in the foregoing section is virtually identical, in many important respects, with his. This has come about because I learned much from him, not because he learned anything in particular from me!) 3. The Capturing of Culture. Turning now to some of the concepts and capta of the social sciences, let us begin with a definition of culture. There are many, but one of the simplest and best is that offered by Myres: ". . . 'culture' is not a state or condition only, but a process; as in agriculture or horticulture we mean not the condition of the land but the whole round of the</page><page sequence="8">280 HOWARD BECKER farmer's year, and all that he does in it; 'culture,' then, is what remains of men's past, working on their present, to shape their future." (12, p. 16) There has been some investigation and discussion as to whether the nonhuman animals have culture, and the conclusion is that if they do it is so little in amount and importance that it can ordinarily be disregarded. For all practical purposes the social scientist deals with man as the only animal whose conduct is insepar- ably bound up with culture. Until recently it was held useful to view culture primarily as tangible and in- tangible, or material and nonmaterial, but in view of the fact that physics as an aspect of culture, for example, is effectively composed of both instrument-using activities and theorizing activities, the distinction is losing currency except as an auxiliary. More useful is Woodard's (A) expressive, (B) regulative, and (C) technical classification. (A) The expressive aspect of culture includes games of numerous kinds, music, the dance, the graphic and plastic arts, literature, the drama, certain phases of religious and other ceremonial, and all other activities engaged in primarily though not always exclusively as ends in themselves, as their own best reasons for being. (B) The regulation-seeking aspect includes customary and positive law in both unsystematized and systematized forms, governmental regimes of every kind, economic injunctions and prohibitions, many magical and religious prescriptions, and all similar activities. The regulation-seeking components of culture are ordinarily treated as means to ends, but can readily become ends in themselves. (Woodard refers to "control," but in order to avoid confusion with "control" as discussed in the section on "The Imperative of Sci- ence?," I have taken the liberty of substituting "regulation.") (C) The technical aspect takes in scientific as well as technological activities and also magical practices believed by their adherents to give mastery over the surrounding world. (15 and 16) The technical elements in culture are usually handled as means to ends; they are rarely dealt with as ends in themselves. Only in the scientific role, for example, is science viewed as in any sense an end in itself, and seldom if ever does the scientific role dominate the entire personality. It should, of course, be clear that Woodard's classification is purely analytic; it is virtually impossible to find a culture trait that is expressive and that only, or regulative and that only, or technical and that only. Moreover, the dis- tinction between means and ends is dependent on the situations with regard to which the distinction is made; what in one situation is a means may in another become an end. Finally, it is quite evident that every aspect of culture may in- clude both material and nonmaterial components, for, harking back to Myres, culture is "what remains of men's past, working on their present, to shape their future." If material objects work on the present and thereby shape the future, they do so because ways of using or interpreting them have been transmitted from the past, and these ways are nonmaterial. Conversely, who could today transmit effectively skills of medicine without the material traits represented by handbooks and treatises, drugs, surgical instruments, and the like? Also to be borne in mind is that fact that there is no sharp line between "na-</page><page sequence="9">SCIENCE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY 281 ture" and culture. It will be remembered that we have interpreted data as "all those 'facts' that are 'given' to normal specimens of Homo sapiens who have be- come human through development in a culture" (italics added here). Obviously, capta covering both general and specific scientific "facts" are available, in any functional sense, only within a culture where scientific activity has gained a foothold. The "nature" apprehended by the human being, then, is defined by culture as data and their related capta. Doubtless there is a nature that cease- lessly affects us and of which we as mere biological entities are parts, but as we come to know (in the sense of communicable knowledge) "nature," we know it only in and through culture. If culture is held to be "artificial," then the "na- ture" with which we deal as human beings is also "artificial." Moreover, we can shift the focus slightly and view culture as an outgrowth of nature in both its known and unknown aspects. Quoting Shakespeare: Nature is made better by no mean But Nature makes that mean; Over that Art which you say adds to Nature Is an Art that Nature makes. With the concept and some of the capta of culture now before us, reference can be made to an earlier passage of the present paper that ran as follows: "In- spection of the outstanding works in the social sciences reveals that the paths follow the lay of the land. The explorer goes from one point of vantage to another, and eventually arrives at his goal ... His working methods are inherently united with the specific problems posed by predictive inquiry into his specific varieties of evidence." In other words, the social scientist deals with culture, with what man has made with hand and tongue, including the sociative (associa- tive or dissociative or both) processes and structures in which culture is de- veloped, imparted, and transmitted. Culture cannot be theoretically reduced to the levels of biology, chemistry, or physics without practically complete loss of predictive power. We learn what Japanese or Russians or Americans are likely to do next by the scientific study of their cultures, not by treating them as aggregates of organisms, cells, molecules, or atoms. (3, pp. 189-205.) Culture in all its aspects--expressive, regulative, and technical-must be analyzed as culture, not as "nothing but" something else. We can reduce capta to other capta if we wish, of course, but what we get is speculative gratification, not scientific prediction. Reductionism, which not infrequently is regarded as part of The Scientific Method, is as old as Democritus and as new as dianetics; old or new, it is of little use to the social scientist. 4. Symbolism and the Units of Social Science. Society, a shorthand term for the sociative processes and structures in which culture is developed, imparted, and transmitted, is itself an aspect of culture, for by society is here meant human society. Persistent clusterings among the nonhuman animals there unquestion- ably are, and these clusterings often show quite stable patterns, hierarchical and otherwise, such as the well -known "pecking order." Further, there are frequently prolonged sexual-reproductive clusterings that are as enduring as many human</page><page sequence="10">282 HOWARD BECKER arrangements. We may call these "societies," "families," and so forth if we wish, but the risk of anthropomorphic homology is always present. It seems best, therefore, to prefix adjectives such as "nonhuman" when using out of context terms that have developed with primary reference to human affairs. Sociation cannot be successfully interpreted and predicted without precise specification of the cultural context in and through which it occurs, and once this is clearly understood, it is unnecessary perpetually to specify "human." Culture, at the very least in a difference of degree so great that it becomes virtually a difference of kind, is a human attribute. (3, pp. 7-8). Some of the evidence that leads to such a conclusion has long been known; witness the famous anecdote in which Herodotus contrasts the funeral practices of Hindus with those of Greeks and concludes, with Pindar, that "custom is king of all." (6, III, 38.) Ethnography and history abound with thoroughly attested exhibits of the astounding multiplicity of man's ways of life. Homo sapiens is one species, but from this we cannot infer howr he will be governed, how many mates he will have, what he will eat, or what religious beliefs will sway him. The nonhuman animals, on the other hand, are in comparison re- freshingly uniformn where the behavior of any given species is concerned. Every- thing we know points to differences in culture as the large-scale source of human variability. Culture of course does not descend on the wings of a dove; obviously only animals of a certain kind can develop culture. Bypassing here what might be an interesting survey of the work of Mead, Cassirer, Langer, Piaget, Goldstein, and many others, (11, 4, 7, 13, 5, and 14), let it be said that upright posture, binocular vision, highly adaptable grasping equipment, prolonged infancy, lack of rigid instincts, and like traits are not enough; man can develop, learn, and transmit culture primarily because he is Homo loquens, Man the Talker. He is not limited to signals such as the bark, the grunt, the cluck, or the bellow; he is able to use significant symbols. Man alone has developed elaborate systems of sounds, transmitted from generation to generation by means of the learning process, which vary radically from culture to culture and serve as means of genu- ine communication within cultures. Manifestly, there are in man's cultural heri- tage other types of significant symbolization, and some of these, such as the pri- marily visual symbols of mathematics, are increasing in importance, but in the human record language looms largest and will probably maintain its preeminence in any future that we can at present foresee. Language as genuine communication naturally presupposes the intimate association of generations in a complex learning process. This process is not merely imitative, as Mead has shown; it necessitates the peculiar kind ot interac- tion known as the assuming of roles, of responding to one's own actions as others respond to them. (3, pp. 6-14.) What is called the socializing of the child involves not merely the repetition of sounds uttered by adults but also the acquiring of sound-making skills in social situations. A word is not an isolated unit where the child is concerned; it is just one part of a complex configuration in which vaguely felt tensions, dimly perceived tokens of approval and disapproval, and a host of</page><page sequence="11">SCIENCE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY 283 other items impossible to detail here are, as it were, "all wrapped up together." The transmission of language as the key activity of culture, then, is dependent on society-but the form of society is in turn dependent on antecedent culture, and that in turn oii prior transmission, and so on. As I have put it elsewhere: In the above sense, neither society nor culture has priority in time; they emerge concomitantly. The same is true of personality and culture and of personality and society ... [although for] any given personality society and culture in the gen- eral sense are of course prior in time. (3, pp. 189-247.) In the socializing process, necessarily occurring in culture, sociation in the strict sense makes its appearance when definite selves and definite others emerge -in fact, sociation is synonymous with self- and other-defined action. The point of importance here is that self and other, to speak elliptically, are not trans- mitted in the germ plasm; the child who through isolation is cut off from the socializing process does not become human, for he does not develop a self. This may be put even more drastically: man is not born human, and he becomes human only through socialization in a culture, thereby acquiring capacity for action in terms of self and other. Then and then only is he a member of a society; then and then only is he a personality, with power to play a repertory of social roles. (3, pp. 15-21.) This is an all-too-brief presentation of what has come to be known as sym- bolic interactionism; in one form or another it is the social-psychological basis of much contemporary work in the social sciences. Its importance from the standpoint of method is perhaps already apparent, but further comment may not be amiss. Clearly enough, the physico-chemical and biological types of con- figuration are the necessary conditions of social-cultural configurations, but are they sufficient conditions? Can we deduce from the knowledge they offer the characteristic manifestations of social-cultural phenomena? I am inclined to think that we cannot so much as deduce linguistic phenomena in general, to say nothing of differences between linguistic patterns, and much less, differences between self- and-other interactions. Once having become aware of speech as indispensable to culure and sociation, we may attribute it, if we wish, to differ- ences in electron-proton configurations, or what not, but such attribution yields no predictive power. There is no predictive value in merely reducing phenomena to their necessary conditions; we must know the sufficient conditions under which they appear and run their course. Among these conditions one that is quite indispensable, the language process, seems to be man's peculiar gift. Therefore, any social-scientific methodology worthy of the name will center attention on Homo loquens. Such attention will have to be close and sustained. Earlier in this paper I said that every research dealing with empirical materials develops its own rules of method, and that these arise because the working scientist is forced to "follow the lay of the land." Given the indubitable fact of sociative and cultural diversity, it seems to be that the specific obstacle most frequently encountered by the social scientist is the discrepancy between responses to "stimuli" as they are</page><page sequence="12">284 HOWARD BECKER defined in scientific frames of reference anid ordinary human responses to these "stimuli." The same uInits of "stimulus," in other words, may call forth widely differing varieties of conduct. Here is our obstacle; what means have been devised to get around it? Working social scientists make use of an array of concepts for the listing of which space is lacking here, but in general it may be said that they are designed to determine the contours of the worlds which varying human beings, with their "igift of tongues," have defined for themselves. Implicitly or explicitly, the social scientist is aware of the difference between the situation as defined by the imme- diate participant and the situation as defined by the scientific observer-of the difference between data and capta. The social scientist knows that he cannot pro- ceed as though the persons he happens to be studying are responding to a situa- tion as defined by him. When he has really come to grips with his evidence, he tries to find out "what men live by," which is to say, how they define the situa- tions with which they are in reciprocal relation. He must not first of all select and trim his units by what he as a scientific observer responds to, but by what the subjects selectively define and hence make effective as units in the structure of their actions. Thus viewed, "units" cannot be arbitrarily whittled out to fit a postulational system that has not been constructed to take account of the sufficient conditions of the phenomena under investigation. The units of physics, chemistry, and biology represent only some of the necessary conditions of social- cultural conduct (3, pp. 189-247, and 17). 5. Avoidance of Question-Begging. Now for some qualifications that are more than qualifications; they are theoretically indispensable to predictively useful work in the social sciences. Paradoxically enough, this predictive indispensability is negative-that is to say, these qualifications deal with what cannot safely be predicted, in the scientific sense, with the theoretical equipment now available to the social sciences. To begin with, it cannot be assumed that society determines culture, even though, as we know, they are reciprocally related. In spite of the fact that cul- ture is transmitted and learned only in sociative situations, it is also true that socialization is discontinuous, variable, and partial. Man is not born human, and he does not become fully human in the sense of completely conforming to his society. This being the case, he does not entirely conform to his culture (prop- erly speaking, the remainder of his culture) either. At any given time, there is ordinarily enough conformity by a sufficient number of members to secure the satisfactory playing of all the standard roles, and the society functions well enough for it to stay on the stage, so to speak. Occasionally, however, one or more key roles will be inadequately played, with the consequence that the rest of the cast of characters does not respond to cues and the drama slows up or comes to an almost complete stop. Less frequently, novel variations in key roles are in- troduced, and the social drama is thereby reconstructed in ways now unpredict- able. Moreover, certain sections of the culture may develop more rapidly than the self- and-other-oriented parts. Instance the fact that mathematical formulas</page><page sequence="13">SCIENCE, CULTURE, AND SOCIETY 285 have been worked out that for decades and even centuries found no application whatever. Indeed, there are some branches of pure mathematics now so detached from foreseeable application that only the history of mathematics, which shows that the pure has oftentimes become the applied in startlingly unan- ticipated ways, gives ground for the belief that the branches referred to will some day "justify their existence." In other words, systems of significant sym- bols may become functionally autonomous. Initially bound up with sociation, they finally reach a degree of self-containedness that, for example, makes Marx- ian talk of "bourgeois biology" or "proletarian music" a little strained. Put still otherwise, the social scientist must grant the possibility that there may be immanent development within symbolic systems; he dare not assume that socia- tion and other aspects of culture correspond point for point. The opposite assumption, that culture determines society, is equally unwar- ranted. Other-worldly religious systems have sometimes exercised tremendous influence, but they have often fallen foul of kinship claims, political machina- tions, and the search for worldly goods. The absorption of meanings that are not directly self- and-other-oriented usually occurs only among small elites, and these elites rarely if ever transmit such meanings to the other members of the society without being forced to dilute them considerably. More often than we like to think, almost insuperable hindrances to their effective transmission crop up. Archimedes was engrossed in geometry even when the fall of Syracuse was actually occurring, but his cry, "Do not disturb my circles!" brought only a finishing spear-thrust. And what is science today for large parts of the population of the Western world? Just another kind of magic that miraculously provides creature comforts. This is not to say that efforts to discover the reciprocal relations of culture and society should be abandoned-far from it! In resolute search for the pre- dictable regularities in this interplay, an array of specialties marginal to the humanities and the natural sciences on the one hand, and to the social sciences on the other, is now in process of rapid development, and this is as it should be. The study of the social relations of science, literature, music, art, mathematics, and other cultural end-products are of the utmost importance, and the co- operation of all concerned is to be enthusiastically welcomed. (1, 9, and 10.) 6. What It All Comes To. The lessons I have drawn from these considerations, for myself at least, run about as follows: First, unilateral determinisms of all kinds must be rejected. This applies to social and cultural determinism of man's conduct as well as to other varieties. Second, although the conception that the social and cultural is "merely" the outgrowth of the biological, and this in turn "merely" the outgrowth of the chem- ical and physical is to be set aside, this should not lead to "holism" or dogmatic emergentism. The tenable position seems to be simply that scientific progress is best made if unity of method is not arbitrarily and prematurely imposed. Third, avoidance of the preconceived idea that the social is "causally linked" with the cultural at every point, or the cultural with the social, or either or both of these with other natural phenomena, should not prevent the use of "functional</page><page sequence="14">286 HOWARD BECKER interdependence" as a research principle. Any aspect of culture may be taken as an independent variable and the attempt made to treat any aspect of society as a dependent variable thereof, and vice versa. Further, any aspect of culture or society may be treated as a dependent variable in relation to biological or other phenomena. The accuracy and systematic relevance of the predictions that can be made on this basis are the only criteria of whether or not it is warranted. Fourth, the development of specialties marginal both to society and the other aspects of culture is to be warmly greeted and furthered, for these specialties provide a testing ground for the utility of the principle of functional interde- pendence. Fifth, the traditional alignments of the social sciences, if no others, should be disregarded when they hamper the pursuit of predictive accuracy. Culture and society concern all the social sciences, and most genuine research problems lead across traditional departmental divisions (although it is granted that researches that merely cut through academic barriers are not ipso facto better than those that do not). Sixth and finally, the unity of science in faith and commandment is not a unity of the scientist except in his strictly scientific function. He has other parts to play in life, and he has the right to play them all to the best of his inclination and ability. In particular, he should resist all attempts by his scientific fellows or the lay public to force him to be a scientist and only a scientist. Even though it is often possible to preserve essential allegiance to the scientific faith in a rigidly controlled society, it is still true that science flourishes best in freedom- freedom for science, for religion, for politics, for sense and nonsense.
