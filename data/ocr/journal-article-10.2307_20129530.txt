<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARISTOTLE ON GOD AS THOUGHT THINKING ITSELF THOMAS DE KONINCK I -/VrISTOTLE'S DESCRIPTION OF GOD'S ACTIVITY as VOTjOLC VOTjOCUC, a "thinking of thinking," in chapters 7 and 9 of Metaphysics 12 raises some of the most significant and challenging questions in philosophy. These and other related chapters surely deserve Whitehead's praise in his own chapter on God in Science and the Modern World, where he accords to Aristotle "the position of the greatest metaphysician," add ing, concerning Aristotle's God, "in his consideration of this meta physical question [Aristotle] was entirely dispassionate; and he is the last European metaphysician of first-rate importance for whom this claim can be made. . . . It may be doubted whether any properly gen eral metaphysics can ever, without the illicit introduction of other con siderations, get much farther than Aristotle."1 It ought to surprise no one, then, if difficulties surrounding this crowning achievement should abound and even reduce some to make little sense of it. How, indeed, is one to understand the so-called thought of thought or thinking of thinking of the Prime Mover? Noth ing is easier than the reductio ad absurdum clearly anticipated in that striking passage in the Aristotelian corpus?possibly Aristotle's own?which speaks of God in contemplation of himself as an absurd ity. The author is wondering "whether the self-sufficient man will or will not need friendship" and dismisses the analogy of the Divine life as unhelpful and misleading. "For the argument about the Divine Being that we meet with is this. 'Since God possesses all good things and is self-sufficient, in what will His action consist? For His exis tence will not be one long sleep. Nay, He will contemplate something; for this is the noblest kind of activity and the most suited to Him. What then will He contemplate? If He contemplates anything else, it 1 Alfred North Whitehead, Science and the Modem World (New York: Macmillan, 1967), 173. Review of Metaphysics 47 (March 1994): 471-515.

It follows that He will contemplate Himself. But this too is absurd. If a man makes himself the object of his own research, we stigmatize him as a dullard. God in contem plation of Himself is therefore an absurdity.' "2 Self-contemplation in the anthropomorphic sense here described is a plain absurdity to anyone. So, however, is the Aristotelian God as read, say, by Eduard Zeller, W. D. Ross or, more recently, Klaus Oehler.3 I mean the interpretation?to quote Richard Norman's apt phrases?that "lends an air of unnecessary absurdity to the whole account," suggesting "that the Prime Mover is a sort of heavenly Nar cissus."4 One obvious culprit is the either/or most clearly formulated by Ross: either God knows himself, or he knows other things. By asserting that God knows one Aristotle would therefore exclude the other. "For him," writes Ross, "that God should know Himself and that He should know other things, are alternatives, and in affirming 2 Magna Moralia 2.15.1212b38-1213a7, trans. G.

Oehler's interpre tation is best summed up by himself: "In Aristotle's view the divine mind is a form of self-reference which cannot be understood from without and there fore it is inscrutable. In this sense it is a blanket term and, in a certain way, it is a blank. Nevertheless, the expression 'thinking of thinking' has a mean ing which is fundamental for Aristotle's philosophy as a whole. This ex pression (No?sis no?seos) refers to a reflexive relation, indeed to a total ab stract equality, a complete reflexivity (X = X), and its meaning consists in its reciprocal relation"; Oehler, Self-knowledge, 505. Hans Joachim Kr?mer rightly stresses how remote from Greek thought is such a description, which "an die moderne Reflexionsbewegung erinnert und als solche etwas eminent Ungriechisches an sich hat"; Hans Joachim Kr?mer, Der Ursprung der Geist metaphysik (Amsterdam: B. R. Gr?ner, 1974), 159; see also Hans Joachim Kr?mer, "Grundfragen der aristotelischen Theologie," Theologie und Philo sophie 44 (1969): 363-382, 481-505; Hans Joachim Kr?mer, "Zur geschicht lichen Stellung der aristotelichen Metaphysik," Kant-Studien 58 (1967): 313 54; and Hans Joachim Kr?mer, Piatonismus und he?enistiche Philosophie (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1971), 131-87.</page><page sequence="3">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 473 the first alternative he implicitly denies the second."5 This either/or is pure invention, or misconception, as we shall see. Yet it has be come part of what Stephen Clark calls the "orthodox interpretation."6 A long list of distinguished commentators can be cited, of course, from Themistius to H. H. Joachim, Ingemar During, G?nther Patzig, and Jonathan Lear in our day, who understand Aristotle here along quite different lines. They include Avicenna, Maimonides, Aquinas, Trendelenburg, Franz Brentano and many others, not least Hegel whose lectures on Aristotle contain ten pages or so of close commen tary on these and other chapters of Metaphysics 12 most essential to the question of God?lectures punctuated by such exclamations of praise as "one can hardly believe one's eyes" (man traut kaum seinen Augen), in the very midst of chapter 7.7 The prevailing view among these commentators could be stated: "The principle of all things knows them all through knowing himself"; or, quoting Aquinas: intelligendo se, inteUigit omnia alia.8 5 W.

I use this also for the text, together with Aristotelis Metaphysica, ed. W. Jaeger, Oxford Classical Texts (London: Ox ford University Press, 1957). Oehler makes Aristotle's God sound like the odd student: "We have to learn that for Aristotle the perfection of the First Being does not consist in knowing everything but in the freedom from the necessity to be obliged to know everything"; Oehler, "Self-knowledge," 502; cf. pp. 501-3; and Oehler, Unbewegte Beweger, 83-6. 6 Stephen R.

The problem of the significance of vbr)oi&lt;; vofjoeuj? in Hegel's own thought?made evident by the culminating quote in Greek, without translation or comment, of twelve lines taken from the Metaphysics (1072M8-30) at the very end of Hegel's Encyclopaedia?is beyond the scope of this paper. Its treatment would have to take into careful account, among other things, his lectures on Plotinus, in which the theme of vorjoLc vofjoeujc plays an important role. Nor can the complex question of Hegel's general value and shortcomings as a reader of Aristotle, together with his obvious differences from him, be dealt with briefly, as it would have to be here.

These are the texts most often brought forward to defend Aristotle against this interpretation, espe cially since Brentano. There is no denying that their cumulative effect is impressive. It seems evident from them that in Aristotle's view for God to be ignorant of anything is a contradiction in terms; any form of ignorance is a manifest imperfection and God is perfect if anyone is perfect. Jacques Brunschwig is surely right: "pour Aristotle lui m?me la proposition 'Dieu ne conna?t pas toute chose' joue le r?le d'une cons?quence absurde en soi."9 ed. M.-R. Cathala and R. M.

See also R?mi Brague, "Le destin de la 'Pens?e de la Pens?e' des origines au d?but du Moyen Age," in QDAH, 153-86. Aquinas does not take kindly to the idea of imputing to Aristotle a God who would know nothing but himself: "In maiorem insaniam inde procedentes, aestimant Deum nihil nisi se ipsum intellectu cognoscere," De substantiis separatis, in Opuscula philosophica, ed. R. M. Spiazzi (Turin: Marietti, 1954), chap. 13, no. 116; cf. chap. 14, nos. 119-27. The most ardent modern defender of Aristotle in this regard is Franz Brentano. See his Die Psychologie des Aristoteles (1867; reprint, Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1967), 186-94; 234-50. Brentano is arguing against E. Zeller. See E.

Most of the relevant texts of Aristotle are to be found in an excellent summary by Jean P?pin, in his Id?es grecques sur l'homme et sur Dieu (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1971), 233-248. The most often quoted are Metaphysics 3.4.1000b2-5, and De Anima 1.5.410b4-7, where Aristotle criticizes Emped ocles for not realizing that the latter's views would force him to hold that God does not know everything. 10 It is false and misleading to claim, as does Oehler, that the traditional doctrine "according to which omniscience and immutability are necessarily properties of the most perfect being" is one of ulater ages" than Aristotle; Oehler, "Self-Knowledge," 502 (emphasis added); cf. Oehler, Unbewegte Be weger, 86. It is on the contrary a commonplace well before Aristotle. One among many illustrations, Xenophanes, ought to suffice. Xenophanes' cri tique of theological anthropomorphism and his importance for epistemology have been eloquently emphasized by Karl Popper; see Popper's Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1968), 25-6, 152, 225-6, 229. As Werner Jaeger points out in his The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1947), 38-54, Xenophanes's key theological concept is best expressed through the word eTrcnp?net, "it is fitting." It comes up in fragment 26 (see Hermann Diels and Walther Kranz, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker [here after, DK], 10th ed. [Berlin, Weidmannsche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1961], vol. 1, 21B26) to exclude motion from God?the "one God," ?c Oeo?, of fragment 23. As Jonathan Barnes puts it, "the phrase 'it is not fitting' is Xenophanes's archaic and poetical version of 'it is not logically possible'. It does not 'fit' the essential nature of god, or our concept of what it is to be divine, to imagine that divinities locomote: that is to say, 'God moves' is self-contradictory"; Jonathan Barnes, The Presocratic Philosophers (London: Routledge and Ke gan Paul, 1979), 1:85. See the whole of chap. 5, but esp. pp. 89-92 on Xe nophanes' monotheism; see also 137-143. Barnes brings out with equal fe licity the link in Xenophanes between omniscience and mastery, offering the following translation and comment for fragment 24: "He sees as a whole, he thinks as a whole, and he hears as a whole." "Divine omniscience is both traditional (e.g. Riad, II, 485; Odyssey, IV, 379, 468) and a plausible corollary of divine mastery. If god is omniscient, his organs of perception can hardly be localized: he needs eyes in the back of his head" (p. 93); see also p. 322. Jaap Mansfeld (in Die Vorsokratiker I [Stuttgart: Philip Reclam, 1983], 208 210) rightly describes Xenophanes' whole endeavor here as a first attempt at negative theology and a first inkling of the via eminentiae: "Bei Xenophanes finden wir also den ersten Versuch einer negativen Theologie, d. h. einer Umschreibung des G?ttlichen durch Verneinung des Menschlich-Vorstell baren. . . . Auch die sogenannte via eminentiae der rationalen Theologie ist bei Xenophanes schon vorgebilt." Cf. also notes 11 and 12 below.</page><page sequence="6">476 THOMAS DE KONINCK scores).11 To this may be added the fine wonder, universally ex pressed in ancient Greek literature and thought, before mind's evident ubiquity and its affinity with whole, or totality.12 Third, the view that the divine vov? knows only itself would make Aristotle contradict com mon conceptions. In view of Aristotle's characteristic respect for common conceptions and his appeal to them even in the Metaphysics this fact presents an even stronger objection?if a stronger objection is possible?against this interpretation.13 To summarize: apart from its intrinsic absurdity, such an inter pretation forces one into at least three rather gross contradictions. ?ric Weil's warning ought, instead, to be heeded: with Aristotle "on ne saurait... ?tre trop prudent: la contradiction n'est pas toiyours dans les textes, elle est assez souvent dans l'esprit de l'interpr?te."14 Jon athan Lear's questions are much closer to the mark: "What does God's thinking himself consist in? Is this a totally empty conception, a mere 11 See the whole splendid fragment 12 (DK 59B12). For Aristotle's ap preciation of Anaxagoras?whose treatment of vov? makes him appear, Ar istotle says, "like a sober man among babblers"?see Metaphysics 1.3.998bl5-18. On dominance and knowledge of all things, see De Anima 3.4.429al8-20; cf. Physics 8.5.256b24-27; Metaphysics 12.10.1075b8. 12 This is, of course, already obvious to anyone who has read the pre Socratics or Plato, where wisdom (oo&lt;f&gt;ia) and a true knowledge of everything are synonymous. See, for example, Heraclitus's famous fragment 50 (DK 22B50), saying that to the wise all things are one. For a broader range of references in ancient Greek literature see Brague, Aristote, 39-44, esp. p. 40. On this same aspect of mind, and on the arguments relating to God derived from it, see the wealth of texts to that effect from Pindar, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, and Philo, collected and translated by A.-J. Festugi?re in La r?v? lation d'Herm?s Trism?giste, vol. 2, Le Dieu cosmique (Paris: Gabalda, 1949), 80-91, 444-5, 543-4, 561, 610. According to Plato's Laws (903b-e), "God takes simultaneous care of the whole and of every detail in the whole" (p. 88). This second volume of Festugi?re's magnum opus contains still largely unexploited mines of information on other ways to God in ancient literature and philosophy, particularly in the early Aristotle (chiefly his Peri philoso phic^) and on Aristotle's influence in this regard. See also volume 4, Le Dieu inconnu et la gnose, for Plato especially. 13 For Aristotle "an endoxon that is shared by all men is ipso Jacto beyond challenge"; G. E. L. Owen, Tithenai ta phainomena, in Aristote et les pro bl?mes de m?thode, ed. Suzanne Mansion (Louvain, 1961), 90; cf. pp. 83-92. See also W. J. Verdenius, "Traditional and Personal Elements in Aristotle's Religion," Phronsis 5 (1960): 56-70.

If so, how could Aristotle have believed that God was an unmoved mover of the world? ... It is incredible that Aristotle should allow the bare solution to a dialectical puzzle to serve as one of the foundations of his entire metaphysical outlook. We do have before us a rich conception of God's relation to the world."15 Be that as it may, those who assign only self-knowledge to the divine vov? can still maintain that book 12 must just contradict eve rything else, including good sense. The chapters concerned need therefore to be gone into with care in order to see if this is true. In any case, there are greater and much more genuine difficulties that warrant such a venture. The central question is probably best for mulated by Plotinus: How can you eliminate all duality from a being whom you describe as thinking about himself? Can thought remain one and indivisible while considering itself? And if it is one and indivisible (as Aristotle insists God must be), how can it think of this indivisible which it itself must be? It would appear, says Plotinus, that the simplest (anXovoTarou) reality does not think of itself, for it would then be multiple. Hence it does not think of itself and one cannot think about it. "If anything is the simplest [?nkovorarou] of all, it will not possess thought of itself: for if it is to possess it, it will possess it by being multiple. It is not therefore thought, nor is there any thinking about it."16 I shall suggest in the following that this difficulty and its correlates are well foreseen by Aristotle, who is no less concerned than Plotinus to eliminate all duality from God. Aristotle's very careful progress in these chapters of book 12 (and others that their understanding pre supposes, for example, De Anima 3.6 on uorjotq and the indivisibles), provides the best answer to such difficulties. Whatever the answers, these and other related problems obvi ously require a fair actual reading of the relevant texts with a concern 15 Jonathan Lear, Aristotle: the Desire to Understand (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 1988), 300. Together with T. H. Irwin's Aristotle's First Principles (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), and Brague's Aristote (all three very different works), Lear's book must count among the best recent monographs on Aristotle. It contains the most intelligent recent treatment of Aristotle's God in my view, one of its outstanding merits being its grasp of the central significance of indivisibility in Aristotle's account. 16Enneads 5.3.49.13, trans.

Such aspects are quite beyond the scope of philology left to itself, a fortiori of mere musings. The quality of scholarship and the greater respect for philosophical form and content shown by many of the best interpreters of more recent years in the ever expanding field of Aristotelian studies will prove of considerable help. Forbidding though they may seem at first, it ought to become clear also that access to the higher flights of Met aphysics 12 is facilitated by their remarkable consistency with expla nations and clarifications provided throughout Aristotle's other works, as well as by his constant return to ordinary experience. II Guthrie rightly calls book 12 of the Metaphysics "the most mas terly exposition, in lecture-note form, of any left us by Aristotle."17 At the outset of Metaphysics 12.7 one is dealing with the primary source of all motion, the source that therefore moves without being moved and must be "eternal, substance and actuality" (1072a25-6). Chap ters 1 to 5 have summed up the essential prerequisites, which are more fully elaborated elsewhere, especially in the Physics. The causal role of the Prime Mover has been reaffirmed in chapter 4: "besides these there is that which as first of all things moves all things" (1070b34-5). Chapter 6 has shown that motion presupposes a cause whose very substance must be actuality (rj ovoia euepyeta; 1071b20) and without matter (auev uXr??; b21).18 17 Guthrie, History, 252. He adds, "it is a short, self-contained opuscu lum." On this insufficiently examined notion see W. J. Verdenius, "The Na ture of Aristotle's Scholarly Writings," in AWW, 1:12-21. I leave aside the notoriously uncertain questions of chronology. 18 Charles Kahn rightly points out that "in the order of knowability for us, metaphysics is the debtor to physics. But in the order of explanatory or intrinsic knowability (which is also the order of being or ousia) physics as the study of motion is essentially incomplete and must borrow its first prin ciple from the study of unmoving substance"; Charles Kahn, "On the Intended Interpretation of Aristotle's Metaphysics," in AWW, 1:325. It is worthy of notice that the first words of Metaphysics 12 are Ylepl tt)&lt;; ovoia? f] Oeujpia ("The subject of our inquiry is substance"; 12.1.1069al8). Small wonder, as a consequence, that the essential prerequisites recollected here (chapters 1</page><page sequence="9">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 479 How is the cause to move without being moved? Here is Aris totle's own summing up of his answer: And the object of desire [bpeKrbu] and the object of thought [uorjrbu] move in this way; they move without being moved. The primary objects of desire and of thought are the same. For the apparent good [^&gt;atvb\itvov KoCkbv] is the object of appetite \e-KiQv\ir)Tbv], and the real good [bu KaXbu] is the primary object of rational wish. But desire is consequent on opinion rather than opinion on desire: for the thinking is the starting-point [?pxfj y?p rj vbrjOL?]. And thought is moved by the object of thought, and one of the two columns of opposites [ovoroLxia] is in itself the object of thought; and in this, substance is first [f) ovo?a Trp?rr]], and in substance, that which is simple and exists actually. [The one [eu] and the simple [ol-kXovv] are not the same; for 'one' means a measure, but 'simple' means that the thing itself has a certain nature.) But the beautiful [?cotXbv], also, and that which is itself desirable [6C avrb aiperbv] are in the same column; and the first in any class is always best [apiorou ?el], or analogous to the best (12.7.1072a26-1072bl).19 5) are those that concern substance, in Physics 1, 7, and 8. The proof for the existence of an immobile, wholly unmoved substance that moves every thing and is eternal and without magnitude covers two full books of the Phys ics (Physics 7-8), and presupposes the various definitions and proofs of the six other books, not least book 6 on the quantitative parts of motion. The proof of the essential proposition, "everything that is in motion must be moved by something," is provided at the outset of book 7 by showing that anything in motion must have parts and is therefore dependent on these. As Kahn emphasizes, a number of propositions "baldly stated" in Metaphysics 12.6-7 are "argued at length in the physical treatises." See the De C?elo and De Generation et Corruption, besides the Physics; to which one should add the treatises on the living, De Anima, De Sensu, the various ones on animals, and so forth. Nor should the treatises of so-called practical philos ophy be forgotten: the two Ethics, and the Politics. What Metaphysics 12.6 7 add "are the specific contribution of First Philosophy"; Kahn, "Intended Interpretation," 318. All quotes from the Metaphysics will be from The Works of Aristotle, vol. 8, Metaphysica, trans. W. D. Ross (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1960). 19 De Anima (hereafter, "DA") 3.10 provides a more detailed analysis of the respective role of the two principles of motion, intellect (vov?) and desire (bpe?t?), the latter including the will or "rational wish" (?ovXqoic, cf. 433a23 5), as well as the essential terms of motion, the first of which, the unmoved mover, is the "practical good" (433bl6). For the text of De Anima, I use Aristotle, De Anima, ed. W. D. Ross (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961), indi cating a different reading adopted where necessary. Unless otherwise indi cated, I quote from D. W. Hamlyn, Aristotle's De Anima, Books II and III, with certain passages from Book I (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968). For an excellent discussion of perception and desire, and emotion and cognition with reference to the De Motu Animalium, the De Sensu, and the De Anima, see Martha C. Nussbaum and Hilary Putnam, "Changing Aristotle's Mind," in Es says on Aristotle's De Anima, ed. Martha C. Nussbaum and Am?lie O. Rorty (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), 37-41.</page><page sequence="10">480 THOMAS DE KONINCK Aristotle evidently wants to show that the Prime Mover is at once first "object of thought" and first "object of desire," and that this is how it moves.20 The very first object of "rational wish" (?ovXrjrou 6e TxpC?Tov) is the "real good" (ou kcxXov; 1072a28; cf. Bonitz: ipsum pulchrum?says Bonitz, "the beautiful itself"21). The principle of dis cernment between the latter and the "apparent good" (&lt;$&gt;aivb\ievov KaXbv; a28), is none other than thought or intellection, namely v?rjotc (cf. a30). Thus the order of goodness corresponds to that of intelli gibility. For among "objects of thought" some are principles of intel ligibility for others. Between, say, two opposites, one is always de fined by reference to the other, which is "in itself the object of thought." The full significance of this will be clearer further on. (It did not escape Hegel, whose exclamation?"one can hardly believe one's eyes"?is provoked by precisely this passage in Aristotle's ac count.)22 The word ovotoixiol evokes, of course, the Pythagorean table of contraries, but it is a leading theme in Aristotle that "in the list of contraries one of the two columns [r] erepa ovoroixia] is priv ative, and all contraries are reducible to being and non-being, and to unity and plurality."23 Among all "objects of thought," substance clearly comes first (ac cidents are all defined by reference to it). On the other hand, it is well-established that ubrjot?, thought, goes back to the simple, which 20 One should bear in mind that such terms as "object of thought," taken for convenience from the Ross translation, may bring in modern connotations that are somewhat foreign to Greek thought; the Greek text speaks quite naturally of vorjrbv, the "intelligible," referring directly to vov?, "intellect" or "mind." 21 Hermann Bonitz, Aristotelis Metaphysica Commentarius (1849; re print, Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1960), 496. KaXbu may also be translated, of course, as "the Good" (bonum). By retaining here its more literal meaning of pulchrum ("the Beautiful") Bonitz makes a fine point, warranted by the context. 22 To be exact, uo?]rr? ?? rj trepa ovoroixia Kaff avrfju (1072a30-l); translated "die andere Reihe an und f?r sich selbst" according to one version, and "das andere Co?lement [ovoroixia] an und f?r sich selbst" according to another.

Likewise, po tency is defined from act. Hence the first object of thought must be a simple substance existing actually (rj anXfj ko? kolt ev?pyeuxv; 1072a32). A parenthesis (a32-4) then underscores further still the meaning of "simple" (olitXovv), as describing substance itself. Furthermore, this first object of thought must also be the first object of desire. The beautiful or the good, that which is in itself desirable, belong to the same series (eu ttj avry; ovotolxW) a35). Since "the first in any class is always best, or analogous to the best," it follows that simple substance, actual and first object of thought, is what is best of all and therefore first object of desire. In a word, the first source of all motion is not only unmoved, "eternal, substance, and actuality," as was pointed out at the outset. It is in addition the indivisible principle of all intelligibility, that is, first object of thought, and principle of all goodness, that is, the good or the beautiful par excellence: it is not only to ou kolXou, "real good," but the first good and therefore the best and most perfect. Following immediately upon these are the famous lines (1072b 1-13) in which Aristotle explains the teleological causality of goodness. They begin with an important distinction reiterated at least five times in the Ar istotelian corpus which reads as follows: "That a final cause [to ov eveKct] may exist among unchangeable entities is shown by the dis tinction of its meanings. For the final cause is (a) some being for whose good an action is done [tlu?], and (b) something at which the action aims [tluo?]; and of these the latter exists among unchangeable entities though the former does not. The final cause, then, produces motion as being loved [Ktuei be ?? epCo\ieuou], but all other things move by being moved" (1072b!-4).25 24 See DA 3.6.430a26-b4, notably the example of Empedocles' zoogony. 25 Cf. K. Gaiser, Das zweifache Telos bei Aristoteles, in Naturphilosophie bei Aristoteles und Theophrast, ed. Ingemar During (Heidelberg: Lothar Stiehm Verlag, 1969), 97-113; particularly 100-3, 110-11, 113. Gaiser has shown (1) that the series of opposites (ovoToix?a) is again illustrated here; and (2) that it recalls Diotima's speech in Plato's Symposium (cf. 210e, and 204d-205a; and Lysis 218d-222a). The phrase avrb to KaXbv signifies beauty or the good itself, on the one hand; on the other, all things desiring it. Gaiser further analyzes five texts in the Aristotelian corpus, including this one, where this distinction between two meanings of "that for the sake of which" is central: the four others are EE 8.3.1249bl5; DA 2.4.415b2-3 and 415b20-l; and Physics 2.2.194a35-6. Three of these concern God, whose perfection causes all becoming (see p. 111). To this must be added a frag</page><page sequence="12">482 THOMAS DE KONINCK That is to say, the simple, perfect substance just described exer cises the highest form of causality without ever changing. It is through desire that what is good moves. "But the eternally noble and that which is truly and primarily good, and not good at one time but not at another, is too divine and too honorable to be relative to any thing else. The first mover, then, imparts movement without being moved, and desire and the faculty of desire impart movement while being themselves moved."26 Hence, a little farther on in the same chapter of the Metaphysics: "On such a principle, then, depend the heavens and the world of na ture" (1072M3-14). "On such a principle" refers to 1072b7-8 and 10-11: "But since there is something which moves while itself un moved, existing actually [euepyeiq ou], this can in no way be otherwise than it is." It exists, in other words, "of necessity" (the meanings of necessary are given out again in bll-13). Insofar as it does so it is KaX??: "its mode of being is good, and it is in this sense a first prin ciple" (ko? ovtlu? oipxr\\ bll). There is no room here for comment on these splendid develop ments except to agree with G?nther Patzig when he reports that "the journey to the highest principles and causes, which Aristotle has so energetically pursued from the beginning of the Metaphysics, is here at last completed in a few giant strides." The word npuoTou, "first"? beginning with "first object of thought," as we have seen?plays a central role; indeed, the good (or the beautiful) itself is described as par excellence ixpC?Tou. Again, Patzig's words, a few lines later, can hardly be improved upon: "The substance of the first mover is ment from the Peri philosophias; see Aristotelis Fragmenta selecta, ed. W. D.

Aristotle is only consistent when, immediately after this proof (XII, 7, 1072b 14), he turns to the exposition of the intellectual activity and the happiness of the divine substance. We can now say that this exposition is the kernel of his ontology; for theology and ontology are paronymously interrelated in just the way in which their objects, the prime mover and being as such, are. The very name of first philosophy' gives us an indication of how closely it is related to that high object."27 Ill But why "a thinking of thinking"? What must the divine life itself be like? Aristotle says that "it is a life such as the best which we eryoy," albeit, in our case, briefly (1072M4-18). The most eiyoyable life for us is found in perception and thought when they are fully awak ened and we are fully conscious of them, as is clear from Nicomachean Ethics 9.9. The chief part of human life is activity: eu tx? euepye?q (1170al8).28 For the onovoaloc, the good man, life is good and en joyable. Now to live and to be conscious of living are but one thing? we perceive that we perceive, think that we think (Kau uoupteu, otl 27 Cf.

Full activity here is most pleasurable, for to the good man existence itself is good (cf. 1170b4), and perception of what is in itself good is naturally pleas ant. Hence the great pleasure we take in contemplation, even at the sense level, which is manifest in the sharing of it in communication and in friendship proper (cf. 1170bll-14). By contrast with ours, divine life is perpetual wakefulness (biayuyfj; 1072b 14; ?el; bl5), pure joy.29 The central notion here is of course pleasure, which, it must be remembered, is not in Aristotle's view a process; its form is "complete at any given moment" (JEW 10.4.1174b5-6); it is comparable in that respect to the act of seeing, which is "regarded as complete at any moment of its duration, because it does not lack anything that, realized later, will perfect its specific quality. Now pleasure also seems to be of this nature, because it is a sort of whole" (1174al4-17). A movement is not complete at any given time, "whereas pleasure is something that is whole and com plete" (1174b7); it is instantaneous, and that which is "in the now" (eu r? uvu) is a whole (b9). Among the fine lines of Metaphysics 9.6 that were restored by Bonitz we read, "At the same time [apbct] we are seeing and have seen, are understanding and have understood, are thinking and have thought (while it is not true that at the same time we are learning and have learnt, or are being cured and have been cured)" (1048b23-5). Process, or movement (klutjolc) is, of course, imperfect actuality (aTeXrj?; Physics 3.2.291b31-2), which ceases to be when its end has been reached; whereas the actuality here de scribed is itself its own end and is at once all it can be (cf. Metaphysics 9.8.1050a21-3). To quote Victor Golschmidt, "Un tel acte est d'em bl?e tout ce qu'il peut ?tre. Sa fin lui est immanente, et lui-m?me est immanent ? l'agent."30 All of this makes perfect sense of the remark 29 The exact meaning and connotations of biayuyf) are very well ex plained in Brague, Aristote, 437-46, who traces the theme back to the Pro trepticus: see pp. 82-9; "l'amour naturel de la veille est un amour de la v?rit?"

That is why God eryoys one simple pleasure for ever. For there is an activity not only of movement but also one of immo bility; and there is a truer pleasure in rest than in motion" (EN 7.14.1154b24-8). In a word, the higher the actuality, the more perfect and the greater the joy. The primary cause, we have just seen, is substance, actuality and nothing but actuality (cf. Metaphysics, 1071b20). The highest actuality is that of the intellect or of thought (uov?), since it is thinking, we have also just seen (cf. apxf] y?p r] uorjotc; 1072a30), that understands the simple, the actual, the first object of thought and the first object of desire, the beautiful or the real good. Hence the lines that follow at 1072bl8-19: "And thinking in itself deals with that which is best in itself, and that which is thinking in the fullest sense with that which is best in the fullest sense." Aristotle then goes on to say, And thought thinks on itself because it shares the nature of the object of thought; for it becomes an object of thought in coming into contact with and thinking [Oiyy?uuu Kai uo?u; 1072b21] its objects, so that thought and object of thought are the same. For that which is capable of receiving the object of thought, i.e. the essence, is thought [Kai tt)? ovoia? uov?-, b22]. But it is active when it possesses this object. There fore the possession rather than the receptivity is the divine element which thought seems to contain, and the act of contemplation is what is most pleasant and best. If, then, God is always in that good state in which we sometimes are, this compels our wonder; and if in a better this compels it yet more. And God is in a better state. And life also belongs to God; for the actuality of thought is life, and God is that actuality; and God's self-dependent actuality is life most good and eternal. We say both Ross and Jaeger. See Brague, Aristote, 454-76. Cf. De Sophisticis Elenchis 22.178a9; De Sensu 6.446b2; and EN 10.4.1174al7-23: "at no mo ment in time can one fasten upon a pleasure the prolongation of which will enable its specific quality to be perfected. For this reason pleasure is not a process; because every process is in time, and has an end (e.g. the process of building), and is complete when it has accomplished its object. Thus it is complete either in the whole of the time that it takes or at the instant of reaching its end. The particular processes that take place in the parts of this time are all incomplete, and different in kind from the whole and from one another."

Bambrough (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1965), 121-41; and G?rard Verbeke, "L'argument du livre VII de la Physique," in Naturphilosophie bei Aristoteles und Theophrast, 250-67, esp. 254-61.</page><page sequence="16">486 THOMAS DE KONINCK therefore that God is a living being, eternal, most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal belong to God; for this is God. (1072M9-30) In the strict sense, most remarkably, the word Oeupia, "contempla tion," means the actual exercise of knowledge, and it appears always to signify some actual knowing.31 These lines bring up again the fa mous teachings of the Aristotelian Ethics on contemplation, including the "contemplation of God" (tov deov Oeupiau) described at the con clusion of the Eudemian Ethics (8.3.1249b 13-21) as the best mode and the finest standard for human life.32 In a splendid passage of the Nicomachean Ethics (10.7.1177b26-1178a8) Aristotle urges us to live the life of the divine element in us, the intellect, even if between human and divine activity there is only "some likeness" of such activity (optotupi? t?) EN 10.8.1178b27).33 The fact remains that Oeupia tov 31 See John Dudley, "La contemplation (the?ria) humaine selon Aris tote," Revue philosophique de Louvain 80, no. 47 (1982): 387-413, particu larly 388-392; and Gott und The?ria bei Aristoteles: Die metaphysische Grundlage der Nikomachischen Ethik (Bern: Peter Lang, 1981). 32 Aristotle explains in his conclusion to the Eudemian Ethics that "whatever mode of choosing and of acquiring things good by nature? whether goods of the body or wealth or friends or the other goods?will best promote the contemplation of God [tov Oeov Oeupiav], that is the best mode, and that standard is the finest; and any mode of choice and acquisition that either through deficiency or excess hinders us from serving and from contem plating God?that is the bad one"; EE 8.3.1249M7-21, trans. H. Rackham, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961). Olof Gigon is right, I think: "Ausserdem kommt es sicherlich vor, da? Aristoteles sich ?ber den Gegenstand des theorein und noein des Menschen nicht naeher auessert. Hier aber wird dieser Gegenstand mit aller Deutlichkeit genannt: ho theos"; Olaf Gigon, Zwei Interpretationen zur Endemischen Ethik des Aristoteles, in Museum Helveticum 26 (1969): 214.

Ver denius reestablishes a much more satisfactory text from attempts to remove or change various occurrences of the word Oeb? in that work; along the same lines, cf., in the same volume, E. Berti (192-184), G. Verbeke (154) and C. J. Rowe (85-87). 33 Kahn draws a list of objections to "the prevailing view" that "the divine nous knows nothing of the world order" derived from precisely these analo gies between human Oeupia and divine vbrjoL?. For instance: "The more completely a human being engages in noetic contemplation, the more fully he grasps the formal structure of the cosmos. If the divine represents the goal to which human thought at its best aspires, surely the divine must grasp the whole of this structure rather than none of it!"; Kahn, "Intended Interpre tation," 327 n. 24.

The Nicomachean Ethics is clear: "The activity of God, which is supremely happy, must be a form of contemplation" (EN 10.8.1178b21-2). The activity of each of the senses was said to be perfect when it is in good condition and directed towards the highest, or "most beautiful" (KaXXtoTow, 1174bl5), the best (kpoltiotow, bl9) of its objects; it will then be "most perfect and most pleasurable" (b20). Thought and contemplation will likewise be "most perfect and most pleasurable," repeats Aristotle, when directed to the worthiest (oirov?aLOTcxTou) of its objects (cf. b21-3). That having been said, "it is evident?as Themistius stresses in his Commentary to Lambda? that the Intellect has much greater joy and delight than the senses (rejoicing) in their perceptions. For (the Intellect) intellects that which is more excellent than the other perceptions (namely) Himself and His own existence."34 losophie 25, no. 2 (1983): 126-137, for a remarkable outline of the moral ideal according to Aristotle. One may wonder, along with the author (pp. 131? 132), at the persistent attempt by scholars like von Arnim to alter, against manuscript evidence, such particularly explicit texts as those of the Eude mian Ethics. For an excellent discussion of this see Anthony Kenny, The Aristotelian Ethics (Oxford, 1978), 173-8. Von Arnim, "at the cost of a manipulation of the text of which there are but few examples" (Vianney D? carie, in his annotated translation into French of EE [Paris, J. Vrin/PUM, 1978], 222 n. 80), had decided, for 1249a21-b25, to read vov? ("intellect") wherever manuscripts had debq ("God"), in order to eliminate any reference to a tran scendant God. "The proposal has no support from any manuscript or ver sion, and is implausible in itself'; Kenny, 174. Von Arnim also changed Oepaneveiu ("serve" [God]) into euepyelu; Dirlmeier would reduce Qeb? to the OeuprjTLKbu, namely, a human faculty of divine character, Oeiou, or "god in us." But the context is formal and does not allow these reductions. See also, against these, the refutations by Gigon and by Verdenius referred to in the previous note. Other texts in the Ethics more directly concerned with the divine, or with God, are again JEW 10.8.1178b28-32, and ?AT 10.7.1177al2 1178a8; cf. 10.4.1174bl5-23.

We just saw that for Aristotle self-awareness is in dispensable for a good life, as is best shown in JEW 9.9 and EE 7.12 regarding friendship.35 The long passage just quoted from Metaphys ics 12.7 (especially 1072bl9-23) clearly refers as well to teachings developed at greater length in the De Anima. The famous, extraor dinary statements spring to mind: "Actual knowledge is identical with its object" (repeated twice word for word: DA 3.5.430al9-20; 3.7.431al-2). "In general, the intellect in activity is its objects" (7.431bl7). More literally, the mind, that which thinks, uov?, is things (-KpaypuxTcx). Chapter 4 (429b9) specifies that the intellect can "think itself" (avTou uoeiu)36 once it "has become each thing in the way that one who actually knows is said to do so" (b5-7).37 Aristotle raises, in the latter part of DA 3.4 (429b22-430a9), two aporiae which are germane to the questions we mentioned at the 35 For an excellent analysis of this point and of the role of the Good even in Metaphysics 12.7 and 9, see Horst Seidl, "Aristoteles' Lehre von der ubrjoi? vofjoeL?c des ersten, g?ttlichen Vernunftwesens und ihre Darstellung bei Plotin," in AWW, 2:157-76, esp. 159-62.

As Charles Kahn says, "there is no justification for Bywater's emendation at 429b9, which replaces avTou voelu by a pointless repetition of ?tavrov uoelu from 429b7. The theme of self-cognition, introduced here, prepares for the aporia developed later in this chapter (429b26-9). In Ross's text this connection is lost"; "Aristotle on Thinking," in Essays on Aristotle's De Anima, ed. Martha C. Nussbaum and Am?lie O. Rorty (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), 373 n. 27. 37 See Jonathan Lear, "Active Episteme," in Mathematics and Meta physics in Aristotle: Akten des X. Symposium Aristotelicum, ed. Andreas Graeser (Berne-Stuttgart: Paul Haupt, 1987), 149-174. It is noteworthy that for Hegel, this actual identity of "object" and thinking is the "chief moment" of Aristotelian philosophy: "Das Hauptmoment in der Aristotelischen Philo sophie ist, dass das Denken und das Gedachte eins ist,?dass das Objective und das Denken (die Energie) ein und dasselbe ist"; Hegel, Vorlesungen, 162 3. Richard Rorty has emphasized that, instead of "the subject's becoming identical with the object," the notion usually taken for granted since Des cartes is of "representations which are in the 'mind' "; so that knowledge becomes "the possession of accurate representations of an object"; Philos ophy and the Mirror of Nature (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1980), 45. "Once Descartes had entrenched this way of speaking it was possible for Locke to use 'idea' in a way which has no Greek equivalent at all" (p. 48). Charles Taylor offers a most enlightening discussion of two modern perspectives thus utterly different from the one we see in Aristotle, "Descartes's Disengaged Reason" and "Locke's Punctual Self'; see Charles Taylor, Sources of the Self (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 143-76, 538-44.</page><page sequence="19">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 489 outset. The first (429b22-5) is this: Since it is airXovu (simple, indi visible) and a-KaO'e? (impassible), and since it has nothing in common with anything (as Anaxagoras says), how will the intellect think? The second is: "Can it itself be thought?" (b 26). We will return to the first aporia later. The answer to the second reads as follows: "And it is itself an object of thought, just as its objects are. For, in the case of those things which have no matter, that which thinks and that which is thought are the same; for contemplative knowledge and that which is known in that way are the same" (430a2-5). In Metaphysics 12.7 Aristotle sums that up in less than three lines (1072M9-21). Given that intellect and what it thinks are one in the very act of thinking, the intellect itself becomes intelligible in that same act. Here, however, Aristotle adds the word 6tyy?uuu (b21), evoking contact and the sense of touch, just as he does earlier con cerning thought of incomposites (9.10.1051b24-5). One of the many contributions of Brague's book on Aristotle has been to bring this out, showing how the sense of touch?and not sight, as is usually said? is "un analogue privil?gi? de l'intellect."38 When I feel this object in my hand, I am simultaneously aware of myself as distinct from it and sense it as at once present and external. Hence no doubt the prover bial certainty of touch. Whereas light, the medium indispensable to vision, is "not strictly speaking visible in itself, but because of the colour of something else" (DA 2.7.418b5-6), in the case of touch, "that medium which enables us to perceive is itself perceptible, is internal to us"; it is our body, our flesh.39 Touching is accordingly more like thinking than even seeing because of its self-awareness while sensing. Other common traits would doubtless be intimacy and sureness: ubr]OL? cannot err in its first grasp of the indivisible, according to DA 3.6.430a26-7. Error always comes from "composition," synthesis: to y?p if/ev?o? eu ovu0?oet ae? (430bl-2). Similarly, according to Metaphysics 9.10.1051bl7-27 on "incomposites" (?ovuOrjTct), "con tact [?tyelu] and assertion are truth (assertion not being the same as affirmation), and ignorance is non-contact [/jltj Otyyauetu]. For it is not possible to be in error regarding the question what a thing is, save in an accidental sense; and the same holds good regarding 38 See Brague, Aristote, 369-373; cf. pp. 259-261.

Now the object of thought in question in Metaphysics 12.7 is ovoia, substance (translated by Ross here as "essence"; cf. 1072b22).40 Its actual possession gives the intellect its dignity, indeed its "divine" character (b22-3). As was pointed out some time ago by D. M. MacKinnon, "it is impossible to understand at all Aristotle's conception of God without some grasp of what he means by substance"; here Aristotle is "stressing the fact that God in a way unique among sub stances exists of himself."41 In lines 1072b26-30 (the last of the long quote above) he then describes the actuality of thought which is God as life and life most good and eternal. A fundamental proposition from the De Anima is at play here: "For living things it is living that is existing" (to eluai, their being; 2.4.415M3)?the proposition is bet ter known in its Latin version: vivere viventibus est esse.42 The activ ity of intellect is a form of life (cf. DA 2.2.413a22-3); in fact its best form is perpetual wakefulness, uninterrupted 9eupia, as we saw. The very being of the first substance of which we were speaking, since it 40 Bonitz understands it as meaning to t? rju eiuai; see his Aristotelis Metaphysica, 501. One may recall that it is with regard to the same that, if one is to believe De Anima 3.6.430b27-8, vov? is always right. As to the translation of ovoia the following remarks by Pierre Aubenque are relevant: "J'ai essay? autrefois (Le probl?me de l'?tre. . . , passim) de traduire toiyours ousia par 'essence', mais je dois avouer que cette traduction ne rend pas la connotation 'substrative' souvent pr?sente dans ousia. J'en reviens donc ? la traduction traditionnelle par 'substance' en me r?servant d'employer 'es sence' lorsque le contexte le justifie et de rappeler aussi souvent qu'il est n?cessaire que ousia d?rive de einai"; Pierre Aubenque, "Plotin et Dexippe, Ex?g?tes des Cat?gories d'Aristote," in Aristot?lica: M?langes offerts ?

Renford Bambrough (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1965), 103, 112. He rightly points out also that "the kinds of criticism of the Aristotelian conception of substance which stem from the well-known passages in Locke's Essay on Human Understanding dealing with the substratum are hopelessly wide of the mark. . . . Berkeley dis played a much fuller sense ... of the centrality to the notion of substance, of the conception of self-existence. . . . Yet Locke's influence on the proper evaluation of the notion of substance in British philosophy has been disas trous" (p. 114). 42 See Brague, Aristote, 99-102. On the great theme of God as tjjji], life, (to which it is impossible to do justice here) see Franco Volpi, "La d?termi nation aristot?licienne du principe divin comme C,ujfj (Met, A, 7, 1072b26 30)," Les Etudes philosophiques, no. 3 (1991), 369-87. Cf. also Aristotle, De C?elo 2.3.286a8-10.</page><page sequence="21">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 491 must be the best life, has to be the very act of uninterrupted thinking. This appears indeed to be how ordinary humans see it, adds Aristotle, for we say of God that he is a living being, eternal, most good, or perfect. In other words, life itself and "duration continuous and eter nal" belong to Him. To repeat, then, "God is perpetual life" means God is undivided thought, forever actual. Furthermore, and most im portantly, this appears to be confirmed for Aristotle by common hu man conceptions on the subject.43 Richard Bod??s is probably right: "Aristote entend ?tablir ici que la nature de la premi?re substance, telle qu'il vient de la d?crire, correspond exactement ? la conception qu'un chacun poss?de de l'?tre divin."44 Chapter 7 ends with two clarifications. The first chides the Py thagoreans and Speusippus for supposing "that supreme beauty and goodness are not present" in the first principle (1072b35-1073a3). The second reads: It is clear then from what has been said that there is a substance which is eternal and immovable and separate from sensible things. It has been shown also that this substance cannot have any magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible (for it produces movement through infinite time, but nothing finite has infinite power, and, while every magnitude is either infi nite or finite, it cannot, for the above reason, have finite magnitude, and it cannot have infinite magnitude because there is no infinite magnitude at all). But it has also been shown that it is impassive and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior to change of place (1073a3-ll). 43 It will be clear that at 1072b281 read &lt;t&gt;apeu be (instead of 6fj, proposed by Bonitz, followed by both Ross and Jaeger, without the support of manu scripts). According to R. Walzer, "whether Themistius can be referred to in support of 6fj [cf. Ross' apparatus] is doubtful but not impossible"; see Richard Walzer, "On the Arabic Versions of books A, a, &amp; A of Aristotle's Metaphysics," in Richard Walzer, Greek into Arabic (Cambridge: Harvard Uni versity Press, 1962), 122-3. 44 Richard Bod??s, "En marge de la th?ologie aristot?licienne," Revue philosophique de Louvain, no. 73 (1975): 22-3. That this God, np?rr) ovo?a, pure actuality, soon to be called vorjoeu? ubrjou;, and so forth, should so satisfy common notions associated with divinity?eternity, perfect hap piness, omnipotence (cf. pp. 17-20)?does seem to corroborate, for Aristotle, his more "scientific" conclusions. Ingemar During expresses this aspect of the Aristotelian method very well: "He thus unites in his thought an invariably sober 'common-sense' with an abstraction pushed to its extreme limits"; Ingemar During, Aristoteles, 210. "One keeps discovering anew that even for his most extraordinarily abstract theories, Aristotle starts from simple facts of experience. I believe this to be the case also with the theory of ubrjot? uofjoeuj?" (p. 220).</page><page sequence="22">492 THOMAS DE KONINCK Roughly paraphrased, the argument seems to run as follows. It is now manifest that there exists an external unmoved substance, not per ceptible to sense. It has also been proved (see Physics 8.10.267bl7 26) that it is impossible for that substance to have any magnitude at all; it must be without parts and indivisible. Nothing finite can have an unlimited force, infinite power (bvuapau aneipou; 1073a8; cf. Physics 267b22-3). Every magnitude is either infinite or finite. That sub stance cannot, then, be finite, for the reason given?namely, nothing finite has infinite power?but it has infinite power. Nor can it be in finite in the quantitative sense, since no infinite magnitude can actually exist (cf. Physics 3.5; Metaphysics 9.6.1048b 14-17). It must therefore be "indivisible, without parts and without magnitude" (abia?peTou eoTi Kai ?ptep?? Kai ovbeu exou pt?yeOo?; Physics 8.10.267b25-6 [the last lines of the entire treatise]), while its power is infinite.45 IV The expression ubrjotc uorjoeu? occurs explicitly in Metaphysics 12.9, in a concluding sentence (1074b33-5): "Therefore it must be of itself that the divine thought thinks (since it is the most excellent of things), and its thinking is a thinking on thinking [Kai eoriu r? u?rjotc; uofjoeujq ubr^oL?]." In its opening sentence, the chapter acknowledges that difficulties subsist regarding divine thought (cf. 1074bl5-17). The question is, How can the activity of that substance held to be the most divine make it so? You cannot say the divine intellect thinks of nothing, like someone asleep, nor that it thinks of something other than itself, because this implies imperfection, or potency, dependence on something else. As we just saw again, it must be pure actuality, the best form of life, perpetual wakefulness, and so on. Should it depend for thought on something other, its very own substance would no longer be the act of thinking (ubr/etc), but a potency (?vuapu?)? which will hardly do for the best substance (1074b20), whose dignity, as we saw also, is owed to actual thinking (b21). 45 See Andr? Doz, La logique de Hegel et les probl?mes traditionnels de l'ontologie (Paris: J. Vrin, 1987), 68 n. 32. As he says further, "Le fait demeure que la puissance infime lui est attribu?. . . . Ces traits n?gatifs?indivisible, sans parties, sans grandeur?, vus ? partir de Hegel, mais non seulement ? partir de lui, sont l'index de la spiritualit?" (p. 68).</page><page sequence="23">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 493 What, then, does it think? "Either itself or something else; and if something else, either the same thing always or something different" (1074b22-3; slightly altering Ross). Does it really matter what? What difference does it make, whether it is the good (to KaXbu; b24) which it thinks or any chance thing? The answer is that there are some things which it is obviously absurd to meditate upon (biauoeioOai; b25). It must be evident that the first substance must think what is most divine and of the greatest worth (b25-6). Nor will it change (b26)?to answer the query: does it think something differ ent? Any change from the most divine and precious would inevitably be for the worse, besides implying movement where it was proved there can be no movement (b26-7).46 To return to the questions raised: supposing the divine thought not to be actual thinking (uotjolc) but a potency (byuapac, 1074b28), the continuity of its thinking would be wearisome (b29). Moreover, since in that case it would need to be actualized by an object of thought other than itself, that object would hence be of greater worth, or no bility, than the intellect in question. Its dependence would be such that even the most unworthy objects of thought?things one prefers to avoid looking at?even those would acquire the status of actuality with regard to it. Whatever actualizes something is, to that extent, more noble than that which it actualizes. The uorjotc then would not be apLOTou, the "best of things" (b33). But God, we saw, must be to ou KaXbu, perfection itself. In Richard Norman's words, "If it is bvuapac;, that which it thinks is better than the [prime mover] itself." To this one should add that even the worst object of thought would then be better in that regard, for it would be actual with respect to the prime mover. It makes no sense to reduce divine ubrjot? to potency, for it would make its dignity depend on the dignity of what actual izes it.47 46 See also De C?elo 1.9.279a30-bl: "In the more popular philosophical works, where divinity is in question, it is often made abundantly clear by the discussion that the foremost and highest divinity must be entirely immutable, a fact which affords testimony to what we have been saying. For there is nothing superior that can move it?if there were it would be more divine? and it has no badness in it nor is lacking [ev?e??] in any of the fairness proper to it [tCju avTov KaXoju]"; Aristotle, On the Heavens, trans. W. K. C. Guthrie, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1960). 47 Cf. Norman, "Aristotle's Philosopher-God," 71; Aquinas, In Metaph. 12, lect. 11, n. 2612 (Marietti); Themistius: "If Its intellectum were some thing extraneous to it, [this intellectum] would be nobler and more excel lent [than the Intellect]. For it would be the cause of the Intellect's</page><page sequence="24">494 THOMAS DE KONINCK The conclusion, quoted already, is that it must think itself, since it is KpaTLOTou, "the most excellent of things," and its ubrjou;, "think ing," is a uofjoeuq uorjotq, "thinking on thinking" (1074b33-34). This raises a new problem. It would appear that science, sensation, opin ion, and discursive thought are always concerned with some other thing, and with themselves concomitantly (eu napepyi^; b36). (We alluded to this earlier referring to EN 1170a32: we perceive that we perceive while seeing this color or hearing this sound, for instance, and think that we think while thinking of this or that.) Further, given that to think and to be thought are distinct, as they seem to be at least by definition, to which of the two would the excellence we were speak ing of belong?to ubr/ot? or to uorjoeujq? (cf. 1074b36-38). We were reminded above that science is, in certain cases, the thing known: in the productive sciences, omitting the matter, it is the substance and the essence (rj ovoia Kai to t? r?u eluat);48 in the theo retical sciences, the definition, the thing and the thinking (rj uotjolc) are but one (1074b38-1075a3). This is so a fortiori in the present case. "Since, then, thought and the object of thought are not different in the case of things that have no matter, the divine thought and its object will be the same, i.e. the thinking will be one with the object of its thought" (1075a3-5). Chapter 9 concludes with one last?and most important?ques tion. Is the object of divine thought composite (ovuOeTou)? This would imply that "thought would change in passing from part to part of the whole" (1075a6), which was excluded by eliminating from the first substance any change whatever. Moreover, "everything that has intellecting. . . . Everything that exists in consequence of [having] some thing other than itself as its cause is inferior to the thing that is posited as being its cause. Thus the Intellect would be in potentia. . . . We shall say that He intellects the things that are of the utmost excellence. If He were to intellect inferior things, He would derive His nobility from inferior things. This [conclusion] must be avoided"; trans. Pines, "Metaphysical Conceptions," 183. "At turpe absurdumque est poner? substantiam talem et simul statuere, ut ante se honorabilius quidpiam digniusque habeat"; Themistius, in CAG, vol. 5, pt. 4, p. 31.27-9. 48 See the explanations in Metaphysics 7.7; for example, 1032M0-14: "The process from this point onward, i.e. the process towards health, is called a 'making'. Therefore it follows that in a sense health comes from health and house from house, that with matter from that without matter; for the medical art and the building art are the form of health and of the house, and when I speak of substance without matter I mean the essence [Xeyu be ovoiav avev vXrj? to t? r\u eiuat]."</page><page sequence="25">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 495 not matter is indivisible" (a7). Finally, whereas the human intellect? at any rate its thought of composite things?can reach what is best for it only after a certain time?neither in this part nor in that one, but as to a whole distinct from it?divine thought thinking itself enjoys this best throughout eternity (cf. 1075a7-10). To sum up, none of the alternatives mentioned in chapter 9 ex clude knowledge. The fact of thinking the other first in no way ex cludes self-knowledge; it in fact includes it concomitantly, eu n?pepyctj. Does knowing itself not concomitantly but directly exclude from the divine intellect any other knowledge?at the very least con comitantly, as Gadamer observes?49 The word "only" is a typically unfortunate gloss, nowhere to be seen here in Aristotle.50 Neither in chapters 7 or 9, nor anywhere else in Aristotle for that matter, does knowledge of one reality, for instance, of self, entail ignorance of an other. This is so least of all?oddly enough?in the case of opposites, as was seen above in chapter 7 (1072a30-l) and will be obvious again further on. What we did see Aristotle deny is the attribution of any form what ever of potency, of want or d?pendance, to God. To attribute ignorance under any form to God would clearly on Aristotle's principles be to in troduce back into God what he has denied, namely, potency?imperfec tion, a contradiction in terms when speaking of the most perfect being. Ignorance is invariably a want, a privation of knowledge. What is per fect, "complete and whole" (TeXetou Kai oXou) is defined by Aristotle as "that which has nothing outside it," "that from which nothing is want ing."51 In order to understand his view of God?or any such view, for that matter, as Xenophanes first brought out so well?one must avoid 49 Hans-Georg Gadamer, in a letter to Klaus Oehler reprinted in an Ap pendix to Oehler's Unbewegte Beweger: "Das eu irap'epyu) das mir so wes entlich scheint, mit der uofjot? avrfj? vereinbar" (p. 120). ? 50 That the either/or formulated by Ross is not in Aristotle is shown by Richard Norman in his "Aristotle's Philosopher-God." As for Oehler, see once more Gadamer: "Von da aus habe ich auch meine Zweifel, ob die Alternative, in der Sie sich f?r die 'abstrakte' Selbsreferenz entscheiden . . . , ?berhaubt korrekt ist"; in Oehler, Unbewegte Beweger, 120. 51 Cf.

Jonathan Barnes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), vol. 1.</page><page sequence="26">496 THOMAS DE KONINCK fabricating a quid imaginatum. One instance of such an imaginary representation would surely be the fantasy that a pure actuality such as God would be limited to itself by its very perfection! Unless I misunderstand him such is, however, the opinion of at least one eminent Aristotelian scholar: If as with Aristotle a separate substance is a finite form, it is obviously not all other things or any other thing. It is limited to itself. To become and be anything else in cognition, it would have to undergo change. But it has no potentiality for change whatever. Accordingly it is unable to know anything other than itself. . . . Because of its complete actuality it is limited to its own form and consequently to cognition of itself alone. . . . But is not separate substance the primary instance of being? In knowing itself, then, should it not thereby know all the secondary instances that exemplify it and imitate it? Does it not as primary in stance contain all the perfection that is merely shared by the secondary instances? This reasoning would hold if Aristotelian separate substance were infinite in being. As infinite, it would contain within itself all other beings. In knowing itself it would know them. But in point of fact it is finite. It contains only its own perfection, not the perfections of other things. In knowing itself it does not know them.52 One could not, I submit, be more completely mistaken. It is ac tuality (or form) that defines potency, never the opposite. The more perfect the form, the less it excludes and the more perfections, or other forms, it contains. The most patent text, to which authors as diverse as G?nther Patzig, Ingemar During, and Thomas Aquinas rightly refer,53 reads, "the soul is in a way all existing things" (r? if/yxv r? buTa irui? 52 Joseph Owens, "The Relation of God to World in the Metaphysics," in EMA (see note 9 above), 219-20. He adds: "For Aristotle the finitude of pure actuality does not allow even the knowledge of something else that might serve as the basis for a real relation to that thing" (p. 229 n. 26). Cf. p. 213: "In any case, an immaterial form is regarded by Aristotle as something finite, not infinite" (referring, for instance, to Metaphysics 1.5.986b 18-21). Similar confusions (cf. notes 53-57 below) are implicit in Klaus Oehler's statement, "The Divine Mind is so perfect that it can only know itself'; "Self-Knowledge," 502; Unbewegte Beweger, 85. 53 G?nther Patzig, "Discussion," in EMA, 226; During, Aristoteles, 47: "Daher ist das Denken gewissermassen die Gesamtheit der Dinge"; cf. p. 580. See also Thomas Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles 1. chap. 44, n. 377: "Inter perfectiones autem rerum potissima est quod aliquid sit intellectivum: nam per hoc ipsum est quodammodo omnia" (referring to De Anima 3.8.431b21); cf. SCG 3, chap. 112, n. 2860: "unaquaeque intellectualis sub stantia est quodammodo omnia, inquantum totius entis comprehensiva est suo intellectu."</page><page sequence="27">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 497 eoTi n?ura; DA 3.8.431b21), more specifically their forms: "for it is not the stone which is in the soul, but its form" (431b29).54 It is, says Aristotle, "as the hand is; for the hand is a tool of tools, and the intellect [uov?] a form of forms" (eibo? eib?u; 432a2). If our intellect is a form of forms, a fortiori so is the divine uov?. In fact for Aristotle it is matter?potency?which excludes, al ways accompanied as it is by privation (as he will repeat at Meta physics 12.10.1075b21-4). The actual exclusion of contraries takes place when the immediate subject is material. Hot chases cold from my hand, not from my thought.55 One ought not be misled by the connotations of the word "finite" or its equivalents in modern lan guages. If you translate reXeiou or its synonyms here by "finite," you must keep in mind that what is meant is "perfect,"56 namely, again, "that from which nothing is wanting." For Aristotle, Parmenides, who claimed that being was "finite" (TreTrepaopteuou), spoke better than Melissus, who claimed that being was "infinite" (aneipou).57 "The 54 Cf. Heinrich Cassirer, Aristoteles' Schrift "Von der Seele" und ihre Stel lung innerhalb der aristotelischen Philosophie (T?bingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1932; reprint, Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1968), 83-6, 157-162, 192-3. See also Brague, Aristote, 343-357. Brague notices (p. 351) that "all" comes up five times in the six first lines of DA 3.5 on the agent intellect. 55 Brague gives a good account of this fundamental theme in Aristotle; Aristote, 345-7. In the case of physical changes "une forme c?de la place ? une autre forme qui la chasse de la mati?re qu'elle occupait aupara vant. . . . L'?me ne devient pas chaude, elle devient la chaleur?laquelle n'a rien de chaud" (347). On matter and privation, the best reading remains Physics 1.7-9.189b30-192b4. The reality of privation, or lack (orepfjOLc), is brought out forcefully many times in these pages, for example 190al7-18: the subject of becoming subsists (vnopeuei), but the privation does not. "There is always both a persisting subject and a non-persisting contrary"; Irwin, Aristotle's First Principles, 85. 56 This connotation is sometimes preserved in French at least, in speak ing of a "polished" work, for instance: "Nous confondons ? tort finitude et imperfection. Le langage pourtant nous ?claire. Ce qui est fini est achev?, donc parfait"; Jacques de Bourbon Busset, La force des jours (Paris: Galli mard, 1981), 33. Cf. Aristotle, EN 2.6.1106b9-ll: "It is customary to say of well-executed works that nothing can be added to them or taken away, the implication being that excess or deficiency alike destroy perfection, while the mean preserves it." 57 See Physics 3.6.207al5-32; cf. Parmenides, DK 28B8.42-4, 32-3: "Therefore it is right that what is should not be imperfect; for it is not defi cient"; G. S. Kirk, J. E. Raven, M. Schofield, The Presocratic Philosophers, 2d ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 252. The passage cited by Owens (Metaphysics 986b 18-21) in support of his statement "an imma terial form is regarded by Aristotle as something finite, not infinite" concerns Parmenides and Melissus and repeats the same teaching as in the Physics</page><page sequence="28">498 THOMAS DE KONINCK infinite turns out to be the contrary of what it is said to be. It is not what has nothing outside it that is infinite, but what always has some thing outside it" (Physics 3.6.207a33-b2). In this sense of the word, then, "infinite" means deprived, wanting, in potency?the opposite of the perfection that defines actuality as such. Thus something is infinite if, taking it quantity by quantity, we can always take something outside. On the other hand, what has nothing outside it is complete and whole. For thus we define the whole?that from which nothing is wanting, as a whole man or a box. What is true of each particular is true of the whole properly speaking?the whole is that of which nothing is outside. On the other hand that from which something is absent and outside, however small that may be, is not "all." (207a7-12) "Infinite" may of course in another, extended, sense also be used to describe perfection?in Greek as in English. We have just seen Aristotle speak of the "infinite power" of primary substance, pure ac tuality. In this case the suggestion becomes again one of inclusion, not of exclusion. In point of fact forms extend to many: universals obviously do, to a potential infinity of individuals. Matter, on the con trary, is possessive, admitting of only one form at a time?hence there is change and its successive contrary determinations, or forms, as when your hand freezes in the cold and needs warmth again. Every relatively "perfect" physical object one may imagine?this knife as knives go, or this race horse, or this great work of art?all possess matter and to that extent will have the properties?the lesser or greater imperfections, exclusions, vulnerabilities to change, and so forth?that all material things possess, whatever their relative perfec tion. To claim that perfection excludes is hence to attribute to form the properties of the matter in which it finds itself. Imagination must be transcended for full perfection to be conceived. May not one object, "actuality separates" (r? y?p euTeXex^ta Xvpi?et; Metaphysics 7.13.1039a7)? This would be much more to the point, and brings us a little nearer to the main question that was raised passage just quoted. The lines from the Physics are, however, more explicit and show that neTrepaop?uou, "finite," means for Aristotle the opposite of what Owens takes him to mean. Cf. notes 53 to 56 above and the references and quotes from the Physics in our main text.

One substance cannot be made up of several actual substances (1039a3-4). Democritus rightly says that "one thing cannot be made out of two nor two out of one" (1039a9 10). Substance number two is a new form, undividedly one, provided of course that the two units which make it up are two only potentially. Two actually existing things never do make one actual thing, though one thing may be potentially two, as this continuum which I now divide into two halves. To be actually one something can be multiple only virtually: actuality separates in that sense (cf. 1039a4-14). If you claim?Aristotle, we saw, repeatedly does?that in the ac tivity of knowing the intellect and the "intelligible," or "object of thought," are actually one, surely you cannot mean that the intellect is simultaneously identical to several actual objects of thought? Or can you? Did we not just quote Aristotle to the effect that one thing cannot be at the same time many, save virtually, potentially? On the same account, no intellect?so the objection would run?could be iraura r? buTa, "all things," or "beings," or simply "forms." Surely not actually all, at any rate. Did we not observe that "actuality sep arates"? This much at least can be seen at once: You can only divide what was previously one; prior to separating one thing from another in your mind, you must have them both together somehow. Here again it leaps to the eye that inclusion is prior to division or exclusion.58 But how is this? V To try to solve this much more genuine aporia and others like it, one must look more closely into uotjolc. Aristotle wrote an entire, 58 On another level, mutatis mutandis, this was of course Hegel's main argument against Kant on another famous issue, namely, the possibility of metaphysics. See, for example, G. W. F. Hegel, Enzyklop?die der philoso phischen Wissenschaften im Grundrisse (1830), ed. Friedrich Nicolin und Otto P?ggeler (Hamburg: Felix Mainer, 1969), pt. 1, Wissenschaft der Logik, par. 60, pp. 83-4. Hegel points out that a limit can only be known to one who is at the same time beyond it ("dar?ber hinaus"). Only unconsciousness ("Bewusstlosigkeit") can therefore explain the failure to see that to declare something finite or limited ("Endlichen oder Beschr?nkten") contains the proof of the actual presence of the infinite, of the unlimited; for knowledge of a limit can only take place on the condition that "the unlimited is on this side of conscience" ("das Wissen vom Grenze nur sein kann, insofern das Unbegrenzte diesseits im Bewusstsein ist"). Unawareness of their limits is a characteristic of natural things like stones and not of living things who, as soon as awareness begins to emerge, experience pain and so forth.</page><page sequence="30">500 THOMAS DE KONINCK marvellously lucid?though difficult?chapter on u?tjolc, De Anima 3.6.59 The least one can do, on the subject of ubrjot? uoi]oeu;?, is to consider it. It emerges from that chapter that u?tjolc, thinking, is always about indivisibles. But indivisibles are of three kinds. The first kind offers the beginning of an answer to the question just raised. Take a continuum: this length, or line, or this given time. Thought in its unity, it is indivisible; it is actually so, and it must remain so. Nothing is easier than to show, however?as Zeno did?that the continuum con tains an infinity of parts. Divide the line AB at C into two halves AC and CB. Each of these halves in turn is divisible into two halves, and so on. You quickly see that you have here, in some sense, innumer able halves. If you actually divide it into halves, however, "neither the distance nor the motion will be continuous" (Physics 8.8.263a26 7). In other words, those innumerable halves are there "not actually but potentially" (a28-9), or else you have in fact two lines?and soon countless ones. "For though it is an accidental characteristic of the distance to be an infinite number of half-distances, it is different in essence [ovoia] and being [to eluat]" (263b7-9). To quote DA 3.6, "these do not exist, except potentially, if the whole is not divided" (430bl 1). To consider the parts of a continuum in succession?there fore in time (cf. 430bl2)?is one thing; it is quite another to grasp its actual unity (or indivisibility). The latter is instantaneous and does not, therefore, take place in time. "Since the undivided is twofold, either potentially or actually, nothing prevents one thinking of the un divided when one thinks of a length (for this is actually undivided), 59 To this must be added Metaphysics 6.4, 7.17, and especially 9.10, on thought of the simple. "Un des probl?mes les plus difficiles de l'aristot?lisme est celui de la pens?e (no?sis), divine et humaine, et quant ? son contenu et quant ? son mode d'exercice"; Goldschmidt, Temps tragique, 413. Cf. Enrico Berti, "The Intellection of Indivisibles According to Aristotle," in Aristotle on Mind and the Senses: Proceedings of the Seventh Symposium Aristotelicum, ?d. G. E. R. Lloyd and G. E. L. Owen (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), 141-63; Pierre Aubenque, "La pens?e du simple dans la M?taphysique (Z 17 et 9 10)," in EMA, 69-80; Thomas De Koninck, "La no?sis et l'indivisible selon Aristote," in La naissance de la raison en Gr?ce: Actes du Congr?s de Nice Mai 1987, ?d. Jean-Fran?ois Matt?i (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1990), 215-28. The great Greek commentaries, as well as those by R. D. Hicks and G. Rodier, are very helpful on this difficult chapter. Thomas Aquinas proves fully deserving of Martha Nussbaum's recent praise of his commentary as "one of the very greatest commentaries on the work"; see In Aristotelis librum de Anima commentarium 3, lect. 11, esp. nn. 755-9, ed. M. Pirotta (Turin: Marietti, 1948).</page><page sequence="31">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 501 and that in an undivided time; for the time is divided and undivided in a similar way to the length" (430b6-10). How is one to understand this indivisible or undivided time in which we are said to think the indivisible? Returning to our contin uum, it is clear that point C in our example is used to differentiate the halves; it is both the end of one and the beginning of the other. It is twofold, because we use it twice in that case; yet it may serve as well to unify the two halves into one continuum, in which case the duality has again become virtual only. The same applies to the instant (or "now"; to uvu), the indivisible of time according to the celebrated analysis of books 4, 6, and 8 of the Physics. "So the 'now' also is in one way a potential dividing of time, in another the termination of both parts and their unity. And the dividing and the uniting are the same thing and in the same reference, but in their essence [eiuat] they are not the same" (Physics 4.13.222al7-20). In other words, if we think one and then the other half of the line separately, we divide it and actually split it in two in our minds, simultaneously dividing time as we do so (btatpel Kai tou xpbuou apta; DA 430M2). If, on the contrary, we think this length in its unity?composed though it is of two virtual lengths?then we simultaneously think it in what unifies both parts of time, the now. Hence DA 430bl0-14: "It is not possible to say what one was thinking of in each half time; for these do not exist, except potentially, if the whole is not divided. But if one thinks of each of the halves separately, then one divides the time also simul taneously; and then it is as if they were lengths themselves. But if one thinks of the whole as made up of both halves, then one does so in the time made up of both halves." That is the most easily understood form of indivisibility, furnish ing only the beginning of an answer to our question. Clearly, when our human minds think the line, they cannot simultaneously be all its parts in actuality, any more than the line itself can.60 Although slightly 60 Cf. Metaphysics 9.6.1048a30-5: "Actuality, then, is the existence of a thing not in the way which we express by 'potentially'; we say that potentially, for instance, a statue of Hermes is in the block of wood and the half-line is in the whole, because it might be separated out, and we call even the man who is not studying a man of science, if he is capable of studying; the thing that stands in contrast to each of these exists actually." See also 1048bl4 17: "But the infinite does not exist potentially in the sense that it will ever actually have separate existence; it exists potentially only for knowledge. For the fact that the process of dividing never comes to an end ensures that this activity exists potentially, but not that the infinite exists separately."</page><page sequence="32">502 THOMAS DE KONINCK more difficult to grasp, the second type of indivisibility takes us much farther. Aristotle writes, "That which is undivided not as to quantity but in its form [elbet] is thought in an undivided time and with an undivided part of the soul" (430bl4-15).61 This doubtless refers to the well-known definition of "one" through indivisibility, the first two meanings of which are precisely the continuum and the form (or the whole).62 The following remark by Aristotle is helpful here: "While in a sense we call anything one if it is a quantity and continuous, in a sense we do not unless it is a whole, i.e. unless it has unity of form; e.g. if we saw the parts of a shoe put together anyhow we should not call them one all the same (unless because of their continuity); we do this only if they are put together so as to be a shoe and to have already a certain single form. This is why the circle is of all lines most truly one, because it is whole and complete" (Metaphysics 5.6.1016bl 1-17). Let us now consider the thought not of a continuum but of an elephant, say. The number, the diversity, the nature of its different parts is plain, but even plainer?and a greater source of wonder?is their unity, revealed in the question "What is an elephant?" (Or to quote the untranslatable and constantly recurring Aristotelian formula literally: "what it was to be an elephant" [to t? r)u eluat; quod quid erat esse], for which a poor substitute is "essence" or "form.") In the case of a continuum, parts and whole are all alike, homogeneous, and differing only in quantity. In contrast the parts of an elephant are heterogeneous indeed?the trunk, the feet and so on?and quite dif ferent in turn from the whole which nevertheless turns them into something one and without which they would not be the same (a sev ered foot is no longer a foot). When you consider them one by one in succession, you evidently think them in time, so that the case of the elephant is no different in this regard from the previous one of the 61 The transposition of this sentence after pfjKet at 430b20 (into 20a and 20b) proposed by Bywater and retained by Ross does not fit in with kolu TovToi? (bl7), as Willy Theiler points out; Aristoteles, ?ber die Seele, trans. Willy The?er (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1959), 145. The justification offered by Ross is that the sentence in question "seriously interrupts the discussion of quantitative abiaipera, which would otherwise be continuous from b6 to b20"; Ross, De Anima, 300; cf. p. 6. This assumes?wrongly, I submit?that bl6-20 concern only the quantitative abia?pera. 62 See, for example, Metaphysics 5.6.1016M-3: "In general those things the thought of whose essence is indivisible, and cannot separate them either in time or in place or in definition, are most of all one, and of these especially those which are substances"; and, most importantly, 10.1.1052al5-bl.</page><page sequence="33">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 503 continuum. What is new, and remarkable, is that each of those parts does possess a distinct to t? tju eiuat: the "what it is" of a trunk is quite different from that of an ivory tooth, and so on. Having actually divided the elephant in your mind, you find parts that each have in turn an indivisible form indivisibly grasped by the intellect. How can one reconcile this with the indivisible grasp of the indivisible form "elephant" in an indivisible time? Hence the admittedly difficult sentence which follows: "It is in cidentally, and not in the same way as those [the continua], that the act and the time in which these are thought are divisible; but [then they are thought] qua indivisible" (430bl6-17; my translation). The ?XX' i] abtaipeTa ("but qua indivisible") which, against all manuscript evidence, Torstrik wanted to remove, is essential to the meaning here if I understand it correctly. To think each of the parts in succession is no problem, since this is done in time. But if it is indeed the case that one thinks both the indivisible whole and its?no less indivisi ble?heterogeneous parts in one and the same instant and by a single indivisible act of the soul (as the previous sentence suggests), it can only be so incidentally?/cara ovpt?e?riKbc (bl6). In other words, what it is to be an elephant or a man is never as such divisible, even though, of course, this elephant obviously is divisible into both het erogeneous and homogeneous parts, and even though even its defini tion is divisible. Divisible and indivisible invariably pair together here again?thus the name and the indivisible u?rjpta, the voice and the concept. I am borrowing an example from Themistius, who marvels in his commentary to the De Anima that "we hear in time, whereas we do not think in time but in the now."63 In that sense, adds Them istius, the concept is divisible only incidentally, "not in itself" (ovx r? avT?).64 The same would apply to the eidos of elephant: it is only incidentally divisible in your mind, just as the line previously discussed is only incidentally divisible. The line's "essence" (ovoia) and "ex istence" (to eiuat) was said to be "other" (eTepa) than "an infinity of half-distances"?making its divisibility likewise an incidental charac teristic (cf. Physics 8.8.263b6-9 already quoted). Again we must note 63 Themistii in Libros Aristotelis De Anima Paraphrasis, ed. R. Heinze, (Berlin, 1899), in CAG, vol. 5, pt. 3, p. 110.22-3. 64 Ibid., 110.28-9; cf. 1. 27: "The name [buopa] is divisible, but the con cept [ubrjpa] is indivisible."</page><page sequence="34">504 THOMAS DE KONINCK an important proviso: unlike the parts of a line the parts of the elephant are heterogeneous and therefore possess their own indivisibility. Therefore, when I consider such parts in their division, succes sively, I evidently think them in time. The indivisible grasp of the indivisible form "elephant" in an indivisible time no more precludes virtual divisibility than did the previous case of indivisibility?just as when you form a proposition in your mind you think subject and pred icate together, and when you meditate upon a difference or similarity between several things you think simultaneously of these several things. Yet again here, as in the previous case, your mind cannot in the same indivisible instant be simultaneously in actuality all the het erogeneous and homogeneous parts of the elephant. Hence there is an inevitable putting together, the synthesis which makes one liable to error (cf. DA 430b 1-2) and makes discourse necessary. Still that undivided form, "elephant," does contain virtually all that can be said of it: propositions, differences, similarities and the like. To sum up: in every case considered so far one finds an indivisible, unifying, form. The eidos "elephant"?or indeed the eibo? "length" or "time"?is comparable in this regard to the point and to the "now," insofar as these give time and length their "unity," as we saw (cf. 430M8-9), without, however, being "separate" from them (cf. bl8: ccXX' loue; ov x^ptoTou). We see an actual whole, a finished form? perfect in the sense recalled earlier?enabling us to define the imper fect, the inexhaustible virtual, the infinite in that sense. Aristotle's analysis of indivisibility in relation to uotjol? culmi nates at 430b20-6. The question is now, How does one think what is totally indivisible? His meaning is made unequivocal at the outset, with the example of the point (430b20-1) described in the Metaphys ics (5.6.1016b24-6) as "absolutely" (or "wholly": -Kauri]) indivisible, like the unit (jiou??, 1016b25); both are instances of "that which is indivisible in quantity" (1016b24).65 The unity?or indivisibility?of substance is even greater: "In general those things the thought [uotjolc] 65 See further Hermann Bonitz, Index Aristotelicus (1870; reprint, Darm stadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1960), s.v. oTtypfj.

Totally indivisible means not even potentially divisible. What hap pens when we think such entities? Can mind reach them? Except for the word "point" (ortypif]) and so on, is there an eibo? of point? some indivisible form or determination thanks to which it can be thought?as in the case of the line or of the elephant? The text begins as follows: "The point and every division, and that which is in this way undivided, are made known as privation is [brjXovTai ucnxep rj oTeprjOi?]" (430b20-1). Both the universal "every division" (-ir?oa btaipeot?), and the addition "that which is in this way undivided," are important: the point itself serves to divide a line, while the "now" separates past from future.66 Every division is effected by means of an indivisible. It is explained, furthermore, in Topics 6.6.143b33-5, that it is sometimes necessary for the definer to employ a negation when defining, for example, privations. "For a thing is blind which cannot see when its nature is to see."67 To define the point one is forced into a simple denial of all divisibility: "that which has no part." As Sir Thomas Heath explains, Definitions should, in the first place, be in terms of things absolutely prior, or prior in the order of thought, to the things defined. There being nothing in geometry prior in the absolute sense to a point, a point must be defined, if at all, either by means of a posterior term or by negation. The first method is illustrated by the definition of a point as an extremity of a line, the second by Euclid's definition of a point as "that which has no part." The latter definition or its equivalent appears frequently in Aristotle. . . . The difficulty in Euclid's definition is the very one pointed out by Aristotle in [Topics] 142b25; the words "that which" in "that which has no part" almost invite the question, what is it that you mean by "that"?68 66 R. D. Hicks is very helpful on much of this; see Aristotle De Anima, trans. R. D. Hicks (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1907; reprint, Ansterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert, 1965), 522. See also Sir Thomas Heath, Math ematics in Aristotle (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1949), 193-4. 67 Trans. W. A. Pickard-Cambridge, in Barnes, ROT, vol. 1. 68 Heath, Mathematics in Aristotle 88-9. Heath observes, to begin with, that "the difficulties connected with the definitions of the most elementary things in geometry, the point and the line, could hardly be more lucidly put than they are in the long passages just quoted [Topics 6.6.143bll-144a4]" (p. 88; cf. 89-91). On ancient and modern attempts to define the point, and on Aristotle's view, see Heath's further explanations in The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements, translated with introduction and commentary by Sir Thomas L. Heath (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; reprint, New York, Dover Publications, 1956), 1:155-8.</page><page sequence="36">506 THOMAS DE KONINCK Such questions are partly met in the following lines of our text: "And the same account applies to the other cases, e.g. how one recog nizes evil or black; for one recognizes them in a way by their opposites" (430b21-3). The eibo?, as it were, of the point is its contrary (euauT?y; b23). It is constant in Aristotle that "even contraries have in a sense the same form [eibo?]; for the substance of a privation [oTepr/oeuc ovoia] is the opposite substance, e.g. health is the sub stance of disease (for disease is the absence of health); and health is the formula [Xbyo?] in the soul or the knowledge [eiuoTT)pLr)] of it" (Met aphysics 6.7.1032b2-6)?having specified, "by form [eibo?] I mean the essence [to t? r\u eiuat] and its primary substance [irp?jTr]u ovo?au]" (bl-2).69 Sickness or evil no more possesses a form thanks to which one could think them directly than does the absolutely indivisible. In De Anima (1.5.41 la3-7) Aristotle gives another clear example: "One element in each pair of contraries will suffice to enable it [the soul] to discern both that element itself and its contrary. By means of the straight line we know both itself and the curved?the carpenter's rule enables us to test both?but what is curved does not enable us to dis tinguish either itself or the straight."70 Most importantly, we see in Metaphysics 10.3.1054a26-9 the same rule apply to the one: "And the one derives its name and its explanation from its contrary, the indivis ible from the divisible, because plurality and the divisible is more per ceptible than the indivisible, so that in definition plurality is prior to the indivisible, because of the conditions of perception." It is clear, then, that for Aristotle the priority of the divisible over the indivisible is not one of nature but of knowledge. Other wise, he could not hold as he does that the one is prior to the many. This offers the beginning of an answer, at least, to the question posed by Thomas Heath concerning the priority of "point"?whose definition (ov pt?po? ovOeu) turns out to be indeed the very first one in Euclid's "Elements."71 No doubt it does enjoy some sort of pri 69 On form, form in the soul, and ovoia in this text, see Michael Frede and G?nther Patzig, Aristoteles Metaphysik Z', Text, ?bersetzung und Kom mentar (M?nchen, Verlag C.

The natural way, once again, is to "start from the things which are more knowable and clear to us and proceed towards those which are clearer and more knowable by nature" (Physics 1.1.184al6-18).72 Be that as it may, it is plain from the preceding that what is wholly indivisible is no more knowable directly to us than a negative contrary is. The negation by means of which you may reach it presupposes that its opposite is already known to you, hence already in your mind somehow. This is precisely what the subsequent lines of our text in De Anima say, adding that such a knower must therefore be in po tency: "that which recognizes must be its object potentially, and one [of the contraries] must be in it" (430b23-4, altering Hamlyn).73 Then, by contrast, the next sentence evokes divine knowledge: "But if there is anything, [one of the causes,] which has no contrary, then this knows itself, it is actuality and separate" (b24-26, altering Hamlyn).74 Suppose, per impossibile, I could not find in my mind a contrary thanks to which I could grasp the nature of evil, illness and the like; suppose I would not depend on some divisible, or sensible, reality to deny in order to say, or to think, the indivisible: how could I do it? More profoundly, how could one know an absolute individual (from the Latin, individuus, indivisible) which would be infinitely more than a geometrical entity?a nonsensible substance, for instance? In that case, the present text seems to say, there is no other possibility but that of knowing oneself first. The eibo?, or form, is no longer one with regard to which I am in potency, dependent. I am actuality 72 See also Metaphysics 7.3.1029b3-5; and Posterior Analytics 1.3.72b26-30: r? peu npo? f]pa? r? 6' airXCuc. The latter passage concerns induction, which goes from the first to the second. 731 have preferred the reading eu eiuat eu a-ury ("and one [of the con traries] must be in it") at b24, to eueiuat eu avT??j ("and [the contrary] must be in it"), because it has the advantage, pointed out to me by Jacques Brun schwig, of indicating a subject: eu ("one"). But these options make very little difference to the main meaning; the word eu ("in") recurs in each one. 74 Reading with Ross: ei be Ttut prjb?u ear tu euaurtbu [tlju air'tuu], avTO eavrb ytu?oKet Kai eu?pyet? kort Kai x^P^otou. Removing, like Zeller, tuju airiuu, or replacing it with tlju outuju (Torstrik), makes no dif ference to the main point.

Neither discourse nor ne gations are necessary. The absolutely indivisible is directly available to me: indeed it is myself! According to Willy Theiler, agreeing here with most commentators, "the substance that has no opposite, knows itself and is pure activity, is the divine Spirit."75 It cannot admit any contraries since the most obvious property of contraries is to exclude. Accordingly Metaphysics 12.10.1075b21-4 says (twice) that "what is primary has no contrary." "For all contraries have matter, and things that have matter exist only potentially" (b22-3). VI To conclude, then: In answer to our query regarding simultaneous knowledge of many forms we have now seen that, for Aristotle, so far as we humans are concerned, one may speak of the three types of virtual knowledge of many realities in one indivisible form just de scribed. A fourth has been hinted at by contrast; it is obviously not for us to experience this, since we are not separate substances. Sup pose, however, the existence of such a substance, and especially the first substance of chapters 7 and 9: a perfect thinking substance, pure activity forever indivisibly aware of its thinking, both itself the most intelligible and the most desirable Being. Clearly then all that is actual has to be actually in that form of forms.76 The opposite view forces one into the impossible position of trying to reintroduce potency into Aristotle's account, which carefully excludes it in every way it can, as we saw. Since, however, the potential is known through the actual, 75 "Die Wesenheit, die kein Gegenteil neben sich hat, sich selbst erkennt und reine T?tigkeit ist, ist der g?ttliche Geist; Met.

The perfect, we recalled, is that which lacks nothing. It can be shown that Plotinus's critique of Aristotle "rests on a false presentation of uorjot? uor)oeu?" as Horst Seidl says and shows very well.77 The excellence of Plotinus's objections quoted at the be ginning of this paper is sufficient proof already that he was, as much as Aristotle, seeking for absolute simplicity or indivisibility in God. As I have tried to argue elsewhere, the views of both on this are much closer in effect than they appear to be.78 All suspicion of duality in the ubrjot? uofjoeu? is completely removed by Aristotle's treatment of it in Metaphysics 12. This absolute unity and indivisibility of God's thought brings out particularly well both the absence of any potency in him, to be sure, but also his immediate actual knowledge of all things. Jonathan Lear has seen this with great clarity, as I indicated earlier. But he has also made the most interesting following point. The idea, perpetuated by Richard Rorty's book Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, that before Kant philosophers have held a mirror theory of the mind does not prove altogether true; for Aristotle, at least, objects ultimately conform to God or Active Mind: Both Aristotle and Kant believe that objects must conform to knowledge rather than vice versa But for Kant this implies that the conforming objects of knowledge must be "appearances": empirical knowledge is possible only if it is partially but significantly constituted by a contri bution of the human mind. Thus it is very much our knowledge to which objects must conform. . . . For Aristotle, by contrast, objects must conform to our knowledge not because they must conform to the human mind, but because they must conform to God or Active Mind. Aristotle is thus, one might say, an objective idealist. He is an idealist in the sense that the order of the physical world is ultimately dependent 77 See Horst Seidl, in AWW, 2:157-76; I quote from p. 171. The influence of Aristotle on Plotinus is a commonplace since Porphyry (Life of Plotinus 14.4-7). But it appears just as evident that he depended on commentators, chiefly Alexander of Aphrodisias, and probably?for the question that con cerns us?on the Liber Mantissa.

Yet there is no trace of subjectivity in his idealism. Objects must conform to knowledge, but that does not reveal them to be con stituted by any contribution from us. Aristotle and Kant differ not over whether objects must conform to mind, but over the location of the mind to which they are conforming. Since, for Aristotle, there is nothing distinctively human about the mind to which objects are conforming, there is no basis for saying that the essences we contemplate are mere appearances.79 It should be clear that to skip over, as is usually done, the passage on the ovoToixia of opposites quoted earlier, is a mistake (its impor tance did not, we observed, escape Hegel).80 The statement ?pxv y?p f] uorjoL? ("for the thinking is the starting point"; 1072a30), now takes on an even fuller significance. As Gauthier and Jolif rightly emphasize, God is even "l'intelligible au supr?me degr?, le premier intelligible, et c'est en tant que supr?me intelligible que l'atteint la con templation: Aristote sur ce point n'a jamais vari?."81 Now that su premely intelligible Being is shown in that passage to be not only the first principle of all intelligibility but also of all real goodness, more rigorously translated the statement says that thinking is the principle of all intelligibility and hence of true Good. Does it follow that God would have to know relations and oppo sites as we do? It does not, since, as DA 3.6 also shows clearly, this again would introduce potency in him. The point is, rather, the es sential law they illustrate: the imperfect is invariably known through the perfect?which in no way entails that this always takes place ac cording to the same mode or by means of discourse. We just read DA 79 Lear, Aristotle, 307-8; cf. pp. 306-9; and, on indivisibility, pp. 303-6. 80 See, however, the difference between Hegel and Aristotle detected by Gadamer, who at the same time recognizes the importance of the lines in De Anima which we have just examined: "Ein besonders aufschlussreichender Text, an dem sich diese Differenz zeigen laesst, ist De anima III 6, 430 b 20 ff"; Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Hegel und die antike Dialektik," in Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hegels Dialektik (T?bingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1971); 27. Unduly in fluenced by Torstrik, Ross dismisses the same lines as "a series of jottings"; Ross, De Anima, 300. Brentano observes rightly that "wer die Form erkennt, zugleich die Privation"; Brentano, Die Psychologie des Aristoteles, 191. He refers, however, to Topics 1.14.105b31 alone, without establishing the link with the ovoTotxia of opposites in Metaphysics 12. 81 R. A. Gauthier and J. Y. Jolif, L'Ethique ? Nicomaque, Commentaire, vol. 2 (Louvain, 1970), 858. They bring together Metaphysics 1072a26-7, EN 10.7.1177a20-l, and Protrepticus 14W. They add: "ce qui est en soi le su pr?me intelligible est pour nous ce qu'? y a de plus difficile ? saisir par l'in telligence," reminding us that the latter is comparable to the eyes of bats in the blaze of day; Metaphysics 2.1.993b9-ll.</page><page sequence="41">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 511 430b24-6 hinting at a different mode. Should pure actuality be known directly, no potency under any guise would be left, no discourse even from one contrary to another; self and other would be known at once in one same indivisible now.82 Otherwise that first immediate knowledge would be in potency again, hence no different from ours. As for potency, it is knowable through actuality alone. Seeing itself, that substance would have to see the other forms, less perfect than it is; it would hence see imperfection, as wakefulness makes one aware of sleep (the reverse not being true). We cannot ourselves picture this at all, and must have constant recourse to opposites and negations to say or to think what this might be like (as I have just revealed again!). It does not follow, if Aristotle is right, that every form of thinking must do the same, especially if it is pure light and pure intel ligibility. This reading of Aristotle on God's knowledge has the advantage of support from the great classical commentators or interpreters of his works, as well as from contemporary scholars and philosophers such as those already mentioned. Themistius writes, "The First In tellect intellects, in intellecting His own Self, all the intellecta to gether. ... It has become evident from all this that God is the First apxi), and that He intellects together His own Self and all the things of which He is the ?pxv- In possessing His own Self, He also pos sesses all things, whose substance is due to Him. . . . Now the First Intellect intellects the world. . . . From His own Self He intellects that He is the cause and the ?pxv of all things."83 Avicenna: "One of the things that Themistius did well was to show clearly that the First apxf) intellects his own Self, and then from His own Self He intellects all things" (p. 191); "Because of His intellecting His own Self and (His intellecting) that He is the apxfj of all things, He intellects from His own Self all things" (p. 194). Although critical of Themistius, Averroes writes: "He knows the existents through (knowing) the Existence which is the cause of their existences" (p. 195). Maimonides: "Through knowing the true reality of His own immutable Essence, He 82 "Nicht: dum deus calcul?t fit mundus; aber: deus numquam desinit intellegere omnia intellegibilia simul"; Gadamer to Oehler, in Oehler, Unbe wegte Beweger, 120. "At divinus intellectus, propterea quod summe est per fectus, dum intellegit, tempus non requirit, sed simul omnia subito intellegit"; Themistius, CAG, vol. 5, pt. 4, p. 32.23-5. 83 Trans. Salomo Pines, in his "Metaphysical Conceptions," 185. Par enthetical page references in this paragraph and the next are to this article.</page><page sequence="42">512 THOMAS DE KONINCK also knows the totality of what necessarily derives from His acts" (p. 198); One statement among many by Thomas Aquinas shows his full accord with all such statements: "Cum enim ipse sit ipsum suum in telligere, ipsum autem est dignissimum et potentissimum, necesse est quod suum intelligere sit perfectissimum: perfectissime ergo intelligit seipsum. Quanto autem aliquod principium perfectius intelligitur, tanto magis intelligitur in eo effectus; eius nam principia continentur in virtute principii. Cum igitur a primp principio, quod est Deus, de pendeat caelum et tota natura, ut dictum est, patet, quod Deus cogno scendo se ipsum omnia cognoscat."84 The traditional line taken to explain God's perfect knowledge of the world according to Aristotle is indeed that of his causality, as is apparent in several of the above quotes already. Even Averroes had no problem seeing that God could be "the Form, the Efficient (Cause) and the TeXo?" (see p. 196). For Themistius, "if in intellecting his own Self He intellects that He is what He is, He intellects (in intellecting) His own Self the cause and the ?pxv of all things. ^Apxv may be said of the form, as well as of the final cause and of the ?pxv of motion" (p. 186; cf. p. 188). Maimonides insists that God "is the efficient cause, that He is the form and that He is the end. Thus it is for this reason that they say that He, may He be exalted, is a cause and a ground, in order to comprise these three causes?that is the fact that God is the efficient cause of the world, its form and its end" (pp. 198-9). And although he puts it differently, Avicenna expresses the fundamental argument very well: "For if He intellects His own Self (together with) everything that belongs to it, He (must) (also) intellect that which is attached to it in actu. Accordingly he would intellect its being the ?pxv and [this must entail?] His intellecting all [things]. For other wise He would not intellect His own Self in its entirety" (p. 192). There is no evidence in Aristotle's works that any of these inter pretations are false?quite the contrary. Form, mover and that for the sake of which "often coincide" (epxtrat be Ta Tp?? ei? eu 7ro\X.?/c?c; Physics 2.7.198a24-5). A good instance is the soul: it is "the cause and principle [airia Kai ?pxr)] of the living body. But these are spoken of in many ways, and similarly the soul is cause in the three ways distinguished; for the soul is cause as being that from which the movement is itself derived, as that for the sake of which it 84 In Metaph. 12, lect. 11, n. 2615; quoted in Pines, "Metaphysical Con ceptions," 201.</page><page sequence="43">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 513 occurs, and as the essence of bodies which are ensouled" (DA 2.4.415b8-12). We have sufficiently elaborated above on God as ac tuality or form, and we have quoted Aristotle to the effect that God is also the first Good, the "final cause" of everything there is. The Met aphysics is less concerned with God as efficient cause, although even there it is often emphasized, as I have tried to indicate elsewhere and as others have also shown.85 Other treatises, those that have to do with motion, focus more largely on efficient causality, for instance Physics 7.2.243a32-4: "the prime mover [to be ixpCorou kluovu], taken not as that for the sake of which [to ov eueKeu] but as the source of the motion [bOeu rj apxr\ rffc Kturjoeu?] is simultaneous [apta] with the thing moved." "The primary source of the change or the staying un changed" (bOeu rj ?pxf] Tf)? pteTa?oXfjc [or Ktuf]oeu;?] r] npc?Tr] r? tt]? rjpepirjoeLu?) is of course the "efficient cause," whereas to ov eueKa, "that for the sake of which," is usually translated as "final cause."86 Both expressions, as well as references to form, are frequently applied by Aristotle to God?this creates problems only if one expects one form of causality to exclude another, or if one confuses "creation" and "efficient cause."87 Finally there are the other moving causes: what ever one may think of Metaphysics 12.8 and its theory of intermediate unmoved movers, it does bring out Aristotle's concern to establish more clearly the relation of this most real Being?God?and the world.88 85 See my "Pens?e de la pens?e" (pp. 99-106) for references to Aristotle and to modern commentators. There are a wealth of excellent references and arguments in the article by Verdenius cited in note 13 above. 86 See, for instance, Physics 2.3.194b29-30; Metaphysics 5.2.1013a29 30; literally "whence comes the origin of the change," as suggested by Richard Sorabji in his Necessity, Cause and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory (London: Duckworth, 1980), 40; see also pp. 41-4, 51-6 for Aristotle on the efficient cause. "Staying unchanged" may with advantage be substituted to the more usual "rest," to translate ripepfjoevc, as in William Charlton's trans lation which I quote here; Aristotle's Physics I, II (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970). Examples adduced include the author of a decision, the father of the child, or generally speaking the maker of the thing made and what produces change of the changing; cf. Physics 2.3.194b30-2; 195a21-3; Metaphysics 5.2.1013a30-2; 1013b23-5). 87 On this see my "Pens?e de la pens?e," 97-9. For an excellent con temporary discussion of God as formal, efficient, and final cause in Aristotle see Klaus Brinkmann, Aristo?es' allgemeine und spezielle Metaphysik (Ber lin: Walter de Gruyter, 1979), 182-8. 88 See especially Philip Merlan, "Aristotle's Unmoved Movers," Traditio 4 (1946): 1-30; and W. K. C. Guthrie's summary in his History, 267-76. The most important contribution on this question, since Merlan's, has been that</page><page sequence="44">514 THOMAS DE KONINCK Two points of method may be added. Aristotle says clearly (Physics 2.7.198a27-31) that the study of unmoved causes of move ment belongs to another branch of study (npayptaTeia). In the De Generation et Corruption (1.7.324bl3-5) he writes "the active power [to ttoltjtlk?u] is a cause in the sense of that from which the process originates [bOeu rj ?pxv rfj? Ktufjoeuc?that is, the "efficient cause"]; but the end, for the sake of which it takes place, is not active [to b' ov eueKa ov noLrjTtK?u]. (That is why health is not active, except metaphorically)."89 If Aristotle is given the credit of meaning what he says, it follows that to speak in Metaphysics 12 of a "motion" of the end sensu stricto would have meant speaking metaphorically. The concern for God as moving cause proper seems to belong in his eyes to natural science (in his large sense of that term), whereas Meta physics 12.6-10 focuses more on God as separate substance and as end of all things. We saw that for Aristotle, perfection implies activity, the greater as the perfection is greater. Nofjoeuj? uorjot? is through and through perfect thinking of the first substance?simple, immutable, eternal? by itself. We saw too that perfection is defined by Aristotle as "that from which nothing is wanting." Exercising those three forms of cau sality of all there is, this thinking of thinking must necessarily know the totality of its power, down to its ultimate effects.90 But if it was of H. J. Kr?mer in the several works and articles mentioned in note 4 above. Kr?mer has very effectively shown how much of what he calls a "theological Realphilosophie" one finds in Aristotle, as should be clear even from what little we have been able to say in this paper on God as ixpC?Tj] ovo?a, for instance, pure act, prototype of the ?tbc OeujpeTtKb?, and so on (cf. Kr?mer, Grundfragen, 378-9). The main weakness of Oel?er's theory is his reduc tion of Aristotle's God to a logical relation of sorts. This kind of attempt has been effectively refuted by Jacques Brunschwig in "Le Dieu d'Aristote au tribunal de la logique," m L'Age de la science 3.4 (1970): 323-43. For a more sympathetic account of Oehler see Franco Volpi, La d?termination aristo t?licienne, 381, 386-7. On the unmoved movers, see also my "Pens?e de la pens?e," 122-6; on Oehler and Kr?mer see pp. 133-5. 89 Trans. H. H. Joachim, in Barnes, ROT, vol. 1. To do justice to this theme one would need to go into the analysis of becomings in Metaphysics 7.7; notably on the sense according to which "health comes from health" (cf. 1032b6-ll; and the commentary by Michael Frede and G?nther Patzig). As to method and order, see again Charles Kahn's remarks in his "Intended In terpretation" (note 18 above). 90 Cf. Themistius, in CAG, vol. 5, pt. 4, p. 33.23-6: "quid impedimento erit intellectui, quominus ex se ipso agat atque intellegat? ex his igitur per spicuum fit deum esse primum principium seque intellegere et omnia simul, quorum ipse principium est."</page><page sequence="45">ARISTOTLE ON GOD 515 important to specify in which several ways that thinking is first, the chief one remains: God is "first object of desire" (1072a28), the Beau tiful itself, moving all things Cj? ep?pteuou. To be complete, our ac count would need to take into careful consideration chapter 10, which deals with this and is the chapter on which book 12 closes.
