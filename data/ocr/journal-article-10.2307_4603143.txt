After locating three minimally literate peasant family lineages in Lijiayang and Linfengkeng villages, Shouning County, Fujian Province, China, not applying science-based systems of agroforest management, a decision-tree model of an indigenous agroforest management system was constructed fiom extensive interviews. The system was centered around shamu (Cunninghamia lanceolata), an important timber species with a long history of management in China. A major part of the management system is agricultural intercropping with a wide variety of cereal, cash, medicinal, and oil-producing crops. Intercropping is practiced in the initial phases of afforestation; is an integral aspect of site preparation and the tending of the young stand; and contributes to tree establishment, growth, and survival. The cases presented demonstrate that local peasant knowledge of the effects of buming, site preparation, crop selection, crop tending, and intercropping duration on soil quality and the survival and development of shamu is strongly analogous to the knowledge derived through systematic scientific research. This process of deriving scientifically valid ecological knowledge through traditional means is called proto-science.

The object of the research was to compare the knowledge underlying the peasants' process of agroforest decision-making to systematically de- rived scientific knowledge in order to obtain an estimate of the validity of traditionally derived knowledge of ecological processes. As an exercise in ethnoscience, the work was guided by the hypothesis that peasants, if given long experience in manipulating their local ecosystem, can derive an un- derstanding of ecological processes that is analogous to the understanding derived through the systematic application of the scientific method. Else- where this process of deriving scientifically valid knowledge through tradi- tional means (nonliterate or minimally literate and lacking formal methodology) has been labeled "proto-science" (Chandler, 1990). It should be emphasized that what has been studied is not shamu, its associated in- tercrops, the biological interactions associated with shamu or its intercrops, nor the resources employed in their management, but the knowledge and utilization of knowledge about these resources held and transmitted by peasant agriculturalists. Underlying all ethnoscientific study is the concept that knowledge and culture are carried by language. Underlying this particular study is the no- tion that people learn by and from experience. Central to the ethnoscien- tific approach is the distinction between "emic" and "etic" description (Pike, 1954). Emic description of a given culture's behavioral system is a description presented in the culture's own terms. It utilizes the locally rec- ognized features, the locally employed contrasts between features, and the local terminology to identify "not only the structural units but also the structural classes to which they belong" (French, 1963, p. 398). Most work undertaken from the ethnoscientific approach has con- cerned the classification and organization of natural or man-made phenom- ena and has commonly resulted in the generation of so-called folk taxonomies. In a somewhat more recent development, the ethnoscientific approach has been taken beyond classification and organization to provide revealing analyses of decision-making processes in relation to economic al- ternatives and natural resource management (Quinn, 1978; Gladwin, 1979). In these studies an emic analysis has made it possible to describe some aspect of a given culture in a systematic and replicable manner. This analy- sis "should ultimately indicate which etic characters are locally significant [and useful for a] reduction of the significant attributes of the local clas- sifications in culture-free terms" (Sturtevant, 1964).</page><page sequence="3">Agroforestry in China 417 These "culture-free," or etic, terms are actually the terms or units em- ployed in systematic scientific investigation. For example, the emic folk tax- onomies elicited by an ethnobotanist are compared to and contrasted with the etic taxonomies derived through systematic botany. Such systematically derived points and frames of reference serve as an "etic grid" (Hunn, 1975) upon which the emic description may be plotted. It is this feature of the ethnoscientific approach that provides the opportunity for replication and permits a structured comparison of the resource management practices of nonscientific people-such as peasants in isolated mountain villages in Fu- jian Province-with the practices suggested by systematic research into questions of scientific silviculture. This somewhat novel ethnoecological approach to resource manage- ment research was drawn primarily from the work of Gladwin (1979, 1983) studying the decision-making processes of Mexican peasants in order to facilitate and implement rural development schemes advocated from out- side the local natural and social environment. Such a practical application of ethnoscience may evaluate the accuracy of the ecological knowledge al- ready possessed by local peasants. This should permit those people con- cerned with a community's development to maximize the practical utility of their efforts by an awareness of what is valuable and worth maintaining within the peasants' traditional resource management experience and-to paraphrase an American idiom-to avoid fixing what is not broken. In fact, Gladwin demonstrated that local knowledge of local agricultural con- straints, understandably, can be more accurate and complete than that of scientific agronomists working from generalized models. As will be shown here, long experience of working within a local ecosystem can be adaptive; that is, the reasoning behind the Chinese peasant's practices of intercrop- ping shamu is generally sound and based on an accurate understanding of the ecological processes at work on the lands he tills. The only exception to this finding fits within the theoretical framework discussed earlier in this journal by McGovern et al. (1988). This framework specifies a set of "information flow pathologies" that confront groups who are newcomers to an ecosystem. In this research, one lineage of peasants with no more than eight generations of continuous experience with the shamu jianzhong engaged in agrosilvicultural practices that, in the long term, should result in a failure to provide sustainable production of both food crops as well as timber. By contrast, another lineage with about 30 generations of such experience had evolved a slightly different system that has compensated for the threats to sustainability. These peasants, especially those who are descendants of the earliest settlers of the mountain valleys where the research was conducted, can pro- vide explanations of ecological processes that approximate the explanations</page><page sequence="4">418 Chandler of modern science, but with one crucial difference. This difference, reflect- ing the emic-etic distinction basic to ethnoscience, lies in the means of ex- plaining causality. As Feit (1973) and Jones and Konner (1976) have observed, traditional explanations do not necessarily employ the units, terms, or mechanistic "how" forms of modem science, nor even necessarily recognize or employ such constructs as "ecosystems" or "ecological proc- esses." Instead, these traditional explanations of ecological processes tend to be expressed in personal or moral terms and tend to employ moral, dynamic, teleological, or anthropomorphic "why" forms of explanation. RESEARCH METHOD The methodology for this research was developed from the work of Spradley (1979, 1980), Biernacki and Waldorf (1981), Gladwin (1983, 1989), and Weller and Romney (1988). The primary method was the structured eth- nographic interview, with the interviews being undertaken in three basic groups. The objective of the first group of interviews was to obtain a listing and description of the resources available to the study population and their goals for those resources along with a listing of which peasants among the study population practiced the shamu jianzhong in the same way. More sim- ply, this first set of interviews sought to answer the questions "What?" and "Who?" The second set of interviews tried to answer the questions "How?," "When?," and "Where?," that is, the objective was to elicit from the study population a step-by-step detailed account of the resource management prac- tices actually employed. The objective of the third group of interviews was to identify the constraints, in particular the ecological constraints, impacting upon the decisions taken in the process of planning and realizing the study population's resource management practices. These interviews, by asking the question "Why?," provided the data needed to test the research hypothesis. Through the first two sets of interviews it was possible to generate a taxonomic decision-tree model (see Gladwin, 1989, for a discussion of this process) of the study population's entire agroforest resource management process. Due to time constraints, however, effort was limited to those as- pects centered around shamu and, to a lesser extent, wenmu (Cryptomeria fortunei Hooibrenk ex Otto et Dietrich). Such a decision-tree model graphi- cally depicts the course of each peasant's decision-making process (see Fig. 1). Decision-trees of this form can be generated for each peasant in- terviewed; however, it is more informative if such trees are constructed cumulatively to represent the decision-making of a super-typical peasant within the study population as a whole or within specific groups such as, in this case, distinct family lineages.</page><page sequence="5">Agroforestry in China 419 RETURN routines Do broadleafs or shamu dominate the stand? shamu broadleafs / Is this third shamu crop?

After testing the model for accuracy, these reasons, be they of an ecological, legal, social, or other nature, can then be compared where possible to the available scientific literature to assess the degree of simi- larity or dissimilarity and thereby test the research hypothesis. It is in this phase of the research that the distinction between the peas- ants' emic description and the scientist's etic description, not to mention the researcher's ability to understand and interpret his subject population's local expressions, become critical. In some cases this is easy. For example, if the question, "Why does manuring your intercrop of maize help the shamu cuttings you have planted?" brings forth the peasant's answer, "Be- cause they can both eat from the same bowl," then it should be obvious that the fertilizer applied to the maize can also be taken up by the shamu. In some cases that are not so obvious, additional questions must be posed. Usually these additional questions take the form of asking the peasant what conditions must be changed or provided so that his goal in making a given decision can be attained. For example, the question, "Why is a first-year intercrop of maize good for the shamu cuttings you have planted?" may prompt the peasant to point to his 2-year-old granddaughter and say, "If this child's mother were to die tonight, she may continue to grow, but she will not be as happy and healthy as the child whose mother has not died." In this case, the researcher is clearly in need of additional information. THE RESEARCH CONTEXT A General History of the Shamu Jianzhong Shamu has been the single most important timber species in China for as long as written records of forestry exist in that country. According to Xia (1979), the world's earliest known timber scaling system, the Longquan Majie, was developed by a father-and-daughter team early in China's Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD). Shamu features a rapid growth rate, good form, beautiful and workable wood, and, as a member of the Taxodiaceae, exceptional durability. Importantly for the most common form of regeneration, shamu sprouts vigorously from dormant root collar buds after felling. The species is common throughout the highlands of southern China and has enjoyed active cultivation by peasant farmers in those areas for no less than 1000 years (Zhao, 1980) and perhaps as many as 2000 years (Lan, 1987). In fact, without cultivation shamu is such a poor com- petitor in its early stages of growth that stands of natural origin are quite</page><page sequence="7">Agroforestry in China 421 rare in China today (Huo, 1975). For at least five centuries an integral part of the traditional system of cultivation of shamu has been the intercropping of edible, medicinal, economic, and oil-producing crops (see Yu and Sun, 1984, for a discussion of the origins of intercropping with shamu). The long-term objective of the traditional shamu intercropping system from the point of view of the landowner has been to establish a thriving plantation of shamu, while the short-term objective from the peasant's point of view has been to provide food and other products for himself and his family. Over the course of the rotation the forest restores many of the soil properties needed for agricultural production, which in turn provides the site preparation and protective cover needed to establish the shamu plan- tation. With proper attention to rotation length, stand composition, and soil conservation, the system is both ecologically sustainable and economi- cally beneficial to China's rural communities (Chandler, 1994). As with the precise time, the specific reasons for the origin of shamu intercropping are not known with certainty. Yang et al. (1979) cite the in- creasing population of China, widespread rural poverty, and feudal land- holding patterns as giving rise to the intercropping system. In order to provide themselves with subsistence, peasants would make contracts with large landowners that permitted them to plant the hillsides and mountain basins to agricultural crops for periods ranging from 1 to 9 years in ex- change for planting and tending widely spaced plantations of shamu. In this system, "the short cycle supported the long cycle and the long cycle was integrated with the short cycle" (Lan, 1987, p. 20). The traditional system of shamu intercropping has taken a number of forms. Yu and Sun (1984) have discussed the system from several aspects. Yang et al. (1979) and Huo (1975), as well as Yu and Sun, cite the simul- taneous planting of shamu with the cultivation of any of the agricultural crops listed in Table I as the most common as well as most ecologically sound form of intercropping. Lan (1987, pp. 20-21) has provided a concise general description: * Fell all plants in the forest and brushland, then burn and spade the site. * Plant shamu cuttings at a density of about 900 to 1500 stems per hectare (60 to 100 stems per mu). * Interplant with annual crops and tung-oil. * During the cycle harvest annual crops in the first three or four years, collect tung-oil seeds from the fourth to seventh years, fell the tung-oil trees in the eighth or ninth year, then 10 years later harvest the shamu, commonly without performing any intermediate</page><page sequence="8">422 Chandler Table I: Shamu Intercropse Staples Wheat (Tniticum aestivum) Buckwheat (Fagopyrum sp.)

This form of intercropping provides the most intensive tending for the young stand, minimizes soil and water loss, provides shamu with the pro- tective cover it needs for establishment on and occupation of the site, and, if the intercrops are selected wisely, minimizes the crops' consumption of soil nutrients the shamu needs for growth. In this form the high-stemmed crops are usually employed in the first year and the low-stemmed crops in the succeeding 2 or 3 years. Yu (1988, personal communication) says that intercropping has been practiced wherever traditional forms of shamu cultivation have occurred in China, regardless of the local methods of regeneration. The traditional method of regeneration most commonly uses root collar sprouts as planting stock. Other methods are both clonal (coppice sprouting, sprout layering, and branch cuttings) and sexual (wildlings and seedlings). At the site of the research reported here, shamu regeneration was almost exclusively de- pendent upon cuttings derived from root collar sprouts, the use of which was reflected in the methods of intercropping practiced. The Research Site For this research the traditional system of shamu agroforest manage- ment was studied in Lijiayang and Linfengkeng villages. These are isolated rural hamlets located in Kengdi District at the extreme northern tip of Shouning County in Fujian Province. Lijiayang lies about 2 km south of the crest of the Tonggong Shan at an elevation of 952 meters. Linfengkeng is about 1 km closer to the crest at an elevation of 1010 meters. Underlying soils are humultic ultisols (yellow red earths) that in some scattered areas are deficient in phosphorus and potassium, but throughout contain ade- quate amounts of nitrogen and organic matter for the growth of shamu. Soil pH values range from about 4.5 to 5.3, which are slightly more acidic than is preferred by shamu. Climate data collected for Kengdi, 7 km to the southwest and 96 meters lower in elevation than Lijiayang, show a mean annual temperature of 14.5 C, a mean temperature in the coldest month (January) of 4.2 C, a mean temperature in the warmest month (July) of 24.3 C, an active growing season of 222 days (defined as the number of days with a temperature of 10 C or greater), and a mean annual precipi- tation of 1929 mm that is distributed adequately throughout the active growing season in all months except October. Lijiayang and Linfengkeng are considered to lie in an area of potential winter ice and summer hail</page><page sequence="10">424 Chandler hazard to crops and trees (all climate data from Shouning County, 1980). According to the environmental parameters outlined by Yu (1983), Lijiay- ang and Linfengkeng are locales well-suited for the growth of shamu in all aspects except those relating to temperature, which in both villages falls slightly below ideal conditions. A detailed breakdown of the agricultural and forested land in Lijiayang and Linfengkeng is presented in Table II. As of October, 1988, the total population of Lijiayang was 357 persons (204 males, 153 females) in 89 households in two main family lineages. The larger, the Wu lineage, consisted of 72 households and has resided continuously in the village for, depending on the household, 29 to 32 gen- Table II.

During this period, as these statistics reveal, very few productive activities were permitted to interfere with the process of "making revolution."</page><page sequence="11">Agroforestry in China 425 erations, or more than 750 years. Prior to their migration to Lijiayang, the Wu lineage had two sojourns of about 200 years each in the shamu culti- vation areas of Shaoxing and Longquan, Zhejiang Province, the latter the same area where the Longquan Majie was developed some centuries later (Wu Family History Committee, 1984). The smaller lineage, the Ye, consisted of 13 households and had re- sided continuously in the village for more than five generations, or more than 125 years, after a sojourn of seven generations in Xipu, a village in the Xixi District of Shouning County, about 22 km southeast of Lijiayang at an elevation of about 450 meters. This lineage originally was from Zhuyong County, about 55 km from Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, an area where shamu has no recorded history of cultivation (Ye, n.d.). From a re- view of the Ye Family History (Ye, n.d.) and the interviews conducted with members of both the Ye and Wu lineages, it appears that the Ye lineage enjoyed a relatively greater wealth than the Wu, at least until the advent of the Land Reform that followed the Communists' assumption of govern- ment in 1949. Their history documents a succession of landlords since their arrival in Lijiayang and suggests a slightly higher average per capita own- ership of both agricultural and forested land than the Wu, although it was not possible to compare the productive quality of the land held by the two lineages. Also, as detailed below, prior to the Communists the Ye were the only family to have been able to educate more than one member of their lineage per generation. In addition to these two main lineages, three more households of the Chen lineage have two generations now living in the village. Also, the Yuan lineage is represented by a single older, unmarried male who is the adoptive son of a Wu family. The Wu, Ye, Chen, and Yuan are all lineages of the Han, the ethnic majority of China. Two more ethnic Han households of the Lan family lineage live in Linfengkeng. The other 18 households in this village belong to the Lei fam- ily lineage, a part of the Shezu ethnic minority, which itself is a subgroup of the Yao minority. Together these lineages give the village a total popu- lation of 108 persons (47 males, 61 females). Although the Lei either did not maintain or, more likely, would not share their family history, it is clear from the information presented in Table II that prior to Land Reform they enjoyed access to a smaller per capita forested and agricultural land base than the people of Lijiayang. The Lei have lived in Linfengkeng for nine generations, or about 225 years. This lineage is originally from Leishan, a small mountain village about 550 kms to the southeast in Guangdong Province. One member of this lineage, a former soldier mustered out of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) after the Vietnam War (1979), has visited the ancestral home where</page><page sequence="12">426 Chandler he spent most of 1981. According to his account, Leishan lies at about the same or a slightly lower elevation than Linfengkeng. Both crops and trees grow better in that wetter, warmer climate. He further claims that the Lei of Leishan have "planted shamu forever," an understandable exaggeration in light of the long association of shamu with the Yao and other minority nationalities of southern China (Averill, 1983; Menzies, 1988a). The vil- lage's Party Secretary estimated the lineage's tenure in Leishan at about 400 years, an estimate conforming to literature on the history of minority ethnic groups in southern China (Jeffrey et al., 1980; Fairbank and Reis- chauer, 1989). Within this population, Mr. Chen Changfa, Lijiayang's Party Secretary, estimates that about 125 to 150 males are available for forestry related work, but the demands of the two villages' intensive agriculture make their availability seasonal and, in general, the labor supply for forestry today is considered rather limited. The great differences of experience with the shamu jianzhong and ten- ure in Lijiayang between the Wu and Ye lineages provided an opportunity to observe the degree to which time contributes to the accumulation of scientifically valid ecological knowledge. According to the work of McGov- ern et al. (1988), the Ye should suffer relative of poverty of scientifically valid knowledge as their experience with shamu has been subject to a "short observational series." This poverty should take the forms of the "false anal- ogy" and "insufficient detail" described by McGovern et al. As has been discussed elsewhere (Chandler, 1990, 1994), this poverty of knowledge only appeared in the considerations of the long-term ecological sustainability of the system. Interview Sample A randomly selected 25% sample of the heads of households was used to complete the first-phase interviews. To elicit the decision-tree model of traditional shamu management and intercropping, a total of 13 heads of households (7 Wu, 3 Ye, 3 Lei) were selected following iterative techniques described by Biernacki and Waldorf (1981). This model was then tested for reliability through interviews with four additional heads of households (2 Wu, 1 Ye, 1 Lei) and modified accordingly. Following this modification and retesting, from the 17 heads of households used for model-building and reliability testing, seven (3 Wu, 2 Ye, 2 Lei) were selected for the hypothesis testing interviews. These seven people were selected on the basis of having provided relatively greater depth and breadth of detail in their responses to the second-phase interview.</page><page sequence="13">Agroforestry in China 427 The first-phase interviewees' ages ranged from 24 to 86 years, with their mean and median ages being 57 and 54 years, respectively. The in- terviewee ages for the subsequent interviews ranged from 41 to 70 years, with both mean and median ages being 56 years. The hypothesis testing interviewees of the Ye lineage were brothers and had enjoyed some edu- cation with Daoist masters in various subjects, including literacy, calligra- phy, and geomancy (fengshui). None of the hypothesis testing interviewees among the Wu had enjoyed any education beyond the 6-month rural liter- acy campaigns sponsored by the Communist Party in the 1950s and 1960s and were no more closely related than a common ancestor three genera- tions removed. The two Lei interviewees shared a common ancestor two generations removed, and one, the PLA veteran, had the equivalent of a high school education. Potential interviewees who had worked in govern- ment forest farms were excluded from all interview samples (This criterion eliminated two potential interviewees and, according to Mr. Chen, these two men were the only two in the village with such experience). In summary, while traditional Chinese culture cannot be generally de- scribed as either preliterate or nonscientific, in the study villages no evi- dence could be found to suggest that, prior to the Communists, anyone in the interview samples other than the two Ye brothers had enjoyed any form of education that conferred upon them the benefits of literacy, much less of training in the formalities of the scientific method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A simplified decision-tree model of the intercropping portion of the Wu lineage's shamu management system is presented schematically in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the peasants of Lijiayang have employed one crop, turnip (Brassica sp.), not mentioned in any of the literature surveyed. All but the youngest interviewee provided a description of the procedures of intercropping turnips. Of all the agricultural intercrops mentioned in the literature, only five were cited as intercrops by the peasants of Lijiayang (see Table I). Tung-oil intercropping, while often mentioned in the litera- ture, was described by only the interviewees of the Ye lineage. Many of the advantages and disadvantages of intercropping shamu documented in the literature are recognized and understood by the peas- ants of Lijiayang. Among the economic benefits they described are in- creased supplies of food, edible oils, and green manures; more efficient use of land and labor resources; increased afforestation activity; and supe- rior tree growth. Among the ecological advantages of intercropping the peasants cited were those related to site burning, site preparation, crop</page><page sequence="14">428 Chandler tending, fertilization and manuring, and improved tree survival and growth. Many cases were found where the underlying ecological reasoning de- scribed as responsible for these advantages might be compared to the sci- entific literature published and available in the People's Republic of China. It was these cases that were used to test the research hypothesis. Burning the Mountain The peasants of Lijiayang referred to site burning as huo shan, or "burning the mountain." The benefits cited included clearing the land of competing vegetation, increased soil permeability ("The soil can drink more water"), and the value of the resulting ash as a fertilizer for both trees and crops. Several peasants further claimed that the trees grew better in the past when broadcast burning was permitted than they do today when planted according to government guidelines that exclude fire and limit site preparation to small 1-meter blocks immediately surrounding each planted cutting. The available literature supports all these views. Huo (1975) and Zhang (1985) have documented the effects of burning on the physical properties of the soils used for shamu afforestation. Burning increases the total porosity of these soils, mostly due to an increase in non- capillary porosity. The quantity of water-stable soil aggregates is reduced by the fire's consumption of the organic matter that cements these aggre- gates and particle size is reduced. A certain amount and intensity of rainfall is beneficial for water infiltration into the soil, but beyond this the disper- sion of smaller soil particles and fine ash easily plugs the soil pores and brings about an internal collapse of the soil structure. Then, once the soil is saturated, surface runoff increases and soil erosion and water loss are aggravated. These problems make site burning appear irrational, but as Lan (1987) noted, "for the peasants at present there is no substitute," or as the peasants themselves say, "Huo bu shang shan, buneng cha shan"; that is, if no fire on the mountain, shamu cannot be planted (Sheng, 1984). Aware of this erosion potential, the Lijiayang peasants usually begin tilling and sowing or planting their crops as soon as the land has cooled after burning so that the site is reoccupied by vegetation as quickly as possible. The changes in physical character and the high temperatures of burn- ing also bring about changes in the soil's chemical character. Burning re- duces the humus content of the soil-25% in the A and B layers, according to Zhu (1978). According to Huo (1975), Zhang (1985), and Lan (1987), high temperature volatilization reduces the total nitrogen content in the soil, but available nitrogen is increased for 1 to 3 years. Zhu reports a</page><page sequence="15">Agroforestry in China 429 similar pattern for phosphorus and potassium. The greater porosity of the soil after burning increases aeration, which raises rates of nutrient oxidation and release. The increased soil pH values and increased nutrient availability resulting from burning can promote the development and activity of the soil microorganisms responsible for ammonification, nitrification, nitrogen fixation, and cellulose decomposition, so some of the nitrogen losses are recovered fairly soon, within 2 to 3 years after burning (Zhou et al., 1980). As the soils of Lijiayang tend to be slightly more acidic than is pre- ferred by shamu and as local nutrient deficiencies are limited to phosphorus and potassium (Shouning County, 1980, and personal measurement), the ash resulting from burning is certainly a beneficial input to the soil. Huo has also found that in the first year following the burning the growth of shamu cuttings is especially good and the survival rate of the cuttings is improved. Of all the practices associated with shamu intercropping, site burning requires the most care and timeliness if its benefits are to be realized and not overshadowed by the detriments of soil erosion and water loss. Yu (1983) has written that the ill effects of burning were less common in pre- 1949 China as the area of each afforestation planting was limited to the small parcels of land either belonging to a single landowner and his family or worked by a tenant and also because the planting took place amid an indigenous broadleaf forest whose undercover vegetation could arrest ero- sion, but because of the large scale of the areas cleared and burned, af- forestation efforts made after 1949 on large parcels of communal land resulted in "great losses" of soil and soil fertility. The peasants of Lijiayang acknowledged the possibility of detrimental effects from site burning and explained measures needed to minimize them. After burning they know the site must be occupied as soon as possible by crops to reduce erosion and water runoff. They also know that measures must be taken to keep the fire as cool as possible in order to leave un- consumed the types of woody material that act as barriers to water flow and erosion. To this end they normally burn only on overcast days, prefer- ring days following a rain, or in the cool, dewy early morning hours. While the peasants are aware that too hot a fire will "burn the fertilizer," they nonetheless practice summer burning whenever they plant a crop of turnips, justifying this practice by explaining that turnips can only be planted in July. Echoing Yu (1983), the peasants also claim that in the past site burn- ing created few problems of erosion and water loss because the scale of their affortestation efforts, "only a few mu" (15 mu = 1 ha), left the plant- ing sites surrounded by a mature forest that arrested such erosion and water loss problems as did take place.</page><page sequence="16">430 Chandler Site Preparation The site preparation benefits cited by peasants are also supported by the available literature. These benefits included loosening the soil and clearing it of the roots of competing vegetation through the processes of spading and turning the soil; however, these peasants caution that on the steeper slopes strips of soil spaced at regular contours must not be spaded so that soil erosion will be controlled. When asked whether complete spading of the site or spading in strips yielded superior growth of shamu, the peasants said that the two methods could not be compared as only the shallower valley basins are spaded completely and the soil of those sites is deeper, richer, and therefore better, so, of course, the trees grew better. Huo (1975) states that overall site tilling, either by spading or plow- ing, accelerates soil erosion and water loss, but yields about the same tree growth as tilling that is limited to strips separated by untilled soil. The method of site preparation in strips following the slope contours re- duces erosion to one-half or even one-quarter that brought about through overall tilling (Sheng, 1984). Still greater soil conservation is achieved when site preparation is limited to blocks immediately surrounding the spots to be planted to shamu; however, this method prevents or at least seriously reduces the opportunity for intercropping and also results in the poorest growth of the planted shamu cuttings. The method employed depends on the available labor supply in rural areas and on the degree of slope of the land to be planted. In any case, Yu (1983) has pointed out that plowing and spading benefit the growth of shamu by removing the roots of competing vegetation, improving soil structure, and increas- ing water retention when proper measures of soil conservation are also practiced. These same benefits are provided by the hoeing employed to tend the agricultural intercrops (Liu and Wei, 1985). Hoeing also encourages shamu to deepen and expand its roots system, which increases its number of water and nutrient absorbing contacts with the soil (Yu, 1983). The peasants ex- plain this by saying that hoeing "makes the shamu's roots more exerting" (shamu genzi bijiao nuli). In addition to these benefits, the peasants noted that their presence on the site to tend the crops also gave them the op- portunity to secure and straighten any shamu cuttings that might leaning improperly, inspect for and replace any mortality among the cuttings, and inspect for damage by insect or rodent pests.</page><page sequence="17">Agroforestry in China 431 Insect Pest Control As to insect pests, most peasants interviewed maintained that shamu did not suffer from any such problems in their village, but their behavior may in part explain why this is so. In moving about the village, the re- searcher occasionally discovered freshly cut shamu logs brought from the forests to the roadside. These logs had always been stripped of bark, al- though this was never the case with either wenmu (Cryptomeria fortunei) or Masson's pine (Pinus massoniana Lambert) logs similarly deposited after harvest. When questioned about this practice, the peasants of the Wu line- age explained that the bark was useful as roofing material, as had been observed with both shamu and wenmu. These peasants stated that if the bark were not removed from the shamu the only problem would be a waste of useful material; however, the peasants of the Ye lineage claimed an ad- ditional problem would occur. These peasants claimed that if bark were left on the shamu after harvest the logs would give rise to an insect that is harmful to the living trees, but stated that they did not know what form this harm would take. Although no specimens of either the insect or its damage could be found and collected, the Ye peasants' description of the insect ("liang ge changjiao, gen shiuniu yiyang de," or "two long horns, like a water buffalo") match those of a longhorned beetle (Semanotus bifasciatus) described by Yu (1983). Moreover, the control measures recommended by Yu, matching the tree to its best sites and removing the bark from newly felled trees, both of which were practiced by the Wu peasants, could in part explain the absence of knowledge among the Wu regarding of this insect pest in Lijiayang. As for the greater knowledge of this insect held by the Ye, their experience cultivating shamu at the much lower, less frost susceptible ele- vations of Xipu could have exposed their forests to greater numbers of beetles and them to more frequent contact with this particular insect pest. Intercropping With the exception of the youngest interviewee, all the peasants inter- viewed in the course of this research claimed that shamu grew better with an intercrop than without one. Some of them further claimed that the poor growth of the existing young stands in the village was due to the absence of an intercrop. To explain this, the peasants cited the application of com- post and green and livestock manures for the crops as also being beneficial for the shamu ("The trees can eat from the same bowl"). They also cited</page><page sequence="18">432 Chandler the turning of crop residues into the soil after harvest as helping the shamu by providing nutrients, organic matter, and increased water holding capac- ity. One explained that the presence of the crops themselves, not just their tending, made the trees "more exerting" (bijiao nuli). To this end, several peasants noted that it was best for the shamu if the last intercrop were soybeans or peanuts; however, some said that even 3 years of maize was better for the shamu than no intercrop at all. As one peasant put it, "When shamu is young, maize is its big brother." The presence of certain crops has in fact been shown by systematic research to improve the growth of shamu. Yu (1983) reported on a study by the Fujian Forest Science Research Institute in which young shamu with a 3-year intercrop of maize registered 33% greater height growth and 64% greater diameter growth than the control of young shamu without an in- tercrop. Feng et al. (1980) found similarly improved growth with an inter- crop of maize, but with an intercrop of hill rice (Oryza sativa var.), a crop not employed in Lijiayang or Linfengkeng, the 3-year height growth of shamu was 12% lower than the control. As for making the soil more ex- erting, Feng et al. found that with either intercrop the organic matter con- tent of the soil was increased and the cycling of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium was accelerated, both the result of the addition of crop residues to the soil after harvest. Feng et al. also found that an intercrop of maize increased the quantity, diversity, and biochemical activity of the microor- ganisms in the soil surrounding the roots of shamu, thus promoting the decomposition and transformation of organic matter in the soil and creating more advantageous conditions for the growth of the young stand. Zhou and Xu (1980) studied the microbiological properties of soil supporting shamu and intercrops of tung-oil, millet, soybean, buckwheat, sweet potato, and pepper, as well as maize. All the different intercrops offered some microbiological benefits, but maize, millet, and soybean, the sequence of intercrops most preferred in both Lijiayang and Linfengkeng, were found to be the most beneficial in promoting the growth and development of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms, nitrifying bacteria, and cellulose decompos- ing bacteria and increasing the intensity of their biological activity. Huo (1975) also studied several intercrops and found that shamu's height and diameter increment were greater with an intercrop of millet than of maize, but that maize, millet, soybean, peanut, and sesame all yielded greater growth than young shamu could achieve if planted without an intercrop. The only intercrop Huo found detrimental to shamu was sweet potato, a finding he attributed to sweet potato's dense, intertwining root system being in direct competition with the young trees' roots. In addition to below-ground effects, the above-ground morphology of the intercrop can also influence the growth of shamu. Although shamu is</page><page sequence="19">Agroforestry in China 433 a light-demanding species for most of its life cycle, in its initial 2-4 years of growth it requires partial shade, higher levels of relative humidity and soil moisture, and cannot tolerate high soil surface temperatures brought about by direct sunlight (China Woody Plant Flora Committee (CWPFC), 1981). Yu (1983) noted that high-stemmed intercrops, crops such as "big brother" maize, in the first year of tree growth and low-stemmed intercrops in the second and third years provide precisely those modifications to mi- croclimate that shamu needs to establish itself and occupy the growing site. Huo (1975), Sheng (1984), and Zhang (1985) all recommend that to pre- vent overconsumption of soil nutrients by the intercrops, intercropping, with the exception of tung-oil, not exceed the first 2 years of the forest plantation, but they all also acknowledge the enhanced tree growth result- ing from intercropping. On another aspect of intercropping, one group of peasants said that the wider spacing of an intercropped shamu plantation produced a greater volume of timber at the end of a rotation than the more densely spaced "government forest." Research results in China demonstrate that this is true. The spacings recommended by the peasants in the study villages result in plantation densities ranging from 1200 to 2250 stems per hectare, some- what greater than the densities Lan (1987) cites as common in traditional shamu cultivation systems. These peasants all were in agreement that the poorer sites should be planted at higher densities and the better sites at lower densities, a practice scientifically trained foresters worldwide employ to make best use of more productive forest soils. In their study of affor- estation densities, Ruan and Dou (1981) found that on mid-class sites a density of 1830 stems/ha maximized total timber volume when the rotation included no intermediate cuttings. In their work with stand control dia- grams, Liu and Tong (1980) provided data indicating that on better class sites shamu stands that undergo no intermediate cuttings maximum total volumes are attained at densities between 1000 and 1500 stems/ha. When asked about the possibility of thinning shamu stands at intermediate ages, the Wu peasants answered, "We have no time for that," or, "Shamu does not need that." The peasants acknowledge no more than the possibility of disadvan- tages from a shamu intercropping system. These are the possibilities of soil erosion and water loss resulting from burning and excess tilling and nutrient consumption by the intercrops; however, these peasants are aware of the measures necessary to minimize these possibilites. As for nutrient consump- tion, these peasants say that either millet or maize may be intercropped with shamu for the first 3 years of the rotation, but the use of millet should be limited to two crops and maize to one or these crops will consume nu- trients shamu needs for growth, or as one peasant said, "They will eat the</page><page sequence="20">434 Chandler shamu's food." Recognizing this possibility, the peasants note that it is best for the growth of the shamu if the final intercrop is soybean or peanut. Most of the peasants interviewed also admit that a crop of turnips on the site prior to planting the shamu cuttings lowers the soil nutrient levels, but justify this practice by observing that "turnip is good to eat." The oldest peasant interviewed offerred a different explanation. He said that in the past turnips were planted only if a sufficient number of shamu sprouts were not yet available for use as planting stock; that is, turnips would be planted only if more time were needed for the harvested shamu's stumps to produce root collar sprouts and the land would otherwise be idle. Attempts to cor- roborate this claim often brought a response indicative of the value of ex- perience in traditional forms of transmitting proto-scientifically derived knowledge: "Perhaps it is true. He is much older than we." Planting Stock Another aspect of the traditional forest intercropping system addressed concerns the use of root collar sprout cuttings as planting stock rather than the seedlings the Kengdi Forest Farm could and offers to make available. In 1965 the peasants rejected an effort to establish a shamu seedling nurs- ery in Lijiayang because, according to their accounts, the land it would have occupied was too valuable in use for food production. Moreover, di- rectly contradicting Fujian Province Forestry Ministry officials (Bao, 1988, personal communication) and the official view that "only seedling affores- tation can be recognized and accepted as a timber forest" (Feng et al., 1980), the peasants claimed that while cuttings need time to develop roots and so may grow more slowly in the early years of a rotation, they soon catch up and surpass the growth of trees originating from seedlings. This claim is supported by form factor and site index comparisons of shamu stands originating from cuttings and seedlings (Lin, 1979; Lin et al., 1984) as well as other studies (Feng et al., 1980; Huang, 1982). In addition to the different processes of root growth, one peasant claimed that local shamu grew better if it originated from the local cuttings rather than seedlings offerred by the Kengdi Forest Farm because "every- one is happier closer to home." Conversely, he asserted that the Kengdi seedlings would do better if they were planted in Kengdi rather than in Lijiayang. In discussing their research, Feng et al. (1980) also note the ad- vantages of adaptation to the local climate offerred by locally derived cut- tings over seedlings of a different provenance. Beyond the advantages of superior growth, the peasants also claim that clonally regenerated stands suffer less midrotation mortality because "cut-</page><page sequence="21">Agroforestry in China 435 tings are all brothers [and] have no jealousy" (chatiao dou shi gedi, meiyou hongyuanbing), thereby yielding a greater volume of useful wood. This ab- sence of sibling rivalry was, upon further questioning, explained as a more uniform, less competitive utilization of "food" or soil nutrients. This expla- nation is also supported by research. Feng et al. (1980) and Huang (1982) both noted that a forest originating from cuttings is "tidier;" that is, it dis- plays less variation between trees than a forest originating from seedlings. This tidiness in a cutting stand was attributed to a more uniform genetic composition, the "brotherliness" of the traditional explanation, which re- sults in a more evenly balanced site utilization between trees and reduced midrotation mortality, or lessened problems with "jealousy." This case is particularly interesting because it documents how the peas- ants have taken their personal observations and a traditionally derived grasp of basic genetics and from them derived theories of intraspecific competition and adaptation to local ecosystems that are essentially sound. It is also in- teresting as an excellent example of the use of moral concepts-"brotherli- ness," "jealousy," and "happiness"-to explain ecological phenomena. Sustainability Earlier in this journal, Menzies (1988b) described the shamu jianzhong system of agricultural intercropping, comparing it to the British taungya system in Burma. He noted that "the feature that distinguishes [the shamu jianzhong] from swidden systems is that in the latter, the cultivated land is left fallow after several years of use, and natural secondary succession takes place; whereas the forest which is the result of [the shamu jianzhong] is a plantation of one or more deliberately chosen timber species" (362). Menzies then went on to observe that the Yao [minority] "leave some stand- ards through a second rotation to obtain large sawtimber for homebuilding. The Han, however, do not require large sawtimbers, so their plots are clear- cut at the end of every rotation, about every 30 years" (368). In either case, Menzies asserted that such repeated rotations of crops and shamu provide "continuous, sustained yields" (374). The long history of the shamu jianzhong recounted by Menzies (1985, 1988a,b) testifies to the system's sustainability, but his description omitted a significant feature of the shamu jianzhong, at least as it is practiced by the Wu lineage of Lijiayang, that lends the system not only its ecological sustainability but also its economic viability. This feature also constitutes one of the most remarkable findings of this research. While the Lei shared the Yao's habit of leaving standards from one rotation to the next, just as described by Menzies, (1988b) and the Ye prac-</page><page sequence="22">436 Chandler ticed the shamu jianzhong much as it is described by Yu and Sun (1984), Lan (1987), and Menzies, both lineages also often planted wenmu with the shamu at the beginning of each rotation. In the case of the Lei, they insisted that shamu should not be planted unless sufficient planting stock of wenmu was also available. This permitted an intermediate harvest of the faster growing wenmu and also had the effect of opening the stand canopy and encouraging the rapid growth of opportunistic species of the family Fagaceae awaiting just such a release from the understory. In the case of the Ye, they would interplant wenmu if stock were available, but claimed that such interplanting was not necessary (see Chandler, 1990). Although they claimed never to have interplanted wenmu or to have performed intermediate cuttings, the Wu lineage added one significant step to their decision process. This step follows every three rotations of the shamu jianzhong and, according to the Wu, would occur more frequently if they had access to a larger land base. After three rotations of crops and shamu, the Wu said it was necessary to abandon the site to the zamu (the "weed trees") and await some specific changes in the composition of the naturally succeeding forest. The changes involve the displacement of a few understory species indicative of poor growing conditions for shamu and the appearance of several more canopy and understory species indicative of better growing conditions (see Table III). This change in composition during the "natural secondary succession" Menzies (1988b) says is absent from the shamu jianzhong system indicates, according to the Wu, that the soil supporting the system has recovered from several adverse conditions caused by repeated, short rotations of shamu. The described conditions include acidic or "sour" (suan) soil, high levels of soil toxicity (duhua), and the presence of excessive "white fungus" (bai junzi) surrounding the roots of shamu grown on overworked sites. Not only will the trees suffer reduced rates of growth from this fungus' "poi- soning the shamu's food" (duhua shamu fan), but the agricultural intercrops also suffer poor growth and often "cannot be born from the soil" (cong tudi buneng sheng). The Wu said that both the cultivation of additional crops of peanuts or soybeans and the application of human and livestock manures could delay these problems, but not eliminate them. The only cer- tain solution was to abandon the site until the positive site indicators, in- cluding many broadleafs of the family Fagaceae, through natural processes returned to and dominated the site. Many of the same aspects of the Wus' account of an apparently wide- spread difficulty also appear in a study of shamu and soil toxicosis con- ducted by Zhang et al. (1980) at the Guangping Commune in Huitong, Hunan Province. Using soils from first, second, and third rotation stands of shamu as a growth medium, Zhang et al. found an increasing inhibiting</page><page sequence="23">Agroforestry in China 437 Table III Site Indicator Speciesa 1.

They attributed this effect in part to nutrient exhaustion on the more heavily used soils and in part to increased acidity, but even after adjusting all their soil samples to pH 7.2, the third- rotation soil was still the worst. This remaining effect they attributed to the accumulation of various soil toxins including iron and aluminum salts, oxidized vanillins and methoxyl polyphenols, and the toxic phytocides formed by various bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) and fungi (Actinomyces griseo, Fusarium spp., and Cladosporium spp.). To combat the effects of such soil toxicosis Zhang et al. provided four recommendations: improving soil ni-</page><page sequence="24">438 Chandler trogen supply, intercropping with leguminous green manures, interplanting with broadleaf species, and rotating crops of shamu with broadleaf species. Comparing the work of Zhang et al. (1980) to the three distinct systems of the shamu jianzhong indicates that the Wus' practice of employing a broadleaf fallow and the Leis' insistence upon practices of interplanting wenmu and carrying the shamu standards through long, widely spaced ro- tations insure the sustainability of these two systems. However, earlier work (Chandler, 1994) indicates that the Lei system, while ecologically sustain- able, produced a long-term economic return approximately two-thirds that of the Wu system. Also, the Leis' cultural requirement for large dimension timbers rules out the option of the Wus' shorter rotations and broadleaf fallows. Under these circumstances, the Lei have chosen to bear the cost of a lost economic opportunity. The Ye system, as long as sufficient interplantings of wenmu were in- cluded, was comparable to the Wu system in terms of both ecological sus- tainability and long-term economic return. However, if the Ye failed to include wenmu and the intermediate cuttings that opened to stand to the beneficial effects of broadleaf invasion, the work of Zhang et al. (1980) suggests that nutrient depletion and soil toxicosis would eventually threaten both the ecological sustainability and long-term economic return of the Ye system (see Chandler, 1994 for an extended and much more detailed dis- cussion of this entire case, including estimates of the relative economic re- turns of the three systems). This account of the need to rotate shamu with various broadleaf trees is probably the single most significant finding of the research. The Wus' explanation of the adverse biological processes at work in the soil support- ing successive crops of shamu was remarkably similar to the scientific ex- planations of those same processes provided by Zhang et al. (1980). Even the terminology used by the Wu bore a strong similarity to that used by Zhang et al. Perhaps more remarkable than the similarity of the Wus' account of soil toxicosis to the work of Zhang et al. was the dependence this bit of knowledge had on the ability of the Wu to communicate accurate infor- mation from one generation to another by word of mouth alone and to apply to that information the powers of logic and deduction. For the Wu, a single rotation of shamu requires about 35 years to attain a size suitable for their needs. Prior to 1949, the life expectancy for a Chinese peasant, even if he survived infancy, was less than 40 years (Fair- bank, 1957, p. 37). That being the case, it was rare that any peasant would have the opportunity to compare the growth rates of two successive rota- tions of shamu on a given site. However, a form of record keeping was available to supplement any oral accounts an illiterate peasant might re-</page><page sequence="25">Agroforestry in China 439 ceive. This form of record keeping was the house in which the peasant (and, in all likelihood, his father, grandfather, children, grandchildren, and perhaps still more generations) was born. Many of the peasants interviewed could recount where several of the larger beams, poles, and planks in their house had been grown and who had planted or harvested them, even if those persons had died long before. His own house then provided the peas- ant with a ready record for comparing growth rates on specific sites that have been used by his family since long before living memory. The Ye, by virtue of their much shorter experience with the shamu jianzhong and their somewhat longer rotations, sometimes ranging up to 65 years, would have access neither to the amount of knowledge accumu- lated over the Wus' more than 750 years of practice nor to the amount of tree-growth records available in the form of the Wus' ancient houses. These time factors mean that the Ye have barely had the necessary three rotations of shamu required to demonstrate soil toxicosis and nutrient depletion, much less the time needed to adapt their system to compensate for these threats to sustainability. This lack of knowledge is reflected in their poverty of familiarity with local site quality indicators (see Table III). What the Ye almost certainly have recognized is that, at least for the short-term, their economic returns compare well with those of the Wu and, as long as that is the case, it is an understandable bit of logic to view lands standing ap- parently idle in a broadleaf fallow for several decades as a waste of re- sources. Still, even if the peasant uses his house as a heuristic or mnemonic form of record keeping, this record will not tell him why shamu growth rates have or have not declined. To answer this sort of question the peasant has only his powers of observation, logic, and deduction to draw upon. In the case of the Wu, those powers have led to a valid understanding of sustainable ecological processes remarkably similar to that of scientists ad- dressing the same question. CONCLUSIONS This research had documented numerous cases where traditionally de- rived understandings of ecological processes are strongly analogous to the understandings derived through systematic application of formal scientific methods. These cases concern the benefits and best methods of site burn- ing, site preparation, agricultural intercropping, insect pest control, selec- tion of optimal stock for forest regeneration, and maintenance of long-term soil productivity.</page><page sequence="26">440 Chandler The knowledge represented by these understandings required centuries to accumulate. None of it was apparently acquired through literate means. Very little of it was acquired through direct teaching or instruction. Most of it was acquired through practical experience, either through observed example or through the opportunistic testing of working hypotheses. This latter experience is the most significant. It is the product of, first, an inti- mate familiarity with a specific local ecosystem derived from a succession of lifetimes spent manipulating that ecosystem to the advantage of the hu- man communities dependent upon it and, second, the ability to generate theories of ecological processes and turn those theories into testable hy- potheses. Their ability to amass scientifically valid knowledge about the ecosystems they inhabit is limited only by the amount of time they have had in those ecosystems and their lack of the technology needed to enhance their otherwise unaided senses. The knowledge held by people of traditional societies, even in an age of modern science, technology, industry, and mass communication, may be the only thing that saves them or the ecosystems they inhabit from degra- dation or destruction. Gladwin (1979) suggested as much in her study of the failure of the Plan Puebla. Her work revealed a pathology of "insuffi- cient detail" (McGovern et al., 1988, p. 245) modern scientists display when they do not take the trouble to collect data regarding the role of a com- monly overlooked component in most of the earth's ecosystems, the human component. The members of those traditional societies that still remain in the world have often inhabited their home environments for centuries, in some cases millenia. The knowledge gained from their experience has evolved in a specific local ecosystem. The capacity for this evolution prob- ably has a Darwinian basis. This research has demonstrated support for such a view by providing evidence of the ability of humans "to reason from visible effects to invisible causes and speculate about the intelligible order of nature as a whole" (Bloom, 1987, p. 270), and that the proto-scientific ability of humans is not dependent upon their training, occupation, or avo- cation as scientists, natural philosophers, or even literates, but only upon their dependence upon nature for their survival.
