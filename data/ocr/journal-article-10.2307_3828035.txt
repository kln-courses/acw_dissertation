To be "at supper" means to be eaten; as the king "goes a progress," he does not eat his subjects out of house and home, as when he was alive, but becomes himself the food of beggars. In his last published work, Charles Darwin also wrote about "a certain convocation of politic worms" whose activities made them participants in a wide range of cultural practices, from agriculture to Classical archaeology. Darwin, of course, differed from Hamlet in that he had no real interest in destabilizing his government. Nevertheless, from his earliest work on coral reefs to his last work on earthworms, Darwin's insistence on relating the material to the spiritual, and the natural to the cultural proved no less antagonistic to principal figures in the world of bourgeois high culture. Tracing the evolution of cultural concepts through language, Raymond Williams follows the development of the word "culture" from its first uses in connection with agriculture as "the culture of something" to the dominant mid-nineteenth-century use of "culture" as "a process of'inner' or 'spiritual' as distinct from 'external' development" (13-14). This shift is accompanied by a move away from a conception of culture as a materially productive interaction with nature to a conception of culture as separate both from material produc- tion and from biological/physical nature. Between his early work and his later work Darwin, too, moves from the notion of culture as agriculture to use of the SPRING 1992</page><page sequence="2">PUNCH'S FANCY PORTRAITS.-No. 54.

The version of culture he adopts, however, is never "distinct from 'exteral' development." For Darwin, the idea of culture is most useful precisely because it remains rooted both aesthetically and physically in nature. Darwin's last work, The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms with Observations on Their Habits (1881), is as much a book about agriculture and Classical culture as it is about invertebrate biology. Though many of the Romantic poets-as well as such parson-naturalists as Gilbert White-could make room in a single text for nature, agriculture, and aesthetic or intellectual culture, Darwin engages all three as active agents, productive of themselves and of each other, collaborators in the production of what would later be called their environment (see Moore for a discussion of the influence of the parson-naturalist tradition on Darwin's life and work). Darwin devotes a full chapter to "The Part which Worms Have Played in the Burial of Ancient Buildings," with diagrams and descriptions of Beaulieu Abbey, the Roman Villas at Chedworth, and other specific archaeological excavations. Archae- ologists, he tells us, "are probably not aware how much they owe to worms for the preservation of many ancient objects" which have been buried under layers of worm excrement (Formation 176). Worms have in effect joined the ranks of amateur Victorian collectors, preservers, and antiquarians, whose detailed obser- vations fueled the theories of the day's leading scientists. In that empirical age of collecting and preserving, the worms' slow, methodical work was exemplary. While the work of worms often results in objects valued by a specifically bourgeois aesthetic, it does so in some wonderfully subversive ways: When we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we should remember that its smoothness on which so much of its beauty depends is mainly due to all the inequalities having been slowly leveled by worms. It is a marvelous reflection that the whole of the superficial mould over any such expanse has passed, and will again pass, every few years through the bodies of worms. (Formation 313) Worms have often figured, as they do in Hamlet, as the natural levelers of inequality, only here the leveling process appears as productive of beauty and culture rather than as ugly and the harbinger of social chaos. Although the actions of the worms in this passage are not as explicitly political as those in Hamlet, the overall effect of the book on worms is nevertheless to threaten the status quo by linking physical and intellectual activities, effacing a distinction essential to much nineteenth-century cultural criticism. I There could hardly be two more elusive or protean concepts than those of "culture" and "nature." While the development of both concepts has been VICTORIAN STUDIES 296</page><page sequence="4">A CLERISY OF WORMS IN DARWIN'S INVERTED WORLD traced extensively, I would like to point here to a single split in the nature- culture relationship evident among those poets we have come to call the Ro- mantics. This is not a split between nature and culture, but rather a division of the two terms into four. An earlier use of the term "culture," as, for example, agriculture, implied a direct connection to nature in its fecund, physical aspect: human labor interacting with nature produces culture. As the term "culture" came to denote an inner or spiritual process, it excluded the physical processes of work and nature. At the same time, however, nature also began to assume an aesthetic value reflective of a kind of inner, human spirituality. The growing interest from the end of the eighteenth century in landscapes, in the sublime, and in the picturesque-all of which tended to efface or idealize the physical pro- cesses of both nature and work-offered one expression of this new valorization of ideal nature. This dual split may be summarized in the form of a diagram: IDEAL Amoldian sublime, CULTURE highculture picturesque NATURE physical, fecund, e.g. "luxuriant agriculture misgrowth" MATERIAL For cultural critics such as Coleridge and Matthew Arnold, culture came to designate what today we call "high culture." Indeed, there could be no other kind of culture, for the important separation was not so much between culture and nature as between culture (by definition an aesthetic and intellect- ual phenomenon) and the more physical, material processes of life, wheth- er in nature or society.1 What most threatened this view of culture were what today we would identify as other cultures or perhaps as popular culture in gen- eral. Coleridge and Wordsworth both decry the growing influence of popular taste-what Coleridge calls "the luxuriant misgrowth of our activity: a Read- ing Public" (qtd. in Klancher 4). For Arnold, the threat has become the mid- dle-class "philistines" and the "hebraism" of Protestant taste and rigidity. Even the most dismissive nineteenth-century critics of popular taste, however, held out the possibility that the masses could appreciate culture, as long as its production and distribution remained under the control of a privileged elite. In "The Constitution of Church and State" (1830), Coleridge proposes that a small group of men, the "clerisy," be established "at the fountain-heads of the humanities . . . cultivating and enlarging the knowledge already possessed," and supervising a larger group of cultural missionaries whose job it would be "to diffuse through the whole community, and to every native enti- SPRING 1992 297</page><page sequence="5">Donald Ulin tied to its laws and rights, that quantity and quality of knowledge which was indispensable both for the understanding of those rights, and for the perform- ance of the duties correspondent" (693). Here we have a notion of culture, later extended by Matthew Arold in Culture and Anarchy (1869), as independent from and even in opposition to physical labor. Culture, according to Cole- ridge's plan, is dispensed by the most civilized (i.e., the farthest from the con- dition of unimproved nature and hence from physical work) to the receptive few in the lower and middle classes-classes somehow intermediate between uncultivated nature and cultivated society and often figured in terms of the former. Coleridge clearly envisions a close relationship between high culture and physical labor, but one in which culture is brought to bear as a corrective in the all-too-material world. II The material results of culture-in the sense of cultivation and agricul- ture-are central to On the Origin of Species (1859). It is, after all, principally on an analogy to plant and animal breeding that Darwin rests his theory: "if feeble man can do much by his power of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change ... which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection" (109). Thus nature functions actively as the agent of natural culture (in the early, physical sense) in the same way that the bota- nist or farmer effects artificial culture. Change does not simply take place; it is "effected ... by nature's power." Readers have often noted that Darwin's success owes a great deal to this simple but elegant and powerful analogy (see Smith for an extended discussion of Darwin's use of this syllogism). What I find especially relevant is that Darwin is drawing an analogy, not between two me- chanical processes, but between two cultural processes. Race horses run fast because of artificial selection by horse breeders; if antelope run fast, it must be due to the analogous process of natural selection. In this way, agriculture be- comes a trope through which the social and the natural are unified as a single cultural endeavor. In his second major work, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), Darwin no longer uses the term "culture" in the explicitly agricul- tural sense, but speaks instead of "intellectual culture" (1: 61), "moral culture" (1: 101), and "culture of the mind" (1: 178). To this extent, it would seem that Darwin is consistent with the newer Victorian, or Amoldian, idea of culture as "the best that has been thought and said" (Arold, Culture 6). But, if Darwin has kept up with his age in viewing culture as internal, moral, and intellectual, he is less prepared than Arold to separate culture from productive work and from the productive side of nature. VICTORIAN STUDIES 298</page><page sequence="6">A CLERISY OF WORMS IN DARWIN'S INVERTED WORLD This refusal to separate the physicallmaterial from the cultural can be glimpsed in Darwin's earliest work where an almost Wordsworthian aesthetic is based on complex, ongoing processes rather than arrested moments. In his comparison of Darwin and Wordsworth, David Bromwich notes the heroic effort of abstraction by which they looked at a thing with eyes no poet or naturalist had ever looked with before, and saw in it the slow processes that had gone to its formation, and nothing but those processes, and still were moved and interested by what they saw. (147) For Darwin, nature is not a metaphor for perfection, as it had so often been before for poets and scientists, but a metaphor for ever-changing life complete with all its death and fecundity. For both Darwin and Wordsworth, the evoca- tive power of nature stems not from its teleological import, but from the story it tells of its own processes. As we see time and again throughout Darwin's work, beauty consists of interconnections, of variety, and often of systems verging on confusion. A description in The Voyage of the Beagle (1839) of a Brazilian rain forest suggests a particularly kinetic and various conception of nature: "The elegance of the grasses, the novelty of the parasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the glossy green of the foliage, but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation, filled me with admiration" (12; emphasis added). Whereas for Coleridge the biological metaphor of "luxuriance" carries a threatening qual- ity, the same term for Darwin is sufficient to describe the most admirable char- acteristics of this scene. In the Origin, Darwin employs a similar image in his closing lines: It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and so dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. (490) Indeed, that deep respect for the tangled webs of nature made up of innumera- ble organisms motivates all of Darwin's work, from The Voyage of the Beagle to his last book, on earthworms. Beyond simply presenting the fecundity of nature as a new object for our admiration, however, Darwin gives us a sense of nature (both in the form of its individual organisms and as a larger entity in itself) as actively working toward the generation, evaluation, and preservation of aesthetic criteria. Ac- cording to the theory of sexual selection, evolution, at least of the higher animals, is guided primarily by the choices made by the females in selecting their mates-choices based for each species on a unique aesthetic sensibility. In describing courtship among birds, Darwin asks, "Does the male parade his charms with so much pomp and rivalry for no other purpose? Are we not justi- fied in believing that the female exerts a choice, and that she receives the addresses of the male who pleases her most?" (Descent 2: 123). If the female SPRING 1992 299</page><page sequence="7">Donald Ulin indeed exerts such a choice, the argument continues, then the males will be- come more beautiful over the generations as surely as a new breed of pigeons will take on those characteristics deemed beautiful by the breeder.2 What makes sexual selection particularly radical from the point of view of Victorian aesthetics and culture are the suggestions not only that animals have aesthetic sensibilities-a concept disturbing enough in itself-but that there exists a plurality of organic aesthetics. Darwin explicitly wars us that "we must not judge the tastes of distinct species by a uniform standard; nor must we judge by the standard of man's taste" (Descent 2: 67). Even among snails, he says, "it is conceivable that two hermaphrodites, attracted to each others' beauty, might unite and leave offspring which would inherit their parents' beauty" (Descent 1: 327). In the Descent, where the distinction between humans and animals is intentionally blurred, the natural aesthetic, according to which each species reproduces its own kind, must be considered in light of Darwin's evolving con- ception of species. Though he must rely on traditional taxonomy to make his arguments, Darwin is unequivocal in the beginning of the Origin about his dislike for any rigid taxonomic distinctions: I look at the term species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other .. . [;] it does not essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake. (52) For Darwin, species are not ideal, immutable types, but artificial divisions im- posed by scientists; thus, in the vacuum left by the older teleological definition of species, the idea of a specific, organic aesthetic offers a unique possibility in the reconfiguration of the concept of species. The pluralistic idea of "a cul- ture" as one of many possible-and "particular"-social configurations (as in Western culture, Mayan culture, late-nineteenth-century popular culture, etc.) does not appear until late in Darwin's life (OED; Stocking, "Matthew Arnold" 69, Victorian 302-04). Yet we can see this idea informing Darwin's search for new ways of conceptualizing species. Through sexual selection a species exerts its own specific aesthetic to guide its own evolution while guar- anteeing a certain unity of physical characteristics within the species. In this way the boundaries of each species are defined not in terms of an ideal type, but, in part at least, by what amounts to an organic and specific culture. Darwin does not use the term "culture" in this context, but he is conveying the idea, as yet unnamed in Victorian English, through his description of sexual selection. If the idea of cultures-or at the very least, some analogous processes -functioning independently of any European culture threatened bourgeois notions of high culture, the threat becomes still more apparent as Darwin rules VICTORIAN STUDIES 300</page><page sequence="8">A CLERISY OF WORMS IN DARWIN'S INVERTED WORLD out any clear separation between aesthetic cultural practices and those that are part of the more physical activities of life. By implicating every one of those cultures-including, by extension, all human culture-in material life, the Darwinian natural aesthetic threatens the cultural/material dichotomy at the heart of Arnold's rarified, ideal culture. The high-culture notion that working people-even if they have the inclination-are too busy getting by to develop the skills necessary for an appreciation of true culture becomes meaningless when we consider all life as engaged in a continuous struggle to get by and then recognize innumerable cultural processes growing out of that very struggle. As important as sexual selection is in guiding the development of a species, it does not, like "the best that has been thought and said," transcend the contingen- cies of material history and physical nature. Rather, sexual selection "will also be dominated by natural selection for the general welfare of the species. Hence the manner in which individuals of either sex or of both sexes are affected through sexual selection cannot fail to be complex in the highest degree" (De- scent 1: 296). As beautiful as the results of sexual selection may be, the aesthetic of any animal is directly implicated in the physical life of the species. Male birds do not become beautiful strictly for beauty's sake, but as a practical means of ensuring the inheritance of their own physical characteristics. Moreover, any aesthetic must negotiate with needs and restrictions imposed by natural selection, such as protective coloration, strength, and size constraints. Al- though we can't link any particular aesthetic to a particular material source, that aesthetic can only function in the context of the reproduction of the species. To the extent that the two can be separated, the aesthetic component of animal culture always functions in the service of species' material lives. III Darwin leaves us with a discrepancy between the pluralistic view he takes of animal aesthetics and the distaste with which he describes members of his own species. Nor is he especially subtle concerning his preference: "He who has seen a savage in his native land will not feel much shame, if forced to acknowledge that the blood of some more humble creature flows in his veins" (Descent 2: 404). Stanley Edgar Hyman explains this discrepancy in terms of what he sees as Darwin's version of the millennial myth of fall and redemption. While Darwin allows animals their own cultural and aesthetic sense and stands in awe of the complexity of nature, he frequently designates for non-European people a cultural status not only lower than Europeans, but lower than other animals as well. Considering the Fuegians-"the most miserable and abject creatures I anywhere beheld"-Darwin tells us that one can hardly make oneself believe that they are fellow creatures, and inhabitants of the same world. It is a common subject of conjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower SPRING 1992 301</page><page sequence="9">Donald Ulin animals can enjoy: how much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to these barbarians! (Voyage 213) According to Hyman's reading, "[t]he human power that will return man to Edenic innocence and undo the Fall or Descent, is culture.... Thus biological man is a poor mammal, but cultural man is little lower than the angels" (51). Attractive as it appears, Hyman's argument falls into a typical trap of archetypal theories by failing to consider the rapidly shifting epistemological interrelationships among such ideas as culture, nature, and class in Victorian society. Hyman explains rather enigmatically that "Darwin precedes the use of the word [culture] in its present-day broad anthropological usage for all non- biological inheritance" (51). But "culture" neither has nor had any fixed mean- ing as the boundaries between human and animal, civilized and uncivilized, nature and culture, were-and still are-fluctuating dramatically. Hyman's distinction between "biological man" and "cultural man" is continually under- mined by Darwin's own intentional imbrication of the categories "cultural" and "natural" throughout his work. For Darwin, culture never-any more than nature-carries the transcendent power that it does for Arnold. That is not to say that Darwin doesn't place tremendous value on culture, only that Darwinian culture, unlike Amoldian or Coleridgean culture, always expresses its relationship to its physical/material roots. Hence, Darwinian culture can- not, as Hyman argues, act contrary to, or even as a corrective to, the material conditions of a species's existence. If Darwin tells us to look to the animals for an explanation of who we are, we must at the same time study our own lives and culture to understand animals and even plants. Darwin takes us directly to human culture for analo- gies by which to understand nature in descriptions of the "marriage arrange- ments" of fish and reptiles (Descent 1: 271), remarks on the solicitude of a male crab for his "wife" (1: 334), or the question of the possibility of "female quadru- peds exerting. . . any choice in their marriage unions" (2: 269). (Yeazell offers a good cultural reading of Darwin's courtship plots, mostly from the Descent.) In the opening to his section on the "decorations" of birds, Darwin invokes an analogy embracing all humans as well as birds: "As with the artificial orna- ments used by savage and civilized men, so with the natural oraments of birds, the head is the chief seat of decoration" (2: 71). Yet, by the end of the book, even the distinction between "artificial" and "natural" aesthetic categories is dismantled, for not only do animals practice strikingly human rituals, but humans have likewise adopted the natural aesthetic in the form of feathered hats and fur coats. While favorable identifications between animal and human culture most often invoke middle- and upper-class culture, Darwin's analogies do, in fact, involve a wide spectrum of human society as in the following com- parison: "With respect to female birds feeling a preference for particular males, we must bear in mind that we can judge of choice being exerted, only by plac- VICTORIAN STUDIES 302</page><page sequence="10">A CLERISY OF WORMS IN DARWIN'S INVERTED WORLD ing ourselves in imagination in the same position." If we are asked here to behave like birds, the very next sentence makes it clear that we already do: If an inhabitant of another planet were to behold a number of young rustics at a fair, courting and quarreling over a pretty girl, like birds at one of their places of assemblage, he would be able to infer that she had the power of choice only by observing the eagerness of the wooers to please her, and to display their finery. (2: 122) In whose position, then, are we asked to place ourselves? The introduction of "an inhabitant of another planet" offers the overly delicate reader a position outside the fray of nature and the fair, but to take that position is hardly an honest move, for like "the difference in mind between man and the higher animals," the difference between classes, "great as it is, is certainly one of de- gree and not kind" (1: 105). IV Reference to the fair as one site, even if a metaphorical one, of the blurring of culture/nature distinctions brings us to yet another way in which Darwin's use of the idea of culture subverts the dominant bourgeois notion of culture in his time. In breaking down traditional distinctions between mental activity and instinct, between humans and animals, and even between animals and plants in favor of a tangled, shifting web of interconnections, Darwin is invoking the kind of"camivalesque" that Mikhail Bakhtin finds subversive in the work of Rabelais. Rabelaisian discourse subverts the dominant ideology by reversing the distinctions that uphold that ideology. In Rabelais, Bakhtin argues, all movement is downward from the mind to the lower parts of the body, especially to the anus and genitals. Bakhtin describes one example in which-in mockery of religious miracles-a man is brought back to life: First, there is breath from the mouth and opening of the eyes. Then comes debasement: yawning (a lower sign of life), sneezing (still lower, a kind of elimination), and finally, breaking wind (the bodily lower stratum, the anus). ... Thus we have a complete turn- about, the replacement of the higher by the lower level: it is not the breath from the mouth, but the flatus that appears as the symbol of life and the true sign of resurrection. (382-83) Like Darwin's sexual selection, the reversal of categorical dichotomies repre- sented by what Bakhtin calls the "grotesque" links the biological and the cul- tural, subverting dominant notions of the cultural that would efface such linkage. The grotesque, Bakhtin explains, seeks to grasp in its imagery the very act of becoming and growth, the eternal incomplete unfinished nature of being. . . . Old age is pregnant, death is gestation, all that is limited, narrowly characterized, and completed is thrust into the lower stratum of the body for recasting and a new birth. (52-53) "In the dense atmosphere of the material bodily lower stratum," Bakhtin reiter- ates, objects "are renewed in the sphere of their debasement" (373-74). Bakh- SPRING 1992 303</page><page sequence="11">Donald Ulin tin's description of Rabelaisian life as an "act of becoming and growth, the eternal incomplete unfinished nature of being" could be applied without modification to the Darwinian view of life as well. The grotesque subverts teleology by inverting the static, semiotic systems normally held as guarantees of that teleology. If in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex the cultural and the biological are reversed in what John Durant calls "anthropomorphic zoolo- gy combined with zoomorphic anthropology ... effecting the unification of animals and man, matter and mind, nature and morality" (292), The Formation of Vegetable Mould completes the camivalesque transformation with its narra- tive of biological and cultural renewal through the production and dispersal of immeasurable tons of worm castings deposited over the remains of Classical culture. Just as the camivalesque reverses the social order by debasing the aris- tocracy and crowning the fool king-or as Hamlet's worms send the king on a progress through the guts of a beggar-the image of a distinguished, middle- aged Victorian scientist collecting worm excrement clearly violates norms of Victorian, bourgeois decorum. (Gould notes that while "[m]ost eminent gray- beards sum up their life's thought and offer a few pompous suggestions for re- constituting the future" [v], Darwin turned his attention to earthworms and barnacles.) Nor could Darwin have been entirely insensitive to such a viola- tion, for, while he scrupulously names the scientists on whose work he draws, we find a conspicuous anonymity in the "lady, on whose accuracy I can im- plicitly rely, [who] offered to collect during a year all the castings thrown up on two separate square yards" (87). And, as the upper realm is brought down, objects from the lower realm become the leading figures in Darwin's cultural/ biological narrative. Worm castings are not mere excrement; on the contrary, "[t]hey rise like towers" (106-07). Not only are worms intelligent, as Darwin shows us through the most elaborate experiments and observations, but "their taste is delicate enough to distinguish between different kinds of leaves" (248). Perhaps more clearly than any of Darwin's other books, the book on worms demonstrates the persistent interrelationships between culture/nature as external, physical growth and culture/nature as inner, intellectual, and moral. Worms are intelligent, they have delicate taste, they are capable of sexual pas- sion, and they "perhaps have a trace of social feeling for they are not disturbed by crawling over each other's bodies, and they sometimes lie in contact" (34). But the main value of worms, according to any farmer or gardener, lies in the way they aerate, sift, and enrich the soil: The plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable of man's inventions; but long before he existed the land was in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to be thus ploughed by earthworms. It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures. (313) The message is clear: "a vast number of worms live unseen by us beneath our feet" (158), where they carry on a full complement of cultural activities, largely VICTORIAN STUDIES 304</page><page sequence="12">A CLERISY OF WORMS IN DARWIN'S INVERTED WORLD through the agency of their excrement. And furthermore, they have a longer lineage than even the most eminent English families. Darwin's use of the term "taste" to describe earthworms' food prefer- ences implies not only a conscious choice on the part of the worms, but an aesthetic one as well. "Taste," the same term used to describe the ability of an art connoisseur to discriminate between good and bad art, becomes in this context the means by which an earthworm discriminates between types of food. Though its principal aim is not anthropomorphic, Darwin's last mono- graph exemplifies the tendency throughout his work to link categories and efface dualisms (in this case the biological and the aesthetic). Once such hierarchical distinctions are effaced, the need for a cultural clerisy becomes especially hard to imagine, for culture-while no longer exclusively physical, as in agriculture -is nevertheless produced, mediated, consumed, and perpetuated through physical activities and especially through the work involved in "getting by." Hyman, the only writer I have found to address the cultural criticism implicit in Darwin's book on earthworms, applies a psycho-structuralist model to Darwin's discussion of sexuality, noting that A good deal of eroticism repressed in connection with human sexuality gets released in the accounts of animal sexuality.... The sexuality of the lower animals in the Descent is wildly surrealist .... Among the higher animals, there are scenes like nothing so much as French bedroom farce. (54) Indeed, we could add numerous other examples to this list of fantasy material: the view from the Beagle of the Fuegians flitting seductively among the bushes; "the naked, bronze-like figure of the old man with his little boy, riding like a Mazeppa on the white horse" (Voyage 105); the rank fecundity found in such passages as the "entangled bank" paragraph at the end of the Origin; and the scatological images of the book on worms. Hyman's Freudian narrative of sub- limation and displacement, like the millennial narrative of fall and resurrec- tion through culture, offers a conceptual tool for understanding one element of Darwinian sexuality. But, while Freud's interest in fantasy and dreams rested primarily with uncovering the latent dream material, the manifest expression of repressed sexuality offers a text profoundly subversive of bourgeois cultural values. Nineteenth-century reformers attempted to suppress expressions of au- thentic working-class culture from music halls to carnivals and bear-baiting. In exchange, the working class was offered military and trades fairs, carefully or- chestrated folk-dance revivals, and other forms of culture that could be cen- trally controlled and that were more supportive of the emergent class structure. Most of the reform literature of this period supports this repression by linking cleanliness, morality, and respect for the law. Thus Edwin Chadwick, for ex- ample, argues that the "fever nests and seats of physical depravity are also the seats of moral depravity, disorder, and crime" (qtd. in Stallybrass and White SPRING 1992 305</page><page sequence="13">Donuld Uin 131). Working-class populations were often figured as only partially human, or as undifferentiated, uncontrollable masses. Sidney Godolphin Osbore notes that in his visits to Glasgow slums he found little evidence of drunkenness, a commendable "love of ornament," and neither blasphemy nor begging. Never- theless, he describes the poverty itself as a "festering mass of depraved physical matter ... [,] one of the deep dirt-pools of social life, in which the accumulat- ed filth lay, for its season, quiet and inoffensive" (10-11). Human-animal, civilized-uncivilized, clean-dirty, culture-anarchy: these dichotomies, locked together in the bourgeois mind associated the human, the civilized, the clean, and the cultured as an inseparable set of values. On the other hand we find, equally indissociable, the uncivilized, the dirty, and the anarchic. The second set in all its forms threatened the bourgeois order which conceived itself in terms of the first. Those who neglected the orderliness of their own bodies, it seemed, threatened the orderliness of the body-politic as well. The response to this threat came in the form of greater enumeration, surveillance, and control of working-class populations through more efficient police forces, public hy- giene movements, national censuses, and state-sponsored cultural activities. Read in this context, the camivalesque sexuality in Darwin's work takes on a distinctly political cast as it undermines the value system through which a bourgeois cultural hegemony was being imposed on the working class. For Dar- win, clear categories, such as "species," are non-existent or, at best, uninteresting heuristic devices. The really productive spaces for Darwin are the indeterminate ones: the climbing plants, the flying fish, the duck-billed platypus (omithorhyn- chus), and the "entangled banks." Nor are the great cultural monuments limited to the ideas of a few great men: tiny coral "architects" produce fabulous islands and atolls, while thousands of unknown worms smooth the lawns of England, protect ancient cultural artifacts, and make agriculture possible. Hyman finds a moral in Darwin's preoccupation with excrement and copulation: "out of dirt and decay come life and value" (78). And yet the Vic- torian bourgeoisie were all too aware of the existence of the life teeming in dirt and decay, and all too anxious to repress that life as dangerous to conceptions of an ordered society. In one of his most famous phrases, Matthew Arnold captures precisely the value that the bourgeoisie would expect to see rising out of dirt and decay: that dangerous value of "doing as one likes."3 So, if Darwin offers a world brought to life by uninhibited sexuality and excrement, it is an upside-down world deeply threatening to the sensibilities of his bourgeois audi- ence. The masses in the bourgeois mind were already figured in naturalistic terms, but always in terms that implied a lack of culture. By retaining a sense of the productivity of nature as well as a material basis for culture, Darwin posits an ineluctable, productive link between nature and even the "highest" forms of Amoldian culture. VICTORIAN STUDIES 306</page><page sequence="14">A CLERISY OF WORMS IN DARWIN'S INVERTED WORLD The elimination of the ideal, the prior, and the original makes room for the material, the immediate, and the contingent. In its organic aspect as well as in its connection to the reproduction of material life, this contingent, mate- rial view of culture leaves open the possibility for a mass, or working-class, culture at a time when bourgeois cultural critics were working to appropriate the term "culture" as one means of controlling the working class. An aesthetic rooted in the reproduction of the conditions of existence undermines the foun- dation for Coleridge's "clerisy" and for Arold's elaborate schemes to bring high culture to the masses. Amold's own ironic "conclusion that our hairy ancestor carried in his nature ... a necessity for Greek" ("Literature" 135) only indicates that he has misunderstood Darwin's radically contingent, mate- rial conception of the aesthetic. Nature for Darwin is no more fixed than cul- ture. Darwin's inversion of the status quo ordering of life-as in the very title, The Descent of Man, or in the image of Classical architecture preserved under tons of worm castings-is in itself subversive. When Darwin tells us at the beginning of his book that "[e]arthworms abound in England in many different stations" (Formation 9), he is using the term "station" as the nineteenth-century equivalent of what ecologists today call a "niche"-or that portion of a particular ecosystem with which a given species interacts. But the use of "station" in the context of class precedes its use as a biological term. The sociological term, while metaphorically describ- ing a biological phenomenon, inscribes cultural values in nature. And yet, as nineteenth-century biologists drew on terminology laden with cultural values to describe nature, they could not help but vest those same values with new, "scientific" validation. It is in that continuous and rapid oscillation between the naturalization of society and the socialization of nature that new language and new ways of seeing arise. As conceptions of community, culture, nature, and the individual shifted in the radical restructuring of nineteenth-century European society, the uncertainty inherent in these changing ideas opened for Darwin a significant new space in which to develop new models of cultural and natural relationships. Indiana University NoTEs 1 In his discussion of Matthew Arnold and E. B. Tylor, George Stocking notes that for Arold, the phrase "primitive culture" would have been an oxymoron (87). We could say the same for such phrases as "mass culture," "popular culture," or "working-class culture." 2The significance of gender in Darwin's theory of sexual selection deserves a more thorough treatment than it has yet received and is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. Writers who have addressed this issue include Yeazell and Bender. 3While Arold attributed much of England's "anarchy" to liberal, middle-class reformers, he nevertheless shared with them a fear of the unruly masses who were generally figured as dirty, diseased, and animalistic.
