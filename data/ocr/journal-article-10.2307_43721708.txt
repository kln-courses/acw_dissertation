<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is the Truth of the First Commandment Known by Reason? DALE PATRICK Drake University Des Moines, I A 50311 The commandment, "You shall not have (any) other gods before me," is presented as a divine revelation (Exod 20:3 || Deut 5:7). How does the audience of this text know the revelation to be true? When one is issued a command, one invariably assesses whether the conduct enjoined is right or good. How does the audience of this text know that it is right not to worship or obey any deity but Yhwh? The answer to this question will determine whether the commandment belongs to rational or to revealed truth (to use traditional theological terminology). Over the history of Christian theology, theologians have frequently made a distinction between truths which can be demonstrated by rational argument or grasped by some other natural faculty, and truths which God graciously reveals to the people whom he loves. One might trace this division back to Paul, who holds that the existence of God and responsibility for his moral law can be established by reason (Romans 1-2), whereas God's will to save sinners can be communicated only by an action of God which redeems the will and mind of the recipient (Romans 3-4). Frequently, the natural knowledge of God has been equated with rational knowledge, but since the Romantic era some theologians have held that poetic intuition, personal and social experience, and the structures of the subconscious mind and of language may be "organs" of spiritual 423</page><page sequence="2">424 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 knowledge.1 These remain in the realm of natural knowledge - the working of the human mind without supernatural intervention or empowerment. The reader may find it rather odd and old-fashioned to take up this question. The division of the knowledge of God into revelation and reason does not arise, in any obvious sense, from the biblical text, so why should we import it? Nor is it a common categorization within our own culture - it belongs rather to an archaic tradition of dogmatic and philosophical theology. What meaning can it have for a culture in which no one but the scientist is certain that we know anything except that our minds can play tricks on us? I believe James Barr has demonstrated the division's viability and illuminating power in his Gifford Lectures, which were devoted to demon- strating the presence of "natural theology" in the Old and New Testaments.2 While he himself is somewhat ambivalent about dividing the theological teaching of Scripture between "natural" and "revealed,"3 his argument itself shows clearly that some biblical passages engage in apologetics aimed at the power of human reason and that biblical teaching as a whole assumes a common human knowledge, embedded in the language, institutions, and cultural heritage which ancient Israel and the early church shared with their neighbors. If the "natural" component of biblical theological teaching can be identified, what God communicates to those with whom he is gracious should also be capable of description. I propose to characterize it by its rhetoric. By rhetoric, I mean the way a speaker or author establishes and manages a relationship with an audience through language (and gesture). To achieve the desired effect, it is necessary in serious discourse to con- vince the audience of the truth of what is said. The audience must come to an understanding of the truth-claim, and must understand how it is to be confirmed, before it can acquiesce in the attitude or policy commended by the rhetor. The interpreter of a text must self-consciously join the audience in order to discover how the discourse claims to be true, and what sort of truth this is. 1 I would classify Langdon Gilkey, Naming the Whirlwind: The Renewal of God- Language (Indianapolis/ New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1969) among them. 2 Published as J. Barr, Biblical Faith and Natural Theology (Gifford Lectures for 1991, delivered in the University of Edinburgh; Oxford: Clarendon, 1993). 3 For example, he says (ibid., 195) that "there is no absolute distinction between reve- lation and natural theology."</page><page sequence="3">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 425 I In another recent writing, Barr argues that the first commandment, like the commandments against such acts as murder, adultery, and theft, is the product of natural theology.4 The people of Israel believed that killing, adultery and theft were wrong before prohibitions of Yhwh against them were formulated as prohibitions of Yhwh, so the people found it quite natural that Yhwh should condemn such actions. In other words, these were expres- sions of natural law. For ancient Israel, the same could be said about honoring only one God. This people, or some influential group within it, had practiced a practical "monotheism" for some time. When they heard the commandment, they concurred in it as a truth their community had known from time immemorial. To me it seems possible, indeed plausible, that monotheism, in the sense of a situation where a people had only one god who really and essentially mattered, was "natural" in Israel. It was a conviction already general and socially accepted, to begin within a particular group no doubt, eventually throughout Israelite society. ... A group, possibly quite a small group to begin with, was fanatically monotheistic, and its concentration on its one god succeeded in establishing itself as the national faith.5 Barr does not fully explicate the reasoning by which he arrives at this con- clusion.6 We might supply an argument from an earlier book. The Bible, he observes, does not record any origin of the knowledge of the one God. This deity is depicted as the creator, without rival or significant collaborator, and there is no interruption of the knowledge of this God in the subsequent narrative. There is no stage at which God is not known. This is indeed one of the ways in which the idea of tradition is defined. Tradition is not everything that was said or passed on, but that which was passed on in an historical current in which it was recognized that the true God was known.7 Barr seems to infer from this literary fact a consciousness of having had only one God from time immemorial. Barr carries this thesis on into the postexilic period, when Israelite authors began to set forth rationalistic arguments for monotheism: 4 J. Barr, "Biblical Law and the Question of Natural Theology," The Law in the Bible and Its Environment (ed. T. Veijola; GÃ¶ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1990) 18-20. 5 Ibid., 18-19. Barr does share a train of thought in Biblical Faith, 144-46, but its exegetical basis and theoretical power are anemic. 7 J. Barr, Old and New in Interpretation : A Study of the Two Testaments (Currie Lec- tures, 1964; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966) 89.</page><page sequence="4">426 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 One way or another, for the group concerned, a sort of monotheism was "natural," was the given way in which people thought. This was not "natural theology" in the sense of dependence upon philosophical thinking with its uni- versal categories, but it was "natural" in that for the group concerned it already was the normal awareness of deity. Once established, however, monotheism could quickly form links and contacts with universal philosophical categories, and this is what took place, in Judaism certainly in the Greek period but probably even before.8 The rationalistic natural theology of Hellenistic Judaism is the logical out- come of a historical process which implanted monotheism as the taken-for- granted theology of Jews. Of course, this could in turn justify the enterprise of natural theology in the contemporary world. Barr's argument entails two distinct claims: (1) some component of ancient Israel was monotheistic from time immemorial, and (2) this mono- theism was not the product of revelation but the natural predisposition of a human community. The first claim is set over against some recent works trying to trace the emergence of monotheism from polytheism.9 This debate over the genesis and development of Israelite monotheism is outside the purview of this essay. Any position taken in it would be compatible with Barr's theological claim. My interest is in Barr's effort to classify the first commandment as a product of "natural theology." In effect, he abstracts a conceptual content from the first commandment, namely, monotheism, and argues that the origi- nal audience was predisposed to believing in this content. The revelatory form of this commandment was simply a psychological reinforcement of a belief system whose truth was known by reason and experience. I contend that Barr has misclassified the theological status of the first commandment; the reason for this is that he has ignored its rhetoric.10 A commandment is not to be reduced to its conceptual content; it effects some- thing between the speaker and audience as well. To put this pointedly, a commandment is a distinctive type of utterance which creates the reality it 8 Barr, "Biblical Law," 19-20. 9 Such works as Bernhard Lang, Monotheism and the Prophetic Minority: An Essay in Biblical History and Sociology (Social World of Biblical Antiquity Series 1; Sheffield: Almond, 1983), and Mark S. Smith, The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israeli San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1990). 10 Although I am writing this piece to dispute Barr's thesis, I want to express my respect for his scholarship and theological reasoning. I studied with him during a sabbatical year in 1975, and I consider his mind one of the keenest and most judicious in his generation. His thought always has to be taken into account; even when he arrives here at a position that I must oppose, he has had the clarity of mind to see that the question needs to be addressed forthrightly.</page><page sequence="5">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 427 describes. Its revelatory form, in this case, coheres with its constitutive char- acter: the authority of the utterance depends upon the act of the speaker exercising authority. What I have said applies to all commandments. The first commandment differs from the others by the claim on the audience it makes for the speaker. Yhwh, the God of Israel, claims Israel's exclusive recognition of himself as God. The other divine commandments govern particular actions by Israelites, making them duties owed Yhwh as well as reasonable rules for communal life; they do not, however, establish and maintain Yhwh's unique position in the community - the first commandment performs that unique function. The remainder of this essay will focus on the first commandment. The bulk of it will be devoted to describing the type of utterance it is and how that utterance makes a truth-claim upon its audience. Once we have accom- plished that, we can set forth the case in favor of classifying it as revealed, privileged truth. Describing the rhetoric of the first commandment is more complex than one might think. The truth of the commandment depends upon the authority of the speaker and the suasive power of the speaker's communication. This means that we must also examine the way Yhwh's authority is grounded and the means used to persuade the audience that he is deserving of authority. The next four sections proceed through the analysis step by step. II According to the biblical narrative of Exodus in its extant form, the enunciation of the first commandment creates an obligation of the people of Israel to recognize only one God, Yhwh. Even if the people were monotheistic by rational persuasion, the fact of their monotheism creates no moral obligation to recognize one God alone. It might be thought stupid or naive to recognize other gods, but doing so becomes wrong only by commandment. Why is this so? Here J. L. Austin's concept of performative utterances comes to our aid.11 Much human discourse is "declaratory," made up of statements about what can be judged by reason and experience. The argu- ment of this article is of this sort. To evaluate the truth of my analysis, the reader will examine the evidence, reason through the theory, and so on, to determine how well it fits. 11 J. L. Austin, How to Do Things with Words (William James Lectures, 1955; 2d ed.; Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, 1975); idem, "Performative Utterances," Philosophical Papers (3d ed.; New York: Oxford University, 1979) 220-39.</page><page sequence="6">428 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 A significant class of human discourse, however, does not have an abstractable content which can be evaluated independently of the statement; it creates the reality it describes. These utterances Austin named "perfor- mative." Promises and pledges, commands, expressions of feelings and atti- tudes, and judicial judgments all belong to this class.12 They have the power to do something between speaker and audience. A promise, for example, binds the speaker to a course of action and elicits the trust of the recipient in the speaker's willingness and capacity to deliver. A commandment, on the other hand, binds the audience to a course of action. It is an exercise in socially sanctioned authority. The addressees are duty-bound to obey if they belong to the social structure bestowing authority on the speaker. If the first commandment was uttered by one in authority, its "truth" consisted in its obligation-creating power. The addressees were duty-bound to obey it simply because they were duty-bound to obey every commandment of the one who spoke. Whether they desired to obey it, or thought it a wise or beneficial or morally compelling policy, was irrelevant; whether they were monotheists or polytheists was irrelevant; it was their duty to obey the law- giver that made it a valid commandment. According to Exodus 19-20, the first commandment was enunciated by Yhwh himself, speaking to his people from heaven. Yhwh had the authority in Israel to command, as we shall see in subsequent sections. The first com- mandment imposes the duty to withhold recognition of any other deity; none was to be granted the authority to make law or to receive the honor appro- priate to one having that authority. Yhwh alone could have imposed this obligation: it would be self-contradictory for another deity to do so, and any human that did so on his or her own authority would be presumptuous.13 Of course, one of the people might raise the question whether it really was Yhwh's commandment. Exod 20:1 says that he spoke these words directly to Israel, but one could always question whether it was heard cor- rectly, or whether its implications were understood. A reader of the text might allege that it was really Moses, or the authors of the text, who enun- ciated it. Such might be the objection of a modern skeptical reader, at any rate, but it would be hard to imagine how one could acknowledge Yhwh's authority and doubt all means of communication. To deny that Yhwh prohibited the recognition of any other deity, in view of this narrative, is tantamount to denying his authority altogether. 12 See R. Jensen, The Knowledge of Things Hoped For: The Sense of Theological Dis- course (New York: Oxford University, 1969) 114-18. 13 That is, presumptuous to ascribe a claim for Yhwh that he has not authorized. Jacob does admonish his family to "put away the foreign gods that are among you" (Gen 35:2, cp. Josh 24:23), but this does not in itself make a claim of exclusive recognition.</page><page sequence="7">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 429 If the reader of the text acknowledges Yhwh's authority, he or she will have to acknowledge an obligation to the commandment. The subject, how- ever, will reserve a certain independence vis-Ã -vis one in authority. When a commandment is given, he or she will judge its desirability - doing so according to a broad range of criteria, from its conformity with their interests to its moral compellingness. If his or her judgment is in agreement with the commandment, the issue of the authority of the speaker does not come up. If the audience's judgment is at variance with the speaker's, the audience must decide whether it will comply with authority, simply because the final decision as to what is right belongs to authority, or will resist or even rebel. The issue between speaker and audience becomes one of duty and integrity. The wording of the first commandment projects an audience which would resist the commandment's exclusivism. It seems to assume the existence of other gods, or at least the audience's belief in them and attraction to them. The commandment requires the audience to withhold any honor or allegiance to any supernatural being or power to which they might be attracted. The willingness of the people to comply with the commandment does not depend upon their natural inclinations, but upon their submission to Yhwh's authority. Ill Our train of thought requires that we briefly consider the type of authority Yhwh exercised in Israel. The tradition of both the synagogue and the church has tended toward the Lord's absolute, unquestioned authority. "Whate'er my God ordains is right," runs an old Protestant hymn. In response to Socrates' disjunctive either/or, Do the gods will something because it is right, or is it right because the gods will it?14 this tradition comes down firmly on the side of the latter. From a rhetorical point of view, this authoritarian position gives full weight to the "formalist" definition of authority, and ignores or downplays the "transaction" with the audience. The tradition James Barr represents opts for the other horn of the dilemma, to wit, that God wills something because it is right. Barr notes that the ethical commandments articulate a "natural law," norms which had developed in Israel apart from divine revelation; all that revelation does is to give these norms added force and clarity. When the commandments were promulgated, the audience could confirm their validity in their conscience. Rhetorically speaking, this position weights the suasive component of authority much more than the formal. 14 Plato Euthyphro 10a.2.</page><page sequence="8">430 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 It seems to me that the best position on this question would recognize both the formal and the suasive components. The exercise of authority does create, rather than reinforce, obligation. The Israelite who accepted Yhwh's claim upon the people would grant him final say as to what is right, even though he or she might raise questions about his decision. There was, never- theless, a right to raise questions. Jer 12:1 articulates this dialectic between formal authority and suasion nicely. Righteous art thou, Yhwh, when I complain to thee; yet I would plead my case before thee.15 Jeremiah grants Yhwh final authority in the very act of raising questions about his judgments. The natural response to objections is suasion. In the case of the first commandment, Yhwh will have to persuade a band of polytheists that an exclusive relationship is beneficial, that he is sufficient to Israel's needs. In actual fact, according to the biblical narrative, many Israelites were not persuaded. Only as Israel lived with the first commandment, and in contra- diction to it, for centuries did the people as a whole become persuaded that Yhwh was sufficient. Along the way, narratives and poetry were composed to convince the people that they belonged solely to Yhwh, material which forms the nucleus of the Pentateuch and other works. According to the biblical story, it was Yhwh's judgment that settled the issue, which is to say, his exercise of sanctioning authority conditioned the people of Israel to fulfill an obligation which had not been decided by reason or experience.16 To put it colloquially, they learned that he meant business. In sum, the first commandment is a performative utterance which cre- ated obligation in the act of speaking. Its validity depended not upon the rational or experiential confirmation of its Tightness but on the authority of Yhwh to command. However, suasion was required as well. The narrative and poetic tradition celebrating Yhwh's might and faithfulness were designed to do that, but when gentle persuasion failed, he exercised judgment for breaking faith. IV How did Israel incur the obligation to obey Yhwh, the one who jealously guards his exclusive right to Israel's recognition? Perhaps his authority is "by nature," which is to say, by his position in the hierarchy of being. 15 Translations of the OT are those of the RSV with some minor changes. 16 In the process, the prophets subject the "gods" to a theological critique - a decisive step on the way to formal monotheism.</page><page sequence="9">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 431 If so, he could be compared to a parent whose authority derives from being a procreator of a child. Perhaps a hereditary monarch can also claim the authority to rule his or her kingdom by some principle of natural order.17 On the other hand, political authority can be ascribed to some sort of contact or consent of the governed, historical or implied. In this case, authority derives from an actual or putative performative transaction. Although the biblical narrative derives the authority of the creator over the human race from the order of being (Genesis 1-11), it records perfor- mative transactions establishing Yhwh's authority to command Israel. The premier example of this is the act of covenant making on Mount Sinai (in Exodus 19-20, 24, 34). At least one other passage also portrays a perfor- mative transaction establishing Yhwh's authority over Israel - Joshua 24. Let us examine these texts briefly to observe how the transaction is depicted. The first commandment was first promulgated at Mount Sinai as a part of the covenant between Yhwh and Israel (Exod 20:3 || Deut 5:6; cp. Exod 34:14). How does Yhwh gain the authority to promulgate the command- ment? According to Exod 19:3b-8, the people are offered a choice to accept a relationship with Yhwh in which they will be set apart for him if they acknowledge the binding authority of his will; they accept it by pledging "to do all that Yhwh says" (Exod 19:8, cp. 34:3,7-8). The first commandment is delivered as among the things Yhwh says. As indicated above, this exchange belongs to the domain of performa- tive language. A pledge, a form of promissory language, creates a relation- ship between the parties to it. In this case, Yhwh and Israel exchange pledges, so to speak. Once the pledges are ratified (Exod 24:3-8), the relationship described is in force. A reality exists between the parties which depends upon the commitment of each party to sustain it. "Natural" experience and reason could not discover the truth of the performative utterances, for the reality exists because of them. One can only "believe," that is, accept the claim made by the transaction. The scholar may doubt that the account reports the actual historical origin of the first commandment, but one can hardly deny that it represents a powerful rhetorical legitimation. Members of the audience hearing the account recognize that their ancestors have obligated them by choice. More- over, the story is told in such a way that the audience can identify with these ancestors, accepting their choice as the morally compelling thing to do. The narrative is true in the profound sense of creating a community based upon freely chosen obligations and promises. 17 Cp. James Stuart (King James VI of Scotland, James I of England), "The State of the Monarchy and the Divine Right of Kings," speech at Whitehall, 21 March 1609, British Oration from Ethelbert to Churchill (London: J. M. Dent, 1960) 18.</page><page sequence="10">432 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 Joshua 24 also portrays an act of covenant making which establishes Yhwh's authority over Israel. After a recitation of Yhwh's gracious deeds on the people's behalf, Joshua challenges them in these words: Now therefore fear Yhwh and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve Yhwh. And if you be unwilling to serve Yhwh, choose this day whom you will serve. (Josh 24:14-15) The people reiterate Yhwh's deeds for them and pledge "to serve Yhwh, for he is our God" (v 18). Joshua then warns the people of the consequences of this decision, but they repeat their intention, and a stone is erected in Shechem to witness against any unfaithfulness. The difference between Exodus 19-20 and Joshua 24 is that the former establishes the people's obligation to obey Yhwh and then promulgates the first commandment as Yhwh's will, whereas the latter posits "serving Yhwh" as itself excluding relationships with any other deity. One might even say that in Joshua 24, the exclusive recognition of Yhwh encompasses the obligation to obey whatever commandment he might give. Moreover, in the performa- tive act of pledging to serve Yhwh alone they "put away" other gods (v 23). By this act of renunciation, Yhwh "becomes" Israel's only deity. Joshua 24 is depicted as a renewal of the covenant after the initial phase of the conquest, by the generation of the conquest as it retires from the scene. It performs the function of reinforcing the obligation, accepted at Sinai, to recognize Yhwh alone. If there was a ritual alluded to in the narrative,18 periodic performance of the ritual at Shechem would have made later gene- rations accept responsibility for the decision of their ancestors. To sum up, the transaction between Yhwh and Israel in the promulga- tion of the first commandment is grounded in a narrative of a performative act of exchanging solemn pledges. This makes Yhwh's exclusive claim to Israel's recognition more transactional than a sheer exercise of authority would be; Israel has freely chosen to submit to Yhwh's authority. According to Joshua 24, Israel freely chooses to recognize Yhwh alone in the act of submitting to his authority. Though these accounts are susceptible to doubts regarding their trustworthiness as history, they have the power to persuade subsequent generations to accept responsibility for incurring the obligation; the narrative engages the audience in a performative act. 18 An older generation of scholars thought so: see G. von Rad, "The Problem of the Hexateuch," The Problem of the Hexateuch and Other Essays (tr. Trueman Dicken; Edinburgh/ London: Oliver and Boyd; New York: McGraw Hill, 1966) 20-26.</page><page sequence="11">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 433 V In these foundational narratives, Yhwh's deeds in Israel's past are proclaimed in conjunction with Israel's pledge to abide by his exclusive claim upon them. We need to determine the rhetorical function of these recitations and to differentiate it from that of the pledges and promulgations of com- mandments. To initiate this analysis, I would like to cite an opinion of James Barr regarding the role of the exodus as a source of Israelite "monotheism." "In more recent times," Barr writes, when the centrality of the exodus as a revelatory event was so much emphasized, it was often said that monotheism in its Israelite form emerged as a response to the exodus experience, or as a result of it, or as a reflection on it or as an inference from it. YHWH alone had delivered the people from Egypt, and so they concluded that there was no other god than he. But none of these expla- nations are really convincing: they often depend on an inappropriate mixing of different categories of evidence and theory.19 Whatever the validity of Barr's reasoning regarding the origin of monothe- ism may be, he does not come to grips with the narratives which inculcated the monotheistic idea, and may well have generated it. The proclamation of Yhwh's saving deeds, the exodus above all, is not designed to produce a philosophical generalization, but an existential claim. Yhwh has demon- strated his power and good will, and Israel owes him its praise and service. To substantiate this thesis, I will categorize the rhetorical import of several recitations. First of all, the recitation of Yhwh's deeds is an identity description. This is a salient aspect of Exod 20:2 || Deut 5:6: I am Yhwh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. Yhwh here enunciates an official "autobiography," a history by which he can be identified and distinguished from any other claimant to Israel's loyalty. His autobiography is transactional, a story which includes the audience in second person address. The community itself receives its identity by being incorporated into Yhwh's. In Joshua 24, the recitation of Yhwh's deeds within Israel's history (vv 2- 13) identifies the one about whom the people are deciding (vv 14-15). The people's role in Yhwh's story is even more salient, for the issue is whether 19 Barr, "Biblical Law," 18-19.</page><page sequence="12">434 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 they will "own" this story by pledging their loyalty (vv 16-18). The people are being asked to recognize formally a relationship that has existed for many generations. The recitation of Yhwh's deeds in Exod 19:4 is formulated to persuade the audience that Yhwh is deserving of the status he is asking Israel to give him. The people are being persuaded that their ancestors on Mount Sinai could hardly make any other decision: You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. A subtle coloring has been added to the recitation of his deeds in this pas- sage. Behind the metaphor "bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself" is the intimation of Yhwh's attitude toward this people. He has not only demonstrated his power, he has shown a concern for the welfare of Israel. The expression of feelings and attitudes is another type of performa- tive language.20 Only the speaker knows his or her subjective state, and to testify to it to another has virtually the force of a promise. When Yhwh says, "Look how I have taken care of you," he is intimating that he is well disposed toward Israel and will prove true to their trust. This supports the following offer of favor to Israel (19:5-6). Do these recitations of Yhwh's deeds surreptitiously supplant faith with "natural" experience? That is, could the audience know the truth of Yhwh's claims from experience? There is indeed something of an experiential con- firmation in these declarations. It is not accidental that Israel was not re- quired to pledge to recognize Yhwh alone until after the exodus. Yhwh must earn the implicit allegiance of Israel before he asks Israel to swear to it. Yet, the appeal is of such a personal, transactional character that it requires a response to be evidence. To know the truth of Yhwh's claims to have acted in Israel's behalf, the Israelites must receive the story as an overture. What I am suggesting is that the story of Yhwh's deeds partakes of the performative character of the transaction which it supports. The people's experience has been sufficiently ambiguous to arouse their suspicion - their murmuring - and they will soon break out in overt rebellion. To accept the story as an overture, the people must resolve the ambiguity in favor of Yhwh. The same is true for the audience of the narrative; they (we) know that Yhwh subsequently delivered on all his promises to these people, but their (our) 20 Jensen ( Knowledge , 116) offers the term "behabitive" for this type of performative utterance.</page><page sequence="13">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 435 own experience was (is) also ambiguous. To be accepted as true, the story must be accepted, despite the ambiguity of lived experience. The recitation of Yhwh's saving deeds for Israel leads by a straight- forward dramatic logic to the invitation to Israel to recognize him as their God, which includes his authority to command. It does not, however, add up to an exclusive claim to Israel's devotion. Yhwh's autobiography does not demonstrate that he is the only deity to have acted beneficially in Israel's behalf; it demonstrates only that he is the performer of this particular story of deliverance. From Israel's point of view, Yhwh might be recognized as their national god, but other deities might be recognized over other spheres of life. When the people respond to the recitation by pledging to obey all that Yhwh commands (Exod 19:8), they have not repudiated the claims of other gods, so long as these do not contradict Yhwh's. When the first command- ment is promulgated, the people are forced to make such a repudiation. The first commandment is a logical leap beyond the recitation of Yhwh's deeds and the establishment of his authority. Thus, the commandment has inde- pendent performative force.21 This logical leap cannot be dismissed as a bit of logic chopping, irrelevant to understanding the ancient mind. The stories of apostasy in the histories and the prophetic books seldom involved a full- scale repudiation of Yhwh; they involved rather a resistance to his exclusive claim to Israel's loyalty. To summarize, the recitation of Yhwh's deeds for Israel plays a suasive role in the passages enunciating the first commandment. They are designed to move Israel - the implied audience - to decide to accept the authority of Yhwh and to renounce the claims of any other deity. However, the recitations do not displace the independent performative force of the first command- ment and the necessity of a leap of faith to know its truth. VI We have arrived at the conclusion that the first commandment is a performative utterance within a complex of performative and supportive utterances. Such utterances create the reality they describe. The command- ment binds the audience to an obligation because the speaker, Yhwh, has the authority to impose it. To know its truth, the audience must recognize the 21 Joshua 24, it should be noted, collapses the acceptance of Yhwh's authority and the exclusion of all other deities. The "leap" in this account is from the proclamation of Yhwh's deeds to the recognition of Yhwh's exclusive claim upon Israel's "service."</page><page sequence="14">436 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 authority of the lawgiver. He has attained that authority, according to Exo- dus 19, by the consent of the people. This consent was, in turn, elicited by a recitation of Yhwh's deeds designed to persuade the people that Yhwh was worthy and deserving of their obedience. The type of knowledge attained by the revelation recounted in the exo- dus narrative fits the definition of revealed truth. First, the knowledge is privileged: only those to whom the commandment is addressed - the com- munity which had accepted Yhwh's authority - could "know" it. No one outside this community can know that Yhwh is their only God. One might question whether this is knowledge at all, for it lacks declaratory content. But yes, it is: it is a moral knowledge, a knowledge of what one should and should not do. This moral knowledge cannot be demonstrated by reason or experi- ence.22 It is a logical leap, indeed, a sequence of logical leaps, from Yhwh's proposal that his authority be recognized to his exclusive claim upon the addressees or audience. The only way to know its truth is to obey it. It is also an existential leap, because the commandment prohibits behavior to which the audience is attracted; the audience is called upon to resist its own incli- nations, to obey, though it does not know whether doing so is to its benefit. The obedience demanded is in that sense blind. But there is another side to this obedience: Israel has consented to Yhwh's authority because the people are persuaded that he is a deity worthy of it. They have reason to believe that he is well disposed toward them and will benefit them; indeed, he has explicitly courted them and promised them a great future. So behind the obedience there is trust. The story gives con- fidence to the one making the leap. The audience must appropriate this story and decide to venture a future with him. What we are describing is a performative transaction which creates the reality it describes. The knowledge that comes from the transaction is of a relationship which Israel can enter only by commitments involving trust and obedience. Once entered, it is binding, and any betrayal becomes guilt which is subject to sanctions. Thus, it is an objective knowledge, a knowledge which is true even when the human community has ceased en masse to believe or act upon it. This demonstrates that revelation, considered as performative utterances, cannot be reduced to ideas and attitudes of the believers. 22 There is, to be sure, a natural component: the common moral conviction that one should obey authority and keep promises. The privileged status belongs to the particular command- ment, issued by a particular authority, based upon a particular obligation to recognize that authority.</page><page sequence="15">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 437 In order to show that my way of describing revelation is not overly eccentric or lacking in theological rootage, I propose to correlate it with Soren Kierkegaard's description of natural and revealed religion in Philo- sophical Fragments. Natural religion, or the "religion of immanence," according to Kierkegaard, seeks to discover religious truth from human reason and experience.23 Socrates is its exemplar. He insisted that all purported religious truth, all commands of deity, all myths and piety, be judged by rational ethics and metaphysics.24 There may be divine revelations, such as the oracle to Socrates himself, but their truth depends upon the confirmation of "natural reason." This is precisely what James Barr says about the first commandment. The religion of transcendence, according to Kierkegaard, makes the relationship between the "teacher" and the "disciple" essential to its truth. The teacher is not the midwife or exemplar of the truth but its very embodi- ment. The recipient's relationship to this embodiment determines whether he or she is "in the truth." Kierkegaard has been fashioning this model of reve- lation on Christ,25 but it fits well with Israel's relationship to Yhwh estab- lished in covenant and commandment. So far, Kierkegaard's description of the religion of transcendence fits the transaction involved in the first commandment, as I have expounded it, per- fectly. However, Kierkegaard goes on to say that the teacher not only must enter into relationship with the disciple but must enable the disciple to recog- nize that he is the truth. The recipient of the revelation of the transcendent God cannot know its truth; he or she can only believe it and act upon it. The reason for this, according to Kierkegaard, is that the recipient is in error; the self is seeking to be the center of its own existence, to depend upon its own power. Revelation must have the power to shatter self-confidence and force the recipient to rely upon the Revealer. The negative side of this power is the capacity to offend, to arouse the antipathy of the self bent upon autonomy.26 One might question the applicability of Kierkegaard's use of the concept of error, or sin, to explain why the transcendent God can only be known by revelation. Israel cannot enter into error until the commandment is promul- gated. That is in fact the distinctive thrust of the first commandment: rather than redeeming from sin it creates the possibility of sin. Kierkegaard, though, 23 Soren Kierkegaard, Philosophical Fragments; or, A Fragment of Philosophy (tr. and introduction by David F. Swenson; new introduction and commentary by Niels Thulstrup; tr. revised and commentary translated by Howard V. Hong; Princeton: Princeton University, 1962) 12-16, 28-30, 37-39, 46-50. 24 Plato makes this evident in his Euthyphro and his Apology 25 Kierkegaard, Philosophical Fragments, 16-27, 30-37, 40-45, 53-60. 26 Ibid., 58-67, 85-88.</page><page sequence="16">438 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 would have to accommodate an obligation-creating revelation if he considered the case of Abraham.27 At Sinai, Israel incurs an obligation that no other people owes. This obligation is created in Yhwh's performative utterance. There is one other element of Kierkegaard's definition that needs to be addressed. Not only must the teacher shatter the self-reliance of the disciple in revelation; he must provide the capacity to recognize the truth as well.28 He is assuming the Christian doctrine of the illumination of the Holy Spirit. Jewish interpreters might dismiss that doctrine as an arbitrary imposition on Hebrew Scripture, and most critical scholars would second their objection. One might conclude that the OT witnesses to an innate human capacity to reply faithfully to God's revelation. However, the pentateuchal text does not really have such an optimistic view. No sooner have the Israelites accepted the first commandment than they become involved in building and worship- ping a golden calf (Exodus 32). Only Moses' intercession saves them from obliteration. Obviously the people cannot sustain the commitment to Yhwh alone by their willpower; Yhwh is conducting and compelling them along a way that they could not go on their own. This activity of God is comparable to the work of the Holy Spirit in Christian doctrine. VII During or after the exile, monotheism did emerge as a taken-for- granted belief system of most Jews. At that point, the first commandment, taken in its literal sense, did lose its existential import and came to be seen as a philosophical teaching. Yhwh did not have to provide the condition for accepting its truth, for the people found monotheism the "natural" way to think. It is at this point that Barr's description of monotheism is quite correct. The type of literature known as "idol polemic" is the deposit of this new intellectual environment. These passages ridicule the worship of images - and the gods they represent - as naive and superstitious. One is indeed re- minded of Xenophanes' ridicule of Greek gods.29 For the authors of the idol polemic, there was an incongruity in humans making "gods" comparable to the absurdity Xenophanes found in anthropomorphism. 27 Which of course Kierkegaard does in Fear and Trembling; see S0ren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling and The Sickness unto Death (tr. Walter Lowrie; Garden City, NY : Doubleday, 1955) 64-77 (revision of S. Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling: A Dialectical Lyric [tr. W. Lowrie; Princeton: Princeton University, 19411 79-101). 28 Kierkegaard, Philosophical Fragments, 57-60, 85-88. See Barr, "Biblical Law," 20.</page><page sequence="17">TRUTH OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 439 The question is, Was idol polemic a true and worthy embodiment of the first commandment? What rhetorical purpose did idol polemic serve in exilic and postexilic Judaism? I would suggest that it was designed to weaken the attraction of Gentile religion to Jews and, perhaps, to persuade Gentiles of their folly. Put another way, its primary purpose was to persuade Jews that biblical monotheism is intellectually superior to polytheism. In doing this, the authors transferred the issue from the realm of will - of loyalty and obedience - to that of the intellect: one should not worship "idols," because it is intellectually naive to do so. Idol polemic cultivated the desire to be intellectually superior to polytheists, and in the process it revalued Israel as a "race of superior minds." The existential either/or which required the people of Yhwh to abandon self-will has been transformed into an assertion of self-will. Perhaps this critique of the rhetoric of idol polemic is too harsh. One does detect in it the basic ideas that had been distilled from centuries of reflecting upon why God had issued the first and second commandments.30 In line with the prophetic tradition, idol polemic tended to ascribe the im- pulse behind the production of idols to the human effort at self-salvation.31 Thus, as one author describes it, the woodworker takes wood and carves it into a figure, and the goldsmith plates the figure, then they fall down before it and plead, "Deliver me, for you are my god!" (Isa 4:17). For Xenophanes, idols were a product of the naive mind, but for the biblical authors they were made to fill human need and desire. Hence, in idol polemic it is not the anthropomorphic features of the idols that made them false, but the effort to turn the creature, the product, into a saving power. In this, the authors of idol polemic preserve the tradition of moral obligation involved in the first commandment. Moreover, idol polemic is usually a vehicle of praise for Yhwh. The unreality of the idol is a negative term of comparison for Yhwh, the "living God": They are the work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith; . . . they are all the product of skilled workmen. But Yhwh is truly God, he is the living God and everlasting King. At his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his indignation. (Jer 10:9-10) 30 Although these two were originally separate commandments, by the time of the clas- sical prophets they had been synthesized into a criticism of human religion. This is the best interpretation of Hos 14:3, a part of a confession of sin composed for Israel by the prophet.</page><page sequence="18">440 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 56, 1994 One frequently finds the theme of the incomparability of Yhwh in conjunc- tion with idol polemic.32 For example, To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him? The idol? A workman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold. (Isa 40:18-19) The true God cannot be compared to any material conception realized by humans. The one is the creature of human imagination and skill, the other the creator and ruler of humans. Perhaps we can say that these satires on idolatry, which were implicitly aimed at the gods themselves as well as their images, are to be appreciated as rational apologia for the truth-claims made by the first and second com- mandments. They assured their Israelite audience that there was no reason to break faith with Yhwh. Unfortunately, their appeal could inculcate an intellectual or moral pride as well. These rational arguments also made a public claim, a claim to universal validity, which is not present in the privileged exchange of the first and second commandments. This public claim had the effect of putting the truth- claims of Scripture on a competitive basis with the truth-claims of other religions.33 Israel's obligation to Yhwh now appeared to depend on its basis in rational truth. Thus, one had to attack other religions and claim intellec- tual superiority in order to sustain the obligation. When this was combined with the purity laws, Jews were forced into a conflict-ridden relationship to their environment. Beginning with Paul, the Christian church adopted the same type of argument (Romans 1-2) and opposed the religious environment with the same aggressiveness. The difference was that the Christian church went out to persuade the environment of its folly, indeed of its sinfulness, for not recognizing the one true God.34 Freed from the restrictive force of the purity law, the church could offer a universally accessible community as well. The other side, of course, could, and did, fight back. At an intellectual level, the philosophers could show the irrationality of Jewish and Christian See C. J. Labuschagne, The Incomparability of Yahweh in the Old Testament (Pretoria Oriental Series 5; Leiden: Brill, 1966) 67, 74, 76, 111-12, 123; cp. 140-41. Actually, hellenized Jews made common cause with representatives of the "monothe- istic" philosophical tradition exemplified by Xenophanes, and like them, the hellenized Jews had contempt for the polytheism of the masses. On the meeting and misunderstanding of Jews and hellenistic philosophers, see Yehoshua Amir, "Die Begegnung des biblischen und des philo- sophischen Monotheismus als Grundthema des jÃ¼dischen Hellenismus," EvT 38 (1978) 2-19.

It has required tough theological thinking to maintain the intellectual viability of the doctrines of the religious communities. On the other hand, such thinking has often tamed the power of the biblical depiction of God. These last few paragraphs have been offered as a rough sketch of the dynamics engendered by the rational apologetics of the first and second commandments. There is no retreat available to us at this stage, even if we want to find one. We cannot take refuge in an incorrigible revelation. Never- theless, we can recover a proper sense of the purpose and limits of rational or romantic apologetics. In the end, it is the "reality" created by performative utterances that claims the heart and mind of Jews and Christians, and our rational arguments serve only to lend suasive force to our obligations. 35 One problem is that any language about God, including the rendering of God in the OT, is vulnerable to the same satirical unmasking. Though there are no physical images of Yhwh, it is human language crafted by Israelite authors that delineates his identity. Why should the prophet privilege Israel's linguistic rendering over the plastic representations of other peoples? It would seem that idol polemic pulls down the temple on everyone's head.
