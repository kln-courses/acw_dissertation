<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  CHAPTER ONE MANY GODS COMPLICATIONS OF POLYTHEISM Gods, gods, there are so many there’s no place left for a foot.  Basavanna 1. Order versus Chaos Worn out by hardship, having drifted ashore after two nights and two  days in the seething waves of a stormy sea, Odysseus is hungry. In his  distress he addresses the first—and only—girl that meets his eyes with,  as Homer Od. 6.149–153 reports, the gentle and cunning words: “Are  you a goddess or a mortal woman? If a goddess, it is of Artemis that  your form, stature, and figure (εȢδός τε μέγεθός τε φυήν) most remind  me.” Not an unseasonable exordium under the circumstances. When,  some 1300 years after this event, the inhabitants of the city of Lystra  in the region of Lycaonia (Asia Minor) witnessed the apostles Paul  and Barnabas preaching and working miracles, they took them to be  gods in the likeness of men.1 Hungry too, or so they thought. So the  priest of ‘Zeus who is before the city’ supplied oxen in order to bring a  sacrifice in honour of their divine visitors,2 christening Barnabas Zeus  and Paul Hermes because the latter “was the principal speaker,” as we  read in the Acts of the Apostles. Hungry gods and deified mortals, as well as the interaction between  rhetorical praise and religious language belong to the most captivat- ing phenomena of Greek religion. They will all return in later chap- ters of this book. The present chapter will be concerned with another  theme prompted by these two charming anecdotes, namely that of  1 Acts 14.11: “The gods, having taken on human shape, have come down to us.” 2 Acts 14.13 mentions only θύειν, while 14.19 has θύειν αὐτοῖς (to sacrifice to  them). The expression πρὸ τῆς πόλεως as an epithet of gods may refer to their protec- tive nature, but more often to the location of their sanctuary outside the city, as for  instance the one of ‘Dionysos before the city’ of Ephesos, on which see: R. Merkelbach,  Die ephesischen Dionysosmysten vor der Stadt, ZPE 36 (1979) 151–156.  </page> <page sequence="2"> 24 chapter one polytheism. Not that Greeks of the archaic and classical periods used  that term to typify their own religion. It is a qualification—or rather  a disqualification—invented by Christian monotheists in order to give  expression to a conceptual antithesis.3 Their polytheistic opponents, in  their turn, stigmatized the Christians as atheoi, not as monotheoi. Though lacking appropriate conceptual terminology, the Greeks  were very much aware that they worshipped a multitude of gods.  Indeed, in the words of a modern observer, ancient Greek religion  was ‘unashamedly polytheistic’,4 to both the awe and the distress of  the mortal observers,5 ancient and modern. Homer Il. 20.4–9 describes  how an infinite number of gods come to the assembly on Olympos,  including all the rivers and all the nymphs. From a different perspec- tive, Thales (early sixth century BC) claimed that “everything is full of  gods”6 and, again in another context, his older contemporary Hesiod  Op. 252 f. claims that no fewer than 30.000 (probably meaning ‘thrice  countless’, which is very many indeed) divine assistants of Zeus are  3 “Le mot ‘polythéisme’ a été inventé par des monothéistes:” Rudhardt 1966, 355;  “Von dem Sonderfall der israelitischen Religion aus gesehen, wird (viz. in Philo)  der ‘Normalfall’ (viz. polytheistic religion) terminologisch ausgegrenzt—und nicht  umgekehrt:” Gladigow 1983, 293. Cf. Bruit-Schmitt 1992, 176. The term πολύθεος  did occur and can be found already in Aesch. Suppl. 424, describing one altar that  is shared by a plurality of gods. It was rediscovered for European tradition by Jean  Bodin in 1580. See: F. Schmidt, Naissance des polythéismes (1624–1757), ASSR 59  (1985) 77–90, espec. 77 and 88 n. 2. On the modern construction of the two notions  polytheism-monotheism and their opposition see: R. Hülsewiesche &amp; S. Loretz, Poly- theismus I, HWP 7 (1989) 1087–1093; B. Gladigow, Polytheismus.

I use the term polytheism in its accepted and non-dogmatic  designation of ‘belief in and worship of many gods’. 4 Rowe 1980, 51. I gladly adopt this fortunate expression, especially because there  also exists an ‘ashamed’ type of polytheism, namely in those monotheistic systems that  cannot resist the emergence of a plurality of divine persons. See below p. 241 ff. 5 “Gods overflowed like clothes from an over-filled drawer which no one felt  obliged to tidy,” thus one of the many pertinent statements in: Parker 2005, 387. So  many gods are not easy to memorize either. Papyri have produced quite a number of  lists of gods intended as school exercises: P. Mich. I 656, 657 (H.C. Youtie, Scriptiun- culae I [Amsterdam 1973] 467–477); O. Guéraud &amp; P. Jouquet, Publ. Soc. Fouad II,  Un livre d’écolier du IIIe siècle avant J.-C.; N.E. Priest, A list of Gods, ZPE 27 (1977)  194–200 (on bilingualism). Cf. also G. Goetz (ed.), Corpus Glossariorum Latinorum  III: Hermeneumata Pseudodositheana (Leipzig 1892).  6 Or does this go back to Xenophanes? For which see: A.V. Lebedev, A New Frag- ment of Xenophanes, in: M. Capaso et alii (edd.), Studi di filosofia preplatonica (Naples  1985) 13 ff.; G.

And, indeed, the Greek appreciation of this divine plurality was  not devoid of ambiguity. One complication was of a quite practical  nature: the speech Against Nikomachos in the corpus of Lyias, claims  that Nikomachos, charged with the job of collecting and inscribing the  sacred laws of Athens, had worked out such a long list of sacrifices that  the city would go bankrupt if it kept to the code.9 A far more burning issue inherent in plurality, as Odysseus and  the Lycaonians illustrate, is that of choice, in other words the quest  for divine identities. A corollary of this, no less exasperating, is the  question of order versus chaos. Humans—and I take this category as  including both ancient Greeks and modern scholars—generally dislike  uncertainty and doubt.10 While early Christians disqualified pagans  by stressing the disorderly and confusing plurality of their divine   7 The same number is mentioned centuries later by the Cynic Oinomaos apud  Euseb. Praep. ev. 5.36.2, with reference to the total number of idols in his time. Admit- tedly this regards collectives of anonymous gods. As far as named gods are concerned,  I doubt if the Greek pantheon can boast as many different deities as the Akkadian one,  where A. Deimel, Pantheon Babylonicum (Rome 1914) counts 3300, and K. Tallquist,  Akkadische Götterepitheta (Helsinki 1938) 2400 divine names. And compare the grand  total of 1218 gods in one inscription and 1970 divine names in AN=anum as discussed  by B. Nevling Porter, The Anxiety of Multiplicity, in: Porter 2000, 211–271.   8 As E. Bickerman noticed in AJPh 95 (1974) 369 n. 31, who also refers to an obser- vation by Petronius that the city of Cumae had more immortal than mortal inhabit- ants: idem, Anonymous Gods, JWI 1 (1937–8) 187.

Rosivach 1994, 9–67, how- ever, calculates that there must have been forty to forty five public sacrifices every year  in fourth century Athens. Since L. Deubner, Attische Feste (Berlin 1932), there is a  more recent collection of all the (dated) festivals in the Athenian calendar: J.D. Mikal- son, The Sacred and Civil Calendar of the Athenian Year (Princeton 1975). Cf. also:  R.C.T. Parker, Festivals of the Attic Demes, in: T.

We will pay  attention to one of these strategies—the hunt for oneness among the  many—in the third chapter. Another escape is to stress the element  of structure and coherence in the Greek pantheon as opposed to the  chaos that the notion of plurality inevitably evokes in the perception  of readers imbued with a monotheistic heritage. This, then, is the topic  that we will broach in the present first chapter, for it was at stake in the  most influential central debate of the second half of the last century. 1. The Greek pantheon: kosmos or chaos? With ‘most influential central debate’ I am referring to the clash between  the two outstanding champions in the study of Greek religion of the  last forty years. One is Walter Burkert, widely acclaimed as the greatest  living expert on Greek religion. The other is Jean-Pierre Vernant, initia- tor, indefatigable patron, and till his death in 2007 the eminence grise of  what is generally referred to as the École de Paris. His introduction, in  the sixties, of a structuralistic approach to the study of Greek religion— later he preferred the catchword ‘psychologie h istorique’—has hit the  field like an earthquake, generating the fathomless chasms that separate  the initiated within from the unbelievers without. All students of Greek  religion stand in debt of at least one of these two protagonists, many— including the present writer—of both.11 11 This section of the present chapter had reached its final form years before I  actually gave the Sather lectures in 1999, and I have not changed its overall shape  and content since. Many assessments of the Parisian structuralist approach (for the  expression ‘école de Paris’ see below n. 41) in comparison with a more traditionalist  approach have appeared since, for none of which I feel more sympathy than the one  by Parker 2005, 387–395, being brief, crisp, and clever in that it inconspicuously calls  in question in the next line any judgement made in the preceding one (a character- istic that I saw recently phrased in a more elegant way by V. Pirenne-Delforge in her  review of Parker’s book in Kernos 20 (2007) 428. While the reader will have to wait  for my own considerations till the end of this chapter, I warmly recommend reading  Parker’s exposition. In the meantime it may be appropriate at this point to express  my approval of E.W. Ardener, Social Anthropology and the Decline of Modernism,  in: J. Overing (ed.), Reason and Morality (London 1985), who argues that although  other disciplines may think of structuralism as postmodern, its place in anthropology  is as a thoroughly modernist phenomenon. So does in other words C. Geertz, Works  and Lives. The Anthropologist as Author (Stanford 1988) 143, when he speaks of the  “Lévi-Straussian rage for order.” </page> <page sequence="5">  many gods: complications of polytheism 27 With respect to the appreciation of Greek polytheism, one could  not possibly find two scholars more appropriate to illustrate the amaz- ing cleft between modern positions than Burkert and Vernant. For  this reason as well as—in the most honest sense of the word—honoris  causa I will now start our exposé of the implications and complica- tions of polytheism with two quotations taken from the work of these  eminent students of Greek religion. In his Inaugural Lecture to the Chair of Comparative Studies of  Ancient Religions at the Collège de France, December the 5th 1975,12  speaking about Greek polytheism, Vernant formulated what I would  call both his confession of faith and the guiding principle for the major  part of his scholarly work.13 Several items of the following definition  will merit our attention in later lectures. A god is a power that represents a type of action, a kind of force. Within  the framework of a pantheon, each of these powers is defined*14 not in  itself as an isolated object but by virtue of its relative position in the  aggregate of forces, by the structure of relations that oppose and unite it  to the other powers that constitute the divine universe. The law of this  12 It appeared as a separate publication as Religion grecque, religions antiques, in the  series Textes à l’appui (Maspéro Paris 1976), whose pagination I follow for the French  quotations, and also as an article under the title “Grèce ancienne et étude comparé des  religions” in Archives de Sciences Sociales des Religions 41 (1976) 5–24. The English  translation, ‘Inaugural Address at the Collège de France’, appeared in Social Science  Information 16 (1977) 5–24, which was reproduced in: Mortals and Immortals: Col- lected Essays, edited with an excellent introduction by Froma I. Zeitlin (Princeton  1991), 269–289, whose pagination I follow for the English quotations. 13 Hence similar enunciations return time and again, e.g. in Vernant 1980, IX: “Our  remarks on the Greek gods consider the pantheon from two points of view; first as  a divine society with its own hierarchy, in which each god enjoys his own particular  attributes and privileges, bearing a more or less close, more or less direct relation to  the structure of human society; and secondly as a classificatory system, a symbolic  language with its own intellectual ends.” See ibidem the chapter ‘The Society of the  Gods’, 92–109, espec. 106. These programmatic theoremata are adopted as a catechism  of sorts by many adherents and sympathisers as for instance Detienne 1986, 50: “Un  dieu ne saurait se définir en termes statiques, mais à travers l’ensemble des positions  qu’il peut occuper;” Bruit-Schmitt 1992, 176 ff. and 277 f.  14 I have indicated with an * the cases where I propose a translation differing from  the original one by H. Piat: “being defined” instead of “becomes distinct;” “demarca- tion” instead of “definition;” “omnipotence” instead of “all-powerful;” “infinite power”  instead of “the infinite.” The reader may compare the French original (below n. 16)  to understand why. As Paul Cartledge sighs in his preface to Bruit-Schmitt 1992, the  jargon of the Paris school (“penser le divin”) is sometimes untranslatable. Some of  these problems emerge in the present—most seminal—passage.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 28 chapter one society of the beyond is the strict demarcation* of the forces15 and their  hierarchical counterbalancing. This excludes the categories of omnipo- tence*, omniscience and of infinite power.*16 As to the question of how he can be so confident of all this,17 the  answer can be found at the preceding page of the same treatise (271 f.).  It is another confession of faith, pertaining to the profusion and diver- sity of myths, including their contradictions and disparities, which—as  Vernant sees it—debarred previous scholars from treating them as a  coherent system. A scattered and heterogeneous pantheon, a mythology of bits and pieces:  if this was the polytheism of the Greeks, how could these men, whose  exacting rigor in the realms of intellectual consistency is extolled, have  lived their religious life in a kind of chaos?18 This (rhetorical) question may, and often did come as a surprise to  those who have cognizance, if only by the title, of Dodds’ famous  book ‘The Greeks and the Irrational’. Vernant has amply elaborated  on the theme of the consistency of Greek theology in his analyses of  structural relations and oppositions between gods, most notably in his  15 It should be added that these forces, rather than by spheres of activity, are dis- tinguished by modes of action, each of which in turn may be ascribed to any god.  E.g. though most characteristic of Athena, metis (‘cunning’) in various different ways  belongs to the equipment of many other gods.  16 French original (p. 15): “Un dieu est une puissance qui traduit une forme  d’action, un type de pouvoir. Dans le cadre d’un panthéon, chacune de ces puissances  se définit, non en elle même, comme sujèt isolé, mais par sa position relative dans  l’ensemble des pouvoirs, par le système des rapports qui l’opposent et l’unissent aux  autres puissances composant l’univers divin. La loi de cette société de l’au-delà, c’est la  délimitation stricte des pouvoirs, leur équilibre hiérarchisé, ce qui exclut les catégories  de la toute-puissance, de l’omniscience, du pouvoir infini.”  17 Several components of this definition can be found in works by earlier scholars.  Very similar for example is A. Brelich, Der Polytheismus, Numen 7 (1960) 123–136,  espec. 128: “Darüber hinaus müssen die Gottheiten voneinander gut abgehoben  werden; doch, um eine Störung der Einheit der Erfahrungswelt zu vermeiden, müs- sen die Gottheiten miteinander verbunden werden und ein organisches Pantheon  bilden.” and 129: “die Vielfältigkeit von Aspekten, die Differenzierung von anderen  Gottheiten und die durch Beziehungen zu anderen Gottheiten bedingte Einfügung in  ein Pantheon.”  18 In the French original (p. 12/3): “Un panthéon dispersé, disparate, une mytholo- gie faite de pièces et de morceaux, si tel était le polythéisme des Grecs, comment ces  hommes, dont on célèbre l’exigente rigueur en matière de cohérence intellectuelle,  ont-ils pu vivre religieusement dans une sorte de chaos?” Cf. Vernant 1980, 214: “that  the same people, the same civilisation held to be the embodiment of virtues of intel- lectual clarity, rigour and order could have lived in a sort of chaos where their religion  and mythology were concerned.” </page> <page sequence="7">  many gods: complications of polytheism 29 brilliant discussion of Hermes and Hestia,19 while Detienne followed  suit with, for instance, his analysis of Athena and Poseidon.20 Both  types of relationship—similarity and opposition—embody contrary  but complementary aspects of the Greeks’ experience of space and  social relations. It is also true, however, as has been often noticed,  that in numerous cases gods seem to duck out of the system or are  forced into it.21 We will return to this in later chapters. All the same,  Vernant never renounced his conviction that “the polytheistic system  is a rigorously logical ensemble, designed for the purpose of classifying  divine capacities and powers” (my italics). ‘Pantheon’, ‘system’, ‘struc- ture’: the terminology itself suggests coherence, correlation, transpar- ency.22 If we were asked to summarize Vernant’s views on the Greek  pantheon in one word, the term ‘structure’ (or Greek kosmos) would  be a good candidate. In his ‘confession of faith’, to be found in Griechische Religion der  archaischen und klassischen Epoche, published two years after Ver- nant’s inaugural address, in 1977, Walter Burkert presents his assess- ment of Greek polytheism:23 19 Vernant, 1971. ‘Brilliant’ does not imply that there is nothing to criticise, for  which see Ch. IV. 20 M. Detienne, La corneille de mer, in: M. Detienne &amp; J.-P. Vernant, Les ruses de  l’intelligence. La mètis des Grecs (Paris 1974) 203–243. English translation in: idem,  Cunning Intelligence in Greek Culture and Society (Hassocks, Sussex 1974) 215–258;  ‘The Sea-Crow’, in: Gordon 1981, 16–42. And cf. his analyses of oppositions and simi- larities between Athena and Hephaistos, ibid. 169–260.  21 So let me hasten to add that the Greek pantheon as viewed by the Paris team,  though conceived as “a system of classification, a particular way of ordering and con- ceptualising the universe” (Vernant 1980, 94), never was a “static system of polarities,”  but consisted of “overlapping sets of dynamic interrelations, complex transformations  and shifting tensions, viewed in the context of history, social institutions, ritual and  political life:” thus C.P. Segal, Afterword: J.-P. Vernant and the Study of Ancient  Greece, Arethusa 15 (1982) 221–234, espec. 232. 22 It should be noted in passing, that, like polytheism, the term ‘pantheon’ was  definitely not a fixed notion in Greek religious idiom, least of all in our sense of  ‘divine society’. On the contrary, whenever Greeks introduced collective notions such  as pantes theoi, these refer to lack of contours rather than to an organic and transpar- ent system, as we shall see below. 23 I quote from the English version, Greek Religion: Archaic and Classical (trans- lated by J. Raffan, Oxford 1985) 119. The German original runs: “Nun ist jedoch eine  polytheistische Götterwelt nicht nur für den Aussenstehenden potentiell chaotisch.  Die Individualität eines Gottes, durch die er von anderen sich unterscheidet, wird  durch mindestens viererlei constituiert und vermittelt: den nach Ort und Zeit fix- ierten Kult mit seinem Ritualprogramm und der darüber liegenden Stimmung; den  Namen; die über den so benannten erzählten Mythen; die Ikonographie, insbesondere  </page> <page sequence="8"> 30 chapter one But a polytheistic world of gods is nevertheless potentially chaotic, and  not only for the outsider. The distinctive personality of a god is consti- tuted and mediated by at least four different factors: the established local  cult with its ritual programme and unique atmosphere, the divine name,  the myths told about the named being, and the iconography, especially  the cult image. All the same, this complex is easily dissolved, and this  makes it quite impossible to write the history of any single god.24 Clearly, this picture fits perfectly Vernant’s derisive evocation of “a  scattered and heterogeneous pantheon,” in short, a chaos. Here, then,  we encounter two radically different and on the face of it incompatible  views of Greek polytheism, differing in practically every respect, both  as to content and type of argumentation, most conspicuously in the  antithesis between what I have called kosmos and chaos. Significantly, the only conviction which the two scholars do share,  namely the idea that it is impossible to adequately define one single god  in isolation from others, precisely reveals the gulf by which they are  separated. Vernant explains this aporia by his conviction that no god  exists (hence: can be described) in isolation from other gods. Together  the gods construct, as we have seen, “the polytheistic system as a rigor- ously logical ensemble, designed for the purpose of classifying divine  capacities and powers.” Burkert, in his definition, avoids these terms,  and gives a radically different reason for his inability of fully describing  one god in isolation: each god as an individual is defined by a number  of characteristics, dependent on variations in time and place. These  characteristics, however, are variables associated in untransparent and  seemingly arbitrary shifts with a great number of other gods. While for  Vernant the coexistence and relationships of gods are the conditio sine  qua non for an individuation of each god, for Burkert the very same  pluralist variety of gods and their transformations constitute the germs  of the potentially chaotic nature of Greek polytheism. Both scholars, of course, are very much aware of and have from  time to time alluded to their differences of opinion. When Vernant  asserts that “it is these structures of the pantheon that are the sub- ject of research, not the deities in isolation,” he does so in the con- text of a forthright rejection of Burkert’s more evolutionary ‘historical  das Kultbild. Dieser Komplex indessen ist keineswegs unauflöslich; dies macht es prin- zipiell unmöglich, ‘die’ Geschichte eines bestimmten Gottes zu schreiben.”  24 Cf. Parker 2005, 394: “A comprehensive study of Greece is an impossible deal.” </page> <page sequence="9">  many gods: complications of polytheism 31 positivist’25 approach to Greek religion. After all, the Burkertian  approach necessarily results in a pantheon (that) could not fail to appear as a mere conglomeration of  gods, an assemblage of unusual personages of diverse origin, the prod- ucts, in random circumstances, of fusion, assimilation, and segmenta- tion. They seem to find themselves in association rather by virtue of  accidents of history than by the inherent requirements of an organized  system, demonstrating on the intellectual level the need for classification  and organization, and satisfying exact functional purposes on the social  level.26 Revealingly, what is meant as a crushing criticism by the critic is pre- cisely what the target would appreciate as a not totally incorrect sum- mary of his central thesis.27 Likewise, Burkert’s response28 involves a  point-blank confrontation with the structuralistic catechism of  Vernant  by pointing out: The danger in this approach is, of course, that the historically given real- ity will perforce be curtailed for the sake of the system and its logical  structure. Such relationships are good for thinking, but reality does not  always follow suit; a certain stubbornness of the facts remains. Just as the  Greek mind does not exist as a unified and definable structure, so the  25 ‘Historical positivism’ is precisely what Vernant 1980, 212 ff. denounces in   Nilsson, whose “purpose is to reveal the fundamentally composite, syncretic, hetero- geneous nature of classical religion, which is regarded not as an organised whole but  as a collection of gods associated together more as the result of historical chance than  through any internal logic.” And he speaks of: “A gallery of disparate portraits . . .  disjointed perspective . . . little relation to each other. . . . elements of different origins  which happen by chance to have come together.”  26 Cf. also M. Detienne, Expérimenter dans le champ des polythéismes, Kernos  10 (1997) 57–72, who presents a thoughtful re-consideration of the structuralistic  approach to Greek polytheism, and of his own position in it, with emphatic recogni- tion of Dumézil’s earlier contributions. 27 Burkert himself in his ‘Schlusswort’ to his Festschrift (Graf 1998) 442, after first  signalizing modern (not least French) modes of ‘erfinden’ or ‘constructing’ Greek  religion, continues: “Mein Eindruck war immer der, daß es nicht um eine Erfind- ung gehe, sondern um ein Finden.” Deduction versus induction, one might say. This  personal stance is further elucidated in a retrospective reflection on his own work:  W. Burkert, ‘Mythos und Ritual’ im Wechsel der Moderne, in: Horstmanshoff 2002,  1–22. As for instance (p. 14): “Ich straübe mich eher gegen die Destruktion des Objek- tiven und möchte insbesondere die kritische Auflösung der Begriffe Mythos und Ritual,  die etwa Marcel Detienne und Claude Calame eingeleitet haben, nicht mitmachen.” 28 Burkert 1985, 217. And see especially the provocative first chapter of his Sather  lectures (Burkert 1979) 1–34, espec. 10–14, in which he forcefully censures the essen- tially a-historic and static nature of Levi-Straussian structuralism (which is not neces- sarily the same structuralism as that of the Paris school).  </page> <page sequence="10"> 32 chapter one Greek pantheon cannot be regarded as a closed and harmonized system.  Even if the system could be described specifically for each place and time  and even for each individual, it would still remain unstable and full of  gaps, in the same way that the experience of each individual, in spite of  all striving for wholeness, remains disparate and heterogeneous. Accordingly, like their views on the impossibility to adequately define  one single god in isolation, so, too, their assessments of ‘divergences,  disparities, and contradictions’ (Vernant 1980, 271), radically diverge.  Vernant, in whose view the polytheistic pantheon is a product and  reflection of contemporaneous socio-political structures and the con- comitant mental categories, warns against fatalistically putting them  down to pure accident or the whims of individual fancy. Rather we  should consider “whether as part of an ordained arrangement, they  may be as meaningful as congruities and accordances.”29 Contrarily,  Burkert, who views early Greek religion as an amalgam of Mycenaean  relics, novel influences from changing social circumstances in Greece,  and last but not least a strong cultural influx of Near- Eastern ele- ments, is not prone to regarding inconsistencies as reflexions of cul- tural, social of mental constructions, let alone as a “vital intellectual  product, possessing its own logic.”30 Rather, in his view, they are the  result of historical processes and multifarious influences from different  directions: “This semiotic system is neither closed nor free of contra- diction, especially as local cult traditions again and again obtrude their  influence.”31 This seminal difference in the assessment of  contradiction,  29 Although it is not my intention at this stage to pass judgement on, or pronounce  a preference for, one of the two opponents, I cannot conceal that my own two books  on Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion (Versnel 1990 and 1993) are based  on precisely this principle. My treatment of ambiguities and contradictions, however,  generally differs from that of the Paris school.  30 Bruit-Schmitt 1992, 185. 31 Burkert 1985, 124. In his only survey of Greek religion, viz. his entry ‘Greek Reli- gion’, in: ER vol. V (1987) 99–118, espec. 103 (= Vernant 1990, 42), Vernant could not  smooth over this potential obtrusion by local traditions: “To be sure a Greek god is  defined by the set of relationships that unite or put him in opposition to other divini- ties of the pantheon, but the theological structures brought to light are too numerous  and, especially, too diverse to be integrated into the same pattern. According to the  city, the sanctuary, or the moment, each god enters into a varied network of combina- tions with the others. Groups of gods do not conform to a single model that is more  important than others; they are organized into a plurality of configurations that do  not correspond exactly but compose a table with several entries and many axes, the  reading of which varies according to the starting point and the perspective adopted.”  There seems to be little awareness that this threatens to undermine the neat system of  the Greek pantheon as vindicated in his ‘confession of faith’ quoted above.  </page> <page sequence="11">  many gods: complications of polytheism 33  inconsistency and disparity, which we shall encounter again in Chapter  IV, is probably the most revealing expression of the different positions  in terms of oppositions between the structural and the contingent, the  designed and the arbitrary, the topical and the evolutionary. In sum,  kosmos versus chaos. What we have seen so far must suffice to give a rough idea of the  crucial issues of this titanic late-modern debate. On one side there is  a great thinker: “Vernant is constantly thinking, and as he thinks he  writes,” thus one admirer.32 Another, no less sympathizing commen- tator points out “some of the mirroring, even mimetic, effects that  account for the intimate relationship between the observer—here:  Vernant—and the observed.”33 Consequently, it is sometimes honestly  conceded that he more or less imposes his ideas about the Greeks on  the material he is working on: “he does not collect evidence in order  to make a case but rather cites the material in order to illustrate his  ideas,”34 thus constructing rather than reconstructing an archaic and  classical Greece that belongs to Vernant. On the other side there is the greatest living authority on Greek  religion, who, though equally striving to become one with his material,  starts from the opposite point of departure to reach the ideal state of  henosis: In particular a god cannot be constructed to fill a gap; one must come to  know him, he must reveal himself, and so all kinds of contingent factors  come into play. The language of polytheism can only be learned pas- sively, as it were; it is impossible to have an active command of it. What  is present at hand may be interpreted, but postulates of a grammar can  scarcely be sustained.35 32 J. Redfield, J.-P. Vernant, Structure and History, History of Religions 68 (1991)  69–74, espec. 70. 33 Zeitlin 1991, 10, aptly pointing out the danger that “the modes of inquiry are  enmeshed in the very system they aim to explicate,” referring to R.P. Harrison, The  Ambiguities of Philology, Diacritics 16 (1986) 14–20.  34 Redfield o.c. (above n. 32), 70. Or one example of a less sympathising phras- ing: Naerebout 1997, 305: “Thus I see in the French Structuralist efforts in the field  of ancient thought examples of order imposed instead of order discovered. (. . .) I see  clever, but in the end unfounded attempts to turn a lot of scattered material into a  single, coherent whole.” 35 Burkert 1985, 218. </page> <page sequence="12"> 34 chapter one In a lecture given at Oxford the great von Wilamowitz once said: “To  make the ancients speak, we must feed them with our own blood.”36  Is not this reciprocity between the researcher and his material char- acteristic of both scholars under discussion, despite their basic dif- ferences? And would not both of them nod in approval at Steiner’s  words: “the truly great scholar becomes as one with his material. (. . . .)  It will become his without ceasing to be itself ”?37 The startling—and  fascinating—result, however, is that two eminent scholars, while both  intensely identifying themselves with their object of study, yet arrive at  (or depart from?) radically opposite insights concerning the morphol- ogy of polytheism.38 It is not my aim to analyse the differences in cultural and intel- lectual backgrounds, if not belief systems, that may have fostered this  opposition between the scholarly approaches of these two intellec- tual icons.39 I did feel, however, that at least one lecture of this last  Sather series of the twentieth century might draw attention to this  debate. Moreover, this particular dispute excelled in the explicit clarity  of argument and counter argument. We must realize, however, that  36 H. Lloyd-Jones, Blood for the Ghosts: Classical Influences in the Nineteenth and  Twentieth Centuries (London 1982) 200. The idea goes back to Nietzsche: “It is only  if we give them our soul, that [the works of earlier times] can go on living: it is our  blood that makes them speak to us” (Assorted Opinions and Maxims 126 in: Human  all too Human).  37 “The Friend of a Friend,” New Yorker (January 23, 1990) 133–136, as quoted  by Zeitlin 1991, 10. Or in the words of the dust cover of R. MacMullen, Feelings in  History, Ancient and Modern (Claremont Cal. 2003): “to read with empathy.” All this  comes close to what H.-G. Gadamer, Truth and Method (translation of Wahrheit und  Methode, London 1981) 358, in the wake of Dilthey calls: “’fusing’ one’s own ‘horizon’  of understanding with the horizon of the author.” But his sense of ‘truth’ is quite dif- ferent from the ideal of correctly representing what the text meant to the author or  his audience (cf. Ch. II n. 103). 38 The demand to develop a ‘morphology of polytheism’ was expressed by Brelich  as quoted by Gladigow 1983, 292. 39 I cannot withhold though that a great admirer of Vernant, F. Zeitlin 1991, 8,  situates Vernant in the typically French cultural tradition marked by a penchant for  “reason, logic and exacting analysis,” and “a certain passion for order, system, and  intelligibility.” Moreover, “there is the insistence on the triadic form of argument with  a beginning, middle and end or the division of a problem into three parts: in short  ‘structure’” (ibid. 9) resulting in a “meeting of minds when French culture encounters  the Hellenic world.” See on the differences between French, German (and English)  manners of exposition in scholarly discourse: P.

Most amusing. </page> <page sequence="13">  many gods: complications of polytheism 35 when we ask whether the Greek pantheon was chaos or kosmos, this  does not mean that the two terms should be necessarily conceived in  Vernantian or Burkertian terms. As a matter of fact, the dispute on  this question pervades all relevant scholarly discussion and no student  can ignore its impact or refrain from reflection and the question of  choice. This appears most conspicuously in the textbooks on Greek  Religion that mushroomed over the last fifteen years. A comparison  between the very Parisian Religion in the Ancient Greek City by Bruit- Zaidman and Schmitt-Pantel with Burkert’s own Greek Religion is  indeed illuminating. As for the treatment of the gods, for instance,  Burkert adopts the traditional custom of systematically devoting sepa- rate treatments to each of the Olympian gods, one after the other.  Those Gallic and Gallicizing authors, on the other hand, who follow  in the track of the Paris school and hence feel committed to its creed  that this is blasphemy, necessarily opt for a different organisation of  their books. This principle is now widely accepted, also by scholars of  a different  denomination.40 I compared here a book of disciples, or at least adherents, with  one of a protagonist. The reason is that, different from the ‘Ecole de  Paris’,41 one cannot speak of a ‘school’ of Burkert, inter alia because his  scholarly activities display an impressive diversity and his theoretical  points of departure cannot be captured under one catchword. Scholars  have followed in his tracks but mostly on issues different from the one  40 E.g. in: Price 1999; V. Pirenne-Delforge, ‘Religion grecque’, in: Y. Lehmann et  alii, Religions de l’Antiquité (Paris 1999) 78–175. Also in the works of Jost and Mikal- son mentioned in the text. Cf. Bremmer 1994, 11: “Gods have not been at the very  centre of modern discussion of Greek religion,” who in his turn gives the gods their  due in his first chapter (and see his addenda in the second printing 1999, 102 n. 2).  It is exactly at this point that the most pointed critical review of Burkert’s handbook,  namely B. Gladigow in GGA 235 (1983) 16, takes its starting point: “Eine polytheis- tische Religion durch einen Katalog von Göttern zu beschreiben, oder als Interpreta- tionssystem vorzuführen, sind weitauseinanderliegende Ansätze, deren Zugriffsweisen  je andere Gegenstände hervorrufen. Was sind also die Gegenstände dieser griechi- schen Religionsgeschichte, welches ist der methodische Zugang,- und welche Alter- nativen gibt es?”  41 This much used sobriquet may be “quelque peu réductrice” when applied to  the post-Vernantian line of ‘Parisian’ research, as rightly noted by St. Georgoudi in:  Georgoudi e.a. 2005, 115, n. 1, whose contribution to that volume is the most illustra- tive testimony of the radical changes. In E. Thomassen 2004, 283, Georgoudi herself  had already referred to her latest publication as “an auto-critique, from the begin- ning to the end.” Like others, e.g. Thomassen ibidem, I use the term ‘Paris School’  vel similia as a catchword for the works of Vernant, Detienne and Vidal-Naquet and  their closest adherents. </page> <page sequence="14"> 36 chapter one under discussion. In the question of ‘chaos versus cosmos’ in polythe- ism, instead of direct influence one rather observes a convergence of  related viewpoints among scholars. Many of them will come to the fore  in the course of this chapter. I here single out M. Jost, Aspects de la vie  religieuse en Grèce (Paris 1992) and J.D. Mikalson, Ancient Greek Reli- gion (Malden MA 2005) since in their first chapters they open—very  similar—perspectives on polytheism, divine identities, and distinc- tions between national and local pantheons42 that may be regarded as  neat oppositions to the structuralist schemes as defended by the Paris  equipe. Others, of course, have continued following their own tracks,43  as do more and more scholars in recent times taking their departure  from novel insights in theory and method in religious studies. Some  of them explicitly or implicitly refuse to choose between the views of  Burkert and Vernant.44 I myself have been interested in related themes  from the seventies of the last century onwards, boring my students to  death with the questions, problems and suggestions that the Sather  Lectures gave me the opportunity to expand on in more detail. The Greek pantheon: order or chaos? Is this a correct question when  approaching Greek religion? Perhaps not, but to find out we must now  leave theoretical discussions and go ad fontes. 42 Mikalson rather briefly, but he had frequently hinted at the problems in earlier  works. His book is composed in a fashion similar to that of Jost, a book that, to judge  from his bibliographical references, has escaped his attention. I will return to their  and others’ viewpoints.  43 With regard to the issue of polytheism I mention in particular B. Gladigow in a  range of insightful articles as listed in the bibliography, and Rowe 1976, who antici- pated many later students including the present writer in his fresh views on polythe- istic (and, as we will discuss in Chapter III, monotheistic) trends in Greek religion,  focusing as he writes on “the contrast between the relatively unified picture of the  Greek pantheon in the literary tradition espec. Homer and Hesiod, and the extreme  variety of the objects of Greek piety at the level of cult-practice.” For an illuminating  survey of the history of local versus global studies of Greek religion see: G. Casadio,  Local versus globale nello studio della religione greca, in: D. Giacometti (ed.), META- PONTO. Gli dei e gli eroi nella storia di una polis di Magna Grecia (Cosenza 2005)  241–271. 44 As I did in my earlier work, especially TER UNUS, introduction. For explicit  enunciations see e.g. Bremmer 1994, 23: “It would be wrong to choose between the  views of Burkert and Vernant,” with brief discussion (unfortunately in the context of  his own distinction between ‘orderly’ and ‘disorderly’ gods, which, in my view, is not  successful.

In search of identities Recognizing a god: who is who? Let us first return to the problems with which Odysseus and the inhab- itants of Lystra saw themselves confronted. They offer an exemplary  introduction to the complexities of polytheism. Appearing gods, espe- cially when they manifest themselves in the shape of a mortal being,45  provoke problems of identification. Naturally so. But ancient Greek  epiphany reports never stop further complicating the issue. They may  stage the personal appearance of a god in his own shape, or in the  form of his cult statue, or in the shape of a human person, or in that  of an animal. Or the manifestation may lack the element of normal  corporeal appearance and take the form of vague images such as phas- mata, eidola, phantasiai.46 Or, again, what is perceived is no visible  bodily manifestation at all, but only a miracle, for instance a sudden  miraculous cure or natural marvel, which nonetheless may be inter- preted as a testimony of the presence of a god.47 Given the plethora of divine identities, the human subject must  decide, and may do so in different ways. Generally, divine apparitions  in dreams do not raise serious problems of identification. Even mod- ern dreamers know that the life-size white rabbit appearing in their  dream is actually uncle Harry because the dream is subtitled. Visions  perceived in a waking situation may provide comparable clues. For  instance, visitors to a centre of pilgrimage know that the supernatural  45 As they often do. In Hom. Od. 17.484 ff. the suitors warn Antinoos not to mal- treat the stranger: “Suppose he is a god, descended from heaven! For gods in guise  of strangers from afar in every form do roam our cities, marking the sin and righ- teousness of men.” Cf. Apollo and Poseidon in Il. 21.443 ff.; 7.452 f. Also Il. 24.29 f.  B.C. Dietrich, Divine Epiphanies in Homer, Numen 30 (l983) 53–79, takes Homeric  epiphanies as a literary device with no appreciable relationship with religious reality.  Contrarily, O. Tsagarakis, Die Epiphanie Athenes im A. der Ilias: Psychologie oder  Religion? Gymnasium 87 (1980) 57–80, forcefully (and in my view far more convinc- ingly) defends the religious impact of Athena’s epiphany. On gods visiting mortals in  human form: Weniger 1923–4, 16–57; Flückiger-Guggenheim 1984. On the question:  god or man? see: Pfister 1924, 312 ff. 46 A survey of different forms of appearance in Versnel 1987.  47 On the question whether all these different types of manifestation were referred  to as epiphaneiai in Greek language: H.S. Versnel, Epiphaneia. A Study in Perception  (in preparation). </page> <page sequence="16"> 38 chapter one materialization appearing to them, whether recognizable or not, must  be the local god or saint.48 The believer sees what he expects to see.49 Generally, in the case of epiphany, the question is not whether the  person you see is a god—you know (s)he is50—but which god it is  you see. Odysseus’ words exemplarily reveal the problem: “Hard is it,  goddess, for a mortal man to know you when he meets you (. . .) for  you take whatever shape you will” (Od. 13.311 ff.). Much the same in  a more or less gnomic expression in H.Dem. 111: “difficult to see are  gods for mortals” (χαλεποὶ δὲ θεοὶ θνητοῖσι ὁρᾶσθαι).51 True enough,  gods in epiphany may appear in a clearly recognizable characteristic  shape.52 Moreover, in literature the author—as most exemplarily again  Homer—often lends a hand, for instance by prompting the gods them- selves to establish their identities, or by furnishing them with their  attributes. Not always, however. Odysseus had as little idea about the  identity of the (river-)god to whom he prayed for help (whom the  reader had no way of identifying either) as his son Telemachos knew  48 Just so, when a temple or a city is rescued from an enemy attack or other perils  through a divine epiphany, as a rule there is little doubt that it is the god of the temple  or the tutelary god of the city who performed the salvation. Most illuminative are the  inscriptions mentioning epiphaneiai as collected and discussed in H.S. Versnel, o.c.  preceding note. 49 In votive pictures portraying the appearance of the holy Virgin (and her saving  miracle) pinned on the walls of a centre of pilgrimage, usually this holy Virgin has all  the features of the main cult statue of the church. See: M. Brauneck, Religiöse Volks- kunst (Köln 1978); R. Creux, Ex voto. Die Bilderwelt des Volkes (Frauenfeld 1980). Cf.  also the discussion below n. 167. On typical phenomena as ‘make believe’ and ‘seeing  what one expects to see’ I found very helpful: J. Runzo, Visions, Pictures and Rules,  Religious Studies 13 (1977) 303–325. 50 Usually, gods in epiphany betray themselves as gods—though not necessarily as  specific gods—by a range of signals: beauty, lustrous radiance, flagrance, size, sound  of voice, the way they move, the miracles they perform etc. Telemachos assumes that  the poor foreigner (whom he does not yet recognize as his father) actually was a god  all the time, but came to this insight only after Athena had given the stranger a reju- venating cure and new outfit (Od. 16.181–185). See: Pfister l924, 314–317; Pax, l955,  30; Mussies 1988, 4–7; Gladigow 1990a, 97–101. On equation of size and beauty: W.J.  Verdenius, ƍΑΛΛƒƕ ƍΑƌ ΜƈƆƈΘƒƕ, Mnemosyne 2 (1949) 294–298. 51 The context clarifies that it is about recognizing the old women not as a goddess  but as goddess Demeter. See: Richardson comm. ad. loc. and 94 ff. Comparable, but dif- ferent in its distinction between people who do see the goddess (Odysseus) and those  who do not (Telemachos): Hom. Od. 16.161, οὐ γάρ πως πάντεσσι θεοὶ φαίνονται  ἐναργεῖς. In Hom Il. 1.194 Athena makes herself visible to Achilles alone. Many paral- lels in A.S.

Such expressions  of theological suspension resound throughout antiquity. Not even the  new monotheistic religion could get round them: Paul had no idea  whom he saw or heard—or saw and heard—in his vision on the way  to Damascus. So he asked “Who are you, Lord?” and received the  required information (with world-shattering consequences).55 But when you see a putatively divine person in human (or other)  guise you may also take another course of action. Even if we admit that  Odysseus’ surmise concerning the divine status of the girl may have  been inspired by hunger and the wish to alleviate it,56 still the rhetoric  53 F.

Bannert, Zur Vogelgestalt der Götter bei Homer, WS 12 (1978) 29–42. 54 Just as in Il. 13.59–72 Aiax is sure that it was one of the Olympians who visited  him in the appearance of Kalchas—ἀρίγνωτοι δὲ θεοί περ—, but has no idea that it  is Poseidon. 55 As Acts 9.3–9; 22.6–11 and 26.12–16 provide divergent versions of the story,  miracles of ingenuity have been produced in (unsuccessful) attempts to reconcile  them. Even after survey studies as e.g. by E. Pfaff, Die Bekehrung des H.Paulus in der  Exegese des 20 Jhdts (Rome 1942); G. Lohfink, Paulus vor Damaskus. Arbeitsweisen  der neueren Bibelwissenschaft dargestellt an den Texten Apg 9, 1–19; 22, 3–21, 26, 9–18  (Stuttgart 1942), the discussion never ended. See: Versnel 1987, 42 f. More recently:  G. Schneider, Die Apostelgeschichte II (Freiburg 1982) with ample literature at pp. 19  f., who refers to the commentaries by Conzelmann and Haenchen. See also: F.E.

Bremmer, Close Encounters of the Third Kind: Heliodorus in the  Temple and Paul on the Road to Damascus, in: idem 2008, 215–234. 56 Flattering language to win over the addressee? Quite possible. Note that at Od.  6.276–281 Nausikaa seems to pay Oysseus with his own coin by the courteous sug- gestion that people may consider him to be a god. But, on the other hand, note that  in H. Apollo 449 ff. the very same occurs, and in very similar terms (“You are noth- ing like mortal men in shape or stature, but as the deathless gods”), but there the  reader (not the speaker) knows it is a god who has assumed a human appearance.  Again the same, but in a more ambiguous situation, as becomes an ambiguous god,  in H. Dionysos 1–31, where the dilemma grows into a debate: is he or isn’t he a god,  and if he is, which one: Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon? Again differently, in H.Aphrodite  91 ff., where Aphrodite having adopted human countenance is addressed by Anchises:  “Hail Lady, whoever of the blessed ones you are that are come to our house, whether  Artemis, or Leto, or golden Aphrodite, or high-born Themis, or bright-eyed Athene  (or one of the Graces or Nymphs),” and where Aphrodite emphatically denies that  she is a goddess. See especially: J. Strauss Clay 1989, 174: “Does he really believe he  has encountered a god or is he employing “prudent flattery” or “adopting the same  diplomatic attitude Odysseus used to address Nausikaa,” quoting P.M. Smith, Nursling  </page> <page sequence="18"> 40 chapter one of persuasion could not sidestep—rather indeed gladly exploited—the  problem of identity. Odysseus selected shape and features as param- eters for identification. The Lycaonians, equally in the dark about the  identity of their two divine visitors, resorted to circumstantial evidence  such as profession, function and quality to go by for their identifica- tion and defined the two apostles as Zeus and Hermes accordingly.  The runner Pheidippides—running through Arcadia in the heat of the  day (something not to be recommended)57—was pounced upon by a  mysterious being (Hdt. 6.105).58 Even if the god would not have made  himself known—as he did in a later phase—the runner knew it was  Pan, because this was simply the way Pan59—or the Midday Demon60  or Ephialtes61—used to behave.

Faulkner, The  Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite: Introduction, Text, and Commentary (Oxford 2008) 173  f. It would be wrong not to keep in mind while reading the Nausikaa passage that to  the Greek it just might end up with the proclamation: “I am a god”, as in H.Dionysos  55 ff. Yet the opposite reaction may occur as well: “We are no more than men; of  the same nature as yourselves,” shouted Paul and Barnabas (Acts 14.15); “I am not a  god . . . I am your father,” says Odysseus to Telemachos (Od. 16.187 f.), both of them  honestly. “I am not a goddess (. . .) but a mortal,” says Aphrodite (vv. 107–8) dishon- estly. A.L.T. Bergren, The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite: Tradition and Rhetoric, Praise  and Blame, ClAnt 8 (1989) 1–41, espec. 41: “the Hymn is unequivocal in this element  of its aetiology, its proclamation that any virgin bride might be Aphrodite in disguise,  and that no man ‘seized by eros’ for the bride can possibly know the difference” may  go a bit far.

In order to do so one must possess a minimal amount  of knowledge or expertise. One must know that as a rule Artemis is  represented as a youthful unmarried maiden, that according to myth  Hermes was the messenger of the gods, that Pan likes to bounce upon  people, or you must be aware that you are situated in the sanctuary of  a healing (and appearing) god. Even so, one can shamefully miss the  mark. Try and guess which is the god (not identified by helpful para- phernalia63 or epigraphic comment) who is depicted in a vase paint- ing or is represented by a statue and see how often you are wrong,  simply because your (or our) knowledge of mythical or cultic context  is insufficient and the imagery unspecific.64 Not only for the modern  observer. For Greeks, too,65 it was not always “obvious who it is” as we  read on a bowl with a relief of Herakles and Auge.66 62 See Ch. V for evidence and literature.  63 However, divine attributes are no reliable identifiers either, due to their poly- valence. See: H.

Stewart, When is a Kouros not an Apollo? The Tenea  ‘Apollo’ Revisited, in: M.A. del Chiaro (ed.), Corinthiaca: Studies in Honor of Darrell  A. Amyx (New York 1986) 54–70; N.

Hind, The  inscriptions  </page> <page sequence="20"> 42 chapter one Hence, in situations of an epiphany, Greeks tended to sidestep the  precarious problem of choice in order to avoid error or out of sheer  desperation. One solution, as we saw, was just to address the unknown  god as “Sire” or “Lady.” Another, only attested in literary works, was  to explicitly display that there is a choice, without, however, mak- ing an attempt at solving it. As, for instance, Anchises67 did when he  addressed Aphrodite as follows: “are you perhaps Artemis, or Leto,  or golden Aphrodite, or high-born Themis, or bright-eyed Athene (or  one of the Graces or Nymphs)?” a listing scheme that we shall encoun- ter in quite different contexts as a privileged strategy of polytheism. In the case of the Zeus and Hermes of the Lycaonians, we can prac- tically prove that the author of Acts (or Paul himself)68 inserted his  own—mistaken69—interpretation of the locals’ preference for Zeus  and Hermes. The Lycaonian gods going under those names were not  the well-known Olympian deities with their well-known functions of  king and messenger of the gods. They were a regionally very popu- lar, non-Greek, divine couple, with different functions, who were later  identified with these Greek gods.70 The same couple is also reported as  having visited—and been hosted by—old Philemon and Baucis in the  very same region.71 Apparently these gods had a bent for appearing to  on the silver phialai and jug from Rogozen, in: B.F. Cook (ed.), The Rogozen Treasure  (London 1989) 38–43. Asemoi andriantes, being statues without a distinct character,  both those without an easily recognizable appearance and those without specific attri- butes, formed a special category already for the Greeks themselves: Mylonopoulos  2010, 172 f. 67 Above n. 56. 68 The latter might be the case if Paul in the letter to the Galatians 4.14, with  the expression “you received me as the messenger of God” (ἀλλ’ ὡς ἄγγελος Θεο˃  ἐδέξασθέ με) referred to his reception as Hermes, which is the more likely since this  is the only time he refers to himself in these terms. 69 Probably deliberately mistaken. On possible motives for the author’s emphasis on  the specific functions of Greek Zeus and Hermes see: C. Breytenbach, Zeus und der  lebendige Gott: Anmerkungen zu Apostelgeschichte 14.11–17, NTS 39 (1993) 396–413;  L. Martin, Gods or Ambassadors of God? Barnabas and Paul in Lystra, NTS 41 (1995)  152–156. Lane Fox 1986, 99 ff., however, had already forcefully—and delightfully— argued for the authenticity of this “scene, the delight of Raphael.” 70 H. Elton, Romanization and Some Cilician Cults, in L. de Ligt, E.A. Hemelrijk &amp;  H.W. Singor (edd.), Roman Rule and Civic Life: Local and Regional Perspectives,  (Amsterdam 2004) 231–241, once more argues for the continuity of local religious  practices and beliefs in the combination of Zeus and Hermes in their Hellenized  forms. 71 Ov.

It is for that reason—and not on account of  their respective Greek mythical specialism—that the Lykaonians iden- tified Paul and Barnabas with these gods. Two Zeuses, two Hermeses: in either case we see one name accom- modating two very different characters. Is this nothing but the result of  the process generally referred to as ‘syncretism’? Before we tackle this  and related questions in more detail we will first discuss some further  complications concerning divine identities in a polytheistic context. Which god must I pray to, to which bring sacrifice? Given the confusion and lack of precision on the point of identities of  appearing gods, we should not be surprised that polytheistic Greeks  (and Romans) might find themselves equally at a loss whenever it  came to a related but different issue of choice,72 namely the question  to whom they should pray or sacrifice in order to secure divine sup- port or advice. An allegedly transparent structure of the pantheon with  a neat specialization among the major gods or powers did not, modern  theory notwithstanding, appear very helpful in guiding human beings  who were in doubt. This is quite natural and indeed unavoidable in  situations of disaster where the sufferer may wonder: “Which god did  we offend, that we are suffering this?”73 A religious offence committed  L. Malten, Motivgeschichtliche Untersuchungen zur Sagengeschichte I, Hermes 74  (1939) 176–206; II, Hermes 75 (1940) 168–176, with full discussion of parallels to the  motifs of theoxenia. Both F. Bömer, P. Ovidius Naso, Metamorphoses, Kommentar  VIII–IX (Heidelberg 1977) 190–195, and A.S. Hollis, Ovid: Metamorphoses Book VIII  (Cambridge 1970) 106 ff. lean heavily on Malten’s work, the first especially focus- ing on a possible Biblical-Semitic background, the latter with more attention to local  Phrygian influences. Essential is that an inscription from the vicinity of Lystra relating  to a joint worship of Zeus and Hermes (W.M. Calder, CR 24 [1910] 76 ff.) added to  others (Malten II, 1940, 168–171) testifies to a joint cult of two Anatolian gods “mas- querading in Greek dress” (Hollis). Most relevant is that these gods are not hierarchi- cally differentiated (Zeus Bronton, Zeus Helios side by side with Hermes megistos!).  As always it was Louis Robert, Hellenica XIII, 29, who in a summary of the evidence  added the most decisive datum: “Mais l’essentiel n’est-il pas un document vu à Lystra  (!) par Buckler and Calder, statuette de l’époque impériale représentant Hermes avec  l’aigle.” All this provides a better explanation for their identification with Paul and  Barnabas than the fact that Paul was more “loquacious” (Hollis 108). So, correctly, the  major biblical commentators, e.g. H. Conzelmann, Die Apostelgeschichte (Tübingen  1963) 87 f.; J. Zmijewski, Die Apostelgeschichte (Regensburg 1984) 535 f.

Thus one finds the inhabitants of Dodona  consulting their oracle: “Is it because of some human’s impurity that  we are suffering from this storm?” (SEG 19.427; Lhôte, no. 14). Private  individuals ask “which gods (τίνας θεῶν) am I to appease to fare bet- ter?” (P.267 no. 12; Lhôte no. 65)74 or “to which god must I sacrifice and  which god must I appease to become healthier as to my eyes?” (P.267  no. 14; Lhôte no. 72).75 The verb ἱλασκέσθαι, ‘to appease a wrath- ful god’, occurs in a few related Delphic oracles as well.76 However,  monotheistic religion, where, the believer, in lieu of worrying about the identity of the  god that may have been insulted, needs to be informed about the nature of the offence  and of its redemption: “Christ always does bad things to me. I don’t know what to  do to satisfy him” (Banfield 1958, 124). Interestingly, the same is true for questions  to the local god concerning the cause (and remedy) of illness and other misfortune as  prevalent in the so-called confession stelai from Lydia and Phrygia, which testify to a  henotheistic piety. See p. 45 and n. 77 below. 74 In the source references, P. refers to Parke 1967; P.-W. to Parke and Wormell  1956; Lhôte = Lhôte 2006. On the oracles from Dodona see below n. 79. 75 Scheer 2001, 46–47 in her chapter “Worum man betet: Gebetsinhalte,” complains  that we have few “Gebetstexte” from non-literary sources. She avers that in Versnel  1981a, 4 ff. I tried to circumvent this problem by equating (“gleichsetzen” [2x]) oracle  questions from Dodona with ancient prayer texts. I did nothing of the kind nor am  I (or anybody else) in desperate need of her ample demonstration that oracles are  not the same as prayers. I used these oracles to illustrate “with what daily cares the  common man was beset in Antiquity,” which is precisely the maximum profit that  Scheer herself is willing to accept. For that matter, many scholars have pointed out  that the emotional involvement in questions submitted to an oracle may make it diffi- cult to maintain a strict distinction between the wish to know (oracle) and the hope to  achieve (prayer), as Croesus knew well in his altercation with Apollo and as is further  attested by the rich Delphic treasure houses. See: Rudhardt 1958, 58 and 272 ff. Cf. for  the junction of oracle and prayer in Egyptian oracle texts e.g. A. Bülow-Jacobsen, ZPE  57 (1984) 91 f. On Christian oracle questions with pleas such as: “give an oracle that is  to my advantage” and instructions to pray during one or more nights (not in order to  receive a negative oracle, one may presume), see: A. Papaconstantinou, Oracles chré- tiens dans l’Égypte byzantine: le témoignage des papyrus, ZPE 104 (1994) 281–286.  The assumption that, once the identity of the god has been revealed, the prayer would  be much more elaborate, detailed or precise than “I pray that my eyes will be better,”  as Scheer seems to postulate, does not find support in the hundreds of brief votive  inscriptions (mostly from later periods) as summarized in Versnel 1981, 8 ff. One may  also compare the mostly very brief ‘letters to God’ consisting of the formula “for the  health of . . .” in churches world-wide.  76 P.-W. nos. 32; 326, 335. In later oracular practice of the imperial period and above  all in Asia Minor both term and concept are common. E.g. already in an inscription of  4th–3d c. BC published by G.E. Bean, JHS 74 (1954) 85–110; cf. R. Merkelbach, ZPE 5  (1970) 48; SEG 40.1109; SGO I 01/09/01, the people of Kaunos inquiring which gods  they must appease (ἱλασκομένου) to secure a good harvest with the answer of the  oracle of Grynion: “Phoebus son of Leto and Zeus Patroos.” A particularly interesting  question from Didyma by a person who asked “which god he should placate in order  </page> <page sequence="23">  many gods: complications of polytheism 45 among the oracle questions of the classical period such questions form  a minority. To go on the available evidence, mishap in daily life was  not predominantly interpreted as a divine penalty in this  period.77 Of more interest to our issue, however, is a different, more future- oriented and less guilt-inspired, type of inquiry, which brings us into  the centre of oracular activity.78 Once again, a brief glance into this  specific type of evidence will set us on the track of an essential char- acteristic of Greek polytheism. In the sacred area of Zeus Naios and  Dione at Dodona in Northwestern Greece numerous79 oracle  questions  to be able to (literally) ‘recall’ his wife from the Christian faith” (interroganti. . . . quem  deum placando revocare possit uxorem suam a Christianismo): Aug.

In Phrygian confession-texts, for instance,  as collected in Petzl 1994, people in misery are constantly on the lookout for pos- sible religious offences that may explain their illness or mishap.

For the classical period our  sources may suffer from distortion due to an Athenian bias.  78 Out of the enormous literature on Greek oracles I mention the brief introduc- tion by V.

It was about time, too, for they were found in excavations of more than  60 years ago. S. Dakaris (†), I. Vokotopoulou (†), A.-F. Christidis (†), Corpus des  Lamelles Oraculaires de Dodone I, (CLOD) is now announced as ‘in the press’. Until  recently SEG 15.385–409; 19.426–432; 23.474–476; 25.454; 43.318–331; 48.819–22,  offered the easiest access to a majority of published oracle texts.

The texts range from the 6th to  the 2nd centuries BC and were, to judge from the handwriting, as a  rule written by the enquirers themselves, who used their own Greek  dialects.80 Two formulaic questions prevail in the texts. One is the enquiry  “whether it will be better (λώιον καὶ βέλτιον and variants) to act in  a certain way . . .” The other is “To whom of the gods (and heroes)  must I pray and/or sacrifice in order that I fare better?” (or “to achieve  what I have in mind” and variants).81 From the Dodonian oracle we  do not have responses to this particular type of question. But here  Delphi, with its far more renowned oracle, fills the gap.82 There are  significant differences between Dodona and Delphi.83 The majority  of the Dodonean questions concern private matters of individuals  whose authentic autographs have come down to us.84 Those of Delphi  generally concern social and political units (or their representatives),  poleis, realms, kings.85 With few exceptions they have been transmitted  80 Parke 1967, has an extensive discussion. See also: Versnel 1981a, 4–6; C. Tzouvara- Souli gives a survey of the information on daily life problems and the origins of the  pilgrims in: Μνήμη ƕωτήρη ∆άκαρη (Ioannina 1997) 29–70 (in Greek). Cf. also: G. Rou- gemont, in: Y. Le Bohec &amp; Y. Roman (edd.), Épigraphie et histoire: acquis et problèmes  (Lyon 1998) 71–76. On the different dialects see: Lhôte 2006, 363–406. 81 As for instance in SEG 15.395; 386.  82 Collections: Parke-Wormell 1956; J. Fontenrose, The Delphic Oracle: its Responses  and Operations with a Catalogue of Responses (Berkeley 1978).  83 When, on the one hand, Sourvinou-Inwood 1988 = 2000b, 44–47, argues that  “the individual was the basic cultic unit,” and, on the other, Auffarth 1994b, 19 wishes  to differentiate this view by stating: “Die Fragen, die dem Orakel vorgelegt werden,  betreffen in der Regel Poleis als ganze, nicht Individuen,” a comparison of Dodona  and Delphi shows that both views are valid depending on the chosen contexts. The  same is true for the putative opposition (as represented in Auffarth 1994b, 19) of  Vernant’s focus on the flight from rational decision-making into the irrationality of  uncontrollable divine responses (Parole et signes muets, in: J.-P. Vernant et alii [edd.],  Divination et rationalité [Paris 1974] espec. 11–19) versus Robert Parker’s (o.c. [78  n. 78] 304) interpretation of the oracle as a rational forum for interstate negotiation.  84 The collection of public enquiries in Parke pp. 259–262 is now superseded by  Lhôte nos. 1–17. An example: in P. 260 no. 3 = Lhôte no. 3, the Corcyraeans ask “to  which of the gods and heroes they should sacrifice and pray in order to obtain con- cord with good results” (τίνι κα θεῶν Ȏ ἡρώων θύοντες καὶ εὐχ[ό]μενοι ὁμονοῖεν ἐ[π]ὶ  τɄγαθόν. Cf. J. Vokotopulou, in: La Magna Grecia e i grandi santuari della madre  patria (Taranto 1995) 63–90, discussing the oracle questions as collected in SEG  43.318–320: questions by the people of Tarentum and Regium. 85 Sometimes we hear that both these oracles were consulted for the same issue. In  348 BC the Athenians received the same answer from both centres (ὁμοίως ἐκ ∆ελφῶν  καὶ ἐκ ∆ωδώνης) (Dem. 21.51 = P.-W. no. 282). Fontenrose 253 h28 suggests that  the prose text is from Dodona and the the one in verse from Delphi. Cf. no. 108. On  the gradual shift towards private consultation at Delphi, see: M. Arnush, Pilgrimage to  </page> <page sequence="25">  many gods: complications of polytheism 47 through literary sources and are partially legendary. Yet, the phras- ing of the questions relevant to our discussion is identical to that of  Dodona, as for instance: “to which god must we sacrifice or pray in  order to get the best of it?”86 Hence, when Xenophon Anab. 3.1.5 f.  (P.-W. no. 172) chose to ask Delphic Apollo “to whom of the gods he  should sacrifice and pray in order to have a prosperous journey and a  safe return,” he followed a traditional course of action. As did Socrates  (ibid.), who censured him for not having asked the other conventional  question, no less common at Delphi:87 “whether it would be better  (λˑιον) for him to go or to stay.”88 From Delphi (and elsewhere) we do have answers. However, if they  may have been transparent and meaningful to the local priesthood,  they were not nearly always so to the consultants. Here is an oracular  answer to the question to which of the gods the Athenians should pay  homage in order to defeat the Persians (P.-W. no. 102, 479 BC): You must pray to Zeus, to Hera of Kithairon, to Pan and the Sphragitic  Nymphs, and sacrifice to the heroes Androkrates, Leukon, Peisandros,  Damokrates, Hypsion, Aktaion, Polyeidos. Plutarch V.Arist. 11.3, to whom we owe this oracle response, explains  that the majority of these gods and heroes belonged to the pantheon  of Plataea, where the battle to which the oracle referred, was to take  place. Zeus, of course, is a deity common to all Greeks.89 the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi: Patterns of Public and Private Consultation, in: Elsner  &amp; Rutherford 2005, 97–110. 86 P.-W. no. 283. Cf. nos. 32; 429, and cf. the oracle answers discussed below p. 48.  87 In fact they cover 51.4% of Fontenrose’s ‘historical responses’ (p. 21). It was so  formulaic that Sulla made a pun on it, for which see: E. Badian, An Oracle for Delphic  Apollo, The Ancient History Bulletin 11 (1987) 13. From the answers it appears that  the Spartans, in doubt about how to oppose the Persian approach (479 BC), asked a  question of the latter type and the Athenians one of the former (Plut. Arist. 11.3–5).  On the discussion between Socrates and Xenophon see: L. Bruit-Zaidman, Xénophon  entre dévotion privée et dévotion publique. L’exemple de l’Anabase, in: Dasen &amp;  Piérart 2005, 99–111, espec. 100 f. 88 It is exactly on this question that we have an anwer in a tablet of Dodona (P.270,  no. 23; Lhôte no. 12): “remain where you are and persevere.” That this is an answer  is ensured by the fact that it is written by another hand. See Lhôte pp. 355–358 for a  discussion of oracular answers, assumed or confirmed.  89 Plutarch does not give a verbatim oracle text but a close paraphrase. How easily  gods or heroes may slip into or duck out of such lists appears from Clem. Al. Protr.  2.40, who records the following list of Plataean heroes from the oracle: Androkrates,  Demokrates, Kuklaios, Leukon. </page> <page sequence="26"> 48 chapter one Understandably, the criterion of selection of gods and heroes here is  not one of function or specialism, but one of local or regional rel- evance. In a situation of war it is not a bad idea to call in the assistance  of the local gods. Less perspicuous, however, is the list prescribed by  the Delphic oracle in answer to a question concerning health and good  fortune (Dem. 21.51 = P.-W. no. 282, before 348 BC.): For good health you must sacrifice and pray to Zeus Hupatos, Herakles,  Apollo Prostaterios. Concerning good fortune to Apollo Aguieus, Leto,  Artemis . . . . And when the Athenians enquire to which god they should sacrifice or  pray with respect to a celestial portent they learn (Dem. 43.66 = P.-W.  no. 283, before 340 BC.): With respect to the portent it is to the Athenians’ advantage to sacri- fice with good omens (θύειν καὶ καλλιερεῖν) to Zeus Hupatos, Athena  Hupate, Herakles, Apollo Soter. (. . .) Concerning good fortune to Apollo  Aguieus, Leto, Artemis. To a certain extent there is consistency between the two lists but the  internal cohesion of the different gods and heroes in each of them,  as well as the reason of the differences between the two is less than  transparent.90 Finally, the question by Poseidonios of Halikarnassos (c. 300 BC?)91  “what is better for him and his family to do?” receives the response: It will be better for them if they propitiate and honour in line with their  ancestors Zeus Patroios and Apollo lord of Telmessos and the Moirai  and the Mother of the Gods, and also to honour and propitiate Agathos  Daimon of Poseidonios and Gorgis. If they continue to perform these  rites it will be better for them. A list of deities, partly of local relevance again, partly closely connected  with the family, and partly of unclear connection with the enquirer.  The addition, however, clarifies that the family was already in the habit  of honouring some of these gods. To summarize: the poor enquirer who was at a loss about which  god he should address for specific worries and wishes might consult  90 See: H. Bowden, Classical Athens and the Delphic Oracle: Divination and Democ- racy (Cambridge 2005) 118 and 123 f. 91 B.Mus.Inscr. 4.1.896. It is well possible that this oracle comes from Telmessos.

What catches the eye, however, is that the questions are always  phrased in the singular: “to which of the gods” (τίνι Dzν θεῶν),92 while  all available answers mention extended and, at first sight, functionally  untransparent and theologically incoherent lists of gods and heroes.93  This principle of plurality appears to be so self-evident that Xenophon  loc. cit, though having asked “to which god he should pray,” relates as  a matter of course that Apollo in his oracle listed “the gods to whom  he should sacrifice.”94 The search for a—hopefully specific, expert  or appropriate—god ends up with a list of gods. Let us keep this in  mind. Expressing theological doubt Once you have learned—by oracle, tradition or situational prefer- ence—to which god or goddess you must address your prayer, can  you be sure that the name you have in mind is indeed the name of the  god whom you have in mind? No modern reader would cook up such  a question if the Greek evidence would not prompt him to. Hesitative  and dubitative formulas are not restricted to the areas of epiphany and  divination, but abound in an astounding—and meaningful—variety in  actual prayer and hymn. “Zeus, or by what (other) name you wish to  be invoked;” “listen to me, lord, whoever you may be;” “whichever  god it may be that lives in this place;” “whether god or goddess:” these  92 There is only one exception in the available evidence from Dodona and Delphi:  P. 267 no. 12 = Lhôte no. 65, τίνας θεῶν as cited above p. 44; cf. also the oracle from  Grynion above n. 76). This exception does show that the plural form of expression in  itself was not inconceivable. 93 Cf. also the inscription from Selinous mentioned below (p. 505) with A.

Sometimes the place and function of  each of the divine participants can be discovered with some effort, at other times this  exercise remains without convincing success, which of course does not necessarily  imply that there was no system in the plurality. See also Burkert 1985, 217.  94 Xenophon also adds that he did sacrifice later to the gods whom the god had  mentioned Anab. 3.1.8. The list must have included Zeus Basileus (Anab. 6.1.22, and  see below p. 63, with n. 149). The stereotyped answer in the plural can even induce  errors in modern translations: Fontenrose 298, Q89 gives as the question in P.-W. 32  “What gods should they propitiate . . .” although the Greek text has: τίνα Dzν θεῶν. </page> <page sequence="28"> 50 chapter one are some common expressions of doubt in Graeco-Roman antiquity.95  Take for instance the famous pronouncement in Aesch. Ag. 160–163: Zeus, whoever he is, if this name is welcome to him when he is called by  it, by this name do I address him (Ɖεύς, ὅστις ποτ’ ἐστίν, εἰ τόδ’ αὐτˑ  φίλον κεκλημένˎ, το˃το νιν προσεννέπω).96 Commentators97 agree that at this place the expression does not imply  a defective insight into the identity of the deity who is invoked, but is  intended to articulate the inscrutable magnitude of the supreme divine  power, which cannot be captured in one name.98 In the present context  this is plausible enough. The highest God in particular is frequently  addressed with similar formulas of ‘philosophical caution’ such as  “whoever you may be” and “by whatever name I must address you,”  sometimes specified by disjunctive “either. . . . either” lists. The topos resounds throughout antiquity. In the fifth century BC,  Eur. Tro. 885 f.: “whoever you are, you who are hard to know, Zeus  (ὅστις ποτ’ εȢ σύ, δυστόπαστος εἰδέναι, Ɖεύς), whether the Necessity  of Nature or the Mind of Mortals, I pray to you . . . .” In the fourth cen- tury AD: Julian Or. 231A: “O Father Zeus or whatever name pleases  95 Collections and discussions in: C.

P.M. Smith, On the Hymn to Zeus in Aeschylos’ Agamemnon (Chico  1980) 8–19 has a good discussion. But cf. the criticism and the new interpretation by  Zajcev 1996.  97 Sometimes referring to Orphic or Pythagorean philosophical trends as sources of  inspiration. Herakleitos’ “One thing, the only truly wise, does not and does consent to  be called by the name of Zeus” comes close as well. 98 P. Groeneboom, Aeschylus’ Agamemnon (Groningen 1944) 151: “indicates that  the poet was not able or willing to form an idea of the Father of the gods” (my transl.  HSV); W.G. Headlam &amp; G.

Nor would it be wise to disqualify them as mere literary tropes. Plato  Cra. 400 E., an oft quoted passage, provides precious information: there is one excellent principle which, as men of sense, we must acknowl- edge—that of the gods we know nothing, either of their natures or of  the names, whatever they may be, by which they call themselves. For  it is clear that they use the true names. But there is a second principle,  namely to call them, as is customary (νόμος) in prayers, “by whatever  name and from whatever provenance you prefer to be called,” (οȡτινές  τε καὶ ὁπόθεν χαίρουσιν ὀνομαζόμενοι)100 since we do not know of any  other. The formula is indeed attested for several gods:101 Eur. Bacch. 275 f.:  “Demeter Goddess, she is Earth, whichever name you prefer, do call  her so” (∆ημήτερ Θεά, Ɔῆ δ’ ἐστίν, ὄνομα δ’ ὁπότερον βούλʤ κάλει). In  Plato Phlb. 12C, Socrates says: “and now, as to Aphrodite, in what way  it pleases her, so do I address her” (καὶ ν˃ν τὴν μὲν Ǹφροδίτην, ὅπʤ  ἐκείνʤ φίλον, ταύτʤ προσαγορεύω). We have landed here in the sphere  of allusion,102 whence a touch of irony may be involved.  However, this   99 More examples for Zeus: Headlam-Thomson (o.c. preceding note) 23. E.g. Eur.

Fr. 912,  Ɖεɞς εἴτ’ Αȡδης ὀνομάζομενος στέργεις, rather concerns the question whether Zeus  Chthonios and Hades are the same person or not. Cf. West 1978, ad v. 465. Lloyd- Jones 1971, 85 f., tends to downplay the relevance of comparable prior or contempo- raneous expressions for Aeschylean philosophy, preserving only Homer and Hesiod  as sources of inspiration. Most recently on this: Parker 2009, 154 n. 80. 100 According to Philostr. VA 3.41, Apollonios of Tyana still took part in discus- sions in which “they handled the problems of sacrifice and of the invocations in which  the gods took pleasure” (θυσιῶν τε ȑπτοντο καὶ κλήσεων αἷς θεοὶ χαίρουσι). Cf. Men.  Rh. II 446.8–9: εἴτε οȾν ταύταις χαίρεις ταῖς προσηγορίαις, εἴτε ἀμείνοσι . . . But here  we are in a different atmosphere as discussed below p. 54 ff.. On the topos of divine  pleasure in his name and epithets see: Pulleyn 1997, 105. 101 Not only for gods, at least not in later antiquity. ƍαὶ ὡς χρηματίζω (“and how  I may further be called”) is a fixed addition to (sometimes complete) series of names  and titles of elite authors of official texts on papyri : cf. LSJ s.v. χρηματίζω III. The  expression seems to include both functions and names. Y. Broux, S. Coussements &amp;  M. Depauw, καὶ ὡς χρηματίζει and the Importance of Naming in Roman Egypt, ZPE  174 (2010) 159–166, propose the interpretation: “and with all the other names and  titles with which he normally acts in an official context.” 102 Socrates here disqualifies his opponent’s suggestion to equate erotic pleasure  with the goddess Aphrodite. </page> <page sequence="30"> 52 chapter one does not detract from its evidential value. Quite to the contrary, appli- cation in comedy or, more generally, in the sphere of ironic parody  and pun furnishes decisive proof that formulas and expressions were  current among large sections of the population, including less edu- cated strata.103 In Ar. Ach. 566, the chorus addresses the general Lama- chos as a god, invoking him to appear and help, while adding: εἴτ’ ἔστι  ταξίαρχος Ȏ στρατηγὸς Ȏ τειχομάχας ἀνήρ. . . . .104 In Athen. 8.334B  an interlocutor says “the author who wrote the Kupria, whether he is  some Cyprian or a Statinos or whoever he may like to be called” (Ȏ  ὅστις δή ποτε χαίρει ὀνομαζόμενος).105 Both are clear allusions to the  prayer formula. Plato, in particular, is fond of these allusive tropes.106 What is the function or meaning of these dubitative formulas?  In the scholarly discussion these two—function and meaning—have  often been identified or rather confused with origin. Long ago Usener  argued that their origin was closely connected with the power inherent  in the name, knowledge of which implies power over the god.107 He  explains the accumulation of epithets as a strategy to prevent omission  or error: “man tut darin lieber des Guten zuviel als daß man sich der  Gefahr aussetzt das entscheidende Wort zu übersehen.” Generally, in  works of the late 19th and early 20th century emphasis has been put  on this (magical) power of names and especially on the power that  103 For Greek prayer parody see: Kleinknecht 1937, Horn 1970. For Roman: Guit- tard 1998, 81 f.  104 This line does not seem to refer to Lamachos but to another potential saviour.  Yet, Kleinknecht 1937, 78, is surely right to take this as a perseveration of the prayer  parody. As does Horn 1970, 23 and 53. Cf. S.D. Olson, Aristophanes Acharnians  (Oxford 2002) 221 f.  105 Another clear instance of prayer parody in Ar. Nub. 269–274. Cf. Kleinknecht  1937, index s.v. εἴτε.  106 See a collection in Kleinknecht 1937, espec. 130 ff., for the formula “with what- ever name you like to be called” as used by Plato. E.g. Pl.

Plato consistently pictures Socrates as extremely dif- fident with respect to the correct use of divine names: Phlb. 12C; Cra. 400D (where,  of course, it suits his argument).  107 Usener 1896, 335 f. “Der Glaube an die Wirksamkeit feierlichen, inbrünstigen  Gebets beruht ursprünglich in der Überzeugung, durch die Kraft des Wortes und der  Formel den Gott beschwören, seinen Willen bannen und zwingen zu können.” On  Usener’s impact on the search for origins of religious notions and names, see: A.

Rum- pelstilzchen, of course, was an esteemed regular in these arguments.  “To know the name of a daemon is to acquire power over him,” thus  the brief summary by Eduard Fraenkel.108 The principle is particularly  demonstrable in magical practice where it always remained a privi- leged element.109 It would not be prudent, however, to project the allegedly origi- nal ‘magical’ concept of the power of the name onto all later types of  prayer addresses.110 Recent scholarship, justly more cautious concern- ing references to ‘magical’ aspects, rather speaks of the fear of offend- ing a deity or failing to attract his attention by using the wrong name.111  Here the need for precision may entail lack of precision, namely in the  suspension of choice: long lists of names or epithets in a demonstra- tive embarras du choix. In a detailed discussion of this issue, Pulleyn,  hits the mark with his no-nonsense argument: “You cannot utter a  prayer without naming the god to whom it is addressed. Knowledge  108 E. Fraenkel loc. cit. (above n. 98). Of course, the power of (secret) divine names  is a constitutive element in Neo-Platonic and theurgic theory and practice of Late  Antiquity, which, however, falls outside the chronological boundaries of our subject.  I have collected literature on this in: Versnel 2002a, n. 33. Add: M. Hirschle, Sprach- philosophie und Namenmagie im Neuplatonismus (Beiträge zur Klassischen Philologie  96, Meisenheim 1979). For Orphic Hymns see: Morand 2001, 68–76.  109 Instead of dubitative or laudatory εἴτε . . . . εἴτε formulas, magical texts may pic- ture the practitioner as boasting that he does know ‘the many names’ of a god or  demon, as for instance in PGM IV 2344: οȢδα σὰ τὰ καλὰ καὶ μεγάλα, ƍόρη, ὀνόματα  σεμνά. Note, however, that ‘dubitative’ addresses occur just the same in magical texts,  where the practitioner is not sure about which demon he is evoking: δαῖμον ὅστις ποτ’  εȢ / demon quicumque es: A. Audollent, Defixionum Tabellae (Paris 1904) nos. 242,  286. Cf. ibid. formulas as sive quo alio nomine voltis adpellari (no. 129, cf. no. 196) and  F.

Especially in texts concerning exorcism the  knowledge of the name of the demon that causes an illness or of the god who is able to  perform this trick is essential: Ch. Stewart, Demons and the Devil: Moral Imagination  in Modern Greek Culture (Princeton 1991) 213–216. 110 See the discussion in D. Aubriot, L’invocation au(x) dieu(x) dans la prière  grecque: contrainte, persuasion ou théologie? in: Belayche e.a. 2005, 473–490, espec.  474 ff., with a discussion of polyonymy at pp. 482–486.  111 One for all: Gwyn Griffitihs 1975, 119 f. “Knowing his correct name is vitally  important: nomen numen. It was then essential to specify the function of the deity  which was most suited to respond to the particular request which the petitioner had  in mind. Here an anxiety not to overlook the exactly relevant function often led to  an expression of uncertainty which might seem to apply even to the identity of the  god invoked.”  </page> <page sequence="32"> 54 chapter one of the name is a prerequisite to any form of communication.112 There  need not be anything magical about it.”113 But this does not affect—still  less resolve—the central problem of how you can be sure to know the  correct (= effective) name of a/the god. When Pulleyn adds: “I do not  understand why it is thought that one had to ‘discover’ the name of  the god,” we should at least seriously consider Plato’s answer implied  in the passage cited above about the customary prayer formulas. Here  the formula is unequivocally placed in the context of human lack of  insight into divine prosopography. Even fully acknowledging its rhe- torical function in the Kratylos,114 we cannot ignore this interpreta- tion, by a Greek for Greeks, of the dubitative prayer formula. In other  words, even if we are ready to dismiss the idea that knowing the name  of a god implies having power over that god, this should not make  us forget that knowing the name is an absolute condition for getting  access to the divine source of power. The final goal is not to discover  the name of a god (although this may occur as well ) but to choose the  contextually appropriate name. And, evidently, Greeks did not con- sider this a trivial dilemma.115 All this is not to deny that these formulas tended to move from the  sphere of doubt to that of praise. In earlier hymnic texts, the majority  of lists of names consist of the god’s toponymic epithets. The author’s  (pretended) doubt about the ‘correct name’ enables him to flatter  the god with long strings of titles under which he is worshipped in  112 He was preceded in this formula by Arnobius, Adv. Haer. 3.42 omnis enim qui  quaerit alicuius numinis impetrare responsum debeat necessario scire cui supplicat. 113 Pulleyn 1997, 96–115, espec. 97. One motive for his emphatic rejection of any  compulsory implication in prayer is his central concept of charis, which, being an act  of reciprocity, in his view dominates the communication between god and men and  thus not allows for compulsion. This is good as far as it goes. Rather far here and in  R. Seaford, Reciprocity and Ritual: Homer and Tragedy in the Developing City-state  (Oxford 1994); just far enough in R.C.T.

Cult centres are the visible testimonies of the  god’s supreme power.116 Already in archaic literature, to begin with  Hesiod,117 terms like polyonymos, ‘with many names’, function as  pearls in the crown of praise. In the Classical period they are no less  popular. For instance, Soph. Fr. 941, 2, praises (Aphrodite) Kupris as  πολλῶν ὀνομάτων ἐπώνυμος.118 Significant again is its prevalence in  ironic contexts. In Ar. Plut. 1164, Hermes, who has just listed his own  names and epithets, is jokingly lauded: “How marvellous to have many  names (πολυωνυμίας).” In Callim. H.Artemis 7 f., Artemis asks her  father Zeus: “Grant me to keep my virginity for ever, daddy, and to  be of many names (πολυωνυμίην), that Phoebus may not sneeringly  contend with me.”119 These expressions gain impetus in the Hellenistic and Roman eras  and tend to expand into long aretalogical praises, notably in the cult  of Isis.120 The prayer to Isis in Apuleius Met. 11.2 exemplarily summa- rizes the fixed scheme of numerous hymnic prayers: “Whether thou  art Ceres, . . . or heavenly Venus, . . . . or the sister of Phoebus, . . . . or  Proserpina” . . . . . . “by whatever name or ceremony or visage it is right  to address thee” (quoquo nomine, quoquo ritu, quaqua facie te fas  116 As is expressed in countless expressions such as “you who rule over (μέδεις,  κατέχεις). . . . .” and variants. See: Keyssner 1937, 75–79. The same holds for Egyptian  and Hebrew prayers: A. Barucq, L’expression de la louange divine et de la prière dans  la Bible et en Egypte (Cairo 1962) 22 ff. and passim. Ovid Met. 4.11–21 is exemplary  in listing epithets of Dionysos, while first adding et quae praeterea per Graias plurima  gentes nomina, Liber, habes, and then continuing with his great conquests: India etc.  117 Hes. Th. 785; H.Apollo 82; H.Demeter 18. See: Richardson 1974 ad loc. for dis- cussion of the term and literature. Usener 1896, 334 n. 7, gives already a survey of the  evidence. Cf.

Centuries later her wish is fulfilled in a hymn from Samos where the  goddess is invoked with the epithet πολυώνυμος (IG XII.6.2, no. 604, 3rd c. AD). 120 Not only in Isis cult though, as we shall see shortly in the case of Apollo Smin- thios. Cf. e.g. the Naassene hymn to Attis: E. Heitsch, Die griechischen Dichterfrag- mente der römischen Kaiserzeit (Göttingen 1961) 156 no. 2, to be read with Von  Wilamowitz’ unbeatably acidulous comments (on colleagues) in Hermes 37 (1902)  329–332.

Isis, as the central deity, is identified with—or rather  absorbs—other great goddesses in distant countries.124 In the late third  century AD, Menander Rhetor still recommends both strategies—the  old Greek one and the later Hellenistic one—for epideictic praises of  the god Apollo Sminthios: By what names shall I address you? Some call you Lydian, some Delian,  some Ascraean, some Actian. The Spartans call you Amyclaean, the  Athenians Patroos, the Milesians Branchiate. You control every city and  land and nation. You control the whole inhabited earth (. . .). The Per- sians call you Mithras, the Egyptians Horus, the Thebans Dionysos, the  121 See the extensive commentary by Griffiths 1975.

MacMullen  1981, 90 f. with n. 57, has a good discussion on the concepts behind words like myri- onymous and polyonymous in the Roman period. For classical Greece see: D. Aubriot,  o.c. (above n. 110). Note that in the (late) Orphic hymns the vocative polyonyme figures  side by side with other epithets of 14 different deities (Mussies 1988, 17; Morand 2001,  73, with n. 154). Understandably so: some Orphic hymns consist nearly exclusively of  long lists of epithets. On the function of this accumulation: M. Hopman-Govers, Les  jeux des épithètes dans les Hymnes Orphiques, Kernos 14 (2001) 35–49. The epithet  was (of course) duly inherited by the holy Virgin, as were so many other features of  Greek/Hellenistic goddesses. See: Borgeaud 1996 (tr. Mother of the Gods: From Cybele  to the Virgin Mary [Baltimore 2004]), who views the Virgin Mary as just one more  complex representation of ‘the Mother.’ 123 Y. Grandjean, Une nouvelle arétalogie d’Isis à Maronée (Leiden 1975) v. 19. This  idea, too, is anticipated in classical Greek texts: Aesch. PV 209 f., Θέμις καὶ Ɔαῖα  πολλῶν ὀνομάτων μόρφη μία. 124 This is not the same as the older custom to equate one Greek god with one  foreign god as best known from Herodotus, on which Burkert 1990; Harrison 2000,  208–222. Early elements of ‘syncretistic’ tendencies may rather be recognized in are- talogical formulas of omnipotence such as in H.Aphrodite 31–2: “In all the temples of  the gods she has a share of honour, and among all mortal men she is chief of the god- desses,” and compare Hes. Th. 413–417 on Hekate. For the sense in which I am using  the term ‘syncretistic’ I refer to the good brief discussion in Allan 2004, 116–120. </page> <page sequence="35">  many gods: complications of polytheism 57 Delphians honour you by the double name of Apollo and Dionysos (. . .)  The Chaldaeans call you the leader of the stars.125 Here all the characteristics of these polyonomastic strategies converge:  Gods may be praised with a choice of topographical epithets (even if  the god is from the outset marked himself as a local deity by such an  epiklesis: Smintheus). The deity may also be equated or identified with  foreign great gods. In either case there is no doubt about the initial  identity of the invoked god. Menander stipulates that it is all intended  as a hymnic expression of the god’s worldwide sovereignty.126 As such  they are typically henotheistic expressions.127 We must conclude that identical expressions of embarras du choix  may be applied for different purposes and in different functions and  even meanings. The worst you can do is to shackle everything in one  universal straightjacket. The Greeks, at any rate, did not. Nor, for that  matter, did the Romans.

Chthonian gods of the Netherworld may very well qualify as they are  often referred to as anonymoi,138 but they may equally well be coun- terparts of the Roman anonymous gods of the sive deus sive dea type,  who, according to Aul. Gell. 2.28.2–3, were propitiated after an earth- quake “since it was uncertain what force and which of the gods or  goddesses had caused the earthquake” (quoniam et qua vi et per quem  deorum dearumve tremeret incertum esset).139 The latter case, at any rate, clearly betrays either the fear of erring in  the selection of the correct god or the correct name, or, more gener- ally, a total lack of insight concerning the identity of the god involved.  As we have seen, this is not necessarily so in all expressions of doubt or  choice that we discussed. Even so, theological suspension often glim- mers through in various expressions. The types of incongruities and uncertainties pictured in the three  sections above, are largely, if perhaps only vaguely, known among stu- dents of ancient Greek culture. Yet, it is hard to avoid the impression  that only few of them are able to resist the temptation to suppress,  forget or smooth over these irritating little scratches on the golden  image of our orderly classic Greek culture. To quote Vernant once  again: “How could these men, whose exacting rigor in the realms of  intellectual consistency is extolled, have lived their religious life in a  kind of chaos?” My suggestion, conversely, would be that this first  encounter with gods of dubious identities and with questions of theo- logical doubt should rather invite us to follow Socrates’ own words (Pl.  Phlb. 12 C): “In the matter of names of gods my fear is beyond human  measure, nothing indeed makes me so afraid.” In many respects the  issue of divine names appears to be a far more disquieting problem  than we tend to realize or acknowledge. And with this introduction  137 Hieron. Comm. in Ep. ad Titum 1.12 = PL 26.607: “The altar inscription is not,  as Paul asserted, ‘To an unknown god’ but as follows: ‘To the gods of Asia, Europe,  and Africa, to the unknown and foreign gods.” Cf.

It is the  very topic of polyonymy that will lead us in medias res. 2. Names and surnames: one god or many? Doubts about the identity of an appearing god, hesitation concerning  the question which god should be approached in precarious circum- stances, uncertainty about the correctness of given names, so far our  first encounter with implications and complications of Greek poly- theism. An alarming plethora of gods to begin with. Their numbers  seem to be liable to infinite multiplication as a result of a peculiar phe- nomenon that we have come across in passing. If Nausicaa had been  a goddess and if Odysseus’ guess had been correct, that would have  been the end of the story: Homeric theology knows only one Artemis.  The case of the Lycaonians is different: their Zeus and Hermes were  not the same as the ancient Greek ones or so it seems. Must we, in  consequence, assume a coexistence of several different Zeuses, several  Hermeses? The epithet and other identifiers It is time to complicate matters a bit further. The best way to broach  the problem that emerges here is to take our departure from the notion  expressed by the term epithet (from Greek epitheton, also epiklesis), an  until recently140 curiously neglected chapter in the study of Greek reli- gion.141 Greek gods, as we saw, were occasionally exalted as being poly- 140 The text of this section as presented here was for the greater part written years  before I gave the lectures. Recently there has been a remarkable increase in studies  and discussions on divine epithets. There is much of interest in the two volumes of  Les panthéons des cités, edited by Motte 1998 and Pirenne-Delforge 1998 respectively.  Important in particular: R.C.T. Parker in his M.P. Nilsson lecture, ‘The Problem of the  Greek Cult Epithet’, Opuscula Atheniensia 28 (2003) 173–183, with detailed and infor- mative discussion and bibliography. He argues that the cult epithet system intertwines  two principal functions, those of selecting the relevant aspects of a deity, and of indi- viduating cult sites on earth. Precisely where he ends his paper with a quick note on  the unity of the divine figure behind the epithets, my present argument begins. Most  recently appeared the important comprehensive collection of Belayche et alii 2005. I  feel relieved that these more recent studies did not force me to make any change of  importance in what I had written, but instead did a lot to corroborate it.  141 “Die Epiklesenforschung steckt in den Kinderschuhen,” thus: A.

In fact, practically all Greek gods were  entitled to that qualification due to the fact that, in prayer, ritual and  literature, they were referred to with a variety of predicates and sur- names.142 These epithets, as far as they are transparent, generally refer  to specific functions, qualities, rituals, genealogy, and above all places  of origin and residence (ὁπόθεν χαίρουσιν ὀνομαζόμενοι). Let us take  a look at this phenomenon, which is so typical of Greek polytheism. In the festive calendar of the small Attic community of Erchia143  Apollo144 is honoured under no fewer than six different epithets— the product of a suspicion that there is indeed nothing illuminating to be said except  about particular examples.” 142 C.H.F.

Another polyonymos in the  same calendar is Zeus. He is mentioned twice without epithet, and further has the  epithets: Meilichios, Polieus, Epoptes, Epakrios, Teleios, Horios. Apollo and Zeus are  the most prominent gods in other calendars as well (see: Mikalson 1983, 70 f.). The  other gods are less lavishly provided, which, of course, is not necessarily indicative of  their general wealth or dearth of epithets. In Pausanias alone, for instance, one counts  59 epithets of Athena (Loeb ed. V. index p.206). It is true, though, that Zeus seems  to dwarf all other gods. For Zeus in Athens cf. R.E. Wycherley, The Olympieion at  Athens, GRBS 5 (1964) 161–179, espec. his “Synopsis of Zeus Cults at Athens,” 175 ff.  For a full list of epithets of Zeus see: H. Schwabl, Zeus RE X A (1972) 253–376 =  idem, Zeus (Munich 1978). Quite a few epithets have only a single attestation and new  epithets emerge regularly, especially in inscriptions from Asia Minor.

How are we to value divine  epithets? As a device for making a distinction between two different  but homonymous gods, or as indications of different manifestations,  functions or aspects of one and the same god? It is amazing how rashly  many modern observers tend to take the latter option for granted,145 or  just disregard the whole question as a quantité négligeable.146 I would  propose to try taking the dilemma seriously—a dilemma, moreover,  that counts among the most interesting, typical and meaningful in the  field of Greek polytheistic conceptualization, and not only because  both viewpoints can be persuasively defended. Different or the same? While bearing the same ‘first name’, Zeus  Olympios (or Zeus Basileus), the great king of heavens, so blatantly  differs from Zeus Meilichios, a decidedly chthonian character often  portrayed as a snake,147 that, as has often been observed, they can  hardly be understood as two different manifestations of one and the  Kommission der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Ergänzungsbände zu  den Tituli Asiae Minoris 14) 329–338. However, for cult calendars the general rule is  phrased by E.R. Dodds, ‘The Religion of the Ordinary Man in Classical Greece’, in:  The Ancient Concept of Progress (Oxford 1973) 140–155, espec. 153: ‘’nearly half of  the sacrifices listed are offered to no Olympian deity but to a menagerie of heroes,  daemons, and obscure godlings.”  145 This is a typical example of the risk, as J.S. Helfer, On Method in the History  of Ideas, H&amp;T Beiheft 8 (1968) 1–7, wrote, that “our conclusions are too frequently  functions of what we assume to be limits of understanding,” a scholarly tendency that  we will discuss later inter alia in reaction to a statement by Sourvinou-Inwood 1990 =  2000a, 18: “The gods who were worshipped in the different poleis were, of course, per- ceived to be the same gods (cf. also Hdt. 5.92–3). What differed was the precise articu- lation of the cult, its history, its particular modalities, which aspect of each deity each  city chose to emphasize. . . .” What I wish to (re-)consider in the present chapter con- cerns two elements of this statement, viz. “of course” and “were perceived.” The latter  expression, for instance, necessarily evokes the question “perceived by whom?” (Hdt  5.92–3, incidentally, is far from proving her point. See below p. 105 with n. 301).  146 Even those who admit the problem and accept a basic differentiation between  various homonymous gods always hasten to add that “essentially” they remain one  and the same god. See some examples below n. 177 f.  147 Which does not mean that any snake depicted in painting or relief should rep- resent Zeus Meilichios. On this god the most comprehensive study still is: A.B.

Xenophon during his Persian expedition enjoyed the  constant beneficial support of Zeus Basileus (Anab. 3.1.12; 6.1.22),  whereas Zeus Meilichios149 persecuted him because Xenophon, as he  found out too late, had failed to sacrifice a holocaust to him (Anab.  7.8.4).150 To complicate matters, a recent find reveals that, at least  locally, cults of several different Meilichioi, even devoid of the name  Zeus,151 occurred.152 148 Something similar can be said about the Roman Iuppiter and his chthonian  counterpart Veiovis (a name that, like Iuppiter, contained the element -iov-). Apart  from being a ‘subterranean Zeus’, Zeus Katachthonios or Chthonios was also a name  of Hades (Hom. Il. 9.4.57). When mention is made of ‘another Zeus’ (Aesch. Suppl.  231) or ‘the hospitable Zeus of the departed’ (Aesch. Suppl. 156) this always refers to  Hades.  149 How very difficult it is for the modern reader to accept as much as the possibil- ity that the Zeus Meilichios mentioned at this place (on whom see: O. Lendel, Kom- mentar zu Xenophons Anabasis [Darmstadt 1995] ad loc.), even despite the entirely  different type of sacrifice, simply may be a god different from Zeus Basileus, exemplar- ily appears in the Loeb edition by C.L. Brownson. Although he translates correctly:  “Xenophon replied that he had not sacrificed to that god” (τούτˎ τˑ θεˑ, as opposed  to the other god Zeus Basileus), he helpfully both corrects the author and misleads the  reader by commenting “i.e. Zeus in this particular one of his functions, as ‘the Merci- ful’.” Just so, but more explicitly Sourvinou-Inwood, below p. 519. 150 This clash between these two homonymous gods has often been noticed, most  recently by Parker 2003, 182. Pulleyn 1997, 98, considers the possibility that Xenophon  ignored one god by mispronouncing his name, but fortunately rejects this suggestion.  Vernant 1980, 99, who also paid attention to the inconsistency between the opposing  forces of two Zeuses (actually three: also Zeus Soter), does not view it as incompatible  with his principle of unity. See his statements below p. 70 with n. 177.  151 On the possible implications of the use of the epithet on its own see e.g. Graf  1985, 39: who, on the ground that exactly for chthonian characters of Zeus often the  mere epiklesis is used, surmises that behind the epiklesis a figure hides that so much  differs from the conventional image of Zeus that it easily became an autonomous  independent god. However, in contemporaneous inscriptions one finds both names  side by side, which suggests that the Greeks did not experience them as incompatible.  On the problems concerning the origin of epithets or predicates that occur separately  as genuine divine names (Eubouleus, Trophonios etc.) see: Graf ibid. 38.  152 In the, now famous, lex sacra from Selinous (460–450 BC) (Jameson e.a. 1993;  NGSL no. 28, with recent literature; a different—but not more convincing—interpre- tation: N. Robertson, Religion and Reconciliation in Greek Cities: The Sacred Laws of  Selinus and Cyrene [Oxford/New York 2010]) we find a (Zeus?) Meilichios (in the  plot) of Muskos and a (Zeus?) Meilichios (in the plot) of Euthydamos. Jameson e.a.  1993, 28, argue that Myskos and Euthydamos are the names of men who had estab- lished important gentilicial groups whose cults of Meilichios had become significant  for a wider section of the community.

C. Aurelius  Cotta, the champion of the Academic school of philosophy in Cic. ND  3.21 ff.,153 scorns “certain (Greek) theologians” (ii qui theologi nomi- nantur) who had figured out that there are three different gods with  the name Zeus, two of them born in Arcadia, the third in Crete, whose  tomb is shown on that island, their distinctions grounded on topo- graphical and genealogical arguments.154 In this type of literature there  is a proliferation of lists of gods that shelter different personae under  one name: four different Vulcani, five different gods named Hermes  and so on. Are these nothing more than theoretical constructions? How far can  we trust theologians? To go by Cicero, just as far as you can throw them  and everybody knows how far a theologian—ancient or modern—can  be thrown. Here is a Christian theologian, Minucius Felix, who in his  Octavius 22.5, after derisively listing different Dianae (Diana pictured  as a huntress, Diana Ephesia with many breasts, Diana Trivia with  three heads) and Ioves (Iupiter Ammon with horns, Capitolinus with  a lightning, Latiaris sprinkled with blood, etc.), ends up with the firm  conclusion: the much later cults for Gods owing their epithets to the founders of the cult in Asia  Minor. E.g. in Lydia: Μὴν Ǹρτεμιδώρου, Μὴν Ɩιάμου, in Phrygia: Ɖεɞς Ɩρωσου, and  other gods in different regions. See index TAM V.1; P. Herrmann &amp; K.Z.

Can they be so confused as to have  dozens of different gods with the same names? In order to show that the notion is not as far-fetched as it may  seem at first sight, let us cast a glance at contemporary de facto poly- theism.157 I must hasten to stress that I am interested in analogies in  the domain of the conceivable or the inconceivable in ideas relevant to  our topic—since “analogy comforts conjecture” (R. MacMullen)158—,  not in issues of continuity or tradition. I am fully aware of—and to a  certain extent share—recent distrust concerning the rationale of both  ‘the Mediterranean’ as an all-embracing and coherent concept159 and,  more especially, of the issue of continuity, including its relevance to  the conceptual framework of ancient Greek culture.160 155 ‘Monster’ here in the same derogatory sense as in monstrum hominis, mulieris:  “a monster of a man, of a woman.”  156 Quite a different view in Augustine C.D. 7.11, where he lists a long string of  epithets of Iuppiter and then comments: “They have assigned these cognomina to one  god for different reasons, on account of different powers; nevertheless, they did not  compel him to be as many gods as they had justifications for names.”  157 I borrow the term ‘de facto polytheism’ from R.J. Zwi Werblowsky, ‘Polytheism’  in ER 11 (1987) 439, who applies it inter alia to the cult of saints. 158 Cf. S. Freud, Gesammelte Werke vol. 15, 79: “Vergleiche entscheiden nichts, aber  sie können machen dass man ‘sich heimisch fühlt’.” Or, for those who do not feel at  home with “sich heimisch fühlen” or with Freud (or both): “Comparison provides  the means by which we ‘re-vision’ phenomena as our data in order to solve our theo- retical problems” (J.Z. Smith, Drudgery Divine [Chicago 1990] 52) or “Analogies will  not teach us what happened in the past: they may help to keep our reconstructions  within limits consistent with what is known to happen” (A.D. Nock, AJPh 65 [1944]  99–105). On the strengths and risks of analogy (the risks due to its potentially ideo- logical nature): L.

Personally I do feel that this critique risks overshooting the mark.  I endorse the sensible reply by Cohen 1991, 38–41, who argues that, despite many  differences, there are typical patterns of social practices that characterise a wide range  of Mediterranean communities, and which display a considerable similarity in the  underlying normative structure.

Five Madonnas are  honoured in Montegrano, a little village in South Italy. They are dif- ferentiated according to principles of topography or quality, and for  many of the inhabitants the connection between them and the biblical  mother of Christ is opaque to say the least.161 When a Montegrano  boy who had studied for the priesthood attempted to explain to an  old woman that there is only one Madonna, she laughed at him. “You  studied with the priests for eight years,” she said, “and you haven’t  even learned the differences between the Madonnas!”162 The context  leaves no doubt that the five different Madonnas are indeed perceived  as distinct and different personae.163 Anyone who has witnessed pro- cessions of the religious fraternities in a Spanish town at the annual  festival knows that the Jesus of one church simply is not the same as  the Jesus of the next.164 Nor, again, and indeed less so, is Maria.

Gen- erally, again, I agree with Cohen (preceding note). Asked why we should select the  modern Mediterranean as an exemplary model for ancient Greek phenomena (not, to  be sure, as a case of proved historical or ethnic continuity) he says: “The main reason  is that there is no other group of well-documented societies which manifest the same  patterns of social practices.” I have called this principle “matching codes of behaviour”  and applied it in Wife and Helpmate: Women of Ancient Athens in Anthropologial  Perspective, in: J.

The Madonnas are:  (1) the Madonna of Pompei, whose miracles are well-known in Montegrano; (2) the  Madonna of Carmin, whose feast is celebrated in a nearby town; (3) the Madonna of  Peace, who is honoured in Montegrano with a feast and with a statue erected after  World War I and to whom the mothers prayed for their sons at war; (4) the Madonna  of Assunta, the protectress of one of the Montegrano churches; and (5) the Madonna  Addolorata, most commonly identified with the mother of Christ. 164 As for late Antiquity, one can only guess what the author of the Christian defixio  Domne lobis (nobis) obt[i]me cabtuline (Capitoline) (AE 1939) and the parents of an  unbaptized baby, who thank Jesus, “the Lord of the Olympus” (Peter Cramer, Baptism  and Change in the Early Middle Ages, c.200–c.1150 (Cambridge 1993) with thanks to  Gabriel Herrmann) really mean. </page> <page sequence="45">  many gods: complications of polytheism 67 image of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, by arguing that “Our Virgin is  Communist.”165 In contemporary Greece it is just the same.166 Asked  by the resident anthropologist—there are few villages devoid of their  own anthropologist—whether the Hagios Georgios of their village  was the same as the St. Georges of other places, the locals declared:  “The Hagios Georgios we have here is not the same Saint who comes  from Cappadocia. Ours is from right here.”167 Likewise they explain  that there is “a local Hagia Paraskevi who is from here; not the Hagia  Paraskevi from outside.”168 And these saints are not even marked by  165 W.A.

As a result, even though the same divine figure reigned everywhere, the symbols  for different communities were distinctive, and each community could be said to have  its own Mary” (my italics). Compare a discussion in the Canterbury Tales: “Of all Our  Ladies I love best Our Lady of Walsingham. And I Our Lady of Ipswich,” as quoted  by K. Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (London 1971) 29. The plurality of  Our Ladies is obviously related to Maria’s topographic distribution as well as to her  many functions. See: J.

His reproduction of the text is glaringly contradicted by the  words as cited by Blum and Blum, which after “Ours is from right here” continue:  “He appeared here for the first time long ago, up on the rock where you can see that  his horse stood.” This cannot but refer to the saint himself. Which, of course, does   nothing to deny that icons are important tools to visualize the holy person, repre- sented by them, as Herzfeld argues. 168 Ibid. 324.

Their epithet, one might say, is an implied posses- sive pronoun.169 Now, these phenomena are not restricted to modern Greek folklore.170  In antiquity, the same region that boasts a ‘St George from right here’  housed a goddess named ‘Mother of the Gods from right here’ (Μήτηρ  Θεῶν Αὐτόχθων),171 as well as a Macedonian Dionysos.172 Incidentally,  169 Possessive pronouns—as we shall discuss more extensively later—can make all  the difference, witness modern Cretan curses like: “to hell with your Panaghia” or “to  hell with your Jesus.” Though I have drastically adapted the language to fit the occa- sion (the actual terminology is too coarse to handle), these blasphemic expressions  may still bewilder the non-native, given its allegedly monotheistic context (if not for  other reasons). Herzfeld, ‘Significance’ o.c. (above n. 167) and idem 1987, 157–170,  explains this ‘fragmentation’ of holy figures as a spontaneous, yet conscious, rejection  of the shared identity with one’s enemies, a segmentation or refraction of an identity  embodied in the common ethnic Greek awareness of having one god and one lan- guage. I am not sure whether the Cretans who utter these exclamations would find  this explanation enlightening. At any rate, the curses necessarily imply a clear differ- entiation between your Panaghia and mine. I do not know of similar ritual reviling of  another’s god(s) in antiquity. Occasionally one finds something of the sort: Eur. Hipp.  113, “Your Cypris, let her get lost” (Ɩὴν σὴν δὲ ƍύπριν πόλλ’ ἔγω χαίρειν λέγω). But  this does not concern identity and the attitude here leads to disaster.  170 Nor is this a Mediterranean privilege. A tiny congregation of the reformed  church in a Dutch village at last had discovered the real name of God and thus cre- ated their own God. That name was ‘Lord Ouch’ as revealed in a psalm, which in  their version began: “Heer Aai,” (Lord, ouch, . .) and that was the way he should be  addressed, while just simply God or Lord (“Heere Heere”) certainly was the name  of another—suspicious—imposter. The creation of this type of name is well-known.  Cf. Enzyklopädie des Märchen I (1977) s.v. Ach, Ah me, Och, Oh, Ohimé, Uff.

Glory and hate (“la gloire et  la haine”) were—in Louis Robert’s famous words—the emotions that  dominated the relations between Greek cities.175 Boasting the privi- lege of being the birthplace of—or better still, to have been founded  by—a god or hero was a favourite tool in these contests.176 Even so,  we observe that, in past and present, the aspects of place and of local  identities—here, there; ours, theirs—, either implied or expressed  explicitly by a topographical epithet, play a major part. Indeed, our  exposé has gradually shifted from epithets indicating function or qual- ity towards toponymical predicates, which, besides prevailing in the  173 Robert 1987, 359 ff., a unique and isolated Lydian claim on the goddess who is  often referred to as Μήτηρ Φρύγια.

But these are certainly not the only differentiators. If we now return to the calendar of Erchia, at first sight, there seems  to be nothing against conceiving the six gods with the name Apollo as  variant manifestations of the same god though functionally or topo- graphically distinguished by means of their respective epithets. Just  the same is the case with Zeus with his strictly functional epithets:  Ombrios (concerned with rain), Herkeios (protector of the court  and the house), Ktesios (“Zeus of possessions,” protector of house  and property), Polieus (protector of the city), Hikesios (protector of  the supplicants), Xenios (protector of the guests). The epithets may  be seen as devices to assign different qualities to one and the same  god. As could be expected, Vernant and his adherents fully endorse— and generalize—this orderly point of view: “Zeus’ unity is not that  of a single and unique person but of a power whose various aspects  may be manifested in different ways.”177 Similar attempts to preserve  a principle of unity while acknowledging a baffling cultic multiplic- ity abound in studies of ancient polytheism,178 as well as in modern  177 Vernant 1980, 99, where see his discussion of the various epithets as different  aspects of one god. Cf. p. 94: “He is a god in the strict sense of the word, a theos,  precisely because he is so many things at the same time—things connected with what,  to our eyes, are completely distinct or even opposed domains.” The same in Ver- nant 1990, 13: “Ce qui fait d’une Puissance une divinité, c’est qu’elle rassemble sous  son autorité une pluralité d’ ‘effets’, pour nous complètement disparates, mais que le  Grec apparente parce qu’il y voit l’expression d’un même pouvoir s’exerçant dans les  domaines les plus divers.” This phrase and the introduction of which it forms part  does not occur in the original English version: Greek Religion, in: ER 6 (1987) 99–118,  where see the long digression on Zeus with many, sometimes contrasting epithets, yet  being one. On the question: are Greek gods ‘powers’ or ‘persons’? (a question to which  we shall return in Ch. IV) see also: N. Loraux, What is a Goddess? in: P. Schmitt- Pantel (ed.), A History of Women in the West I (Cambridge Mass. 1992) 11–44, with  abundant literature. 178 Vernant 1980, 99, reserves this unified picture of Zeus (as in preceding note) to  (Homeric) myth whereas “when a god is worshipped, however, it is rather the aspect  of plurality that is stressed. The living religion of the Greeks knows Zeus not in one  single form but rather as many different Zeus, each with its own epithet peculiar to  the cult that links it with its own particular area of activity. In worship the important  thing is to address oneself to the Zeus that is suitable to the particular situation.”  This, however, as noticed before, comes very close to being at odds with the picture  sketched in the preceding note. Cf. Rudhardt 1958, 97: “Nous verrions la personnalité  de chacun (des dieux) se dédoubler, s’éparpiller en plusieurs divinités aux épithètes,  aux localisations, aux fonctions différentes et conserver pourtant au-delà de tous ces  aspects une insaississable unité, dont témoigne la permanence de leur nom.” Just so:  Pirenne-Delforge 1988, 142–157, espec. 142; Jost 1992, 34.

For instance the anthropologist who  tried to restore sense in modern Greek chaos: “There is one Panaghia  but she has many forms.”179 Not only modern intellectuals. We saw  Cicero scorn ‘the separatists’ among the Greek theologians and in Xen.  Symp. 8.9, Socrates says: Whether there is one Aphrodite or two, Ourania and Pandemos, I do  not know (οὐκ οȢδα). For even Zeus, who is believed to be one and the  same god, nonetheless has many epithets (καὶ γὰρ Ɖεɞς ὁ αὐτὸς δοκῶν  εȢναι πολλὰς ἐπωνυμίας ἔχει). The interesting point, however, is that Socrates does show concern  about the problem and even continues acknowledging the distinction  between Aphrodite Pandemos and Ourania, on the ground of their dif- ferent altars, temples and sacrifices (χωρὶς ἑκατέρʕ βωμοί τέ εἰσι καὶ  νεˍ καὶ θυσίαι)!180 As we have observed above, it is this latter separative position that  a majority of the believers in modern Italy, Spain and Greece would  endorse. They explicitly resist this pursuit of unity by theologians,  anthropologists and other intellectuals. For the first time, but not  for the last, we see ourselves confronted with the question of whose  viewpoint we are representing: our own, that of the Greeks? Of which  resolve or eliminate ambiguity. It is precisely the ambiguity inherent in the epithet  system that makes it such a satisfying vehicle for religious thought. It allows one to  appeal to a figure who is very specialized and relevant to one’s needs, if the epithet  is functional, or very close to hand, if it is topographic. And yet that figure also has  the power and dignity of one of the greatest Olympians” (with reference to Gladigow  1981, 1224 and 1228 f. who already said much the same). Even Mikalson 2005, who  defends a very ‘separative’ distinction between ‘poetic’ and ‘cultic’ identities, in his  most recent book makes statements such as (p. 34): “We might think of many of  these Athenas as essentially different deities offering quite different services, but the  Athenians brought them all together under the name of Athena.” And on Hermes  Chthonios versus ‘Ouranic’ Hermes (p. 39): “Hermes might seem to us two separate  deities (. . .). But the Greeks saw ‘both’ deities as Hermes, and the problems we have  categorizing them seem not to have troubled the Greeks.” Cf. briefly: E. Lévy, Peut-on  parler d’une religion grecque?

Of philosophers like Plato, of whom Isaiah Berlin, The Crooked  Timber of Humanity, 208) said that “the notion that One is good,  many— diversity—is bad is . . . deeply rooted in the Platonic tradition,”  and who perhaps would not object to calling gods ‘powers’? Or that  of a majority of the Athenian—or worse, the Greek—population, who  probably would have no inkling of what we are talking about?181 Are  they less interesting than philosophers or tragic authors? Not in the  eyes of historians,182 including the present writer, who would rather  endorse the words of Joseph Mitchell in his McSorley’s Wonderful  Saloon: The people in a number of the stories are of a kind that many writers  have got in the habit of referring to as “little people.” I regard this phrase  as patronizing and repulsive. There are no little people in this book. They  are as big as you are, whoever you are. This may be the right moment to pay attention to the important and  very relevant warnings concerning the study of Roman religion by  Rüpke 2007, 67, who argues that we should not try to impose our  bent for theological systematics on ancient religious practice “since  inconsistencies and ambivalences are inherent in any form of praxis.”  He also warns against giving undue preference to foregrounding texts, especially discursive, argumentative or systematiz- ing ones, as sources. Trying to regularize ancient religious practice like  181 I mean those Greeks whom Angelos Chaniotis has in mind when he writes:  “Bei den alten Griechen ging es vor allem darum: Was koche ich heute Abend, und  weniger um die Frage: gibt es einen idealen Staat?” (Kinderuniversitas. Mit Kindern  in der Wissenswelt, University Heidelberg). I hardly dare—but cannot resist—to refer  to A. Etzione, The Moral Dimension. Toward a New Economics (New York 1988) XI,  15, 139, cf. 145, who argues that people’s thoughts and acts tend to be subrational  because of limited intellectual capabilities, as quoted by Naerebout 1997, 319, who  adds: “If anything we tend to underestimate the differences in intelligence, skills and  proficiency: generally it is suggested that most individuals are clustered around the  average, while in fact all test results combine to show a gentle curve sloping towards  the minimum and the maximum. It is surprising that historians (and other analysts of  human society) seldom, if ever, refer to this basic fact. Apparently scholars often con- sider their own mental abilities as normative, probably without giving the issue much  thought.” Fortunately there was one great classical scholar who did acknowledge these  simple facts of life: A.D. Nock. See his considerations below p. 524. 182 Here the theory of “the Great” versus the “Little Traditions” (and their interac- tions) as introduced in the 1950s by the Chicago anthropologists Robert Redfield and  MacKim Marriott deserve more attention then they get from classicists involved in  the study of Greek religion.  </page> <page sequence="51">  many gods: complications of polytheism 73 this, so that it can be formulated as a ‘doctrine’, as a system of thought,  is basically to do theology. And he adds that questions about the religion of the common man  should not be answered with the help of a systematic formulation of  a merely implicit theology, but through a description of their practice.  Now, all this is just as true for Greek religion183 and it is this principle  that underlies not only the present chapter but this whole book, as well  as much of my earlier work. Hdt. 1.44 at first glance seems to sustain the unitarian position, yet  on second view rather undermines its universal validity. When King  Croesus learns that his son has been killed in an accident at the hand  of a guest who had found protection in his palace, he called on Zeus ‘Purifier’ (∆ία καθάρσιον), taking him as witness of  what he had suffered at the hands of the guest; he also called ‘Protec- tor of the Hearth’ (ἐπίστιος) and ‘Protector of Friends’ (ἑταιρήιος), with  these names addressing that very same god (τὸν αὐτὸν το˃τον ὀνομάζων  θεόν), calling [him] ‘Epistios because he had unwittingly entertained his  son’s murderer in his house, and calling [him] ‘Hetaireios’, because the  man he had sent to guard his son had turned out to be his bitterest  enemy.184 Once again there is an interesting point, namely that Herodotus takes  the trouble to emphasize that it is one and the same god Zeus,185 who  is invoked under three different epithets indicating three different  qualities or functions. I could not imagine clearer evidence that this  unity in diversity is not self-evident, either for the author himself or  for his readers. These texts are particularly important since they pro- vide an ancient Greek—emic (insider)—legitimation for our—etic  (outsider)186—questions. But we must not expect explicit or  unequivocal  183 Belayche 2010, 149, warns exactly against the same pitfall when she recom- mends: “The relationship between speculation and praxis requires us, therefore, to  pay attention to the nature of the documents that are cited.” 184 My translation is as literal as (barely) bearable. All translations I have seen—as  usually—imply heavy interpretation. Note that the Greek verb καλέω, like English ‘to  call’, denotes both ‘to call on’ = ‘invoke’ and to call = ‘to name’.  185 I am not the first to have been struck by the singularly explicit comment τὸν  αὐτὸν το˃τον ὀνομάζων θεόν in this text. Cf. Ph.-E. Legrand, Hérodote.

Different contexts may foster different interpretations, few  people were inclined to reflect, fewer to comment explicitly on such  issues as the difference between separative and unitarian views. The  fact that most texts are ambiguous on this point may appear regret- table at first sight, but on second thought may hide a particular mean- ing of its own. Let us have a look at a few epigraphical texts from the  imperial period, an era that, with all differences, is no less polytheistic  then the preceding one.187 It is impossible to decide whether one should read a lex sacra from  Pergamum188 with sacrifices to Zeus Apotropaios, to Zeus Meili- chios, to Artemis Prothyraia, to Artemis [. . . .] (∆ιὶ Ǹποτροπαίˎ, ∆ιὶ  Μειλιχίˎ, Ǹρτέμιδι Ɠροθυραίαι καὶ Ǹρτέμιδι [. . . .]) as addressing dif- ferent Zeuses and Artemides or the same gods under different names.189  And people would not be aware of any inherent problem. Conspicu- ously ambiguous and illustrative, however, is the instruction given by  the famous oracle of Apollo at Klaros to the inhabitants of Hierapolis  during a plague.190 They must sacrifice to the gods in heaven and in the  187 We should keep in mind that Greek polytheistic religion in its traditional form,  including foundation of temples continued its existence into the 5th c. AD. See: Ch.  Roueché, Aphrodisia in Late Antiquity, JRS Monograph 5 (1989); A.-V.

The same problem emerges in a defixio, published by D.R. Jordan in: Jordan e.a.  1999, 117, where the author curses the person “who has put a curse on him before  Hermes Eriounios or Katochos or Dolios or anywhere else.” These three epithets are  indeed typical of Hermes in defixiones. Here, however, the search for completeness as  discussed above may play a role. Moreover, the curious “anywhere else” may imply  diversity of residence of gods that are experienced as different. 190 2nd c. AD. G. Pugliese Carratelli, ASAA 41–2 (1963–4) 360; M.L.

Apollo Kareios, at home in Hierapolis, where he shares a temple with  another Apollo, namely the city patron Apollo Archegetes-Pythios,  is closely related with yet another Apollo, namely Helios Lairbenos,  and is of local Phrygian origin.194 As such, Apollo Kareios clearly  distinguishes himself in several respects, and particularly in iconog- raphy, from the ‘normal’ Delphic/Greek type of Apollo. The Klarian  Apollo, on the other hand, famous for his oracle, is clearly related (also  iconographically) with the great Greek Apollo, but (as may be seen  from numerous expressions) is very much an independent God with  a distinctly individual identity. The Hieropolitan patron god Apollo  Archegetes-Pythios is, as his name indicates, definitely conceived as a  clone of the great Greek (Delphic) Apollo. Despite all this, the Klarian  Apollo in this oracle claims an all-encompassing position by calling  the inhabitants of Hierapolis, who stem from Apollo Kareios, his own  191 These cumulative lists of the same god or different homonymous gods with dif- ferent local epithets bloom in the Imperial period notably in Asia Minor. Not only in  inscriptions: in his second Sacred Tale 18, Aelius Aristides sees Asklepios in a dream:  “He was at the same time Asklepios, and Apollo both the Klarian and he who is called  Kalliteknos in Pergamon and whose is the first of the three temples.” 192 This type of ritual is known from other Klarian oracles as well: collected by Parke  l.c. (above n. 190) and Merkelbach-Stauber o.c. (n. 190) nos. 8 and 9. For another  (Klarian?) oracle on a different plague-averting statue (of Artemis) see: F.

Here then, we perceive an outspoken ambiguity between  unity and diversity, characteristic of this type of listing.195 On the other  hand, neat and clear instances of unity are not hard to find either: the  curious Herakles Kallinikos “the one at the agora and at the harbour”  (ὁ ἐπὶ ἀγορʘ καὶ ἐπὶ λιμένι) at Kos196 is, on syntactic grounds, clearly  qualified as one single individual, with two sanctuaries. Finally, a Hellenistic funerary inscription from Oinoanda (2nd c.  BC) presents an interesting curse: “Let him be liable to (the wrath  of ) Leto, Artemis Ephesia, Artemis Pergaia, and Apollo” (ἔνοχος ἔστω  Λητˑ, Ǹρτέμιδι Ȇφεσίʕ, Ǹρτέμιδι Ɠεργαίʕ, Ǹπόλλωνι). It is difficult to  resist the feeling that these opposing pairs of Artemides are conceived  as consisting of two different deities.197 Louis Robert, for one, is explicit  on the differentiation of the many local Artemides in Asia Minor: That the deities were well kept apart in the minds of the believers is obvi- ous in a dedication from Panamara, where we find among other gods:  κα[ὶ] Ǹρτέμιδι Ɠελδεκειτίδι καὶ Λευκιανʧ καὶ Ǹρτέμιδι ƍωράζων καὶ  Ǹρτέμιδι Ȇφεσίʕ καὶ Ǹρτέμιδι Λευκοφρυηνʧ.198 195 Parke o.c. (above n. 190) 155: “Anyway the Clarian priesthood took occasion to  adopt a politely patronizing tone toward Apollo Kareios, while insisting on their own  prerogative.” Apollo seems to have a predilection for such ambiguities. In an oath text  from Dreros (Syll.3 527; I.Cret. I ix 1) we find an Apollo Putios (= Pythios) side by  side with an Apollo Delphinios, of which the first is the clone of the Delphic Apollo,  the second a local Apollo. I wrote “seems” for in the same inscription we encounter a  Zeus Agoraios next to a Zeus Tallaios. For the occurrence of numerous, mostly local,  Zeuses, especially in Crete, often in one inscription, see the indexes of I.Cret. 196 1st c. BC. M. Segrè, Iscrizioni di Cos I–II, edited by D.

They may but need not They may. In the first section of this chapter we have seen that those  who prayed to a god with many (topographical) epithets did not  necessarily doubt that it was only one and the same god whom they  addressed in their prayer. As a matter of fact, in cult hymns polyon- ymy is one of the most powerful instruments to emphasize the god’s  unity. The unity may be expressed disertis verbis, as in Aesch. PV 209  f. Θέμις καὶ Ɔαῖα πολλῶν ὀνομάτων μόρφη μία (Themis and Earth,  of many names but one form). Plato (Socrates) and Herodotus, in  various passages quoted earlier, agreed. Lazzarini, in her collection of  votive inscriptions of the archaic period,199 presents numerous dedica- tions which, though addressed to locally worshipped Olympian gods,  nonetheless name these gods with poetical epikleseis such as in the case  of Apollo: hekatebolos, argyrotoxos, pai Dios megaloio, having the typi- cally hymnic objective of testifying to the range of their powers and  the popularity of their worship. These are unequivocal references to  the cultural unity as embodied in the common heritage of the literary  works of Homer and Hesiod, the poets who, according to Herodotus, had bestowed upon the gods their appropriate epithets (τὰς ἐπωνυμίας),  distributing their powers and offices (τιμάς τε καὶ τέχνας διελόντες),  while also shaping (literally: ‘signalizing’) their appearance (καὶ εἴδεα  αὐτῶν σημήναντες).200 By this very reference to a theological or mythical koine the gods con- cerned are registered as participants in a universal pan-hellenic pan- theon. Here then, we detect a ‘Paris fashion’ of constructing a divine  world. However, we also noticed that Apollo Sminthios had acquired such  an autonomic status side by side with Apollo that as Apollo Sminthios  he was showered with lists of topographical epithets. Here both the  as Robert may tend to (mis)read a text according to his expectations. None of these  commentators proposes a date of the inscription. 199 Lazzarini 1976, 78–86. 200 Hdt. 2.53. Cf. Hom. Il. 15.187–193; Hes. Th. 112. For Xenophanes see Ch. III. </page> <page sequence="56"> 78 chapter one unity of the god Apollo (behind his wealth of epithets) and the unique- ness of the Apollo with the epithet Sminthios is demonstrated in an  unmistakable manner. And speaking about Apollo: epithets referring  to cult-places or festivals—Apollo Pythios, Delios, Apollo Karneios  etc.—firmly designate the god as owing at least part of his identity to  a place or an occasion. If, then, in a modern de facto polytheistic sys- tem ‘our’ Panaghia is not the same as the Panaghia of the next village,  it cannot be called reckless to at least consider the possibility that, in  an overtly polytheistic concept, the Apollo belonging to one place is  not necessarily—let alone “of course”—perceived as identical with the  Apollo who is at home in another local or cultic context. Take Apollo  Aguieus, very much the ‘Apollo from right here’, as his humble and  mundane, often aniconic statue201 can be found near doorposts, on  street corners and in market places, receiving a cordial salutation from  the local passers-by.202 His identification with the august, omniscient  and remote Apollo of Delphi, access to whom was only possible by  investing in a long trip, can be achieved only at the loftiest summits  of abstract theology.203 Which leads us to the second—alternative— option. 201 Which—another testimony of divine diversity—does not prevent an Aguieus  from becoming the ‘king’ and eponymous god of the Thracian city of Kallatis (IGR I  656, ἐπὶ βασιλέος Ǹπόλλωνος Ǹγυέος, with L.

III n. 219) not a single accla- mation invokes Apollo without his epithet Pythios, which clearly proves that locally  </page> <page sequence="57">  many gods: complications of polytheism 79 They may but need not. At the marketplace of ancient Corinth,   Pausanias 2.2.8 tells us, you could see three statues of Zeus “one without  surname, the second Chthonios, and the third they call Zeus Hypsistos  (The Highest)” (τὸ μὲν ἐπίκλησιν οὐκ εȢχε, τὸν δὲ αὐτῶν ƙθόνιον καὶ  τὸν τρίτον καλο˃σιν ɂψιστον).204 Note how the first article is neuter  and refers to the statue, while the other two are masculine and refer  to the two named gods who are represented in the statues. What do  we make of the trio at Corinth?205 What would Herodotus have made  of it? Three manifestations of one Zeus, three different Zeuses? How  would the Corinthians have referred to them? As ‘the three Zeuses’?206 this Apollo is viewed as a singular (and superior) Apollo as distinct from all other  Apollines. 204 Compare Paus. 8.22.2, who tells us that in Stymphalos the legendary Teme- nos founded three sanctuaries for the goddess Hera and gave her three epithets  (ἐπικλήσεις): child, wife and widow. Here obviously the unity of the three Heras is  articulated. Again of a different nature are the two images of Hera in the temple at  Samos that are referred to as ἡ θεός and ἡ θεὸς ὄπισθεν (“the one behind” [in the  opisthodomos?]) in the inscriptions, on which see: Scheer 2000, 133 f. in a chapter  on the hierarchy of different cult images of one god. On double cults and temples  of “a deity in two different aspects” see: T. Hadzisteliou Price, Double and Multiple  Representations in Greek Art and Religious Thought, JHS 91 (1971) 48–69, espec. 53.  On two temples for one god, one in the city and one in the chora of a community  see: M. Jost, Sanctuaires ruraux et sanctuaires urbains en Arcadie, in: Schachter 1992,  205–245, espec. 228 ff. A dedication to ‘Hera in the field’ (IG XIV 643, 550 BC) sug- gests that there was another temple for Hera in the City. This city was Sybaris accord- ing to an attractive suggestion by R. Lucca, șρα ἐν πεδίˎ: per la cultualità di Sibari,  in: L. Braccesi (ed.), Hesperìa 4. Studi sulla grecità da Occidente (Rome 1994) 49–52.  The sanctuary of this Hera ἐν ἀγρˑ (as she is called in Steph. Byz. s.v. ƕύβαρις) was a  place of immunity for slaves and possibly played a role in manumissions. 205 And what do we make of the enormous list of Zeuses as manifest in statues at  Olympia summed up by Paus. 5.22 ff., boasting: “I have enumerated the images of  Zeus with the greatest accuracy.” It is complicating that the statues are often simply  referred to as ‘Zeus’, not ‘the image/statue of Zeus’. People who do not refer to divine  effigies as statues but as gods are censured by Plut. Mor. 379C–D, but this ‘error’ is  common practice in Greek description: D. Clerc, Les théories relatives au culte des  images chez les auteurs grecs du IIe siècle après J.-C. (Paris 1915); Gordon 1979 = 1996,  espec. 7–10; Kassel 1983; D.

Paus. 2.24.3  explains the three eyes as referring to one Zeus who reigns in heaven, on earth and in  the sea: “So the artist, whoever he was, represented Zeus with three eyes, because it is  one and the same Zeus (τὸν αὐτὸν το˃τον θεόν. Note the identical expression in Hdt.  as cited above p. 73, with the same explicit emphasis on the oneness of the god) who  reigns in all the three realms of nature, as they are called.” See for ample bibliogra- phy of this Zeus triophthalmos: Pritchett 1998, 286.

One, from Athens reads “to the  Apollones” (Ǹπόλλωσιν). “Quid hoc sit non constat” (“What this is  supposed to mean is not sure”) wrote the editor Kirchner.207 This now,  to my mind, is a wonderfully apposite comment. An inscription from  Aspendos includes a dedication “to the Aphroditai” (Ǹφροδείταις),  another mentions “the Nemeseis,”208 and at Troizen Pausanias 2.31.5  saw an altar of the Themides (βωμὸς Θεμίδων). Terms such as Aph- roditai and Apollones suggest, to say the least, a plurality of separate,  though similar and homonymous, individuals.209 The Lindians at Rho- dos with “Damateres” most likely referred to a combination of two  different goddesses, who at Eleusis would be called Demeter and Kore,  locally referred to as (the two goddesses) τὼ θεῶ.210 The Despoinai  Enalios’ and gives some more instances in nos. 52 and 72. Triple representations of  one or three gods may have totally different settings: an entirely different triplicity in  visual art is three gods united in one statue, as for instance described by Philodemus;  head of Pan, body of Heracles, legs of Hermes (D. Sider, The Epigrams of Philodemos  [New York – Oxford 1997] 169 no. 30).  207 IG II2 1945, where Kirchner wonders “an significatur dedicatio deo Apolloni  sub diversis nominibus honorato?” Two Apollones on a relief: L.

On the Nemeseis of Smyrna, see: Hornum 1993, 11–14, and index s.v.,  with full bibliography on the different explanations of the duality. Confession texts  from Maeonia present several acclamations to ‘the Nemeseis’. See: H. Malay, EA 36  (2003) 16.

Simon, Doppelgöttinnen in Anatolien, Griechenland und Rom,  Eirene 31 (1995) 69–87. The phenomenon is not restricted to, but certainly typical of  Asia Minor in the Roman period. It reaches its acme in the Men- inscriptions: CMRDM  I 155: τρὶς θ[εοɞς] Μῆνας, and 156: Μῆνας τόν τε οὐράνιον καὶ τοɞς καταχθονίους.  Cf. Peterson 1926, 270. More recent examples: Petzl BIWK index s.v. Lawson 1910,  48 ff. records a prayer for rain from the mouth of an old wise-woman in modern  Greece, addressed to “the god above and the god below” (τὸν ἄνο θεὸ καὶ τὸν κάτω  θεό), but who could not recall the third one, the one who made it thunder. There  is an early testimony that evokes the same imagery of one god multiplying himself,  namely in Hes. Scutum 140 ff., where on the shield one god Phobos occurs four times,  once pictured in the centre with Eris on “his grim brow,” once in combination with  Homados, once together with Deimos as seconds of Ares, and once sitting himself on  the heads of the Gorgons.  209 And they do not belong to “that whole class of divine beings whose nature is to  appear as a collective and who are designated by the plural” (Burkert 1985, 173, in his  section 3.2. on ‘Societies of Gods’).

On Punic Cereres see below p. 110. 211 Despoina, although generally the cult title of Persephone (Henrichs 1976, 259  n. 16) is not Kore here. See: Jost 1985, 333–337 on this goddess, and 297–356 gener- ally on the complicated cultic identities of Arcadian Demeter and her circle (Kore,  Despoina, the Great Goddesses): “à Éleusis, les ∆ημήτερες désignent Déméter et  Koré du nom de la mèreŸ à Lykosoura, les deux déesses doivent leur nom commun  à Despoina” (334). There is also an altar for the Despoinai at Olympia (Paus. 6.15.4).  Note that at Italian Locri Persephone seems to lack any association with Demeter but  appears to have adopted several functions normally attributed to Demeter, as witness  the famous clay relief plaques: Sourvinou-Inwood 1978; J.M. Redfield, Locrian Maid- ens: Love and Death in Greek Italy (Princeton 2005). 212 Cf. an inscription in Lebadeia ʠΑρτέμισι Ɠραίαις (IG VII 3101).  213 The list of different explanations of the multiplication of this goddess as cited by  Hornum 1993 is frightening. 214 A.N.

Hadzisteliou Price, o.c. (above n. 204) 53 f., gives more evidence and lists dif- ferent kinds of double deities. The Roman Iunones as adduced by Usener 1986, 299,  are of a different nature, since every woman had her own Iuno just as every man his  Genius.  217 Sometimes, however, we do have explicit and unequivocal information. Hesiod  Cat. fr. 23a 26, for instance, makes Artemis Einodia (= Iphimedeia) a servant of— hence distinct from—the goddess Artemis, and in Cat. 216, Apollo Nomios (= Aris- taeus) is the son of Apollo. That we have landed here in the world of poetry does not  detract from the fact that apparently such double identities were conceivable to the  Greek mind. </page> <page sequence="60"> 82 chapter one Finally, Kallimachos offers a splendid example of how the two different  positions, the monistic and the pluralistic, may co-exist in the work of  one and the same author.218 In his Hymn to Apollo 69–71, he presents  the ‘unitarian’ idea: O Apollo, many call you Boedromios, many call you Klarios, you have  many names everywhere, but I call you Karneios, since this is an ances- tral custom.219 However, in Iambos 10 (Peiffer 200a) the other option comes to the  fore: All the Aphrodites—for the goddess is not one— are surpassed in wit by the one from Kastinia. (Ɩὰς Ǹφροδίτας—ἡ θεὸς γὰρ οὐ μία— ἡ ƍαστνιῆτις τˑ φρονεῖν ὑπερφέρει)220 So once more: they may, but need not. To put it provocatively, gods  bearing the same name with different epithets were and were not  one and the same,221 depending on their momentary registrations in  the believer’s various layers of perception. Theirs was a chameleonic  218 I owe these references to Ivana Petrovic.  219 The narrator comes from Cyrene, which was, according to legend, founded by  Apollo Karneios. Compare also the opening lines of the Hymn to Zeus: “But how  are we to sing him? As Diktaian or Lykaian? I hesitate between the two: each has its  champions. Zeus, they say, you were born on the heights of Ida, and then again Zeus  in Arcadia. Which ones are lying?” With this critical analysis Kallimachos is playing  with the fixed hymnic strategies of polyonymy.  220 The next line offers an explanation for this choice but, being in prose, must be the  work of a commentator: “Because she alone allows the sacrifice of swine” (which is not  as enlightening as one might wish). Such explicit enunciations that many homonymous  gods, worshipped at—and hence named after—different places, are in fact conceived of  as different personae are common in Hittite texts. At the end of a prayer addressed to  the ‘Weather god’ or to the ‘Sungoddess Hebat’ characterized by a long list of lands or  cities (the divine name being repeated every time with the new topographic predicate)  may end with the summary “to all the weathergods” or “to all the Hebats.” See G. Wil- helm in: Krebernik &amp; van Oorschot 2002, 69 f. See also below n. 318.  221 I used this expression in my 1999 lecture and am happy to find nearly the same  in Mikalson 2005, 37: “The deities of Greek poetry, in a sense, both were (by name,  physical appearance, and sometimes function) and were not (by local cult myths, ritu- als, and sometimes function) the deities whom each Greek personally worshipped.”  Mikalson in this first chapter, independently from my own research, briefly formulates  his view on problems of divine identities on which he made occasional notes in earlier  works (see below p. 525) and with which I very much agree. Cf. Auffarth 1994b, 19:  “Die Götter [in contradistinction to locally determined heroes] dagegen gibt es in fast  jedem Ort. Und doch sind es nicht die gleichen. Sie sind Teil des lokalen Pantheons,  das in jeder Polis wieder anders zusammengesetzt ist.” </page> <page sequence="61">  many gods: complications of polytheism 83 nature, with different aspects or indeed identities rising to prominence  and fading into the background in alternation, according to shifts in  perspective. The name Zeus may evoke an infinite sequence of images,  qualities and connotations, and the total of these qualities as expressed  by epithets together may construct the ‘sociogram’ of the god.222 How- ever, as the linguist Wallace Chafe223 argues: “at any given moment the  human mind can focus on no more than a small segment of everything  it knows.” Both in speech-acts and in perception we have to allow for  “sequences of different foci of consciousness.” Accordingly, I would  suggest that various different conceptions of the unity or diversity of  gods with one name and different epithets or different residences are  stored in the mind of a person, but that it is the shift in context— literary, social, regional—(or on the level of education)224 that triggers  a specific focus.225 As Paul Veyne once wrote: “a worshipper who made  a vow in pious affection did not think of the mythological biography of  the god to whom he prayed for assistance. But if questioned he would  222 “Die Summe der kultischen Epitheta des einzelnen Gottes stellt so etwas wie ein  Soziogramm der kultischen Realität dar, näher an den Interessen der Glaübigen als  mythologische Spekulationen” (Gladigow 1983, 13). 223 Chafe 1994, 140. Idem, The Deployment of Consciousness in the Production of  a Narrative, in W. Chafe (ed.), The Pear Stories: Cognitive, Cultural, and Linguistic  Aspects of Narrative Production (Norwood NJ 1980) argues that the origin of this lies  in human evolution. Each focus of consciousness embraces just enough information  to be effective in terms of the human organism’s basic needs. We shall return to this  phenomenon in Ch. II. It is closely related to the principle of ‘information overload’:  as a rule people make choices and decisions without being able to analyse all available  information (D. Kahneman, P. Slovic &amp; A. Tversky (edd.), Judgment under Uncer- tainty: Heuristics and Biases [New York 1982]).  224 I hesitate, though, as will be clarified in Ch. II, to make an all-too-rigorous  distinction between ‘popular’ religion and the religion of poets, historians and   philosophers.  225 In the words of Ph. Borgeaud, Manières grecques de nommer les dieux, Col- loquium Helveticum 23 (1996) 19–36, espec. 23: “Un dieu, en effet, c’est toujours des  dizaines d’aspects et de fonctions partagés et contrastés avec ceux d’autres dieux.  Un dieu, tel qu’il apparaît dans la relation rituelle, constitue donc un point nodal,  conjoncturel et problématique. C’est dans la relation concrète de l’interlocuteur à la  puissance, que s’opère le classement du panthéon, et donc de nomination.” This free  alternation of identities is not restricted to polytheistic Greece. In a discussion of Zeus  of Carmel/of Heliopolis (modern Baalbek) F. Millar, The Roman Near East, 31 BC–AD  337 (Cambridge Mass.–London 1993), 270, says that the god was “whatever his wor- shipper said he was.” Cf. ibid. 249 on Dolichenus: “His worshippers could literally  make of him what they would.” T. Kaizer (ed.), The Variety of Local Religious Life in  the Near East in the Hellenistic and Roman Periods (Leiden 2008) focusses on similar  phenomena. </page> <page sequence="62"> 84 chapter one speak on this mythical aspect.”226 And I would argue that Greeks (like  other representatives of traditional, ‘pre-modern’ cultures) used to  focus on that particular segment of divine identities that was contex- tually marked or momentarily required, while simultaneously clos- ing their eyes to different, rival and often incompatible images in the  sociogram of the god in question. A way out In Appendix II, on ‘unity or diversity’, the reader will find a summary  and an assessment of a debate on the type of polytheistic complexi- ties under discussion between two modern scholars who hold radically  contrasting views, each contesting the other’s view as incompatible with  her/his own (correct) one. In other words both of them take a firm and  exclusivistic stance in our modern Western ‘separative cosmology,’227  which does not allow two contrasting incompatible truths to co-exist  peacefully and which has no room for ambiguities. Contrarily, I would  propose that one might, just might, consider a third option.228 This  226 Veyne 1986, 280 in my translation. Cf. below p. 85. This is one instance of  what Veyne 1983 coined ‘Balkanisation of the brain’, being the way in which differ- ent ‘beliefs’ occurred side by side, in unconscious competition but without denying  each other’s right of existence. Similar views had been developed long before in other  disciplines. William James, The Principles of Psychology II (New York 1890) 277 ff. in  a section on “The various orders of reality,” speaking of ‘sub-universes’ writes: “The  popular mind conceives of all these sub-worlds more or less disconnectedly; and when  dealing with one of them forgets for the time being its relation to the rest.” The sociol- ogist Alfred Schütz, Collected Papers I, The Problem of Social Reality (The Hague 1962)  207–259, “On multiple realities”, prefers to speak of “finite provinces of meaning”  but means the same. Recent research suggests that people are able to appeal simulta- neously to different “non-linguistic chunked mental models.” Thus R.G. D’Andrade,  Schemas and Motivation, in: R. D’Andrade &amp; C. Strauss (edd.), Human Motives and  Cultural Models (Cambridge 1992) 23 f., who uses the expression “parallel distributed  processing.” Along these lines, in one of his revolutionary papers, Maurice Bloch,  Language, Anthropology and Cognitive Science, Man 26 (1991) 183–198, espec. 191,  argues that knowledge is organised in a way that is not “language-like.” Knowledge  is made accessible “through a number of processing units which work in parallel and  feed in information simultaneously.” All these approaches, as well as others, will be of  much avail in the present book.  227 I adopt here terms and concepts introduced by Oudemans &amp; Lardinois 1987 and  will return to this in several chapters of this book. 228 As noted time and again I do not claim originality in this respect. See for instance  Buxton 1994 as quoted below in Appendix II, n. 25, who on p. 196, arguing for the  ‘provocative ambiguity’ of myths, in his turn acknowledges indebtedness to “the super- lative introduction to Versnel 1990.” So in brief: we agree. Cf. also Jost 1992, 15, who  rightly stresses that side by side with the common imagery of the pantheon, largely an  inheritance from the past, the cultic personalities of gods differed widely from place to  </page> <page sequence="63">  many gods: complications of polytheism 85 implies venturing for a moment into the Greek ‘interconnected cos- mology’, which does not compulsively avoid ambiguities, and accept- ing that (the) Greeks had to live with two (or more) indeed mutually  exclusive realities and yet coped with the inherent paradoxes and incon- sistencies. There cannot be any doubt that mythical and (local) cul- tic personae of a god might diverge dramatically. While attending a  tragedy,229 admiring a mythical scene in visual art, or listening to a  mythical tale, one would (in fact one was contextually forced to) iden- tify with a world of mythical identities that were ingrained in every- body from early childhood. This temporarily determined the focus and  wiped local identities off the screen. When confronted in cult with the  local and functionally specialized—and, through their nearness, more  familiar—gods with their surnames, the focus shifted and temporarily  pushed the imagery of the mythical god to the background. Indeed  as Veyne230 wrote: “a mental cleft separated gods as mythical figures  from the gods as objects of the piety of the believers.” Yet (the) Greeks  managed to cope with these two religious realities, both stored in their  place. Finally, poets and thinkers adapt the gods to their own concepts of the universe.  “Ce sont donc des approches divers des dieux et des héros qu’il faut confronter si l’on  veut dépasser l’image stéréotypée d’un panthéon simple et cohérent.” One must all the  more regret the deafening silence on the at the time refreshing viewpoints of Rowe  1976, 48. Discussing the opposition between Guthrie, who saw a contradictory chaos  in the many aspects of Apollo, and Walter Otto’s unitarian vision: “In Apollo all the  splendour of the Olympic converges,” Rowe finds that Otto was involved in just the  same type of exercise as Hesiod, namely that of attempting to mitigate, in a creative  way, the apparent chaos and disunity of Greek religious ideas. He concludes: “I am  not sure therefore that Guthrie’s view that there are unresolved contradictions in the  character of Apollo, or of Dionysos, is necessarily mutually incompatible with Otto’s  attempt at conciliation; for they simply belong to different spheres of discourse.” In  general terms Feeney 1998, 23, quoting Bloch 1989, 109, writes: “It is by no means  clear that we may view any culture a ‘historically constructed system of cognition  which is coherent, all-encompassing and non-individual’.”  229 Which is not the same as fully appreciating or even so much as fully understand- ing the text. R.W. Wallace, Speech, Song and Text, Public and Private, in: Eder 1995,  199–217, espec. 204, on the basis of a host of contemporary testimonies (not restricted  to Aristophanean comedy!) concludes that: “In the second half of the fifth century the  Athenians came to realize that, despite the power and the beauty of their traditional  poetry, in fact they did not actually understand it.” Cf. A.W. Pickard-Cambridge,  The Dramatic Festivals of Athens (Oxford 19682) 261: “It may be that the obscurity  imparted to the words of the tragic choruses was one, among others, of the causes of  its rapid decline in the fourth century. Poets might not care to compose what their  hearers could not follow.” 230 “Un abîme mental séparait les dieux comme figures mythologiques et les dieux  comme objets de la piété des fidèles:” Annuaire Collège de France 76 (1976) 371.

Different and the same.  We have seen it before and will see it time and again. In the domain  of religion (the) Greeks had no insurmountable problems with dou- ble identities up till the moment that they were questioned on it. The  questions, however, are ours. One of the theses added to a Dutch dis- sertation232 runs: “Whoever finds chaos has been on the lookout for  structure.” This is very true and indeed typical of our paradigm. Its  corollary is worse. When, while on the lookout for order, we run up  against a contradiction (which is another word for chaos in our para- digm) it is our late-modern craving to remove the inconsistency as  quickly and radically as possible. We will amply return to this modern  epidemic in our following chapters. Contrarily, the anthropologist S.R.  Barrett defines contradiction as “the basis of social life.”233 Whoever  cannot accept that living with contradictions is possible, for instance  231 And so it could happen that when the best of the workmen involved in the  construction of the Propylaea was terribly injured and given up by the doctors, the  goddess (ἡ θεός = the Athena herself ) appeared in a dream, saved him, and that next  Perikles erected a statue for Athena Hygeia at the place where she had already an older  altar (Plut. V.Per. 13.12–13) whose base may have been found with the inscription:  “The Athenians to Athena Hygieia” (A.E. Raubitchek, Dedications from the Athenian  Acropolis [Cambridge Mass. 1949] no. 166). There we find her flanked by a statue of  Hygieia, who may have been an offshoot of the same Athena Hygieia and must have  been very difficult to keep apart from her. See on this dilemma: Graf 1985, 216 f.; Chr.  Auffarth, in: Eder 1995, 353 ff. Things are not so simple as some modern scholars  would like to have them!  232 G.

Instead the emphasis will be on a world of ‘cluttered  contradictions’, themselves at times messy, loosely integrated, ambiguously located,  and devoid of ultimate rational design.

These introductory reflections confront us with a first instance of  ambiguity resulting from a multiple-perspective view and the con- comitant different layers of discourse. Not the last, since it will be  one of the recurrent issues in the following chapters. At any rate, the  complications emerging from the ‘multiperspectiveness’ introduced so  far, should give cause to at least some reserve concerning attempts  at devising one monolithical overall structure in Greek polytheism.  Such a device may be relatively easy to accomplish with one Zeus, one  Apollo, and one Athena. However, when it comes to accommodat- ing dozens of gods with one name but displaying mutually discor- dant features as inter alia manifest in their respective epithets, into  one universal scheme, problems become insurmountable. Greeks may  have tried to create unity and order in the diversity of religious con- ceptions, striving to compose a menu of these ingredients, the Greeks  mostly improvised à la carte. The essential question, however, is whether we should (dis)qualify  a menu à la carte as chaos. Jonathan Z. Smith once wrote: “The his- torian’s task is to complicate, not to clarify.” I suggest we accept this  challenge. For we have not nearly finished our quest for complications.  They appear to emerge ever more forcefully as inevitable companions  of the devices for structuring the pantheon to which we shall now  turn. 234 In Science (December 4th 1998) attention is drawn to the co-existence of two  dominant features of consciousness. One is ‘unity’. A conscious experience can consist  only of one indivisible ‘scene’, as the human mind cannot pay attention to two dif- ferent experiences or propositions simultaneously. The other is ‘differentiation’: each  stage of consciousness consists in the omission of all other states of consciousness.  The two potentially incompatible features rest in different parts of the thalamus and  cortex, one regulating perception and cognition, the other steering memory, assess- ment, opinion, planning. Let us just recall these two qualities of the human mind.  They are good to think with.  235 I discussed and amply used this theory in Versnel 1990, introduction. </page> <page sequence="66"> 88 chapter one 3. Creating Order: Taking Place 1. “The gods who dwell in our city” To say “Our Mother of the Gods is autochthonous; she is not the same  as the one from Asia Minor,” is an act of disarrangement undermin- ing the greater unity suggested by the common name. But at the same  time it implies a new arrangement, a different order in another per- spective. One of the questions asked to establish Athenian citizenship  in the examination of a candidate for the archonship was whether he  had “an Apollo Patroios and a Zeus Herkeios, and (if so) where these  sanctuaries were located” (εἰ ἔστιν αὐτˑ Ǹπόλλων πατρˑος καὶ Ɖεɞς  ἑρκεῖος, καὶ πο˃ τα˃τα τὰ ἱερά ἐστιν).236 The two gods, clearly discon- nected from their Olympian namesakes and their pantheon, appear to  play a major role in the construction of another type of meaningful  coherence: the cultural definition of one’s place of belonging. It is time  to pay more attention to this aspect because here we descry a first  rudimentary, natural and unsophisticated way of creating order in a  potential chaos. In a late fourth century decree from Kolophon237 the inhabitants wish  to extend the city wall “to enclose the old city within the same wall as  236 [Arist.] Ath. Pol. 55.3, with P.J.

Apparently gods (and heroes)240 have domiciles, residences, in addi- tion or as opposed to their mythically determined abode on Mount  Olympus or their politically centralized (pan-)Hellenic cult centres.  To disregard the watershed between these categories is a guaranteed  recipe for misunderstanding the working of Greek polytheism. Gods  are omnipresent in one perspective, while from a different point of  view they live on Mount Olympus. In yet another context, however,  they are supposed to live ‘right here’ in their local sanctuaries. Mod- ern scholars’ difficulties in coming to terms with the (psycho)logical  inconsistencies involved can be exemplarily illustrated with a passage  written by such an admirable scholar as W.K.

Comparably, as Hdt. 1.26 reports, during an attack on their city  the Ephesians dedicated their city to the goddess of the city by connecting her temple  to the city by means of a rope. And with success, as Polyaenos Strat. 6.50 testifies. 239 The verb (together with others) is a fixed terminus to indicate ‘have in posses- sion’ or ‘be at home somewhere’. See: Keyssner 1932, 77 f., and LSJ s.v. Barré 1983,  93 ff., admits that the verb may have both meanings but prefers ‘to dwell in’ as the  correct meaning in the oath of Hannibal and Philippos (see below. p. 108). In the cult  inscriptions of Lydia and Phrygia of the imperial period, on the other hand, the notion  of ‘having power over’ is arguably dominant: P. Herrmann, Men, Herr von Axiotta,  in: S. Sahin (ed.), Studien zur Religion und Kultur Kleinasiens. Festschr. F.K. Dörner  I (Leiden 1978) 415–423, espec. 421 ff.; Pleket 1981, 174–178; S. Hübner o.c. (above  n. 152) 187 f.; Belayche 2006. See also below Ch. III n. 180. 240 At first sight, the phrasing of this inscription might suggest that there is a dif- ferentiation between all the gods on one side and the heroes who live amongst us on  the other. As the abundant parallels adduced below indicate this is most probably not  intended. See further below nn. 280 and 284. </page> <page sequence="68"> 90 chapter one  epiphanies of deities presupposed that they did not remain permanently  in their temples. Their home was on Mount Olympos. What we see here is a desperate attempt to disentangle and split up  a ‘polytopic’ conception of divine residence into separate, mutually  exclusive, images of divine commuting between alternating abodes.  However, in the practice of religious imagery the Greeks lived—and  coped—with an unravelled knot of synchronous but in their synchrony  incompatible notions. Albeit all simultaneously true, they are not—and  cannot be—simultaneously operative. In other words, we have here an  exemplary instance of “sequences of different foci of consciousness.” First of all, explicit attribution of epidemia and apodemia is restricted  to only few gods, especially in the context of oracular activity.241 Apollo’s  epidemia in the form of his annual return from the Hyperboreans (or  other distant places but not from the Olympus) was every year ritually  celebrated in his cultic centres at Delos and Delphi. About departure, on  the other hand, no word.242 Although an arrival logically presupposes a  preceding period of absence, as a rule this apodemia is not ritually vali- dated. Several gods used to (re-)appear annually, especially in springtime,  without having performed a marked act of departure before.243 No closure  of sanctuaries,244 no suspension of prayer and sacrifice. Although absent if  viewed from one perspective, the god nonetheless is and remains  present  241 Schol. C 1 (ii, 49 Pf ) ad Call.

To make  sense of all this, we should abandon the image of commuting gods and  open our eyes to the mental reality of shifting foci.246 Epiphanies, for that matter, far from proving a structurally preced- ing temporary withdrawal from the local temple, rather testify to the  complexity of a multifocal imagery of divine residence. Similar to the  focal imbalance between epidemia and apodemia, epiphany reports—in  accordance with the term epiphaneia—are exclusively concerned with  the place of appearance. They have no interest in and therefore rarely  mention the place of the god’s departure.247 And the places where they  appear may vary far and wide. “Gods may roam our cities in guise of  strangers from afar,” we read in Homer. Dionysos, during his jour- ney from India, appeared in epiphany wherever he arrived, the Dios- kouroi came to the rescue of people in peril all over the world. On the  other hand, Apollo emphatically manifested himself in his own temple  through epiphanies of various kinds in 279, as did Artemis Leukophry- ene in Magnesia 207, and Athena in her own temple at Lindos (early  5th c. BC), as well as many others.248 As we shall discuss in Chapter  V, while Asklepios’ epiphaneiai prevail as a standard phenomenon in  his own sanctuary at Epidauros,249 the god also frequently appeared at  other places not connected with his cult. One night he was unable to  come to his sanctuary at Troizen because he was busy in Epidauros,250  and so he turned up in Troizen only the next night. In the final part of  245 This is apparent from precisely the apodemia of Apollo from Delphi. His  ‘absence’ does not prevent him from giving oracles when necessary (see the scholion  quoted above n. 241) but “serves rather to provide a convenient excuse for those occa- sions on which the oracle did not prove correct,” thus B.K. Braswell, A Commen- tary on the Fourth Pythian Ode of Pindar (Berlin etc. 1988), ad l.5 (p.66). So, too,  L.R. Farnell (as cited by Pritchett) on Pind. Pyth. 4.5, and P.A. Bernardini, Pindaro.

They are however of a different nature than the average (cultic) epiphany.  248 See my Epiphaneia forthcoming.

Nock translated  as “the constant visitation to do miracles,” but which certainly implied his habit to  appear, in visible form or in dreams. 250 The text has literally “because he did not have his epidemia there (οὐκ  ἐπιδαμο˃ντος αὐτο˃) but was in Epidauros.” See Ch. V, p. 403. </page> <page sequence="70"> 92 chapter one Isyllos’ paean to Apollo and Asklepios,251 the god “came to the rescue  of the Spartans from Epidaurus,” where, apparently, he was supposed  to live, as also appears from the fact that he ordered a patient to wait  there for his return.252 What these testimonies show is not that gods travel from Olympos  to different places, but that they freely manifest themselves in corporeal  visibility at any place that accords with the expectancy of the believers,  not surprisingly very much including places where they are deemed to  have their fixed domicile.253 Their apparitions in or around their own  temples signify that their ‘normal’ presence is now manifesting itself in  a singularly miraculous and specifically divine fashion. If we consider  the notion of ‘commuting,’ this notion should not be taken in terms of  gods in the act of changing place,254 but just as in the case of epidemia,  in terms of perspectival shifts in the mind of the believer. It depended  on his/her needs and preferences, to decide whether a god was present  251 E. Diehl, AL II 6 113–118; Furley and Bremer 2001, no. 6.4E. 252 Comparably, Herakles, though “he performed marvellous deeds (θαυμαστά) at  Gadira (. . . . .), has often been seen playing with balls of Heraklean proportions in his  own temple. (. . . .) The noise which they create is audible and they are moved by him  from one side of the building to the other” (Aristid. Or. 40 [Herakles] 12 f.). 253 Cf. C. Higbie, The Lindian Chronicle and the Greek Creation of their Past (Oxford  2003) 264, discussing expressions of epiphaneia of Asklepios in Epidaurus and Athena  at Lindos: “In neither instance does the phrase refer to any specific appearance of the  god, but rather expresses an understanding that the divinity, in some sense, resides in  the sanctuary, and permeates it with his or her presence.” Yet, in the first epiphaneia  recorded on the fourth column, we see the same goddess Athena who is normally  residing in her temple, also appear in a dream and travel to her father Zeus to ask  him a favour for her city.  254 Although gods may travel. Poseidon in Od. 1. 22 ff., was abroad and hence could  not hear what the gods discussed on mount Olympos. Yet, if he wished,—that is, if  a literary or religious context required it—a god could hear wherever he happened  to be (Il. 16.514 ff. δύνασαι δὲ σɞ πάντοσ’ ἀκούειν; Aesch. Eum. 297: κλύει δὲ καὶ  πρόσωθεν Ɇν θεός, cf. 397; Ar. Nub. 269–274. See commentaries for parallels). On  the other hand, to praise Apollo Grannus as the god ‘who listens to prayers always  and everywhere’ (SEG 35.589: αἰεὶ καὶ πανταχο˃ ἐπηκόˎ) hints at the shortcomings  of other gods in this respect, as Chaniotis 2010, 137 notes. And a god could visit his  local temple in order to be out of reach of divine communication from Olympos, as  Demeter did in Eleusis. See Richardson 1974, ad l. 27 ff. for further inconsistencies  of this type. Cf. Hera, who kept herself far from the abode of Zeus and “stayed in her  temples where many pray and delighted in her offerings” (H.Apollo 347–8). There is  a good introductory discussion of such excrescences of anthropomorphism and their  limits in Rudhardt 1958, 80–101. </page> <page sequence="71">  many gods: complications of polytheism 93 in his temple, 255 or sojourned on Olympos,256 or vaporized into a more  abstract imagery of omnipresence.257 There is a fine illustration of convergence and differentiation of  these three types of localisation in one story about gods and heroes  as summachoi in the naval battle at Salamis (480 BC). Hdt. 8.64.2 tells  how the Greeks decided to pray to the gods and to call upon the Aiakides [sons of Aiakos, here  including Aiakos himself] to help them as summachoi. And so they did:  they prayed to all the gods (πᾶσι τοῖσι θεοῖσι), and from right there,  i.e. from Salamis (αὐτόθεν μὲν ἐκ ƕαλαμῖνος), they called up Aiax and  Telamon, and in order to fetch Aiakos (ἐπὶ δὲ Αἰακόν) and the other  Aiakides they sent a ship to Aegina. Here we have it all: “the gods,” without specification and not topo- graphically determined, are supposed to be omnipresent; Aiax and  Telamon being residents of Salamis are self-evidently present258 and  immediately available as allies, and the Aiakides are, in a more cor- poreal imagery (most probably in imagine)259 fetched by ship.260 The  255 The temple was his house (αὐλαί: Eur. Ion 184–6; οἰκήματα: Hdt. 8.144), where  he lived (οἰκοδομεῖν: Ar. Av. 611–615, and see commentaries). All this of course, is  also connected with the vexed problem of the equation of agalma and god. See above  n. 205 and below n. 389. 256 The two images alternate when the knise of the Olympian sacrifice rises to heaven  to feed the gods, while after the sacrifice a trapeza is laid and heaped with titbits where  the same gods are supposed to have a bite. On this extensively below Chapter IV. 257 It should be noted that the invocations to come and listen, as we find them  stereotypically in prayers, have their focus on the speaker’s presence, and are not  indicative of the place where the god is supposed to be at the moment of prayer (cf.  Scheer 2001, 36). Significantly, Zeus is the only god who is never asked to come, but is  supposed to act from his central position (West ad Hes. Op. 2, p. 138), which concurs  with the fact that, in the older Greek cities, Zeus was the only Olympian god who was  denied the privilege of being a city-patron. See: Brackertz 1976, 93 f. 258 At Hdt. 5.66.2, Kleisthenes, for this reason, calls Aiax “a neighbour and an ally”  (ἀστυγείτονα καὶ σύμμαχον). 259 So How and Wells ad loc. Cf. Pritchett 1979, 15–18. That this is well conceivable  may appear from Hdt. 5.80: The Thebans, pressed hard by the Athenians, asked help  from the Aeginaetans, who replied that they would send the Aiakidai (τοɞς Αἰακίδας  συμπέμπειν) in aid. As these heroes proved of little avail, the Thebans returned the  Aiakidai (τοɞς Αἰακίδας ἀπεδίδοσαν), which presupposes a presence in the form of  images. See: Van Compernolle o.c. next note. 260 In 8.83.2–84.2 that ship arrived back just at the moment that the battle was  to begin and the Aeginaetans contend that it was this ship that opened the battle.  Later it was told (Plut. Them. 15.1) that the Aiakides had been seen in the air join- ing the Athenians in their fight. With this the Aiakides belong to a fixed type of  divine or heroic promachoi/summachoi, who are called upon (ἐπικαλεῖσθαι) and are  believed to fight in person together with their mortal supplicants. Just as Diod. Sic. 8  </page> <page sequence="72"> 94 chapter one author of a hymn for Demetrios Poliorketes (290 BC) that we shall  discuss in our final chapter, probably inspired by Epicurean theol- ogy, focuses on the negative aspects of divine distance (in an unde- termined way) and nearness (in the form of statues) and prefers the  living  Demetrios, because he is present: Now know that other gods are far away, or have no ears or don’t exist  or do not care about us. But thee, we see here present: not wood, nor  stone but real to the bone. It is not the gods who decide where they are or from where they arrive.  It is the mortal manipulator, who may even claim the authority to  decide who is god and who is not. After this brief preliminary introduction into religious multiper- spectiveness—an issue that will be at the heart of this book—we must  return to the topic broached in this section, that of gods in a local  perspective, as ‘our’ gods. No testimony is more explicit than a votive  inscription to the goddess Nemesis at Rhamnous: “to this goddess here  who owns this sanctuary here” (θεᾶι τῆιδε ȏ τόδ’ ἔχει τέμενος).261 Did  the person who commissioned this text ever ponder the possibility  that his goddess occasionally might move to another place (includ- ing Mount Olympos)? The same emphatic deictic locative is used by  Socrates during an outing in the countryside,262 where he prays: “Dear  Pan and you other gods who dwell in this place” (Ʉ φίλε Ɠάν τε καὶ  fr.32 and Iustin. 20.2 f. tell that the citizens of Locri Epizephyrii, having heard from  the Spartans that the only summachoi they had on offer were the Tyndarides, sailed  back home having placed a kline on board as if transporting (and entertaining) the  gods.

The other gods referred to here appear to be the  Nymphs, who are, like Pan, often pictured as goddesses in close vicinity  or ‘here’.263 “You who live here in our land” (ἔγχωροι κατοικο˃σαι) is  how they are addressed in a formula of a magical handbook.264 We have touched here on an essential feature of Greek polytheism,  with far-reaching implications. Apollod. Bibl. 3.14.1. tells us that in the time of Kekrops, they say, the gods decided to take possession  of cities in which each of them should receive his own peculiar wor- ship (ἐπὶ τούτου, φάσιν, ἔδοξε τοῖς θεοῖς πόλεις καταλαβέσθαι, ἐν αἷς  ἔμελλον ἔχειν τιμὰς ἰδίας ἕκαστος). Divine division of timai: every (major) god his city—that is the briefest  summary of current theories concerning city-gods or patron gods. The  image of gods as city patrons, however, is mythical/theoretical rather  than evidential.265 An Athenocentric bias in our sources may obfuscate  the fact that often the patron divinity escapes identification, that some  cities do not seem to have had a patron god(dess) at all, or that else- where several gods may have claimed that position.266 263 Cf. ibid. 230b; 238c; 241e; 263d.

Motte, Le pré sacré de Pan et des  Nymphes dans le Phèdre de Platon, AC 32 (1963) 460–476. Pan (side by side with the  Nymphs) appears emphatically as a local ‘Pan here’ in Menander’s Dyskolos. In v. 413  Sikon, reacting to a mention of Pan, asks τουτονὶ λέγειςŸ whereupon Getas answers:  το˃τον. In 663 Knemon is called τˑδε γείτων τˑ θεˑ.

Jordan, Eulimene 1 (2000) 130 f., from heavily cor- rupted curse texts of late antiquity. For invocations to local gods, cf. in a letter on  papyrus (P.Tebt 413,3, 2nd–3d c. AD): “Every day I pray for your health to the gods  here” (τοῖς ἐνθάδε θεοῖς); P.Oxy 935: “Pausanias to his father Julius Alexander. Before  all else I pray for your health and I make devotion on your behalf before the gods of  the region . . .”  265 That is, as far as the classical period is concerned. In later times, especially in  Asia Minor, we see cities claiming that they are both under protection and in the  power of one great god. See above n. 239 and Chaniotis 2010, 134 with n. 91, for a  range of epithets stressing the presence of a divinity in a village, city or region. 266 See: Brackertz 1976; S.

VH 12, 61, relates that in 379 BC the citizens of Thurii decided by  vote in their assembly that the Windgod Boreas—who had destroyed  the fleet of the enemy—would be a citizen of the city and they allot- ted him a house and a piece of land, founded an annual festival for  him, and called him euergetes (benefactor).267 The Athenians, for their  part, decided to adopt this god as a κηδεστής, “a relative/son in law.”268  Comparably, one of the two Dionysoi in the city of Heraea in Arcadia  was called polites.269 Gods as honorary citizens270 and owners of land  and house, that is the ultimate expression of local inclusion in the  world of ‘ours’—a “naturalization” in the words of Detienne. Likewise,  the inhabitants of Thebes call on the θεοὶ πολῖται for help (Aesch.  Sept. 253).271 The preponderance of the notion of sumpoliteia between  god(s) and men may appear from the fact that the Stoa, in a later period,  exploited it to explain the creation of the kosmos, namely as inspired  by divine desire “that the kosmos would be a sumpoliteia for gods  95 [Stuttgart 1995]) 201–210, refines Cole’s views, doubts the ubiquity of gods as city  patrons, and warns against an all too dominant picture of the polis as a constitutive  element of religion (as presented i.a. by Sourvinou-Inwood 2000a and b). 267 A. Jacquemin, ƅƒƔƈΑƕ ƒ ΘƒƗƔƌƒƕ, BCH 103 (1979) 189–193, presents a very  good discussion of the purpose and meaning of this, underlining that πολίτην εȢναι is  the standard expression in secular decrees on granting citizen rights to a non-Athe- nian. Cf. Detienne 1986, 52, and in: Detienne &amp; Sissa 1989, 159; 202 f. Lucian. De sacr.  10 relates that nations honour the gods and make them their citizens (πολίτας). 268 Hdt. 7.189.1. See: W.J.

Polites does not necessarily mean that Dionysos was seen as a co- citizen. Contrary to Auxites, he might be ‘the god of the city’ (= belonging to the city),  just as epithets such as Polias, Polieus, Polissouchos, do not necessarily make Athena  or Zeus a city patron. See on this especially Burkert o.c. (above n. 266) 208.  270 In a rather different sense, citizenship of the gods is a characteristic trait of  Roman religion, according to J. North, Conservatism and Change in Roman Religion,  PBSR 44 (1976) 6 and 11; J.

This  sunteleia is the community of the ones (the gods) who have a common task (telos) as  phylakes of the city, 2) there is a clear—and in my view intended—contrast in v. 253  between politai (the gods) and the fear to become slaves (douleias). </page> <page sequence="75">  many gods: complications of polytheism 97 and men” (τὸν κόσμον . . . συνπολειτευόμενον θεοῖς καὶ ἀνθρώποις).272  This was one of the preferred targets of Epicureans as appears from  Diogenes of Oinoanda, who scorned the Stoics for the assumption that  gods would need a city and human beings as co-citizens.273 In the same  period and region in which Diogenes wrote this (mid 2nd c. AD),  Greek cities would endow gods with city magistracies and make them  eponyms.274 In the form of their images they also frequently headed  processions and official delegations (προπρεσβεύειν).275 With these observations we are confronted with perhaps the most  elementary strategy towards ordering, which we encountered for the  first time in the inscription of Kolophon, “the gods and heroes who  dwell in our city (polis) and land (chora).” It is a strategy that, more- over, is understood and deployed by both locals and outsiders. In Eur.  Phoen. 588 ff. there is a discussion between Eteokles, ready to defend  his city against his brother Polyneikes, who after a year of exile in  Mycene is now at the point of attacking his former home town. When  Polyneikes invokes the gods of Thebes as witnesses and for support,  Eteokles denies him that right: “Invoke the gods at Mykenai, not here”  (Μυκήναις, μὴ ‘νθάδ’ ἀνακάλει θεούς).276 When Polyneikes finally  decides to launch the attack on his native city, he bids farewell to Lord Apollo Aguieus and the palace and the friends of my youth and  the statues of the gods rich in sacrifices (καὶ σɞ Φοῖβ’ ἄναξ Ǹγυιε˃ καὶ  μέλαθρα χαίρετε, ȑλικές θ’ οὑμοὶ θεῶν τε δεξίμηλ’ ἀγάλματα, 631/2).277 272 Philodem.

Despite the predicate I can- not believe that ἀγάλματα is here ‘altars’ as Mastronarde hesitantly considers. Apart  </page> <page sequence="76"> 98 chapter one Later in the same play (1364–1376) Polyneikes indeed invokes the  (Argive) goddess ‘Lady Hera’ arguing: “I am now yours (σὸς γάρ εἰμι),  because I married Adrastos’ daughter and dwell in his land.” Eteokles  invokes Pallas Athena, patroness of Thebes, in her local temple.278 In  Aesch. Sept. 14 Eteokles exhorts his fellow citizens to guard their city  and guard the altars of her local gods (καὶ θεῶν ἐγχωρίων βωμοῖσι).279  Later, at 271 ff., he himself invokes the city-guardian gods of our country, both the ones who control the  fields and those who watch over the market place (ἐγὼ δὲ χώρας τοῖς  πολισσούχοις θεοῖς, πεδιονόμοις τε κἀγορᾶς ἐπισκόποις), and Dirke’s  spring and Ismenos’ stream.280 Aesch. Ag. 88 ff. describes these theoi enchorioi281 as “all the gods that  guide the city, gods on high and gods below the earth, gods of the doors  and of the market-place” (πάντων δὲ θεῶν τῶν ἀστυνόμων, ὑπάτων  χθονίων, τῶν τε θυραίων τῶν τ’ ἀγοραίων), where ἀστυνόμων refers  to the gods οȻς ἡ πόλις νομίζει (as in the charge against Socrates),  θυραίων to gods of the kind of Apollo Aguieus, and ἀγοραίων to the  gods of the public space. The Phoibos Aguieus, invoked by Polyneikes,  is the very same type of ‘personal’ Apollo that is addressed as ‘dearest  from the current meaning of ἀγάλματα the scene derives its tragic flavour from the  presence of the gods in statuesque form, just as Apollo Aguieus is present. However,  particularly in the case of Aguieus the difference between statue and altar is often dif- ficult to draw. Cf. above n. 202. 278 On this scene see: Mikalson 1989, 81. 279 On this scene and the differences between Eteokles’ attitude and that of the  choros of women see: A.L.

E.g. in a treaty between Hierapytna and  Rhodos (I.Cret III iii 3 A pp. 31–36; Bengtson, Staatsverträge 551.3): Ɩῶι ǹλίωι καὶ  τᾶι ˉόδωι καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις θεοῖς πᾶσι καὶ πάσαις καὶ τοῖς ἀρχαγέταις καὶ τοῖς ȑρωσι  ὅσοι ἔχοντι τὰν πόλιν καὶ τὰν χώραν τὰν ˉωδίων (on the old designation archagetas  see: J.H. Kroll, Hesperia Suppl. 20 [1982] 65–76). Cf.

Leoc. 1, “I pray to Athena and the other gods  and heroes established in the city and country . . .” (εȼχομαι γὰρ τʧ Ǹθηνʘ καὶ τοῖς  ἀλλοῖς θεοῖς καὶ τοῖς ȑρωσι κατὰ τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὴν χώραν ἱδρυμένοις) with Parker  1996, 25 f. on its chauvinistic tenor and context and ibid. 147 n. 15 for evidence on  gods ‘of the territory’, ‘city-holding’ ‘before the door’ in Aeschylos.  281 Soph.

Polyneikes, in the passage cited, acts in accordance with inter- communal and inter-statal religious codes. Generals on the point of  decla ring war or launching an attack against an enemy city legitimize  their action and secure the support of the local gods by swearing that  they themselves are not guilty of initiating acts of aggression. In Thuc.  4.87.2, the Spartan general Brasidas threatens the Akanthians, if they  do not take his side: then I shall call upon the gods and heroes of your country (θεοɞς καὶ  ȑρως τοɞς ἐγχωρίους) to witness that I came to help you and could not  make you understand it. I shall lay waste to your land. . . . . Very similar is the situation when the Spartan king Archidamos urges  the Plataeans to come over to the Spartan side. In their reaction (Thuc.  2.71.4), the Plataeans first remind him of earlier oaths of mutual non- aggression (during the Persian war made between all the allies includ- ing Sparta and Plataeae), and they appeal to the gods who witnessed that earlier oath and to the gods of your fathers,  and to the gods of our country (καὶ τοɞς ὑμετέρους πατρˏους καὶ  ἡμετέρους ἐγχωρίους). 282 A.W. Gomme &amp; F.H. Sandbach, Menander. A Commentary (Oxford 1973)  refer to Ar. Vesp. 875 as parallel: Ɋ δέσποτ’ ἄναξ, γεῖτον Ǹγυιε˃ τοὐμο˃ προθύρου  προπύλαιε. Fraenkel Aesch. Agamemnon 1081 quotes von Wilamowitz “the customary  μὰ τὸν Ǹπόλλω τουτονί in Menander,” where note again the deictic notion. These are  some instances out of many in dramatic art where a god, present in the form of his  image, is invoked to heighten the dramatic emotion. Ample evidence in Mastronarde  ad Phoen. 631, who supposes that a statue of Apollo Aguieus is present on the stage.  “The god was the last object of which a wanderer took farewell at his departure, the  first which he greeted on his return,” thus Pritchett 1990, 168, with extensive evidence  on Apollo Aguieus (see above n. 202). On greetings to the local gods, including Agu- ieus, at arrival from abroad: Aesch. Ag. 810: πρῶτον μὲν Ἄργος καὶ θεοɞς ἐγχωρίους  δίκη προσειπεῖν, and 503 ff., where the messenger greets his home-land and the Greek  gods and (519) the palace and the δαίμονες ἀντήλιοι (the eastwards directed divine  statues in front of the entrance of the palace), with Fraenkel ad loc. On the greeting  χαῖρε see below n. 374. </page> <page sequence="78"> 100 chapter one When, subsequently, the Plataeans persist in their allegiance to the  Athenians, the Spartan king calls to witness the gods and heroes of the  land (θεῶν καὶ ἡρώων τῶν ἐγχωρίων 2.74):283 Gods who dwell in (lit: have) the land Plataea and heroes (θεοὶ ὅσοι γῆν  τὴν Ɠλαταιίδα ἔχετε καὶ ȑρωες) bear witness with me that from the  beginning it was in no spirit of aggression, but only because these people  had first broken their engagements with us, that we invaded this land.  (. . . .) Grant us your consent (συγγνώμονες ἔστε) that the punishment  for what has been done wrong may fall on those who were the first to  do evil and that we may be successful in our aim which is a just revenge  (τῆς δὲ τιμωρίας τυγχάνειν). Thus, the gods invoked possess both a universal (functioning as ‘moral  governors of all mankind’) and a local (in their role of defenders of  their own city) aspect.284 In sum, “Your gods may in some sense be  283 They must have been largely the same as the famous series mentioned by Plut.  Arist. 11.3 that we discussed above p. 47. Is the differentiation between Plataean theoi  enchorioi and Spartan theoi patroioi conditioned by the fact that the oath had been  sworn in Plataean territory?  284 The two passages from Thucydides just cited reveal that the expression “who  dwell in our country” is not reserved to heroes, but may just as well apply to gods,  as they no doubt do in other texts adduced above. Obviously heroes are, by their  nature, a privileged category to be endowed with the predicate enchorios (Pausanias  for instance attributes the predicate epichorios to heroes but never to Greek gods:  Pirenne-Delforge 1998, 133 f.; 2008, 244 f. He is also the only author who frequently— though not consistently- uses the word enagizein for the [holocaust] sacrifice for a  certain category of heroes as opposed to thuein for the gods: G. Ekroth, Pausanias and  the Sacrificial Rituals of Greek Hero-cults, in: Hägg 1999, 145–158, Pirenne-Delforge  2008, 185 f. and cf. more generally: K. Stratiki, Le culte des héros grecs chez Pausa- nias [BAGB 2002], 70–93). After all, they are—at least in principle—typically bound  to their local place, whether grave or heroon, generally marked by an enclosure. They  often have only one sanctuary and are confined to one city. They also more typically  serve as focuses of identity and defenders of groups and cities. See: Kearns 1989 Ch.  III (city), and Chs. IV and IV (smaller groups); eadem, Between Gods and Man: Sta- tus and Function of Heroes and their Sanctuaries, in: Schachter 1992, 65–107, espec.  73–77; U. Kron, Patriotic Heroes, in: Hägg 1999, 61–83, who discusses two types of  saving heroes. Of course heroes may migrate to other cities as well: J.W. Hall, Beyond  the “polis”: the Multilocality of Heroes, in: Hägg 1999, 123–143; A. Blomart, Transfer- ring the Cults of Heroes in Ancient Greece, in: Aiken &amp; Maclean 2004. But see the  critical approach of D. Boehringer, Heroenkulte in Griechenland von der geometrischen  bis zur klassischen Zeit. Attika, Argolis, Messenien (Berlin 2001) espec. 13–159. Their  proximity is essential (Kearns ibid. 83), entailing characterisations such as ἐπιχώριος  δαίμων (Paus. 6.20.2 for Sosipolis at Elis), or ȑρως γείτων (below p. 136). Cf. Rus- ten 1983, 288–297. Despite all this, it is remarkable that the testimonia just cited, as  well as many others mentioned earlier, show that heroes have to share their predicate  enchorios with the gods, who, by possessing a sanctuary in land or city are likewise  regarded as ‘endemic’, i.e. ‘established in our country or city’, as for instance in the  expression ἡμετέρα θεός for Athena (Ar. Nub. 601, and more in Parker 2005, 396,  </page> <page sequence="79">  many gods: complications of polytheism 101 the same as mine; they may even have the same name as mine; but  they are still local (ἐγχώριος) to your city.”285 Corollary to this is that,  as Aesch. Sept. 218 voices a common notion, “the gods depart when  a city is taken” (θεοɞς τοɞς τῆς DZλούσης πόλεος ἐκλείπειν λόγος), a  recurrent expression286 that represents a deep-rooted popular convic- tion, perhaps most impressively worded in the famous line of Virgil  Aen. 2.351: excessere omnes, adytis arisque relictis, di quibus imperium  hoc steterat.287 As so often, it is satirists who precisely put their finger on the spot  by playing with this remarkable ambiguity between pan-Hellenic and  local facets of homonymous gods. When, in the comedy named after  her, Lysistrata addresses Spartans and Athenians as Greeks, she appeals  to their common cults of pan-Hellenic gods in Olympia, Thermopylai,  Delphi, at the time that the allied Greeks resisted the Persian attack  (1129–1134).288 However, when later in the same play Athenians and  Spartans finally make a treaty and call the gods as witnesses to their  oaths, each of the parties, besides using their own dialects,289 invoke  their own gods. These gods, even when they bear the same names, are  n. 35) and, much later, ἐπιχώριος θεός for the divinised Antinoos in an inscription  from Mantineia (IG V.2, 281). 285 Rowe 1976, 43, in one of the most thoughtful—though largely ignored—studies  on the implications and the problems of polytheism.  286 Cf. the commentary of Groeneboom ad loc.; Hdt 8.41; Soph. Fr. 452; Eur. Tro.  26 f.; Chr. Pelling, Plutarch: Life of Antony (Cambridge 1988) on Plut. Ant. 75.4;  R. Parker, Gods Cruel and Kind, in: Pelling 1997, 154; Scheer 2000, 219–222; West  1997, 487: “This desertion of a city by a god is an absolutely commonplace motif  in Sumerian and Akkadian literature.” In his prayer in Aesch. Sept. 76 f. Eteokles  reminds the gods that it is also in their interest to protect the city against the enemy  with the expression “Methinks it is our common cause I urge” (ξυνὰ δ’ ἐλπίζω λέγειν).  Conversely, Greeks could justify the plundering of an alien sanctuary by interpreting  it as a sign that a community had been abandoned by the gods. See: Chaniotis 2005,  157 with the evidence. Chr. Habicht, Versaümter Götterdienst, Historia 55 (2006)  153–166, has collected testimonies concerning the interruption of cult and festivals  due to precarious circumstances of war or lack of finances, as well as the fear of the  population’s fear of the (divine) consequences.  287 There are more Roman testimonies (see Pelling l.c. preceding note), where a  connection with the typically Roman ritual of the evocatio cannot be excluded.  288 J.

The Spartans in turn invoke only and purely Spartan  deities.292 First they invite the Lakonian Musa to lead the hymns to  the god of Amyklai (Apollo), Athena of the Brazen House, the val- iant Tyndarides, while the choroi are directed by the daughter of Leda  (Helena).293 Sameness and difference, self and other. What emerges is a picture  of overlapping and sometimes clashing systems of organisation. The  local pantheon of each single polis is a model of a small divine kosmos.  However, it appears to be flanked on two sides by two extreme alterna- tives. On the one hand there is the all-embracing national pantheon  defined by a common Hellenic heritage, providing ample opportunity  for conflict between local and national. On the other hand there are  various types of personal religiosity. Let us first have a quick glance at  the former one. 2. Beyond the polis border (and back) “The gods of the Greeks” All nations have their own religious cultures, as Hdt. 8.144. was the  first to state in a celebrated passage where the Athenians give their  reasons for never even considering defection from the common Greek  cause. Here they mention the four central characteristics constituting  to Hellenikon: 290 Furley &amp; Bremer 2001, I, 346–349; II, 336–340. 291 Cf. below p. 118 on this type of oath-gods. 292 How very Spartan (including joking allusions) is well demonstrated by C.A.  Anderson, Athena’s Epithets. Their Structural Significance in Plays of Aristophanes  (Stuttgart-Leipzig 1995), 52 f. 293 The differentiation is not restricted to comedy. Paus. 4.27.6. on the new foun- dation of Messene after the battle of Leuctra, relates that the Thebans sacrificed to  Dionysos and Apollo Ismenios, the Argeans to Hera of Argos and Zeus of Nemea, the  Messenians to Zeus of Ithome and the Dioskouroi. See: Detienne &amp; Sissa 1989, 203 f.  I am less sure whether at Paus. 4.27.5 Epaminondas’ instruction to the manteis to  inquire εἰ βουλήσεται ταύτʤ καὶ τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἐπιχωρῆσαι means “si les dieux veulent  habiter là” (however much it would suit my argument).  </page> <page sequence="81">  many gods: complications of polytheism 103 the common blood (descent), the common language, the temples and  religious rituals, and the whole way of life we understand and share  together (τὸ Ἑλληνικόν, ἐὸν ὅμαιμόν τε καὶ ὁμόγλωσσον, καὶ θεῶν  ἱδρύματά τε κοινὰ καὶ θυσίαι Ȑθεά τε ὁμότροπα). These happen to be exactly the four great characteristics that, as our  anthropological textbooks teach us, are still regarded as the basic  materials of a culture’s identity. This definition of to hellenikon stands  alone among our ancient sources, and hence suggests a personal view  of Herodotus himself, rather than an opinion of an average Greek.294  His special focus on the religious element in the shared elements of  Greekness is also manifest in his emphasis on the Athenians’ “first and  most weighty” reasons for not defecting, namely “the images and habi- tations of the gods (πρῶτα μὲν καὶ μέγιστα τῶν θεῶν τὰ ἀγάλματα καὶ  τὰ οἰκήματα), that have been burnt down and which we are obliged  to avenge.”295 Greekness is inter alia and not in the last place deter- mined by sharing gods and cults.296 However, as Irene Polinskaya in an  important paper convincingly argues,297 we should beware of equating  the Greek terms homoios and koinos in the passage cited.298 Accord- ingly, she demonstrates that “having common shrines and sacrifices”  here (like elsewhere) does not refer to typological similarity between  294 As argued by J. Hall, Hellenicity. Between Ethnicity and Culture ( Chicago –  London  2002), 190 f. On this celebrated Herodotean passage see especially: K. Zacharia, Hero- dotus’ Four Markers of Greek Identity, in, eadem (ed.), Hellenism. Culture, Identity,  and Ethnicity from Antiquity to Modernity (Cornwall 2008) 21–36.  295 On the Persian violations of temples and images see: Scheer 2000, 201–229;  P. Funke, o.c. (below n. 323). 296 Besides Hdt. 8. 144 see: Xen. Hell. 2.4.20; Isokr. 4.43–6. Cf. Henderson l.c. above  n. 288. Gods and cult are the minimum definitions of the polis according to Plut. Mor.  1125E: “Travellers may find cities which have no walls, no kings, no houses of stone,  no writing, no coined money, no theatre or gymnasium, but a city without cult places  and gods (ἀνιέρου δὲ πόλεως καὶ ἀθέου) no traveller has ever seen.” 297 Polinskaya 2010. 298 “There is, however, a conceptual and in fact a mathematical difference between  things that are ‘same’ and things that are ‘common.’ ‘Same’ implies an equation  between the elements of comparison, while ‘common’ connotes an intersection, an  overlap.” She here follows a few predecessors with the same vision: A. Schachter,  Greek Deities: Local and Pan-hellenic Identities, in: P. Flensted-Jensen (ed.), Further  Greek Studies in the Ancient Greek Polis (Stuttgart 2000), 9–17, espec. 10: “The fact  that we are Hellenes, that is, we have the same blood and the same language, we share  sanctuaries and festivals of gods, we have the same way of looking at life.” Sourvinou- Inwood, 2000a, 300: “The Greeks saw themselves as part of one religious group; the  fact that they had common sanctuaries and sacrifices—as well as the same language  and the same blood, a perceived common ancestry, and the same way of life—was one  of the defining characteristics of Greekness.”  </page> <page sequence="82"> 104 chapter one Greek religious practices, as in “we, Greeks, have sanctuaries for the  gods and conduct sacrifices.” Rather it indicates a concrete, exclusive  usage, limited to a specific group involved in sharing and to specific  conditions under which this sharing is possible. More precisely, the  shared sanctuaries and festivals that Herodotus had in mind were  probably specific places and events, as for instance the great panhel- lenic sanctuaries and the festivals celebrated there.”299 As early as the fifth century BC we find several dedications from  Naukratis “to the gods of the Greeks” (τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν Ἑλληνῶν), writ- ten on the wall of a building that according to the editor must have  been “devoted to the worship of several individual gods and the ‘gods  of the Greeks’ as a whole.”300 This building must have been the Hel- lenion which Hdt. 2.178 describes as the central temple of Naukratis  constructed by the concerted action of a large number of Greek cities.  It obviously served as an icon of Greek cohabitation and as an ethnic  tool for anchoring their common self-identity safely in the sand of the  Egyptian environment. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that things are too  complicated to warrant such a global qualification without further  discussion. Polinskaya 2010 summarizes the problems. First, only in  two of the 27 graffiti taken as referring to the “gods of the Greeks,”  are the words for gods and Hellenes possibly coupled together, and  in two more cases, the coupling might be suggested by the preserved  article tois coupled with the beginning of the word Hellenes. Each of  these four graffiti individually could be restored differently than “the  gods of the Greeks.” Secondly, the Hellenion was shared by nine Greek  communities, listed by Herodotus 2.178, but not by all the Greeks in  299 As suggested by Henderson o.c. (above n. 288) and A. Schachter o.c. (above  n. 298), 2. See also: P. Funke, Herodotus and the Major Sanctuaries of the Greek  World, in: V. Karageorghis &amp; I.

There were a number of separate Greek sanctuaries founded  by other Greek communities, including those of Aegina, Samos, and  Milete, as Herodotus tells us, which have indeed been recovered. So,  if the Hellenion was the temenos of “the gods of the Greeks,” these  gods were not the gods of all the Greeks, but only of those who did  not boast an individual temenos of themselves. More generally it appears that the expression “Gods of the Greeks”  never enjoyed great popularity in Greece itself. If Greeks refer to the  totality of their own gods, they rather use the expression πάντες θεοί,  to which we shall return in Appendix I of this book. In epigraphical  texts expressions such as “Gods of the Greeks” are extremely rare: in  literature they occur practically without exception in (mostly rhetori- cal) contrastive or patriotic contexts. Whenever the expression θεοὶ  (οἱ) Ἑλλήνιοι vel sim. occurs in Herodotus, this is always in explicit  opposition to foreign, especially hostile, cultures, and/or with a focus  on the unity of Hellenic culture.301 Moreover, if Greeks wish to empha- size their common identity in terms of religion they seem to prefer  references to common cults, festivals or sacred places, as in Hdt. 8.144  just quoted. “(Inter)national religion” in the sense of common Greek  religion, especially when used as an argument, is cultic rather than  theological.302 Divine globalisation: an excursion abroad Contrarily, references to gods (and cults and rituals) of other national- ities abound and their numbers kept pace with the expansion  of—and  301 In the words of How and Wells ad Hdt. 2.178: “in impassionate appeals to Greek  sentiment.” Cf. Hdt. 5.92.ηŸ 5.49.3; also 8.144 (5.99.7 β: Zeus Hellenios, and 4.108 are  not about the Greek gods, but about Greek gods). Moreover, all these expressions  occur only in speeches, “dies heisst in der naiven Perspektive des jeweiligen Akteurs”  (Burkert 1990, 24 f.). Cf. Harrison 2000, 215, and J. Henderson’s remark above n. 288.  For this reason, pace Sourvinou-Inwood, Hdt. 5.92.η, (where two opposing parties  each invoke the same gods of the Greeks) cannot serve as a testimony “that the gods  who were worshipped in the different poleis were, of course, perceived to be the same  gods” (see above n. 145 and Appendix II). Not only for its high grade of rhetoric, but,  more importantly, because it is the common Greek gods who are invoked here and  not “the gods of the different Greek poleis.” Note that the secular notion of “panhelle- nism”, too, developed under the influence of contacts (and conflicts) with foreign cul- tures, especially Persia. See: L.G. Mitchell, Panhellenism and the Barbarian in Archaic  and Classical Greece (Swansea 2007) Ch. III. 302 As is clear from Parker 2005, 79–88, whose relevant chapter with the title ‘Inter- national Religion’, deals with theoriai, groups visiting sanctuaries of other cities, mem- bership of Amphictyonies, and Pan-hellenic festivals.  </page> <page sequence="84"> 106 chapter one the intensification of contacts with—rising empires, first of all the  Persian. Xen. Inst. Cyr. 3.3.21 f. makes Cyrus sacrifice “first to Zeus  Basileus, next also to the other gods (τοῖς ἄλλοις θεοῖς) . . . And together  he also called in the heroes who inhabit the land of the Medes (ȑρωας  γῆς Μηδίας οἰκήτορας).”303 As a result of political and cultural globali- sation, inscriptions—especially curse texts—from Asia Minor, already  in the classical, but increasingly in the Hellenistic and Roman periods,  display references to “the gods of the Greeks and the Persians;”304 “the  gods of the Pisidians”305 and “the gods of the Romans.”306 While here  the “gods of the Greeks” are no doubt equivalent to what the Greeks  themselves used to refer to as their πάντες θεοί,307 the gods of the Per- sians and Pisidians sometimes evidently refer to pairs or groups of  local gods. Already in the late classical and early Hellenistic periods  we have side by side with the Lydian Mother and the Lydian Zeus,  whom we already met, also dedications to ‘Artemis the Persian’308 and  ‘Artemis the Ephesian’. A fourth/third c. BC inscription from Asia  Minor has “Artemis the Medan and the Ephesian and all the gods”  (ἡ Ἄρτεμις ἡ Μήδεια καὶ ἡ Ȇφεσία καὶ οἱ θεοὶ ǵπαντες).309 303 Clearly, the expression is viewed through a Greek looking glass, but therefore  even better illustrates the Greek notion that all cultures have their own national  gods.  304 Once, as θυοὶ (= θεοὶ) Ἑλλήνων καὶ Ɠερσῶν, “une grande nouvauté:” L.

The cult of Ἄρτεμις Ɠερσική does not imply a Hel- lenization of Anahita but rather a Persianization of the cult of Artemis.  309 Of course S.M. Sherwin-White, ZPE 49 (1982) 30, is right in rejecting the inter- pretation that this is Artemis qualified with the personal name of the famous sorceress  Medeia, as proposed by A.N. Oikonomides, ZPE 45 (1982) 116, but hardly in her own  suggestion that we have here one goddess with two different epithets: “The goddess  </page> <page sequence="85">  many gods: complications of polytheism 107 An interesting text may refer to the same two Artemides as the ones  here mentioned. It also provides a unique testimony of what may have  been a clash between their respective worshippers. It is an inscrip- tion from Ephesos (ca. 340–320 BC) which proclaims the death sen- tence on people from Sardes who had committed a sacrilege against  Artemis Ephesia. When the Ephesians sent a theoria to Sardis to bring  the sacred clothes to the local Artemision founded by the Ephesians,  the condemned persons had assaulted the theoroi and violated the  hiera.310 Most specialists argue that these Sardians were followers of  their own local Artemis—be it the originally Greek Artemis of Sardes  or the Persian Anahita = Artemis Anaeitis—and defended her own  goddess against Ephesian311 oppressive competition. It is in the Hellenistic period that Greek cities, especially those  in Asia Minor, hand in hand with the decrease of their autonomy,  who is invoked is Persian and Ephesian Artemis.” Cf. S.E.

AD, the Ephesian goddess was declared in a public document to be, in direct  comparison with the other Olympians, “forever the greatest among all the gods” (SEG  43.756). H. Koester (ed.), Ephesos.

And their competitiveness was analogous.312 The inscriptions that we  just discussed as well as a few that we saw earlier belong to the earliest  testimonies of this new ideology, which proliferated over the centuries  and reached its acme in the Roman period. It is also in the period  of Roman imperialistic expansion that the religious horizon expands.  The treaty of Hannibal and Philippos of 216 BC313 provides an early  illustration. The oath is inter alia sworn by all the gods that inhabit/possess Carthage and all the gods that inhabit/ possess Macedonia and the rest of Greece (ἐναντίον πάντων θεῶν ὅσοι  κατέχουσι ƍαρχεδόνα, ἐναντίον πάντων θεῶν ὅσοι Μακεδονίαν καὶ τὴν  ἄλλην Ἑλλάδα κατέχουσι). Globalisation of the Mediterranean world fostered migration of  Greek (and other) gods, sometimes with curiously confusing effects.  An inscription from Thera in Karia (Asia Minor) has a dedication to  “Asklepios, the one who is at Epidauros” (Ǹντίμαχος Ǹσκληπιˑ τˑ ἐν  Ȇπιδαύρˎ εὐχήν),314 who is apparently another god than for instance  the famous Asklepios at Pergamon. A much later Latin inscription  from Carthage, however, reads “to the Aesculapius from Epidauros”  (Aesculapio ab Epidauro, AE 1968 no. 553). The first presumably was  dedicated by a pilgrim who was cured by the god in his Epidaurian  sanctuary, the other in a local Carthaginean sanctuary of the Epidau- rian god, as there were many such satellite sanctuaries.315 Are they the  same gods: one remaining at Epidauros to whom you must go in per- son in order to communicate with him and pray for recovery, the other  having migrated to your own town and hence easier to approach? The  Epidaurian cult centre is notorious for its expansion through founda- tions of annexes elsewhere by means of the transfer of a symbol of his  312 I have analysed the paradox of freedom in subjection of the Hellenistic cities in  Versnel 1990 Ch.

More complicated are dedications, found at the Esquiline at Rome, to  Asclepius Zimidrenus (or: Sindrinus) by citizens of the Thracian city of Philippopolis  in Thrace who formed part of the praetorian cohorts.

Less obviously so in the  case of the many Epidaurian Asklepioi. And what about another very  self-replicating deity in North Africa known as inter alia: Ceres Maru- sia (I.L.Alg.

First the goddess  in her old temple is asked ‘to divide’ her divinity; next, in her new temple, she is  invoked to come from a huge number of lands and places (“so umfassend aufgelistet,  daß dabei geradezu eine Geographie herauskommt”) where she is supposed to sojourn  every now and then.

He adduces a unique passage from a text  known as ‘the Expansion (or Adlocation) of the goddess of the night’: “Honoured  deity! Preserve your being, but divide your divinity! Come to that new temple, too, and  take yourself the honoured place! And when you make your way, then take yourself  only that place.” From the italicized passages he deduces that the deity was conceived  of as “a single entity, a distinct personality, which, however, could divide herself into  two parts that would each retain the qualities of the original singularity” (67).

Or  would the (some, many) ancient believers rather react as the nun in  a monastery of miracle-working Haghia Eirene (Irini) that I visited,  who, on learning that I also hoped to visit another monastery of the  same Saint, riposted: “No need to go there: our Irini is better.” I am  not sure whether in the eyes of the locals the Ceres Africana was better  than the Ceres Graeca to the same degree as the Artemis of Ephesos  in the view of the Ephesian citizens was better than the Persian one,  but at any rate she was “our goddess.” Ancient Greeks might react  in different ways, any Greek might react differently according to his  momentary context. The present section has taught us that the religious culture of the  Greek people is marked by a multitude of horizons. A local one, a  national one and an international one. After our quick excursion into  the world outside Greece we return to the first two divine worlds,  being the ones that dominated the archaic, classical and partly also the  Hellenistic periods. Greeks, as Greeks, speak the same language and  worship the same gods, as Athenians and Spartans they speak different  (Greek) languages and have different gods, even when addressed with  the same (Greek) names. What happens when the two worlds meet? When local meets national/regional/local The following example beautifully illustrates what can happen when  two levels of discourse come to clash. Earlier we came across the ques- tion asked to establish Athenian citizenship: “Where is your Apollo  Patroos and your Zeus Herkeios?” The two gods are the symbols of  one’s place of belonging. In Pl. Euthd. 302b, Dionysodoros from Chios  asks: “Tell me Socrates do you have a Zeus Patroos?” (ἔστιν σοι Ɖεɞς  Ɠατρˑος)? When Socrates has to confess that he cannot boast such  319 See: G.

Then Socrates explains that,  like all other Athenians, he does have his own cults both oikeia (house  cults) and patroa (ancestral cults), but that a Zeus with the eponymic  epithet Patroos is alien to Ionians, including Athenians.321 “We have an  Apollo Patroos. In Athens Zeus is not called patroos but herkeios and  phratrios, just as [we have an] Athena phratria.” Finally, the conclu- sion of his opponent: “So you do have gods such as Apollo, and Zeus  and Athena?” is confirmed by Socrates. I could not imagine a better example of playing322 with gods who  reveal their exclusive and culturally determined identities through spe- cific epithets, yet in the end are summarily acknowledged as the great  Olympians. At the same time it is an outstanding example of the con- fusion and the ambiguities that may surface when equality and differ- ence, self and other, are selected as a subject of discussion and hence  consciously confronted by the Greeks themselves. These ambiguities  between local, regional and national religions persistently interfere  in an alarming alternation, also in cultic practice. Due to common  Greekness Greeks as a rule shun destroying or robbing sanctuaries of  other poleis even if they are in war. Xen. Hell. 3.2.22, reports that at  Olympia there was an oracular shrine of Zeus, where “an ancient and  established principle obtained that Greeks should not consult the ora- cle with regard to a war waged against Greeks.” In Thuc. 4.97.2–3, the  Boeotians explicitly appealed to a pan-Hellenic norm (νόμιμα) when  they accused the Athenians of violating a temple.323 On the other hand,  321 That this is not entirely true (RE XVIII 9 [1949] 2259 ff; Van Leeuwen ad Ar.  Nub. 1468 f.), perhaps as a corollary of Apollo’s overwhelming position as Patroos in  Athens, is neither relevant for the passage nor for our issue. See on Apollo Patroos  above n. 236. On this passage of Plato and its implications for the meaning of Apollo  Patroos and Zeus Herkeios see: Brulé 2005a. 322 Epithets are ‘good to play with’: C.A. Anderson, o.c. above n. 292. The word  ‘play’ is even more appropriate when one is aware of the polysemantic nature or the  term patroos (Parker 2005, 22 f.).  323 On this passage see: W.K. Pritchett, The Greek State at War V (Berkeley 1991)  162; S. Hornblower, A Commentary on Thucydides II (Oxford 1996) 309 f. See also:  F. Walbank ad Polyb 4.62 and 5.11. The violation of sanctuaries is often worded in terms  of οὐ μόνον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς πολεμεῖν (Polyb. 4.62.3; 32.15.13; Isoc.  Paneg. 156).

Although resident gods are  expected to defend their city against human invaders, outside the  domain of literary texts it will be hard to find the idea of a god believed  to have defended his/her own Greek city against the (patron) god(s) of  another Greek city.325 Such a conception is typical of epic, most obvi- ously of the Homeric scenes of divine battles. And it may occur in  satirical genres. Babrios 15 (= 50 Halm) does play with the idea: im 5. und 4. Jahrhundert vor Chr. (Stuttgart 2005) 143–165. The material on ‘general  Hellenic laws’ has been collected by P. Ducrey, Le traitement des prisonniers de guerre  dans la Grèce antique des origines à la conquête romaine (Paris 1999) 289–295. J. de  Romilly, La loi dans la pensé grècque (Paris 1971) 40–45, shows that most references  to ‘Hellenic law’ actually are appeals to general moral principles which distinguish  Greeks from barbarians. Cf. J. Wilkins, Euripides: Heraclidae (Oxford 1991) on vv.  963 ff. and 1010 ff. It was these νόμιμα that enabled Herodotus to introduce  vindictive  hierosylia as the major incentive of the Persian aggression, as argued by P. Funke, Die  Perser und die griechischen Heiligtümer in der Perserkriegszeit, in: B. Bleckmann  (ed.), Herodot und die Epoche der Perserkriege (Köln etc. 2007) 21–34. 324 Cf. the well-known stories about Kleomenes’ unsuccessful attempts to enter the  Athenian Akropolis (Hdt. 5.72.3) and to bring a sacrifice at the altar of the Heraion at  Argos (Hdt. 6. 81–82). On the first see: R.C.T. Parker, Cleomenes on the Acropolis: An  Inaugural Lecture Delivered before the University of Oxford on 12 May 1997 (Oxford  1998). The wording of this ban spoken by the priestess of Athena οὐ γὰρ θεμιτὸν  ∆ωριε˃σι παριέναι ἐντα˃θα, resembles that of an (enigmatic) ‘lex sacra’ from Paros  (LSCG no. 110, 5th c. BC) ƙσένοι ∆οριῆι ωὐ θέμις. . . . . Cf. NGSL pp. 18–21. The fact  that this type of prohibitions needed to be made explicit in leges sacrae implies that  it is not a hard and fast rule.

Occasionally we get the information that a xenos could take part in cult  only with the help of a citizen, normally the proxenos of his city, who acted as an  intermediary. See: M.-F.

Butz, Prohibitory Inscriptions,  xenoi, and the Influence of the Early Greek Polis, in: Hägg 1995, 75–95, provides an  extensive discussion of the only four extant inscriptions concerning prohibition of  foreigners (including the one just quoted) and of the case of Kleomenes.

Cole, Gunaiki ou Themis: Gender Differences in the Greek  Leges Sacrae, Helios 19 (1992) 104–122.  325 This is quite a different thing than the often expressed conviction or hope that  the justness of one’s case makes ‘the gods’ into one’s partisans. On this general use of  ‘the gods’ and its implications see: Chs. II and III. Different, too, are attempts to win  the gods of an enemy city over for your own (just) case.

The advocate of  Theseus, a clever speaker, wins the discussion, and the other exclaims:  “Enough. You won. May therefore Theseus be angry at my people and  Herakles at the Athenians.” We also find it in Eur. Heracl. 347–352, where Iolaos boasts that his  party (Athens) has better divine allies (συμμάχους) than the Argeans,  for “they have Hera as sovereign, but we have Athena and it is our luck  that we have better gods” (θεῶν ἀμεινόνων τυχεῖν). However, such  human boasts (or hopes) to have the better god as compared to the  one of the enemy are exceptional. For that matter, in the two examples  quoted, they are disqualified by their immediate contexts. One famous  instance of one god being invoked to protect his/her city against the  power of (an)other god(s) is of a different nature: Solon 4.1–4 (W.): Our city shall never fall by the doom of Zeus nor by the contriving of  the blessed gods. Pallas Athena, great of heart, our overseer (episkopos),  born of the thunder-father, holds up her hands to guard us. This is a peculiar case, for two reasons: the particular nature of the  notion Zeus326 and the particularly close relationship between the god  Zeus and his daughter Athena.327 Generally, however, the ‘divine law’  326 Zeus is often just another word for the arbitrary and impartial force that allots  good and bad luck (see Chs. II and III). This explains why he himself in the archaic  period is hardly ever a city-god (above n. 266). Brackertz 1976, 93 f., argues that Zeus  is a god “von dem man sich kaum ein persönliches Eingreifen für eine bestimmte  Stadt vorstellen konnte,” since it was the ideal “einen persönlichen Schutzpatron zu  haben.” 327 As so often, also here the borderline between religious belief and poetical meta- phor is hard to draw. Parker 1996, 69, accords it the prize of “expressing for the first  time in our records (though scarcely in history) a fundamental tenet of civic piety  at Athens.” Cf. Parker 1997, 150 f., on Athena as protectress of Athens and other  protective ‘city holding’ gods. Garland 1992, 29: “The poem intimates that Athena  exercised her guardianship over Athens (. . .) by intercession with her father, in much  the same way as the Blessed Virgin Mary intercedes with the Son.” He also refers to  Hdt. 7.141.3–4, the oracle of Delphi against the Athenians at the invasion by Xerxes:  “Pallas Athena cannot propitiate Olympian Zeus, even though she prays with many  utterances and profound wisdom.” On these texts, and adding Aristophanes’ pun on  Solon’s image (Equ. 1168 ff.) see: C.J. Herington, Athena in Athenian Literature and  Cult, in: C. Hooker (ed.), Parthenos and Parthenon (G&amp;R suppl. 10, 1963) 61–73. On  the special type of relationship of Athena with her father Zeus: J. Neils, Athena, Alter  Ego of Zeus, in: Deacy &amp; Villing 2001, 219–32, espec. 222, discussing the present text  and a drinking song in which Athena and her father together defend the city (Ath.  15. 694c; Page, PMG nos. 884 ff.): “It is precisely this pairing that guarantees the well- being and prosperity of Athens.” </page> <page sequence="92"> 114 chapter one expressed by Artemis in Eur. Hipp. 1329 f. seems to prevail: “The gods  are bound by this law (νόμος): nobody will obstruct another’s plan, but  we keep aloof.”328 Two domains of ‘ours’, one sometimes embracing, at other times  excluding the other. One national pantheon, many regional and many  more local pantheons. And lots of questions. For instance, and most  pressing though generally disregarded, the question of identity that we  discussed. It appears that Greek gods suffer from multiperspectiveness.  Simultaneously functioning in different spheres of belonging they (or  many of them) participate both in the pan-hellenic Olympian divine  family on the mythical Mount Olympos and in various local—and  locally widely divergent—pantheons. The relationship between these  different horizons may be of the nature of inclusion, or of comple- mentarity or of contest.329 ‘Commuting’ from one domain to the other,  as for instance from national myth to local cult, entails dissolution of  former contexts and relations, and sometimes radical adaptations to  new identities. The bewildering result is that we are confronted with a  Zeus Heraios—‘Zeus belonging to Hera’—mentioned in an inscription  from Mytilene,330 while from other places we know a Zeus Aphrodisios  (Paros)331 and a Zeus Damatrios (Rhodos).332 That one god is allotted a  place in the temple of another as a companion—a parhedros—is com- mon practice, but a Zeus of Hera, of Demeter, of Aphrodite is a dif- 328 Mind, though, that this law seems to have been invented for the occasion. Bar- rett ad loc. is unable to give parallels. Donald Mastronarde, however, refers me to what  he wrote in: Blackwell Companion to Greek Tragedy, “Gods”, note 1: “While this claim  is conditioned by the needs of the plot, it should not be dismissed as a one-time ad hoc  feature. Compare Hera’s awaiting the moment when she can act against Heracles (Eur.  Heracles 828–32; note too Zeus’ inaction when Hera does act) and Athena’s explana- tion of why she had not helped Odysseus return earlier (Homer, Odyssey 13.341–3).” 329 Thus B. Gladigow in GGA 235 (1983) 6. 330 A.J. Heisserer &amp; R. Hodot, The Mytilenean Decree of Concord, ZPE 63 (1986)  109–128, espec. 112 unconvincingly suggest “an allusion to the majesty of Zeus as the  Master of Olympus.” Another Zeus Heraios in Athens: IG I2 840.21 = I3 234. 21. Cf.  LSCG no. 1 p. 2. “Il s’ agit probablement d’un culte pratiqué dans les sanctuaires de  ces divinités.” Cf. Schwabl, RE Suppl. XV, 1068, who connects it with Hieros Gamos  ritual. On the specific nature of Hera of Samos see: Ph. Brize, Offrandes de l’époque  géométrique et archaïque à l’Héraion de Samos, in: de La Genière 1997, 123–140.

The city of Argos finds its identity “in der  umfassenden Lokalgöttin Hera, nicht der Gattin des Zeus.”335 333 A curious analogon can be found in a Christian oracle question (PSI XVII  Congr. 21 = M. Manfredi, Trenta testi greci da papiri letterari e documentari [Firenze  1983]) 70: ὁ θ(εὸς) τῆ[ς θ]εοδόκος Μαρία (read: θεοτόκου Μαρίας) δίδοι . . . “May the  god of Maria, mother of god, give . . .” For parallels see commentary a.l. Again differ- ent are the two or three twined divine names that are characteristic of Italic religion  of the type (Latin) Lua Saturni, Ianus Quirini, (Umbr.) Tursa Serfia Serfer Martier.  The construction and meaning of the different parts have never been fully explained:  K.

As appears from  this bibliography it was a hot topic in the first half of the 20th century but has practi- cally disappeared from current scholarly discussion. How untransparent the matter is  may be apparent from Kerényi’s interpretation of the Umbrian divine combination  quoted above: “O ‘schreckende Gottheit’ in der Lage, in der du dich im Wirkungskreis  des ‘Unterweltgöttes’ offenbarst, jenes Gottes in der Lage, in der er in der Sphäre des  ‘Kriegsgottes’ sich zeigt.” Moreover, U. Scholz, Studien zum altitalischen und altrö- mischen Marskult und Marsmythos (Heidelberg 1970) 63, n. 44, was right when he  wrote: “Die Frage nach dem Wesen des Polytheismus überhaupt blieb dabei leider  unbeachtet.” But see now: J. Scheid, Hierarchy and Structure in Roman Polytheism:  Roman Methods of Conceiving Action, in: C. Ando (ed.), Roman Religion (Edinburgh  2003) 164–189.  334 One can also compare Athena Areia, on which see below nn. 340 f. 335 Auffarth 1994b, 25.

All this despite the fact that Hera at Argos, too, was asso- ciated with marriage and the nuptial bed: A. Kauffmann-Samaras, Le lit dans l’Héraion  d’Argos, Ktema 15 (1990) 185–194. More generally J.D. Baumbach, The Significance  of Votive Offerings in Selected Hera Sanctuaries in the Peloponnese, Ionia and Western  Greece (Oxford 2004), has managed to delienate different specific functions of each  Hera, even though in all six sanctuaries offerings also disclose a universal association  of Hera with agriculture and vegetation. </page> <page sequence="94"> 116 chapter one Back to the polis If then polytheism is a multidimensional network of cults and reli- gions, ever varying according to context, place and individual interest,  what can we say about the question from which we took our departure,  namely that of order versus chaos? Is the local pantheon of a  village or  city an orderly composition? Not in the sense of a structuralist kosmos  as it may be sought (and sometimes found) in a panhellenic mythical  pantheon. But perhaps it still satisfies in its own particular way the  definition given by Sourvinou-Inwood 1990 = 2000a, 19: Greek religion is, above all, a way of articulating the world, of structur- ing chaos and making it intelligible; it is a model articulating a cos- mic order guaranteed by a divine order which also (in complex ways)  grounds human order, perceived to be incarnated above all in the prop- erly ordered and pious polis, and providing certain rules and prescrip- tions of behaviour, especially towards the divine through cult. The gods who are enchorioi to a city or village together constitute  another pantheon, that is another kosmos—a mikrokosmos if you  wish—, complying with a different law of organization. This kosmos  is not construed as a grammar of symbolic meanings, as proposed by  Vernant for the panhellenic divine world. The local kosmos is com- posed in accordance with principles of sacred place and sacred time.  Local gods are right here in their sacred topography, and they are right  now, as registered in the familiar chronological order of the local fes- tive calendars. Their order is that of a map drawn to delineate a coher- ent landscape with centres of divine power to resort to and divine  residents to appeal to, havens to anchor one’s identity. And, in this  way—perhaps only in this way—they together form a (locally) coher- ent universe. Two examples provide a wonderful illustration of this. Arist. AP 42.3 tells us that in Athens, as the initial part of their rite  de passage towards adulthood and citizenship, the epheboi were led  on a long circuit of the sanctuaries of the city (πρῶτον μὲν τὰ ἱερὰ  περιῆλθον). “The purpose of this tour of the temples was presum- ably to instil in the ephebi a sense of devotion to the cults of Athens,”  writes Rhodes ad loc. No doubt, but at the same time the tour served  to ritualize their inclusion into the city as a sacred universe.336 Citi- 336 On the ephebic rituals, especially in view of their training as fighters, see Chani- otis 2005, 44–56. An interesting insight into the possible political aspects of such rituals  is offered by an inscription of 122 BC (IG II2 1006, ll. 65–71) describing an excursion  </page> <page sequence="95">  many gods: complications of polytheism 117 zenship inter alia meant κοινονία τῶν ἱερῶν just as, contrarily, exclu- sion from the ἱερά was the signal par excellence of atimia.337 It has  been surmised that the epheboi during their tour brought sacrifices  at every altar connected with these temples,338 which would well tally  with the extended programs of festivals and ritual obligations in which  they participated during the period of their initiation. We find them  spelled out in a number of later inscriptions339 and they all end up with  the phrase: “and they performed together the other sacrifices that are  due to the gods.” It was during this first tour, too, that at the temple  of Aglauros they took the—very archaic—ephebic oath,340 in which  Aglauros was the first god invoked as witness of the oath, followed by  Hestia, Enua, Enualios, Ares and Athena Areia, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo,  Hegemone, Herakles,341 the borderstones of the fatherland, the wheat,  barley, vines, olive-trees, fig-trees. Especially the participation of  of ephebes “to the border of Attika carrying their weapons, acquiring knowledge of  the territory and the roads. . . . and they visited the sanctuaries in the countryside offer- ing sacrifices on behalf of the people.” See: Chaniotis 2005, 51 f. They also visited  Amphiaraos, which did not belong to Athenian territory at the time (Sineux 2007,  Ch. III), and sacrificed there.  337 Andoc. 1.71 f.; 32 f. 338 But we do not know which temples. Perhaps all of them, perhaps a selection.  Pélékidis 1962, 111, lists various possibilities.  339 Fom the 2nd century BC onwards as for instance IG II2 1006; 1008, 1028; 1029;  1036 etc. In the ephebic oath l.16 (see next note) they are summarized in the phrase  καὶ τιμήσω ἱερὰ τὰ πάτρια. The earliest ephebic inscriptions of the fourth century BC  (O.W. Reinmuth, The Ephebic Inscriptions of the Fourth Century B.C. [Leiden 1971])  are far less elaborate in every respect, including religious references. “In der Zeit, als  die Ephebie noch eine wichtige Einrichtung des attischen Staates war, brauchte man  nich mit vielen Worten zu sagen, was jeder wußte und empfand” (R. Merkelbach,  Aglauros [Die Religion der Epheben], ZPE 9 [1972] 277–283, espec. 283). But Aristo- tle’s testimony suffices as evidence for the ritual circumambulatio. 340 As transmitted by Stob. 4.1.48 and Poll. 8. 105 f., and confirmed by the famous  inscription from the sanctuary of Ares and Athena Areia in Acharnai: L.

Dys. 260 ff., where the son  of an old lady says: My mother was just about to make a sacrifice to some god. I have no  idea which god it was, she does it every day. She goes all around the dis- trict sacrificing (ποιεῖ δὲ το˃θ’ ὁσημέραιż ἔρχεται344 θύουσα τὸν δῆμον  κύκλˎ ǵπαντ’ . . .). “Going all around the city sacrificing”345 is a very satisfactory way of  creating order, a different order, as the old women of Montegrano  knew so much better than their young priest.346 342 In their oath the Amphictyons (Aeschin. 3.109) promise to βοηθήσειν τˑ θεˑ  καὶ τʧ γʧ τʧ ἱερʘ. A treaty between Serdaoi and Sybaris (Staatsverträge II 120.5 ff.)  invokes Zeus, Apollo and the other gods and the city of Poseidonia. An ephebic oath  of Dreros (Crete, Syll.3 527.33–36; Chaniotis 2005, 46 f.) invokes as witnesses a long  list of gods and “sources and rivers and all the gods and goddesses,” which does not  mean that sources and rivers are of the same divine status as the gods, but that they  are just as much part and parcel of the civic identity of the oath takers. Generally on  oaths in treaties of Cretan cities: Chaniotis 1996. Especially on the lists of gods in  oaths: Brulé 2005b. See the discussion in Siewert 1972, who however is not sufficiently  critical with regard to his testimonies. The “eternal fire” in an inscription of 117 BC  (Syll.3 826C. 16) belongs to a different religious context. 343 Cf. also above Aeschylos’ prayer to gods who watch over the Dirce and Isme- nos river. The oath between Hannibal and Philippos is sworn ἐναντίον ποταμῶν καὶ  λιμνῶν καὶ ὑδάτων, which in my view should not be too rashly taken as a Semitic turn  as Barré 1983, 90–93 consistently does. 344 Note that the same verb is used here as in the description of the epheboi. 345 Although one may guess that she belonged to that class of Greeks as typified by  Chaniotis in n. 181 above, she does seem to have literally implemented Plato’s advice  (Leg. IV, 716 B) that the best thing for a good man is “to sacrifice to the gods, to be  in continuous contact with the gods (προσομιλεῖν ἀεὶ τοῖς θεοῖς) through prayers,  votive gifts and the total service paid to the gods.” Whether “she will have satisfied  her appetite as well as her piety” is an (unnecessary) guess that we must leave to the  guesser: R. Osborne, Women and Sacrifice in Classical Greece, in: Buxton 2000, 310.  Anyway, she may be expected to have had her part in the sacrificial meal later in the  Dyskolos. On which see: A.K. Dalby, Siren Feasts: A History of Food and Gastronomy  in Greece (London 1996) 2–5. 346 In the Hellenistic and Roman periods this pious habit of (sometimes on a daily  basis) frequenting the local temples increased greatly and resulted in the creation of  a new verb ἱεροφοιτᾶν (Lat. frequentare templa). See: Veyne 1989, 182 with literature.  Gregory Sifakis tells me that the periphery of many a Greek village is marked by a  chain of protecting little sanctuaries called τὰ σημάδια τοɞ τόπου and that devout  Christians are expected to go and pay reverence to a different saint every day. See  </page> <page sequence="97">  many gods: complications of polytheism 119 We see here representatives of extreme opposites of society—young  men on the brink of full citizenship versus an old woman beyond her  active female functions in the community347—performing the very  same ritual of religious inclusion: the former as a one-day marked rit- ual, the latter as a daily—unmarked but no less ritual—routine. Only  if we take these testimonies to heart can we understand the feelings  of the rural Athenians when forced to evacuate the countryside at the  start of the Peloponnesian war, as evoked by Thuc. 2.16: Deep was their trouble and discontent at abandoning their houses and  the temples at which (right from the time of the ancient constitution)  they and their families had always worshipped (οἰκίας τε καταλείποντες  καὶ ἱερὰ dz διὰ παντὸς Ȓν αὐτοῖς . . . πάτρια) and at having to change their  habits and to bid farewell to what each regarded as his native city.348 It is this type of more personal devotion that leads us to our third  section. 3. Ducking out: gods in personal religiosity ‘My God’: tokens of personal devotion Around 400 BC a certain Archedamos, who had come from Thera  to Attika, put up at the cave of Vari, where he led a secluded exis- tence wholly devoted to the Nymphs.349 Several inscriptions in the  grotto commemorate his pious activities.350 In one of them he is called  a νυμφόληπτος (‘seized by the nymphs’), “on whose instructions he  now on churches at the outskirts of villages (exokklisia) and icon stands (eikonostasia),  their topography and function and their spatial and social interpretations, the funda- mental study by Lucia Nixon, Making a Landscape Sacred.

(and) the laurel” (Ɠαντάλκης ἀνέθεκε τὸ  δέ[νδρον] τὰν δὲ δάφ[ναν] Ƿ[ι] ἑδ’ ἀπ’ ἀέ[θλον] Φάν[ι]π[πος).353 Some  generations later, in the 4th century in the same grotto an inscrip- tion was installed with a hexametric text354 in which—I summarize the  text—the author cordially welcomes the passers-by to this place sacred to the Nymphs and Pan and Hermes,  ruler (anax) Apollo, Herakles and his comrades, the grotto of Chiron  and of Asklepios and Hygieia.

We  cannot be sure about the ‘tree’ and the ‘daphne’. However, the emphasis on trees,  plants and gardening is remarkable in these private cults, as also noticed by M.P.J.  Dillon, The Ecology of the Greek Sanctuary, ZPE 118 (1997) 113–127, espec. 119 f.  One might say that both these ‘hermits’ created their own ‘sacred grove’.

The text next sums up all the blessings Pantalkes received from each  of the gods mentioned and in the end invites everybody: to go up, sacrifice to Pan, pray and delight: for here is the end of all  misery, good will come to you and strife will cease. With these very personal testimonies we have arrived at the extreme  other side of the religious ‘encirclement’ which the polis religion had  to bear with, namely private and personal forms of religion, or rather  devotion. To go by modern textbooks this topic is not particularly  popular in current scholarship.355 It shares this slight with those types  355 M.P. Nilsson, Greek Piety (Oxford 1948) treats all sorts of themes such as justice,  patriotic religion, astrology, monotheism and mystery religions, and spends exactly  two pages on what he calls ‘individualistic religion’ with a few notes on Orphism,  Eleusinian mysteries, Asklepios cult. But in his GGR I 248–52, private religious  expressions receive a generous treatment, with the warning p.250 that they may be  “bescheiden.” (For some other similar initiatives in the middle of the last century see:  Faraone 2008, n. 1.) Yet, in the same period, Festugière 1954, vii, already complained  that “personal religion had been thrown into the shadows in the histories of Greek  religion” since “there is a tendency in our times to emphasize the civic part of this  religion because it is immediately manifest.” Cf. A. Dihle, in: A. Bulloch et alii (edd.),  Images and Ideologies: Self-definition in the Hellenistic World (Berkeley etc. 1993) 291:  “There can be little doubt that minor deities such as heroes, Asclepius, the deities of  the private homestead, had always been of greater importance for the individual in  his everyday life than the powerful and imposing gods and goddesses of the city,”  with reference to Men. Dys. 260 ff., 430 ff. Recent minor textbooks generally follow  the same track. Bruit-Schmitt 1992, 13 f. explain the absence of personal piety in  their work by the extreme scarcity of the evidence. Mikalson 2005 has a chapter on  ‘Greek Religion and the Individual’, but devotes it to impiety, death and afterlife,  subjects which others (e.g. Price 1999) also deal with but not under the caption pri- vate, personal or individual religion. Jost 1992 is alone in devoting a special chapter  to ‘La dévotion personnelle’ and indeed pays attention to the type of personal devo- tion that I discuss in the present section, including the choice for ecstatic or new  and foreign forms of religion. Most recently, St. Instone, Greek Personal Religion: A  Reader (Oxford 2009) returns to the strategy of earlier scholars and focuses almost  exclusively on (high) literary texts, from Homer to Aristotle in his search for personal  contacts of humans and gods (mostly in the form of epiphanies), and relatively great  emphasis on Orphism. With three pages on a ‘real life’ personal contact between man  and gods, viz. the curse tablets, he completes the book without one word on votive  or domestic religion, as we shall discuss below. Recently Dasen &amp; Piérart 2005, have  done much to redress this imbalance in the scholarly interest. In her recent book Les  Grecs et leurs dieux. Pratiques et représentations dans la cité à l’époque classique (Paris  2005) L. Bruit-Zaidman has a section on domestic religion (but cf. below n. 357). For  </page> <page sequence="100"> 122 chapter one of private cults that are variably referred to as houshold, domestic,  or family religion.356 Although these house cults may, rather more  easily than cults of polis or deme, lend themselves to personal forms  of devotion, as does the veneration of the ikons in modern Greek  houses, I leave them out of discussion. Domestic cults like those of  Zeus Herkeios, Zeus Hikesios and others are basically of a communal  nature, even if their execution may be dominated by one member of  the family. Moreover, they are institutionalized and routinized cult  forms and hence not (necessarily) marked by the trait that I consider  essential for what I call private devotion: the element of personal  choice based on an affective predilection. Of course one has to admit that there are relatively few written  sources providing explicit information on personal aspects of Greek  devotional piety. In his Sather Lectures on personal religion among  the Greeks, Festugière 1954 restricted the discussion of popular piety  in classical Greece to his first chapter on Hippolytus (and Artemis) in  the tragedy of that name, to quickly move over to the quest of god in  elevated literature and philosophy, and, next, to the Hellenistic and  Roman periods, where thanks to changes in religious mentalities, the  epigraphic habit, and literary genres such as the novel there is much  more to be found. More recently, Jameson 1999 ranged these aspects  among what he calls ‘the obscure in Athenian Religion’, and left them  out of consideration. In most textbooks on Greek religion one looks in vain for the two  testimonies of very personal, individual and specific devotion with  which I opened the present section. What one keeps bumping into is  a mantra-like repetition in often identical terms of the assertion that  in terms of religion the individual Greek functions only as part of the  late antiquity there is now: K. Bowes, Private Worship, Public Values, and Religious  Change in late Antiquity (Cambridge 2008). And cf. next note. 356 There is nearly no contributor to the recent volume of Bodel &amp; Olyan 2008, the  first book to explore the religious dimensions of the family and the households in  antiquity, who does not endorse its editors in underlining the near total neglect of this  sector of ancient religious culture in modern scholarship. One finds it all summarized  in the words of J.Z. Smith as quoted by K. van der Toorn (ibid. p. 20): “Considered  globally, domestic religion is the most widespread form of religious activity; perhaps  due to its very ubiquity, it is also the least studied. This is especially true of domestic  religion in the past.” The complexity of the terminology (household or family religion)  is touched upon throughout the book. For ancient Greece see: Faraone ibid. 211 ff. </page> <page sequence="101">  many gods: complications of polytheism 123 polis or as part of a group within that polis.357 The consequence may  be that together with the notion of ‘religion’ as a modern construct,  we are also invited to completely eradicate the element ‘private’ within  what we so far have called religion.358 Humphreys 2004, 196: “We need  to problematize our own ideas about the privateness of religion.”359 Not to the extent, one may hope, that we are asked to ignore the  thousands of votive gifts and inscriptions, which, scattered all over the  Mediterranean world and generally dedicated by one or few persons,  are testimonies of, in the most explicit sense of the word, private and  personal religiosity.360 The great majority do not have a written text.  The ones that do, may display the name of the giver, an address to  the deity, and if we are lucky, the reason for the gift, about which,  however, the nature and form of the votive object may also give some  clue. All this is too well-known to need documentation, but I do not  wish to follow modern textbooks in ignoring or underestimating the  topic. Not only because there comes a point where ‘defamiliarizing’  our Greeks degenerates into ‘dehumanizing’ them. My main con- sideration is that here we will get a view of another avenue to cope  357 Cf. Auffarth 1994b, 19 n. 82: “Das Individuum agiert im religiösen Ritual in der  Regel als Teil oder Vertreter einer Gruppe, zumindest der Familie;” Price 1999, 89:  “One should see the individual as a basic unit operating within the overall framework  of the private and public worship of the gods” (but here ‘private’ seems to concern the  family); Sourvinou-Inwood 2000b, 44: “The individual was without doubt the primary,  the basic, cultic unit in polis religion” (my italics); L. Bruit-Zaidman, Le commerce  des dieux. Eusebeia, essay sur la piété en Grèce ancienne (Paris 2001) 13, explicitly  announces that her study on Greek piety will shun “la piété en domaine séparé” since  “l’histoire de la piété est une parti de l’histoire de la cité.” Mikalson 2005, 182: “The  individual is pious and wins the favour (charis) of the gods by following the traditional  customs of his or her own city-state.” See for criticism of these positions D. Boede- ker, in: Bodel &amp; Olyan 2008, 229 f. On such claims as “The oikos is fundamental, the  frame from within which the individual experienced his world, the building block  with which the society of the polis was made,” see the refreshing caveats in Parker  2005, 10–13. 358 As for instance Purvis 2003, 4, with 128 nn. 9 and 10, justly remarks against  Bruit-Schmidt 1992, 14–15. This does not imply that one should underestimate the  complications involved in an attempt to distinguish between ‘state’ and ‘private’  cults. The, hopefully not too bold, distinction that I will adopt is that private cults  (as opposed to domestic or house cults) are based on personal initiative and funding.  They were a matter of personal choice, the initiative (except for permission or control)  not being subject to any intervention by polis or deme. On recent attempts to ban the  term ‘religion’ from historical discourse (and the nonsense of that) see p. 551. 359 She makes this remark, however, in a context far outreaching the present issue.  360 This is not necessarily less true when the dedication of a personal votive gift is  inspired by social motives as for instance in rituals of maturation, initiation, marriage  etc., nor when they are phrased in fixed formulas.  </page> <page sequence="102"> 124 chapter one with the ( potentially) confusing plurality of the polytheistic world:  namely by temporarily (or in few cases permanently) ducking out of  it by focusing on one god as an ‘elect’ centre of religious attention. In  this section I am indebted to a number of important studies by my   former colleagues Harry Pleket and Folkert van Straten.361 Several rel- evant aspects, especially so-called henotheistic tendencies, will receive  a more elaborate treatment in Chapter III. I opened this section with two samples of an extremely ‘singular’  form of personal devotion. Before continuing our search for similar  phenomena in the domain of private cult, it may be expedient to pay  some more attention to the prevalence and impact of the most gen- eral expression of personal devotion: the votive dedication. In giving  a rough idea of the numbers of personal dedications I restrict myself  to the anatomical votives as the most obvious witnesses of personal  (and functional) piety.362 After Rouse 1902, Van Straten 1981 was the  first363 to collect and discuss the ex-votos that had come to his knowl- edge and listed 56 samples of human body parts, mainly from heal- ing centres like those of Asklepios, Amphiaraos, Amynos and Heros  Iatros, not including the epigraphical records mentioning many more.  Subsequently, S.B. Aleshire364 counted the records of 137 dedica- tions365 for the Athenian Asklepieion alone, plus some 200 dedications  361 Pleket 1981; Van Straten 1974, 1981, espec. 94 f.; 1984. I herewith gratefully  commemorate the good times of our co-operation, inter alia resulting in our com- mon (with J.M. Bremer and P.A. Meijer) volume, Versnel 1981a, to which in the same  vein, I contributed ‘Religious Mentality in Ancient Prayer.’ More recently, Purvis 2003  devoted a timely monograph to the evidence of three well-documented private cults  in Classical Greece. 362 This means that I pass over in silence, just to mention one example, the more  than 100,000 little votive lead figurines found in the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at  Sparta (R.M. Dawkins, The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia [London 1929] 249–284) or  the uncountable number of needles, pins, braces for clothes found in sanctuaries all  over Greece, for which see: I. Kilian, Weihungen an Eileithyia und Artemis Orthia,  ZPE 31 (1978) 219–222. 363 On this long period of silence since Rouse’s work his mildly sardonic comments  at p.105 are recommended reading.  364 ‘The Economics of Dedication at the Athenian Asklepieion’, in: T.

Schörner368 treats the Hellenistic and Roman periods, with  for the Greek mainland alone 1240 votive objects bearing an inscrip- tion, and 100 votive reliefs. These collections still do not cover the  total of existent votive objects and inscriptions, and this total, as wit- ness for instance the epigraphical inventories, is only a tiny fraction of  what must have existed before most of them were cleared, destroyed,  thrown away or just got lost.369 All authors mentioned are explicit on  the broad social texture of the dedicants and the more or less even  proportions in gender.370 The cave of Vari, being itself an exceptional sample of a votive gift,  was a centre of lively pious activity. Not only was our nympholeptos  commemorated by later visitors but the grotto has also yielded a host  of the usual modest votive gifts for the nymphs.371 So has the cave,  366 The remarkable discrepancy between the 908 names of worshippers listed in  the temple inventories of the Asklepieion and the 72 names in those of the other  Acropolis inventories (D.

Duncan-Jones, PBSR 31 (1963) 159–177 cal- culated that the number of the ones that have been recovered does not exceed 5% of  what must have been produced in antiquity.  370 This is different with relief dedications in healing sanctuaries with their frequent  focus on the family. Here the dedications by women form a majority and almost  always portray them as members of their family.

Caves, wild places, were by their very nature the home of the nymphs  and their friend Pan,373 gentle and helpful to those who honoured  them, terrifying to those who did not show respect. We saw Socrates  greeting Pan and the Nymphs in a kind and reverential way: “Dear  Pan and you other gods who dwell in this place” during an outing.374 Nor was Archedamos the only nympholeptos. Literary sources  and inscriptions record several others.375 In the Korykian cave in the  mountains of Parnassos, an inscription (SEG 3.406) was dedicated by  a woman who “was seized as she listened to the Nymphs and Pan”  (Νυμφῶν [καὶ] Ɠανὸς κλύουσα [name of the woman] ἐλήφ[θη]). A  certain Appelles son of Apollonios, who dedicated a votive showing  Acheloos, Hermes, and three Nymphai Naiades may have belonged to  the same type, since he calls himself ‘servant of the gods’ (ὑπουργὸς  54; Nilsson, GGR I, 248, 250 f., 805; F.

In a cave at Pitsa 50 km. west of  Korinth painted wooden tablets were found with images of sacrifices  and other votive gifts including statuettes of Pan dating from the 7th  into the 3d c. BC.378 In the literary sources the term nympholeptos occurs in two meanings:  ‘taken by madness’ and ‘inspired (lit. taken/caught) by the nymphs’.  The former, needless to say, tends to be used in a pejorative sense.379 In  cultivated circles these adorants may have been taken as odd, cracked  or zealotic. In a mild tone this glimmers through in the words of the  young man commenting on the religious extravagancies of his mother  in Menander’s Dyskolos (above p. 118), in whom one recognizes some  characteristic traits of Theophrastos’ deisidaimon.380 For our present  discussion it seems preferable to take them as extreme exponents of  an attitude of intimacy and personal devotion to one or a few gods,  which, as a more general phenomenon, comes into view for the first  time in fourth century sources. Recordings of dream visions with divine instructions emerge already  earlier, especially in the context of Pan and the Nymphs. Gradually  their numbers increase, also for other gods,381 as does the inclusion of  divine instructions and commands, which in later votive inscriptions  are accounted for by expressions such as ‘on the instruction of ’ (κατὰ  κέλευσιν, κατὰ πρόσταγμα, κατ’ ἐπιταγήν vel similia), which become  376 Halikarnassos 2nd c.

A dedication to the Nymphs at Koressia (Samos)  by a man called Nymphios (Samos, 2nd/3rd c. AD) suggests, as noted by Chaniotis  (EBGR 2004 no. 104), also a personal devotion to the Nymphs. If this was his name  from birth, it may point to a family tradition of devotion to the Nymphs, as Donald  Mastronarde suggests.  377 R.

V). In Hellenistic and particu- larly Imperial times seeing gods and receiving instructions from gods  assumed epidemic proportions.383 Hand in hand with these dream instructions, it is in the same fourth  century that a decisively hierarchical language emerges in the relations  between men and gods as expressed in terms of submission or even ser- vility on the part of the worshipper (θεραπευτής, ὑπουργός, etc.), and  of sovereignty on the part of the gods (κύριος, δέσποτης etc.).384 We  will discuss this and other elements of this type of religiosity in Chap- ter III and find that, “even before the Hellenistic period we can find  traces of a close affective relationship between deity and worshipper,  i.e. of a serving worshipper having the clear sense of depending on an  imperious deity” (Pleket 1981, 155). Interestingly, terms such as thera- peutes or latris originated as professional terms for temple slavery, but  might acquire a more personal intensification in the sense of personal  devotion to the god. In the Phoenissae of Euripides the Phoenician  women given as slaves to Apollo are described individually as servant  of Phoibos (Φοίβˎ λάτρις). In Euripides’ tragedy named after its pro- tagonist, Ion, who, throughout the tragedy, displays an extraordinary  personal devotion to the god Apollo, was a temple slave (λατρεύων)385  382 See the discussion and rich evidence of these expressions in Van Straten 1976,  13.

In fifth cen- tury literature, however, these are exceptions.386 This attitude of submission receives a striking expression again in the  same 4th century: believers in moments of distress might kneel before  the gods from whom they expected help and whom they implored:  above all healer gods such as Asklepios, but also Artemis, Herakles  Pankrates, the Eleusinian deities. Van Straten 1974 has collected the  evidence, which clearly contradicts the traditional idea that this ges- ture was only introduced under the influence of oriental religiosity.387 Altogether, what we see here are the first signs of the henotheistic  religiosity that we will discuss more extensively in Chapter III. They  are “part of the trend to individualise relationships between men and  the gods.”388 Archedamos and probably also Pantalkes pushed their devotion to  the frontiers by their choice for an eremitic life in cohabitation with  and daily cultic service to the gods of their choice.389 The former indeed  literally ‘moved in’ with the gods.

This much later work (3d c. AD)  strikingly mirrors Archedamos’ personal religiosity in the intimate devotion of a rustic  recluse, inclusive the idyllic garden-ambiance, to the Heros Protesilaos, whose heroon  is next to his own abode and with whom he socializes, meeting him everyday in his  garden and kissing and embracing the hero (Heroikos pp. 131 ff.; 142–145 Kayser).

Another  term for close and steady socializing with (the statue of ) a god is προσομιλεῖν, which  we already met in Plato Leg. IV, 716 B (above n. 345).

As  such these  nympholeptoi are extremes on a gliding scale of religious  involvement. Other founders of private cults did not go as far. Far  from thus detracting from their value as evidence of private religios- ity, they show that such initiatives were not restricted to the category  that Robin Lane Fox, writing on early Christians, once classified as  ‘religious overachievers’. Purvis 2003 gives a good impression of this  category, besides Archedamos also providing an extensive discussion  of two other representatives of private piety. One391 is a woman by the name of Xenokratia, “daughter of Xenia- des and mother of Xeniades,” who founded a sanctuary of Kephisos and dedicated to the gods sharing the  altar (συνβώμοις) this gift in return for instruction (διδασκαλίας τόδε  δῶρον).392 Whoever wishes to is permitted to sacrifice for the fulfilment  of good things. We need not go into detail. The stele with the inscription (c. 400 BC)  has a relief displaying a great number of gods and Xenokratia herself  with her son. Its location together with some other findings, including  another dedicatory inscription, point to a sanctuary near New Phale- ron at the river Kephisos, a place that did not belong to the deme of  the woman. Purvis 32 concludes: The dedication of the shrine helped to secure a favourable and stable  relationship with local divinities, and no doubt with local residents who  390 T.B.

However, there is an identical expression  in an inscription by a girl who dedicated a pinax with pictures of the gods: τόδε δῶρον  διδασκαλίας θύεν τˑ βωλομένˎ ἐπιτελέστων ἀγαθῶν (M.

The second private founder is Xenophon, who, in an excursus in his  Anabasis 5.3.4–11, tells us about the cult for Artemis of Ephesos that  he founded, while in exile, at his estate at Skillos near Olympia in the  Peloponnese in the early fourth c. BC.393 Both land and cult founda- tion were paid for with the sacred money that was set aside as a tithe  for Apollo and Artemis Ephesia by the generals of the Persian expedi- tion after their safe return to Kerasos, a Greek city on the Black Sea.  Xenophon is important as a source since he also reveals his attitudes  about religion in his other writings. Scholars now tend to recognize  his religious attitude as a reflection of traditional Greek piety and con- sider him a model in studies of typical Greek religious convictions and   practice.394 Xenophon describes the foundation as follows (3.5.9): He erected an altar and temple from the sacred money, and ever after- wards, tithing the produce of the land, he sacrificed to the goddess; and  all the citizens and neighbours, men and women shared in the festi- val. The goddess provided to those who pitched their tents there barley,  bread, wine, snacks and desserts, and a share of the animals sacrificed  from the holy pasture and of those taken in the hunt. Further on he lauds the sacred plot as being “full of trees” (11):  “Around the temple itself is planted a grove of trees, which produce  edible fruits in season” (12), once more evoking the ‘utopian’ atmo- sphere of (sacred) groves395 as we already met them in the inscriptions  of Archedamos and Pantalkes.396 Xenophon records (5.3.7) that he “bought land for the goddess  where the god ordained” (τʧ θεˑ ὅπου ἀνεῖλεν ὁ θεός). “The god”  must be Delphic Apollo. So here too the instruction comes from a  god, albeit not in a dream, but more according to official custom, by  393 This can be viewed as a ‘branch cult’ of the Ephesian goddess as mentioned  above n. 311, but in this case a personal one. See: Purvis 2003, 97–100. 394 Thus Purvis p.65. Cf. L. Bruit-Zaidman, o.c. above n. 87. 395 Above. n. 353. But there may be some influence of the Persian paradeisos here  (Purvis 2003, 104).  396 Purvis 2003, 96, aptly adduces a passage from Xen. Mem. 3.8.10, where Socrates  says that “shrines should be very conspicuous and off the beaten path, because such  a site is pleasurable in that it enhances the experience of vision during worship and  encourages pious behaviour of pilgrims as they approach.” Visibility and isolated dis- tance of shrines return as two of the most characteristic markers of outlying shrines  in modern Greece in Nixon o.c. (above n. 346).  </page> <page sequence="110"> 132 chapter one oracle. The benefices bestowed by the goddess on the participants of  the festival surely must have won the cult-founder the gratitude of the  local residents and the concomitant friendly attitude towards the new  resident Xenophon may have been a welcome bonus, as Purvis notes.  But she adds: “The practical benefits of Xenophon’s cult should not  detract from the motives of piety behind the foundation.” We have seen several modes of private devotion in action. Personal  cult foundations on the one hand, personal acts of more modest types  of votive religion on the other. Though related as to the reciprocal  nature of their purposes and expectations, they differ in prestige. In  both varying degrees of personal (material ) advantage may have been  involved, with respect to both gods and fellow humans. Even the hum- blest votive gifts are inter alia exponents of the do ut des principle.  Self-esteem or a craving for social integration may have been a special  concern in these cult foundations. Xenophon’s prestigious initiative  has often been (dis)qualified as a token of self-interest under the veil  of piety. After all, being a foreigner in exile, it was important for him  to obtain a Sitz im Leben amidst the local residents. A similar motive  may have played a role for Xenokrateia whose deme of origin was not  that of her foundation. And the same most pertinently pertained to the  allochthonous Archedamos who sought a place for himself by settling  with the (Attic) nymphs. But what should interest us at this point is, first, that all these devo- tional initiatives, even those inspired by ritual wont or familial tradi- tion, are individual, solitary acts presupposing personal decision and  choice. This, of course, is most obvious in the case of a cult foundation  or the initiative to organize a religious festival. They are less, but only  relatively less, so in acts of common votive piety. In cases of serious ill- ness it is up to the patient or the close relatives to decide on questions  of whether and when a pilgrimage is in order, and to make a choice  concerning the god and place best equipped for the medical  operation.  Even an outing to Pan or the Nymphs in their caves may involve plan- ning, preparation and sometimes considerable effort,397 and hence  397 Many of the caves were situated in mountainous areas, difficult to reach or with  complicated access. See e.g. the recently recovered Cave of Pan at Marathon: E. Lupu,  The Sacred Law from the Cave at Marathon (SEG 36.267), ZPE 137 (2001) 119–124,  with earlier literature. In order to be effective, ritual or cultic acts, especially those  of the nature of votive actions, require effort and energy on the part of the worship- per, as is well argued by F.T. Naerebout, Spending Energy as an Important Part of  Ancient Greek Religious Behaviour, Proceedings of the International Symposium on  </page> <page sequence="111">  many gods: complications of polytheism 133 requires a personal and often individual decision. Indeed, much of this  type of private devotion tends to be focused on gods and places outside  the centre of the polis, eccentric little rural sanctuaries (Pan, Nymphs)  or distant centres of pilgrimage (Asklepios, Amphiaraos).398 The sec- ond, and major, point relevant to the present issue is that, contrary to  collective rituals such as regular sacrifices of polis, deme, phratry or  family-group, the type of devotion under discussion presupposes an  individual’s special pious focus on one ‘elect’ god. If some circumstances and expressions of personal devotion dis- cussed so far betray a touch of ‘eccentricity,’ also in the spatial sense of  that word, this does not imply that private acts and places of worship,  including private sanctuaries, did not occur in city centres. They did,399  and in abundance, just as did private sacrificial celebrations (τὰ ἱερὰ  τὰ ἰδιωτικά as opposed to τὰ δημόσια [LSA no. 73, 6]).400 Xenophon’s  foundation has been classified as the first of many Kultstiftungen401  which could be located anywhere on private lots or even on common  ground but which were liable to official authorization and surveyance  Ancient Mediterranean World, 16–18 April 2004 at the University of Tokyo = Kodai,  Journal of Ancient History 13/14 (2003/2004) [2007] 9–18. This is especially apparent  in pilgrimage as argued by I. Rutherford, Theoric Crisis: The Danger of Pilgrimage in  Greek Religion and Society, SMSR 61 (1995) 275–292, with the conclusion: “the idea  that pilgrimage is risky can be seen as part of a system of beliefs on which its value in  society is grounded.” On the importance of remoteness see: A.

One very remarkable, exceptionally well  documented private foundation would not have come off badly in her book. I mean  the temple and cult for Aphrodite at Delos founded by a prominent citizen Stesileos  (late 4th c. BC). The cult named after him was continued by his descendants into  the second century and was a serious rival of the official Delian Aphrodite cult. See:  C.

BC) as a peculiar token  of private religious initiative, see most recently: Graf o.c.

They could even harm other private sacred  properties.403 More generally they might also interfere with the general  religious interests of the polis. It is this concern that made Plato Leg.  10.909d propose a law that no man shall possess a shrine in his private house (ἐν ἰδίαις οἰκίαις);  when a man feels himself moved to offer sacrifice, he shall go to the pub- lic temples (πρὸς τὰ δημόσια ἴτω) for that purpose and deliver his offer- ings to the priests of either sex whose business is to consecrate them.404 In the ensuing passage (Leg. 10.909e–910a) he gives the reason for his  proposal. It proves that reality might differ from the ideal that he had  in mind:405 It is customary for all women especially, and for people who are in any  way sick, in peril, or in distress, whatever the nature of the distress, and  conversely, when they have just obtained some way out of their prob- lems, to dedicate whatever is at hand at the time, vow to offer sacrifices  and promise to found shrines for gods and demi-gods and children of  gods. As they recall the frequent visions they saw while awake because  of their fear, or those sent in their dreams, they provide a remedy for  each individually by founding altars and sanctuaries, and with them fill  all homes, villages, open spaces, and any place they happen to have had  such experiences.406 There can be no doubt that these types of private cults, in or adjacent  to the house or at nearby private plots were rife in 4th century Athens.  It also appears that founding such cults was not restricted to  foreigners  402 For healthy doubts about the stringency of its application see: Parker 1996,  216.  403 For the last see: J.D. Sosin, Unwelcome Dedications: Public Law and Private  Religion in Hellenistic Laodicea by the Sea, CQ 55 (2005) 130–139. For the first ibid.  132 f., with the relevant literature.  404 Bremmer 1994, 92 f. adds: “It is highly interesting to note that according to Plato  this ‘privatization’ of religion apparently went hand in hand with a growing interest  in magic (11.933a).” 405 Earlier, in Leg.5.738b–c, he had already complained that people, often “follow- ing visions or inspirations from the gods” institute sacrifices with various rituals and  for such reasons dedicate statues, altars, temples, and they mark off a portion of land  for each. 406 Translations partly by Purvis 2003, 7–10, where see a discussion of these private  foundations. </page> <page sequence="113">  many gods: complications of polytheism 135 but that local residents, both metics and citizens, had their share407 as  well, quite apart from their more institutionalized cults of the tradi- tional house gods.408 However, the majority of these sanctuaries, altars,  and ‘the forest of idols’ that Paul still observed at Athens,409 have  vanished together with the buildings to which they belonged. When  recovered, their anonymity usually tends to veil their true nature. All these private cults are characterized by more or less intense,  more or less temporary, more or less spontaneous, but always personal  attention focussed on an ‘elect’ god. If, as we shall argue in Chapter  III, hymns to a god may be called ‘henotheistic moments in a poly- theistic context’, that expression is even more appropriate to personal  prayer in the private religiosity under discussion. During these periods  of intensified communication and indeed socialization a god becomes  ‘the god’. As such the deity may be elected as “among all the gods  the only one whom he really worshipped and honoured” (ȯν μόνον  πάντων θεῶν ἀληθῶς προσεκύνει τε κἀτίμα, Babrios 20).410 In more  general terms Hippolytus (Eur. Hipp. 104) expresses the same idea:  “each person will care for another god or man” (ἄλλοισι ἄλλος θεῶν τε  κἀνθρώπων μέλει). We have seen and will see again that in the  context  407 A parallel may be found in the private foundations of chapels in modern Greece  (not seldom inspired by dreams and visions, as in antiquity: Ch. Stewart, Dreams and  the Devil: Moral Imagination in Modern Greek Culture [Princeton 1991] 83–91) by an  individual or a family for ‘their own’ Saint, with the concomitant pious maintenance,  the irregular periodical acts of private devotion and the regular public services on the  Saint’s name-day. 408 See for the gods of the house like Hestia, Zeus Ktesios, Zeus Herkeios, Apollo  Aguieus, Hekate, Hermes: Parker 2005, 13–20; Brulé 2005a, and on Zeus Herkeios and  Ktesios in particular Appendix II n. 5. As heros/theos geiton (below p. 136 f.) especially  the latter three of them may have enjoyed personal devotion as well, as we have seen,  and will see again in Chapter IV.  409 “The city full of idols:” Acts 17:16. Cf. R.E. Wycherley, Minor Shrines in Ancient  Athens, Phoenix 24 (1970) 283–295. 410 There is a nice parallel of a somewhat different nature in the so-called ‘oath of the  Isis mysts’, that we posses in two versions (P.S.I. 1162 and 1290 = Totti 1985, nos. 8b  and 8a) as elucidated by R. Merkelbach, Der Eid der Isismysten, ZPE 1 (1967) 55–73.  The initiand swears an oath by the almighty god Osiris, whose omnipotent qualities  are enlarged upon, but ends up with the phrase: ἐπόμνυμαι δὲ καὶ οȻς π[ροσκυνῶ θ] εοɞς συντηρήσειν καὶ φυλά[ξειν] (but I also swear by the gods whom I worship that  they assist [the great god] in keeping an eye on and watching the oath). Similar com- binations of one great god and a (no less powerful) local one, believed to be a personal  patron, is quite common in Egyptian prayers and perseveres in Christian texts E.g.  P.Harr. (1936) 54 and P.Oxy. 1926, δέσποτα μου θεὲ παντοκράτωρ καὶ ǵγιε Φιλόξενε  πρόστατα μου (also in: NDIEC 2 [1982] 40 f., and cf. the texts collected in: A.S. Hunt  &amp; C.C.

Samia 444, “dearest Apollo” χαῖρ’, Ἄπολλον  φίλτατε),411 but also and often for the same reason with supplicatory  deferential titles such as ἄναξ or κύριε. A votive inscription “for my  health/recovery” from Lisos (Crete)412 is dedicated to κυρίˎ Ǹσκληπίˎ  καὶ τʧ κυρίʕ ɀγείʕ. In such circumstances even little neighbour Agu- ieus may be addressed with elevated titles: καὶ σɞ Φοῖβ’ ἄναξ Ǹγυιε˃  and in Ar. Vesp. 875: Ɋ δέσποτ’ ἄναξ, γεῖτον Ǹγυιε˃. The presence of the god in effigie (as a statue or in a dream) no  doubt fostered the intimate, emotional atmosphere of personal com- munication. We have observed the central role of proximity in the  case of deities like Pan and the Nymphs in rural areas as indicated  with deictic locatives, one person in Menander even being called τˑδε  γείτων τˑ θεˑ (neighbour to the god), as well as comparable expres- sions in an urban ambiance for e.g. Apollo Aguieus. A personal rela- tionship between man and god is not least induced by contiguity.413  Hence, most of the gods and heroes that we have met in this section  may qualify for inclusion into the category of the heros/theos geiton.  Among Greeks, as in other pre-industrial cultures, a good relationship  with the neighbour was of paramount importance.414 This is not differ- ent between man and god as several expressions concerning gods or  heroes as highly valued neighbours testify.415 411 On φίλος in prayer or other addresses to a god see: Pulleyn 1997, 199 n. 9. 412 A. Martínez Fernández, ZPE 145 (2003) 131 ff. (2nd c. BC). 413 Cf. Ar. Vesp. 389–394, where Philokleon prays to the hero Lykon, with the words  “Oh Lord Lykos, my neighbour hero (Λύκε δέσποτα, γείτων ȑρως). . . . now pity and  rescue your very own neighbour” (Lykos’ shrine was next to a lawcourt, the second  home of the ‘professional’ juror Philokleon). In one of her many refreshing, empathic  and informative studies, ‘Athanatous therapeuein. Réflexions sur des femmes au ser- vice des dieux’, in: Dasen &amp; Piérart 2005, 69–82, St. Georgoudi touches on this aspect  of close neighbourhood between goddess and women and its consequences, especially  in the case of the kleidouchos, the woman who keeps the key of the sanctuary (pp.  80 f.), and promises a study on these “relations intimes qui se tissent entre la divinité  et la personne qui se voue à son service,” the result of which can be that “les deux  entités s’identifient, deviennent interchangeables, en abolisant ainsi la ligne de sépara- tion entre le divin et l’humain.” We are reminded here of the special case of Ion, which  after all may not have been so exceptional at all.  414 On the emotional and social aspects of neighbourhood see: W. Schmitz, Nach- barschaft und Dorfgemeinschaft im archaischen und klassischen Griechenland (Berlin  2004) passim, espec. 52–59; 160 f. 415 Rusten 1983 gives a selection and discusses several prayers expressing gratitude or  request to this type of heroes or gods. Bremmer 1994, 31 in this connection points out  the importance of theophoric names with the element geiton (e.g. Athanogeiton), which  also may be suggestive of a personal relationship with a god. Cf. Parker 2000, 62. </page> <page sequence="115">  many gods: complications of polytheism 137 Among the familiar addresses to a god φίλε, φίλτατε prevails.416   Predicates that express a personal relationship occur as well. In an  inscription of Pergamon (2nd c. BC), for instance, on a statuette of the  mother of the gods, the dedicant calls the goddess τὴν ἰδίαν προστάτιν  ‘his own guardian’.417 We have encountered names of gods specified  with a person’s name in the genitive (e.g. Men Tiamou, above n. 152)  indicating probably the person who has founded a cult of that god  and thus may boast a special relationship with him.418 However, “the  bond between a man and a god never becomes so close that it could  be expressed by a singular possessive pronoun: Greeks do not pray  ‘my god!’ as Hittites and Hebrews do.”419 So, from a terminological  point of view the title of the present sub-section may seem to be a  misnomer. From a conceptual viewpoint, however, it appears to be  fully justified. 416 Burkert 1996b, 9 f. 417 Van Straten 1981, 104 n. 192, with a few more samples of this type. 418 They are found mostly in Asia Minor in Imperial times. Similar combinations  in Roman areas of the type Silvanus Curtianus (L. Maio, L’ara di Silvanus Curtianus  presso Benevento, RAL 31 [1976] 291–295) abound: Nock 1972, I, 41; cf. 156 f.; Bömer  III (1961), 444 = (202) n. 7; C.P. Jones, The Plancii of Perge and Diana Planciana,  HSCPh 80 (1976) 231–237. For classical Greece one might adduce the theophoric  names (especially those with the suffix -dotos or -doros) as evidence for a personal  bond of the parents of the so-named with one particular god. As the name is often  hereditary in a family, as well as for other reasons, this argument is doubtful. See the  important discussion in Parker 2000. It may be different, I would suggest, in the case  of names such as Theophilos, Theodoros, Philotheos, on which see Parker 2000, 78 f.  The element theo- can hardly refer to ‘the gods’ and must rather hint at a certain  god, who however is not named. Why not? Because he is ‘my or our [one and only]  god’? Interestingly, F. Mora, Nomi teofori e politeismo greco: prospettive di ricerca,  in: G. Sfameni Gasparro (ed.), Ǹγαθὴ Ȇλπίς. Studi storico-religiosi in onore di Ugo  Bianchi (Roma 1994) 177–186, in a brief but full survey of the structure of theophoric  names and their distribution in various periods, notes that composites with θεός (and  Apollon, and Ɠυθ-) become very popular in the 4th century. 419 Thus, Burkert 1985, 274, showing that the few apparent exceptions are of a dif- ferent type. He elaborated his views in Burkert 1996b, 3–14. The Athenian Diophan- tos sought Asklepios’ assistance, emphasising both the god’s unique power (μόνος εȢ  σύ, μάκαρ θεῖε, σθένων) and his personal devotion (ὅπως σ’ἐσίδω, τὸν ἐμὸν θεόν)  (IG II2 4514), but then we are in the second century AD.

That is by joining one of the  private religious associations that come into view in the 4th century  and  mushroomed in the Hellenistic period and later.420 We know little  about the religious calibre of all those groups of orgeones, thiasotai,  eranistai etc. As they often have the nature of a dining and drinking- club the members’ social interests may have outrivaled religious zeal.421  We will restrict ourselves here to the congregations that gathered in  the cults of ‘new and/or foreign gods’422 (who sometimes were either  less foreign or less new—or both—than handbooks make us believe).423  Cults and adherents of Cybele, Bendis and Sabazios and a few other  less prominent immigrants, make their appearance in 4th century  sources. As far as the evidence allows us to see these congregations  420 There is a very useful discussion with a full list of Athenian associations in  Parker 1996, Appendix 4, 333–342, with references to more detailed discussions of  separate associations elsewhere in the book. The issue recently regained its place in  the centre of scholarly interest. I single out I.N. Arnaoutoglou, Thusias heneka kai  sunousias. Private Religious Associations in Hellenistic Athens (Athens 2003), with the  three 4th c. priestesses (below n. 426) at 91–94. 421 Not always, however. D. Brabant, Persönliche Gotteserfahrung und religiöse  Gruppe: die Therapeutai des Asklepios in Pergamon, in: A. Gutsfeld &amp; D.-A. Koch  (edd.), Vereine, Synagogen und Gemeinden im kaiserzeitlichen Kleinasien (Tübingen  2006) 61–75, argues that the exclusiveness of the association of Therapeutai for Askle- pios at Pergamum did not rest on the social status but rather on the personal religious  experience of their members such as Aelius Aristides and Galenos, who maintained  close devotional ties with the deity. Of course, one motive does not exclude the other.  On Aristides’ Asklepios-devotion see: A. Petsalis-Diomidis, Truly beyond wonders:  Aelius Aristides and the cult of Asklepios (Oxford 2010). 422 In TER UNUS 102–131, I have devoted an extensive discussion to these gods, the  nature of their cults, their impact on sections of the Athenian population and the reac- tions they provoked among the authorities of the polis. Important studies published  since are: Garland 1992; Bremmer 1994 (brief summary of the main characteristics);  C.

And see below n. 426. 423 In his discussion of the ‘New Gods’ (see preceding note) Parker warns against  sloppy labels. The gods Pan and Asklepios (on the entry at Athens of the latter see  most recently: Riethmüller I, 2005, 241–250; Wickkiser 2008, Ch. 4) came to Athens  in the early and late 5th century respectively. Though acknowledged as Greek gods, in  the eyes of the Athenians they yet were xenikoi theoi. Cybele had a complex migratory  history, she is attested in Greece already in the 6th century and received a sanctuary  at Athens in the 5th. See most recently: M.H. Munn, The Mother of the Gods, Athens,  and the Tyranny of Asia: A Study of Sovereignty in Ancient Religion (CUP 2006).  </page> <page sequence="117">  many gods: complications of polytheism 139 differ from the established cult types in that they were entered by free  choice, that at least some of them are marked by ecstatic behaviour and  that they recruited their clientèle predominantly among women.424 The  most revolutionary and least debatable novelty was that the adherents  did not make a secret of their exclusive affection425 for one god. This  was probably the main reason why they were suspected as a poten- tial threat to the religious stability and the nomoi of the polis. Suspi- cion and hostility provoked stigmatization, which of course may have  had a distorting effect on the scanty evidence we have. It is beyond  doubt, however, that stigmatization in its turn provoked repression  and indeed led to the prosecution of (at least) three ‘priestesses’, two  of whom were executed. According to our (late) sources, the accusa- tions included: ‘assembling thiasoi’, ‘making love potions’, ‘mocking  the mysteries’, ‘initiating in rites of foreign gods’, ‘dealing in drugs and  charms’, ‘impiety’. Introducing foreign cults and the suspicion of prac- ticing magic are, throughout antiquity, two sides of one medal and at  Athens might provoke an asebeia process of which there were several  in the 4th c. Most notorious is the one against Socrates on accusations  not unrelated to the ones just mentioned.426 424 We must realize, however, that practically without exception our sources repre- sent the negative image constructed by male observers. Bremmer 1994 91 f., tends to  emphasize female interest. Parker, with reference to TER UNUS 121 n. 101, is more  cautious on this point. On another modern assumption, namely “the scholarly ten- dency to see the new gods, and especially those with ecstatic rites, as the sort of thing  the lower classes might be more prone to indulge in,” Allan 2004, 126 comments that  “it betrays the same misconceptions that have long obscured the prevalence of ‘magic’  at all levels of ancient Greek society.”  425 Unique ‘affection’ by no means implies refusal to pay reverence to the gods of  the polis. See Chapter III p. 244 on the definition of henotheism. 426 See TER UNUS 115–118 for the ‘priestesses’; 123–130 for asebeia processes  including the one against Socrates, where I argue for a relationship between the   indictments against Socrates and those against the priestesses of the new cults. Parker  1996, 199–217, espec. 214–217, after a judicious discussion, very close to mine, seems  to endorse this view.

In TER UNUS 131–172 I offered an analysis  of the nine most noticeable characteristics of the new god, his priest,  the Maenadic retinue, and especially the religious mentality of his fol- lowers. They include the following features. The new god is extolled as  greater than any other god, and hence claims reverence by all mortals,  in Greece and, indeed, throughout the world. His followers magnify  his greatness in acclamations and hymns, and revere him while pro- fessing their own humility. His major blessing is the happiness shared  by anyone who follows him. The one who refuses to worship the invin- cible god is excessively punished. In the end the onlookers admit their  error in not having acknowledged the unique quality of the ‘new’ god;  they repent and praise the god. Particularly striking are the extravagant praises of the god’s unique  superiority, the chorus extolling him as ‘the foremost of the blessed  ones’ (377 f.), ‘not less than any of the gods’ (777), and with the accla- mation: δέσποτα δέσποτα (583). The most outrageous of them all,  “Dionysos, Dionysos, not Thebes has power over me” (1037/8), is an  undisguised proclamation of an escapist and indeed deviational atti- tude, that cannot but have been shocking in the ears of its Athenian  audience. Altogether the total picture just sketched is unmatched in earlier  Greek literature, where one may encounter single elements but never  a consistent and coherent complex such as the one of the Bacchae.427  427 Myths such as those of Tantalos, Sisyphos, are of a quite different nature.  R. Osborne, The Ecstasy and the Tragedy: Varieties of Religious Experience in Art,  Drama, and Society, in: Pelling 1997, 187–211, espec. 189, first, in his own words,  makes “a caricature” of the core of my argument and next argues that this carica- ture should be rejected, a method which in its candidness introduces a novelty in  scholarly criticism. Worse, his caricature turns out to be a wilful misrepresentation  of my argument. For an answer to Osborne I refer to my ‘Heis Dionysos!—One Dio- nysos? A Polytheistic Perspective, in: R. Schlesier (ed.), A Different God? Dionysos  and Ancient Polytheism (Berlin forthcoming 2011). For the moment I recommend  the well-considered conclusion of another reader concerning the relationship between  tragedy and historical reality, Allan, 2004, 148: “Yet the poet’s very decision to include  such features (viz. the characteristics of contemporaneous religious phenomena HSV)  tells us much about their audience’s shared religious attitudes.” At p. 131 Alan quotes  a passage from the tragedy Semele by Diogenes of Athens (Athen. 14.636A = TGF I 45  F 1.1–6) which shows a ‘syncretism’ of Dionysos’ and Cybele’s devotees, very similar  </page> <page sequence="119">  many gods: complications of polytheism 141 This enhances the probability that the Bacchae represents the first  reflection of—and on—the phenomenon of new cults of ‘foreign’ gods  with their ‘sectarian’ deviation from routinized forms of religion, devi- ant above all in their explicit professions of a structural ‘adversion’428  to one unique god. Our evidence grants us not more than scanty  glimpses of the creed, myth and ritual of these cults, but in their dis- tinctly henotheistic nature they certainly foreshadowed Hellenistic  and later forms of religiosity429 focussed on a unique and all-powerful  god, who was acclaimed with εἷς θεός ‘one (is the) god’. The nine  characteristics that I traced in the Bacchae are all matched in the reli- gious expressions of these later henotheistic cults as I shall sketch in  more detail in Chapter III. The fact that the earliest acclamation that  to the one in the Bacchae of his contemporary Euripides. This means that “Euripides  was not alone in combining Dionysac myth and cult with that of the new gods.” And  cf. below n. 431. 428 The term was introduced by Nock 1933 to distinguish this type of surrender to  henotheistic forms of belief from the (rare) conversion to a monotheistic creed (for  which see Chapter III). However, these types of adversion do involve features that  William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience (London 1902) Chs. 9 and 10,  lists as characteristics of conversion: “a passion of willingness, a perception of new  truths, a clean and beautiful newness within and without, an ecstasy of happiness,  often with hallucinatory sensation.”  429 Mikalson 1998, very much leaning on inscriptional evidence, attempts to dem- onstrate a high degree of continuity in Athenian religion during the Hellenistic period,  a useful (though not surprisingly new) corrective to dominant assumptions, and as  such widely welcomed and praised by critics. On the other hand, several critics betray  doubts with regard to his tendency, against a general scholarly view, to deny or at least  downplay novel religious initiatives in this period. In a discussion of my ‘nine features  of henotheistic religion’ M. correctly notes that in our (epigraphical) sources they do  not occur prior to the imperial era (as I explicitly admitted myself ). His inference  that hence there was practically nothing of the kind in the Hellenistic period neces- sarily must smooth over the literary evidence of new cults and types of religiosity in  the fourth century BC that are at issue here, as well as the remarkable henotheistic  traits in the Asklepios cult that we will discuss in the 5th Chapter. Here his restric- tions as to place (Athens), time (beginning in the later fourth c.) and privileged type  of evidence practically preclude a balanced judgement. Space does not allow a detailed  discussion here. I refer to relevant critical notes in (generally positive) reviews such as  in ClAnt 68 (1999) 459 (private cults); CW 93 (1999) 215 (curse tablets); CR 50 (2000)  125 (ruler cult). Most thoughtful, explicit and to the point is L. Albinus, in: Gnomon  73 (2001) 315–319, who details his theoretical and methodical objections (in a way  comparable to that of other critics on M’s earlier works) to M.’s approach concluding:  “One might be entitled to ask if he is adequately equipped to criticise Versnel’s dem- onstration of changing principles in orientation, based as it is on the interpretation  of a literary tradition.” To which I would only add one of the many items of helpful  methodological advice in Salins 1995, namely to avoid the logical fallacy of converting  an absence of evidence into the evidence of an absence.  </page> <page sequence="120"> 142 chapter one comprises the word εἷς, namely ‘Heis Dionysos’,430 stems from a Bacchic  milieu certainly does nothing to discourage the idea that Euripides’  Bacchae displays henotheistic features. The best I can do is to quote  the conclusion of a scholar who more recently launched a meticu- lous search for references to ‘new gods’ in Greek tragedy and whose  results may reinforce our confidence in the reliability of other literary  information:431 In this way the Bacchae captures perhaps better than any other docu- ment of Greek religion the feelings of fifth-century Greeks as they con- templated these non-Olympian and non epic-deities: such powers are  new to our polis and its religious and mythological traditions, but their  rites are immemorial and demand recognition and respect. This is not  to deny the evidence that the new gods were regarded with suspicion by  some (or treated as suspicious in order to make a rhetorical point), but  at the same time we should beware lest the relative literary and mythi- cal poverty of the new gods leads us to neglect or deny their religious  importance. This is also a perfect conclusion to the present section in general. Let  us not neglect or deny the religious importance of those tokens of  private religiosity that we have briefly discussed. Revealing one more  way of coping with the plurality of Greek theology, they are far more  significant than is generally acknowledged. 4. Conclusions We started our explorations into the question of order versus chaos  with three Greek doubts: one concerning the identity of an appear- ing god, the second with regard to the question of which god should  be approached for different needs and occasions, and the third  430 3d c. BC but no doubt going back to the 4th. See below p. 302. 431 Allan 2004, 146, concluding: “As H.S. Versnel has shown in his magisterial study  of Dionysiac ambiguities, the Bacchae reflects contemporary uneasiness concerning  new cults and their ecstatic worship.” Earlier Bremmer 1994, 91 f. largely accepted  my theory. Parker 1996, 198, while referring to “Versnel’s striking study of the Bac- chae” decides that “the questions rests” on the questions whether the ecstatic cults  were places of ‘sectarian, missionary enthusiasm’ and whether “turning to Sabazios or  Mother entail in any degree a turning away from other gods.” However in an adden- dum to his p. 192 n. 144 he notes that recent finds of funerary monuments of devotees  in the Cybele cult may change the image and entail a more positive judgement. Cf. in  the same vein Ch. Segal, Dionysiac Poetics and Euripides’ Bacchae. Expanded edtion  (Princeton 1997) 352 f; 359. </page> <page sequence="121">  many gods: complications of polytheism 143 concerning the complications involved in divine nomenclature. The  aim of these explorations was to provide a first insight into the com- plexity inherent in a polytheistic system. And although in all three  samples Greeks were shown to have searched for tools to cope with  the confusing multitude of their gods, at various points in all three  they also had to give in. Divine names and epithets led us medias in res. Were gods with the  same name but different epithets perceived as different aspects of one  god or as different personae? Was Zeus Herkeios Zeus? Were Zeus  Basileus and Zeus Meilichios one and the same god or not? Modern  opinions appeared to be diametrically opposed. I have argued that both  options may be true, but never at the same time. A multiperspective  view allowed the Greek to cope with the ambiguity by shifting from  one point of view to the other, depending on what the context, focus,  discourse or frame of mind required. Local gods, as most exemplarily represented by the gods worshipped  by each polis (and its chora), together formed a local pantheon, thus  generating many local, relatively isolated, pantheons, one differing  from the other not only in their composition, but also in that gods  with the same name but belonging to different cities were not (nec- essarily) perceived as being the same gods. The Hera of Samos was  another persona than the Hera of Argos. Here place articulates dis- tinctions that we earlier saw expressed by the epithet and the func- tion it referred to. In other words, identity is now defined by elements  of place and time. On the other hand, as we next briefly discussed,  there is always the pantheon of Hellas, as gloriously represented in  the works of Homer and Hesiod and visualized in tragedy. The two  systems, local and national, may clash, but rarely do, since listening to  or reading Homer or attending a tragedy takes the participants into  another world, a world far more distant, sublime and awesome than  everyday reality where sacrifices are made and prayers are addressed to  the local gods who are ‘right here’. Many pantheons, many horizons. Finally, side by side with the common religion of polis or deme, we  descry moments or periods of personal devotional affection focussed  on an ‘elect’ god in private cult, in votive religion, at centres of pil- grimage, in congregations round new or foreign gods. In all of them  the intimacy between men and god might turn the latter into ‘my god’,  even if this was not the terminology used to mould this type of relation- ship. It was the most radical, but largely hidden, hence  undervalued,  </page> <page sequence="122"> 144 chapter one form of coping with the confusing reality of polytheism, namely by  just (temporarily) ducking out of it. In Appendix I we shall consider a different way of ordering gods,  viz. the construction of grand totals such as ‘all the gods’ or ‘the twelve  gods’. In these systems one clearly recognizes an elementary form of  creating order. Nonetheless, they were soon put into jeopardy by their  frequent union with one or a few individual gods who, being them- selves traditional members of the ‘twelve’ and more obviously of ‘all  the gods’, already formed part of those collectives. Nor are these the  only attempts at imposing order on the complicating multiplicity of  polytheism. Gods can be ranged in many different ways, which may  be mutually incompatible. Some of them, such as mythical grouping,  local clustering, or totalizing into pantes theoi or dodeka theoi, are  devices created by the Greeks themselves. About others scholars may  disagree. I just mention the two most topical ones. On the one hand  there is the classification of gods into the two categories Olympian  and chthonian, a distinction on whose authenticity an ongoing debate  is raging,432 and, on the other hand, the distinction between central/ 432 This hallowed distinction associated with the names of Creuzer, K.O. Müller, and  Jane Harrison, and still applied as a structural model in Burkert’s handbook, is often  assimilated with the distinction between Olympian versus Heroic types of sacrifice.  R. Schlesier, Olympian versus Chthonian Religion, SCI 11 (1991/1992) 38–51 (Ger- man version in: R. Schlesier, Kulte, Mythen und Gelehrte. Anthropologie der Antike  seit 1800 [Frankfurt a. M 1994] 21–32), questions its authenticity as an ancient Greek  distinction. The cultic differentiation between Olympian and chthonian sacrifice has  been put to question by various specialists, to begin with A.D. Nock, The Cult of  Heroes, HTR 37 (1944) 141–174 (= Essays II 575–602), and more recently especially  by Ekroth 2002 and 2008, introducing a division between high-intensity and low- intensity rituals (see 2002, 328 f. and 2008, 90 f.). Briefly also Rudhardt 1958, 251 ff.;  R.C.T. Parker, art. “chthonian gods” in: OCD3 (1996), 330. A sophisticated plea for  the defence in: S. Scullion, Olympian and Chthonian, ClAnt 13 (1994) 75–119, and  idem, Heroic and Chthonian Sacrifice: New Evidence from Selinous, ZPE 132 (2000)  163–171. The latter study takes into account the important lex sacra from Selinous  recently discovered (Jameson e.a. 1993) in which the Tritopatores in their impure  condition receive sacrifices “as to the heroes,” and in pure state “as to the gods.” As in  some other leges sacrae this seems to imply that gods may shift from a chthonic/heroic  into an Olympian identity in a sequence of sacrificial celebrations, comparable to the  much discussed Herakles of Thasos (Hdt. 2.44.4). This, then, would be an analogy  to the shifting between divine identities as discussed in the present chapter. On the  notorious question about the double identity of Herakles see recently: A. Verbanck- Piérard, Le double culte d’Héraklès: légende ou réalité? in: A.-F. Laurens (ed.), Entre  hommes et dieux. Le convive, le héros, le prophète (Paris 1989) 43–64; E.J. Stafford,  Héraklès: encore et toujours le problème du heros-theos, Kernos 18 (2005) 391–406.  On the implications of the Selinous text see also the contributions of A. Henrichs and  R.C.T.

Alroth (edd.),  </page> <page sequence="123">  many gods: complications of polytheism 145 normal on the one hand and eccentric/eccentral/marginal gods on  the other, a classification adopted as the format of the section “Gods  orderly and ‘disorderly’” in Bremmer 1994, 15–23.433 It was impossible to deal with all these classifications in the present  book. Generally one may observe that the plague of what I would call  ‘binary disease’ or ‘bipolar infection’ has been endemic among schol- ars long before structuralism made its appearance. According to the  Greek Sacrificial Ritual, Olympian and Chthonian: Proceedings of the Sixth Interna- tional Seminar on Ancient Greek Cult, 25–27 April 1997 (Stockholm 2005), with the  important review of this book and of Georgoudi 2005 by G. Ekroth in Kernos 20  (2007) 387–399. Another light on the Olympian-chthonian dilemma: Chr.A. Faraone,  The Collapse of Celestial and Chthonic Realms in a Late Antique “Apollonian Invo- cation” (PGM I 262–347), in: R.S. Boustan &amp; A.Y. Reed (edd.), Heavenly Realms and  Earthly Realities in Late Antique Religions (Cambridge 2004) 213–232.  433 If the Olympian-chthonian opposition is a product of Romanticist scholarship,  the opposition central-marginal has its roots in more recent anthropological theory,  especially the one concerned with initiatory myth and ritual, which, in classical stud- ies, gained ground in the sixties of the last century. I have given my appraisal of this  movement in Versnel 1993, 60–74, arguing that the concept of marginality (which I  have eagerly used in my own research) may be useful and indeed revealing on con- dition that it is clearly and cautiously defined. If not, the elasticity of the concept  entails fatal arbitrariness (see against the sloppy use of the concept ‘initiation’ the  important and honest reassessment by one of the initiators of initiation studies in  the classical field, F. Graf, Initiation: A Concept with a Troubled History, in: Dodd &amp;  Faraone 2003, 3–24). Bremmer’s attempt to range the gods into the categories central/ orderly versus marginal/disorderly (the latter including Poseidon, Demeter, Dionysos,  Hermes, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestos) suffers from this very drawback and time and  again appears to be intrinsically contradictory. This appears nowhere better than in  his treatment of the gods’ procession on the Sophilos vase, where he declares the gods  who go by cart as gods central to “the orderly centre.” This is, however, flatly contra- dicted by the fact that the ‘disorderly’ Poseidon, Ares, and Aphrodite, too, go by cart.  For this reason Sineux 2006, 48, argues that these gods, too, contribute to consolidate  the social order. For a truly brilliant and highly revealing, though inevitably far more  complex, interpretation of the whole composition with full account of the pictorial  tradition and artistic rules (disregarded by B.), I refer to C. Isler-Kerényi, Dionysos  im Götterzug bei Sophilos und Kleitias, Antike Kunst 40 (1997) 67–81. For a radical  rebuttal of the new central-marginal classification see: I. Polinskaya, Lack of Boundar- ies, Absence of Oppositions: The City-Countryside Continuum of a Greek Pantheon,  in: R.M. Rosen &amp; I. Sluiter (edd.), City, Countryside, and the Spatial  Organization  of Value in Classical Antiquity (Leiden 2006) 61–92. Gods may be ‘marginal’ in  some contexts, while being central in others. This is pre-eminently true for Deme- ter, a central goddess in Sicilian cities, but no less for the ‘marginal’ god Poseidon:  J. Mylonopoulos, Heiligtümer und Kulte des Poseidon auf der Peloponnes (Suppl.  Kernos 13, Liège 2003) is one ongoing testimony that “eine Verbindung Poseidons mit  dem Chaos (J.N. Bremmer) als unhaltbar gelten darf ” (p. 437). Cf. also G. Pironti’s  review of the Italian translation of B.’s book in Kernos 19 (2006) 460 ff., with critical  remarks concerning both initiation and marginal/central. In sum then, to take an  expression by Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger (Harmondsworth 1970 = London  1966), 121, metaphorically: “All margins are dangerous.” </page> <page sequence="124"> 146 chapter one novelist Tom Robbins all human beings may be divided into just two  classes: those who think that everything can be divided into just two  classes, and those who don’t.”434 In the rest of this book I will continue  my demonstration that the modern paradigmatic pressure manifest in  this either-or approach has dangerously affected both the presentation  and the solution of questions. In sum, there is no unity, there are unities, creating at a different  level a new diversity, even a new type of ‘potential chaos’, that of the  multiplicity of classifications, one challenging the other and unpleas- antly disconcerting the modern observer. Is Greek polytheism kosmos  or chaos? By now my answer will not come as a surprise. One conclu- sion that has become obvious is that the different local pantheons rep- resent multiple frames of reference, contexts and perspectives, each of  them serving to help create order in an otherwise confusing diversity.  Endless ramification is just a reflex of the nature of polytheism. This has serious consequences for the description (French ‘signale- ment’) of each individual god. Demeter has been branded an  Olympian,  a chthonian, a women’s goddess, an agrarian fertility goddess, a city  goddess, a marginal goddess, a goddess of the curse, a representative of  divine justice. Now Demeter may be all this but never all at once. One  god—as identified by one name—always participates in a variety of  systems. In accordance with each system the god will show a different  face. Sometimes literally: “Our Demeter is black” say the Arcadians,  who worship a chthonian black Demeter who is the spouse of Posei- don. They cannot read—or listen to—the Homeric Hymn to Demeter,  the Olympian goddess who has a daughter by Zeus, without adjusting  both the goddess’s colour and her family relationship to this more  radiant milieu. 434 As quoted by J.Z. Smith, Trading Places, in: M. Meyer &amp; P. Mirecki (edd.),  Ancient Magic and Ritual Power (Leiden etc. 1995) 13. Cf. T.L. Scheffer, The Ideology  of Binary Opposition.

Barrett, The Rebirth of Anthropological Theory (Toronto- London 1984) 150, writes on the opposition between his own ‘anthropological’ picture  and that of Lévi-Strauss: “That picture will not resemble the neat and tidy systems of  opposition characteristic of Lévi Straussian structuralism. Instead the emphasis will be  on a world of ‘cluttered contradictions’, themselves at times messy, loosely integrated,  ambiguously located, and devoid of ultimate rational design. If this view makes the  philosophical hair of French rationalism stand on end and drives logicians zany, the  only solace to be offered is that it moves us closer to the actual character of life itself ”  (my italics). To move closer to actual life itself is precisely one of the objectives of the  present book.  </page> <page sequence="125">  many gods: complications of polytheism 147 A local god can possess a very complete palette of different functions,  may boast an all-round versatile nature, while the same god—but now  I must correct myself: the god with the same name when viewed as  a participant in the national pantheon—may be restricted to a more  specialized individual domain, characterized by specific qualities and  properties. Many great (as well as minor) gods are invoked for a great  variety of wishes and needs. This is, first, because in cult their (alleged)  specific domain is far less strictly maintained than myth may suggest,  secondly, because functional specialism is not the only ‘signifier’ or  ‘definer’ of a god, who is at least as much defined by his topological/ spatial or political position in village or polis, and, last but not least,  because different believers, even if belonging to one community, may  have a very particular personal relationship with and very different  conceptions of one and the same god. All this should make us beware of making generalizing, dogmatic  and monolithic pronouncements not only with respect to one god,  but also regarding a polytheistic pantheon. Fortunately this insight  has been steadily gaining ground during the latter two decades. Ear- lier in this chapter I have lauded John Mikalson and Madeleine Jost.  Throughout this book we will encounter different recent approaches  to the multifariousness of sometimes incongruous yet not mutually  exclusive patterns of thought in one culture. For Roman religion I  would single out Denis Feeney, who argues that any attempt to make  absolute classifications in ancient polytheism proceeds as if a society does have an immanent collective system of  cognition underpinning its religion; yet such an approach does not do  justice to the competitive variety of knowledge systems in any society,  and ends up confusing the patterns constructed by the outsider with the  actual thought of the participants435 One of these systems—not the least important—is the symbolic gram- mar of meaning as brilliantly reconstructed or constructed—everyone  will make his choice of expression here—by the École de Paris. But  as we have seen there are more, many more than I could show in the  available space. 435 Feeney 1998, 140. He follows here Bloch 1989, 106–136; 152–165, in his criti- cism of traditional cultural anthropology. We will come back to his ideas in other  chapters, most particularly in Chapter VI. See for the moment the multidisciplinary  literature on ‘finite provinces of meaning’ above (n. 226). </page> <page sequence="126"> 148 chapter one This means neither that one category makes havoc of the others or  more generally of divine structures, nor that the different registers are  completely isolated systems. One may inform others, as I hope to show  in the fourth chapter. We should not underrate the enormous impact  of the one element that connects them all: the name. It is only due to  this lowest common denominator that one can say “our Demeter is  not the same as theirs.” As long as we (and the Greeks) think only in  one register, we may find a relatively orderly and neat little kosmos.  As soon as we try to cross the borders between different registers, the  threat of inconsistency, confusion, and conflict looms large. My sug- gestion is to follow the Greeks in not doing that, or if you must— for instance when you suffer from the regrettable ambition to write a  textbook—consistently to avoid generalizing statements (which would,  as I well realize, make it a particularly unreadable textbook, unani- mously advised against for use by undergraduates). If you have just  heard that the Hagios Georgios from right here is not the same as the  one in Cappadocia, you are not supposed to ask: and how about the  dragon? Did your local Georgios kill the beast or didn’t he? By doing  so you would wilfully break the dividing lines and mix up categories,  thus creating chaos. It is also breaking the rules of the game. So do not  ask an ancient Greek how the Apollo Aguieus at his doorstep—very  much Apollo, to be sure, but a legless one—could have recovered the  cattle that the Herm in his garden—very much Hermes, but an arm- less one—had stolen, as it is told in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes.  Because then you are mixing up different registers which makes you  the one who is creating chaos, not your Greeks. As for the Greeks: they share the common human tendency to pre- vent multiple registers from clashing. They may do so by a virtuoso  winking process, well-known from (socio-)psychological reactions to  cognitive dissonance or by means of other culturally ingrained strate- gies that control perception. Long before the word narratology even  existed, every reader (listener) was unconsciously aware that you must  not give free rein to everything you know while reading or listening  to a story. The narrator focalizes, the reader should adapt, it is part of  the game. While one aspect is dominant, others lose their relevance  and become part of the background noise. It is all a matter of focus, of  perception, of marked or unmarked positions. Evoking an undesired  aspect at the wrong moment spoils the story and renders the message a  mess: chaos. The good reader or perceiver applies the correct category  </page> <page sequence="127">  many gods: complications of polytheism 149 while closing off the undesired one. It is this principle that will be of  great help throughout this book and most of all in our final chapter. If, thus, we may now grant Burkert that a potential chaos is always  lurking in the intercosmic space between different classifications, we  should first realize that this is a risk that Greeks share with any other  culture, as Mary Douglas taught us. What is order? A satisfactory con- sistent system of classifications. What is chaos? Lack of this. What  is the overlapping and clashing of different classifications and coping  with it? Culture. Hence, secondly, the really interesting issue is not that  there is a potential chaos, but how different cultures coped with it. Greeks (that is: some Greeks) pushed frontiers in their quest for  consistency, coherence, unity, rationality, order. The Greeks never lost  an awareness of living in a dissonant, pluralistic, diverse reality. One  specific feature of Greek culture, as opposed to our modern culture, is  that it displays an unmatched capacity to unashamedly juxtapose the  two, tolerating glaring contradictions and flashing alternations. It is this  deeply dissonant yet unifying principle that this book will be about, as  we will continue now to demonstrate in our second  chapter. </page> </plain_text>
