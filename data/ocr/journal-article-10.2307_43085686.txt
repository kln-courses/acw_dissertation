This is good . . . What will be the results of this concern? Some of our best scientific minds will be trying to identify learnings and techniques appropriate for school children. Some community leaders will ask for more and better science; they will strongly advocate ways in which this can be achieved. Industry will be looking for and proposing ways in which it can help. The elementary schools can gain much by listening and evaluating. Teachers, however, have an important responsibility at this time to oppose unsound proposals which are too often bandied about regarding children and learning. All ideas must be considered in terms of the pupils involved. Serious thought must be given to what can and should be done through elementary science. Certainly, factual information is important as part of the meaning concepts to which factual data contribute. But at least equally important are other outcomes of good science experience. In the articles on winter science in this issue, some of these potential out- comes can be identified. The material for this issue was prepared by Helen Warrin of the Newark, New Jersey, Public Schools. Jack Frost IS OUR WINTER ARTIST. A picture similar to this one was displayed in a first- grade classroom. The accom- panying caption, Is This True?, was sufficient to stimulate a group readiness for a problem-centered science experience. "But we sing about Jack Frost." "I have pictures of Jack Frost in a book at home." "He doesn't look like a real person." "My Daddy read me a story about Jack Frost in a book." "He must be true or we couldn't sing or read about him, could we?" Here was just a touch of reasonable doubt planted in the minds of a group of children. These youngsters were about to take another small step from the child- hood world of make-believe explanations for phenomena toward the adult world of understandings of cause and effect. There were questions, discussion, pictures, and stories. These helped answer some questions and raised others. The children observed a demonstration in which frost was produced. Ice and salt were mixed in a coffee can and frost ap- peared on the outside of the can. One day when the windows of the classroom were coated with frost, the teacher scraped off the frost. The children took turns watching this window. The frost gradually reappeared, but no "Jack Frost" was visible. The class visited the school kitchen. They helped defrost the refrigerator. They used thermometers to find the temperatures of ice cubes and ice water. Gradually, each child in his own way and at his own level came to understand that frost had something to do with freezing and with water. Jack Frost was not banished forever. More doubts now existed, varying with each child. Each had gained a little more knowledge. With more experiences such as these, this question and others like it will cease to exist. Its answer will have become a part of each child. This kind of lesson might be worked into the science program from time to time by purposeful design. As children mature from grade level to grade level, vari- ous anthropomorphic explanations of natural phenomena will be replaced by scien- tific ones.</page></plain_text>
