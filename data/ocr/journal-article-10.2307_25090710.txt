<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC CABINET They killed the Tlaxcalans. They slaughtered their daughters and wept only once. When they were satiated with the scent of Mazapan after their sundry affairs in the harem? this is when they wept. Pulled out the robe of their ancestors from Extremadura and wept aloud, as their banquets resumed in the gardens. I was left behind, in the palace. In the military dance hall. I called to them once. I wrote out the name of my gods in cuneiform, in the pink negative language that I own from my mother, I scratched out my own contract for transformation. And yet, they issued the order against me. It was simple and tawdry. It was as usual. My skin was in their shape now. This was enough. My skull resembled theirs, except my face was bowed and fell into my chest, in grayness. My arm resembled a loaf of Spanish bread, my last breast was held up for exhibition in the Friar's hallway. And my right hip gashed with a capital letter. My legs folded in an odd fashion. I could not speak. Unrecognizable with my hands, with my letters and the slit below my belly. A rag poured out of my bowels. How they tried to clean me, I don't know. A rag spilled out of my back, how they tried to translate my motion, who can say. The witnesses? The bartenders? Ask Motolinia, ask Sahagiin, ask my masters lurking in these quadrants. I have their clothes in my box. You can call them and they will ask for trousers. You can test the case if you wish. Only one arm holds me now. I can't tell whose it is. It must be mine. Recognize the strings that shoot from the ulna. I can tell by the tattoo of a Guacamaya parrot. Sperm and seashells, yellow lines across my cheeks. These are yours. 620</page></plain_text>
