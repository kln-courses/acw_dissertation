<plain_text><page sequence="1">Myths by the Cluster Heinz Hofmann (ed.), Antike Mythen in der europiiischen Tradition, ser. Attempto Studi- um Generale (Tiibingen: Attempto Verlag, 1999), 303 pp. Ours is the time of edited volumes, collections of varied pieces by groups of writers who may or may not represent a solidarity of interest. Up to and including the nineteenth century, scholarly research in the humanities was offered in the form of monographs and academy publications, each author speaking for himself (scholarship was then a male monopoly) and for himself only, without imbedding his accomplish- ment in an anthology of piecemeal offerings by friends and colleagues. That is how, it was felt, the advancement of science was most fruitfully and most vigorously achieved. The colleagues were expected to respond to the monographs with reviews or like specimens of their own. Each voice could be heard clearly and trenchantly, unob- scured by the din of other voices mingling in. The great classics of the history of scholarship and criticism are univocal contributions, and they are remembered by the names of their authors. There were also journal articles, but the journals were few, and did not solicit the major energies of those dominant in the field.' The old tradition persists in our century, and continues to yield the volumes that have marked the continuity and the progress of our discipline. The innovatory work of Eduard Fraenkel and Ronald Syme and Giorgio Pasquali and Jacqueline de Romilly is magisterially encompassed in volumes that bear their names and no others. Just like the great novelists and critics and historians of the past hundred years, they claim our attention because they stand by themselves and allow us to focus on their precious individuality. But, for a variety of reasons-the explosive increase in the numbers of the professoriate, the steadily proliferating convocation of academic conferences, and the publish-or-perish requirement now traumatizing most institutions of higher edu- cation-the twentieth century, and especially its second half, has been marked by a new form of publication, one for which, strangely, there is as yet no English name ('miscellany' is hardly the word wanted), and which, in honor of the language of the book to be reviewed, I would like to call the Sammelband. These appear as frequently now as monographs, perhaps more frequently, especially in the countries that nurture conferences and symposia, but also at the initiative of single, often younger scholars I am grateful to Tony Long and Wolfgang Haase for helping me to correct infelicities and errors, and to the latter also for enriching the bibliographical notes. 1. Academy series, in the nineteenth century, usually favored monograph-length contribu- tions.</page><page sequence="2">Review Articles 67 who perceive that a particular topic is best explored by the collaborative effort of roughly a dozen colleagues and friends. In the US, these volumes are often designed to publicize the stance of an ideological thiasos. Then there are also the Festschriften (it seems as if the new format has attracted its natural German appellation) and the memorial volumes, in which the unison of the topics is replaced by the singleness of the honorand. But they are not nearly as numerous as the one-topic publications; even so there has been some feeling that this style of honoring birthdays and deaths can be overdone. As for the journals, their number has spun out of control, but since, with some exceptions, their fascicles do not aspire to a close relationship between the indi- vidual pieces, they may be left out of account in this discussion. Sammelblinde, with their array of limited discourses jostling one another, are ex- posed to a number of handicaps. The variety of styles and approaches creates an initial difficulty for the consumer. The length allowed to each contribution makes a thorough coverage of the subject less than probable. The best that can be expected is a prelimi- nary exploration that might, some day, lead to something more extended and search- ing. And in fact many writers use the collection as an opportunity to embark on a preliminary sketch that will be improved and incorporated in a subsequent mono- graph. The hope is, of course, that the joint effect of the several contributions, with its multiple weight of interpretive approaches, will make for that larger impact intended by the editor of the volume: a substantial advance in the field of research chosen. But that is rarely the case, as indeed it is not always the case in monographs. But unlike monographs, Sammelbidnde run the risk of not coalescing in the manner desired, and this is true both of protocols of conferences and of organized collections of papers supposedly bearing on a circumscribed topic. Rare is the editorial hand that can com- pel the contributors to merge their individual talents into a harmonious aggregate. As a result, specific essays may excite the interest of readers who happen to be working in that particular area, and indeed there have been such papers that have had a lasting influence on their branch of study. But tracking and finding such papers, their pres- ence hidden within the thicket of their companions, is not an easy task, even with the generous help of L'annie philologique. Generally, at the rate at which the Sammelbdinde have been appearing, and given the inclination of academics to accept invitations to contribute something at relatively short notice, the chance of the birth of a really successful volume, unified in its scope and generating a substantial impulse to scholar- ship, remains small. And one may speculate that in many cases the time spent on preparing an entry for a Sammelband, with all the back and forth of the logistics in- volved, might have been more profitably used by the writer to complete the larger project that is the ultimate objective of the research. A separate issue is the Sammelband addressed to a lay readership, put together by a number of usually senior scholars with the specific purpose of acquainting a larger public with the current status of a scholarly field and its subdivisions. Here the em- phasis is not on novelty or advance but on dissemination and accessibility. Such con- tributions can of course also be made in the form of monographs, but the broad scope of the undertaking often renders it preferable that a number of scholars work together to achieve the pedagogical objective. Such a volume is Antike Mythen in der europaii- schen Tradition, originally a series of lectures given in summer of 1998 to a wider audience under the heading of the Tiibingen Studium Generale. The editor, Heinz Hof- mann, states in the preface that there had been no intention of having the lectures printed, but at the urging of a publisher who attended the sessions the speakers</page><page sequence="3">68 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Summer 2000 changed their minds and agreed to the publication, in spite of their feeling that the topics had already had sufficient coverage elsewhere. Seven of the ten contributors are associated with Tiibingen University. All of them are seasoned and highly regarded scholars with a number of monographs to their credit. The instinct that prompted them to present the lectures can only be applauded; the decision to give way to the publisher and bring them out in a Sammelband is open to some question. The title of the volume includes the word 'Mythen'. German intellectual history endows the concepts of Der Mythos und Das Mythische with a halo that is lacking in other traditions. The prominent authors who talked about myth as a fundamental given in human experience, from H61derlin and Schelling to Wagner and Cassirer, came out of the specifically German headwaters of romanticism. As a result there is a pervasive tendency to assign to myth a role that transcends the limits of what a more restrained analysis might permit.2 The contributors to the volume are aware of the difference between a myth, however that commodity may be defined, and the literary or artistic representations through which it is variably intuited. In these papers, the emphasis is throughout on the concrete texts and images that inspired the later adap- tations or recreations, and in many cases, especially in the case of Orpheus, on the diversity of the ancient versions allowing multiple strands of the tradition. Hence 'Antike Mythen' in the title is somewhat misleading; it is not the elusive myths that fired the imagination and led to the reworkings of our artistic capital, but the fixed realia of texts and, secondarily, art objects which yielded the necessary purchase. The title might well have been Klassische Mythentexte (und -bilder) in der europdischen Tradi- tion. The contributors understand this, and the papers succeed in tracing the palpable and circumscribed monuments generating the legacy with which they are concerned. But there is little interest in what the refinements of comparative theory and the thinking about translation have introduced into the issue of transmission, by distin- guishing between reception, filiation, adaptation, transposition, construction, imitation (Robert Lowell's term), valorization, and yet other modes.3 Moreover, Keats' pessimis- 2. Note especially Schelling's theory, in his Philosophy of Art, that myth, or 'the divine', Das Gittliche, is historically prior to the rise of consciousness, and the source of all art. Accord- ingly, the philosophy of myth continues to be a notable German specialty; among recent examples, see especially the essays by Hans Blumenberg on 'Wirklichkeitsbegriff und Wirkungspotential des Mythos' and Manfred Fuhrmann on 'Mythos als Wiederholung in der griechischen Trag6die und im Drama des 20. Jahrhunderts' in Fuhrmann, ed., Terror und Spiel: Probleme der Mythenrezeption, Poetik und Hermeneutik 4 (Miinchen 1971, repr. ibid. 1983) 11-66 and 121-143, respectively (Fuhrmann's article was reprinted in Id., Brechun- gen: Wirkungsgeschichtliche Studien zur antik-europiaischen Bildungstradition [Stuttgart, 1982], 171-198 with notes on 240-245, and in English as "Mythos as a Recurrent Theme in Greek Tragedy and Twentieth Century Drama," in R.E.

'Tradition' suggests an impersonal process, a transmission without the special engagement on the part of the transmitters (and their public) that informs the nature of the changes. One wonders whether even a general audience might not have been capable of responding with interest to some attention to the epistemology of transmission.5 That the original listeners were not totally devoid of cultural sophistication can be gathered by the authors' decision what to pass over and what to select. Hofmann, in his paper on Orpheus, for instance, merely mentions Rilke but devotes a paragraph to Milhaud. It may be asked, there- fore, why some of the authors insert extended plot summaries of well-known texts into their arguments. Further, one might have expected some consideration of the special status of Greek 'myth' which has formed a stumbling block for those, like Levi- Strauss, who have advanced general principles for the analysis of myth.6 Without a proper recognition of that special status, including the provocations, the skandalon, of its anthropomorphic polytheism, one might well ask why the Tradition has lent itself to the infinite but clearly observable variety of its progeny. There is a further point on which greater clarity might have been expected in the essays, and that is the problem of the 'source'.7 Can it be said of any of the ancient texts or pictorial representations that it is the unambiguous model from which the transmission must be derived? That in some cases the principal version of the model 4. See Martin Aske, Keats and Hellenism (Cambridge 1985) 46-47. 5.

But most of the papers exhibit a tendency to focus on a particular work or constellation of works as if that was the specific source underlying the later developments.9 Recent discussion of the difficulty of locating a 'beginning' might have recommended a greater degree of caution in identifying the sources;1a it might have been wiser to regard the presumed sources as already being part of the evolution to be traced, particularly in view of the blurriness of the contours of 'myth'. One or two of the authors are alive to the problem and strike capital for their discourse from it. This suggests that even given the setting in which the lectures were delivered, further emphasis on this theoretical isssue would not have been counterindicative. As is usual with reviews of Sammelbdnde, it will not be easy to do full justice to each of the individual papers, varied as they are, in the space allotted. But the points of my introductory remarks demand the provision of some, however foreshortened, epit- omes of their contents. By way of introduction, Walter Burkert ('Antiker Mythos-Begriff und Funktion,' pp. 11-26) presents the latest of his elegant, concise articles designed to abjure the possibility of defining myth, including a brief history of the discussion of the topic, from Heyne to Levi-Strauss, and from Bultmann to Nilsson.11 In this, possibly his loosest and at the same time most discriminating summary of his position, Burkert qualifies his earlier view that myths are 'applied tales', and distinguishes, and sets up rough beginning dates for, a number of categories, which are not exclusive of one another. What matters, as he has said elsewhere, is reception and modification, not creation. He emphasizes that especially the charter myths (Malinowski's term for myths authenticating an institution) are subject to ideologies, usually conservative. 'We have come to know Greek myths not as witnesses of a romantic primeval state of the soul, but sustained and quickened by conflicts, claims of domination, aggression and depres- sion, violence and calls to order'. Burkert's analysis is shot through with insights into the political and social dimensions of the documents that carry the myths, and with references to modern studies examining these dimensions. Of the three principal contemporary perspectives on myth-relating it to ritual (especially initiation ceremo- 8. See Carl Robert, Bild und Lied.

Among earlier discussions of the topic see Burkert's remarks in Poser, ed., Philosophie und Mythos (n. 6 above) 16-39, and Id., 'Mythos und Mythologie', in Erika Wischer, ed., Propy- lden Geschichte der Literatur: Literatur und Gesellschaft der westlichen Welt, vol. 1. Die Welt der Antike, 1200 v.Chr. - 600 n.Chr. (Berlin 1981; repr. Frankfurt a.M. and Berlin 1988) 11-12. Burkert's thinking differs from that of John Gould, 'Myth, Memory, and the Chorus: "Trag- ic Rationality"', in Buxton, ed., From Myth to Reason? (n. 6 above) 107-116, in that he re- serves a legitimate place for family myth, while Gould views the village or city as the smallest unit laying claim to the corporate ownership of a myth. Dowden does well to emphasize Martin P. Nilsson's old insight that Greek mythology is the Greek reformulation of the story of the Mycenean world and its centers of power.</page><page sequence="6">Review Articles 71 nies), psychoanalysis, and structuralist-semiotic analysis (now yielding to poststruc- turalism)12 -he clearly sympathizes with the first.13 The essay is a valuable summary of his present position by our leading expositor of Greek religion and myth. What is in question is its relevance to the majority of the papers that follow. Or, to put it more appropriately, it is a pity that the majority of the contributors have little to say that connects with the vistas opened up in the introduction. The papers that follow will, with one exception, have been extremely pleasant to listen to. Five are clear and highly informative surveys of how a particular text or figure came to be transmitted and transmuted in the course of the subsequent centu- ries. The coverage embraces a number of developments. Two of the essays, Richard Kannicht on Pandora and Hofmann on Orpheus, are graced with a wealth of interest- ing and well produced illustrations. In four other papers, Karl-Heinz Stanzel limits his purview to the working of the Odyssey in the writings of three modern German au- thors; Lutz Kaippel devotes considerable space to a discussion of the Oresteia and then immediately switches to Mourning Becomes Electra and its relationship to the Aeschyl- ean play; Helmut G. Walther tracks Wagner's progressive thinking about myth, i.e., his own version of myth, with some consideration of how the Theban tragedies fig- ured in the growth of his conception of The Ring; and Renate Schlesier canvasses 12. Burkert, perhaps justifiably, does not mention the Frankfurter Schule and its inconclusive and inconsistently formulated relation of myth to the instrumentalist reasoning of the en- lightenment self. See especially Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adomrno, Dialektik der Aufkldrung (first published Amsterdam 1947), including 'Exkurs' 1, pp. 61-99: 'Odysseus oder Mythos und Aufldirung', in Rolf Tiedemann, ed., Theodor Adorno: Gesammelte Schriften, 3rd. ed., vol. 3 (Frankfurt 1996) (also in Alfred Schmidt and Gunzelin Schmid-Ndrr, eds., Max Horkheimer: Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 5: 'Dialektik der Aufkldrung' und Schriften 1914- 1950 [Frankfurt a.M. 1987] 67-103; English as Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. John Cumming [New York 1972], various reprints, most recently in the series Verso Classics [London and New York 1997]). Adorno's discussion, like Walter Benjamin's Ursprung des deutschen Trauer- spiels (Berlin 1928; 2nd ed. Frankfurt 1982, ed. Rolf Tiedemann; English as: The origin of German tragic drama, trans. John Osborne, with an introduction by George Steiner [London and New York 1998]), has the merit of recognizing that myth is separate from and precedes epic and tragedy. Along with this, however, note also the repeated assertion, especially in Horkheimer's Eclipse of Reason (New York 1947; 2nd ed., New York 1974; German as 'Zur Kritik der instrumentellen Vernunft' in Horkheimer, Zur Kritik der instrumentellen Vernunft. Aus den Vortriigen und Aufzeichnungen seit Kriegsende, ed. Alfred Schmidt [Frankfurt a.M. 1967; repr. ibid. 1985] 11-174, also in Idem, Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 6. 'Zur Kritik der instrumentellen Vernunft' und 'Notizen 1949-1969', ed. Alfred Schmidt [Frankfurt a.M. 1991] 19-186), that myth remains an undercurrent and a potential subverter of reason. 13. For an excellent recent introduction to modern theories of myth, see Richard Buxton, Imagi- nary Greece: The contexts of mythology (Cambridge 1994). Buxton deliberately underplays the ritual dimension, though he does not go as far as Calame, who is skeptical about the outlines of the category of ritual, and indeed has questions about the usefulness of the idea of mythology: Claude Calame, 'Illusions de la mythologie', Nouveaux actes s~miotiques (Uni- versit6 de Limoges) 12 (1990) 5-35. For the ritual theory, see now Robert A. Segal, ed., The Myth and Ritual Theory: An Anthology (Oxford 1998). Of all modern theories of myth, but especially the ritual theory, it must be said that the attempt to recapture how the ancients looked at their myths is not exempt from a form of constructive utopianism, sometimes with a touch of circular reasoning. For a striking if learned example, see Christiane Sourvi- nou-Inwood, Reading Greek Culture (Oxford 1991) 3-23 and 192-284.</page><page sequence="7">72 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Summer 2000 Freud's career, beginning with his boyhood, for the varying uses to which Oedipus was put in the course of it. (Interestingly enough there is not a single paper primarily dedicated to the afterlife of a Greek divinity, a topic that admittedly would have given rise to some difficulty, but would also have presented an occasion for a novel look at transformation.) All nine papers plainly answer to the express purpose of informing a cultured but non-specialist audience about the fascinating vagaries of the afterlife of Greek texts and artworks. Few of them show an interest in the social and political conditions determining the formation of the ancient myths and of the texts and images through which they have come to be known,14 or in the theoretical positions outlined by Burkert.is The exception is Maria Moog-Griinewald; her piece makes no conces- sions to the audience before her; the entangled style of presentation seems better suited for inclusion in an avant-garde journal given over to the critical analysis of modern literature. In her hands the ancient texts become mere pegs on which to hang a theoretically informed explication of two modern works, Christoph Ransmayr's Die letzte Welt (1988) and Roberto Calasso's Le nozze di Cadmo e Armonia (1988), in the spirit of a poetological invalidation of myth. The body of theory invoked, however, is not specific to the issue of myth, but that of Genette and Derrida and the nouvelle critique. It should be clear from the inventory of the contents that inclusion in the volume was directed not by the shaping discretion of the editor, but by his choice of the speakers, who were left free to exercise their own talents. This is a common procedure in the putting together of Sammenblnde, and was made quite inevitable by the peculiar circumstances prompting the publication of the volume. Further, the qualms expressed by the speakers when publication was proposed to them, namely that the plethora of publications on the afterlife of Greek myths might make their own contributions re- dundant, cannot be entirely discounted, in spite of the editor's overly modest claim that the lectures were not principally intended to present new findings. Some of the papers are indeed surveys of what can relatively conveniently be found elsewhere; others are more ambitious in their attempt to say something new. Now for some comments on the individual papers. Heinz Hofmann's sampling of the uses of the Odyssey from archaic vases and Pindar to French comic strips is the most detailed and most comprehensive ('Odysseus: Von Homer bis zu James Joyce,' pp. 27-67). He asks which episodes of the poem were prominent in ancient works after Homer, and settles on the Cyclops, Nausicaa, and the Sirens. He also selects for special treatment Tiberius' Sperlonga sculptures of the Scylla and Polyphemus. The wealth of examples from antiquity, late antiquity, the middle ages, the three centuries after 1500, and the modemrn period is impressive, and the selection is judicious and often original. 14.

The excellent illustrations contribute to the clearsightedness of his canvass. Both literature and the visual arts and, especially for the modern period which is the meat and the more probing part of the paper, music are brought into play.16 Throughout Hofmann demonstrates his cultured familiarity with the arts in all periods and many traditions. He often connects a particular work with its historical background. His extended comments on Joyce are sensible and thoughtful. He nicely ends his inventory with remarks about attempts to retrace the wanderings of Odysseus, particularly the adven- ture of two brothers who let their sailboat drift with the prevailing winds and identi- fied Odysseus' geography with wherever their landfalls took them, in defiance of the warning of Eratosthenes that the stations of Odysseus' travels could be discovered only by one who found the cobbler who had stitched the bags of Aeolus. It is a pity that the rapid format of Hofmann's account does not allow him to branch out into some intriguing questions arising from his narrative. At one point, after describing Arnold B5cklin's 'Odysseus and Kalypso', Hofmann speaks of 'symbols of a situation, a crisis, that can be true of any human being, and which, despite all covertness, B6ck- lin also intended to be a statement about himself.' Here, in passing, we touch on the capacity of the adaptation of a myth to open up the hidden nature or a temporary but crucial experience of the adapter, a subject that might well have borne fruit if time had not been pressing. Nor was there time to ask how prominent or powerful Bdcklin's dependence on Greek myth was in the sum total of his work. Stanzel's handling of the reception of the Odyssey ('Zeitgenassische Adaptionen der Odyssee bei Inge Merkel, Michael Kahlmeier und Botho Strau1S,' pp. 69-89) is diametrically opposed to that of Hofmann. He selects four modern works, three novels and a drama, and describes their contents and their manipulation of Homer's model. Two novels, by Luigi Malerba and Inge Merkel, are given relatively short shrift. The emphasis is on the works of Michael Kdhlmeier, whose tetralogy of a modernized Odyssey-the suitors drive Citroens and Hondas, and Phemius plays the banjo-is still moving toward completion; and on the five-act dramatization of the second half of the poem by Botho Strauss (Ithaka; subtitled Schauspiel nach den Heimkehr-Gesangen der Odyssee), with acts entitled 'Arrival', 'The M~nage of the Suitors', 'The Scar', 'The Bow of Odysseus and the Reunion', and finally 'The Contract'. Stanzel's method is almost exclusively descriptive, pointing to the many changes rung upon the Homeric inci- dents and characters, and to the dovetailing of the ancient and the modern. Kdhlmei- er's modernization is, Stanzel decides, the more radical, though he retains the ancient gods. They turn into observers of Odysseus' decision-making: Odysseus decides against being made immortal, because immortality would immortalize his guilt. Stanzel de- cides with some assurance which of Kohlmeier's effects are more successful than others; there is no attempt to check off Kdhlmeier's procedure against Joyce's domi- nant recreation of the Odysseus tale. Stanzel concludes lamely that 'the modern refrac- tion imposes upon the familiar material the stamp of the alien', and that the world of the Odyssey is turned into a mere foil, as if these judgments were tantamount to a 16. Hofmann does not advert to the controversial view that many, if not most, of the archaic visual representations are not indebted to Homer but to rival traditions. For a recent state- ment, see, Anthony Snodgrass, Homer and the Artists: Text and Picture in Early Greek Art (Cambridge 1998).</page><page sequence="9">74 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Summer 2000 disparagement of K$hlmeier's achievement.-Strauss, who uses a narrative chorus of three women called 'Knee', 'Clavicle' and 'Wrist', sticks closely to the scenario of the Odyssey but politicizes and brutalizes the action: Penelope has become fat, the killing of the suitors is a horrendous bloodbath ('murder' is a common term), and only Zeus with his thunderbolt can bring Odysseus to his senses. The reviews called Strauss xenophobic and militaristic; Stanzel defends him against the charges, and decides that of the four works discussed Strauss' treatment is closer to the tenor of the Odyssey and more relevant to modern contingencies. Stanzel offers little analysis; his comparative remarks rarely transcend the kind of commentary found in a good German Theaterpro- gramm. One would, for instance, wish to have the author's thoughts on why he thinks the play demands a chorus, 'fragmentary women' as Stanzel calls them, carrying those articular names, an echo of Bruno Snell's dissection of the Homeric body. But those of his listeners not acquainted with the works in question will have been thankful for the information received. Ernst A. Schmidt's 'Achill' (pp. 91-125), a heavily footnoted paper, starts on a note of polemics. He quarrels principally with Katherine King and Joachim Latacz, and prefers to take his stand on the side of Uvo Halscher.17 To Latacz he ascribes a 'gloomy cultural pessimism and radical critique of modernism'. In asserting the claim of an authentic and integral transmission of what Homer has to offer, he comes down heavily on the doubleness of the hero of the Iliad, who combines within himself the natures of noble prince and berserker. The latter term he derives from the book by Jonathan Shay, who has researched the behavior and the sufferings of American Viet- nam veterans after the war, and compared them explicitly (and, perhaps, simplistical- ly) to what he finds in the Iliad.s18 Schmidt roams freely and learnedly through the tradition. In an effective technique of arguing for the cohesiveness of the tradition of Achilles' internal conflict he dispenses with chronology and cites the way stations, from Dictys and Dares to Christa Wolf and from Pindar and Catullus to Holderlin and Goethe, as if they were contemporaries. Except for the more detailed remarks on Goethe and his sources, with Dr. Faustus and Helen making an unexpected appear- ance, the tallying of authors and works is designed to impress with the vitality of the myth rather than with an exploration of the individual stages. Extended excerpts take the place of in depth inquiry. Ultimately Shay, supported by Hilscher who is quoted at length, becomes the centerpiece of Schmidt's argument, though he allows that Shay's disregard of Iliad 24 puts a dent into the soundness of the identification of Achilles as a berserker. One regretfully concludes that, in spite of the intriguing mixture of learned Quellenforschung, the sophisticated arrangement of the material, and bold reinterpreta- tion, Schmidt's paper does not succeed in making a compelling case for an Achilles who is both in his origins and in his survival a hero conflicted in his very nature. But, paradoxically, in highlighting the constancy of the tradition channelling the character of Achilles, Schmidt comes closer than his colleagues to intuiting the configuration of a myth hidden behind the filter of its divergently embodying texts. 17.

In the absence of other signifi- cant classical versions of the tale he reminds us of Sophocles' satyr play Pandora or the Hammer-Blowers (of which only a handful of fragments has come down) and of the vases whose paintings may take their inspiration from that play. Here Pandora is not, as in Hesiod, taken as something given to an unwilling recipient, but as a creative force, a Mother Earth who sends up her fruits, with a chorus of slaves hammering the ground, perhaps to provide the clay for her sculptural embodiment.19 In this version there is no jar, though that Hesiodic key feature is taken up again in the antiquarian reports of later antiquity, in which Sophocles' version is quite forgotten. The church fathers identify Pandora with Eve; Origen says that the opening of the jar equals the fall from grace. The transformation of the jar into a box is spelled out along the lines of the Panofskys' famous discussion.20 Kannicht traces the Pandora motif through a number of European writers, with special though uncritical emphasis on Goethe's festival poem Pandora, which dramatizes the reconciliation of Prometheus and Epimetheus and the opening of Pandora's vessel to disseminate ideas, concepts, and images; and on Frank Wedekind's Lulu, originally intended to be named Die Biichse der Pandora, in which Goethe's Earth figure turns into an incarnation of erotic power, destined in the end to be undone by Jack the Ripper. It is against this background of varied successor versions that Kannicht finally returns to Hesiod, offering a plea con- cerning the interdependence of the jar of evils and the nature of hope, itself an evil, in fact, with Nietzsche,21 the most evil of evils, but without whose awareness of the other evils their hurtfulness would not be appreciated as such. Kannicht buttresses his read- ing with the citation of an extended passage from Hesiod's Works and Days, in both German and Greek, which one assumes was not lavished upon the original listening audience. It does not, however, become evident what gains the postponement of the paragraphs on Hesiod derives from the anticipation of its Wirkungsgeschichte. But the survey, with its handsome and well chosen illustrations, is polished and instructive. Hofmann's 'Orpheus' (pp. 153-198), the longest paper in the volume, starts with various ancient versions, both literary and pictorial, of the tale of Orpheus and Eury- dice, but then quickly turns to the history of Orpheus alone through late antiquity, in his congruent roles as poet-singer, prophet, miracle man, quasi-philosopher and founder of a religious cult, latterly reconfirmed by the finding of the Derveni papyrus.22 There 19.

The material for the Middle Ages and for the early modern era is particularly rich, and here Eurydice and the snake reappear, with various sea changes transforming their functions and their symbolic potential. Eurydice, for in- stance, is likened to Eve; elsewhere, both Orpheus and Eurydice are made to stand for reason, enlightenment, and love. Orpheus' philosophical and religious power reemerges with Ficino and the early Renaissance, and once he enters into the operatic repertory23 and late Renaissance painting his pastoral standing among the animals, a motif first found in the ancient Roman poets, is securely established. Hofmann's rapid survey of this rich and circuitous history is learned and assured. Only certain questions that might be asked-why does Orpheus wear a Phrygian cap? Why do the pictorial ver- sions give him a lyre now of four, then of six, or seven, or eleven cords? Why does a late fifteenth-century Orpheus look into a mirror?-are left incompletely answered; the amount of material cited simply leaves no time for elaborate investigations of issues that may in fact have no satisfying answers. In the modern period Orpheus crops up as a central figure in the scholarly work on Greek religion from Friedrich Creuzer to Fritz Graf, and in the poets from Goethe to Ingeborg Bachmann (here the inventory, with its rare references to non-German-language writings, is too cursory to be helpful). Hofmann further, in a more leisurely way, provides an interesting account of some of the important modern treatments of Orpheus and Eurydice in opera, drama and film, all of them ringing marked changes on the story, often by relocating the characters into a lower class or demi-monde milieu. Before he ends with Stravinsky's ballet 'Orpheus', Hofmann changes his pace and devotes more than five pages to an interpetration of Arno Schmidt's Caliban iiber Setebos, a satiric romp which at one level is a devastating travesty of the ancient legend, with characters whose names are sup- posed to remind us of the old prototypes. The prominence accorded to the exceptional Schmidt almost suggests that Hofmann felt that after listening to the plethora of re- spectable reportage the audience deserved the thrill of a piece of maverick freakish- ness. But one wonders whether the amount of space and meditation bestowed on this shocker compensates for the speed with which Hofmann has chosen to cover the large quantity of fascinating material he has at his disposal. Thomas Alexander Szlezik's 'Odipus nach Sophokles' (pp. 199-220) is probably the most original essay in the volume, gratifyingly so since he was entrusted with an inordinately familiar topic hardly promising a fresh approach. Like Schmidt he skews much of the chronological sequence. As a result, he achieves a high degree of compar- ative criticism, aligning the various pieces of the tradition side by side to bring out their special properties. A drama by Diirrenmatt, medieval revisions of the Oedipus story, the 1585 premiere performance in Vicenza, Stravinsky's oratorio with a Latin version by Cocteau, and Orff's setting of Hl61derlin's translation of Sophocles are made to serve for an introduction. He then turns to Aristotle's view that Oedipus Rex was the model play, though in Szleziik's view it did not really satisfy Aristotle's own definition Pythagorean Tradition (Oxford 1995) (reviewed by Jonathan Barnes in this journal [IJCT] 4 [1997/98] 460-462). 23. On Orpheus in opera since the late Renaissance period cf. most recently Jeffrey L.

He speculates that the notion of Oedipus as a model predates Aristotle, and that it was Sophocles who with his Oedipus in Colonus and its account of what man is capable of made Oedipus the paragon of theater history. Next he takes up other ancient versions of the story from Homer to Euripides, arguing that none of them (with the partial exception of a lost play by Aeschylus) feature Sopho- cles' two extreme moments, Oedipus' self-blinding prompted by a sense of responsi- bility for his deeds, and the confident meeting of his death. Szlezak treats the two plays as if they were parts of an organic whole, with Oedipus as a kind of aspiring everyman who actively submits to the divine oracle, with parricide and incest playing a subservient role. Before going through the list of the later handlings of the legend, he details some of the new elements introduced by them: Oedipus and Jocasta in love; a reduction of the power of oracles and the will of the gods; the erasure of Oedipus' isolation and of the autonomy of his self-destruction; and the scrapping of his ambivalence as both guilt-ridden and a bringer of blessings. The list that follows, exhibiting further adjust- ments of the details and the introduction of additional elements, reaches from Cor- neille to Gide and beyond. In contrast with these shifts Szlezak finds, in reverting to the source, that Sophocles in turn produces an effect of horror without the emphasis on the incest motif usually ascribed to the play, a motif which is more emphatically foregrounded in other versions (including a variant legend of the birth of Moses). Horror is further increased in the Senecan tradition, at the expense of the theme of Oedipus as the intelligent searcher. This same diminution of Oedipus' active intelli- gence is fully explored in Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Oedipus und die Sphinx, which incorporates Oedipus' parricide, has the Sphinx expire at the very sight of Oedipus without posing the riddle, and shows Jocasta and Creon worshipping Oedipus as a god, before sliding back into a virtual translation of Sophocles's work. Andrd Gide's Oedipe, Szlezik argues, tries to amend this neutralization of the seeker and thinker in a number of ways, though the bourgeois tone of the play subverts the very idea of heroism. By means of a limerick about the learning machine, the computer replacing the seeker, SzlezBik takes us briefly to Cocteau's La machine infernale, before arriving at the obligatory coda on Freud, who is given surprisingly but refreshingly short shrift. He expresses some doubts about Freud's take on the Oedipus story, but acknowledges that Freud's interpretation has reinforced the authority of the myth in our world. (And here, it might be said, the use of the term 'myth' has, on the strength of the extreme variability of the tradition, lost all concreteness and moved close to the alternate sense of mirage.) Szlezik's final comments are on Henry Bauchau's novel Oedipe sur la route, which has for its subject the twenty years of travel between the two Sophoclean plays, in the course of which all characters are reconciled with themselves. 'What may be the latest Oedipus has become a symbol of the soul continuously reading itself, against the background of a vastly transformed psychoanalysis, in which sexuality no longer has an exclusive key function'. Freud and his epigones thus become responsible for this paper, brilliant in its major moves of singling out the vagaries of the principal themes, ending not with a bang but an unavoidable whimper. Kippel's 'Der Fluch im Haus des Atreus: von Aischylos zu Eugene O'Neill' (pp. 221-241) moves on a much narrower front than the other papers. After presenting lengthy summaries of the contents of Agamemnon (and the rest of the Oresteia) and of Mourning Becomes Electra, which are somewhat rigidly laid side by side for their analo- gies, Kippel asks in what sense a coverage of the latter fits into the present book. The</page><page sequence="13">78 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Summer 2000 answer: American culture is unavoidably European, an affirmation that was undoubt- edly true in O'Neill's day. He distinguishes between modern reworkings of ancient dramas that retain the old names, and a play like O'Neill's which totally Americanizes the characters. The former are appreciated against the original versions, with the dif- ferences clearly marked; in O'Neill's case what matters are the correspondences, and an acquaintance with the model becomes even more imperative than where the an- cient names are retained, a proposition which is perhaps open to some doubt. Klippel rightly points out that in his own records O'Neill saw a correspondence between his management of psychology and the ancient workings of fate. Kippel insists on the importance of the whole chain of the curse, from the crime of Atreus on, for the understanding of O'Neill's play, as an equivalent to the persistent Puritan obsession with sin and penance. Without further evidence he includes Artemis' blocking of the winds at Aulis as part of the chain. At the same time, in Mourning the sequential prehistory of the Electra story is replaced by a greater focus on the personal relations, which are developed along two lines: the Freudian: Lavinia's Electra complex, Orin's Oedipus complex, Ezra signalling thanatos, Christine entailing eros; and Puritan repres- sion, which explodes into sexual aggression. As O'Neill's trilogy unrolls, Klippel ob- serves, the deviations from the Oresteia and the Electra story become ever greater, Orin killing himself and Lavinia relapsing into asexuality. Still, the combination of the Freudian and the Puritan factors is made more plausible by our recognition of its role as a facsimile of the curse on the house of Atreus. O'Neill demonstrates the endurance of the ancient tale, but also 're-archaizes ' it by abandoning the humane ending of the Oresteia and allowing the curse to linger on. To sum up, Kippel offers some interesting observations, but seeing that he does not have to run through a great deal of material we might have expected more depth. His overlong summaries of the plays' contents deprive him of the opportunity to raise such pertinent questions as how the two tragic works differ in stage technique and in their diction. A more sustained look into O'Neill's records might have been productive. Moog-Griinewald, the rhetorical and conceptual loner of the collection, signals her otherness with her title: 'Uber die isthetische und poetologische Inanspruchnahme antiker Mythen bei Roberto Calasso, Le nozze di Cadmo e Armonia, und Christoph Ransmayr, Die letzte Welt' (pp. 243-260). Once again the emphasis is on a small body of modern work, but the works chosen for analysis seem to differ greatly in their linkage to the past. Upon first acquaintance, Calasso's work appears to be an imaginative collage of the near-total store of Greek history and mythology, while Ransmayr's brilliant experimental novel takes its cue from an entirely unmythical stock, Ovid's exile in Tomi. And yet the choice makes a certain sense, in as much as Die letzte Welt contains many echoes of the Metamorphoses (as well as of the exile poems), the poetic equivalent of Apollonius' Library which is the chief source of Calasso. As Moog- Griinewald deals with these complex structures, she stays true to Burkert's approxi- mation of myth to a tale that joins the experience of past, present, and future. In her hands the myths become 'pre-texts' in which poetry 'zu sich selber kommt'. She propos- es to deliver a comparative (and contrastive) analysis of the two works, rather than, as is done in the rest of the volume, to trace the modern back to the ancient. But in fact her 'comparison' devolves into a sequential tabulation, with Ransmayr getting the lion's share of spirited analysis, while Calasso is made to appeal to us in the form of long quotations from his work. She delves into Die letzte Welt as a slow, fitful, frag- mentary discovery of bits and pieces of the Metamorphoses, and as an account of the</page><page sequence="14">Review Articles 79 inhabitants of Trachila (i.e., Tomi) who themselves function as reflectors of Ovid's tales. However, her muster of the novel's particular moments and figures and events and motifs deliberately makes of it a poetological nullification of myth. As Ransmayr says: 'The tale of the myth is finished'; it is 'now without significance and at best a game for crazies'. Moog-Griinewald recognizes in the novel a revival of early romanti- cism as well as Derridaesque references to the power of the written signifier (the structuralism of Levi-Strauss is left out of the picture). By way of contrast she reminds us of Handke's 'The invention of reality no longer stood in need of recording'. This, she says, cannot be true in the light of the fragmentary signs remaining after the snails have been vitriolized away by the servant Pythagoras, one of Ransmayr's stunning scenes. Perhaps Moog-Griinewald wants to see too much, a whole landscape of mod- ern and postmodern theory, in the wilderness of the novel. In Calasso, Moog-Griinewald says, stories are not completed but told again and again. Each triumphant beginning dissolves into further variants, very much in the spirit of high modernism, but without its anguish. The mythical network conceals an ethical as well as aesthetic order which is maintained via dislocation and deception. The constant process of recombinations and reformations is based on the building blocks of treachery, rape, and metamorphosis. Whereas for Ransmayr myth is an escapist delusion, a subjectivizing of poetic reality which consequently is no longer commonly experienceable, in Calasso myth is, as with the Romantics, the echo of an a priori cosmos. Calasso has faith in the creative power of myth, 'whose late trace', according to Moog-Grtinewald, 'he can still perceive in the thickness of the novel'. The wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia had marked a last meeting of gods and humans, before aging and ruin set in. But Cadmus had brought the alphabet, which now allows humans to apprehend the gods in their minds. Thus myth, though the token of a loss, remains alive. Calasso's smooth meandering, more accessible and less daring than Ransmayr's tenacious experiment, provides less of a challenge to Moog-Griinewald's interpretive verve. Altogether, in spite of its alien status within the volume, and in spite of the difficulty of its prose, the ambition of her essay can only be admired. With Walther's 'Richard Wagner und der (antike) Mythos' (pp. 261-280), we re- turn to the paradigm format of a public lecture. But the parentheses in the title alert us to the news that here also the modern is for the most part privileged over the ancient. The myth of the essay is that of The Ring and of the various earlier versions through which Wagner struggled toward it, with some pointers to the inspiration Wagner received from the Greeks, especially Greek tragedy in which, he felt, the conflict be- tween history and myth was controlled by the authority of the state. The Theban cycle, especially the story of Oedipus, Walther asserts, furnished Wagner's standard: an Oedipus who betrays his attunement to nature for a position in society. The state is the villain imposing a false morality, including the condemnation of incest. According to Wagner, the great revolution of which he regarded himself an active proponent re- quired 'a drama which in the form of myth should chronicle and at the same time redefine the meaning of the course of human history from its beginning to the (present) ending'. For this a combination, though not a fusion, of the three sister arts dance, music and poetry, as on the Greek stage, was obligatory. And the myth of the Nibelun- gen is, under these auspices, identical with the ancient myth. Walther, however, takes it upon himself to show what, granted this conception, goes wrong in The Ring. He also takes issue with rival interpretations of the work, and with the licensed produc- tions in Bayreuth. 'For Wagner, myth is structured as catastrophe, so that the mythic</page><page sequence="15">80 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Summer 2000 catastrophe of the end of history and the factually historical revolution of the present coincide'. Wagner's thinking is utopian, but The Ring itself does not dramatize the expected postrevolutionary freedom, except through the language of the orchestra (this intriguing remark, deriving from Livi-Strauss,24 is not explained). Some of the polemic is difficult to follow, in part because of the daunting risks taken in many of Wagner's own observations, but also because Walther, who clearly knows his materi- al, does not obtain the necessary distance from the stations of Wagner's itinerary.25 Of Nietzsche, he merely remarks that he is a typical contemporary, 'typischer Zeitgenosse', whatever that may mean. In sum, Walther's paper, more interested in the uses of various Greek materials and in an appraisal of the revolutionary aesthetics of the Ring, sheds little persuasive light on precisely how Greek myth worked its magic upon the cycle.26 In the final paper, Renate Schlesier's 'Auf den Spuren von Freud's Odipus' (pp. 281-300), the author asks: 'How does Freud deal with the figure of Oedipus, and is this treatment perhaps paradigmatic of Freud's general management of mythology?'. The latter question is not answered. The paper is largely a straightforward account of the stages of Freud's acquaintance with and use of Oedipus and Sophocles: his reading of the play at his gymnasium, and his preoccupation with the figure of Oedipus in his correspondence (the comments on his gymnasium education are disagreeably dismiss- ive, as are some subsequent strictures on the nature of classical philology today, which might have been truer twenty years ago); his famous letter to Fliess, 24 years after leaving school, in which he announced the results of his long self-analysis, containing in nuce the concept of the Oedipus complex; and the notion of the 'romance of filia- tion', the Abkunftsroman, according to which parents are perceived as step-parents, Freud's misprision that takes the sting out of incest. Here Oedipus becomes a signal representative, as does Moses because of his Egyptian descent (with consequences for Freud's own disavowal of his Jewishness). Freud's linkage of his findings with the Oedipus tale, Schlesier says, perpetuates what his teachers had taught him, the univer- 24. Mythologiques IV (Paris 1971) 584-5. Walther refers to Carl Dahlhaus, 'Musik als strukturale Analyse des Mythos: Claude Ldvi-Strauss und "Der Ring des Nibelungen"', in Dieter Borch- meyer, ed., Wege des Mythos in der Moderne: Richard Wagner, Der Ring des Nibelungen (Miinchen 1987) 64-74. 25. We may note that at one point, in Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft (published 1849), Wagner says that 'Der Mensch irrte von da an, wo er die Ursache der Wirkungen der Natur auflerhalb der Natur selbst setzte, der sinnlichen Erscheinung einen unsinnlichen, ndmlich als menschlich willkiirlich vorgestellten Grund unterschob, ..." (Richard Wagner, Gesammelte Schriften und Dichtungen, 4. Aufl., 3 [Leipzig 1907] 43) ('man erred from the time when he set the cause of Nature's workings outside the bounds of Nature's self, and for the physical phenomena subsumed a super-physical, anthropomorphic, and arbitrary cause .. .': Richard Wagner's Prose Works, trans. William Ashton Ellis, vol. 1 INew York 1892] 70). This comes close to rejecting my- thology, though often Wagner tends to identify Nature (especially what he calls Volksnatur, one of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries' fuzzier concepts) with myth, thus seemingly anticipating one of the less attractive ideas found in some of the writings of the Frankfurt School. Walther again does not alert us to Wagner's twofold use of the term 'myth', to denote both specific dramatic texts and the poetic power of the folk. 26. It is perhaps of interest that Walther (out of deference to the reading habits of his audience, or because Der Ring is a uniquely German masterpiece?) cites only German-language items in his notes and in his bibliography.</page><page sequence="16">Review Articles 81 sal validity of classical Greek poetry. For a while he gets away from the Sophoclean drama because its details are too complex to tally with the simplicity of the libidinal drive. But along the way, Schlesier has some provocative remarks about the sentence structure in the letter to Fliess, with its 'peripeties', serving as a simulacrum of the effect of Sophocles' play on the listeners. The play itself, rather than the figure of Oedipus, once again becomes a model in some of Freud's later works, not for its Aristotelian evocation of pity and fear, but on the grounds that the plot, with its artfully delayed revelation, matches the validity of the psychoanalytic method. Freud criticises Jocasta's skepticism about dreams, 'as if she were', in Schlesier's words, 'no tragic figure but a colleague from another wing of the psychotherapeutic establish- ment'. Schlesier's narrative of Freud's involvement with Oedipus and Sophocles is based on solid sources and presents a good overview. Perhaps it is her assumptions about what her audience can and cannot absorb that prompt her not to introduce some of the rich perspectives on myth assembled in her own Sammelband entitled Faszination des Mythos.27 What, then, can be said about this assembly of papers in the light of the warnings sounded above? The large majority of the papers are of a high standard of scholarship, as was to be expected from this galaxy of distinguished academics. They are interest- ing, attractive, and informed, and it is easy to understand that a publisher would take an active interest in them. But on the double score of a deep penetration of the material and of a sense of the implications of the term 'myth', on the one hand, and of forming a collection of essays that answers to a uniform and interlocking theme, on the other, the bulk of the volume is less satisfying. Yet it should not be forgotten that the circum- stances of publication were unusual, depriving both the contributors and the editor of a considerable share of the customary control over their project. Taking into account the modemn blossoming of the Sammelband, and weighing the merits of this volume against other examples of the genre, it may confidently be asserted that it has much to offer and will find a ready readership.
