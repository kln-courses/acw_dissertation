Now everybody.... - from Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow It' s the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine... - from R.E.M/s ' The End of the World" The 1960s and Post/postmodernity WHILE of upheaval fiction, THE ground on 1960S a vast IN zero array AMERICA was of marked fronts, (AND certainly by ELSEWHERE) the aesthetic for contemporary SAW and philosophical CATACLYSMIC writers upheaval on a vast array of fronts, certainly for contemporary writers of fiction, ground zero was marked by the aesthetic and philosophical revolutions associated with the advent of postructuralism, and the subsequent emergence of postmodernism. In 1967, for instance, author John Barth glibly pronounced the demise of the novel in "The Literature of Exhaustion." In that same tumultuous year, critic Jacques Derrida dramatically traced the "flight of the signifier" in his monumental "Structure, Sign and Play" (later published in Writing and Difference). And not long after, Roland Barthes presided over the very "death of the author." Needless to say, these commentaries did not produce postmodernism, but rather established an epicenter whose lines of force continue to resonate across American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1 1</page><page sequence="2">2 the contemporary cultural experience. Twenty-five years later we are still postmodern, or perhaps post/postmodern, for lack of a better name. And although contemporary literature shares many of the tropes noted by its literary predecessors, we are clearly experiencing a second wave of postmodern confusion- and possibility. American fiction, in particular, is a site of this emergent post-apocalyptic sensibility. It is dangerous, of course, particularly when dealing with an era largely defined by its resistance to facile generalities and truths, to seek to define the direction of contemporary literature. Deconstruction has taught that all categories are mutable. Nonetheless, for purposes of discussion, it seems useful to discuss certain literary trends in the evolution of contemporary fiction. That these trends are more a matter of perception than academic knowledge is a given. Like notions of force and field, they are in many ways projections, a form of cognitive- mapping cast across the divergent postmodern landscape. It is tempting, when charting a literary excursion such as this one, to define the literary shifts by focusing upon authors. Indeed, until recently English departments and graduate studies were often constructed upon authorial lines. Most of us are closet gossips, and the desire to know " Who's Who" is predominant. But we would be wise to resist this impulse, not only because the theories of postmodern discourse maintain that such hierarchies are always canonical and exclusive, but because in this new landscape topics seem more urgent than do personalities. Moreover, this later postmodern period has been marked by an increased appearance of women and minority authors. To define their work through the personal and biographical- which would be through race and gender- is ultimately reductive. Suffice to say then that contemporary literature, since 1984, for our purposes here, is marked by both a return of the big-hitters of early postmodernis- Pynchon, DeLillo, Didion, Morrison- and a plethora of new, young, and often marginalized authors. Significantly, these newer authors occupy as prominent a place in the literary terrain as do their elders (although how prominent a place any writer can command in our new largely visual world order remains an unsettling question). Carlton Smith currently holds a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship, at the University of California, Irvine. He received his doctorate from the University of California, Riverside, in the Spring of 1994. Recent publications include: "Arctic Revelations: William Vollmann's The Rifles and the Frozen Landscape of the Self/7 in Contemporary Review of Literature (Fall 1994), and "Thomas McGuane" in Postmodern Fiction. American Studies International , April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="3">3 Written in the aftermath of Vietnam, in the wake of boom prosperity and then economic decline, the contemporary novel is often the site- in its text and very often in the specifics of its plot-line- where the post-traumatic stress is evidenced. Central to many contemporary novels is the sense that something terrible- if indeed undefined- has happened and the text is the record of its aftermath. What this disaster is- global, personal, or cultural- can be read as a defining novelistic trope. Within these post-apocalyptic fictions this discussion will suggest that the following topics can be read as recent themes or newly renovated genres in the post-postmodern novel. In cyberspace, in the deconstructed western, in the wreckage and reconstruction of history, and in the de-centered domestic spaces, these new "trends" can be discerned. The Place of Domesticity From its inception, much of American fiction focused upon the possibility of domestic bliss and further balanced this notion against the demon-infested wilderness that howled outside the home-site. The captivity narrative was structured by the captive's (ultimately fulfilled) desire to return to the homestead, despite its terrors and travails. Later, the colonial morality novel celebrated what we today have come to call "family values." If both urbanity and the frontier menaced this family tranquility, the familial hearth resisted diminution. Indeed, as Ann Douglas has noted in her Feminization of American Culture (19 77), it was not until the late nineteenth century that this literary domestic space was undermined by a burgeoning trend of "re-masculinized" fiction. (It is an interesting aside to note that "rugged individualism"- as expressed in industrial capitalism and manifest destiny- was philosophically incompatible with domestic peace. Money and empire making required a renewed and untrammeled masculinity that was unchecked by domestic considerations.) Yet, in spite of imperialism, greed, and even the development of Reaganomics, the domestic novel prevails. Explorations of the familial have enjoyed a continuous popularity American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1 Deborah Paes de Barros received her doctorate from the University of California, Riverside, where she has also taught. Most recently she is associated with Palomar College, where she is a faculty member. Her publications include contributions to the Columbia History of the American Novel , to the Cambridge Literary History , and to the Prentice Hall American Literary Anthology.</page><page sequence="4">4 in this century, and the theme has found particular meaning within the postmodern landscape. Contemporary fiction interrogates the place of domesticity and suggests that this supposed stable haven is at once idiosyncratic and haunted. It is the dissonant site where warped nostalgia is confused with disconnected and disconcerting affections. The frequently strange fictions of Mona Simpson, Jane Anne Phillips, Marilyn Robinson, Bobbie Ann Mason, Ellen Gilchrist, Tobias Wolff, David Leavitt, E. Annie Proulx, Denise Chavez, and Tess Gallagher (to name but a few off of a prodigious list) all address the theme of home and family. Similarly, John Edgar Wideman, David Foster Wallace, and Kathy Acker explore the nature of attachment as it is frustrated by urban angst. But their fictions are troubled and contradictory, for in the matrix of postmodernism the domestic space shifts and transforms. The family is reconfigured. Single mothers, disassociated siblings, and alcoholic relatives abound. Home is no longer a fixed concept; characters live in their cars, in trailers, apartments, and in the temporary shelters offered in this new world order. There is little stability. War-shocked veterans, amnesiac adolescents, abused children, and disenfranchised women wander the landscape. But the shift in family order is characterized as much by a corresponding alteration in sensibility, an alteration that is not altogether negative. For this apparent disorder, this collapse in family values, often provides a glimpse into some previously concealed possibility. If false hierarchies, mute hypocrisies, and evident disloyalties are revealed, the discovery is often accompanied by a simultaneous and new understanding. In the disorder of the post-apocalyptic family, hierarchy is decentered and demystified. The result is often a renewed and bizarre capacity for wonder. Such wonder is not easily achieved. It is not surprising that these fictions are marked by the presence of ironic nostalgia, loss, and even regret. The mathematics of pain and growth are explored in Mona Simpson's Anywhere But Here (1987), and in its sequel, The Lost Father (1992). The first volume of this first- person narrative concerns the adolescence of the protagonist, Ann, her separation from her Midwestern relatives, the absence of her father, and her rocky life with her nearly psychotic mother, Adele. Together, like millions of mother and daughter teams before them, they travel to California hoping to discover stardom (or, minimally, a rich father). As in nearly all such tales, the streets do not glimmer with gold, and the few tenable dreams that find some fulfillment appear banal. But in some strange way, while nearly vitriolic in places, Anywhere But Here is ultimately about the eerie quality of maternal love. In its deconstruction of affection, the novel reasserts the daughter's bond with the mother. Similarly, The Lost Father which appears to be a quest novel, seems finally to re-establish the bond between Ann and her mother (as well as between Ann and her newer "family" of women friends). Ann's "lost" father is ultimately an unimportant and pathetic figure, and in the undermining of patriarchy the protagonist is set free. The absence of a father does not matter, learns Ann. Rather, it is the dependence upon such patriarchal structures that erodes a woman's life. American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXJII, No. 1</page><page sequence="5">5 The role of patriarchy is further explored in Tobias Wolff' s autobiographical account This Boy's Life (1989). Once again, the simple mystique of the father is unravelled, and replaced with a myriad of complex relations which unite the son with the maternal figure. Indeed, any father figures that are offered prove to be suspicious. The narrator's biological father is depicted as a liar who can never be depended upon. The various step-fathers provided are nearly all predisposed toward violence and even abuse. Despite their masculine rhetoric, their authority is based upon nothing substantial. Toby's mother is a far better shot with a rifle than her masculine competitors. Significantly, for both Wolff and Simpson, this child-mother relationship comes to real fruition only through language, rather than through domestic interaction. It is in the act of writing, which requires both the act of remembering as well as forgetting, that the family is reformulated. Language is then, the true arena of domestication. Jane Anne Phillips's fiction shares many of the same qualities. In Machine Dreams (1984), as well as in her more recent Shelter (1994), the exigencies of family life are considered. While the family unit of Machine Dreams was hazarded by Vietnam, Shelter's protagonists are unhinged by a less definable horror. Something is terribly wrong, but a diagnosis seems impossible. Like many of her contemporaries, Phillips frees the site of the family from anything resembling sentimentality and nostalgia. She understands youth as something far removed from innocence, and the families she examines are quite unable to offer even minimal emotional shelter. Familial affection, rather than offering protection, makes one vulnerable. In this post/postmodern world, love emerges as something far more complicating than it is comforting. As the adolescent protagonists of Phillips's Shelter- supposedly kept secure and away from the world within the perimeter of Girl Scout camp- scramble through a world haunted by potential nuclear disaster, child molesters, and alcoholic parents who have lost their own ways, it becomes evident that in postmodernity there are no safe places. But this truth echoes with a kind of strange comfort, for in this deconstruction of childhood's shelter there is absolution for us all. There is no need to measure up, to compare our own families and to find ourselves lacking. Shelter is only found in Norman Rockwell portraits. We are all strange lost creatures, taking some small comfort in the mutual quality of our peculiarities. This same reconfiguration of the familiar marks the fiction of David Leavitt. The Lost Language of Cranes (1986) deals with the creation of a homo-erotic space with the domestic sphere, while A Place I've Never Been (1990) is a collection that details our unabated longing for a love that must always go unfulfilled. While The Lost Language of Cranes is overtly concerned with the byzantine twists of family life, A Place concerns the ways in which we attempt to reconstruct another- more ideal- family through our friends. The characters in Leavitt's stories care for one another, clean each other's apartments and cook for each other. But haunted by AIDS and the presence of death, Leavitt7 s work suggests that there is no way that our desire for love and safety can find resolution. We offer each other only "limp consolation," maintains Leavitt, and finally our feeble domiciles merely illustrate our own emotional inadequacies. American Studies International , April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="6">6 Liberation from familial guilt marks the Latina fictions of Sandra Cisneros and Denise Chavez. In their collections, Cisneros's Woman Hollering Creek (1991), and Chavez The Last of the Menu Girls (1986), an alternate sensibility is discovered, a sensibility that at once focuses on the domestic space and simultaneously transforms it. In Cisneros's "Woman Hollering Creek," aided by the counter- reality of soap operas, the fictional Cleofilas finally rides in a pick-up truck back across the border to a new life, an existence wherein patriarchy is displaced by a more matriarchal model. In casting off the traditional roles of wife and mother, Cleofilas is free to recast the meaning of family. In other stories in the collection, the very mythologies of masculinity are re-examined. The "Marlborough Man," we are told in a story of the same title, is "really gay, girlfriend." "Bread" subsequently suggests that romantic love may be wonderful for a man but is "rat poison" for the woman. Each narrative in Cisneros's work subverts the idea of masculine authority and patriarchal romance. The Last of the Menu Girls asserts a similar theme. Chavez's idiosyncratic narrator, Rocio, defines an alternative domicile. In "The Closet" she invents a house that holds a "blue room" and a "grey room," spaces where women can lead alternative lives, counter lives that at once unravel and redefine the domestic space. Free from the rules of patriarchy, Rocio lives a free and imaginative life within the realms of the fictional closet. Here, she watches fantastic animals and speaks in a new voice to whatever she encounters. This new vocabulary challenges previous definitions of domesticity. In the title story, "Last of the Menu Girls," Rocio is forced to take a job in a hospital because it is the proper role for a young woman student. Inexplicably, she is constantly associated with a lurid portrait of Florence Nightingale. But Rocio resists this identification, finally escaping from the male hospital director to walk free in the arroyo. She is literally outside of paternalistic space. David Foster Wallace's works, in The Broom of the System (1987) and in The Girl With Curious Hair (1990), trace the manner in which the urban home space is displaced by television and the exigencies of urban life. Everything becomes simulation. In "Little Expressionless Animals," a story from the collection Curious Hair, the characters become the contestants on "Jeopardy." Julie Smith becomes the undefeated champion (lasting on the show for three fictional years), while her mother becomes its producer. Julie's house is merely an uninhabited high-tech T.V. show set. Still another tale, "My Appearance," details the concerns of a woman who believes that she will appear on David Letterman in order to discuss her life and potential career, while "The Girl With Curious Hair" is based on the experiences of Sick Puppy, a quasi-businessman/pseudo-punk. The story largely concerns Sick Puppy's dialogue with Mr. Big and Wonderful, and with his girlfriend Gimlet who styles her hair to approximate a penis. The characters speak largely in what appears to be ad copy. Once again, the family unit is displaced and disassociated. It is a celluloid image, rather than a real entity, broadcast across the lunar eruptions of the urban space. For many of these writers, Vietnam is the unspeakable horror. Typically unmentioned, it is the occasion of erratic behavior. The war provides the American Studies International , April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="7">7 background for the byzantine twists of many of these plots. Bobbie Ann Mason's In Country (1988) concerns an emotionally disturbed brother who is a Vietnam vet. The military provides the escape for Wolff's narrating alter-ego, while Phillips's novel, Machine Dreams (1984), concerns the erosion of the familial by the unceasing violence. Simpson's fictional family is in some way isolated by their inability to participate in the war; the narrator's aunt comments that everyone talks about them because of their son's medical discharge. After all, the neighbor's sons were all called. Indeed, it is perhaps the war which is the catalyst in redefining "family values," and the nearly lost site of the domestic. For the Vietnam War inexorably linked family prosperity with a necessary and costly violence. Swimming pools were only possible in the post World War II economy because of the growth of the military; summer camp was possible because of the burgeoning aerospace industry. Underneath the sheltering roofs of middle-class homes, the bombs were planted and above it all resonated the pitch of the air- raid siren. West of West Just as contemporary authors revise the domestic space, current fiction also proposes to radically alter the terrain of the West. Like the category of domestic fiction, the "western" enjoys a renewed popularity. But questions centering upon the very notion of the frontier trouble this contested space. Where is the West, and who really claims it are queries that disturb this re-constructed postmodern genre? Further, if- as critic Jane Tomkins maintains- the West is a completely masculine locale, then what constructs masculinity? Thomas McGuane, Cormack McCarthy, Rick Bass, Richard Ford, Rick DeMarinis, Ron Hanson, Jim Harrison, Allison Baker, and Pam Huston are included in the growing list of authors who challenge earlier conceptions of the American frontier. Richard Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America (1967) reaffirmed the connection between young male writers and the trope of masculinity so associated with Ernest Hemingway. But when Brautigan killed himself in a gesture which replicated Hemingway's own suicide, the problematic nature of masculinity asserted itself. The traditional western is haunted by the now too familiar problems of patriarchy and violence. Significantly, Owen Wister's classic, The Virginian (1898), is dedicated to the notions of "rugged individualism" and manifest destiny. But the postmodern world is increasingly bothered by ideas regarding imperialism and the cult of individualism. The political ramifications of conquest are both apparent and disconcerting. Yet, the themes and accoutrements of the West, and the western, persist. Masculinity, territorial destiny, and suspect celebration of individualism are explored in the postmodern western, but this exploration culminates with a critique as well as with reification. The "Virgin Land" of the frontier is found to be infertile and perhaps utterly uninhabitable, yet it is nonetheless seductive. American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="8">8 Thomas McGuane has spent his literary career contemplating the puzzle of American masculinity. His "Deadrock" novels, Nobody's Angel (1979), Something to be Desired (1984), Keep the Change (1989), and Nothing But Blue Skies (1992), provide portraits of self-conscious patriarchy. Most recently, Nothing But Blue Skies, provides a parody of manliness in the West, but also suggests that moving beyond paradigms of masculinity, even when this masculinity is self-conscious, must always be a difficult mission. McGuane's middle-aged Frank Copenhaven finds himself deserted by his wife, ignored by his daughter and disenchanted with his Montana life. The acquisition of money, territory, and women has turned out to be a fraudulent promise, for Frank's life is both foolish and empty. Rugged masculinity is revealed to be a cultural trap; family truths are mere mythologies. Frank's daughter is a better fisherman than her austere and very western grandfather. Despite their "blue sky" rhetoric, the state's cowboy patriarchy has polluted the fishing streams with their moneymaking schemes. There is no "virgin land," and if there were, the novel suggests, it would be immediately corrupted. Frank's sexual prowess replicates the sexuality of his western predecessors, yet his wife still leaves him for a "new man," a demasculinized practitioner of psycho-babble. Mistresses desert. A man, it seems, may go quietly though the frontier carrying his "big stick" (fishing pole, gun, phallus) but no one really cares. But McGuane's novel concludes with an irksome perplexity. For, as Frank discovers, the well-worn trail of patriarchy in the West may end in self- destruction but as yet no other path has been revealed. McGuane acknowledges that we construct ourselves against the "Other," that our avarice corrupts our very desires, and that the code of violence turns against us. But he finds no way out, leaving the reader with only a sense of irony and a still persistent affection for the passing fiction of the West. The problems of violence and masculinity are also central themes in Cormack McCarthy's novelistic series, "The Border Trilogy." This multiple-volume work explores the West in neo-realistic terms, echoing Faulkner's mytho-poetic language and constructing an alternative terrain. McCarthy's beautifully written fictions revisit the arid West while unflinchingly exploring the violence which is its production. In the first of the series, All the Pretty Horses (1990), a group of young heroes navigate the dangerous markers and signifiers that separate not only the Southwest and Mexican borders, but categories of "good" and "evil," and "civilization" and "savagery." McCarthy disrupts and re-inscribes these categories and contexts, demonstrating that they are but permeable boundaries in the hearts of all. The Crossing (1994) moves forward in time, and finds McCarthy examining how in the years before the World War II, the frontier space moved inexorably towards modernism and its consequences. In still dusty New Mexico, amid this final moment of the "wild West," McCarthy's young hero Billy sets out on the road and learns that the old "myths" of the West are deeply resonant with an America verged on cataclysmic violence. Beneath each of these moving re/visions circulates the stark realization that the Edenic garden promised by the expansive frontier had been but a fantasy. American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="9">9 This image is continued in the work of Harrison and DeMarinis. For them, the land is tainted by a buried violence. The towns of the West are built upon the bones of massacred Native Americans, and missile sites are buried deep "beneath the wheat" promising a final cataclysm. As DeMarinis maintains in his collection Under the Wheat (1986), all relationships are held hostage to subterranean pressures. The notion of the virgin land is mere rhetoric from its very inception; the West has been a place of violent dispossession. Rather than being the "last best place," it is rather the seat of corruption. It was the occupation of the frontier which defined the imperialistic nature of the American character. The pressure to know and to claim the "Other" is the nature of the American experience. And with this messy heritage, relationships and romance are nearly doomed. Patriarchy and "family values" and rhetoric displace the truth of the West and indeed of a frontier nation: space which is defined by power relations has no room for familial or romantic affections. Hence the series of flawed relationships which seem characteristic of new western literature. But is there an outside of these traditional western tropes? Women western writers, such as Alison Baker and Pam Huston ponder this question in their feminist western fictions. But their answers are contradictory and largely unsatisfying. Baker's title story, "How I Came West and Why I Stayed," concerns a narrator who parodies male "discovery" tales. She has come to the West in search of the mythic "cheerleaders," and ultimately disappears into the postmodern maze of the mountains. It seems that no feminine "western" space can be situated. Similarly, in her less mystical collection, Cowboys are My Weakness (1992), Huston suggests that there may not be another, re-coded West. Her protagonists essentially become men, assuming the gun, the fishing rod, the trapper's canoe paddle, and the phallus. Only in her closing story, "In My Next Life," does Huston suggest that some alternate space might exist. She and her Native American friend, Abby, consider starting a western commune for women. Nearly lovers, they contemplate some sort of existence outside of masculinity. But they cannot even guess at the architecture of such a structure. Even before they flesh out its possibility, the desire, it is denied. So remote is this possibility that the narrator can find no language with which to claim or even articulate it. After Abby's death, the protagonist ventures outside and recognizes that she is left only with silence. There is no vocabulary for a feminine evocation of the West. It may be that there is no outside to this historic space. The Fall (ing in and out) of History In The Postmodern Condition (1984), Francois Lyotard contends that our postmodern moment is characterized by "an incredulity towards meta- narratives." This sentiment- a radical distrust of master-narratives- undeniably informs many contemporary writers whose work seeks to interrogate the very idea of history. Rather than viewing history as a stable entity, many of these writers view history as yet another fiction. For these writers, no historical truths American Studies International, April 1995 ', Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="10">10 exist; rather, history is but a vexing compilation of narrative shards, disparate fragments subtended by power relations, held together by our collective and desperate desire to construct meaning and a sense of order. These writers question the very idea that a "past" exists beyond the constructive influences of text and imagination. Linda Hutcheon has called such fiction "historiographic . metafiction." While numerous postmodern writers of the 70s and 80s- such as Guy Davenport, E.L. Doctorow, Ishmael Reed, Don Delillo, and Gunter Grass, to name but a few- continue to pursue "historiographic metafiction," recently many writers clearly find the "past" and its construction(s) an ever-pertinent topic of inquiry. Not surprisingly, for American and North America writers, historical fiction involves re-visiting discovery, Native contact, empire, colonialism, and the discursive and material violence perpetrated against indigenous cultures in the settlement of the continent. History exists not as an isolated entity, but as part of the larger processes of cultural signification. Prominent among younger writers pursuing theses historiographic themes is Canadian William T. Vollmann. In particular his "Seven Dream" series of novels- to date, The Ice Shirts (1990), Father's and Crows( 1992) and The Rifles (1994)- dazzlingly explores European-indigenous contact and the often violent process of trans-cultu ration that occurred during the conquering of the Americas. Bringing together reportage, historical narrative, exegesis, confessional, poetic insight, philosophical treatise, anthropology, and technology, these books emerge as richly textured meditations on the West's desire to "write" the "Other." In these interventions, "history" remains an illusive "referent," enmeshed within discursive webs and colonial productions of meaning. In The Rifles (1994), for example, Vollmann appropriates the occasion of British explorer Sir John Franklin's nineteenth century trans-polar voyage, and his fated contact with the indigenous Inuit, to unmask the ways in which the western "Self" is often predicated on appropriating the "Other." In the process of producing his "history," Vollmann himself enters the narrative (Vollmann quite literally went to the North Pole in the process of writing this story, staying for days in an ice- shack at absolute North). In doing so, Vollmann implicates himself in the production of "history" and thereby exposes the ongoing issue of appropriation in the production of texts. Also raising provocative questions concerning Native traditions and European interventions is Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead (1991), an encyclopedic novel that attempts to counter-narrate the so-called conquering of America. Part "almanac," it reads as a virtual catalogue of oppressive encounters between Native Americans and European invaders. More importantly, perhaps, it also celebrates numerous Native traditions, myths, sacred sites, as well as Native ideas about history and "what really happened." Inspired by the actual apocalyptic future foretold in the Ghost Dance- Ghost Dancers were killed by the 7th Calvary at Wounded Knee in 1890- its chimerical plot concerns various indigenous revolutionaries who conspire to bring down the power structures currently operational in the Americas. Central among these is La Lecha, the Meztiza possessed of the ability to commune with the dead and on whose American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="11">11 shoulders falls the responsibility of preserving the ancient "almanac of the dead." For her and her cohorts, the "history" written by "whites," is but a fantasy which awaits to be overturned by the forces inherent in Native traditions. As the Ghost Dance prophesies, the moment will come when the invaders will destroy themselves, and all the dead indigenous peoples of the Americas will return to inhabit its once bountiful expanses. Recently Gerald Vizenor has become prominent for his "trickster narratives." These oppositional narratives playfully interpolate ideas of Western history within their comic play. Viewing the Native American trickster not as an anthropomorphic being, but rather a sign in narrative, Vizenor updates the oral traditions associated with trickster, producing highly imaginative stories full of "tricks," reversals, and inventions. Sadness in Saint Louis Bearheart (1978) marked Vizenor' s inaugural trickster narrative, and he has continued to employ tricksters' s tropic disruptiveness to explore Native American historical traditions in the postmodern context. Most recently, Griever, An American Monkey King in China (1990), interweaves Chinese cultural history, issues of colonial mind-control, and Native American oral traditions, in a serio-comic escapade involving a professor's travails in China. Ultimately, for Vizenor, his postmodern stories represent a way for him to simultaneously expose "Indian" as a colonial production developed in colonial America, and to resist stereotypical identifica- tions. Trickster thus is remade as a vibrant traditional force within the postmodern context. Trickster fictions are also central to the work of Louise Erdrich, who uses this configuration to explore Native American history. A prolific poet and novelist, Erdrich's work includes the tetralogy composed of Love Medicine (1984), the Beet Queen (1986), Tracks (1988) and, most recently, The Bingo Palace (1994), as well as the popular parody, Crown of Columbus (1991) which she co-authored with her husband, Michael Dorris. Each of these novels deals with history, focusing finally upon the elusiveness that inevitably defines the past. In Love Medicine seven different narrators attempt to explain the histories of three tribal families. But these histories force the reader to question the very nature of a linear history and to conclude that there are only interrelated stories- stories that are frequently undermined at a crucial moment by the presence of the trickster. The Beet Queen investigates the margins of the Chippewa nation, for it concerns the lives of non- reservation people who also live in the North Dakota region. Tracks , however, moves backward in time and traces the effect of plague, poverty, and assimilation on the Chippewa reservation between 1912 and 1914. The inheritors of this traumatized history, whose relatives related the tales of Love Medicine and Tracks, take over the story in The Bingo Palace. Ultimately Erdrich's tetralogy bears an eery similarity to Silko's Almanac, for Edrich too is concerned with tales of betrayal, corruption, and the commodification of the sacred. Spiritual ground has been displaced to erect a casino. Lottery tickets are handed out by the dead in the place of visions, and the great white buffalo heralded by Native prophesy arrives in the form of a white motor home. The medicine pipe is sold. But as Erdrich's characters ponder these American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="12">12 defections, a kind of transformation occurs. The very elusiveness of history prevents its erasure. As Lipsha dances and courts Shawnee Ray, despite the fact that he is perhaps a crazed and dispossessed disciple, history returns. His dead mother, June (central to Love Medicine) is redeemed. The stories of the Kashpaws, the Lazarres, the Lamartines, and the Nanapushes continue. The Bingo Palace closes with a revisitation of the ancient Fleur Pillager. The narrator meditates on the strange nature of history, and on Fleur's continued existence, commenting that "...left among us, Fleur's tracks, once more, it is said that she still walks/' (273) And in Fluer's presence, the nature of history and the trickster are revealed. At the close of the novel Fleur- ghost, myth or ancient crone- leaves the written histories and the "storehouses of fact," and walks into the snow pulling a ghostly toboggan of bones. These bones are history, and because they are ghost-like and mutable they can never be possessed but can only taunt, elude, and confuse those who would endeavor to hold them. The foolishness involved in the western pursuit of history is satirized in Erdrich and Dorris's Crown of Columbus (1991), wherein a Dartmouth professor and his Native American lover are drawn to a remote Caribbean island in pursuit of the "real" Columbus. The necessary failure of their mission is revealed by another shifting and ambiguous figure who offers to sell them "the real" diary and a crown that is "beyond price." As in any trickster tale, the hopes of the protagonists are confounded by the vanity and absurdity of their cause. The materiality of history resists easy commodification, and scholarly accessibility. We are pursued by postmodern laughter, as the novel offers a parody of academic debate. There are no histories, Erdrich's texts argue; there is only a series of interwoven tales whose telling and retelling will always displace the "realness" of history. Finally, Canadian writer Thomas King pursues similar themes concerning history, contemporary reservation life, and the often frustrating processes of trans-cultu ration. In Medicine River (1991) and Green Grass , Running Water (1993), "white" history indeed emerges as a monolithic obstacle- though an ultimately surmountable obstacle- to contemporary Natives inhabiting the Blackfoot reservation in Canada. In Medicine River , world class photographer Will moves through his life, encountering the past, coping with the present, all the while struggling with the travails of contemporary relationships. Lyrically written in the first-person, Medicine River develops a highly evocative representation of consciousness, which emerges as a kind of repository of "voices" from his past that have influenced him. Green Grass, Running Water, by contrast, employs a complex dialogic structure while similarly emphasizing the cacophony of voices present for Natives embroiled in border-crossing between Native and dominant cultural traditions. Like Vizenor's trickster narratives, Grass delights in linguistic subversion, inter-textual references, and the playful exploding of the stable historic signifier. Traditional history is for King thus but a single strident voice, ultimately capable of being overcome by the multiple voices resplendent in Native traditions. And, it is Native oral traditions that eventually lead one of its protagonists, a Blackfoot named Lionell, to a greater awareness of the "old ways" American Studies International, April 1995, Vol .

Fittingly, the annual Sun Dance is the site of this renewed possibility- a sacred place of transformation amid the turmoil of the postmodern world. Virtually Real- Pynchon, SF, Cyberpunk and Hyper-reality As literature has attempted to reinvent itself to somehow capture the ever- increasing perplexities of the postmodern world, Science Fiction (SF) and its various affiliates-cyberpunk, "ad vent-pop," fantasy, and "virtual fiction"- has emerged as an innovative realm where many important new writers struggle to comprehend the present and near-future. These writers- among them, Lou Shiner, Bruce Sterling, Lucias Shepard, Harold Jaffe, Richard Kadrey, Mark Leyner, and William Gibson- often blend shards from other genres, such as detective, gothic, and western, inherit, and renovate the legacy of the numerous SF writers of the 60s, 70s- like Philip K. Dick, J.G. Ballard, and Samuel Delaney. Increasingly, like their predecessors, these writers associate the present technology of cyberspace and the hyper-real with the specter of the apocalypse. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all of these writers identify Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow (1973) as the seminal text establishing SF as a literary base for the interrogation of these "serious" cultural problems. Indeed, Pynchon's immense novel seemed to assert that only SF was somehow capable of capturing the new realities of our alienating and often absurd techno-world. Part pastiche, meta-history, parody, and surreal-cartoonishness, as well as a stunning melange of informatics, techno-babble, and absurd plot- trajectories, Gravity's Rainbow amounts to a highly complex unmasking of the emergent World War II technolo- gies of destruction, and their part in creating a "new reality." This new reality, or "hyper-reality"- the by-product of war, mass culture, runaway mechanization, and our ever-mediated environments- has ultimately found expression in contemporary writers who strive to somehow construct what Larry McCaffery calls a "new realism"- a poetics somehow reflexive with the dazzling and often pernicious "present" hyper-real, and its uncertain, nearly unfathomable future. Probably the most famous inheritor of Pynchon's obsession with hyper-real has been William Gibson. Gibson's wildly popular Neuromancer (1984), which brought the term cyberpunk into mainstream vernacular, deals with a "computer cowboy" whose escapades in the near future unfold as a crystalline meditation on the perils of life along "the information highway." As a subversive loner, Gibson's recalcitrant hacker, Case, finds himself at the behest of power- configurations beyond his glimpse and control- distant pulses that exist in the mysterious recesses of a computer driven web of information known as the Net. In The Difference Engine (1991/ co-written with Bruce Sterling), Gibson explores similar themes while moving backwards chronologically to the Victorian age and the advent of the Babbage's counting machine. Here Gibson attempts to uncover the paradigmatic shift towards information systems that came in with the advent of Modernism. With his most recent novel, Virtual Light (1993), Gibson again American Studies International, April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="14">14 revisits the future-realm of the Grid, this time exploring the seductive pull of the hyper-real, and its cool hand in commodity culture. Merging detective elements with classic SF and fantasy tropes, Virtual Light poses numerous important questions regarding issues of "the self," public versus private, cyborgs, and the very nature of humankind in the information age. Like Gibson, Rudy Rucker has also been associated with the cyberpunk movement, though his fiction certainly sets out to mark its own space. For Rucker, the punkish near-future worlds of his fiction encapsulate the endpoints of present trends, and thus hauntingly serve as refractive "cautionary" visions. Integrating not only broad SF traditions- which he has called the "beat old cliches"- but also the experimental spirit of avant-gardists like William Burroughs and Raymond Federman, Rucker7 s Software and (1985) Wetware (1988) stand out as classic explorations of "virtual" worlds. In these oddly familiar future-scapes, history, language, and desire, collide with the paranoia induced by a dominant technocracy. In Software for example, an over-the-hill space traveler arrives at a mysterious space-station, but then awaits removal to another colony, where deliverance or death awaits. Similarly, in Wetware , Rucker' s hero negotiates a mysterious, "cybernetic world," where the former ontological divisions between human and machine, mind and body, have become irrevocably compromised. In mysterious and often alarming ways, both these novels ponder difficult existential questions regarding runaway technology and the status of life. Similarly obsessed with our troubling techno-culture, Mark Leyner has attracted a wide audience for his work, which idiosyncratically maps the intersections between media, electronic culture, and the ever-increasing crisis of information saturation. As such, Leyner's fiction seems like a strange cross between MTV, a CD-ROM encyclopedia, beer commercials, and the "infinite white hot dots" of random information that saturate our daily postmodern experience. While much of Leyner's shorter work has received critical acclaim- many collected in his book of stories I Smell Esther Williams (1983)- he has received popular success with his novel My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist (1990). In My Cousin, Leyner's precise prose pushes representation towards a seeming terminus, a post-realism that somehow captures the hyper-real of our mediated age. Like the fiction of William Burroughs' s, whose "viral" prose registers the pervasive influence of technology and information, Leyner's fiction resists explication in terms of plot and character. My Cousin correspondingly is a kind of literary CAT-scan of the cultural moment, in which language struggles to escape the screen-like flatness, pure information, and unrestrained data. Another contemporary writer concerned with reinventing language in ways resonant with our shifting culture is writer Harold Jaffe. Highly experimental, irreverent, minimalistic to a point approaching code, Jaffe' s fiction examines the hyper-real in an ongoing attempt to expose the political structures that have influenced the technological "advances" of postmodern culture. Most prominent in this regard are Madonna and Other Spectacles (1988) and Eros Anti-Eros (1990). In these compilations of short, potent stories, Jaffe often comically exploits the familiar images of electronic pop-culture in an effort to expose the systematic American Studies International , April 1995, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="15">15 oppression that circulates with these slick images. Indeed, for Jaffe, as with Leyner, pop-culture is the paradigm or our age, a paradigm that conceals the nearly complete commodication of reality by the array of trans-global power bases that have saturated our very consciousness. Incorporating a range of "voices"- from Madonna herself, to Reagan, punk, exec-speak, cartoons, and Castro- Jaffe's "fictions" thus join in a sharp warning that resonates across our technocratic landscape. End/Note As we approach the millennium these voices form the concert that is post/ postmodern fiction. Bemused, reactive, mock-tragic, and at once somehow transcendent, they (re)(de)construct the contemporary world. Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow concludes with an image of focused nuclear weapons falling toward the "old" metaphorical theater wherein the author assumes we are all seated. The bomb reaches "its last unmeasurable gap." Absolute destruction is at hand; there is only time to sing. What fictions are possible after this moment? It is this question that post/postmodern authors contemplate. For after all, these writers are the children of the Cold War, reared with the aid of air-raid sirens and sent under the school desks to avoid the apocalypse. They are the children of Vietnam, violence, and conspiracy theories. They have seen the failure of liberalism and the rise of the New World Order. These post-apocalyptic fictions are their stories, all our stories. There is only time to sing, "a simple and pleasant air of the period.
