<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME IMPLICATIONS OF LOCAL CONCEPTS OF SPACE IN THE DANCE, MUSIC, AND VISUAL ARTS OF ACEH By Margaret Kartomi Design in Acehnese dance, music, and visual arts is guided by four general concepts of space. The upstream-downstream concept, governed by the centuries-old tendency to travel to the forests upstream and the coastal towns downstream, is associated with Animist-Hindu-Buddhist mysticism and commercial success respectively, resulting in methods of creating arts and crafts that belong either to upstream or downstream areas or both (in the latter case, for example, in the making of the great frame drums). Traces of the cardinal directional concept of space, with a similar Animist-Hindu-Buddhist background, link the directions to dominant colours used in artists' costumes, performance arena backdrops, embroideries, paintings, and other arts and crafts. The geometric concept governs formations of dancer-musicians and musician dancers in a performance arena, as well as some traditional visual art designs and some modern paintings. Probably dating back to the pre-D?ng-son era (before c. 300 B.C.E.), this concept is expressed in various linear, circular, square, and concentric designs. Finally, the central-point-in-a-circle concept of space is believed to have its parallels in Perso-Arabic thinking and points to Aceh's links with Persian, Moghul, Turkish, and Arabic cultures over the past millennium. It governs mosque-centred town planning, some visual art designs and some formations of dancers and musicians who circle around their leader at the centre point. Parallels between the Acehnese performing and visual arts lie in their application of the principle of freedom versus form. The creative invention and free ornamentation of leading singers and dancers contrast with the melodic and textual symmetry, disciplined compactness, and cyclic redundancy of their group followers, just as the artistic creator of a visual artwork invents an original design within stylistic limits while also using some cyclically repetitive border designs. Introduction This article presents a hypothesis that the main dance formations guiding Acehnese dancer-musicians and musician-dancers, together with the colour associations of costumes and stage decorations and the making of the large frame drums, were conceived on the basis of four concepts of space. The term dancer musicians refers to artists who are primarily dancers, but also use their bodies as percussive and vocal instruments to produce body percussive music while performing body movements, in contrast to the term musician-dancers, which refers to frame drum musicians who also use their bodies as percussive and vocal instruments between bouts of frame drum playing and body movement.1 When 1 The present investigation focuses mainly on the structure and cultural meanings of dancer-musicians' and musician-dancers' typical floor plans. It does not deal with dancers whose only function is to dance to instrumental accompaniment, as in the case of the ranub lampuan dance, usually accompanied by frame drum, drum, and wind players. Nor</page><page sequence="2">2 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC either group of artists performs body percussion, they produce patterns of rhythmic sound by beating on their bodies?chests, shoulders, thighs, and hands?stamping their feet, and snapping their fingers; they also usually sing group responses to elaborately ornamented melodic-textual settings that are improvised by a pair of alternating singers (aneuk syah?, lit., "child of poetry"). There are four main Acehnese concepts of space, that is, "specific way[s] in which people from a particular culture conceive space and experience it in their daily life" (Bar-Yosef 2001:423). These are the upstream-downstream, the cardinal directional, the geometric, and the central-point-in-circle concepts. I aim to show how these concepts are expressed in selected examples of the traditional and contemporary performing and visual arts of Aceh. Links between the concepts and the artefacts are expressed, for example, in traditional relationships that many Acehnese see between the cardinal directions and the colours that they use in costumes, embroideries, paintings, and architecture. The geometric concept is likewise reflected in the formations of dances and the decorations on musical instruments and other craft objects, and includes lines, parallel lines, triangles, and circles, as well as concentric circles, squares, rectangles, and diamond shapes. Before focussing on the Acehnese concepts of space, however, I shall discuss a few comparative intercultural examples. Intercultural concepts of space As has become clear in recent ethnological studies of music and dance, various human groups adhere to their own distinctive way of looking at space, spatial relationships, and the environment. A concept of space applies deep-seated cultural ideas about the nature of space and its human organisation, ideas that may be expressed in music, dance, visual arts, architecture, and the other arts (see, for example, Bar-Yosef 2001 and Giurchescu 2003). Particular views of the spatial structure of the world across societies affect how the respective people choose a location for and design a building or cemetery, how they refer to directions when out walking or sailing, how they obtain natural materials to make objects needed in daily life, including utensils, objets d'art, and the particular visual designs and artistic ideas lying behind their creation, how they design and decorate a musical instrument, how they structure floor formations of their dances, and how they choose to structure performance spaces for their dancers and musicians. Performances, or re-performances, of a familiar artistic event, such as a ritual, dance, or competition held in a field or a building, are social expressions that include the space in which they are performed. As Stokes puts it, a dance or music performance event "evokes and organises collective memories is it intended to be a thorough structural analysis of Acehnese dance choreography and movement, a topic that awaits further detailed study by specialist dance scholars. Structural analyses of choreographies in Central Javanese court bedhaya dances may be found in Brakel-Papenhuijzen (1992:183-300), and of Malay zapin dances in Nor (1993:132-56). Analyses of Acehnese dance choreographies, formations, movements, and body percussion techniques have not yet been fully documented.</page><page sequence="3">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 3 and presents experiences of place with an intensity, power and simplicity unmatched by any other social activity" (Stokes 1994:3). Concepts of space and the resulting aesthetic ideas and practices tend to vary from society to society. For example, the "general concept of space" in Romania is described as "narrow, straight, crowded", a concept that is "followed in the ornamental design of traditional costumes, in the way graves are massed in a cemetery, in people's proxemics (a very narrow interpersonal space) when walking in small groups, dancing or watching the dance, and in the 'compact' compositional form of the local dances and dance music based on varied and/or heterogeneous linking of motifs" (Giurchescu 2003:166, n. 5). This contrasts with the dominant European space concept in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Here space is regarded as infinite, while partial autonomous spaces, framed or bordered, are seen as part of it. Framed spaces include towns, performance arenas, and picture frames that impose an orientation on the objects they contain. Thus, a dancer moves according to directions implied by the shape and proportions of the stage, which is disconnected from the outer world and constitutes a complete autonomous space in itself (ibid.). Concepts of space also differ from era to era in the one society. The traditional Romanian and other European folk concepts diversified in the twentieth century, for example, when "modernist" concepts of space were exemplified architecturally by skyscrapers followed by "postmodernist" concepts that rejected them and returned to more user-friendly, village-size units within cities. More relevant to present-day Muslim Aceh is an important space concept in traditional Perso-Arabic culture. This concept is "oriented to a central point, cosmic or local. The central point is referential for the objects around it, often arranged in concentric circles" (Bar-Yosef 2001:434). Thus, an ideal Muslim city is built around its main mosque as the central point, as in the case of Baghdad, built in the eighth century CE. by the Khalif al-Mansur, with the mosque and palace being located at its centre (ibid.). The lines of graves in a Muslim graveyard in Aceh and other parts of Indonesia are normally organised around a central point that orients the head-stones to face the direction of Mecca, that is, roughly north-west. Mosques are oriented likewise. Even belly dancers conceive of their movements in relation to a central point, their navel (ibid.). Based on cosmological Animist-Hindu-Buddhist2 ideas that have remained influential in parts of the archipelago from the early first to the early second millennium CE., remnants of the cardinal directional concept remain extant in Aceh and some other parts of Southeast Asia to this day. In Hindu Buddhist thought (first to fourteenth centuries CE.), space is arranged according to the four cosmic, cardinal directions with a fifth point in the centre (Lombard in Leigh 1989:172). "Space is highly ordered ... and its use is organized according to definite rules..." that are derived from cosmological religion and nature beliefs (Hobart 1978:5-7, referring to Bali). However, the oldest evidence of this system dates from the twenty-third century before our era, when Chinese cosmological thought and ritual saw the cardinal directions as being related to the winds, 2 By "animist" is meant veneration of the spirits of the ancestors and of nature.</page><page sequence="4">4 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC seasons, abundance of grain, and even the main materials of which musical instruments are made (see the pa yin classification of instruments (Needham 1962; Kartomi 1990:38-39). In insular Southeast Asia's early Animist-Hindu Buddhist societies, the cosmic directions were similarly linked to specific spiritual, natural, and socio-political concepts, including colours, metals, winds, seasons, and associated socio-political behaviour. Thus, people in Java?as in Aceh?tend to construct buildings or fields and conceive of their performing arts in relation to the dominant spatial relations of the cardinal points, which are "embedded in (their) system of beliefs" (Bar-Yosef 2001:435).3 When Javanese court dancers perform in the usual rectangular pavilion, they orient themselves toward north, south, east, and west, and in relation to a central fifth point in that square. "Space is square, one moves through it rectangularly..." (Geertz 1960:31). Thus court dancers are taught to move "to the north", or to the south, east, or west, or to the centre (Brakel-Papenhuijzen 1992:183-200). Three of the four spatial concepts applied in Aceh?the upstream downstream, the cardinal directional and the geometric?are imbued with Animist-Hindu-Buddhist thought, while two?the geometric and the central point-in-a-circle?also possess Acehnese-Muslim connotations. Whether associated with Islam or not, traditional Acehnese concepts of space are believed to have originated in their adat (B.I.), that is, traditional customs and moral order derived from the ancestors. Deriving from local Animist beliefs and augmented by early Hindu-Buddhist ideas that permeated the region and then with another layer of Muslim ideas added on top, adat "provided the cosmological order, the primary ... explanation that rendered the world intelligible and informed one how to act in it" (Acciaioli 1985:153). This amalgam of Animist, Hindu-Buddhist, and Muslim ideas has clearly influenced the particular visual designs and artistic ideas lying behind their artistic creativity across the arts. Concepts of space in Aceh The upstream-downstream concept of space According to the folklore and historical sources, the upstream-downstream (unong-barohf space orientation, known also in Malay or Indonesian as ulu-ilir or hulu-hilir, is of ancient origins. The Acehnese people took their spatial bearings from the Bukit Barisan mountain ranges that extend from north-west to south-east down the west-central backbone of Sumatra and the rivers that run from their upland sources down to the coast.5 In the virtual absence of a 3 For discussions of similar associative direction-colour cosmologies in Burma, Thailand, Java, etc, see essays by H. L. Shorto, A. Turton, and A. Christie in Milner (1978). Hoop (1949) provides a good overview of pan-Indonesian Animist and Hindu-Buddhist motifs. 4 Foreign words in this article are in Acehnese unless otherwise noted ("B.I." refers to Bahasa Indonesia, "B.M." to Bahasa Melayu, and "Ar." to Arabic). 5 Data used here on Acehnese arts and culture derive mainly from my field trips throughout Aceh in 1982-83 and 2003 and unpublished booklets on music and dance issued by research teams employed by the Department of Education and Culture (Isjkarim et al. 1980-81; Burhan and Idris 1986-87; Idris et al. 1993). The historical data is mainly</page><page sequence="5">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 5 sustainable road system till recent decades, the many local rivers served as the main means of overland travel. To the question: "Where are you going?" one would commonly answer either "upstream" (u kuala kreueng) or "downstream" (u pucok kreueng)6 Given that most rivers in Aceh happen to run approximately from south to north, north to south, or between northeast and southwest (the latter along part of Aceh's west coast), the upstream-downstream concept roughly coincides with the grid of the four cardinal points. Thus, the saying tunong baroh, timu barat, which translates as "from upstream and downstream, from east and west" (Bakar et al. 2001:61), refers to the four cardinal directions, but is engendered by an ulu-ilir view of the world. A common motif found in Acehnese and other Sumatran folk stories is the implementation of a hero's desire to seek his fortune: travelling downstream to found a village, spread Islam, or prove himself before a king, or travelling upstream to find a princess or gather wealth in the form of gold or forest products.7 Until recently, this ulu-ilir concept also strongly influenced the ways in which people obtained natural materials in order to make objects needed in daily life, including houses, musical instruments, and other objets d'art. Indeed, in many parts of Sumatra, "the juxtaposition of upstream and downstream is a significant one" (Andaya 1993:13).8 The dichotomy also had its political and social class parameters, with downstream people regarding their upstream counterparts as being somewhat "primitive" and belonging to an inferior social class. Binary oppositions inherent in the upstream-downstream dichotomy that are still extant include the highlands/lowlands, mountains/coasts, forests/swamplands, natural from Christian Snouck Hurgronje's two-volume book The Acehnese (1906) and a few other Dutch sources from the colonial era. 6 For definitions or brief descriptions of such terms as this, see the glossary at the end of this article. 7 As documented in Malay belletristic literature over the past millennium, the so-called "uplanders" around Sumatra's and Malaya's coasts have provided the "coastal dwellers" and traders in coastal urban centres where foreign and local merchants plied their trade, with gold and other minerals, spices, and forest and agricultural products from upriver. 8 Although Andaya was writing here about the Jambi and Palembang areas of Sumatra (in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), the upstream-downstream dichotomy also applied in many parts of Aceh, as documented by written sources and folklore (especially stories related to the origins of the Peureulak and Pas? kingdoms). For example, an Acehnese folk story recounts how the upstream Muslim king of Seumali, who wanted to spread Islam, founded a kingdom near Peureulak. After some years he took a sampan downstream with his entourage till he reached the mouth of the Pas? river where he founded a new kingdom called Seumeurlang (now in Kecamatan Samudera) for his son Muhammad to rule as chieftain, then another in the forest to the south called Balik Rimba to be ruled by his son Ahmad. Then he founded and built a mosque in another kingdom between those of his two sons, both of whom, however, were childless. Muhammad acquired a daughter by cutting open a bamboo shoot and finding a baby girl inside. Ahmad found a son by stealing him from his guardian?an elephant, who died encrazed at his loss; later the villagers found his jaw in the soil and named their village Jungka Gajah ("Jaw of an Elephant") (M. Husin Amin, pers. com.).</page><page sequence="6">6 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC sources/production, primordial culture/civilisation, the sacred/the profane, nature/culture, and the upstream versus downstream artistic styles.9 Thus, in her study of Acehnese visual arts and crafts, Leigh distinguished between "upland styles"?as in the multi-coloured reed plaited mats?and "coastal styles"?as in the gold-thread embroidery using the four basic colours (Leigh 1989:30). Similarly, the music and dance forms associated with upstream areas were regarded as different, rustic, and unpolished, practised by artistically and magically talented people who would sometimes travel to downstream areas to ply their arts and earn their keep.10 For example, young handsome boy dancers with beautiful voices who starred in seudati performances were traditionally offspring of poor Acehnese highland parents or slaves from Nias, who earned their way in travelling seudati troupes (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:11, 221).11 To this day some of the best singers (aneuk syah?) in well-known urban dance troupes hail from poor upland areas (Ibu Aisyah, pers. com., 1982). The upstream-downstream concept of directional space arising out of the people's reliance on rivers also lies behind the making of the venerable great frame drum called rapa 'i Pase, the Acehnese musical instrument par excellence. Its ergological attributes are still linked to upstream forest and downstream directions and spaces, especially as practised among artists in rural villages (ureueng gampong lam) in its home area, North Aceh's Pas? (Pasai, B.M.) district, after which this particular kind of rapa'i was named. Located near present-day Aron, Pas? was the capital of the late thirteenth century Malay speaking kingdom of Samudera Pasai (B.M.) which was one of the first two documented Muslim realms in Southeast Asia (map l).12 9 This was pointed out in discussion with Iwan Dzulvan Amir, who also commented that the ulu-ilir concept was probably created by coastal dwellers rather than the or ang gunung (upstream mountain people), as the Acehnese coastal aristocracy and their successors typically look down on "primitive" mountain dwellers, including the Gayo and Alas ethnic groups who live in the interior. Western colonial literature also contains accounts of "civilised white men penetrating the mysterious and primitive virgin forests of the dark interior", with the upstream forests retaining a mysterious, magical aura due to their natural setting and the belief that spirits inhabit the trees and other natural objects (pers. com., ibid.). 10 As Stokes noted, "the 'places' constructed through music involve notions of difference and social boundary. They also organise hierarchies of a moral and political order" (Stokes 1994:3). 11 One such seudati boy said in his poetic dialogue (kisah) with his lead dalem (male adult seudati dancer): "I am a son of the upper reaches of the river" (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:11, 237). Snouck Hurgronje also wrote that a hero in Aceh was often spoken of as aneu ' tunong krueng ( "son of the upper reaches of the river ") and that downstream people were more "civilised" than upstream people (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:1, 34). 12 The thirteenth century Samudera Pasai kingdom was Malay-speaking, hence its Malay spelling: Pasai. At that time, ethnic Acehnese lived only in Greater Aceh and a few parts of Pidie and Daya (West Aceh). Remnants of this kingdom are still to be found in the area around Arun in North Aceh where the first great rapa 'i Pas? drums apparently originated and continue to be made to this day.</page><page sequence="7">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 7 Map 1. The Province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam. The reliance on rivers affected the way in which makers of the rapa 7 Pas? have traditionally built the instrument. On receiving a request to construct one, the makers, usually a father and son (or other apprentice) who are also shamans, travel upstream to a near-virgin area of forest to select a suitable tree, usually a tualang (honey-bee) tree, which must be very tall and have a broad trunk.13 Each stage of the ensuing process of felling and preparing the tree is 13 The general name for very tall trees in Sumatran and Malay peninsular jungles is tualang (botanical names: Koompassia malaccensis, Koompassia parvifolia); on the size</page><page sequence="8">8 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC preceded by spiritual procedures after the manner of their frame drum-making ancestors, whom they believe date back to the thirteenth century Malay-speaking Samudera-Pasai kingdom. After singing prayers at the foot of the tree and promising to fell it in a way that is not destructive of surrounding trees, they utter more prayers before cutting off the lower trunk. Finding a suitable tree, requesting permission to fell it, cutting it down, removing its lower trunk, and partly gouging its pith out may take several months. Then they sail downstream with the lower trunk till they reach their home village where they may work on it with several helpers for six months or so. They continue to gouge out the pith until it has a thin, waisted bracelet shape. After carving two or more sets of parallel rills around its middle and lower outer surface with smooth sections in between, they polish it to a beautiful finish. Finally, they fit a large piece of treated cow skin across the drum's head, which may have a diameter of up to a metre or more, tucking the ends into the rim of the upper body. When the drum is presented to its new owner, traditionally in exchange for a buffalo or other similarly valuable item, the maker leads a mystical rapa 'i Pas? naming ceremony, bestowing on it an anthropomorphic proper name such as Rapa'i Raja Kuneng (Yellow King Frame Drum). The instrument is then suspended from a frame with twenty or so rapai Pas? owned by other villagers and played by a village team. Sets of these great frame drums are often played in competitions between two or more villages. Revered and protected from theft by being stored in a safe place in the home, each instrument is handed down from generation to generation as a family heirloom. The spiritual aura that surrounds these beautiful heirlooms is connected to that of the primordial upstream forests where the bodies of the drums originated. Their mystical power derives from their closeness to nature, from the ecologically and spiritually correct manner in which responsible and spiritually gifted men make them, and from their powerful sound, perceived as being most beautiful and unified when heard from afar. Many Acehnese associate them with supernatural energy, the spirits of nature and the ancestors and?in syncretic fashion?with the religion of Islam. Sets of rapa'i Pas?, for example, are traditionally played in large numbers, often in competition between village troupes, so that their players can acquire ?leum?e (mystical knowledge),14 enabling them to take part in rituals that mark life cycle and religious feasts and celebrations. Rapa'i Pas? can also serve as a signalling agent between villages.15 of these trees, see Foxworthy (1926). Bees often build hives in them, presumably because their height provides protection (Goldsworthy 1978:1). If they contain hives, they are called a sialang tree in the Siak area of Riau. For a drawing of a tualang "bee tree", the trunk of which is gouged out to make a rapa'i Pase, see Hasselt (1882:vol 3/1, pi. LXXXVII). 14 According to AH Akbar (pers. com.), there are various sub-branches of ?leum?e, for example, ?leum?e keubai "knowledge of invulnerability" and ?leum?e sih? " black magic". 15 The rapa'i Pas?'s syncretic religious associations are exemplified by the fact that despite their mystical associations Muslim prayers are said before a performance and some</page><page sequence="9">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 9 The rapa'i Pas?, influenced by ulu-ilir directional thinking, differs radically in shape, size, sound and venerability from the smaller and more ubiquitous frame drums, such as the medium-sized rapa 'i dab?h and the slightly smaller rapa 'i geurimpheng and rapa 'i pulot. Although valued, these smaller frame drums are made much more quickly and use only local materials at hand; moreover, they are normally undecorated with rills or other designs, as are typically the case with the rapa 'i Pas?. The cardinal directional concept of space As has already been mentioned, the concept of the four cardinal directions with a fifth point in the centre dates back to the cosmological beliefs of the ancient Chinese and to Animist-Hindu-Buddhist times. In some parts of the archipelago to this day?in Hindu Bali, for example?the pairs of cardinal directions on the two grids are seen as continua "between polar extremes" (Hobart 1978:5-7),16 each direction being associated with a particular colour?east with white, south with red, west with yellow and north with black (Brinkgreve and Stuart-Fox 1992:148) According to this Southeast Asian, including Acehnese, cosmology of the cardinal directions, east is associated with white or silver and the metal silver, south with red and an alloy of gold and copper, west with yellow and the metal gold, north with black and the metal iron, and the centre point with mixed colours and a four-metal alloy, as the grid in diagram 1 shows.17 The colours associated with the cardinal directions?white or silver, red, yellow or gold, and black?influence both the visual and the performing arts, including traditional embroideries, modern paintings, artists' costumes, and stage backdrops. These four colours are dominant in the elaborate bridal couches characteristic of the various cultural sub-areas of Aceh (see illustration 1), sometimes with the Muslim-associated green colour added, as befits a culture that prides itself on its strongly Muslim identity and respect for elements of Perso-Arabic arts. The colours are used in the kasab (gold-thread) embroidery designs on cushion covers, wall hangings, woven cloths, and other artistic genres. They are also dominant in the costumes of musicians and dancers. song texts have Muslim themes. The largest ("mother"(zWw&amp;)) specimens, in particular, are attributed with ancient origins and imbued with animist as well as Sufi-Muslim spiritual and social meaning (Kartomi 2004). 16 In Hindu Bali, for example, this idea is expressed in the linking of north-south and east west to the kaja-kelod ritual axis, meaning "to the mountain?to the sea" (Bandem and de Boer 1981:32-33). 17 A Balinese m?ndala links the cardinal directions with colours, deities, ritual sounds and days, and ritual instruments or containers (Brinkgreve and Stuart-Fox 1992:149).</page><page sequence="10">10 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Pusat/Anekawarna/Campuran keempat jenis logam Centre/Multicoloured/ V^ Alloy of the four metals Barat/Kuning/Emas West/Yellow/Gold S elatan/Mer ah/ Su asa South/Red/Suasa (Mixture of gold &amp; copper) Diagram 1. Cardinal directions, colours, and metals in Aceh and other formerly Indianised states of Southeast Asia (based on a seminar by Denys Lombard on "Concepts of time and space in Indonesia", University of Sydney, 23 October 1986). Reproduced with permission from Leigh (1989:172). Although the available evidence suggests that some of the details of colour usage have changed in Aceh over the past century, costumes traditionally focused on the four basic colours. In the 1890s, the adult male seudati dancers (spelled sadati in Snouck Hurgronje 1906) wore white shirts (except for the sy?h, who wore black), black trousers, and a dark sar?ng and headcloth. One or two lead boy dancers (also called sadati) wore "a kupiah or hat with a golden crown (tamp?"), a coat with many gold buttons ... but no loin-cloth. He (was) ... covered with feminine ornaments, such as anklets, bracelets, rings, a chain around the neck, and a silver girdle round the waist", with a colourful embroidered kerchief "over his shoulders" and a fan held in one hand (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:11, 232, photographs in ibid.:226, 224, 231). Since the early 1960s, male seudati dancers (such as those shown in illustration 2) have normally worn a white (rather than a black) bajee saman (long-sleeved, buttoned, fitting shirt), white babah keumarah (trousers), a red and gold sar?ng kasab from waist to above the knee, a rencong (dagger) slipped into the left front of a dark red cloth belt, and a round tengkuluk head-band with a high rooster-like crest, while lead boy dancers continued to add female-associated jewellery and other items.18 Due to suspected pederasty, the young handsome boy component in seudati became the object of increasing ulama-Xz? criticism from the 1950s. However, boy artists continued to appear in some performances, as witnessed by Ali Akbar (pers. com.), Lance Castles (pers. com.), and others in the 1980s and 1990s. They are now apparently rare.

Thus, unmarried girls who dance the contemplatively sad pho dance usually wear long-sleeved yellow blouses, black trousers, a dark red or dark green wrap-around sar?ng kasab falling to just above the knee, a dark red or dark blue slendang (with a scarf falling around the neck and its ends tucked under a gold or silver belt on both sides of the front chest down to the thighs), antique jewellery (earrings, anklets, and bracelets), and wearing their hair either in a knot sloping slightly to the right with white flowers attached or covered by ajilbab (Muslim head scarf, as in illustration 3). The unmarried girls who perform the seudati inong or laweuet and meuseukat dances wear costumes that are similar to those used for ph? (as in illustration 4).

The geometric concept of space Like the other three concepts of space, the geometric concept of space influences the Acehnese approach to some genres of the performing and visual arts. The predilection for decorative design, which is often expressed with consummate artistry in traditional architecture, wood carving, weaponry, and pottery, also governs the weaving of cloth and making of gold-thread (kasab) embroidery and jewellery that are seen at their elaborate best at weddings and other rites of passage (Leigh 1989:30, 54-76, 89, 93-95). Acehnese designs embroidered or sewn onto costumes, or carved on jewellery or the walls of houses, are basically geometric, with or without added plant, bird and other designs. This predilection for geometric design?single and parallel lines, squares, rectangles, triangles (for example, the decorated triangular tumpal motive), aces of diamonds, circles and half-circles, ovals and half-ovals, figures of eight, stars, concentric circles, concentric ovals, spirals, cyclic waves, concentric squares and rectangles, keys, rhombs, oblique equilateral parallelogram shapes, and Islamic crescent moons and stars?has exerted a strong and lasting influence on Aceh's visual arts, from traditional carvings and embroideries to modern works by Aceh's most famous contemporary painter, A. D. Pirous (b. 1933).19 Although geometric ideas and ornamentation are of pre-Muslim origin, the predilection for their use in Muslim cultures, including that of Aceh, is usually attributed to the fact that Islam, strictly interpreted, prohibits artistic representations of living beings and other possible idols.</page><page sequence="15">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 15 The geometric motives used in Aceh are of ancient origin; indeed, they resemble the motives used in other Southeast Asian art20 dating from the migrations from Yunnan and the place of D?ng-son in Annam to the archipelago from c. 2500-1500 B.C.E. (Heine-Geldern 1932:519-37; see also Heekeren 1958). Among the products of D?ng-son era art that were transplanted throughout the archipelago were the magnificent bronze D?ng-son drums that were found in many archaeological diggings. Their upper surfaces, covered with decorative geometric, flora, and fauna designs, feature either squat eggcup shapes or elongated hourglass shapes that resemble contemporary Acehnese rapa'i Pas? frame drums. When the Hindus arrived from India in the early Common Era they apparently found these geometric decorative designs to be well-established and expressed in various locally developed forms. The ornamental surface design of circular parallel rills carved around the body of a rapa'i Pas? has both visual and acoustic effects. These rills have mystical associations (Ali Akbar, pers. com.), as the circle is an old Acehnese geometrical shape that symbolises completeness (Noerdin Daood, pers. com.). They not only serve as the rapa 'i Pas? 's distinctive ornamental feature but also to improve its acoustic quality when the drumhead is struck: by interrupting and varying the length of the fibres of the wood, they expand the vibrations of the fundamental and the higher-pitched overtones and alter the drum's acoustic properties, creating a richer, fuller sound.21 The specimen shown in illustration 6 has a total of twenty-three circular parallel lines incised close together on the upper and lower surfaces of its curved, waisted wooden body, including two lines near the head, seven lines on the upper part of the body, and seven lines on the lower part, with another seven lines incised on the circular rim of the base itself. The central-point-in-a-circle concept of space The central-point-in-a-circle concept features in the art of many Southeast Asian societies; for example, circular dances around a central dancer or object are found in most of Indonesia from Bali to the east. The same space concept in Aceh, however, is associated with that of its dominant religion, Islam, which shares with the above areas a central-point-in-a-circle concept of space. Islamic art began to become embedded in Acehnese culture through contact with Muslim countries from at least as early as the late thirteenth century, the time of the first Southeast Asian royal conversions and creation of the first Southeast Asian sultanates at Peurulak and Pasai (located in present-day Aceh). Leigh's study of contemporary Acehnese visual arts found not only ancient Southeast Asian geometric designs (such as the tumpal or decorated triangle)22 and stylised flora shapes, especially leaves, but also elaborate mosaic-like 20 For a good overview of early Southeast Asian motives, see Hoop (1949). 21 This hypothesis holds that the rills thin out the instrument's heavy wooden structure by cutting the longitudinal reference of the optic fibres, thereby enhancing the vibrations and maximising the production of brighter or higher-pitched overtones. I am indebted to Peter Handsworth (pers. com., October 2003) for this hypothesis. 22 The tumpal design is found in the large structure next to the Gunongan, the seventeenth century architectural artwork in Banda Aceh, as well as in Javanese batik designs.</page><page sequence="16">16 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC designs and gold-thread embroidery belonging to Islamic culture. For example, the latter was probably influenced by the Mughal court culture of Gujerat, and other forms by Turkish contact23 (Leigh 1989:30). Illustration 6.

The basic Arabic-Islamic concept of space referred to by Bar-Josef (see above) focuses on a central point within a circle, for example, a circular town design around a central mosque. Thus, the structure of the metallic thread 23 During Aceh's "Golden Age" (the early seventeenth century), the Mughals of Gujerat were exercising their power in the Indian subcontinent and the Turkish Ottoman Empire was in a period of ascendancy. Aceh had relations with both powers.</page><page sequence="17">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 17 (kasab) embroidery shown in illustration 7 comprises a central circle (depicted as a tight spiral) surrounded by several concentric circles or star-shaped circular lines, within three outer concentric squares, and with a cyclical border pattern design featuring a variety of geometric and plant shapes. The glass disc sewn over its circular centre point emphasises the Perso-Arabic spatial concept outlined above (a point at the centre of a circular periphery). The decorative border patterns are created from symmetrical geometric designs based on cyclic repetition, as in this and other embroidered cushion covers (kasab) from Meulaboh, West Aceh, home of the pho dance. Its basic colours are gold on red, with blue added. Some embroideries have gold or silver and red geometrical designs with black borders, with a structure comprising concentric diamond shapes surrounded by concentric squares, as in the geometric design below the buraq (heavenly bird) in the lower section of the 1982 s?rigraphie print entitled "Sura Isra II/Homage to Mother" by the Meulaboh-born artist A. D. Pirous (illustration 8). This is coloured mainly in red and gold, with yellow and white calligraphy and a black border and sky. As Pirous explained in a letter to the author, his print was inspired by kasab25 embroideries made by his mother for his sister's 1937 wedding in Meulaboh when he was an impressionable five-year old, an experience that has influenced his approach to art ever since.26 24 Kasab, meaning metallic thread (in gold, silver, or copper), is also a term meaning a shiny work of embroidery art with metallic thread used on cotton cloth; thus kasab bantai (B.A.) means "a metal thread-embroidered cushion cover". The metallic thread is used as a supplementary weft, creating a slightly raised pattern on a silk or cotton background (Leigh 1989:80). Some excellent metal-threaded pieces are referred to as kasab blayat, where blayat is used to designate a piece of very high quality and refinement. 25 Pirous wrote that his mother was a very talented artist who developed "a high degree of virtuosity" in her craftsmanship. Like other female embroidery artists on Aceh's west and south coast, her many embroideries were based on her concept of traditional geometric, floral, and bird designs, including the buraq, a mythical bird believed to have taken the Prophet Muhammad to the seventh heaven, and which Pirous drew in the upper part of his work. His mother believed that one step taken by the buraq covered a distance as far as one can see (Pirous, written communication, 2004). 26 As Pirous wrote to me, one of his paintings that features Acehnese geometric designs is the multi-media "When the Earth Quakes" (1982; 162 x 207 cm, made of fibre glass, acrylic, gold leaf on canvas, and panels), featuring two back-to-back triangles in a square frame (front cover, Buchari et al. 1985). Another painting presents an isosceles triangle and parallel lines (no. 42G in Buchari et al. 1985:85), while another comprises concentric squares and a circle in the smallest square, a cyclic AAAAA design, and concentric rectangles (no. 215, ibid.:74). Yet another features concentric circles (ibid.:25).</page><page sequence="18">18 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC ^Vv^ Illustration 7.

Aspects of the geometric, cardinal directional, and central-point-in-a circle concepts of space are also expressed in the artists' costumes and the backdrops of performance arenas (such as the cushions and the elaborate bridal couch illustrated above, which is used in the ph? dance, see illustration 3). Moreover, geometric and central-point-in-a-circle shapes determine the mostly</page><page sequence="20">20 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC symmetrical and cyclic spatial formations into which groups of musicians and dancers move in a performance arena (see figures A-C below). It may even be said that the cyclic geometric patterns used for borders in embroideries are analogous to certain symmetrical formations of dancers and/or musicians on a stage, as may be seen, for example, in illustration 9, where the dancers, by alternately kneeling upright and bending forwards, produce a geometric "border pattern design" effect. The melodies sung in unison or chorus in musical items and dances may also feature symmetrical, cyclic structures (see transcription 1). The typically four-square melodies often comprise four balanced, cyclic (though varied) phrases of, say, sixteen beats each, beginning with (i) a melodic statement or "question" (ending with melodic ascent), (ii) a transposed re-statement of the first line as a melodic sequence or an "answer" (ending with a descent), (iii) a tonally varied but rhythmically similar melodic phrase to the one used in the first line, and (iv) a line that resembles the first but ends with a descending melodic cadence. The whole melody comprises a single unit that can be cyclically repeated as many times as the occasion demands. Illustration 9.

Clearly the spatial elements of the music, dance, and the visual arts display a remarkable unity of creative thought; they all use and develop similar artistic ideas, mostly including symmetrical forms, modes of variation, and patterns of redundancy. The main exception that "proves" the orderliness and symmetry rule is the l?nglong ("disorderly, in disarray")28 formation that occurs 28 The word l?nglong is also used to mean a bankrupt person (Bakar et al. 2001:514).</page><page sequence="22">22 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC near the beginning of a seudati dance performance, during which the dancers move in disorderly random directions. Floor plans for dancer-musicians After explaining the basic geometric formations and floor movements below, I shall briefly analyse their application in three of the most representative dances: (1) the male seudati dance, also known as seudati agam (lit., "male seudati") and its female equivalent laweuet (from salaweuet, salawat (Ar.)), also known as seudati inong (lit., "female seudati"); (2) the femalepho dance, depicting grief, and (3) the female or male meuseukat dance, in which a row of kneeling dancers perform body percussion and body movements between their group responses to the singing of the alternating aneuk syah?. Then I shall describe the sitting or standing formations and body movements of the group players of the four main frame drum genres, traditionally performed only by men: rapa'i Pas?, rapa'i dab?h, rapa'igeurimpheng, marapa'ipulot. The sequence of dance formations and movements are decided by a troupe under their sy?h's leadership before a performance begins. The sy?h (marked * in the diagrams below) is responsible for planning, demonstrating, and leading the dancers and/or musicians in their rehearsals and performances of the formations and the types and sequences of body movements, and for their coordination with the musical sounds produced, that is, the solo and group singing, group frame drum playing, and/or group body percussion music. The sy?h is assisted by a hierarchy of seven other dancers, with the four ap?t?the ap?t (sy?h) or assistant leader, ap?t wie (also, wie) or assistant leader on the left, ap?t likok or assistant rear leader, and ap?t uneuen (also, uneuen) or assistant leader on the right?being of middling rank, and the three sago?the sago or left front dancer, sago or left rear dancer, and likot sago or rear edge dancer?being of lowest rank (as shown in diagram 2). dancers D ?

The vocalists, who are called aneuk syah?, aneuk dhiek, or aneuk seudati, alternate with each other to sing partly improvised pant?n (rhyming quatrains) to metred or non-metred melodies, with each singer freely adding improvised melodic ornamentation to the melodic line, according to his or her musical abilities. Usually the first soloist performs a few verses, after which the other soloist joins in near the end of a verse as the first soloist tails off and then stops to rest. The practice of singing in an overlapping, alternating sequence developed because it is too strenuous for one individual to sing unaided in performances that may last all night. This technique produces a seamless vocal performance and also allows the singers time and respite to maintain a high standard of melodic invention and poetic commentary in the largely improvised and often topical song texts. The beauty and complexity of the vocal style produced varies between performances, depending on the atmosphere of the occasion, the vocalist's talent, and the skills and experience acquired. Intangible aspects, such as audience appreciation and the type of performance event, help determine the vocalists' enthusiasm, creativity, and effectiveness in performance (Marzuki Hassan, pers. com., July 2004). When the lead singer alternates his or her segment of a melody?as, for example, Phrase A of the rat?b meuseukat melodic line in transcription l30?with a segment sung by the chorus of dancers or instrumentalists?for example, the segment marked "Chorus" between phrases A and B?the length and nature of the alternating segment is decided beforehand in rehearsal. Melodies are often "symmetrical" in the sense that they comprise a rising first phrase (such as Phrase A) that ends inconclusively, followed by a descending phrase (such as Phrase B) which answers and completes the melodic statement by forming a convex melodic contour in the second phrase. Members of the chorus may also surprise the audience by singing short melodic segments with a repeat of a long phrase by the soloist, as in measures 7 and 8, 14 and 15 of transcription 1. Usually the chorus sings only the basic notes of a phrase and with less ornamentation than the soloist (or pair of soloists). Its vocal responses are also performed to simpler dance movements than occur in the sections in which the dancers only move or dance without singing. A close comparison of the soloist's and chorus' renditions of the rat?b meuseukat melody in the transcription shows minor variations of rhythm, pitch, melisma, and melodic ornamentation, not only between the soloist's (or pair of soloists') and chorus' renditions, but also between the soloist's own renditions. Soon after the soloist begins, the chorus enters with a rhythmic, finger-snapping sound on each beat and then changes to a rhythmic motive comprising an anacrusis followed by a double clap on the breast on the second and fourth beats of the quadruple-metric unit.31 30 A recording of this excerpt may be found on Kartomi (1998:track 1). 31 Tonal and rhythmic analysis of the music lies beyond the scope of this article.</page><page sequence="24">24 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Basic geometric dance formations In contemporary practice, usually between eight and twelve dancers and a pair of alternating singers standing on one side form linear and other geometric formations. Choreographic floor plans for Acehnese dancer-musicians, as for musician-dancers discussed in the section on the rapa'i genres, are always designed with an eye for the balance and symmetry of the corporate geometric shape. They include the (i) linear or parallel-linear formations, representing communal order and balance; (ii) circular/oval or half-circular/oval, representing communal unity and the Muslim symbol of the new moon (bintang buleuen); (iii) square, rectangular, or circular with a middle point, representing the Perso-Arabic concept of a town with the main mosque in the centre or a dance design with the leader in the centre; (iv) triangular/half-diamond-shaped, representing the gable of an Acehnese traditional house or the shape of the Acehnese tumpang cake, symbolising protection and hospitality respectively (Noerdin Daood, pers. com., July 2004); and (v) the puta taloe ("twisted rope") formation, with interweaving dancers moving around a circle, symbolising strength and power.

Formations containing one or more straight lines are seen as symbolising parts of an important symbol of Acehnese identity, the rum?h Aceh (traditional Acehnese house).32 A row of dancers (saf A(i)) is seen to symbolise the top roof-line of an Acehnese house or communal unity (Noerdin Daood, pers. com., July 2004). A square or rectangular formation that contains an inner concentric square or rectangle is called pha rangkang, where pha literally means "thigh" and rangkang means "a single men's hut in a field" (A(iii)). The four points of the outer square represent the pillars of an Acehnese house and the inner square the house itself (ibid.). A single circle formed by eight dancers As we have noted, the line and parallel lines are important elements of geometric design in other forms of Acehnese visual art.</page><page sequence="27">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 27 Standing at the cardinal and sub-cardinal points is called gl?ng, representing communal unity (A(iv), ibid.). A variant circle formation is called puta taloe (lit., "swirling rope"), with odd and even-numbered dancers' paths interweaving like folds in a rope as each group walks in staggered half circles around each of the eight points in the circle formation (A(v), ibid.), symbolising the rope-like strength of a unified communal group. Another variant of the basic circle design is the pair of adjacent circles or figure of eight formation called cicem po, where cicem literally means "bird" and po "respected" (A(vi)). As already mentioned, circular formations by dancers or musicians around a performer or object located at the central point, as in the (at times) circular formations of the seudati, laweuet, pho, and meuseukat dances, resemble the geometric Perso-Arabic idea that the holy city of Mecca lies on an axis connecting heaven and earth, and the view that the ideal city circles around a central mosque. Dance formations featuring concentric circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles also occur. Along with the ordered linear, parallel, square, rectangular, and circular formations, a disordered formation and several linking formations may be found. In seudati, for example, the ordered linking formation called puta taloe (A(v)) may be followed by the disordered l?nglong ("moving in disarray" formation, as explained above), which in turn may be followed by the ordered bintang buleuen (lit., "star and moon", that is, half-circle or half-oval) formation, with the sy?h in the middle, then the ordered tampong (lit., "roof-top line") formation. Finally, the freer manok ("rooster") formation, with acrobatic movements, may be performed as well (Noerdin Daood, pers. com., March 2003). In contemporary dances, the performers may form various geometric shapes: for example, a pair of bintang buleuen half-ovals joining in an oval (as in the meusare-sare ["mutual help"] dance created by Yuzlizar (Burhan and Idris 1986-87:133-36)), &amp;pi (Greek letter) shape (as in the resam bereume ["habit of wet rice farming"] dance (ibid.: 147)), and an isosceles triangle in a rectangle (as in a version of the ranub lampuan ["betel-nut in a tray welcome"] dance (Idris et al. 1993:142)).33 Examples from the ph? dance discussed below include an irregular pentagon (C2(i)), a boat-like box on an upturned half-oval shape (as in the bineuih ["procession"] formation, C2(ii)), and a diamond within or protruding like a house gable from the top of a rectangle (as in the ayon aneuk formation, C2(vi) and C2(vii)). This list of formations is far from complete; the artists' creativity demands that they be allowed to construct other geometric shapes in dance, musical performances, and the visual arts, including artists' costume designs. In some dances the sy?h may add various more complex formations than those mentioned above, especially in kreasi baru (B.I., "new creations"). The four basic floor movements of dancers are shown in figure B below (based on Idris et al. 1993:119-20). These are the "vertical" (vertikal, B.I.;, with four dancers in the front row moving to change places with their four opposite numbers in the back row, and vice versa (B(i)); the "horizontal" (horizontal, 33 Pirous's 1982 painting Demi Cahaya Pagi yang Cerner lang ("For the Morning Enlightenment") also comprises an isosceles triangle in a rectangle (Buchari et al. 1985:85).</page><page sequence="28">28 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC B.I.), with the front and back rows moving to the right and then the left to form one row (B(ii)); the "diagonal" (diagonal, B.I.), with four dancers forming an inner rectangle surrounded by the other four forming an outer rectangle and moving diagonally to change places with the closest dancer (B(iii)); and the "circular" (gl?ng), either comprising a pair of concentric circles or a single circle, as in B(iv), and focussing around a central point.34 Within the circle formations, the sy?h are free to direct dancers to move in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction (Noerdin Daood, pers. com., February 2003).

Circular. Geometric floor plans in selected dances I shall now discuss some applications of these basic floor plans or formations in the contexts of selected dances: (a) seudati, (b)pho, and (c) rat?b meuseukat. Formations of the seudati (seudati agam)y?&gt;r male dancers and laweuet (seudati inong) for female dancers (figure Cl)35 The time and place of origin of the most famous of all Acehnese dances, the male seudati or seudati agam (male seudati) and its female equivalent laweuet or seudati inong (female seudati, see figure Cl) are unknown. Snouck Hurgronje (1906:11, 221^47) and other Dutch writers documented its existence in the 1890s, noting that it was normally performed in competitions between two or more groups (ibid.: 122) and often featured one or two young boy solo dancer-singers wearing items of female dress such as fans and jewellery (ibid.:221) among a row of dancers and pair of solo singers. Seudati and laweuet were re-developed in the Pidie area and widely popularised throughout Aceh from the 1960s (Noerdin Daood, pers. com.). We also know that seudati was known a century ago as rat?b sadati (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:1, 21), where rat?b means "religious song with body movement", and performances?mostly by two or more competitive troupes?usually lasted from late evening to midday of the next day. Sadati36 is the "most characteristic ... of the religious rat?b ... performed by companies of from 15 to 20 men accompanied by a pretty boy in female dress who has been 35 The basic formations of laweuet are the same as for seudati. However, some of the movements and body percussion sounds and movements differ, as well as the overall dance style, the female dance movements being perceived as being more sar?e ("refined", "cool") and the male more ram? ("vigorous"). This topic, however, lies beyond the scope of this paper. 36 According to Snouck Hurgronje, the word sadati derives from y? sad?tJ, meaning "Oh my masters" (that is, words spoken by a handsome lead boy-dancer), while sadati means both a dance genre and "dancing boys". Further, he wrote, "The rat?b sadati always takes the form of a contest" (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:11, 222). The common Acehnese vowel sound "eu " apparently replaced the "a " in the first syllable of sadati throughout Aceh over the past century.</page><page sequence="30">30 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC specially trained for the purpose" (ibid.TI, 221-22). A century ago, the adult members of a sadati troupe often had a close admiring relationship with the lead dancer-singers (sadati), who were usually either handsome young boys bought from their parents by the troupe or sons of Niasan slaves, and were trained as dancer-singers (ibid.TI, 222). Snouck Hurgronje showed that the dance and sung poetry possessed erotic, even p?d?rastie, suggestiveness, while noting that the profession of a young sadati boy was not based on immoral purposes (ibid.).38 The inclusion of one or two seudati (post-Republic spelling) boys in troupes diminished from the 1950s due to ulama disapproval, though some troupes still included them in the late 1980s (Lance Castles, pers. com., January 2004). In a seudati troupe today, normally only eight men dance and sing responses to the two alternating solo singers (aneuk syah?); a troupe performs either singly or in competition with one or more other troupes, as in the annual seudati festivals that were allowed to resume in August 2003 and 2004 after ceasing for a few years due to the poor security situation. A seudati performance normally begins with a saleum (initial greeting dance), the first section proper in dances such as seudati and laweuet, during which the pair of vocalists?followed by the chorus of dancers?greet, thank, and ask forgiveness of all those present, seen and unseen, for any mistakes that may occur in the performance. A brief bak saman (lit., "trunk of the saman" [singing of text with body movement]) section follows, with seven of the dancers standing in a circular formation around the sy?h in the middle, thereby creating the central-point-in-circle formation illustrated in B(iv). Together they decide which saman (poetry and movement) they will perform in the sequence. After performing the likok ("dance configuration") section, the saman ("advice") and kisah ("story") sections are danced, with the vocalists and sy?h singing love, comic, or advice-filled poetry in the former and a story in the latter. In the lanieu (or ekstra [extra]) section, popular regional and national songs in Indonesian may be mixed with Acehnese. An often lengthy nasib ("rhythmic poetry")39 section 37 A photograph in Snouck Hurgronje (1906:11, 226) shows members of a male adult sadati troupe wearing dark head-cloths, trousers, and kain sarung (B.I., wrap-around torso cloths) with white shirts (except for the sy?h, who wears a dark shirt) performing in rat?b due position (kneeling on their heels), and a pair of young sadati boys wearing white shirts, a female slendang (long stole around the neck), anklets, bracelets, and fans performing an acrobatic back-flip. A "dancing boy" (ibid.:261) is shown wearing a patterned female blouse with matching head-cloth, dark trousers, armlets, bracelets, and anklets. 38 The seudati dance has changed in some details over the past century, though a thorough comparative study of the current regional styles with those noted by Snouck Hurgronje in the 1890s in Greater Aceh remains to be carried out. Snouck Hurgronje's description of religiously-based rat?b (ratib, Ar.) sadati performances that he observed in the 1890s included some transcribed and translated texts of the secular songs sung in one performance (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:1, 21, 244; II, 22X-41). 39 Nasib is defined as pertandingan dalam bentuk sajak yang diucapkan secara berirama (B.I., "competition in the form of rhythmically performed poetry", Bakar et al. 2001:629). Snouck Hurgronje defines it as "verses recited at a rat?b in Ach?h", but also as "an Arabic</page><page sequence="31">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 31 then begins, stretching far into the night, in which the aneuk syah? spontaneously improvise humorous or political and socially critical texts, and answer allusions and questions posed poetically?and always elegantly?in songs improvised by the vocalists of the other side. The winning side is decided by a jury and by audience acclaim.40 The basic geometric formations begin to appear in this opening seumbah: the dancers usually form a single row (sa?, with the sy?h positioned near the right end (facing the audience) and the ap?t sy?h and others in the hierarchy assuming corresponding positions (Cl(i)), after which they move into a two-row formation, with odd-numbered dancers in the front row (safbineh) and even-numbered ones in the back row (saf rueng), seated hierarchically as in diagram 2 above.41 In the seudati or laweuet dance sections, the sy?h may decide that the dancers will move into the pha rangkang formation. To do so, four of the dancers form a rectangle or square and the other four another rectangle or square around it. Sometimes they vary the concentric rectangles or squares by forming a half oval-shaped front row and a straight back row within the external rectangle (as in the second diagram in Cl(ii)).42 In the cicem po formation, the front four dancers form a circle that vertically adjoins another circle formed by the back row of dancers, thus constructing a figure-of-eight shape (as in A(vi) above). Two gl?ng ("circle") formations follow. In the first, the front four dancers move to form the front half of a complete circle, with the back four moving to join up the back half of the circle (as in A(iv) above). In the second, a relatively complex variant of gl?ng, a concentric rectangular formation is achieved by circular movement around the inner rectangle of dancers, with the other two pairs positioned on each side of the external rectangle changing positions with each other (Cl(iii). Somewhat similarly, the embroidery pattern in illustration 7 comprises a circle in the middle of a pair of concentric squares, thereby producing a static image rather than a moving one as is possible in dance. love poem" (Snouck Hurgronje 1906:11, 372). Further, he writes, "the most important parts (nasib and kisah) of the recitations in ... rat?b are in the distinctive sanja ' metres of Aceh" (ibid. :II, 77) 40 The above account of this dance structure is based on Noerdin Daood's unpublished text "Sekilas mengenai Tari Seudati Aceh", and has been amended on advice from Iwan Dzulvan Amir. 41 The following sequence of seudati dance sections is based on recent practice according to Isjkarim et al. (1980-81), Burhan and Idris (1986-87:124-27), and Idris et al. (1993:139-40). Each gives basically similar accounts. The main meuseukat formation is given in Isjkarim et al. (1980-81:114-15). 42 Concentric rectangles or squares and half-oval, oval, or circular shapes are also found in embroidery designs (as in illustration 7).</page><page sequence="32">32 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Figure Cl.

The diagrams in Idris et al. (1993) and Isjkarim et al. (1980-81)43 indicate the following shapes: a pentagon (C2(i)), a boat-like square on top of a half-oval shape (C2(ii)), a triangle or a closed half-oval shape (C2(iii), an open half-oval shape (C2(iv)), a pair of separate circles (C2(v)), a triangle in a rectangle (C2(vi)), a triangle partly protruding from a rectangle (C2(vii)), a closed half-oval containing a triangle (C2(viii)), and an isosceles triangle (C2(ix)). The central-point-in-a-circle concept of space is applied. Unlike the spirited, vigorous, and joyful seudati and laweuet dances, the ph? dance is contemplatively sad and gracefully lithe in character. It is performed only by unmarried girls, with a pair of female aneuk syah? singing verses in the Aneuk Jam?e dialect that is spoken in the kabupaten (districts) of West Daya and South Aceh. The name ph? is said to derive from peuba-epo, meaning meuratap, "to mourn in song and dance". It once took the form of a centuries-old ritual dirge dance, with mourners dancing in a circle around a corpse, as referred to in classical hikayat (sung oral literature); in recent times ph? is danced to sung verses recounting the tragic story of Madion and Malelang, a young South Acehnese brother and sister, who were sentenced to death as victims of slander (see the stylised dance formations C2(i)-(ii)). The more recent dance form called ph? apparently developed after the enforcement of the Muslim ban on ritual expressions of grief began to spread, perhaps several decades, or even a century, ago. One of the pair of aneuk syah? begins the first scene, the saleum (greeting and prayer for the well-being of all present), by singing a welcome to all those present, seen and unseen, while eight to twelve or more dancers enter. First the dancers form two parallel rows (saf dua), then each odd-numbered dancer in the back row moves diagonally forwards to form a single row (saf), a reversal of the process shown in A(ii)). The dancers bow to the audience with downcast eyes, holding their open hands vertically together in front of their chests. The sad story of the two main characters, Madion and Malelang, begins to be told by the singers in the following bineuih ("procession") section, as the dancers move introspectively in a clockwise direction around a pentagon formation (C2(i)). At this point, the sy?h may vary that structure to create the ticempho ("flying") structure, which creates a dance formation resembling the wings of a bird in flight (Noerdin Daood, pers. com., March 2003). Another alternative is to create a boat-like square formation on top of a half-oval shape (C2(ii), ibid.). The tren dar? haro ("the bride descends to bathe") section then follows (C2(iii) and (iv)). In it the dancers form a meuratap (sad singing) formation that 43 The diagrams below are based on the slightly varied versions of the dance in which the story of Madion and Malelang is told, appearing in Idris et al. (1993:130-31) and Isjkarim et al. (1980-81:179-87).</page><page sequence="34">34 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC may comprise an isosceles triangle, and then a half-moon shape with three dancers following the sy?h, three following the ap?t, and two staying "on the rear edge". All the while they perform movements depicting the bathing of a bride before the groom joins her for the actual wedding ceremony. Meanwhile an appropriate pant?n text is sung about the bride's sad feelings as she prepares to leave her family home. The half-moon shape is also symbolic of sadness. (This paragraph is based on a personal communication from Noerdin Daood.) In the following jak kutimang ("sway back and forth") section, the eight dancers form two parallel lines, followed by two clockwise moving circles (C2(v)), and then two pairs standing at the end of a rectangle watching while two other pairs stand in a diamond or circular formation and depict the swaying of a baby in a hammock (C2(vi)), their movements lovingly suggesting a mother singing her child to sleep, while the pair of vocalists sing a lullaby text. The shape of the diamond formation resembles that of a wajik (traditional Acehnese) cake, which is a commonly used symbol of Acehnese identity (Noerdin Daood, pers. com., March 2003). In the next section, entitled ayon aneuk ("sway a child"), two pairs of dancers form a similar rectangle while the other two pairs form a diamond shape projecting outside it and depict the swaying of a baby (C2(vii)). The sy?h stands in front and the others group into a threesome and a foursome respectively, moving to depict the way in which a mother sways her baby in a hammock. The protruding half-diamond shape reflects the gable of an Acehnese house that protects the baby inside (Noerdin Daood, pers. com., March 2003). At this point, as in the latter part of a seudati or laweuet performance, the troupe normally adds some crowd-pleasing popular dances and songs in Indonesian and Acehnese. This may continue for some time if the performance is not part of a competition, in which case the traditional rules are applied strictly and less opportunity exists to perform modern dances and songs. The various texts of these so-called laneui (lit., "moving through") or ekstra ("extra") pieces may serve to provide edification, satisfy a sponsor, or simply entertain. On special occasions, the song texts performed may offer advice (for example, to a bridal couple at their wedding), tell a story or jokes appropriate for the occasion, or refer to topical events, with appropriate dances to boot. An example is peuleuet manok ("gold-trimmed chicken/rooster"),44 in which the singer performs a classical text while two parallel lines of four dancers form the two-row formation safdua followed by a half-oval or U-shape, with three dancers at the rear forming a triangle (C2(viii)). In another example, the vocalists sing a text entitled bineuih bungong rawatu ("a heavenly bird flower procession"), in which the dancers stand in two parallel rows (safdua), then in a triangular formation (C2(ix)), and finally in a single line (saf). 44 The rooster reference term peuleuet manok is correct according to Noerdin Daood (pers. com., March 2003), who believes that several seudati movements are derived from those of roosters and chickens. However, other sy?h say the term should read peuleuet manoe, meaning "gold-trimmed bride" (Mark Durie, pers. com., March 2004).</page><page sequence="35">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 35 In the next example, thum b?d?k ("cannon shot"), the dancers reiterate the popular routine of moving diagonally from two parallel rows (safdua) to one (sa? again. In the last laneui example, entitled gr'um it-it manoe ("bathe (the bride) to the sound of beating and prayer"), the eight dancers vary the single line routine by rotating clockwise on the spot (C2(x)). The final segment of the ph? performance is the closing saleum, in the text of which the dancer-vocalists request the audience's forgiveness for any mistakes and sing farewell as they perform the respectful, closing seumah (or seumbah) movement in a single line.

Formations of the rat?b meuseukat dance (figure C3)45 The dance genre, meuseukat,46 is in my experience usually performed by a group of ten or more women, or sometimes men. Kneeling close together on their heels in a row for bodily support, they perform virtuoso body movements and body percussion while singing in alternation with a pair of aneuk syah? (soloists). They sing religious (or sometimes secular) texts about the birth and life of the Prophet Muhamad and other Muslim themes. This body movement and singing genre is widely believed to have developed spontaneously in western Aceh from the practice of singing songs of praise and performing body movement after Isya prayers (observed daily at about 7.30 P.M.), within or outside a religious teacher's 45 Based on Isjkarim et al. (1980-81:191-94). 46 The name meuseukat may derive from seukat (Ar.), "to pray" (Isjkarim et al. 1980? 81:114). It could also derive from the Acehnese word meuseuh, "to move while seated" (Bakar et al. 2001:857). According to Bakar et al. (2001:602), it may derive from the name of the town Muscat on the coast of Oman.</page><page sequence="38">38 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC home, and to have begun centuries ago to spread the knowledge of Islam throughout Aceh. It was then adapted for entertainment and moral sustenance at weddings and other celebrations (Isjkarim et al. 1980-81:114). The group body percussion includes breast or front of shoulder and thigh beating, clapping, and finger snapping. Each group participant weaves identical patterns in the air with the hands, repeatedly raises and bends the torso or shoulders, and performs neck and head movements. In its formations and costumes, it resembles the ph? dance, but its basic formation is a single saf which is drawn below (C3) for structural comparison with other performances that have been mentioned. aneuksyah? ?\ dancers oooooooooooo Figure C3. Rat?b meuseukat (*sy?h, **ap?t). Often pairs of performers create "border pattern"-like movements: for example, each odd-numbered performer moves forwards while each even-numbered performer moves backwards in continuous motion for a period of time. Formations in the frame drum playing genres As noted above, some typical floor plans for dancer-musicians are also used in performances by musician-dancers who play frame drums while performing concerted body movements in alternation with body percussion episodes and the singing of religious or secular texts. These four frame drum genres?rapa'i Pas?, rapa 'i dab?h, rapa 'i geurimpheng, and rapa 'ipulot?are frequently performed in competitions between two or more sides. Rows of players usually line up opposite each other in one or more rows in turn in competitions. After all the groups have performed, the judges announce the winning team, influenced by criteria such as the compactness of group sound produced, musical and choreographic quality, the lead singer's poetic invention and melodic ornamentation, and the costumes worn, as well as audience acclaim. Rapa'i Pas? performances alternate between bouts of thunderous sounding drumming and the singing of secular or religious song texts. In competitive performances, the heavy long wooden frames from which the great rapa 'i are suspended are placed in, say, three or four diagonal lines on each side of a competition organiser (kali rapa 'i) standing in the middle. A player stands behind each rapa 'i, with another man standing alongside it to steady its swing after it is beaten. This layout is based on the central-point-in-a-circle concept of space, enclosing one or more geometric formations, each consisting of two pairs of three parallel lines arranged at 90 degree diagonal directions in an open, conceptually circular space, with the kali rapa 'i stationed at the central point (see diagram 3).</page><page sequence="39">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 39 Diagram 3. Layout of a r?pai Pas? competition in an open space. The formations of the all-male participants in the secular rapa'i geurimpheng and rapa'ipulot genres are basically linear, somewhat resembling those of rat?b meuseukat. The players kneel either in a single line or a set of two or three parallel lines (see D(ii) and D(iii) below). However, the highly religious rapa'i dab?h, with its Rifa'iyyah47 Sufi-Muslim connotations, is appropriately based on the circular-and-middle-point Acehnese-Perso-Arabic concept of space (see D(i)). As in the dances, the solo vocal role in each rapa 7 genre is assumed by a pair of vocal soloists (aneuk syah?)?or, in dab?h, by one or two kalipah (lit., "caliph")?who sing standard verbal formulae and freshly improvised poetic texts and lead the group singing. Rapa 7 dab?h musicians traditionally sit cross-legged on the ground out of-doors on each side of the sy?h in a circular formation, each playing his medium-large frame drum held on his lap or placed vertically on the ground or floor in front of him, as befits this most strongly Muslim form o? rapa'i playing. (If performing on a stage, they form a half-circle, but this is a recent practice.) The religious leader (kalipah) and his assistant or co-equal leader usually stand or sit on one side to control certain religiously inspired specialist performers or onlookers as they enter into a trance-like state of religious concentration or invulnerability, during which they may stab themselves with a dab?h (from the Arabic dabbus) awl or dagger, or perform other feats, such as placing white-hot 47 Rifai 'yyah is the Arabic name of a Sufi fraternity that probably derives (like the name of the Acehnese frame drum rapa'i) from the name of the great saint Syeh Ahmed Rifa'i (died 1182). The brotherhood was strong in Aceh in the early to late second millennium and traces of it remain to this day (Kartomi 2004:54).</page><page sequence="40">40 2004 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC chains on their necks, with no apparent consequences or pain felt, in the belief that they are protected by Allah. Participants in the Sufi-influenced dab?h genre aim mainly to demonstrate their religious concentration and achieve a feeling of closeness to God by repeating, for hours on end, the names of Allah and the relevant Prophets, especially Muhamad, Ibrahim, and Sulaiman. The religious names or texts that are constantly repeated, chanted, or sung solo and in chorus are intended for the edification of any listeners as well as the participants. I have seen competitive performances featuring sixty men on each side.48 In certain exciting parts of a competitive session between two dab?h groups, the performers on one side aim to confuse and musically "defeat" the other by destroying its established repetitive frame drum rhythms. The side that survives the disruptive rhythms is the winner. In the secular rapa 'i geurimpheng and rapa 'ipulot genres, as mentioned above, players of these smaller and thinner frame drums, led by the sy?h and his assistant the aneuk sy?h, usually begin by forming a single line and then adopt other formations. The basic formation of a group of rapa'i geurimpheng players is as shown in D(ii). Besides playing their frame drums, they also perform body movements and body percussion, and sing in response to the singing of their aneuk syah?. After placing their instruments on the ground or floor, the musicians divide into pairs or threesomes to perform alternating movements, such as weaving patterns in the air with their hands. In rapa 'i geurimpheng performances, the players are sometimes joined by a group of dancers, who perform in the geometric formations discussed above, including the separate row, pair of parallel rows, the circle, the figure of eight, and the concentric rectangular shape. As a special feature of a rapa 'i pulot performance, a group of acrobats may be added to the group of player-singers. The acrobats aim further to amuse and entertain their audience with their physical and verbal feats, forming a linear formation in parallel to the musicians (D(iii)). In some cases there is an odd number of players, with between three and seven acrobats; but the total number is flexible, with twenty, thirty, or even more in a group, often playing in competition with another group. After the musicians play the frame drums for a while, the acrobats perform feats such as walking along their shoulders or outstretched hands, then jump up in the air to create upright-triangular formations, called salikih. Each type of vertical formation is distinguished by a number: salikih 1, salikih 2, salikih 3, etc. (Ali Akbar, pers. com., 2003). The acrobats stand on the shoulders of their colleagues who are standing at the lower level or levels. In such cases, some men may jump up to create a vertical triangular formation of three, or even up to five, rows, with the lowest row of up to seven men supporting a row of, say, five men standing on their shoulders, three men standing on theirs, and one at the top, thus presenting a 48 For a detailed description of a 1982 dab?h (also spelled daboih) performance in Lhokseumawe, see Kartomi (1991:529-38), and for a 1972 performance in Minangkabau, see Kartomi (1991:33-52).</page><page sequence="41">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 41 formation that stretches high into the air. Formations of rapa 'i pulot musicians are a little more complex than those of the other frame drum genres; they mainly comprise linear and parallel linear shapes plus vertical triangular shapes up in the air above the main row of musicians. Unlike the still more complex dance formations, however, all the rapa 7-playing genres have formations conceived either on the basis of a linear-geometrical concept of space or the central-point in-a-circle concept.** Figure D.

This concept, which probably dates back to the pre D?ng-son era (before c. 300 B.C.E.), is expressed in the straight line, parallel straight lines, parallelograms, diamonds, concentric designs, and curved lines, with the latter including figures of eight, ovals, and leaf and flower shapes. These geometric shapes, mostly conceived in relation to an ideal of symmetry, are found in floor plans of such genres as seudati, rapa 7 geurimpheng, and rapa 7 pulot, and in the traditional and modern visual arts. The parallel circular rills carved around the body of a rapa 7 Pas? produce a visual-ornamental effect, but also enable the player to produce a richer sound. The upstrearn-downstream directional concept, governed by the centuries-old tendency to travel upstream for raw materials and downstream for trade, connects upstream spaces to an inward-looking, mystical attitude associated with Animism and Hindu-Buddhism and downstream spaces to an outward-looking attitude and commercial success. This ancient division resulted in the expression of distinctive preferences in artistic design in the upstream as opposed to the downstream performing and visual arts. Thus, upstream people tend to sing and play quieter, softer, more introspective music than do downstream residents, who favour high-pitched, louder, and more extroverted music. The division also influences the traditional ways of making the arts and crafts. For example, when making a great frame drum (rapa 7 Pas?), mystically inclined craftsmen travel upstream to request the nature spirits' permission to fell a selected tree in an environmentally respectful way, then make their mystically powerful instruments as ancestral-venerating objects in workshops downstream. The spatial concept that is based on the central-point-in-a-circle idea is seen by many Acehnese as having a parallel in Perso-Arabic thinking. The idea of arranging circular or concentric-circular shapes around a central point in Acehnese dance formations or visual art designs, and of building towns around a centrally situated mosque, points to Persian, Moghul, Turkish, Arabic, and other Muslim historical linkages with Aceh over the past millennium. These trade and religious-based historical links deepened in importance over the centuries as pilgrims visited the Holy Land and surrounding countries. Thus, a circular formation?whether created by ph? artists dancing around their leader at the central point, by seudati dancers standing around their sy?h in the opening bak saman section, or rapa'i dab?h players seated around a religious devotee? constitutes an important feature of Acehnese dance and music formation design. Finally, the cardinal directional concept of space is related to the upstream-downstream concept, since rivers in Aceh mainly run between north and south. Linked to Animist-Hindu-Buddhist cosmology, the directional grid is still associated with the basic colours used in the visual arts and crafts, costumes, and performance arena decoration. These colours are white (which is associated</page><page sequence="43">KARTOMI ACEH CONCEPTS OF SPACE 43 with east and the metal silver), red (which is associated with south and a copper gold alloy), yellow (which is associated with west and the metal gold), black (which is associated with north and the metal iron), and a mixture of colours (which is associated with the centre point and a four-metal alloy). As the above study aimed to show, parallels between the Acehnese performing and visual arts lie in their application of the principle of freedom versus form, a principle that is widely used, of course, in artistic genres found in many societies, but with particularities of style in each instance. In Acehnese performances of dance and music, a degree of spontaneous creativity is expected of the lead singer and dancer in contrast to the disciplined compactness and cyclic structural redundancy of the group, just as the artistic creator of a visual artwork invents an original new design within the allowable stylistic limits while choosing also to use some cyclically repetitive border designs and other established patterns. Thus, the lead singer and/or dancer in a group are relatively free to improvise and design variations in the formations practised by their group of followers, whose corresponding role, however, is to perform recurrent patterns in a highly disciplined and compact way, albeit often with virtuosity and building up to a breathtakingly fast tempo at the end of a section of performance. Applications of the linear and concentric geometric concept of space, the central-point-in-circle concept and the colour associations of the cardinal directions grid in the formations of performing artists resemble those used in designs produced by visual artists. Creative invention, free ornamentation, symmetry, and cyclic redundancy are also qualities of the melodies and texts sung by artists in their formations in a performance arena. In both traditional and contemporary practice, a remarkable unity of thought and practice is expressed in Acehnese artists' applications of the concepts of space in many of their music, dance, and visual arts designs.

The tsunamis wreaked devastation right around the Indian Ocean, but Aceh was closest to the epicentre, and suffered an enormous loss of life, with utter misery in store for those who survived. This article is dedicated to the people of all walks of life in Aceh in their great suffering, including the artists about whom I have had the honour to write.</page></plain_text>
