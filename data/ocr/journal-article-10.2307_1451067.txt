<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW JANUARY, 1906 THE KARAITE LITERARY OPPONENTS OF SAADIAH GAON IN THE TENTH CENTURY. THE literary campaign that Saadiah, first among the Rabbanites, started against the Karaites, and whose exter- nal history I have attempted to trace in this REVIEW1, found the foe ready to join battle. There arose a complete array of Karaite scholars, who, either in special writings, or incidentally in the course of their works, repelled the attacks of Saadiah with energy. But they were not content to remain on the defensive. They speedily assumed an offensive attitude, and endeavoured, with varying degrees of success, to overthrow the arguments and proofs advanced by Saadiah in support of the Oral Law. A disagreeable element in the campaign is the personal abuse into which the controversy often degene- rated: objective treatises are marred by regrettable recrimination. It must, however, be admitted that in this respect both parties sinned, although perhaps the Karaites sinned the more deeply. The controversy initiated by Saadiah's activity did not cease with his death. It was not confined to the Gaon alone, but drew within its range the whole of Rabbinism. Henceforth polemics form a principal feature of Karaite 1 J. Q. R., X, 238-76. For Addenda and Corrigenda to that essay see end of the present series of articles. VOL. XVIII. P</page><page sequence="2">2IO THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW literature: they inspire Karaism with fresh life, and stimulate the development of its literature in a very great measure. In truth, the polemical element existed in the very nature of Karaism. The latter was a product of opposition and revolt against the principles of Rabbinism, and hence its progress depended upon strife. Personal attacks were not unknown even in its very early days, for 'Anan is said to have prescribed the reading on every New Moon of Psalm lxxiv, because, in his opinion, there was an allusion, especially in verses 4 and 8, against the Rabba- nites 1. Still, polemics play a very small part in the oldest writings of the Karaites, which, by the way, are still accessible only to a very small extent. It was not till the advent of Saadiah that their polemics assumed a tone of bitterness and occupied the most prominent place in their literary activity, and in the centre of the controversial medley was the figure of the Gaon. I now propose giving a bibliographical survey of this literature down to modern times. In the first place, it must be observed that the practice of the Karaites to repeat one another consciously, and often to copy one another verbally, is pursued to a still greater degree in their polemical treatises. The controversy carried on against the Rabbanites in general and against Saadiah in particular was for them a necessary of life, upon which they continuously drew as their main resource. Hence, even at a time when all spiritual life in their midst had been stifled, they still roused themselves, and brought forth their rusty weapons to attack the execrated Fayumite. A brief survey of the earliest Karaite controversy directed against Saadiah is given by Sahl b. Masliah in his polemical work nro nnln 2. We there read: zno iWK nsonni,,, 1 Another statement of 'Anan, reported by Moses Taku, most probably belongs to the realm of legend. 'Anan is said to have wished that he could contain within himself all the learned Rabbis, so that by a single stroke of the sword he might be able to slay them all with himself. See B. E.

But one work fell into the hands of Ben Mashiah, and he replied to it during Saadiah's lifetime. Similarly Salmon b. Jeroham wrote against him in Hebrew and refuted his statement, beginning with the words 'inK1 4WD NWK 1. But not until the death of Saadiah did his writings fall into the hands of the Karaites in various places, and give rise to a multitude of convincing arguments in a number of works. Among the authors of the latter were Abu-l-Tajjib, known as al-Jebeli, 'Ali b. Hasan, Ben Mashiah, Ben Jeroham, known as Ibn Ruheim, Abu 'Ali Hlasan al-Basri, and others. I also have written a reply against his contentions," &amp;c. But this list is not complete. We miss, for example, of Saadiah's contemporaries, so important a writer as Qir- qisani; and even granting that Sahl mentions only those who composed special polemical treatises against the Gaon, we still miss Isaac b. 'Ali, &amp;c. But what sense is there in the assertion that Saadiah throughout his life did not publish his polemical writings against the Karaites? He did not compose them for purely literary purposes, but wished by their means to counteract the increasing propa- ganda of the Karaites. Hence, had he suppressed his writings his intention would have been quite frustrated.

His order, too, I would rather not follow, but propose to give in chronological sequence all the Karaite literary opponents of Saadiah known to me, including also those who only indulged in occasional controversy against him. In any case, this sequence cannot be quite exact, inasmuch as there are no data respecting the lives of many Karaite authors, or the data extant are much confused and mutually contradictory, or, finally, they are fabricated intentionally. In order to make this survey clear, therefore, I shall enumerate these authors according to the centuries in which they lived. TENTH CENTURY. 1. Ben Zuta (or Zita). This otherwise little known Karaite, whose full name was Abu-l-Surri 1 b. Z., probably lived in Egypt, and disputed with Saadiah only by word of mouth, so that, strictly speaking, he does not belong to the literary opponents. If he did live in Egypt, he must have disputed with Saadiah whilst the latter was still very young. The substance of his polemical utterances, which are only known from references in Ibn Ezra, has already been fully dealt with in my Miscellen iiber Saadja, II2, to which the reader may be referred. 2. Ibn S&amp;qaweihi (or SaqOje), one of the oldest Karaite authors, about whose personality we likewise know no- thing 3. He composed an anti-rabbinical work bearing the title nrmsm :sn:, " Book of Shameful Things " (i. e. of the Rabbanites), which consisted of the following ten sections: 1 As Steinschneider rightly remarks (Z.f.

This work was preceded, by way of introduc- tion, by a polemic against the Mishna, in which it was shown that the latter cannot be of divine origin. Ibn S&amp;qaweihi maintained therein, with regard to the subject- matter of the first four chapters, that the later Rabbis had erred in equal measure with the earlier ones; and with regard to the remaining six chapters, he was of opinion that here the later Rabbis had deviated from the earlier ones, and he sought to confirm this by proofs from the Talmud. The work of Ibn SQqaweihi thus comprised the entire scope of the controversy between Rabbanites and Karaites, dealing both with theological matters (anthropomorphism) as well as with matters of Halakha (Sabbath and festival laws, calendar science, and laws of diet, marriage, and cleanliness); and we should have had before us not a mere reply but an independent anti-rabbinical work (the oldest of its kind)2. It is probable, however, that this work was the result of Saadiah's activity, so that it rightly belongs to the category of works dealt with in this study. This section must be the source of Ibn SAqaweihi's opinion, quoted by Moses ibn Ezra in his i-ipnS ;niSo, that 'n- in Ps. lxxxiii. 2 does not mean "to be silent" but ' to be similar" (quoted by Harkavy in his Notes to the Russian translation of Graetz, vol.

Moses ibn Ezra (see Harkavy, ibid., p. c, and Cnt c D 'win, VII, 33) places him in the same rank with Hivi al-Balkhi.</page><page sequence="6">214 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Express testimony to this effect is given by al-Hiti, who was intimately acquainted with Ibn S&amp;qaweihi's work, in the following wordsl: yPi r;mln si-i n t R irpD pr jSBpnSl tnNi1 n4ib tr 2^r^I )nj 4 an.pj 5n:31. This is the conclusion also to be derived from the fact that Saadiah, in his polemical work (about to be mentioned) against Ibn S&amp;qaweihi, already alludes to his principal work against the Karaites, the trn~s aSn 3. It is, therefore, probable that Ibn Sgqaweihi also had before him many polemical writings of Saadiah4, which now provoked him to a counter-attack. Of this polemical work of Saadiah, which bore the title h,pNO jlN '( 5 5 :nb, and of which only a few single quotations were known hitherto s, some extensive fragments have now been discovered. One of these, belonging to the early part6, contains the information about Ibn S&amp;qaweihi's work given above, as well as a part of the refutation of the first chapter, namely, the reproach that the Talmudists anthropomorphized the Deity7.

It is thus established anew that the controversial work against Ibn Saqaweihi formed a separate work of Saadiah, and that therefore the correction is necessary in the words of Moses ibn Ezra: In 5"' I jwn nt11'p1 n ,'tpDo n1, 2 l lrnln [] irnnn EDor ; resp.

The refutation of the eighth chapter (on forbidden degrees of relationship) was thus not included in the work2, probably because Saadiah composed a separate treatise on this subject3. Still another frag- ment4, in which the objections against the Mishna are refiuted, is perhaps likewise an offshoot of the work against Ibn Saqaweihi, as the latter (as we saw above) attacked the Mishna in his own polemical writing, and Saadiah expressly states that he will follow up the refutation of the first four chapters with a defence of the Mishna 5. In this fragment Saadiah does not address his words to a particular person, as in the other two, but speaks of "those people "X.

Harkavy, indeed, conjectures 1 that the quotations firom Saadiah found in Jehuda b. Barzilai's Jesira com- mentary, are taken from a work directed against Qirqis&amp;ni. But it is much more probable that Jehuda b. Barzilai had before him the polemical work against Ibn S&amp;qaweihi2, especially as only one of the Agadot, but not the second 3, defended by Saadiah, is cited by Qirqis&amp;ni. Moreover, it cannot yet be proved that Saadiah may have known the writings of his younger Karaite contemporary. On the other hand, Qirqisani often quotes Saadiah and controverts him 4; but unfortunately only a single long passage 6 from the " Book of Beds" and a few chapters from the " Book of Lights" have hitherto been published. Still, I shall adduce here all the passages known to me. The Pentateuch commentary exists in a longer and a shorter version, and there are fragments of both in St. Petersburg and in the British Museum. In the pub- lished passage from the longer version, which deals with chronology, there is an anonymous rejoinder to Saadiah. After stating that the Bible in dealing with large numbers of years often omits smaller ones, e. g. one or two years, the writer concludes: Wl in fin nizy5 n n : n ail fi,n5 min i, birnN pD I 5y tnj4 cnI5 p5 51 'iN i= p nri "From all this may be inferred the futility of the 'Ibbur (i. e. of the permanent calendar) and the confusion of the one who has maintained that the calendar is very ancient, and that its rules have remained the same since the creation 5nin55 r0 o n3D ,' 15i pnl1 nnmvwc n3Di rinmR ,i pnn, n5 f3D o1t.

As is well known, this was the theory of Saadiah. In the Kitdb al'Anwdr, of which I possess several excerpts in manuscript besides those printed, there are a few chapters exclusively devoted to the refutation of Saadiah, e. g. section xi, chap. 29, on forbidden degrees of relationship, and section xii, chaps. I5-i6, on the use of the fat tail (,1v)1. Again, in other passages Saadiah is con- troverted incidentally (often anonymously), or he is the chief object of controversy: e.g. section ii, chap. 13, on Saadiah's theory about the age of the permanent calendar 2; ibid., chaps. I4-15 (partly edited in Z.f.H.B., III, 175), on the divinity and the necessity of the oral law; section xi, chap. 30 (edited in the Kaufmann-Gedenkbuch, p. I82; reprint, p. xiv), on the prohibition to marry a niece; section xii, chap. 7, on the wrenching off of a fowl's head (npD3) 3; ibid., chap. Io, on the eating of dead fish (Saadiah's name is not mentioned here, cf. Z.f. H.B., IV, 74); ib., chaps. 2o-I (edited loc. cit., p. 184; reprint, p. xvi) on the use of an embryo, &amp;c. Similarly, according to Harkavy, Saadiah and his polemical work against 'Anan are meant in the following passage of the Kitdb al-'Anwdr, the section and chapter of which cannot be ascertained for the present4: n5jnns tn ,pItSK t6 bt bD 1 N' ;w1 j 1y1=-i innl i fY- tC rpI ji5, i.e. "A Rabbanite has refuted the view that the prayers are to consist only of psalms," &amp;c. As a matter of fact, this was a prescription of 'Anan, who endeavoured by this means to annul the hitherto prevalent order of prayer, because the latter went back upon tradition 5. 1 See the headings of these chapters in Steinschneider-Festschrift, pp. 2or, 203. 3 J.

Mus. MS., Or.2525, Catalogue II, no. 588, cf. Steinschneideir- Festschrift, p. 2 i), containing many controversial rejoinders to Saadiah, which had not yet been discovered in the main work: e.g. on the science of the calendar, where Saadiah's name is not expressly mentioned (fol. 44 a, seqq.; see J.Q.R., VIII, 686); on incest (fol. IoI b, similar to section xi, chap. 29, of the main work; the passage may perhaps be taken from Saadiah's treatise on this subject, see above, p. 214); on the idea of I,n fL4 (fol. I37 b; cf. Z.f. H. B., IV, i7 seq.), &amp;c. We thus see that Qirqishni also touches on all the points of difference between Rabbanites and Karaites. It must be observed, moreover, that of all the older Karaite authors Qirqis&amp;ni is most deeply versed in the Talmudic literature, and that his polemics are calm in tone and objective in character. [4. Menahem b. Michael b. Joseph is the author of a poem with commentary on the laws of slaughtering , in which a controversy is directed quite clearly against a Rabbanite opponent. The superscription of this poem reads: 'i ' nn DpI KP bnnp 1:r nMww mninn nrt n,mnw nHn nrnw $I p:in ?nTr D. Pinsker identifies the latter with Saadiah Gaon, makes Menahem his contemporary, and maintains that Menahem indulged in polemics against the also Harkavy, Stud. u. Mitt., VIII, I, 203). In another passage Qirqisani reproaches the Rabbanites for not taking prayers [exclusively?] from the Psalms (sect. I, chap. 3; ed.

A sectarian, Malik al-Ramli, prescribed that Ps. xxix should take the place of the Eighteen Benedic- tions, probably in agreement with the dictum of Hillel, the son of Samuel b.

But this identification can hardly be considered correct, because the language of Menahem points clearly to a Byzantine Karaite, e.g. ~1m for "definition" (p. 59, 1. 7), rip in the sense of "i. e." (= Arab. j^..; ibid., 1. 28), expressions that the ancient Karaites in the East do not know. Consequently our poem cannot have been directed against Saadiah. Menahem belongs to a much later time, and is adduced here only for the purpose of showing that he does not belong to the category of the Karaite authors dealt with here by us. The lifetime of Menahem can, in any case, be determined with a certain probability. On the one hand, he is doubtless identical with the Karaite liturgical poet, Menahem b. Michael, of whose writings we possess (among others) a Zion Ode 2, so that he could not have composed any poetry before Jehuda Halevi. On the other hand, he is already cited by Aaron b. Joseph in the Mibhar (composed I294) on Gen. xxvii. 3 (ed. fol. 50 b). We shall therefore not go wrong if we assume that he flourished somewhere in the second half of the twelfth century. For other proofs of a later date, see Geiger (nrm niK, IV, 3i) and Schorr (ytinn, VI, 76).] It is thus established that only three Karaites disputed with Saadiah during his lifetime. The other two, who, according to Sahl, likewise refuted the Fayumite during his life, certainly developed their main literary activity after the demise of the Gaon. This is also true of 5. Salmon b. Jeroham (Arab. SulejmAn b. Ruheim), about the circumstances of whose life we possess hardly 1 It is superfluous to enter into the other identifications of Pinsker (such as that of Menahem b.

His Hebrew polemical work against Saadiah, written in wretched rhymes, is the only one that has been preserved from remote times, and this has been only partly edited. It was possibly composed while Saadiah was yet alive, about 940. I have already analysed its contents thoroughly in another connexion, and referred there especially to its snarling tone2. Salmon wanted to render this work into Arabic too for the people, but we do not know whether this was carried out. In any case no Arabic version has been preserved. Besides this polemical work Salmon also composed a series of Biblical commentaries, which were probably all issued in the sixth decade of the tenth century (i.e. after Saadiah's death), and which have been preserved partly in the original Arabic, partly in a Hebrew transla- tion. Here, too, aggressive war is waged against Saadiah 3, especially in the Commentary on Psalms (MS. in St. Peters- burg). Salmon speaks here of Saadiah as of a com- pletely unknown man (Dna bKN q'r vr K: y ,y . rD mnsw), and refutes his view that the Psalms might be recited as prayers only in the Temple and only with musical accompaniment4. Then he also controverts another view of Saadiah, that entire psalms are prophecies of David, and that the royal minstrel had assigned many of them to the sons of Moses and to other Levites, to be sung5. See in particular Steinschneider, loc. cit., ? 40 (also ibid., p. 340). J J. Q. , VIII, 684 seq. I have since published many more passages from it, thus ibid., X, 271; Z.f. H.

It is not difficult to see that Saadiah with this assertion aimed at an ordinance of 'Anan. See above, note 5, p. 218. 5 Ibid., p. I9. According to Saadiah, e. g., the heading ntnS in Ps. xc means as much as rran :a1 (he points to Judges i. 3, where mni;r and ptln likewise stand for nrri ':3 and tmIw :a), the heading rnmw, in Ps. lxxii,</page><page sequence="14">222 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW On Psalm cii, 14 there is a rather long excursus on the reckoning of the year of redemption, where likewise a vigorous attack is made on Saadiah. I have edited in full and thoroughly discussed this excursus 1, which Salmon again repeats almost verbally on Canticles ii. I I. On Psalm civ. 19 Salmon quotes his 13S Sy Sv Ss Nn, but it is doubtful whether he means here the Hebrew or the Arabic work2. In connexion with cxl. 6 is related the often discussed fact that Saadiah denied that the Talmud speaks of physical struggles between the followers of Shammai and those of Hillel. This passage has also been thoroughly examined by me 3. In the commentaries on Echa and Kohelet, the only ones that I saw complete in the original Arabic, I found nothing polemical against Saadiah and especially nothing objec- tionable against the Rabbanites, who are elsewhere so violently attacked by Salmon4. Perhaps, therefore, Steinschneider is right in doubting their genuineness5, which has yet, in any case, to be established. Finally, it may be mentioned that, according to Ibn al-Hiti, Salmon died in Aleppo during Saadiah's lifetime. The latter is said to have followed the funeral procession and to have pronounced a eulogy on the departed. All this naturally belongs to the realm of fiction (from mere chronological considerations), but still it is possible that Salmon indeed died in Aleppo . We now know that Saadiah stayed in this town, even before his appointment as Gaon (about 921)7, but at that time Salmon was just a new-born babe. is equal to "on Solomon," &amp;c.

Hasan (or Hi.usein) ben Mashiahl 1, according to the above-cited account of Sahl, wrote polemics against Saadiah both in his lifetime and after his death. He is also said to have tried to hold a dispute with the Gaon verbally, but the latter roughly repulsed him. He succeeded, however, in obtaining one of Saadiah's anti-Karaite writings (which the author is said never to have allowed to leave his possession), and refuted it immediately (in a separate work?) 2. It is, of course, difficult to establish how much truth is contained in this report, but in any case Ben Mashiah ought to be a contemporary of Saadiah, although a considerably younger one. According to Ibn al-Hiti, who often had good information at his disposal, Ben Mashiah, who lived in Bagdad, disputed with his fellow- townsman, the Christian physician, Aba 'Ali 'Isa b. Zar'a. The latter wrote his polemical work against the Jews in the year 387 of the Hegira (=997), and if we assume that this disputation took place before the appearance of this work, that is, about a few years before 997, and that Ben Mashiah was already an old man then, he can hardly have been engaged in literary activity before 940. Hence al-Hiti is quite right in coupling him with Salmon b. Jeroham, as they were of about the same age 3. with Ben Meir, Saadiah says: '1i1 nr gtn m innn nsp 1i Tna x:na i n (Saadyana, ed.

This passage has been preserved in Arabic, in a commentary on Exodus, of which Sahl or perhaps even Ben Mashiah himself is the author, and in Hebrew in a fragment that originates from Hadassi . Besides this, a MS. has been recently published, in which Ben Mashiah reproduces a complete Hebrew treatise on the calendar of an otherwise unknown Rabbanite, Joshua b. 'Aln 2, and which writing perhaps originally formed the constituent part of a polemical work by Ben Mashiah. 7. 'AbtO 'Anftn Isaac b. 'Ali b. Isaac was, according to Ibn al-Hiti, an important Karaite scholar, who in a special work, entitled jisDm: 3nn (2), tilted his controversial pen against Saadiah among others. I have already compiled in another place the little that is known about him, and there shown that he probably flourished about the middle of the tenth century 3. 8. Abu-l-Tajjib al-Jebeli (Hebr. Samuel b. Asher b. Manstr)4 is also mentioned by Sahl among the Karaites who wrote polemical works against Saadiah after his death. According to Ibn al-Hiti, he is said to have been a contem- porary of Abu-l-Faraj Harfn; but as the latter flourished about 0o26, al-Jebeli could not have been cited by Sahl. According to a further account of Ibn al-Hiti, al-Jebeli disputed with the head of a school, Menahem, after he became acquainted with a work of a son of Menahem and died at the beginning of May, Ioo8; see Fihrist, I, 264; II, 121.

If this Menahem, as I conjecture, is identical with another of the same name, who addressed inquiries in Arabic to Saadiah (see Itn, I, 9I)2, then al-Jebeli could likewise have composed his polemical work about the middle of the tenth century. 9. 'Ali b. Hasan (or Husein) likewise figures in Sahl's list among Saadiah's disputants, but there are ho par- ticulars known about him. Pinsker (p. sp) identifies him with the grandfather of Levi b. Jefet, who, in his Muqaddimca (ibid., p. 64, where 'Ali b. tn~S), mentions a commentary on the Pentateuch by him. Accordingly, 'Ali, as he was the father of Jefet, would have flourished about 960-70. But there is a lack of sufficient proof for this, and, besides, the authenticity of the Muqaddimna is not quite free from doubt3. 10. David b. Abraham al-F&amp;si is the author of a com- prehensive and voluminous Hebrew dictionary in Arabic, bearing the title Il;n or m6t6mK ynji nnz. Pinsker and Neubauer have published detailed specimens from it, and placed the author in the second half of the tenth century, soon after Saadiah. On the other hand, there was no lack of attempts, especially on the part of Schorr, to place him in the twelfth century, after Ibn Ezra. But one will have to decide for the first date4. In this lexicon Saadiah is 1 J . Q., IX, 435: 5,iS'r : n yM 1:1R1 ]rvt'SH p 1: wn tR 51nt jw mH$ nDi:?b yIM^M 'D (wltmni=) wiimni tn"wn in?5s (1.

Al-Jebeli's work against the Mahzor-cycle and the calculation of the Molad must be identical with the polemical treatise against Saadiah, as these subjects form the principle theme of polemics. When Ibn al-Hiti says further, that al-Jebeli was of the opinion of Abu 'Ali, i.e. Jefet, one need not yet conclude from this that he followed him, but that their opinions on this point were in agreement. 2 Cf.

In these verses the yielding of fruit-bearing trees only is mentioned, not of ordinary trees (see Nahmanides on the passage). Now Saadiah must have explained ver. I in such a way, that the latter are to be understood by ~ yY, i.e. trees that are a fruit of the earth, as opposed to fruit-bearing trees, which are i nvW. Ver. X1 is shortened, and should also read here E, r'Y [mn~] r;. This explanation of Saadiah, which is combated by David b. Abraham, is, however, in contra- diction to the Gaon's translation of the particular two verses. 11. Abu Sa'id (?) David b. Boaz, the Prince (Do'K, Kwwn), according to a genealogical list of Solomon the Prince (Pinsker, p. 53), was in the fifth generation of descent from 'AnAn. Hence David would have flourished about 9IO (approximately 5x30=I50 years after 'Anan), and have been a contemporary of Saadiah. On the other hand, according to Ibn al-Hiti, David composed his commentary on Kohelet in the year 383 of the Hegira (=993), and was mentioned even after Levi b. Jefet by the Solomon referred to ], so that David would belong to the last quarter of the tenth century. This date seems to me also to be the more correct, principally because David, so far as is yet known, is first quoted by Joseph al-Bastr in the ntylrn - 2. Hadassi also mentions him between Jefet and his son8, though this may be accidental. Of David's works Ibn al-Hiti mentions, besides the commentary on Kohelet, still another on the Pentateuch and a book on the principles of religion (51vbs :rsn:)4. 1 J. .

A. T. W., I, 157), David, in the St. Petersburg MS., frequently controverted Saadiah, not expressly naming him, however, but only designating him as $i'nK smn. In the London MS. there are two such passages (fol. I9 a on xxv. 32 and fol. 3I b on xxvii. 4), and in both the discussion is about the construction of appurtenances of the tabernacle 2 Besides this MS. of the British Museum, Margoliouth has been trying to show that some other MSS. of the same collection also have David as their author, but the demonstration is not everywhere quite convincing 3. We have to consider only two of them here. The one (MS. Or. 24941; Cat. No. 3181) contains a commentary on the first pericope of Leviticus (the beginning and end are missing), and in two passages (if. ib, 4b) there is a hit at the n4SK win. The second is much more important (Or. 2495; Cat. No. 306). This MS., of which I have a copy of a few excerpts, contains a very detailed com- mentary on Lev. xi. I-xv. 25. Of authors mentioned here besides the Talmudists (designated l56ss and lp'tn9) and 'Anan, only Saadiah is very often cited4, sometimes as TS15, sometimes also as ~i4' irn, his name being accompanied by the formula nr?i mfi. The points on which Saadiah's views are combated naturally concern the laws of purity, but they are mostly questions of subordinate 1 See Steinschneider, ? 39 (also ibid., p. 340). 2 See the beginning of both passages in Margoliouth's Catalogue, where Saadiah is referred to in the one as Sji5? l~i, and in the other as 5i-6M win.

J. J., XLI, 306). The commentaries of Jefet, especially that on the Pentateuch, afford very much valuable material for the history of the older Karaite literature and theology; but of the many MSS. extant in St. Petersburg, London, Oxford, Paris, Berlin, &amp;c., unfortunately only a comparatively small portion has been edited . According to Sahl, AbA'Ali HIasan al-Basri, i. e. Jefet, like- wise combated Saadiah in a special work, which is further corroborated by Jefet's own statements. The composition of such a work is promised in the passage on Gen. i. 14. After Jefet advances controversial arguments about the calendar against Saadiah in very thorough fashion2, he adds that he has entered into this dispute only incidentally, because his main purpose is to present here an exposition of Holy Writ. But should God vouchsafe him the time, then he will refute the views of Saadiah in a special treatise (DOwl 4;yn5m nrm &amp;p Nm I:15b iil ~ ,wib ny t 3l . i .. w6-:9 t:n -i 3 n nS Itos =5 lihK m N64D tn in 1- 1m % n5s n-5t5Xx , m ymo rw'5 nm:i nnml nti von5 am no5 hntn5SN Nr 'D Nt onnhNn Nn pnSj N5y snn4 Zrnz ZMZ5N Ni,MS ninn 1y5N D 4 :2N.1 abta 5i No ,iw$ Kn '1lKN N1,114:1 MMK1nS In3 In nn:z ji 0n ,n p lNK ).

I now proceed to give a survey of the passages in question from Jefet's commentaries, so far as I have them before me either in printed form or in manuscript excerpts2.

Contrary to his usual custom, Jefet uses, in the last passage, very harsh words, and says that Saadiah and his party, in maintaining that one must with- out personal investigation follow the representatives of the prophets, that is, the teachers of the Mishna and Talmud, have thereby led Israel into ruin, and so forth 3.

The kindling of fire on the Sabbath, a question likewise often discussed in Karaite polemics. The Karaites, as is well known, not only prohibit the kindling of fire on the Sabbath, but even the continued burning of anything- a severity derived, as I have recently shown (R. E. J., XLIV, i74 seq.), from the expanded meaning of the word ,nron. Jefet often deals with this subject, viz. Exod. iii. 2; xx. 10 (Saadiah is mentioned here only cursorily at the end: ,i n yDKibr n rs iSK nDrnnn zr InnL . . .

This question is notably linked together with the Karaite interpretation of the concept nniyn in3, which deviates essentially from the Rabbinical: see my remarks in R. P. J., XLV, 176 seq. 5. The fixing of the time of Pentecost, i.e. the interpreta- tion of nMwIl nDnD, one of the differences that the Karaites have taken from the Boethusians (see Monatsschrift, XLI, 206, and J.. .R., XVI, 407): Lev. xxiii. 15 (edited by Hirschfeld, Arabic Chrestomathy, p. o09 seq., Jefet's most de- tailed passage on this subject; cf. also J.

Laws of Purity. Of the differences existing between Rabbanites and Karaites on this point, the prescriptions about menstruous women come in specially for considera- tion. There are two points in particular, one concerning the interpretation of lrnn n in Lev. xii. 5, where the Karaites follow the severe view of the Sadducees (see Geiger, Ji%d. Zeitschrift, II, 27; cf. also below), and the other dealing with the determination of the colours in the impure blood of a menstruous woman, which, according to the Talmud, is five-fold (see, e.g., Aaron b. Elia, rly p, fol. IIo a seqq.; cf. also Z.f. . B. IV, o2). Jefet combats Saadiah on the first point, on Lev. xii. 7 (Saadiah says here, among other things, one must, according to Prov. xxii. 28, follow the wise: 51r5 nmn l]i 1:P j 3ii 7pi 1Pi :iml a=n ?K D ntl i5 TnnK vy W nK b1 5o1n m fn is n 5K?4, and this leads Jefet to a short digression on the Oral Law); and on the second point, on Lev. xv. 19. 7. Marriage laws, notably one of the most difficult and complicated chapters in the legal lore of the Karaites, especially in regard to the forbidden degrees of relation- ship. Nevertheless, in his controversy with Saadiah, Jefet mostly touches only subordinate points, which are besides more of an exegetical nature. Thus, on Lev. xviii. 6, con- cerning the expression :W '%Iw (cf. Kaufmann-Gedenkbuch, p. 175; Jefet also considers here the interpretation of Ezra x. 3, on which further below); on xviii. 15, on the ex- pression 1niz, which, according to Saadiah, includes also the son's betrothed, so that the words P3 nvw had to be added here. Much more detailed is the controversy about Levirate marriage, on xviii. I8. Here Jefet follows the opinion of 'An&amp;n, according to which wnn, in Deut. xxv. 5, means not "brethren" but "kindred" (cf. R. . J., XLV, 61 seq.), and among other things very thoroughly refutes Saadiah's proof, that just as the prohibition of Lev. xviii. 16 is limited by the command of Deut. xxv. 5, so also a</page><page sequence="26">234 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW biblical prohibition can be liable to limitation by another command (or, in other words, n"5 nnmi nwv, cf. R. . J., XXXIV, 169), as e.g. the prohibition of Exod. xx. o by the command of Num. xxviii. 91. 8. Civil law: Exod. xxi. 24 (published and discussed in Moratsschrift, XLI, 205), where Jefet upholds the literal interpretation of the jus talionis, and at the same time disputes with Saadiah, without mentioning his name. 9.

D. S. Margoliouth, p. 15I; on the calculation of the year of Redemption, see my Miscellen iUber Saadja, III, 1 = Monatsschrift, XLIV, 410). The tone is mostly calm and agreeable; but the demonstration is not always fortunate. But it must be remembered that the arguments of Saadiah too are very often superficial. The commentaries of Jefet, however, are also in this respect of great importance. Nothing has yet been discovered of Jefet's polemical work against Saadiah, as has already been observed. On the other hand, a work of this kind in Hebrew, directed against a pupil of the Gaon, Jacob b. Samuel, has been preserved'; and I have recently expressed the conjecture, which still needs verification, that this pupil is identical with the Jacob ibn Ephraim mentioned by QirqisLni as his interlocutor (so that his full name must have been Jacob ben Samuel ibn Ephraim) 2. But as the Karaites, and especially Jefet, repeat themselves very often, and inasmuch as par- ticularly in their anti-rabbinical campaign they almost always advance with the same arguments, it is there- fore more than probable that the polemical work against Jacob contains much that Jefet also adduced against German translation: Bacher, Die jiid.

One would therefore be justified in briefly ana- lysing this polemical work, more especially as Saadiah also is expressly mentioned here, in the second poem: btK 1F,n1 nw ,(i.e. from qp in Egypt) ,ramn n,r 1-5 n-nm ;irMM M Kl mvD n:,1 .

This polemical work consists of three sections in doggerel verses of four members, in which, after the manner of the Arabic Muwashshah songs, three members of each strophe rhyme with one another, whilst the fourth members have one common rhyme. The acrostic in all three is alpha- betical 1. That they all three belong together may be in- ferred from the superscription of the third: n"'n 1"5K mt Wv . Possibly these were originally followed by replies in prose. Their contents are as follows:- In the first section Jefet combats the view that there exists an Oral Law revealed by God to Moses, and employs the following four proofs: (I) Moses commands Joshua (Deut. xxxi. I i ) in the presence of all Israel to read the Torah; there is no mention of an Oral Law. (2) To all questions that the son should put to his father, the Torah gives (Exod. xiii. 8, I4 &amp;c.) such answers as can be derived from itself, but not out of any Oral Law existing beside it. (3) Moses, in his last exhortation (Deut. xxxii. 7), enjoins that questions should be asked of the ancestors, the answers to which are contained in the same address: so that here also there is no need of an oral supplement. (4) God promised the scattered members of his people he would turn to them again when they would abandon the work of man (cf. Isa. xxix. i3), among which are to be understood Mishna, Talmud, and Agada, which men invented 2 L The fourth, with the acrostic pin amnnmrn nrpn, belongs, as Geiger, 1. c., rightly recognizes, to Sahl's polemical work. 2 To be sure, we cannot regard this point as an argument against tradition. In the last strophe the first two members must be reversed: rnnn tulin</page><page sequence="29">KARAITE LITERARY OPPONENTS OF SAADIAH GAON 237 In section II the same theme is treated, and two proofs of Jacob b. Samuel for the authenticity of the Oral Law are refuted. From Jer. xvii. 2I, 22 Jacob seems to have urged that the Pentateuchal laws need a supplementary Oral Law, because it does not follow from the Torah that one may not carry a burden on the Sabbath, as the prophet here insists. Jefet replies that this prohibition is to be derived from Num. iv. 13, because here the carrying of a burden is called work (nan%n mnlwS^; and the sons of Kehat had only paits of the tabernacle to carry). The second proof, which Jacob repeated after Saadiah, was that from I Chron. xxiv. 19. Here the words lnwi 'w, which refer to the twenty-four priestly divisions, must necessarily refer to the command of an Oral Law, as there is nothing of it contained in the Written Law. Whereupon Jefet again replies, that Iri 'iwm particularly refers to the service of the priests (hence to Num. xviii. 7); but the twenty-four divisions were indeed first introduced by David . In section III various ordinances and institutions are discussed: on the one hand, it is shown that the data of Scripture for these completely suffice, contrary to the view of the Rabbis; and on the other hand again, that a part of them are not of biblical origin, as the Rabbis maintain, and hence they cannot have any validity whatsoever. For example, the Priestly Blessing2 is expressly enjoined in the Torah (Num. vi. 23); but its details, as in many similar commandments, are to be derived by means of the thirteen I,t, (i.e. the Oral Law) rn*lm ,n,.nnn ,"n,2 pwtn ;: D,n 1,tn ,7 l n~n '7n (i Sam. xii. 2I) non nrn ,w 1ixr k1 1b'm^ 'N :DO ,arlPanb. 1 Saadiah can only have asserted that the priests were already grouped into divisions in the time of Moses, but not into twenty-four, for this number is ascribed to David in the Talmud also (Taanit Babli, 27 a; "Tosefta," IV, 2, ed. Zuckermandel, p. 2I9). Cf. also Commentary on Chronicles, ed. Kirchheim, p. 36 seq.; Hai's "Responsum" in rwnu nrnp, ed. Wertheimer, no. 2o, as well as Maimonides and Nahmanides, "Precepts," no. 26. See also Zunz, Literaturg. d. syn. Poesie, p. 206. 2 This and the following points must, therefore, have been advanced by Jacob as arguments for the necessity of an Oral Law.</page><page sequence="30">238 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Rules of Interpretation (which, as is known, the Karaites also accepted)1. The libation at sacrifices is biblical, but the water-libation is a capricious addition to the words of God (for 2 Sam. xxiii. x6, e. g. has nothing to do with sacrifices), and hence to be avoided. Again, the singing of the Levites belongs to the nature of their service, and had no need to be enjoined; and if at the offering of firstborns a hymn of thanksgiving was sung, a similar hymn with instruments must have accompanied sacrifices.- In Ezra x. 3 the Rabbis refer D1n to the children, that is to say, these were also expelled from Judaism. But this is revolting; the word rather refers only to the mothers 2.- The different b"Ir were devised by the Talmudists, and it was particularly the Rabbis rather than the Karaites (however the latter can determine without an Oral Law what kinds of work are permitted on the Sabbath and what forbidden), who had to ask themselves how it came about that in this law, which claims to be of Divine origin, there should be so many differences of opinion. This last reproach is notably repeated by all Karaite controversialists. 13. Sahl b. Masliah ha-Kohen (Abu 'l-Surri) is one of the most prominent, but also of the most fanatical Karaites of the older period3. He is generally considered very 1 The thirteen Rules are also used by 'Anan and the earliest Karaites, see Steinschneider-Festschrift, p. 2o8. Cf. also Harkavyy Stud.u. Mitt., VIII, i, p. xi. 2 Cf.

The short article on Sahl in the Jewish Encyclopaedia, s. v. (X, 636; by Ochser), is written without any special knowledge of the subject and is not without a comic touch, for Sahl is said to have been one of the Rechabites 1 The Masliah ha-Kohen (Alphab. 47 i), or Masliah Abu '1-Sarri (Alphab. 62 ') quoted twice by Hadassi, was perhaps the son of Sahl also cited by the author of the Hilluk (cf. Pinsker, p. io6, 1. xo; Pinsker, p. 87, n. 2, considers him to be the father of Sahl). On the other hand, the Masliah b. Sahl ha-Kohen and Sahl b. Salah (see J. Q. R., XVII, 632), mentioned in a Pentateuch Codex of the Karaite Synagogue, might have been descendants of our Sahl b. Masliah. These two are brought into connexion with the Massorete, Michael b. Uzziel, who probably lived in the twelfth century (see Steinschneider, Arab. Liter. d. Juden, ? 167).</page><page sequence="31">KARAITE LITERARY OPPONENTS OF SAADIAH GAON 239 much older than Jefet, but the fact was overlooked that in the oft-mentioned list of Saadiah's disputants he also mentions Abu Ali Hasan al-Barri, i. e. Jefet. On the other hand, Aaron b. Joseph, in his commentary on Lev. xv. 25, expressly states that Jefet combats a view of Sahl (fol. 25 a: W1,nD V:1VJ T0 1D: n*,n nbm nyDtp~r 5inD :'an ton :l,. n ... ,,, rar Ki ^ r ms,u FJFDiW D1? ninn: tn nns: nSotw onKi ^inin nwnw W K b6 oi rnn 5y nSoa ji? 1; 1 n1 5#t il, nyii ')I Dn:*i), which indeed occurs in the commentary of the former, although anonymous (see Munk, Notice sur Abou 'l-Walid, p. 6, n. 2). In any case, such anonymous citations are no convincing proofs, for the view-represented by Sahl could be that of a much older Karaite exegete . But another circumstance must be considered. In his pole- mical work (soon to be mentioned) against Jacob b. Samuel, Sahl speaks of letters and various questions which this Jacob addressed to him (see Pinsker, p. 26: 64 nrnr -ly i5/V 'lt:4; and p. 36: n?Kw nmin nrDn wp: tp I w nny nnKi nMy nts vS n w nSbWvmn {?5 s m ., nwM :1^ %= niwn &amp;c.), and as Jacob was a pupil of Saadiah 2, Sahl can have written his work at the latest circa 960. He was thus most probably a contemporary of Jefet, of the same age 3, and wrote about 960-1ooo. In agreement with this are the statements of Ibn al-Hiti that SahI in his commentary on Leviticus controverted Joseph b. Noah, and that he was probably his contemporary, and further, that Levi b. Jefet controverted Sahl in his law-book4. Joseph b. 1 Thus Munk concluded (1. c., p. I5), on the ground of such anonymous quotations, that Jefet is later than Jeshua b. Jehuda. 2 See above, p. 235. s In Karaite literature now Sahl, now Jefet is put forward. See, e. g., Hadassi, 178 D and n, 213 5 and D, 236 n (where 'im trnm), 2 41 , 257 n and i; Aaron b.

That Sahl speaks of the period of Saadiah as of that of his predecessors, agrees with these facts (see Pinsker, p. 36: ,tn,in ,a nlt , , ). Sahl also composed a special controversial work against Saadiah, which he mentions in the same list, and which is likewise lost. But he must have disputed violently with the Gaon in his other works also, of which two, both in Arabic, deserve particular consideration. In the first place, there is a commentary on the Pentateuch, of which a fragment on Deuteronomy is said to exist in a MS. in St. Petersburg (Z. A. T. W., I, I57). The part on Deuteronomy was also used in an anonymous Karaite compilation of the year 1351 (MS. Brit. Mus. Or. 2498, Cat. Margol., I, no. 334, cf. also below No. 38). But another MS. fragment on Exodus, at St. Petersburg, is said to belong perhaps also to Sahl, and here there are two passages against Saadiah. In the one (communicated by Harkavy, Stud. u. Mitt., V, 225) Saadiah's contention, that 'Anan taught that the new month should be fixed by observation of the moon only in order that the Mahommedans (whose custom was the same) should appoint him head of the Jews, is rebutted with great indignation. The reproach is levelled against himself, that in his attempt to succeed to the leadership he relied upon the Mahommedans and desecrated the Sabbath, and that during the strife with David b. Zakkai, his opponents turned to every com- munity with a ban against the man who wanted to attain office in such a manner. In another passage (communi- cated by the same in his edition of Qirqisani, p. 254, n. 4, and Otcherki, I, I1, n. 3) Saadiah's assumption, that the ,; ,iSR mnn inID 'D (ms. ,y) ni Eai ,noCn n2ir5 [nmSi can only refer to Abu Said, i.e. to Levi; see Steinschneider, Z. f.

But I have already expressed the conjecture that the author of this fragment is perhaps Hasan b. Mashiah (see p. 224). A second important work of Sahl was a ni-n imD in Arabic (of which there are fragments in St. Petersburg), with a Hebrew introduction (edited by Harkavy in 9oK lnnn, I, no. I3=y5in, 1879, cols. 639-43), which contains much valuable information about the Jews in Jerusalem in the time of the author (see R. t. J., XLVIII, I54), and is also otherwise very interesting. According to Stein- schneider (Z.f. H.B., VI, I85), this work is perhaps identical with the WNn imD of Sahl cited by Samuel al-MagTibi (Pinsker, p. I44). But it is more probable that Sahl treated ritual and civil law matters in two works, like Benjamin al-Nahawendi before him, of whose nlin:n 'm some fragments have recently become known (collected by Harkavy, Stud. u. Mitt., VIII, i, pp. 75-84), and whose n'In mID on Civil Law is printed under the title (probably invented later) of In=l nNvi. In his law-book also, as a matter of course, Sahl disputed with Saadiah, and per- haps this book is the origin of a passage (communicated by Harkavy in Saadiah's (Euvres, IX, p. xlii) in which the Fayumite is reproached with not recognizing analogy as a legal noun, contrary to the Thirteen Rules instituted by the Talmudists: 'i p nr ri biy nID - 1 (DImi ) ) 51pil ptDvD Kw nir mi 6ll i t9lSi3 M1 nVwionw 31 wn tDil t1 Fe ,n4Sp EN npn y-Si Fe DripJL o PDmb v jx ,1't R ni 'In 53 rna nwnnT )e-6 nviv wn nlnn ni-n ;lnw t6V 1n wn., n-in -I- 1 That Saadiah did not hold the Agada as a standard authority follows also from the above-mentioned fragment of his polemical work against Ibn Saqaweihi (No. 2), where he reproaches the latter with having derived arguments for his assertions not from Mishna, Mekhilta, and Targum, but from Agadot, from unauthenticated writings, and from Piyutim (J.

Moreover, according to a conjecture of Harkavy, Sahl is perhaps the author of an Arabic lampoon against Saadiah, in which is included a similar Hebrew lampoon of one of Saadiah's most ardent opponents, namely, of the Gaon Aaron (orKhalaf, cf. R. P. J., XLIX, 300) ibn Sarjhdo, as well as the libellous document of the deposition of David b. Zakkai (edited as far as extant, and completely discussed last, by Harkavy, Sttud. u. Mitt., V, X22 seq.). In any case Sahl's authorship is very doubtful, for in the first place the pre- viously mentioned fragment on Exodus, which offers some parallels to this lampoon, originates rather from Ben Mashiah than from Sahl; and in the second place, Harkavy himself admits that everything seems to point to the Karaite author of this work having been a contemporary of Saadiah, and having lived in Iraq. But we know that Sahl probably wrote in the last third of the tenth century, and that he sojourned in Jerusalem 2. Besides, as this work is purely personal, and does not touch on any legal or other points of difference between Rabbanites and Karaites, it does not exactly fall within the scope of this dissertation, and it is only mentioned here incidentally. Sahl, like Jefet, composed a polemical work, not only (see Eshkol, ed. Auerbach, II, 47) and Hai (Responsa, ed. Lyck, no. 98), is already found in Saadiah, and was perhaps coined by him. 1 Harkavy wavers between Sahl and Jeshua b. Jehuda, but the author- ship of the first should be more probable: see his polemical work (soon to be mentioned) against Jacob b.

Baruch Jerushalmi (Pinsker, p. 25 seq.) 1. Elias is probably also the author of the title n rir nnrin or nnMrinn Mn . It is written in Hebrew, but Sahl also intended to publish it eventually also in Arabic, so that those ignorant of Hebrew could also read it (p. 25: nrn ipzwna nNK N5KI 4 , 'i31 irrn tip yv 5 W 'V V PFW juD :ips yw t1 rtilT), but we do not know whether he carried out this project. Sahl's work has more the character of a reply, as it was preceded by letters of Jacob to Sahl, both in Hebrew and in Arabic2. In any case the assertion of a controversialist so passionate and relentless as Sahl was, seems rather comical, that he took up his pen against Jacob only because the latter in his polemics indulged in irony and sarcasm (p. 31: s- in r b?t nl n5nn 1r: : ^i n,rlin n6N). The style is lively, but too pathetic and too propagandist3. Here and there one also meets various Arabisms 4. The polemical work in its existing condition is not a uniform composition.

Probably to this poem was attached an epistle, the beginning of which is missing', and in which gram- matical and even orthographical errors of Jacob are pointed out, Sahl remarking that he found nearly sixty such errors in the letters of his opponent {p. 72: mi3p r,i 7!~ T1nr4n nmW nmwv Dbn i). But as a matter of fact, the errors branded by Sahl (where, e.g. 'lznv, nIDD, inp, &amp;c., are written plene) are not errors at all, for this mode of writing was usual in the time of the Geonim in order to facilitate the reading of words without vowels. The actual controversy begins with the words (p. 27): NDy ' n4 s nYni ,nK" W4pm t ~ID ,n , and is addressed to Jacob b. Samuel; but it is really directed principally against the Rabbanites, as it is more in the nature of an admonitory and missionary pamphlet, in which Sahl appeals incessantly to the followers of the Talmud to abandon their former conduct and to walk in the only right way, the way of the Karaites: "'Have mercy, 0 Israelitea," he exclaims in one passage (p. 34), "upon your souls and your children! Behold, the light is burning, and the sun shines forth (i. e. Karaism). Choose for your- selves the good path, where there is living water, and walk hand, in the poem as well as in the epistle and in the actual polemical work, one and the same phrase of Jacob b.

"Brethren!" he exclaims in another passage (p. 43), "hearken not unto those who say that the Karaites (^: npnD) wish you evil. God forbid! Verily we pray unto God, that he should have mercy upon his people, the remnant of Israel, and be mindful of the love for our forefathers. We write all this only out of love for you: circumcise the foreskin of your heart, for the time has come to awake from the sleep of the exile." In a similar strain he goes on reproving the Rabbanites repeatedly for their numerous sins, and accuses them of transgressing many prescriptions of the law respecting diet, purity, marriage, and the Sabbath (pp. 28-30, 32)1, of being devoted to superstition (p. 32)2, &amp;c. And if many of the Rabbanites of Palestine have entered upon a better course, that is due to the influence of the Karaites (p. 33), whose ascetic mode of life Sahl describes in eloquent words (p. 3I). The allegorical allusions of many verses are also interesting, as, e. g. Canticles i. 8 (p. 34), and iii. 7 (p. 36; cf. Geiger, 1. c., p. 24); Zech. xi. 12 (ibid.) and 14 (p. 42). In the last verse he makes the staff by symbolize the empire of the heathen nations, which is styled "grace," because these nations have not destroyed the religion of Israel; by the staff Dn:n is meant the yoke of the two women (Zech. v. 9), i. e. of the two Jeshiboth in Sura and Pumbaditha, which by means of Talmud and Agada " have 1 They are mostly such prescriptions in which the Karaites differ from the Rabb.anites, and are inclined to the severer view; thus, with regard to the enjoyment of an embryo (5t' or 1ntp) and of the fat tail (n), the adoption of a minimum (DQnWv) in the mixing of clean and unclean food, the marrying of a step-sister (:m nt nr) and a childless sister-in-law (nnr), &amp;c.

As can be seen, there is hardly anything of a personal controversy here with Jacob b.

Besides the passage already quoted in this dissertation, where Sahl relates that Saadiah avoided disputing with Karaites, and did not publish his anti-Karaite writings during his lifetime, whereupon there follows a list of the Karaite controversialists (Pinsker, p. 37); it is also related of the Fayumite that in consequence of his persuasive arts2 a dispute about the festivals broke out between the Pales- tineans and the Babylonians, so that they observed the festivals on different days, and hurled the ban against one another. I have shown (J. Q. R., X, 154) that what is meant here is Saadiah's campaign against Ben Meir, in the year 921, which is now pretty well explained, and that Sahl's statements rest upon facts throughout. Much more detailed is a complete excursus in which Saadiah's well-known theory of the great age of the calculation of the calendar is refuted (Pinsker, p. 37,1. 7 from bottom-p. 42, 1. 25)3. Only one of the Gaon's 1 Jefet interprets this word similarly in Cant. iii. a (ed. Barges, p. 4I), although he gives a different allegorical explanation to the entire verse.

The sons of Issachar had, according to Gaon, under- standing of the times (i. e. of the principles of the calendar), and let Israel know when they should " make," i. e. observe, the festivals. The verb nty is also used of the observance of festivals, see Deut. xvi. I, 10, 13. Sahl replies, not without humour, that the sons of Issachar fixed only the time of the paschal offering (for Deut. xvi. I refers only to this), of Pentecost, and of Tabernacles, but not that of the remaining festivals, in connexion with which that verb is not used. On the other hand, they must have taught the order of the festival offerings, the recurrence of the Sabbath, &amp;c., because here lwyn (Num. xxix. 39) and nrwy (Deut. v. 15) are used respectively. In the same way the counsellors of Ahasuerus must have calculated the calendar, because they are called Dnn,l NM1 (Esther i. 13). Finally, Saadiah contradicts himself, as he elsewhere maintains that the fixing of the calendar lay in the hands of the Sanhedrim, and he contradicts the Talmud, which speaks of torches used as signals on the determination of the new month, and of witnesses who were questioned about the new moon, and who, on that account, might desecrate the Sabbath (see Mishna, Rosh ha-Shanah, II) 1. Indeed, Sahl continues, the command for the observation of the calendar follows from Gen. i. 14, Ps. lxxxix. 38 and civ. I9, and calculation is 1 These objections are repeated, partly in the same words, by Jefet and his son Levi, then by Jeshua b. Jehuda and Aaron b. Elias, see above, p. 231.

He says that Saadiah's strange interpretation of the verse in question is not to be wondered at, as he only follows his teachers (i. e. the Talmudists), who have made assertions that are not less comical, e. g. when they deduce the commandment about Kiddush on Sabbath and festivals from Exod. xx. 8 2, or when they order the trumpet to be blown to confound Satan (see Bosh ha-Shanah, i6b supra), &amp;c. Finally, in support of the statement that the Talmudists also speak of an observation of the moon, Sahl (p. 41, 1. 19 seq.) quotes a story that is said to be derived from the Talmud, but which has quite the character of the biblical stories of the Koran. Here also are truth and fiction inter- woven, and the most diverse passages of the Talmud are welded together 3. But it is not impossible that Sahl had 1 That is to say, the calculation of the calendar system is to be regarded as sorcery and astrology.

An anonymous Karaite author, whose work (in Arabic) is partly extant in a St. Petersburg MS., and who (among other things) controverted a passage from Saadiah's Arabic commentary on the 5ln mmo (edited by Harkavy, Stud. u. Mitt., V, 195), must likewise belong to the tenth century. Evidence of his antiquity is afforded by the fact that he quotes nobody but 'An&amp;n, Benjamin al-Naha- wendi, and Saadiah. This Karaite quotes from the work of Saadiah just mentioned, that the compilation of the Mishna began forty years after the restoration of the second Temple and was closed I30 years after its destruction, thus amounting (as the second Temple stood 420 years, accord- ing to tradition) to 51o years ; secondly, that there were eleven generations of Mishna-doctors (see ib. 196, n. IT); and thirdly, that the latter generation fixed the Mishna in writing because they feared, in consequence of the cessation of prophecy and the increasing dispersion, that the tradition might fall into oblivion. The anonymous Karaite replies (see ib. 196, n. 13), that if the Mishna rests on true tradition, why was such a long period necessary for its compilation, whence the many differences of opinion, &amp;c.
