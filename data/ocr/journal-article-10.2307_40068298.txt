Nature's Nation I 1089 Nature's Nation Revisited Elizabeth Hutchinson There are many ways to approach the relationship between humans and the landscape described in two new books by Marguerite Shaffer and Cecilia Tichi, but the interdisciplinary framework of tourism seems most useful. Shaffer s See America First: Tourism and National Identity, 1880- 1940 'is literally linked to this theme, for it charts the transformations in tourism between the comple- tion of the transcontinental railroads and World War II. Tichi's Embodiment of a Nation: Human Form in American Places is not specifically about travel, but the places she examines tend to be ones at which travelers congregate, such as Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone, or, in the case of the moon, spots many dream of visiting. Both books describe how Americans in the past two centuries have used interactions with the landscape to define, explore, and critique notions of national character. As John Sears has argued, the commer- cial and cultural practice of landscape tourism that emerged in the early nine- teenth century was essential to "Americas invention of itself as a culture."1 This connection between travel and the emergence of an American identity reflects the important insights of sociologist Dean MacCannell, who has iden- tified tourism as a model for the formation of modern subjectivity.2 Reversing a several-hundred-year trend denigrating the crassness of the tourist, MacCannell explained that travel allowed people whose daily lives were char- acterized by the disjunctions and alienation of urban industrial life and work to find a comforting unity in the cultures and environments of others. Shaffer and Tichi both attribute to the American landscape the kind of reassurance and artificial wholeness that MacCannell finds essential to the modern tourist s quest. Both authors effectively link their topics with white, middle-class Ameri-</page><page sequence="2">ioqo I American Quarterly cans' attempts to come to terms with an expanding urban-industrial culture. Each author is particularly interested in gender, especially in how engagement with the landscape invited women to question cultural conventions, although both books would have been made richer by reflections on the experiences of members of other marginalized groups. There are important differences be- tween the books, of course, in terms of both subject and approach. See America First focuses on what Shaffer calls "national tourism," a large- scale middle-class phenomenon she distinguishes from the more elite and re- gionally oriented picturesque tourism of the first half of the nineteenth cen- tury. In Shaffer s eyes, national tourism was a "ritual of citizenship" that offered tourists discomforted by the social and cultural disruptions of the time a reas- suring sense of unified national values and aspirations. As she explains, be- cause the development of tourism in this period was so dependent on the government and big business, it provided less an escape from industrial cul- ture than an opportunity to come to terms with it. The book's chapters survey the individuals, groups, and corporations involved in the creation of national tourism. Shaffer also pays attention to the development and expression of the touristic desire through analysis of advertisements, guidebooks, travel writing, and souvenirs. Shaffer points out that it took more than the means of travel to tempt tourists to vacation in the West. Developers needed to devote money and other resources to stimulating their imaginations. In the years following the Civil War, much of the literature about the transcontinental railroads was geared toward settlement and investment. But some railroad owners and local boosters understood that the burgeoning mass media could be used to create a more temporal interest in the West. The Northern Pacific Railroad pioneered this development, producing promotional tourist materials even as it was lay- ing track. In the 1870s, Northern Pacifies backer Jay Cooke hired Nathaniel Pitt Langford to publicize the Yellowstone region, facilitating the creation and dissemination of newspaper and magazine articles by scientists and laypeople and appealing visual images by William Henry Jackson and Thomas Moran. In the following decades, despite periodic economic setbacks, the railroad cre- ated what Shaffer calls a "brand named tourist attraction" out of this "Won- derland" by building hotels and other facilities, codifying sites, and continu- ing to develop guidebooks, pamphlets, and articles. This style of corporate branding served as a model for other railroads' development of tourist desti- nations, notably the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fes resorts in the Southwest and the Great Northern Railway's development of Glacier Park in northern Montana. The railroads saw their interests as consistent with national needs.</page><page sequence="3">Nature's Nation I 1091 Shaffer quotes the president of Great Northern, which used "See America First" as its slogan, stating, "I am in hearty sympathy with [the] 'See America First' movement and with the economic and patriotic ideas that have inspired it. Intimate knowledge of our own country is a first step toward intelligent citizenship" (40). While it appealed to a sense of patriotic duty, American tourism always developed in dialogue with the European travel. As Shaffer explains, the boosters of the American landscape needed to simultaneously distinguish the United States from the Old World and guarantee their visitors the same cultural en- richment and elegant accommodation they would expect on a traditional Grand Tour. This resulted in some odd juxtapositions, such as the simultaneous use of both Native American and Alpine imagery at Glacier. Members of the Blackfeet nation who went to work for the Great Northern as professional "friendly" Indians when their traditional lifeways were disrupted, gave the park an antimodern, anti-industrial, and quintessentially American identity that tourists embraced. At the same time, chalet-style architecture and wait- resses in Swiss folk costume helped assuage any anxiety about the illegitimacy of wilderness tourism by associating it with the Alps. Despite such efforts, American tourism really took off only during the 1910s, when World War I put a temporary halt to European travel. In the years surrounding the Great War, American tourism saw important developments, including the National Park Service Bill of 1916, the promotion of national tourism at the Pacific Exhibitions of 1 9 1 5, and, perhaps most significant for Shaffer's story, the Fed- eral Highway Act of 1912. This latter finally created the means by which tourists could create their own itineraries. As Shaffer explains in her fourth chapter, ideas about citizen- ship played as important a role in the history of highways as they did in the promotion of railroad tourism. Indeed, some of the strongest supporters of the development of roads were patriotic organizations interested in giving trav- elers access to historic sites. Roads themselves could be testaments of Ameri- can values, as supporters of the Lincoln Memorial Highway argued. Shaffer finds a similar mixture of commerce and citizenship in the guidebooks she examines in her fifth chapter. Tracing a development from D. Appleton's na- tional guides (including William Cullen Bryant s Picturesque America or The Land we Live in [1874]), through the Page Company's "See America First" series (published between 1912 and 1931), and the WPA "American Guides" begun in 1935, she demonstrates how they all teach readers how to look at the nations mountains, woods, and rivers. The result is a codification of sites that emphasizes tourism's sense of national coherence and unity. Even the sketches</page><page sequence="4">ioq2 I American Quarterly of local color and accounts of folklore provided by the WPA guides follow a unifying script of settlement, development, and statehood that relates each state to an essential "American" character. Some of the richest parts of Shaffer's book come in the last two chapters, which look at more personal discussions of travel. "Tourist encounters" exam- ines the social commentary offered in road literature produced by Sinclair Lewis, Emily Post, Theodore Dreiser, and others, which criticized the effete values and restrictive gender roles of contemporary urban life. Shaffer reads these antimodernist pieces as a literature of self-realization that helped con- solidate a modern sense of subjectivity constructed through consumption and leisure activities. This writing is not explicitly about citizenship, but ideas of national identity are present in the way the literature reveals the writers' anxi- eties about the ethnic diversity, economic instability, and feelings of power- lessness accompanying modern urban life. As she claims, the authors entered the landscape "not only for pleasure but also to discover or invent an America in which they, as white, native-born, upper- and middle-class citizens... could regain some sense of identity, security, and control" (229). These chapters establish the significance of gender to Shaffer s story. Women figured in earlier chapters, notably in the DAR's support of the Old Trails Road and the prominence of women writers among the authors of promo- tional literature and guidebooks, but their work contributed to an "official" voice of tourism. When she examines the more emotive and private texts of fiction, diaries, and scrapbooks, Shaffer demonstrates that the escape from urban industrial culture offered women a release from the refinement, restraint, and passive sexuality that characterized contemporary ideas of femininity. This is not to suggest that the majority of women tourists were radical. The white, middle-class subjects she describes generally apply their new sense of freedom to cultivating a sense of self that reinscribes the existing social structure. Shaffer moves gracefully between different kinds of evidence. Her range of materials, from corporate reports to fiction to the private jottings and snap- shots found in a tourist's scrapbook, gives a sense of the complexity of tourism even as it reinforces the impression of false coherence that the "See America First" phenomenon engendered. But the success of this book is indebted as much to its theoretical underpinnings as to its archival breadth. She inter- weaves the work of classic American studies scholars with insights drawn from key figures in the theories of travel and modernity such as MacCannell, John Urry, and Susan Stewart. In fact, she could have expanded these analyses with- out overpowering her historical narrative. While See America First convincingly describes a ritual of citizenship for female and male members of elite society, Shaffer, frustratingly, doesn't give</page><page sequence="5">Nature's Nation I 1093 voice to the roles people outside this group played in constructing national tourism. While the corporate exploitation of Blackfeet and others as employ- ees and symbols is mentioned, there is no exploration of how this introduced Natives to the very contradictions of industrial culture the tourists sought to escape. The author recognizes that Chinese emigrants and Mormons also worked at tourist attractions, but doesn't investigate how these and other groups interacted with the myths of citizenship Shaffer describes. As Dona Brown, Chris Wilson, Anthony Lee, and others suggest, members of marginalized groups entered the tourist industry as an attempt to enhance their economic and social status.3 Embodiment of a Nation offers case studies in the anthropomorphism of the American landscape. Building on the work of anthropologist of religion Stewart Guthrie, Cecilia Tichi sees this approach as a powerful and recurring means by which Americans dealt with social change, often by updating and reinscribing hegemonic concepts of "Nature's nation." Of course, there is nothing intrinsi- cally American about anthropomorphism. It exists in many cultures, and the impulse to apply it to the New World, as the author admits, has its roots in the old one. Tichi may be right, however, that, partly because of the forces de- scribed by Shaffer, the impulse to use anthropomorphism to explore questions of national (as opposed to personal, regional, religious, etc.) identity are par- ticularly strong. The differences between these two books can largely be attributed to the authors' disciplinary backgrounds. Shaffer, a historian, has a single narrative throughout. Tichi, a novelist and professor of English, has compiled a series of case studies that range in terms of period, content, and meaning to produce a meditation on a variety of responses to the American landscape. Tichi finds references to the American landscape as a body everywhere - in Frederick Jack- son Turner's description of the "arteries made by geology," in Norman Mailer's characterization of the moon as a "mistress," and in newspaper accounts of Love Canal as a "wound that never heals." Many of her examples of embodi- ment consist in a single word or phrase pulled from a longer text, and the connections between her sources are often tenuous or purely figurative. If this psychoanalytic approach is not always convincing, it is full of fresh materials and provocative insights. The strength of Embodiment of a Nation is the author s openness to seeing a variety of meanings inhering in one site or even, as her reading of Kate Chopin's The Awakening demonstrates, one text. As she writes, "The point of Embodiment of a Nation is.. .to demonstrate the way in which a national paradigm expresses itself in variation, contrariety, statement, and counterresponse" (10). The sources she draws on set us up for contradiction:</page><page sequence="6">1094 I American Quarterly readings of the most canonical works of American thought butt up against articles in People magazine and Disney television specials. As might be ex- pected from an English professor, Tichi is best when she is analyzing a literary text, but her ability to situate these works within a larger and more popular context is essential to her argument. While much of what Tichi analyzes con- tributes to a hegemonic, Anglo-Saxon, patriarchal culture, she cites several figures, especially feminists, who use the language of embodiment to critique mainstream values. The book operates through a series of paired chapters, each of which con- tains an extended case study. The first section, "Crania Americana," includes readings of Mount Rushmore and Walden Pond as the head and the body of the nation. With its carved portraits, Mount Rushmore is Tichi s most literal example of embodiment. Tichi interprets the monument as an endorsement of the constitution of the body politic in the years around its 1 924 commis- sion, which privileged white male corporate "heads" and "brain power" over the brawny, largely immigrant, and nonwhite body of labor. The desire to seek moral and political leadership in the "face" of the land goes back to an older northeastern practice epitomized by the naming of the Presidential range and the Old Man of the Mountain. Excursions into Melville, Hawthorne, and the literature of physiognomy, as well as the anti-immigrant sentiments of the mid-nineteenth century, reinforce her connection of anthropomorphism and nativism. Chapter 2 contrasts the impassive heads of Mount Rushmore with the more communal and even visionary face of nature found at Walden Pond - a site Thoreau referred to as "earth's eye." Here Tichi is less interested in early history than in the counterculture's embrace of the site in the late 1 960s and 1970s. As she explains, environmentalists, hippies, and psychedelic types all described the pond as a place to resist the establishment mentality embodied by carved and sitting presidents. To this largely white and privileged group Tichi adds a symbolic presence of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King, Eldredge Cleaver, and Malcolm X, not because they visited Walden, but be- cause they also criticized white heads of state and business and because King admired Thoreau. The next two sections continue this contrast between anthropomorphic sites that are authoritative, monumental, and masculine and those with more communal, spiritual, and feminine associations. "Frontier Incarnations" com- prises chapters on Yellowstone and the moon. Tichi sees the American explo- ration of both as an imposition of industrial and technological power on the land. Noting the prevalence of both industrial and corporeal images used in early descriptions of Yellowstone, "Pittsburgh at Yellowstone" argues that the</page><page sequence="7">Nature's Nation I 1095 park helped allay anxieties about industrialization. Descriptions diffused a body across this uncanny environment as visitors saw breasts, faces, and other physical features in the heart of the continent. But the hissing and throbbing geysers were also evocative of factories and smokestacks. Tichi argues that the geysers offered the often neurasthenic middle-class tourists a natural (and national) endorsement of cultural change. While irregular geysers fueled fantasies of the earthy irrationality of workers, Old Faithful suggested the possibility of a ra- tional and productive natural order. A hundred years later the dream of ex- pansion and control reappeared in the Apollo program, but here the moon is not a worker's body but a woman's. Weaving between texts by Neil Armstrong, Norman Mailer, Annette Kolodny, and Marge Piercy, Tichi re-creates the hypermasculinity of the cold war era and relates it to the emergence of a body- centered and nature-identified feminism in the early seventies. "Bon Aqua," the last section of the book, looks at two sites associated with femininity and feminism. The first is Hot Springs, Arkansas, a resort frequented by Victorians seeking the "water cure" that reflected tensions over changing definitions of gender. Many associated the spas healing waters with an "Ameri- can Hygeia," a reassuring preindus trial image of nurturing feminine Nature. At the same time, it was a place where the aquatic forces flowing in both the earth and women's bodies were brought under the control of a rational, mas- culine medicine. This conflict plays out in women's writings in the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries. As Tichi shows, some embrace an identi- fication with water while others reflect the contemporary anxiety about its overwhelming power. Tichi counterbalances the positive Hygeia with Love Canal, which she reads as a more negative expression of female nature. The chapter brings together Love Canal housewife-turned-activist Lois Gibbs with the environmentalist Rachel Carson and eco-feminists as women caretakers of an ailing earth. This section, while fascinating, undermines the book's claim that embodiment is a universal strategy, suggesting that it is actually linked to racial, class, educational, and ethnic privileges not all Americans share. Tichi notes that working-class Gibbs does not participate in the elite tradition of personification and she doesn't refer to Love Canal in corporeal terms. (Mem- bers of the media describe Love Canal as "bleeding," a "wound," a "scar," and a "malignant growth," but I'm not convinced these five words mean that "Love canal is.. .first and foremost a body" [227-28]). It is hard not to feel that Gibbs has been coopted. Not every marginalized group frames questions of the hu- man relationship to the landscape in terms of nation or, for that matter, turns to our own landscape to express its critiques.4 1 wonder how an examination of the African American experience at watering holes such as Martha's Vine-</page><page sequence="8">ioo6 I American Quarterly yard, American Beach in Florida, or even Hot Springs (the site of an impor- tant State Baptist Convention in 1884) might have refined the argument even further. But one of the strengths of Embodiment of a Nation is that is encour- ages a reexamination of the exceptionalist point of view the author simulta- neously critiques and extends. As an art historian, I find both authors' extensive engagement of visual culture noteworthy. Tichi's comparison of a postcard of Pittsburgh showing billowing smokestacks with a photograph of Old Faithful erupting is worth more than a thousand words. Shaffer's illustrations bring to life the materiality of the sources she's analyzing, offering glimpses of pamphlets and guidebooks, details of maps, and leaves from albums and scrapbooks. Both writers fre- quently sum up the general sense of an image quickly and elegantly. At the same time, there is a tendency in both books to treat the meaning of images as self-evident. Pictures are generally as full of disunities and contradictions as the other kinds of resources the authors interrogate. The popular imagery they reproduce participates in a visual tradition of landscape representation; it in- vokes and reworks older conventions of the picturesque and the exotic in ways that merit analysis and deconstruction. With the growing number of excellent studies of the visual culture of tourism, I expect to see scholars from a variety of fields becoming increasingly sophisticated in their analysis of illustrations.5 Tourism has become a hot topic in cultural studies. Recent years have marked the emergence of new subfields such as culinary tourism, gay tourism, and the study of attractions associated with disaster. The analysis of both actual and virtual travel has become essential to our understanding of globalization and its impact on personal and national identity. Much of this work has built on MacCannell's interest in the human spectacles created by the tourist industry; recent studies look at human behavior at festivals, theme parks, and tropical resorts.6 Shaffer andTichi remind us that human relationships to one another are frequently worked out through human interactions with the landscape.
