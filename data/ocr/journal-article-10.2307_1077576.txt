<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRAINING FOR POWER H. GLICKSMAN University of Wisconsin The student who can master the daily assignment but who cannot, in review, co-ordinate the work of a semester, or half- semester, into a unified structure, is perennial among the problems of the teacher. "I understand the work from day to day," he complains, "but I am helpless in examinations." The sympathetic, perhaps sentimental, explanation that he is congenitally nervous in the presence of a critical ordeal and that he would produce better results on a written test if only he had a temperament adapted to written tests, has the virtue of leaving the student with a certain superficial solace; but it does not attack the heart of the difficulty. Is it overstating the case to say that the student-certainly the student of college rank-who quakes before the final scholastic reckoning is handicapped not so much by any pernicious or aberrant twist in temperament as by sheer lack of intellectual power ? The question, however, is not associated exclusively with written examinations. Conscientious, alert teachers face it every week. The student who knows that the English Parliament and the Crown bore a certain relation to each other in the fourteenth century and a certain different relation in the fifteenth century but who cannot infer from the two facts, in conjunction with other corresponding facts, that a plain tendency marks the growth of Parliament is, after all, the very student who exclaims, after the final examination, in a "post-mortem" comparison of notes with his fellow-students, that "the class was never asked those questions in a regular quiz period." From the student's restricted point of view, there is some- thing like justice in his resentment. What he fails to understand, however, is this: that any well-drafted examination should be a challenge to the students to display their capacity in the organizing of materials, in the marshaling of a formidable mass of data into 301</page><page sequence="2">302 THE SCHOOL REVIEW [April orderly array, in converting a pile into a file. An adequate exam- ination in any branch should, in a word, be an intelligence test, a test of mental power. Training for power is, indeed, a venerable educational gospel. The stern, old-fashioned curricular offering of Greek, Latin, and mathematics was not always, as it is sometimes supposed to have been, a mere expedient in preparation for passive scholastic careers. Those educators of the old school who were not pedants believed in that diet mainly because it stiffened the intellectual sinews and in the best sense prepared for life. The latter-day predilection for highly specialized training, for immediacy of result in a field charac- terized by special manual or mental technique, seemed, a few years ago, to be menacing the ancient faith in training for power; but the orthodox cause, though it seemed asleep, had by no means perished. Right-minded teachers have not only survived the onslaught of the specializing phase; they have, in fact, been baptized in fire and have come out clarified and insistent, satisfied more intensely than ever before that the essential function in education is to equip the whole boy or girl and not a fragmentary segment labeled with a professional or occupational destination. A thoughtful Freshman at one of the great middle-western universities, after remarking to the writer of this article only a short time ago that the aims in Freshman English and in Freshman history are not, after all, widely different from those in Freshman mathematics, proceeded to declare his intelligent approval. That youth has already discerned the vital thing in his own educational program. His eager mind is lending itself, with energy and hospitality, to the ministrations of teachers who know that sound pedagogic methods will leave their influence long after course-contents have vanished. There is no disposition here to magnify the virtue of power over that of information. It is not, indeed, clear that they are sepa- rable, even for the elastic purpose of academic discussion. Informa- tion has been said to be the handmaid of power; and it is, no doubt, if one happens to care for anthropomorphic analogy, a fairly rational metaphor. In one dictum, however, all teachers, whatever their specialty, should concur: that no teacher can afford to belittle the importance of method, even of method per se.</page><page sequence="3">1923] TRAINING FOR POWER 303 The point needs some elucidation. It probably occurs to almost everyone, in looking back on his own college years, that some of his teachers seemed to dispense their courses in unrelated stages, in successive chaotic doses curiously compounded of facts and items, of names and personalities. Unhappily, there are still teachers, though few, who teach with little or no feeling for what may be called curricular unity. Someone has said that a single recitation should be so conducted that the students derive, from the instructor's process, the same impression that they derive from a more tangible work of art. A recitation should, in other words, be an organic unit, with beginning, middle, and end; with an object clearly designed and the identical object clearly achieved. A whole semester's work should, in like manner, have its central idea, with daily methods and weekly programs incessantly contributing and reinforcing. What is more, the instructor should sacrifice no opportunity to take his charges into his confidence, both imparting the information which comprises the stock in trade of the subject and expounding, nay recommending, the scheme on which he has conceived and developed the curricular schedule. There should, in other words, be no mystery, no sleight of hand, in pedagogic method. If a logical and invulnerable theory has guided the framers of the course, the exposi- tion of the theory is a priceless elixir which no teacher has a right to withhold from the hungry minds of his students. The human soul loves system and symmetry of form; human sense craves harmony in design; human beings respond to self-consistent, purposeful artistry in any intellectual activity or enterprise, whether in the classroom or out of it. To this contention the reply is made that not every subject is inherently adapted to such methodical treatment. In the teaching of history, or literature, or economics, or philosophy, or non- laboratory science, all subjects rich in text materials demanding categorical assortment, the instructor may, it is plain, suggest readily enough some scheme of classification to which the student's imagination may cling as the work progresses. What, however, shall be done, in the interests of method and to the end of enhanced power, in those branches wherein the primary concern is not so much the organization of unassimilated text-material as the application</page><page sequence="4">304 THE SCHOOL REVIEW [April of underlying, permanent principles to a riot of intellectual prob- lems? What, in short, can unity in presentation accomplish in branches like mathematics and laboratory science and language? The answer is that in this wide field there resides, always, a potential invitation to the use of that centralized treatment which, in the other field, the teacher summons only by sporadic and collateral suggestion. It may, conceivably, not occur to the instructor in English literature to induce his students to arrange the literary speci- mens which they have read during a period of several months accord- ing to the continuous literary movements and tendencies manifest on a careful retrospective survey. In mathematics or language, on the other hand, controlling principles are at the student's elbow from first to last, and his success depends in large measure on his ability, endowed or acquired, to recognize the peculiar applicability of a principle (whether theorem, formula, or rule) to an instant case. The value of mathematics as an antecedent to the abstract and elusive science of law is, radically, this: that mathematical training, better than any other, enables the mind to reconcile and distinguish, to separate wheat from chaff, to discern the applicability of principles. The teacher of a legal subject customarily demands, when the student states or "briefs" a case, that he accompany the announcement of the legal proposition with a statement of the facts. The law student's outstanding object, therefore, if he is bent on acquiring the discipline which he will need in his profession, is to establish, in his own mind and in the minds of his instructor and fellow-students, a sound and logical basis for applying a rule to a set of circumstances. Serious contemplation of the language problem suggests a similar comment. A prominent teacher of mathematics has recently said that years of observation convince him of the coincidence between proficiency in mathematics and proficiency in language study. The reason is obvious. Both of these fields postulate the application of principles to phenomena. The student who writes successful English themes is one whose mind, having retained rules of grammar and rhet- oric and mechanical form, can apply them, judiciously and flexibly, to the business of rhetorical structure; the successful teacher of compo- sition is one who, barring irrelevancies, can concentrate on any given exercise the student's acquaintance with rules and doctrines. There</page><page sequence="5">1923] TRAINING FOR POWER 305 is a real temptation, in the teaching of either a domestic or a for- eign language, to borrow the machinery and terminology of natural science and to employ the phrase, "laboratory method"; to inter- relate, and to make one's students interrelate, the peculiarities of various passing combinations with controlling laws. A competent teacher of French or German, if he is himself disciplined in the logi- cal complexities of Latin syntax or in the trying mazes of Greek inflectional variation, enjoins his students to regard a page of the foreign text as a challenge, a challenge to their sureness and readiness in invoking rules of syntax and inflection and in applying them to the visible problem of converting multifarious verbal forms and syntactic constructions into coherent sense expressed in the native idiom. If he inclines with diligence, the student so directed may shortly perceive that, in the affairs of life, the basic intellectual problem is the finding of the right key for the right lock and that selection and application, analysis and synthesis, are indispensable and eternal processes. A qualifying word is now necessary. Training for power is bought at a considerable price, a price measured in terms of the student's zeal and devotion and character. Methods and theories are valuable chiefly in proportion to the teacher's indefatigable insistence on the student's own use of them. Too many instructors are dispensers and demonstrators instead of masters of mental disci- pline. Method, if it is ultimately to prevail in the lives of students, should not descend on their heads like manna from the sky. The tissues of the mind, like those of the body, expand and harden with exercise. Good teachers are agreeing more and more that in the best teaching the class does most of the work. Such is training for power. Fundamental in that type of train- ing, there is, then, the perception of relations and relative values; the knowledge of what we call elementary principles is, in other words, simply a knowledge of the relations in which those principles stand to all of the nooks and angles, all of the outcroppings and ramifica- tions, of the science in hand. When teachers, moreover, speak of strong students and weak students, they virtually imply only one essential distinction. By the strong student they mean that student who, they are assured, can himself discern and appreciate the true relations of the problem before him-and the problem may be one</page><page sequence="6">306 THE SCHOOL REVIEW in humanistic or natural science, or in history or language, no less than in mathematics-to a governing law of the subject, or to some theory of organization revealed or implied in the work of a curricular time-unit. By the weak student they mean that student who, with a memory, at best, for only isolated facts or concepts, fails to dis- cover and appreciate those relations. If these are the strong and the weak students, who, then, is the efficient and sympathetic teacher? It is he who invariably relates the content of his course to what the student already knows and the parts or elements of his subject to some orderly plan identifiable in the mind, or the composite mind, of his specific group, insisting throughout on the cultivation by the student himself of hardy initiative and self- reliance in this paramount task of co-ordination. By the same token, it is he who illustrates in practice his belief in the doctrine that effective teaching is conditioned on contact with the student- mind; who realizes, therefore, that no integer of curricular work is, in a real sense, repeated when it is addressed to a new group of students. It is he, moreover, whose spirit never flags before the prospect of adjusting old methods to the new situation. To that type of teacher, training for power is a mission that lives, for he knows that power is the "pulse of the machine, " and that power is wisdom.</page></plain_text>
