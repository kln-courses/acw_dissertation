World issues, including the state of the ecosphere and biodiver- sity, regularly see political leaders, NGOs, business representatives, religious/spiritual orga- nizations, academics, and others engage in international aviation-dependent meetings to address critical challenges facing humanity and the planet. Yet, climate scientists and advocates call for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 to cap the increase in global temperatures to 2°C. Aviation emissions resulting from international meetings raise questions that are not silenced by GHG emissions offsetting. The era of climate change and 'peak oil' poses ethical challenges for holding international in-person religious and academic events, especially when the events propound an environmentalist concern and when aviation use is assumed. This paper raises questions regarding the ecological impacts of large international events and focuses the 'inconvenient truths' associated with international aviation in the era of global warming. The Parliament of the World's Religions, the largest multifaith gathering in the world, serves as a case study. The paper emphasizes the view that faith-based/faith-inspired organizations have a special responsibility for leadership in policy and praxis on the moral imperatives of sustainability, sustainable development and climate justice.

Introduction - Part 1 Religious1 institutions and their leaders have always been held to a high moral standard. Even in a secularized society, religious leaders' moral authority is sought, and expected. For many of the world's religious popu- lace in particular, faith-based2 institutions serve as beacons of ethical con- duct, inspiring ethical behaviour in their followers. Those in leadership positions are expected to Live the teachings of their respective religion - to not only preach religious truths and associated ethical principles, but to practice what is taught. Traditionally, though perhaps less so in the increas- ingly secularised West, religious institutions, faith-based organizations and their executives are considered community leaders and fora where leadership on ethical issues can be gleaned and moral dilemmas can be debated, and perhaps resolved. Religious leaders' moral leadership, espe- cially when advocating on behalf of the marginalized or when confronting injustice and evil, is valued and rewarded with historical recognition (e.g. the Confessing Church's stand against the holocaust during the Third Reich in Germany) whilst collusion in moral wrongs is met with societal repug- nance and indignation (e.g. the Roman Catholic Church's complicity in and later lukewarm response to the physical and sexual abuse of children in its care). Until very recently, religious ethical leadership on societal issues has been limited to concerns affecting the human community, such as poverty and violence. Over the last three to four decades, such concerns have grown to include ecological3 well-being, more recently in the context of the n We use 'religious' and 'religion' in their conventional sense, pertaining to formalised sys- tems of metaphysical (usually but not always theistic) belief. Whilst we acknowledge impor- tant differences in how 'religious' and 'spiritual' are understood and used, for ease of use we combine these terms and concepts here under the term 'religious' rather than using both terms or the hybrid 'religio-spiritual.' 2) We use 'faith-based organisations' whilst acknowledging that some similar entities can be more accurately referred to as 'faith-inspired organisations.' 3) We use the term 'ecological' rather than 'environmental' to highlight the communitarian 'web-of-life' aspects of the human-Nature relationship and a philosophical position of ecocentrism. The term 'environmental' (from the French, environnement 'around us') argu- ably denotes an anthropocentric orientation that places humans at the apex of a hierarchy of Nature, with other-than-human life considered peripheral. For more on this theme see, for example, Hoffman &amp; Sandelands (2005), Kortenkamp &amp; Moore (2001), Lynn (2004), J. Nash (1991), Nordlund &amp; Garvill (2002) and Scharper (1997). Our use extends to 'ecological ethics' rather than 'environmental ethics,' though we note that both terms are in wide use.</page><page sequence="3">A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-195 181 inequitable impacts of anthropogenic global climate change (herein 'cli- mate change') on humans and non-human Nature.4 It is now largely uncontested that sustainability, sustainable develop- ment, and climate change are defining moral imperatives of our time (e.g. Anon. 2007, Langhelle 1999, Varman 2009). For at least some faith commu- nities and leaders, key terms and concepts in this context are 'ecojustice' and 'climate justice.' The former is significant because it expands the earlier mainstream anthropocentric notion of social justice, the more recent notion of 'ecojustice' accepting not only that non-human life deserves moral consideration, but also that the ecological and social dimensions are interconnected. This paper, in two parts, takes the above ethical context as a basis from which to reflect on issues related to international conferencing, in particu- lar large international gatherings, and their associated ecological impacts. The issues discussed here arose for us in the context of the Parliament of the World's Religions (PWR), held in Melbourne, Australia in December 2009. We use this event as a case study to illustrate the kinds of vexing ques- tions and 'inconvenient truths' that may arise when reading the state of the world through the lenses of 'religion and ecology' and/or sustainability eth- ics - and when pondering morally right conduct that honours life in all its dimensions. In this paper, we share our questions, raise issues, and disclose our unease about a perceived disjunction between philosophy and practice in the ecclesiastical/multifaith and academic fields of 'religion and ecology.' Our intent in sharing possibly contentious 'inconvenient truths' about international meetings in the era of global warming is to open a forum to engage with what we consider to be critical issues of leadership, policy and praxis.5 Part 1 of the paper sets the conceptual context for our musings on inter- national conferencing in the era of global warming. Part 2 delineates impli- cations - conceptual, methodological, and practical - when 'religion 4) We capitalize Nature to point to the sanctity of all life; the sacredness of the web of life with its animate and inanimate aspects and the interconnections between them, which especially the Earth-centred indigenous spiritual traditions have always known. 5) These questions, issues and dilemmas arose for us as a volunteer-participant at the PWR (first author) and before, during and after the PWR event as a non-participant (second author). We state this here to make clear our respective perspectives, and to be open and transparent with regard to authorship of ethical positions. The issues of voice, representa- tion, and perspective are themselves ethical issues, highlighted in particular in such large events as the PWR Melbourne 2009 with its numerous opportunities for visibility of 'exper- tise' and in its corollary occasions for non-representation, obscurément and silence.</page><page sequence="4">i82 A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-195 and ecology/ religious environmentalism or sustainability ethics become normative frameworks for praxis. We begin the paper by briefly describing the PWR (Section 2). The paper then proceeds with a synopsis of religion and ecology (Section 3) before we sketch sustainability ethics as an ethical framework underlying our reflections (Section 4). International declara- tions and charters as elements of sustainability ethics are explored in Section 5, and conclude Part 1. In Part 2, the paper moves into questions and issues of international conferencing (Section 7). Sections 8 and 9 specify implications and ethical conundrums as well as positives, respectively Recommendations for future events (Section 10) and final thoughts (Section 11) conclude our analysis. 2. The Parliament of the World's Religions in the Context of 'Religion and Ecology' In general, religious organizations have been slow to respond, and more so to respond proactively, to the ecological crisis, awareness of which entered mainstream discourse in the 1960S-1970S (e.g. Collins 1995: 5, Conradie &amp; Martin 2007: 441, Goosen 2000: 206, Hessel &amp; Ruether 2000, Hessel 2009: 134, Macy in Kohn 2005; McDonagh 1990: 175 and 181-182, Mische 2000, Douglas 2009a: 725-729, Douglas 2009b). This is a key point in our paper. We return to and extrapolate from it throughout, detailing the view that reli- gious organizations and their representatives have a special role and responsibility advocating and living the sustainability and equity dimen- sions of the planetary and human conditions of the 21st century. To some degree, perhaps more so in relatively secularised domains, aca- demics may operate in a similar context to religious leaders, specifically where their scholarly work pertains to ethical issues. This extends to eco- logical ethics - a field in which there is increasing interaction with reli- gious scholars and with religious views in general, due in part to the so-called 'greening' of religion. This holds especially true for religious con- cern about the ethics associated with climate change and its implications. The PWR is a gathering of religious leaders and adherents, and also in part an academic conference. Contrary to what the name may imply, this 'Parliament' is not a governance, policy-setting, or decision-making body of and for the world's religions. It is not an inter-/multifaith equivalent to the ecumenical (Christian) World Council of Churches (WCC). Rather, the PWR, sponsored by the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions, is an international conference committed to fostering world peace through interreligious dialogue. It meets every five years "to address issues of peace,</page><page sequence="5">A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-195 183 social justice, and community sustainability" (C-PWR 2009, p. 8). The PWR was held for the first time in 1893 in Chicago, USA; was revived 100 years later, again in Chicago, USA in 1993; and has since been held in different cities around the world.6 The first PWR is credited with bringing Eastern religions to the West and with inspiring a universal interreligious brother- sisterhood. According to the PWR Executive Director, the name 'Parliament' has historical roots and is used in its original meaning of 'a place and meet- ing where discussion occurs' (Ficca personal communication).7 As the largest inter-/multifaith gathering in the world, the PWR brings together a large number of religious leaders and representatives from faith- based organizations, both professionals (e.g. ordinates and/or academics) and laypeople. In Melbourne, Australia in December 2009, PWR organizers indicate 6000 - 8000 people from many regions of the world came together to learn about each others' faiths; to strengthen and deepen their connec- tion to their own faith within interreligious dialogue; and to be inspired on their religious journey. The PWR Melbourne 2009 conference theme Hearing each other, healing the earth focused interreligious understanding and recognized the need for global ecological restoration and protection. Notably, the event theme highlighted the growing awareness of the inter- connectedness of many religious and ecological concerns. Under seven conference strands, the PWR offered more than 500 religious observances, plenary sessions, symposia, performances, exhibits, and other activities over the course of seven days: • Healing the Earth with care and concern • Indigenous people • Overcoming poverty in an unequal world • Securing food and water for all people • Building peace in the pursuit of justice • Creating social cohesion in village and city, and • Sharing wisdom in the search for inner peace (C-PWR 2009, p.9) The subject matter of 'religion and ecology' was introduced to the PWR for the first time at the Melbourne gathering and featured prominently. This presents significant progress with respect to the PWR addressing and grap- pling with the human-Nature-Earth-God relationships (Tucker &amp; Grim 2009). In the context of the PWR, environmentalism in the form of "healing the earth" and ecojustice appeared to be accepted for the first time as 6) Cape Town, South Africa 1999; Barcelona, Spain 2004; Melbourne, Australia 2009 7) For more detail on the PWR philosophy and history, see www.parliamentofreligions.org/ index.cfm?n=8&amp;sn=i2.</page><page sequence="6">184 A. Bcringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-1 95 'core business' for the world's religions and for interfaith dialogue. Some religious leaders and academics have previously recognized these connec- tions (e.g. Harvard Project on Religion and Ecology). The PWR 2009 raised a number of ethical issues and concerns for us with respect to the event themes, the organisational goals, and the role of religious leaders and academics in elucidating ecological and associated social challenges, and their prospective management. Applying the theme of 'religion and ecology' as an ethical lens to this event, we continue to struggle with critical questions about the validity and form of international conferences, religious or secular, in the era of climate change and 'peak oil.' In particular, we wonder how the benefits of such events may be consid- ered against their eco-social costs, to produce a transparent evaluation of whether an international event is (1) consistent with its own ethos and (2) whether such events are more broadly ethically justifiable given the state of the world and the moral imperative of sustainability. Quintessentially, our reflection and critique asks whether international conferencing in general, and holding mega-events such as the PWR 2009, can be ethically justified in the era of climate change. If yes, under what conditions and within what allowances and/or limits? What are the ethical rationales for air travel and its associated greenhouse (GHG) emissions for an event such as the PWR 2009, and, by extension, for secular academic conferences and other large international gatherings (major sports events such as the World Soccer Championships 2010 in South Africa, for instance)? What are the benefits of the PWR which might outweigh or balance the substantial ecological impacts of this gathering? How can these outcomes and impacts be calcu- lated, and weighed against each other? Within the framework of religion and ecology, this paper also speaks to the fundamental question: should international conferencing be continued in its conventional form, given its eco-social impacts and the state of the global environment? The methodol- ogy with which these kinds of questions can be addressed is important, as are the philosophical assumptions and the set of spiritual principles that underlie our questions and reflections. In this paper, we advocate a comprehensive and inclusive cost-benefit analysis that commits to triple- (TBL), preferably quadruple-bottomline (QBL) accounting. (The fourfold accounting of ecological security, social equity, economic prosperity, and spiritual well-being is explained further in the paper.) A QBL analysis internalizes all ecological and social costs, includes them in accounting and reporting mechanisms and instruments, and weighs them against perceived and/or actual benefits. The purpose of such analysis, accounting and reporting is to catalyze improved sustain- ability performance of future PWR and other events, and to stimulate</page><page sequence="7">A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 ( 2012 ) 179-195 185 critical reflection and discussion on possibly more appropriate forms of gathering, networking, exchange and capacity-building. 3. Religion and Ecology Recent years have seen an increasing number of spiritual leaders, religious institutions and faith-based organizations (re-)discover ecology, caring for the Earth or a form of environmentalism as a central imperative in their teachings (cf. UNEP 2010). As the Harvard Project on Religion and Ecology (Tucker &amp; Grim 1996-1998) indicated, all world religions contain essential teachings on the human relationship with Nature. Just as the Golden Rule and compassion weave themselves through the world's religions, advising fundamental ethical conduct in human-human relationships (cf. Küng 1993, Armstrong et al. 2009), so do the world's religions teach ethical prin- ciples with respect to humanity's rightful conduct in human-Nature rela- tionships (Nasr 2007). "Religious environmentalism is a worldwide, multireligious phenomenon as evidenced by the work of groups such as the Alliance of Religions &amp; Conservation,8 the Interfaith Partnership for the Environment9 (Bassett et al. 2000) and the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions" (Douglas 2009a: 720). Gottlieb (2006a: 7) comments that: ...many of the world's faith communities have taken up the challenges posed by the environmental crisis and responded with passionate commitment. Religions have become part of the all too scarce good news on the environmental front - one more element in a worldwide environmental movement. Some key publications dealing with religious environmentalism include the Religions of the world and ecology series,10 the earlier World religions and ecology series,11 The Encyclopaedia of religion and nature (Taylor 2005) and The Oxford handbook of religion and ecology (Gottlieb 2006b).

Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-195 bibliographies of the literature. Most of the literature on religious environ- mentalism is specific to a particular faith. Exceptions include Finlay &amp; Palmer (2003), Gardner (2002, 2003, 2006), Gottlieb (2006a, 2006b, 2007), Taylor (2004), Tucker (1997, 2003) and Douglas (2009a). In recent years, the world's religions have undergone at least some form of 'greening' (cf. UNEP 2010, R. Nash 1989, Douglas 2009a). The theme of 'religion and ecology' is now present in all religious traditions and is begin- ning to enter mainstream religious discourse in all major traditions. Many religious and spiritual leaders have made statements and commitments regarding climate change, including the Greek Orthodox leader Patriarch Bartholomew, Hindu leaders (e.g. Bhumi Project 2009), the current and for- mer Popes, the Dalai Lama, and the World Council of Churches (2008). This awareness of and commitment to religious leadership, particularly on cli- mate change, was present at the PWR 2009 as well: the gathering of Hindu spiritual leaders put forward a declaration on climate change (HPI 2009), and climate change was highlighted in the Indigenous Peoples' Declaration as the most critical issue facing humanity (Indigenous Peoples' Assembly 2009). Further, a number of religious groups put out messages or petitions to the UN Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen, held the week after the PWR 2009. Examples include the Brahma Kumaris and Bishop Geoff Davis from the Southern African Faith Communities' Environment Institute (Davies 2009). A large banner on the footbridge outside the conference venue, under which the entire PWR assembled at its conclusion on 9 December 2009, affirmed the PWR's climate message to world leaders in Copenhagen. Sensitivity to climate change was perhaps particularly promi- nent at the PWR 2009, with the long-anticipated UN Copenhagen Climate Change Summit and expectations for a new (extended) legally binding global agreement on reducing GHG emissions on many people's mind. Many PWR participants seemed to be attuned to the Copenhagen negotia- tions, desiring a positive result. In fact, a number of spiritual leaders left the PWR early to fly to Copenhagen, to render spiritual support at that interna- tional meeting. The latter behaviour brings to the forefront the kinds of ethical ques- tions we raise in this paper - questions that we believe are widely unseen or dismissed because of their nature as 'inconvenient truths.' They illustrate our case in point: when is ecological harm (through substantial GHG emis- sions due to international aviation) justified, for religious or other pur- poses? Did these religious leaders really need to be in Copenhagen in person, given the principle of prayer that 'energy follows thought' and more, that collective spiritual energy bridges physical distance? Does the</page><page sequence="9">A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews /6 (2012) 179-195 187 power of group meditation not lie in joint purpose and the strength of col- lective intent rather than physical presence in the same room? Further, do video-conferencing, the Internet and related communication technologies not suffice in connecting religious leaders to each other and to their devo- tees, or to their purposes and work? May these technologies be considered profane? These are not easy questions to hear nor to answer, yet they are important to consider when the actions of religious organizations and lead- ers constitute exemplars and influence the minds and conduct of so many. Perhaps more than some, religious leaders are better equipped to reflect on such issues, for spiritual teachings advise, for instance, on matters of hypoc- risy; of checking intent versus consequences before acting; of balancing personal, lower self interests with behaviours borne of a 'higher' conscious- ness; and of subduing the ego toward making sacrifices for the common good. Whilst all world religions have undergone something of an "ecological conversion" as called for by Pope John Paul II (1990), this process is not uni- versal or complete. Some traditions within broad faith groups remain 'anti- environmentalisť or at least deeply suspicious and critical of anything resembling environmentalism (e.g. Hessel 2009: 134, Douglas 2009a: 728-729). Others are at very early stages of acknowledging the global eco- logical crisis, its causes and possible remedies in the context of their faith traditions. There is a definite spectrum of 'ungreen' through shades of 'light green' to 'dark green' amongst faith traditions, just as is evident in wider society. Whilst the 'greening' of religion is incomplete and remains largely at the theological and symbolic policy level, it is relatively pervasive and continues to develop. 4. Sustainability Ethics Ethical reflection requires an ethical framework as a point of departure from which to articulate ethical questions, frame the ethical dimensions of issues, and construct moral dilemmas. As the preceding outline on 'religion and ecology' demonstrates, all world religions now recognize the Earth and its non-human life as part of the religious sphere and the moral domain. Motivated by the precarious condition of the Earth's climate, this concern now extends to the Earth's atmosphere as well. This moral extensionism has evolved relatively rapidly over the last decade. A key part of the 'greening' of religion is its engagement with sustain- ability ethics. As a field, an academic sub-/discipline, and/or as a formal</page><page sequence="10">i88 A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-195 community of practice, sustainability ethics is still in its infancy (e.g. Ott &amp; Döring 2008). Faith-based organizations and religious leaders are contrib- uting to the field and are helping to shape collective ethics for sustainabil- ity. For instance, faith-inspired ethical principles have found their way into international declarations and charters. Some of these were presented at the PWR 2009 (e.g. A Manifesto for a Global Economic Ethic - Küng 2009; Earth Charter - Slaby et al. 2009, Tucker et al. 2009); we will explore them further below in Section 5. The main ethical precept of sustainability ethics is intra- and intergen- erational justice. Sustainability/sustainable development14 call for balanc- ing economic with ecological and social concerns, and recognizing their interdependency in building sustainable futures. 'Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (WCED 1987) succinctly summarizes the dominant ethical imperative of sustainability. Usually, 'generations' is interpreted to mean human generations. Some ethicists have called for consideration of non- human species in sustainable development analysis (e.g. Buchdahl &amp; Raper 1998, Jeffery 2005, cf. Görke 2003). Other scholars call for moral consider- ation of abiotic ecosystem components such as mountains and rivers and / or including ecosystem functions and services in ethical analysis (see Light 8c Rolston 2003 Part II). Intra- and intergenerational justice thus becomes intra- and interspecies justice, and extends the moral sphere to include the entire planet. Thus, justice, in its interpretation as individual and collective rights, distributive and retributive justice, and procedural fairness becomes the prevalent notion of 'meeting needs' in achieving sustainability. In its extension to sustainability ethics, the principle of intra- and intergenera- tional justice finds its expression as ecojustice and also, more recently, as climate justice (e.g. Davies 2009, Robinson 2009). Both terms appear to be accepted in secular environmentalist and religious environmentalist domains, suggesting growing commonality of understanding and purpose. 'Meeting needs' is not confined to ethical precepts of justice, however. Religions and spirituality can contribute to two principal aspects of the sus- tainability discourse; as such, the world's religions are critical forces in building sustainability ethics - in theory, policy and practice. (1) They can provide fundamental non-economic human motivations for individual and collective behaviour change toward a more harmoni- ous human-Nature relationship (cf. Nasr 2007, Raiser 2003). This is ,4) We note the contested nature of this term and phenomenon, especially when sustaina- ble development is equated with economic growth.</page><page sequence="11">A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldvtews 16 ( 2012 ) 179-195 189 especially critical since the mainstream secular sustainability discourse and practice has largely neglected the power of religious motivations as societal forces; this has limited its success (Raiser 2003). (2) Religions and spirituality offer additional and alternative ethical prin- ciples - such as care and respect - to the sustainability ethics dis- course. An example is the Christian notion of 'caring for Creation' (e.g. Boff 2008, Leal 2003). Thereby, religions extend the ethical precepts of sustainability beyond justice (ecojustice, climate justice) to include moral motivations and moral intuitions (e.g. caring, compassion) toward which individuals may be more inclined. Religions present a range of moral predispositions or proclivities that can inspire practitio- ners for ethical conduct toward fellow humans and other life forms. In this regard, it is worth noting that academic ethics has rarely if ever received religious ethics kindly. Within the rational-scientific paradigm of the Enlightenment, rational ethics have been favoured instead (cf. Nasr 2007). As contributors and participants in this discourse, religion and spiri- tuality thus confront an entrenched rational-scientific-intellectual-irreli- gious (anti-religious) paradigm; a paradigm which they may be the only ones to break. Nasr (2007) provides further details why religion and spiritu- ality are the primary human motivations to break through rational and thus limited ecological ethics. An example of a multifaith ethical framework that can inform religious sustainability ethics is Right Earth Relations. A detailed exposition of Right Earth Relations, including a critique of its foundations, is beyond the scope of this paper; suffice to say that it is an ecological/sustainability ethic rooted in the Perennial Philosophy ( sophia perennis , religio perennis) and the tra- ditionalist paradigm. As such, it is a multifaith, universal ethical frame- work. Perennial Philosophy underlies and is reflected in all world religions and spiritual traditions (Chittick 2007). According to traditionalists, reli- gions are expressions of the common cosmology, knowledge and ethical precepts of Perennial Philosophy, adjusted for the historical and cultural conditions in which they were revealed or which they developed in (Oldmeadow 2008). The Right Earth Relations sustainability ethic draws its inspiration from the principles and ethics of Right Human Relations which provide guidelines for moral conduct between people. It features the ethi- cal principles of goodwill and peace. Right Earth Relations extends the tra- ditionalist philosophy and Right Human Relations ethics to the human-Nature relationship; this moral extension was foreshadowed when Right Human Relations was introduced within the traditionalist literature in the mid-i940S (Beringer 2009).</page><page sequence="12">190 A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-195 This section of the paper has sketched sustainability ethics as a frame- work for ethical analysis in the field of religion and ecology. Further, we outlined the criteria that ethical principles need to meet to serve an inter- and multifaith agenda in religion and ecology. We now turn to international declarations and charters that can inform religious and secular sustainabil- ity ethics and practice. 5. International Declarations and Charters International declarations and charters, especially when they have been drafted by ethicists and/or religious leaders and organizations, can be drawn upon to build sustainability ethics in theory, policy and practice. Three such charters - the Earth Charter, the Charter for Compassion, and the Manifesto for a Global Economic Ethic - were presented at the PWR 2009 and serve here as examples, as well as points for critique. The Earth Charter is much stronger on interspecies ethics than the inter- faith Charter for Compassion (Armstrong et al. 2009) that was written in 2008 and 'marketed' at the PWR 2009. Formulated in 2000, the Earth Charter is grounded in a much broader and deeper public consultation process than the Charter for Compassion (Tucker et al. 2009). The objective of the Charter for Compassion is interfaith dialogue (i.e. the PWR 2009 theme "hearing each other") rather than the human-Nature relationship (i.e. PWR 2009 theme "healing the Earth"). The Charter for Compassion is anthropo- centric, perhaps at best biocentric in the tradition of the animal rights movement. Its reference to seeking to "alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures" is simplistic, potentially anthropomorphic, and fails to recognise the implications of the profound interdependency of human systems with the biosphere. By ignoring, perhaps even silencing by default, the impor- tant ecological dimensions, a widely disseminated manifesto like the Charter for Compassion seems harmful and perpetuates the relatively immature and problematic stewardship ethic seen in most of early reli- gious environmentalism. While the Charter for Compassion may be seen as complementary to the Earth Charter (Tucker in Tucker et al. 2009), it largely limits religious consciousness to the human sphere. The huge positive reception it received at the PWR 2009, as opposed to the minimal atten- dance at the Earth Charter sessions, is indicative of the dominant state of 'greening' of the interfaith movement and its proponents, i.e. the move- ment remains anthropocentric, or at best biocentric, and is ecologically naïve.</page><page sequence="13">A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (20/2) 179-195 191 The Earth Charter/Charter for Compassion observations at the PWR 2009 serve to illustrate a key point: world religions and interfaith dialogues are dominated by institutional faiths and their, for the most part, deeply entrenched anthropocentrism. The PWR, like many other religious and faith-inspired institutions, is an entity with an anthropocentric history, with limited ecological literacy and institutional capacity for facilitating sustainability. This is true of most institutional world religions, and is a major factor in explaining why they were generally late to discover environ- mentalism, late to accept its core values, and still struggle to convert their emergent environmentalism from symbolism into substance (e.g. Douglas 2008, 2009a, 2009b). The Manifesto for a Global Economic Ethic (Küng 2009) also provides guidance on sustainability ethics. It was developed by the World Ethics Project under chairmanship of well-known Swiss-German theologian Hans Küng (Küng 2009, Küng 1993). Speaking about a new globally binding eco- nomic ethic at the PWR 2009, Küng was clear on the ecological imperative, stating "the preservation of ecological systems, functions and services has prevalence over the preservation of social systems" (Küng 2009). This ethi- cal imperative is rooted in ecological realities and informed by science: all economic systems and activities ultimately depend on ecological systems and their associated functions and services; similarly, economic systems and activities depend on well-functioning social systems. The interdepen- dence of the ecological, social and economic domains highlighted in the notion of sustainability is not an equal interdependency and is uni-direc- tional: economic systems depend on social systems and social systems (including human expressions of religion) depend on ecological systems, though not vice versa. As the ecojustice model points out, we depend on Nature; Nature does not depend on us per se.15 Sustainability ethics can benefit from using philosophical and secular ethical parameters and principles. It can also be established and is enriched l5) We acknowledge that some ecosystems and components thereof have evolved with a substantial history of human intervention such that the removal of that intervention would be likely to change the ecological outcomes, and not necessarily for the better, even from an ecocentric view. An example of this is discontinuing Aboriginal use of fire in many Australian landscapes and the extent to which some species, communities and ecosystems are adapted to and even substantially depend on that use. We also accept that non-indigenous species introduced by modern humans may have a greater impact in the absence of mitigation measures. Thus, there are now valid questions about the extent to which at least parts of Nature are dependent on human actions. However, Nature as a whole is not dependent on our actions.</page><page sequence="14">192 A. Beringer and S. Douglas / Worldviews 16 (2012) 179-195 by drawing on religious ethical sentiments. For instance, from a Christian perspective, the notion of 'ecological sin' (e.g. Becker 1992, J. Nash 1991) highlights principled guidance and conduct informed by religious-spiritual ethics. From a Buddhist or Hindu perspective, one can translate this under- standing into the idea of 'ecological karma' - good karma incurred for pro- ecological behaviour and negative karma incurred for ecologically harmful activities. For our purposes, the sentiment of 'ecological sin' or 'ecological karma' finds expression in the question whether flying around the world to con- tribute in person to the PWR 2009 incurs debt (sin, negative karma)? Further, in what circumstances may such potential sin/negative karma be transformed into a positive outcome? These kinds of questions lead into issues of ecological footprint assessment and carbon accounting that are addressed later on in this paper. Now that the groundwork for an ethical analysis of 'religion and ecology' issues has been sketched, our discussion can move into a deeper ethical analysis of international religious and/or academic conferencing in part 2 of this essay. In doing so, we continue to rely on the PWR 2009 as a case study, asking the reader to apply our analysis and reflection to other inter- national gatherings and/or events which rely on international travel, e.g. UN Climate Change Summits; the Initiative fora UN Decade of Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue, Understanding and Cooperation for Peace 2011- 2020; the Global Peace Initiative of Women; the bi-annual World Environ- mental Education Congress (WEEC); among many others.
