Milstein (Compilers). 1989. Struik Winchester, Cape Town (P.O. Box 3755, Cape Town, South Africa). 760 pp., color photographs, paintings, diagrams and distribution maps throughout. ISBN 0-947430-11-3. R225.00.-Few regions in the Southern Hemisphere can boast an array of popular bird books as diverse and glossily produced as that of southern Africa. Despite (or per- haps because of) political upheaval in several of the countries in that region, there has been a strong surge of popular interest in ornithology, and a mushroom- ing of research activity by both amateurs and profes- sionals. While dozens of books on birds of the region have been published in the last decade, this lavish tome (weighing 4 kg!) clearly was produced with the hope that it will be the definitive reference on the subject for many years to come. As a publishing event, its history is epic, and its immediate impact is cer- tainly impressive. The book is aimed at both professionals and lay- men, although its bulk and large format relegate it to the (sturdy) coffee table rather than the rucksack or office bookshelf. As a compilation of photographs, paintings, and information on the 914 species re- corded in the region, its value is high-there is cer- tainly no other collection of this scale and visual qual- ity. Most of the photographs (by 150 photographers) are outstanding, and these alone could justify the price for enthusiasts. Some photos show curious behaviors (e.g. a young Black-headed Heron, Ardea melanoceph- ala, eating a smaller chick on a neighboring nest), and most others are superb portraits that quite adequately show identifying marks, in contrast to early photo- graphic field guides. Clear, uncluttered paintings by Graeme Arnott show 55 species (mainly swifts and warblers) for which good photos were not available. Preceding the species accounts is a forward by the late Eric Hosking, and a nicely written and illustrated general introduction to the evolutionary history, clas- sification, and adaptations of birds. This section, by Peter Milstein, will be of interest to the lay reader, but is also sufficiently detailed to supplement under- graduate ornithology courses in the region. There also are essays by Milstein on the biogeography of African birds in relation to rainfall, altitude and geo- logical history, with valuable and attractive photo- graphs and maps of biomes in southern Africa. These will be of particular value to readers unfamiliar with the region. Nonetheless, an interesting biome map contains some curious elements: the Okavango Delta, Lake St. Lucia, and the ephemeral Etosha and Makga- dikgadi pans are all grouped as Azonal Habitats, while areas of dry acacia savanna and moist broadleaved woodland (e.g. central Namibia and the Caprivi Strip) are grouped as Mixed Woodland, separate from cat- egories of Arid Woodland and Moist Woodland. A map called "Wetland Zones" implies that vegetation, rainfall, and temperature zones are clearly delimited (Arid Zone and Highveld Zone are separated by a somewhat arbitrary north-south wiggly line), and I doubt the value of such a crudely categorical ap- proach. However, these points do not detract from the value and readability of Milstein's text, which treats the diversity and vulnerability of the southern African landscape with the sophistication they de- serve. In the brief species accounts that form the bulk of the book, a general description is often enriched by personal observations. Nearly one-half of the 36 con- tributors are amateur ornithologists, which reflects the input that committed "weekend watchers" have made to the ornithology of the region over the years. In some accounts the personal notes are excessively anecdotal, but in general they convey an interesting richness of experience that the standard reference works cannot. Following the general descriptions of each species, brief notes are included on distribution and occurrence (usually with maps), appearance, voice, behavior, food and feeding methods, and breeding biology. Completing the book are a short bibliography, a glossary, acknowledgments, lists of contributors and subscribers, and a diagram of bird anatomy. The anat- omy diagram should have appeared at the beginning, with the section on anatomical adaptations. Indices of English, scientific, and Afrikaans bird names will help readers unfamiliar with phylogeny to find spe- cies accounts. These are the book's stronger points. Two aspects disappointed me, and detract from an otherwise im- pressive compilation. The first is a lack of specific citations, which limits the book's value as a reference. The brief bibliography, largely a list of previous pop- ular books on southern African birds, is adequate only as a starting point for the layman. The curious reader who wants to verify a statement has to write to the specific contributor. Unfortunately, the contributors are listed only by their titles and affiliations or towns of residence, and not by postal addresses. Related to this, and more unfortunate, is the "dat- edness" of some of the species accounts and the bib- 208</page><page sequence="2">January 1992] Reviews 209 liography. The book was eight years in planning and production, and I have the impression that the con- tributors and compilers were reluctant to update their species accounts during that time. While the list of contributors includes many people who have made significant contributions to southern African orni- thology, and species accounts were usually written by those who knew the birds best, I was disappointed to see that younger researchers were generally over- looked. As a few examples, Richard Watson's study of Bateleurs (Terathopius ecaudatus), Morne du Plessis' of Red-billed Woodhoopoes (Phoeniculus purpureus), Chris Brown's of Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), Rob Simmons' of African Marsh Harriers (Circus rani- vorus) and other raptors, Dave Ward's of Vanellus plov- ers, and Dawid de Swardt's of Gurney's Sugarbirds (Promerops gurneyi) could have enhanced the book im- measurably. While the authors of accounts for these species mainly did a good job, it simply is not true to say, for example (as did Tony Tree), that no one knows about the ecological relationships of Vanellus plovers. Even if Tree was unaware of Ward's studies, the com- pilers should have been familiar with his work. Carl Vernon's needlessly anthropomorphic account of the whydahs (Vidua) also overlooks existing information on their mating system and breeding biology, and incorporates a poor, previously published photo of feeding Paradise Whydahs that wrongly suggests lek behavior. Others have noted these weaknesses. Miles Stevens (1990. Birding in Southern Africa 42[1]:28) lamented that this book, as others before it, ignored data published in avicultural journals. The datedness is further re- flected in the bibliography of the book; only 5 of the 74 items are dated 1983 or later, and most are from the 1960s and 1970s. This perhaps reflects the com- pilers' own peaks of ornithological activity, but in a book calling itself "complete," such datedness and selectivity are a bit shameful. This book, therefore, is not a state-of-the-art com- pendium, nor is it of great reference value to profes- sionals. It is, however, an impressive and very worth- while book for community and specialist libraries, and for anyone interested in the region's birds. Its price puts it beyond the reach of many individuals in southern Africa, but the exchange rate for most other currencies makes it more affordable elsewhere. If you have the time and money, this book will cer- tainly provide you with many hours of absorbing, informative, and visually satisfying reading.-PHOEBE Barnard, University of Namibia, Private Bag 13301, Wind- hoek, Namibia.</page></plain_text>
