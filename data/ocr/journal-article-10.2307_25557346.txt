<plain_text><page sequence="1">35 Although John Aiken has been active as a sculptor for the last fifteen years, the free standing durable objects in the current ex hibition are the first that he has shown since leaving Chelsea College of Art in 1973. Aiken's past work consisted almost entirely of time-based installations, which often utilised the fluid, malleable proper ties of sand to facilitate their changing ap pearances, as for example, his Time Space Series, in the Project Arts Centre, Dublin, 1978. In the light of such long term commitment to process-based art the cur rent work must be seen to mark a con scious stylistic transition, on the part of the artist, towards a more traditional form of artistic expression. In a literal sense the sand has become petrified, and the artistic concept metamorphosed into static ag glomerations of wood, steel and rock. To interpret such a change in a negative way would be to do the artist an injustice however, and whilst the forms themselves are static the atmosphere of the show is quite electric. Aiken's work has literally taken over the exhibition space at the Douglas Hyde. It is carefully and subtly arranged creating a gesamt kunstwerk of considerable atmospheric impact. The exhibition is accompanied by a fine ly illustrated catalogue, and in her in troductory essay, Catherine Lampert tells us that in order to set some physical con straint on his work for the exhibition, Aiken made twenty-two lumps of Purbeck Stone, weighing in total one ton, his primary resource. From these, and with the addi tion of metal and wood, the sixteen pieces of sculpture which make up the exhibition emerged. Individual works range in size from small wall-mounted items to larger free-standing complexes combining a variety of materials. The fundamental substance however is the Purbeck Stone itself, and this appears either in its natural form as apparently untouched angular fragments, or with varying degrees of modification involving cutting, rake carving and polishing. In works such as Purbeck, and Ocean's Edge, the stone itself is allowed to speak and express its character, with the minimum of in terference from the sculptor. Each com prises three fragments mounted one above the other, which increase in manual refine ment upwards, from a natural base, through a rough surface-tooled element, to a final carved molluscular form. The gradual process of upward transition seems to crystallise out the essential nature of the stone which is of course a conglomeration of such fossilised elements, implying a man-made reversal of its natural process of formation. Such interaction between man and nature, between imposed order and the natural one, is a theme which the exhibition explores at length and in diverse metaphorical ways. Sometimes the stone is used in its John Aiken, 'Reaching'. Purbeck Stone, steel and wood, 1987/8. 190 x 120 x 50 cms. polished state with all the decorative gloss so admired by the Victorians, as a solitary wall-mounted slab in Fragment, or in combination with other material elements in Edge, and Borderline. Fragment, dated 1985, is the earliest work included in the show, and relates directly to a frieze done by the artist for Belfast City Hospital at that time. There, Aiken produced a se quence of rectangular polished forms in which the naturally occurring undulating shapes of the fossil fragments visible on the surface of the rock were allowed to form the basis of the decoration. These were augmented here and there with 'sym pathetic' abstract configurations such as the expanding helix carved into the surface and subsequently gilded, in the example on show. Such spiral forms are important motifs in Aiken's work, having on the one hand resonances of his Celtic roots (he was born in Belfast), but more importantly they can be seen as a leit motif which underlies the expression of what is perhaps his key ar tistic theme, i.e. the exploration of the rela tionship of the rational form to the natural one. A drawing (no drawings were includ ed in the show) reproduced in the catalogue for a previous installation in Dublin, in 1981, demonstrates this quintessential relationship. It shows a spiral superimposed by its angular geometrical equivalent, and is reminiscent of the hermetic diagrams of Renaissance scien tists such as Luca Pacioli, who was par ticularly interested in seeking desirable cor respondences between art, science and nature qua God. Aiken's own previous work has been directly inspired by such things as an 'anthropomorphic' city plan by the Renaissance architect Francesco di Giorgio, echoes of which seem apparent in the large free-standing exhibit entitled Reaching. Here in an intriguing combina tion of elements, a rough stone 'figure' ap pears to ascend a precisely constructed 'ladder', the lower ends of which seem to double as arms for the figure, and ter minate in angular spiral 'hands'. The lad der itself appears also as a grid and serves to geometrically subdivide the human organism into a sequence of rational proportions. A visit to Rome in the early 1970's led Aiken to become interested in the dynamic geometry of Futurist art and its relation ship to the technology of war. He became fascinated with the form and concept of military installations such as gun em placements and began a period of research into the fortifications of the Atlantic wall and the Maginot line. The results are still evident in works such as Torres Vedras,</page><page sequence="2">36 which consists of a piece of rough-hewn rock, surmounted by an angular steel framework, suggestive of a hill-top fortifica tion. The sharp machine-cut angularity of the gleaming metal, contrasts dramatical ly with the soft amorphous dullness of the basal rock, creating an essential aesthetic polarity. I am reminded of the way in which the contrived formality of a classical garden achieves its most heightened effect when seen against the backdrop of a wilderness beyond. In other pieces, such as Edge, and Borderline, such military connotations suggest a political slant to the work, most overtly perhaps in the latter. Here a meandering eucalyptus branch is sur mounted by a fragment of coarse stone, which is itself capped by an angular polyhedral slab, shaped like a tank turret. The allusion would clearly seem to refer to the menacing observation posts which adorn the troubled borderland of Aiken's native country, and would forge a thematic link with past installation projects, such as Without the Walls, of 1980. Aside from their symbolic and metaphorical connotations, a number of the works have an intriguing decorative quality that is in part bound up with the natural beauty of the polished marble, but is also due to the craftsmanlike refinement of the construction. Polished stone and wooden laminates inlaid between shining strips of metal feature in such pieces as Blue Pool, and Journey, and imbue them with something of the aesthetic quality achieved by the French eboniste. The tac tile allure of such man-made refinements serves to emphasise the contrast with the natural substances, when the two are com bined, and one is ever reminded by such coincidences of the tensions and equilibriums inherent in these relation ships, the exploration of which is the underlying theme of Aiken's work.
