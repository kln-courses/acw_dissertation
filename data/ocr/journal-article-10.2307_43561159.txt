<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vergi lij Atanasov Children's Musical Instruments and Musical Playthings in Bulgaria The children's musical instruments are not present in any of the existing scien- tific systematics as a separately differentiated group. Therefore, the term 'chil- dren's musical instruments' shall bear a conditional-explanatory meaning within the scope of the present article. Regardless of the differences between village and town in terms of social and sonic environment, as well as disregarding the predominance in town of the so- called 'town musical instruments' or 'classical musical instruments,' the 'tradi- tional folk musical instruments' and the 'children's musical instruments' have long ago become very popular all over the country. Some of the children's musical instruments and musical playthings feature a pure ethnic affiliation while others have penetrated on different paths directly from the international instrumental fund or are made on the model of the latter. The children - mainly those who live in villages - make their instruments and play- things themselves because the nature surrounding them offers the necessary materials which are nonexistent in town or are present only to a very limited extent. Because of their multiplicity, it is not possible to describe all children's musical instruments and playthings within the framework of this presentation. They can in general be classified in the following manner: (I) Objects or instruments for amusement of the youngest children; (II) Instruments with which children amuse themselves when playing games; (III) Instruments with which children make music, i.e., instruments used for play- ing tunes, including simple orcomplicated tunes, or even melodies which are closely related to those played by adults. On the other hand, the children's musical instruments and playthings can be divided as follows: (I) By musical denotation, i.e., sonic ortonal and rhythmical (Pischner 1955:31); (II) According to the kind and origin of the material and from a technological point of view, i.e., - 'sounding-solids-instruments' (Schultz 1954:9) of seasonal or non- durable material, as well as those of lasting material which children take 68</page><page sequence="2">directly from the surrounding environment to be used for playing either without preliminary adaptation or with preliminary adaptation and cultiva- tion, - instruments made by younger children and instruments made by older children or adults, - children's musical instruments and musical playthings made from diffe- rent materials at specialized workshops. The children buy these at mar- kets or fairs. (III) Instruments made on the analogy of certain traditional folk musical instru- ments but reduced in size, or the traditional instruments themselves, which - depending on the category of the instrument - can be played by older and stronger children. (IV) Instruments with so-called 'secondary function for the music' (Atanasov 1977:19, 1983:16). These are objects from everyday life with episodic partici- pation in the 'traditional-ceremonial system' or in the 'calendar holidays of the people' in which also the children take part. From the organologica! viewpoint, the children's musical instruments and musical playthings shall be presented in the following order: idiophones, mem- branophones, aerophones, and chordophones. Idiophones Concussion plaques Carevično trakalo (maize rattle) - an idioglot1 with sound-rhythmical characte- ristics; a plaything. It is prepared from a piece of maize stalk with a length of three nodes. The stalk is cut longitudinally between the first and the second node so that two or three parallel plaques are formed. When the rattle is shaken it produ- ces rhythmicized sounds resembling the clapper of a stork. Maša (tongs) - an idioglot with a sound-rhythmical effect and with a secondary musical function; made of iron. The tongs are applied in the traditional-ceremo- nial system and are used on the day before Annunciation. The children take the tongs and dust-pan (or another iron object), take a walk around a house while hit- ting the tongs continuously against the dust-pan and utter sentences such as "Run away, you snakes and lizards, because tomorrow is Annunciation." Through the noise they make and with the 'aid'of these words, the children wish the master of the house that no snakes and reptiles may visit his home, i.e., good health and prosperity. 69</page><page sequence="3">III. 1. Dâska s petleta ("a wooden plate with roosters") 70</page><page sequence="4">Percussive plaques Dâska s petleta ("a wooden plate with roosters") - a heteroglot with a sound- rhythmical effect; a plaything. This plaything can only be purchased at markets or fairs. When the plate is shaken, the roosters peck with their bills against it as though they pick corn (Illustration 1). Frame rattles Sirivnjak - a heteroglot with a sound-rhythmical effect being applied in the traditional-ceremonial system; handmade by children. The instrument repre- sents a primitive sistrum made of a wooden stick which is forked at one end. Be- tween the crotch of such a branch, a tightly stretched piece of wire with thin metal slabs is strung. Shaking the sirivnjak causes the metal slabs to produce a typical metallic sound. On the 1st of January, when children visit various homes in order to greet the people and wish them health and happiness, they vigorously shake the sirivnjak at the front door and shout "Happy New Year." The sirivnjak is often used along with another rattle. Vessel rattles with a free acting generator These represent sounding bodies-instruments, taken directly from the natural environment. Kratunka-drânkalka (gourd-rattle) - a heteroglot of vegetable origin, taken directly from the environment, not adapted.The gourd-rattle has a closed, spheri- cal body with an undefined number of free floating sound generators inside -the dried seeds of the gourd. When shaking the gourd-rattle it produces a comparati- vely weak rhythmicized sound. The rattle is used for amusement of babies. Oreh-drânkalka ("nut-rattle") - a heteroglot of vegetable origin, taken directly from the natural environment, adapted. Small stones or rice are placed in an empty walnut-shell. The shell halves are glued together or tied with a string, thus forming a closed cavity with free acting generators. Upon shaking, the nut-rattle produces a comparatively weak rhythmicized sound. This rattle is used for amus- ing babies. Scraped idiophones Krečetalo (scraper) - a heteroglot with a sound-rhythmical character, with application in the traditional-ceremonial system; a plaything made of hazelbush. The rattle can be made by children. Although bound to traditional shape, the Bul- 71</page><page sequence="5">garian rattle has several modifications: rattle-wheel, rattle dancing doll, etc. which are machine-made to different sizes.The sound of the rattle resembles the sound produced by a watermill or the clapper of a stork. Wind idiophones This subgroup represents sounding solid-instruments, taken directly from the natural environment and not adapted, of non-durable, seasonal character. These include: Strâk treva ("a blade of grass"). Idioglot (Illustration 2 A). List ot kesten ("chestnut leaf"): A section of the leaf is held between the tongue and the palate (Illustration 2B).The sound is produced by blowing. Idioglot. Dàrvesni lista ("leaves"): The greater part of a leaf is held firmly towards the lower lip (Illustration 2C).The player blows against the remaining free end in order to produce a sound. Idioglot. Membranophones Membranophones with two skin membranes Dětsko barabanče (children's drum) -a heteroglot with a rhythmical function; a plaything. It is used to give the rhythm when children play soldiers or similar mar- ching games. Membranophones with a chord Bramčilo (pasteboard rattle) - a heteroglot; a plaything.The pasteboard rattle is made of a paper tube whose ends are covered with tightly stretched mem- branes made of thin paper. A horse-tail hair is knotted at one of its end and wound to the middle of one of the membranes.The other end of the hairis wound around a thin wooden stick.This stick has a groove which is rubbed with colophony. Turn- ing the tube causes the hair to rub over the groove. The vibrations generated in the hair are thus transmitted to the paper membrane and amplified by it and the tube.The sound of the pasteboard rattle resembles the buzz of an insect and has glissando characteristics. Membranophones combined with singing There are three types of membranophones belonging to this subgroup. The principle of sound alteration is the same with all of them. 72</page><page sequence="6">III. 2 A Strâk treva ("a blade of grass") B List ot kesten ("chestnut leaf") C Dârvesni lista ("leaves") 73</page><page sequence="7">Free kazoo - idioglot; a plaything. Holding tightly a piece of cigarette paper at both ends, the child presses his lips to the paper and sings. The paper alters the tone produced, thereby imparting a nasal timbre to it. A similar sound is produced when the child sings through a tube kazoo which is a heteroglot and represents a plaything, or when the cigarette paper is placed over a comb (also a heteroglot). Aerophones Free reeds Svirka funijka (cornet whistle) - heteroglot; made of wood; machine-made in a workshop.The vibrator of this whistle is a free reed on the principle of the mouth- organ. The cornet is made on a wood-turning lathe. A lamella with a free reed is fixed to the narrow end of the cornet. Only one tone is produced when the cornet is blown. Double cornet whistles are also made. Both types are used by children when they play games. This kind of instrument is found at markets or fairs. Whirling aerophones Bucalo (bull-roarer) - heteroglot; a plaything. A flat piece of metal or a simple ruler is wound at one end with a piece of string. When the ruler is swung, a whiz- zing sound with glissando characteristics is produced. The bull-roarer is one of the children's favourite playthings because it can be made without great effort. Vrânkalo (whirling disc) - heteroglot; a plaything. A disc is made of a piece of broken tile or a stone.Two holes are driven into its middle.The two ends of a string are passed through the holes and knotted to form a closed loop. The children hold the loop with the disc at both ends and swing the disc so that the loop of string becomes twisted. Putting both hands apart causes the string to unwind. These movements result in a whirl with glissando characteristics. This plaything can also be made of a button or any other round object with holes. Plosive aerophones Puškalo ot bâz ("pop gun made of elder branches") - heteroglot; a plaything (Illustration 3). A ball made of rope is placed in a hollow rod and pushed to the other end by means of a stick. A second ball is placed in the rod and pushed in the same manner. As a result of the compression formed inside the rod, the first ball pops out and produces an explosive sound. 74</page><page sequence="8">III. 3. Puškalo ot bâz. A plosive aerophone Wind instruments proper End-blown flutes Svirka (flute) - idioglot; musical instrument. The tone is produced when the player blows at an angle towards the sharp edge of the labial opening. The player's lips are formed in the same way as when whistling. The tone scale is major, diatonic, and the tone volume reaches two octaves.The tones from the first octave are produced by normal blowing and the tones from the second octave by means of overblowing. Flutes are generally made of wood, though there are flutes made of reed. Adults and older children use large flutes with a basic tone g from the first octave. Younger children use flutes whose basic tone is c from the second octave or d from the second octave. The melodies played are in relation to the children's age and musical ability. Flutes with internal duct Duduk (recorder) -heteroglot; musical instrument (Illustration 4).Similarto the svirka, the duduk has six fingerholes on its face. The tone scale and the tone volume are the same as those of the end-blown flute. Due to the simple blowing technique, it is very easy to play this instrument. Recorders with five fingerholes are specially made for the youngest children. Such instruments, which are actually playthings, do not have a fixed tone scale because of their very simple construction. Dvojanka (double recorder) - heteroglot; musical instrument with a bourdon tone. There is no difference between the recorder and the double recorder in the manner of tone producing as well as in the tone scale and tone volume.The prin- ciple difference between both instruments is that the double recorder is made of a wooden block in which two parallel bores are driven. One of the bores has six fingerholes while the other bore has only a side hole which lies in the same axis 75</page><page sequence="9">III. 4. A child playing a duduk (recorder) with the first fingerhole on the melody pipe.The bourdon pipe is tuned in unisono with the second tone of the melody pipe. Double recorders have different basic tones. For younger children the basic tone varies in the range c' d1, and e1. 76</page><page sequence="10">Stopped internal-duct pipes without fingerholes Vârbova pištjalka (willow whistle). Reedpipes Double reed aerophones Almost all musical instruments and musical playthings which belong to this group are made by children. These instruments and playthings belong to the sounding solids-instruments whose materials are taken from the natural envi- ronment. Svirka ot luk ("onion whistle") - primitive idioglot of seasonal non-durable cha- racter; a plaything.The children pick a stalk of green onion which actually consti- tutes a tubule and flatten the end at which they will blow in order to achieve the approximate shape of a double reed. When blowing the onion whistle, tones dif- fering in pitch can be produced. Bâzulka ("a whistle made of the stem of a pumpkin leaf") - idioglot of season- able, non-durable character; a plaything. A small slit is made into the stem of a pumpkin leaf. A longitudinal cut is made at the closed end, thus forming a struc- ture similar to the double reed. This whistle is usually made without fingerholes. Nevertheless, older children sometimes insert fingerholes in order to be able to produce more than one tone. The melodies played with the bazulka are usually simple improvisations. Piskun ot vârbova kora ("double reed of bark") - idioglot taken directly from the natural environment; non-durable; adapted; a plaything.The bark of a thin willow branch is removed very carefully so as to remain undamaged.The bark must form a narrow pipe and is then whitted with a knive at the end at which the child will blow so that a double reed is formed. Vârbov piskun s trâba ("a willow reed with a pipe") - heteroglot; a plaything, also called 'bur//a'or'zurna.'Children make a cone-shaped pipe from a spirally wound bark of a thick willow branch. The reed is placed in the narrow end intended for blowing. The tone produced is relatively strong and shepherd boys sometimes use the instrument for signalizing. 77</page><page sequence="11">III. 5. A gajdurka (chanter of a bagpipe) Single reed aerophones Raženi slamki (rye stems) - idioglot/heteroglot; children's musical instrument from the group of sounding solids-instru- ments taken directly from the natural environment; adapted. In the south-western part of Bulgaria, the rye stems are called 'piski,' while in all other parts they are known as 'gajdanici,' 'raženi slamki' or simply 'slamka.' Rye stems are usually pre- pared in July and August when rye becomes ripe. A section of a rye stem having two nodes is cut. A narrow tongue of the type 'katamonogloť (Becker 1966:79) is slit under the upper node which must be stopped. The rye stems for younger children do not have fingerholes. Older children supply the stems with up to six fingerholes cut along the length ofthestem.Thetone scale is major diatonic with a volume of up to one octave.To the rye stem with finger- holes, older children add a second stem without fingerholes. The latter produces a bourdon. In this way they achieve an effect very close to the bagpipe. Tuning of both rye stems - the melody and the bourdon ones - is performed by either cutting the bourdon stem short in case it sounds lower, or by inserting a blade of grass into it. Gajdurka -an instrument representing only the chanter of a bagpipe; heteroglot; musical instrument (Illustration 5). Chil- dren who wish to play the bagpipe start by learning to play this instrument first. It is mainly present in south-western Bul- garia where it is also called 'gajduk.' Blowing is performed directly into the reed. The gajdurka has seven fingerholes on its face and a single hole on its rear for the thumb. When the fingerholes are consecutively opened, a diatonic major tone scale with a volume from c1 to d1 Is produced. Additionally, two chromatic semitones can be produced through a combi- nation of the fingers. Due to the construction of the gajdurka, it is not possible to produce tones by overblowing. 78</page><page sequence="12">Vessel flutes with and without duct Čaška ot däbov žálád ("acorn's cup") - idioglot taken directly from the natural environment, not adapted; children's musical plaything (Illustration 6).The cup is placed between the forefinger and the third phalanx of the middle finger in such a manner as to allow blowing against its sharp edge. The tone has the characteris- tics of whistling. The tone is produced on the principle of the pan flute. III. 6. Čaška ot dâbov žálád, the "acorn's cup" held between the fingers Plodová kostilka ("fruit stone") - idioglot taken directly from the natural environ- ment, adapted; children's musical plaything. One end of an apricot stone is rubbed as long as necessary to form an opening big enough to remove the ker- nel. Similar to the pan flute, blowing is performed against the sharp edge. A single tone is produced. Glineni svirki (clay whistles) - idioglot; children's musical plaything. The clay whistles are made by manual modelling with special molds, or- in the case of the 79</page><page sequence="13">III. 1. A sound-producing instrument made of a thick hollow willow branch which is filled with water. ocarina - with a special potter's wheel. Except for the ocarina, all clay whistles have no fingerholes, i.e., they are able to produce only one tone. Afterforming and baking, the clay whistles are painted.They represent a variety of coloured musical playthings which, according to their shape and essence, can be grouped as fol- lows: - zoomorphic (little frogs, rabbits, cats, dogs, and horses); - ornitomorphic (ducks, roosters, birds, and storks); - anthropomorphic (ballerina); - combined forms (anthropozoomorphic) - (rider); - other forms (guns, airplanes). According to their purpose the clay whistles are - for girls (ballerina and certain ornitomorphic and zoomorphic forms); - for boys (mainly guns and airplanes). 80</page><page sequence="14">III. 8. Two carevična cigulka (maize fiddles) Okarina ("ocarina") - idioglot; musical in- strument. The ocarina is very popular in Bul- garia. Not only children but adults play this instrument. The ocarina is made in different sizes to conform to the children's capabili- ties. An ocarina with ten fingerholes has a tone volume of up to a decima. When a fin- ger combination is applied, the tone scale of the instrument becomes chromatic. Stomnička slavejče ("whistling water-pot 'nightingale'") - idioglot; a musical plaything. The name of the plaything is intended to emphasize the similarity to the warble of a nightingale. It is filled with water prior to playing. A modification of the whistling water-pot represents another musical plaything which is made of a thick willow branch and has the same musical effect (Illustration 7). Chordophones Carevična cigulka (maize fiddle) - idio- glot/heteroglot, taken directly from the natu- ral environment, adapted; a musical playth- ing (Illustration 8). Prior to playing, the nar- row strips - the 'strings' - are wetted. The tone is so weak that it can be heard only by the player. Instruments made on the model of certain traditional folk musical instruments, though reduced in size; or the traditional instru- ments themselves which can be played by older children are the gajda (bagpipe) and the gadulka (fiddle) (Illustration 9 and 10). 81</page><page sequence="15">▲ III. 9.

Dies rührt daher, daß keine der bisher aufgestellten Systematiken Musikinstrumente und Musikspielzeuge für Kinder als eine ge- trennt zu sehende Gruppe von Klangerzeugern benennt und es einem daher gestattet, diese Instrumente unter verschiedenen Gesichts- punkten zu untersuchen, z.B. unter dem Ge- sichtspunkt ihrerZweckbestimmung (Unterhal- tung von Säuglingen, Selbstunterhaltung von spielenden Kindern, Musizieren im engeren Sinne), dem ihrer musikalischen und konstruk- tiven Merkmale (musikalische Bedeutung, Art und Ursprung des schwingenden Materials, Konstruktion, Funktion) oder, indem man sich an Kriterien der Organologie und Ethnoorgano- logie hält. In dem Artikel wird auf die typischen Musikinstrumente und Musikspielzeuge bulga- rischer Kinder aus dem Blickwinkel der Organo- logie eingegangen: Sie werden in vier Gruppen als Idiophone, Membranophone, Aerophone und Chordophone vorgestellt. Aufmerksamkeit wird vor allem ihren Besonderheiten und ihrer Zweckbestimmung gewidmet. Vergilij Atanasov Les instruments de musique d'enfant et les jouets musicaux en Bulgarie (résumé) L'expression «instruments de musique d'en- fant» a une signification conditionnelle-explica- tive, qui provient du fait que ces instruments et les jouets musicaux ne figurent dans aucune des typologies scientifiques actuelles comme une catégorie distincte et différenciée. Ceci étant, il est possible d'examiner ces instru- ments sous différentes perspectives, par exemple en fonction de leurfinalité (amuserles bébés, être utilisés par les enfants dans leurs jeux, faire de la musique), de leurs caractéristi- ques musicales et physiques (signification mu- sicale, genre et origine du matériau vibrant, fa- brication, fonction), ou suivant les critères de l'organologie et de l'ethnoorganologie. Les ins- truments d'enfant et les jeux musicaux typi- ques pour la Bulgarie sont examinés dans cet article sous l'angle de l'organologie et présen- tés classés dans quatre groupes: idiophones, membranophones, aérophones et cordopho- nes. Une attention particulière est attachée à leurs caractéristiques et à leurs fonctions. 85</page></plain_text>
