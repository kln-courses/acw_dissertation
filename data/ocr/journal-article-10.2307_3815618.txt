LaFleur I see the hard, round, whole substance of pain splinter and crack into everything there is,l Religion at a low temperature A mong the major religions Buddhism has long tolerated, sometimes even encouraged, an agnostic approach in unexpected areas, On certain questions deemed essential by the monotheistic faiths and about which they have claimed to have data from highly placed sources, the earliest Buddhists maintained what was, at least by their own lights, a principled silence. The existence of deity, the origins of the universe, and like matters constituted, for them, questions deemed unanswer- able - due not only to scanty data but also because such questions tend to distract humans from attention to the problem of suffering. And it is not unheard of for Buddhists themselves to express skepticism about traditional ideas once taken to be core tenets of the tradition - karma, for instance.2 Although in recent films such as Bertolucci's Uttfe Buddha karmic rebirth is taken as a staple of Buddhism and a belief which - somewhat conveniently - gives a metaphysi- cal scope to the technique of the 'flashback', such a concept, say some, may not really be an essential of Buddhism after all. Buddhism in this form would seem to be a clear example of what A.N. Whitehead in 1927 called 'religion at a very low temperature'. His point, how- ever, was what might be 'low' should not be misiden- tified as 'out'. Because we may be far more accustomed to the more high temp prophetic modes of religion, we may need to retrain ourselves to be able to see and feel what is religious about less overt modes. Such an effort may be especially needed in contexts, primarily Japanese, where an aesthetic has been shaped by the Zen form of Buddhism to provide something unusually interesting - even if also very elusive. This is so because already in China Bud- dhists following this particular trajectory had often turned the possession of non-knowledge into some- thing of a virtue, gaining thereby respect from some, The tomes of both Chinese and Japanese Zen rel- ished the skeptical mode. They are full of accounts of masters resistant to the use of religious language and turning away piety as merely a version of pre- tence. Sakyamuni's silence and Kasyapa's enigmatic smile, parts of the foundation story for Zen as a school, have been a peculiar goad to anyone wanting to articulate how this low temp religion became a cultural and aesthetic style in Japan, one also likely to be a feature of certain films. This is a piety which, if not perverse, is at least inverse: it gets expressed through diffidence and disclaimers concerning its very existence. And this surely presents an obvious problem to anyone hoping to express what might be meaningful in acts of silence. To articulate the norm threatens, by definition, to violate it. Knowing this while at the same time attempting to work around it is to me one of the most interesting things about Donald Richie's classic study of Yasujiro Ozu. In an William R. LaFleur is the E.

But he knew Ozu would have laughed off the very sugges- tion. '[Ozu] himself never spoke of mu, or mono no aware, though he knew what they meant, and I doubt he would ever have seriously discussed them.'3 Nev- ertheless, Richie noted that Ozu had his ashes buried at a Zen temple in Kamakura and that the graph mu engraved on his tombstone suggests 'the nothing that, in Zen philosophy, is everything'.4 Paradoxical in this is the move toward affirma- tion by way of negation. In this mode of being relig- ious the old minimalist dictum holds true: To say less is to say more. A primary teaching of Buddhism had been that all things and beings are impermanent. Thus, our attempts to 'comprehend' them - since these involve prehendere or grasping by the mind - will ultimately both fail and court futility. Initially this comes across as a negative: the impermanence that is the prime feature of things (mono) forces limits on our capacity to know them fully. Just as we cannot physically hold in place or in stasis that which is passing away, so too we cannot hold in mind that which ultimately runs far beyond our mental grasp. But the flip-side of this limitation is positive. The fact that even ordinary things and persons cannot be fully grasped implies their capacity to elude the limi- tation that our holding efforts would place upon them. The myriad ways in which phenomena interpenetrate implies that they can serve as apertures through which we can glimpse something of the vast network - sometimes called 'Indra's net' - of the universe. And for Buddhists, awe vis-a-vis phenomena is awe and 'transcendence' enough. Mu is the negation that is 'everything', the denial of certainty that opens out into the 'mysteriousness in things' (mono no aware). Mu as a word on Ozu's tombstone suggests that it may also be a key feature of his films. If awe is a posture of the mind, it is also one the body should be expected to articulate. Silences, taciturnity, or even mumbled inanities can characterise the tongue in times of reverie.5 And the nearly quiescent, sitting body - especially when complemented by the fa- mously 'sitting' camera of Ozu - is the apt corporeal mode, one perhaps so enculturated in Japan that an overt reference to it seems hardly necessary to most Japanese.6 Richie explains how conversational hia- tuses operate both in the psychology and aesthetics of Ozu's films: 'They tell us that Ozu characters are people capable of sitting back, of being contempla- tive'.7 But it is important to note that the cinemato- graphic techniques were of one piece with that director's core philosophy: ... Ozu usually prefers to break rather than resolve, at least in the middle of his films. An unavoidable inference is that the weather, na- ture, the world that exists outside man and his petty concerns, is much wider, much more mysterious, than we usually think.8 This in a most literal sense becomes how the world is viewed. My ambition here is that this is very much like what is often going on in films made by Hirokazu Kore'eda and especially in his 1998 Maborosi. Fre- quently compared to Ozu, Kore'eda also makes films that open forward into an attitude of awe before the immensity and miysteriousness of the universe and all the particulars within it. in Maborosi too the unmov- ing camera induces a stance of contemplation, one which respects and relishes what may forever remain unknown in things. The stance is one that becomes satisfied with no needing to 'break through' the world of phenomena to locate some entity, some God, or some Being which lies somehow beyond the penum- bra of the known. Yumiko's search Kore'eda, who is more concerned about plot than Ozu had been, also invests more effort in a deliberate undermining of intellectual obstacles to such a vision of the world. He insists that we see what is deeply inexplicable about our universe and our lives and tries to facilitate that by a certain amount of ground- clearing. In Maborosi this matter is focused through the problem of suicide and specifically whether or not it is something which can ever be adequately com- prehended by others. To be sure, they make sus- tained efforts to grasp it. It can become an obsession. As the heroine of Maborosi states near the film's end, her first husband's death had been a matter 'going round and round in [her] head'. But the film strongly suggests that such efforts cannot ulti- mately succeed. What, therefore, might be the 'religious' dimen- sion of such a film consists not in doctrinal reso- nances but in how the film itself, both in its narrative and in its cinematic techniques, accommodates to the deep incomprehensibility of events and, beyond 159</page><page sequence="3">160 William R. LaFleur that, adumbrates the mysteriousness of the world itself. The narrative moves in the direction of showing that even in the case of suicide we do well to recog- nise not only something tragic - that is, the usual approach - but also something finally inexplicable and, to that extent, awesome. But to take up this theme and to value it in such terms constituted a bold and unconventional move on the part of a director. Here I try to pursue the question of why this is so important but at the same time recognise what my close focus leaves unsaid about this rich film. I note that elsewhere Keiko McDonald has provided an analysis of Maborosi that is so attuned to the subtle- ties of its plot and so attentive to its details that any effort of mine to do the same would be both redun- dant and embarrassingly inadequate by compari- son.9 The plot of Maborosi moves on an axis - away from the urban life of the young and happily married Yumiko, through the tragedy of her husband's totally unanticipated suicide under a train, and her sub- sequent move into a new marriage, one that means she henceforth will live in a rural seacoast commu- nity. Through most of the film that is where she lives but the domestic happiness she eventually comes to know there is always qualified by the question that cannot leave her mind - namely, that of the reason for her first husband's death. By the film's denoue- ment it has become her obsession. Maborosi is a film whose core tension depends in part on a contrast between an ever widening visual spaciousness on screen and what we cannot avoid perceiving as the protagonist's narrowly focused mind. If the external world is wide and free, the ambit of the principal character's mind is tight and con- stricted. The unresolved problem makes it so. Our insight into the pain of Yumiko is sharpened by a perceptible contrast between what we gather con- cerning her inner life and the expansive landscape of sea, fields and sky - a landscape to which the cam- era of Kore'eda is so attentive that it becomes a part of the philosophy of this film. Met and driven to her rural home by Tamio, her second husband. Yumiko seems aghast to see that the sea is so vast. This theme gets reiterated in a later scene where her own child and that of her second husband are at play together in rice-fields. A high-angle shot catches them as small figures next to an endless sea and on a fragile strip of land running next to ricefields that themselves exquisitely mirror the expanse of the sky above. On the road going there one child remarks that the scope of the land is wide and then the other responds, saying that the ocean is even more vast. Yet, importantly, these are not shots that in any way reduce the humans by juxtaposing them to what might be the physical world's capacity to terrorise by virtue of its immensity. Humans are not rendered minuscule; that part of Rudolph Otto's mysterium Fig. 1. Children playing between sky and rice-field. [All illustrations from Maborosi (Hirokazu Kore'eda, 1998).] :1 1:.

Even the ocean, audibly and endlessly roaring, is not ever presented as somehow 'indifferent' since even that approach, a favourite of Naturalism in the arts, lays down an anthropomorphic attempt at 'comprehension' whereas what interests Kore'eda's camera takes in a nature that is neither hostile nor friendly. It is a nature that just is. And as long as it is so, the manner in which it slides out beyond the epistemic grasp yields what about it is wondrous. The truly meditative stance refrains from writing melodrama over the phe- nomena of nature. And this, I suggest, is the Ozu- esque stance. What we know about the inner life of Yumiko, however, is that it remains fixed, even at times ob- sessed, with trying to understand the suicide of Ikuo. This mind and this preoccupation cannot avoid being also those of any viewer of Maborosi. He or she is never given privileged access to any information about that death. And, thus, Yumiko's central preoc- cupation is necessarily that of the viewer as well. If anything, the searched for reason for Ikuo's suicide becomes increasingly more obscure, more unattain- able as the story moves forward. Well into the narra- tive we learn, when Yumiko does, that Ikuo's state of mind during the hours just prior to his death had not shown even a trace of the mentality we ordinarily describe as 'suicidal'. What is remarkable about this film is that it is not one whose narrative tension will be relieved in the end by the provision of some missing datum that makes for 'resolution'. On the contrary, Kore'eda's design is to show that Ikuo's death, perhaps to illustrate something about all sui- cides, will remain a deeply incomprehensible one. Kore'eda has intended to deprive us of the various ways in which we, notably in the modern era, are accustomed to thinking that we might be able to uncover the exact cause or causes of an act of suicide. Most explicit about wanting to take away what we think of as a socio-economic explanation, he writes: What I wanted to do [in Maborosi] is explore the sense of loss that one woman carried within her, independent of the poverty of the time or even her own poverty. I thought that way I would achieve a pure portrayal of that loss. For my generation ... there is a feeling of a lack of certainty about anything - a universal undefined feeling of loss.10 Kore'eda states that it was his intention to undercut the way in which an older contemporary, Kohei Oguri, had suggested in film that suicide is explicable - namely, that once the conditions of poverty or deprivation are presented, an audience will know why someone chose death. It seems clear that Kore'eda denied any suggestion of material deprivation in the lives of Yumiko and Ikuo when the latter went under the wheels of a speeding train. The collapse of explanatory adequacy, how- ever, goes on. Also taken away is the likelihood of psycho-pathological motivation. Through much of the film Yumiko appears to wonder whether some kind of deep depression, one that Ikuo had hidden from her, had in fact been present and had pressed him to a breaking point. This lurking possibility, how- ever, gets emphatically discarded once Yumiko re- turns to the urban site of her former life for a visit and there learns that Ikuo had been anything but de- pressed on the day of his death. From the coffee-bar proprietor who had seen him just prior to the suicide, she finds that Ikuo had been upbeat, showing none of the signs of a condition that could be clinically defined as 'suicidal'."1 Thus, neither poverty nor pa- thology - that is, probably the 20th century's two favoured justifications - were able, according to this director, to bring about a satisfactory explanation for suicide. At least they fail to do so for what Kore'eda, significantly, calls 'his generation'.12 And he surely knew he was moving against the stream - something shown in his statement: 'I really don't think it's bad for people to be attracted to the idea of death or loss, or to portray it, or to approach it, or to measure one's distance from it'. Important to note about Maborosi, however, is that its director does not offer yet another theory as to what might push an individual into a voluntary death. Instead, he employs a complex play with light to provide a viewer of this film with his or her own experience of being attracted toward some context which, however opaquely, promises to provide some intense epiphany of things. Via this film the trajectory toward suicide is not so much theorised as it is rehearsed. What is unique in this becomes clear when we realise that our usual way of explaining suicide is in terms of what conditions or experience might possibly have been pushing an individual to- ward it. All such theories assume that being alive as an individual is so obviously preferable to dying that it would require an immense amount of force - social, psychological, ideological, or whatever - to push someone to make the opposite judgement and then 161</page><page sequence="5">William R. LaFleur act upon it. What we mean by the 'breaking point' is the arrival at that point of view and readiness to implement it. All our existing explanations of this process attempt to pinpoint what it is that exerts such a level of pressure. And they assume that, since death by a person's own hand is an unqualified negative and an act with no redeeming features, to remove the conditions that might propel someone toward it must be unqualifiedly positive. Kore'eda invites skepticism towards precisely that supposition. This is the import of what he says explicitly about how he differs from Kohei Oguri and implicitly about how his own 'generation' differs from its close predecessors. Maborosi, consequently, does not offer yet another theory as to what might be the push away from this world. Rather, via the tech- niques of film itself, it draws a viewer into his or her own experience of what it might feel like to be at- tracted to the moment of dying. Commenting that it need not be 'bad for people to be attracted to the idea of death', Kore'eda raises a profound question about the correctness and adequacy of what had been the core presupposition in all theories of suicide favoured within the modern epoch. But just to raise the possibility that there might be something pro- foundlyattractive in death is to lay emphasis not upon the condition of being dead but upon the experience of dying, one which, however fleeting, is held out as possibly providing an absolutely unparalleled expe- rience of being connected to the panoply of things. Although to the bulk of mankind the price paid is far too much, Kore'eda suggests that for some individu- als it is not so. For them the resultant state of being dead does not itself cancel out the value of what might be had in the experience of voluntary dying. To take this point of new is to revive the contention of Yasunari Kawabata, himself later a suicide, offered at the time of his reception of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1968. It was that the person who con- sciously and intentionally dies has an unparalleled view of things in their awesomeness. Kawabata re- ferred to it as a point of connecting with this world with 'eyes that see it for the last time' (matsugo no me). Seductive light and celluloid trains Kore'eda does not, however, refer to Kawabata. In- stead he builds into his film something with prece- dent in a body of religious lore handed down from Japan's medieval period. His narrative makes such a connection near the film's end and it comes when Yumiko had returned from her excursion to her for- mer home in the city and had learned there that Ikuo had killed himself for no explicable reason. At this point in the film she is finally and totally bereft of explanations. There had been no 'sense' in Ikuo's suicide. And she is distraught to a degree not seen before. She takes sudden leave of her usual domes- Fig. 2. Yumiko, Tamio and the pyre at the edge of the sea. 162</page><page sequence="6">Suicide off the edge of explicability: awe in Ozu and Kore'eda tic responsibilities and journeys by bus to a location further removed and by the sea. What follows is a sequence widely recognised by critics as one of extraordinary cinematic beauty. Before a lens posi- tioned in some high location snowflakes appear and then fall with a gradual increase in their rate and volume. In the distance a corpse-bearing group of mourners wends its way slowly out the shore's edge. Next we see Yumiko at a later point and deeply disconsolate, standing alone in protracted fixation on the burning list of the pyre on that strand. Tamio, the man to whom she has now been married for some years while living far from the city, has searched her out and travelled by car to find her alone and by the sea. When she tearfully blurts out to him her inability to grasp why her first husband had chosen to die, Tamio tells her that a mysterious and beautiful light can sometimes appear in the distance, so alluringly that individuals entranced by it may become willing to die just in order to do so. His own fisherman father, Tamio says, had once seen such a seductive light out over the sea. This light is the maborosi of the film's title, a phantasmagorical kind of light or maboroshi no hikari of the original. But there is a profoundly important allusion operative at this point of the film, one easily missed by critics. That is, what Tamio's father had reputedly seen out at sea was something to which Japanese Buddhist writings had referred with some regularity already in the medieval period. And the reference is much more than a bit of arcane trivia. Beginning at least as early as 868 and with examples recorded as late as 1722 there had been within Japan a practice, the Fudaraku-tokai, according to which certain Buddhist holy-men would set out to sea in boats supposedly destined to reach Potalaka [Fudaraku], a paradisal location.13 Potalaka was as- sumed then to be the abode, an intensely luminous one, of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Avalokites- vara (Kuan-yin to the Chinese and Kannon to the Japanese).14 Medieval and early modern Japanese texts tell of a sequence of persons, often prompted by sights or reports of wondrous light emitted by the distant Potalaka, sailing off, never returning, and assumed by others to have died. Departure dates were often well announced and crowds would gather at the sea's edge to see such persons off and to marvel at such acts of faith and fervor. And, we gather, there was a desire to be on hand just in case of a last-m- inute weakness of will and an embarrassing trip-can- cellation. In a 1961 short-story translated as 'Passage to Fudaraku', the late Yasushi Inoue, Ja- pan's premier writer of historical fiction, recapitulated this narrative tradition in modern prose and for a wide readership.15 Within Maborosi there is a powerful functional analogue to the Potalaka's alluring light out at sea. It Fig. 3. Ikuo fascinated by the lights of a passing train. 163</page><page sequence="7">William R. LaFleur is the glittering stream of passenger train windows that move through the night and through the urban locale that is the home of the newly married Ikuo and Yumiko. The film as a whole, of course, is a medley of chiaroscuro. But to take note of that feature and then either praise it as a reason for its beauty or censure it for photoludic overkill is to miss what is unique in Maborosi. And that consists in Kore'eda's skill in taking what humans know to be inherently fascinating about light, intensifying its allure to the point of letting it become an invitation to dying to a degree that begins to approximate Potalaka's mag- netism, and then positioning these complex dynam- ics within the film's narrative in an explicit way. Moreover, Maborosi raises to a new level what it can mean for a viewer to be stitched into a film. Coordi- nated with how the plot infoms us that the elegant luminosity of a passing train had sucked Ikuo into its path is the film's own incessant but fascinating play with lights and luminosity. This means that the viewer of the film, however likely to be resistant to the idea of there being nothing necessarily 'bad' about sui- cide, will within the course of viewing this film have, at least in all likelihood, an intense experience of the seductive power of light. Kore'eda, that is, has structured this film so that any possible 'understanding' of Ikuo's seem- ingly irrational act will come, not through some new and alternative theory about a suicide's likely cause but, rather, via its having forced upon us viewers an awareness that, yes, we too could find ourselves caught in the powerful grip of an amazing, alluring play of light. We too are given at least a taste of the fascination that pulled Ikuo in. During the course of nearly two hours we not only become conscious that lights and lamps of all kinds feature strongly in Maborosi but have also begun to anticipate and even relish every new one. The forge of a steel mill, the lights at street corners, a kitchen gas lamp, shafts of light falling on a staircase, and then surely the funeral pyre's flame rising up against the dark ocean - all these had formed a pattern of fascination. And they collectively merged into the light that is at the core of the film's plot - namely, that of the glittering windows of a train rushing through the night. For even if we cannot in the end claim to have a single intelligible reason for Ikuo's death, we will have willy-nilly be- come complicit in its dynamic. We will have tasted something of what Kawabata referred to as seeing the world with matsugo no me. The beauty of such lights had registered not just on our retinas but also in some interior place where we ordinarily would have expected to find nothing but.resistance to the idea of suicide. Thus, even if our conscious minds cannot locate an adequate explanation for something as 'irrational' as Ikuo's suicide, this film as experienced suggests otherwise. The beauty of a world so seen becomes also the beauty of cinema itself. Kore'eda forges this recognition in a way that is unique. The lights of the train drawing Ikuo to itself come to be tied closely to what this film reflexively says about what film itself can do. The tie-in comes early in the narrative. Ikuo and his bicycle have stopped at a railroad crossing in the city. Now himself a stilled spectator, he stands quietly as the segmented but light-drenched windows of the multiple passenger cars flicker past in a manner not at all unlike the way in which the sequential frames of a strip of light-backed celluloid, if slowed, will move before a viewer's eyes. The train itself has become a filament of film - and one of startling beauty. And if Ikuo in this scene has become the 'out in front' representative of us who at that precise time are viewing this film, then he also, by implication at least, has become - by the way in which this suturing and the plot itself coalesce - someone who is merely 'out in front' of the rest of us in terms of knowing what might be attractive in the experience of dying. That is, the moment of being transfixed is also one of uncommon beauty. The passing train becomes an aperture into the passing nature of the world. Dying and seeing come together. What moves before the eyes moves away most certainly, but not without first being a sequence of otherwise unattainable beauty.

Initial explanations of the clearly suicidal actions of some of that group's members were focused on the concept 'brain-washing' (n6sen).
