Susan Denyer has attempted the impossible, and to some extent she has succeeded. Her survey covers the traditional architecture of sub-Saharan African in a systematic, even- handed way that has never before been achieved, making the book useful for the in- struction of students as well as edifying for the general reader. Her approach is basically that of an economic geographer and aesthetic considerations are sparse, but the abundance of visual material is a delight to the eye. Ms. Denyer has organized her book into ten chapters, each of which is followed by a sec- tion of illustrations. She begins with a discus- sion of climatic factors, then moves to rural settlement patterns, states and towns.

There follow sections on defense, the building process, and decoration. The three final sections, one on a taxonomy of house forms, another on the distribution of styles, and a concluding discussion of the im- pact of modernization, constitute the most controversial areas of investigation. Denyer defines 32 house types on the basis of form, citing widely dispersed examples. This typol- ogy is far larger than those proposed by Frobenius, Labouret, Glick, or Prussin, and it seems rather particularistic. But who am I to question the thrust of British empiricism? The matter of style distribution is handled similarly. Denyer discusses the so-called Sudanese, impluvial, hill, and beehive styles; she disagrees with Prussin's hypothesis in the first instance (i.e., that Manding-dispersed mud-brick technology accounts for the Sudanese style), seeing the tradition as a re- sult of urbanism instead. Her remarks on the other "styles" are equally interesting, even if somewhat heavily weighted on the geog- rapher's environmental-adaptation side. Similar thoughtfulness characterizes the final section on the impact of modernization. The weaknesses of Denyer's approach have already been pointed out by Paul Oliver in his review in RAIN. By confining herself largely to formal criteria, she obliterates differences in structure due to technology. Even more important, the social dimension, which is cru- cial to all architecture, tends to diminish or vanish by default. In addition, by eschewing almost entirely a theoretical framework, De- nyer denies herself the opportunity of making discoveries (or meaningful mistakes). She does not mention Julius Glhick's article on Af- rican architecture, for example, despite the existence of two translations in anthologies. Right or wrong, Glhick should be dealt with, as should other theoretical positions. The crit- ical apparatus of African Traditional Architec- ture also leaves much to be desired. Drawings redone from Walton, Frobenius, L'habitat au Cameroun, etc., are credited merely to Denyer, making it difficult for the novice to retrace her steps. Finally, I looked in vain for an analysis of the prevailing anthropomorphism of Af- rican architecture, a humanistic consideration at least as important as all the taxonomies in the world.
