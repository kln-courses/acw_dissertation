In the present study, which consists of an introduction and three main parts, we are concerned with the elements which serve as the artistic material of Recent Style poetry, namely, words and sentences. How these elements are organized into a unified whole in individual poems is a question that we will take up in a subsequent study. In manuals on poetry, the topics we are about to discuss would come under the headings of diction, syntax, and imagery. But in order to highlight the influence of diction and syntax on image making, we have chosen to treat these topics not in the customary serial order but simultaneously. Thus in all three divisions of this study, we will be concerned with questions such as these: In which part of a poem do lines of a certain type usually occur? What is the function of that type of line, to make isolated images or to unify them? What kind of image does it make, static or dynamic? How do syntax and diction affect the presence or absence of imagery in a line? How do they make different kinds of images? The reason for dividing this study into three parts will be explained in the Introduction. But the Introduction also serves another pur- pose: it is actually a self-contained miniature study, in which we attempt to outline the main ideas of this study and the subsequent one. For each idea, we have chosen a spokesman; they are T. E. Hulme, Ernest Fenollosa, Susanne Langer, and Ernst Cassirer. We do not always agree with them. These spokesmen were chosen because they sometimes took extreme positions on an issue, and were thus able to give the most forceful expression of a seminal idea. 1 This article is part of a larger work on Recent Style poetry. The authors wish to thank the Regional Studies Committee of Princeton University, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the East Asia Research Center of Harvard University for financial support which made the writing of this paper possible. 51</page><page sequence="4">52 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN While the subject matter of our inquiry is T'ang poetry, there are, in a certain sense, only individual poems but no poetry as such. In other words, when we consider the elements of Recent Style poetry, we are taking words and sentences out of their natural environment. To remedy this unavoidable artificiality, we will give a detailed analysis of Tu Fu's "Yangtze and Han" in the Introduction. The purpose is both to illustrate how the ideas of Hulme, Fenollosa, Langer, and Cassirer are applied, and to show how the words and sentences func- tion together in an organic unity of an individual poem. When an example is followed by a number in parentheses, e.g., IE3 l* 1 (425), the number 425 refers to the page number in the 1959 Chung-hua edition of Kao Pu-ying's Anthology of T'ang and Sung Poetry r J If an example does not appear in Kao's anthology, then its reference will have this form: "CTS, 246", where CTS stands for 4. Complete T'ang Poems and the page number refers to the 1960 Peking edition. At the end, there is a table which converts the page number of Kao's anthology to CTS, together with names of authors. No reference is given for the more familiar poems in the T'ang-shih san-pai shou. Each example is followed by its English equivalent. We have tried to be as literal as possible, especially in those places where a literal equivalent is necessary for our argument, even though in pursuit of this aim, we have sometimes concocted expressions which are not immediately intelligible. 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Isolating Syntax In his Articulate Energy, Donald Davie discussed three theories of syntax. The first theory, which views syntax as unpoetic, is repre- sented by T. E. Hulme. In prose as in algebra concrete things are embodied in signs or counters which are moved about according to rules, without being visualized at all in the process.... One only changes the Xs and the Ys back into physical things at the end of the process. Poetry, in one aspect at any rate, may be considered as the effort to avoid this characteristic of prose. It is not a counter language, but a visual concrete one. It is a compronlise for a lan- guage of intuition which would hand over sensation bodily. It always en- deavours to arrest you, and to make you continuously see a physical thing,</page><page sequence="5">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 53 to prevent you gliding through an abstract process. It chooses fresh epithets and fresh metaphors, not so much because they are new, and we are tired of the old, but because the old cease to convey a physical thing and become abstract counters. ... Images in verse are not mere decoration, but the very essence of an intuitive language. Verse is a pedestrian taking you over the ground, prose-a train which delivers you at a destination. (Davie, p. 5; from Hulme, Speculations, pp. 134-135) Stated in less metaphoric terms, Hulme's idea seems to be this. In prose, words are organized by syntax into units of increasing com- plexity. Words are thus primarily related to other words, only sec- ondarily to physical things. The forward momentum generated by syntax also hurries us from the beginning of a sentence to its end, and from one sentence to the next, thus turning reading into an abstract process. Poetry is concerned with intuition, not abstraction. Its busi- ness is to make us continuously see physical things, and this it does by making visually concrete images and by adopting a much slower pace. Since syntax has exactly the opposite effect, it follows that syntax is unpoetic. The remedy is to abolish syntax altogether, and when that ideal state is attained, we get the kind of poetry exemplified by Ezra Pound's "In a Station of the Metro," namely Imagist poetry. The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough. Here the syntax is minimal, the image is static, and the vehicle, in both instances, is a noun phrase. A similar situation obtains in the first two lines of Chang Chi's "Mooring by the Maple Bridge at Night." J]s'! .1% Z rj) / as AiA lit w The moon sets, a raven cries, frost fills the sky River maples, fishermen's lanterns,-facing sadness I lie. These lines fulfill Hulme's ideal of minimal syntax in that they con- sist of six short units in succession, with no linkage of any kind from one to the next. Especially noteworthy are "river maples" and "fish- ermen's lanterns," two nouns standing in complete isolation, each of which conveys a concrete visual impression. In this respect they are similar to "petals on a wet, black bough." The preceding suggests a general question: Under what conditions</page><page sequence="6">54 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN does a noun or a noun phrase achieve isolation and thus become the vehicle of a simple image? This is one of the questions we shall be concerned with in this study. 1.2 Syntax as Action The second theory, which views syntax as action, is represented by Fenollosa. All truth has to be expressed in sentences because all truth is the trans- ference of power. The type of sentence in nature is a flash of lightning. It passes between two terms, a cloud and the earth. No unit of natural process can be less than this. All natural processes are, in their units, as much as this. Light, heat, gravity, chemical affinity, human will, have this in com- mon, that they redistribute force. Their unit of process can be represented as: term transference term from of to which force which If we regard this transference as the conscious or unconscious act of an agent we can translate the diagram into: agent act object In this the act is the very substance of the fact denoted. The agent and the object are only limiting terms. It seems to me that the normal and typical sentence in English as well in Chinese expresses just this unit of natural process. It consists of three necessary words: the first denoting the agent or subject from which the act starts, the second embodying the very stroke of the act, the third pointing to the object, the receiver of the impact. Thus: Farmer pound rice The form of the Chinese transitive sentence, and of the English (omitting particles), exactly corresponds to this universal form of action in nature. This brings language close to things, and its strong reliance upon verbs it erects all speech into a kind of dramatic poetry. (Davie, p. 36; from Fenol- losa, "The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry") It is interesting to note that these two theories are apparently opposed to each other. Hulme would banish syntax from poetry; Fenollosa sets great store by it. Hulme's program, when first put into practice by Ezra Pound, emphasizes the static quality of physical things; Fenol- losa is preoccupied with the dynamic process in nature. Fenollosa went on to say that the "unpoetic" intransitive verbs in English should in poetry be made transitive, wherever possible. This in fact is often the practice in Chinese poetry, for example, in this</page><page sequence="7">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 55 famous line by Wang An-shih, from the poem "Mooring at Kua-chou" Spring wind again greens Yangtze's southern shore The word translated as "greens" is a causative verb, that is, a stative verb used transitively; it is an unfortunate accident of English that we can say "to whiten," "to blacken," but not "to greenen"; an "un- poetic" form of the sentence would be "Spring wind again causes Yangtze's southern shore to green." As the line stands, its word order does conform to Fenollosa's prescription, namely, agent-act- object. Let us also note that "greens" at once embodies the act and the vivid quality of its consequence, which is Hulme and Fenollosa rolled into one. This calls for a revision in Fenollosa's theory; his analysis of causal action needs to be expanded to include four terms: agent, "spring"; act, the position occupied by "greens"; object, "Yangtze's southern shore"; consequence, the quality of "greens." A second revision is also in order. Fenollosa emphasized the concept of causa- tion, but neglected the allied concept of time and change. In the above example, time is not only implied by causal action, but also emphasized by the temporal adverb, "again": "Spring wind again greens Yangtze's southern shore." Furthermore, the line already cited The moon sets, a raven cries, frost fills the sky conveys temporariness, just as "river maples, fishermen's lanterns" suggests coextension in space. Change the line to The setting moon, a crying raven, the frost-filled sky and the temporal dimension drops out entirely. From this we see that the intransitive sentence, though deemed "unpoetic" by Fenollosa, also has a worthy place in poetry. Our purpose in discussing Fenollosa is not to discredit him, but rather to highlight a problem he suggested: How is the dynamic image made in poetry? This is another question which we will be concerned with in this study. It is also clear that the contradiction between Hulme and Fenollosa is more apparent than real; the static and the dynamic are sometimes evoked in different parts of a poem, for example, the first and the second line of Chang Chi's poem; the</page><page sequence="8">56 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN same line nlay be visually concrete and at the same time reproduce, via its form, the transference of power in nature, for example, Wang An-shih's line. 1.3 Unifying Syntax The third theory, which views syntax as music, is represented by Susanne Langer. Though the material of poetry is verbal, its import is not the literal asser- tion made in the words, but the way the assertion is made, and this involves the sound, the tempo, the aura of associations of words, the long or short sequences of ideas, the wealth or poverty of transient imagery that contains them, the sudden arrest of fantasy by pure fact, or of familiar fact by sudden fantasy, the suspense of literal meaning by a sustained ambiguity resolved in a long-awaited key-word, and the unifying all-embracing artifice of rhythm. (Davie, p. 18; from Langer, Philosophy in a New Key, pp. 260-261) The operative clause here is "the unifying, all-embracing artifice of rhythm." This emphasis on unification is in direct contrast with Hulme's theory which focuses on fragmentary images and their un- derlying basis, namely, isolating syntax. Elsewhere she says, "All music creates an order of virtual time, in which its sonorous forms move in relation to each other-always and only to each other, for nothing else exists there" (Form and Feeling, p. 1og). Now, although Langer nowhere says it explicitly, she would probably agree that poetry is like music in two essential aspects. First, it is formal or contains strongly formal elements. Just as sonorous forms move in relation to each other in music, linguistic units, as organized by syntax and prosody, move in relation to each other in verbal art. Secondly, poetry also creates an order of virtual time, and this it does by varying the size and complexity of verbal units, and by imposing upon them an overall organization. The following poem by Tu Fu illustrates Langer's "unifying, all-embracing artifice of rhythm" and the role syntax plays in generating this rhythm. Yangtze and Han W Ha .CX / 91 kJ4 (491 t#tW / T'ttJiR (491)</page><page sequence="9">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 57 Yangtze-Han, think-return stranger / Ch'ien-K'un, one withered pedant Patch-cloud, heaven with far / Eternal-night, moon together alone Setting-sun, heart still hale / Autumn-wind, sickness about-to revive Antiquity since keep old horse / no need take long road By Yangtze and Han, a stranger who thinks of home, One withered pedant between the Ch'ien and K'un Under as far a sky as that streak of cloud, The moon in the endless night no more alone. In sunset hale of heart still: In the autumn wind, risen from sickness. There's always a place kept for an old horse Though it can take no more to the long road.2 The syntax of this poem progresses from the least continuous to the most continuous. Lines 1 and 2 each consist of two noun phrases in juxtaposition, with no linkage of any kind in between. Lines 3 and 4 have some syntactic linkages; t'ien kung and yiieh t'ung are coverbal phrases; and each line has an attributive predicate, yiian or ku, which naturally attaches to the subject. But the syntax is scrambled; the coverb should normally precede its object-that is, kung t'ien and t'ung yiieh-but in this case the order is reversed.3 The meaning of these lines is ambiguous; line 3 hovers between "ethe streak of cloud is as far as the sky," and "under the sky, I am as far (and away from home) as the streak of cloud"; line 4 between "the eternal night shares (its) loneliness with the moon," and "in the eternal night, I and the moon are together alone." Scrambled syntax and ambiguous meaning together impede the natural flow. Lines 5 and 6 suffer no distortion of word order and thus exemplify the kind of continuity customary for five-syllable lines. Lines 7 and 8 are most continuous for two reasons. Whereas all three preceding pairs are in parallel or pseudoparallel construction-and parallelism always recycles the syntactic flow backwards onto itself- the last two lines are not. They are also run-on lines; "old horse" is both the object of line 7 and the subject of line 8. Thus within the compass of four pairs, just about all the gradations between extreme 2 A. C. Graham's translation in Poems of the Late T'ang (Baltimore, 1965), p. 48. 3 See ITJJ, " (Shanghai, 1964), p. 182 and p. 256 for a discussion of the syntax of these lines.</page><page sequence="10">58 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN discontinuity and extreme continuity are illustrated, and the pro- gression in rhythmic pace is accomplished by syntax. 1.4 Preview of Some Basic Ideas This poem illustrates another kind of progression which runs par- allel to the one just discussed. As the poem proceeds there is a de- crease in imagistic impact correlative to an increase in propositional force. Lines 1 and 2, separately and together, present the image of a homesick traveller, an insignificant figure lost in the vastness of the universe. This picture continues into lines 3 and 4, where a streak of cloud in the far-away sky and the moon of the eternal night alone keep company with the solitary man. In a sense that will soon be made clear, lines 1 to 4 derive much of their power from the contrast in the qualities of their simple images, that is, the vastness of "eternal night" and "sky" and the smallness of "moon" and "streak of cloud." Lines 5 and 6 contain two much weaker simple images ("setting sun" and "autumn wind"), but they begin to assert whereas the preceding lines only describe. Lines 7 and 8 clearly state a proposition, "There is always a place to keep an old horse / which needs no longer take the long road." The propositional force comes out most strongly in the expression pu pi "need not." The moon and the clouds, the sky and the night belong to nature, but negation and necessity belong to logic. When a sentence uses pu pi, it no longer describes but asserts; it no longer calls for visualization, which is the proper response to imagery, but for assent or dissent, which is the proper response to assertion. Adapting a theory developed by Ernst Cassirer in his Lan- guage and Myth, we will propose a distinction of language into two poles, the imagistic pole and the propositional pole. In our present example, lines 1-4 belong to the first pole and lines 7-8 belong to the second. The two distinctions, imagistic/propositional and continuous/dis- continuous, are based upon two different criteria. The first answers the question, what kind of "meaning" does a verbal expression refer to and how is that meaning apprehended? That is, whether the "cmeaning" is primarily perceptual or conceptual. The second an- swers the question, what kind of rhythm does the syntax of that verbal expression create? In practice, however, these two distinctions are frequently related. If a line has minimal syntax, then its rhythm is</page><page sequence="11">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 59 likely to be discontinuous and its imagistic function correspondingly enhanced. If a proposition is to indicate the relations among its com- ponent parts, it has to have a more complicated syntactic apparatus, which at once weakens the image-making power of the individual words and gives the sentence a fullness that allows it to sustain a more continuous rhythm. There are two other axes of progressions in the poem. The first four lines are exclusively concerned with spatial relations. Time makes its first and disguised appearance in line 4. "eNight" refers to time, but "eternal night" masks the temporal in the eternal. The next couplet is unmistakably temporal in emphasis. 9 A i n . ?i / 5RA iA Y "eSetting sun" and "autumn wind" suggest time running out. Yu Cestill" and yiu "will" are adverbs which accent the hopes and fears of the future, the implication being that my heart is still hale but may not be for long, and that I am not well now and will soon be. (Recall the use of the temporal adverb "again" in a previous example, in 1.2.) The last couplet conveys a sense of time mainly by its continuous rhythm; but also, by stating "Since antiquity . . ." it extends time backwards beyond the immediate present and future. Secondly, the first couplet is strictly in the objective, impersonal mode. The second couplet wavers between the subjective and ob- jective modes; two readings "the eternal night shares (its) loneliness with the moon" and "in the eternal night, I and the moon are together alone" coexist in the ambiguity of line 4; line 3 is similarly ambiguous. The third couplet clearly has a subjective tone; "eheart" and eesick- ness" point explicitly to the poet; and yii, like "will" in English, expresses both volition and futurity. In the last couplet the subjective voice of the poet is heard as it comes out to express a judgment, emphasized by "eneed not." Thus the poem progresses along four related axes: imagistic discontinuous spatial objective propositional continuous temporal subjective While all four lines of progress impart a sense of direction-and hence unity-to the poem, the unifying function of the proposition at the end of the poem deserves special attention. Up to line 6, the impres-</page><page sequence="12">60 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN sion conveyed is highly discrete for several reasons. The three coup- lets, each in parallel construction, are self-enclosed units cut off from each other. Lines 1 and 2 consist of four noun phrases, with no linkage of any kind from one to the next. The "eeternal night" of line 4 is immediately followed by the "esetting sun" of line 5, which rules out any principle of continuity along naturalistic lines. Thus what we get from the first three couplets is a set of fragmented images, vivid in its individual components, but deficient in overall integration. But it is a paramount principle that a successful poem must be an organic whole, and in this poem the wholeness is achieved through the propositional function of its last two lines, which read: Since antiquity, keep old horse / no need to take the long road. "eSince antiquity" takes up the temporal note introduced in lines 4-6; !eold horse" is a deprecating reference to the poet himself, who earlier appears as homesick and book-worn, ill in health but hale in heart; eelong road" echoes the spatial separation suggested by lines 1-3; eeold horse no need to take the long road" expresses both the hopes and fears earlier indicated in lines 5-6. Thus as the proposition sweeps up its component parts in a continuous rhythm, it also inte- grates the separate images and themes reflected in these parts-in other words, imparts a wholeness to the entire poem. When we talk about the relations within a work of art, we are more often than not talking about them in two senses. ee. . . there are relatively large-scale relations among the main parts and relatively small-scale relations among the subordinate parts-or, in other words, there are relations among large, and perhaps distant, regions, and there are relations among neighboring regions, of the [aesthetic] ob- ject. Hence we shall distinguish two species of aesthetic form: struc- ture and texture."4 In Recent Style poetry, the units of structure are the couplet and the line within a couplet. The following statements, with due qualification, are samples of structural generalizations about Recent Style poetry. The middle couplets of Regulated Verse are imagistic in language and discontinuous in rhythm; the final couplet is propositional in language and continuous in rhythm. The final line or couplet in Recent Style poetry often departs from the simple 4 Monroe C. Beardsley, Aesthetics (New York, 1958), pp. 168-169.</page><page sequence="13">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 61 declarative mood; in which case its mood may be interrogative, hypo- thetical, exclamatory, or imperative; and its function in such moods is to speak the voice of the poet and to project the poem beyond its physical confines of four or eight lines. Time and place are usually indicated in the beginning of a poem, and as the poem progresses, the subjective mode generally supersedes the objective. In poetry, texture is the local interaction of words-once the emi- nent domain of Empsonian criticism. In the above poem, for example, the relation between "one" of line 2 and "alone" of line 4 is textural, and so is the relation between "distant" of line 3 and "eternal" of line 4. Texture may generate structure. For example, in the lines already cited: The moon sets, a raven cries, frost fills the sky River maples, fishermen's lanterns,-facing sadness I lie the individual lexical items generate relations which in turn organize them locally. "The moon sets," "a raven cries," ".frost fills the sky," by being predawn events and by being isolated intransitive (or pseudo- transitive sentences), define that species of temporariness which in turn locates them. "River maples" and "fishermen's lanterns," by being river objects and by being nouns in juxtaposition, span the virtual space which in turn connects them. When we talk about the relation between line 1 and line 2-namely, one is temporal and the other is spatial-we are talking in structural terms. When we de- scribe how the spatial and temporal relations are generated, we are talking in textural terms. In addition to the above kinds of textural relation, which one may find in any poetry, Recent Style poetry of the T'ang dynasty is distinguished by the fact that its lexicon is organized into semantic categories-categories which stipulate what may or may not occur in corresponding positions in the two lines of an antithetical couplet. Thus we have celestial and terrestrial objects, flora and fauna, human relations and artifacts, colors and numbers, etc. As a result of this categorization, individual words not only interact with other words in a particular poem, but also represent the categories to which they belong. The archetypal flavor of Recent Style poetry is mainly due to this fact; thus "withered pedant" and "homesick stranger" are Man;</page><page sequence="14">62 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN "moon, ccloud ," esky, " sun" are Heaven; "enight," eday," teau- tumn" are Time; "eYangtze" and "eHan," Earth, etc. Semantic cate- gorization is a curious kind of texture, namely, the relation of indi- vidual words outside of any particular poem. But insofar as it bears upon the interaction of words within a couplet, we shall consider it texture nevertheless. Structure and texture will not be the main concern of the present study, but a subsequent one. Here we shall concentrate on the units no larger than a couplet and frequently much smaller than a line. These are the material, the minimal components of a poem, whereas structure and texture are forms which organize them into an organic whole. In what follows, the order of presentation will repeat the sequence in this miniature study. We will begin with the simplest linguistic unit capable of assuming a poetic function in itself, namely, nouns or noun phrases. Next come the attributive sentence (noun followed by stative verb), the intransitive sentence, the transitive sentence, etc. As we proceed from the simple to the complex, we shall in fact be pro- ceeding along the four axes previously outlined, and the number of factors that need to be taken into consideration will increase ac- cordingly. It is perhaps appropriate to say a few words about the relation be- tween our previous work and the present endeavor. In "eAmbiguity in Grammar and in Poetry" (in Chinese, CYi Y, 1969) we attempted to apply Empsonian analysis to Chinese poetry, as well as Chomsky's generative grammar to explain how certain sentences in Chinese poetry were derived. Since then our view has changed rather dras- tically. First, if the aim of criticism is to enhance our appreciation of poetry, then it is far more important to understand what poetic func- tion various types of sentences perform than how such sentences are derived. Secondly, Donald Davie's book called our attention to the intimate relation between syntax and image making-an awareness absent in "eAmbiguity." Thirdly, grammatical ambiguity (in the sense that a sentence has more than one deep structure) turns out to be the normal state in Chinese poetry, though "eAmbiguity" gave the im- pression that it is deviant and noteworthy. For these reasons, we decided to examine the syntax of Recent Style poetry anew, and the present study is the result. Several parts of "eAmbiguity," however,</page><page sequence="15">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 63 are absorbed into this paper, especially the second division "eDy- namic Image." In "Tu Fu's 'Autumn Meditations"' (HJAS, 1968) we shifted from literary theory to practical criticism and attempted to discern all the relevant linguistic features in that cycle of poems and indicate the poetic function they perform. A study of that type, however, is not without its intrinsic limitations. No phenomenon can be explained in the absence of theory. But in a study such as "Autumn Meditations," whose central aim is to explicate the text, it seemed inappropriate to digress into long and involved theoretical discussions. For this reason, while the task then at hand required us to take positions on various theoretical issues, we were unable to spell out the underlying reasons. The explication of a single text-in this case, a cycle of eight poems- is further subject to a related limitation. As Northrop Frye pointed out recently, "It [explicatory criticism] simply explicates one work after another, paying little attention to any larger structural principles connecting the different works explicated."5 While what Frye means by "larger structural principles" is not entirely clear, we can extract from his statement a useful observation: the poetry of a given period, genre, or style is characterized by recurrent features, both in the composition of individual lines and in the overall organization of indi- vidual poems. It is these features which connect the different instances of a common species. In the present study, we shall try to indicate, at the level of words and sentences, the features common to Recent Style poetry, and outline a theory of their poetic functions. 2. NOUN AND THE SIMPLE IMAGE 2.1 Varieties of Isolating Syntax The central question in this section is: under what syntactic condi- tions does a noun or noun phrase achieve isolation and thus become the vehicle of a simple image? But first, let us take note of two nonsyntactic conditions which also favor isolation. One, except for the final couplet, each line in a Recent Style poem constitutes an independent unit. When two lines form a couplet, there is even more autonomy; the couplet form always stops the forward drive and induces an attraction between corresponding 5 Northrop Frye, "The Critical Path," Daedalus (Spring, 1970), p. 272.</page><page sequence="16">64 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN words in the two lines. Two, the major pause in a seven-syllable line occurs after the fourth syllable, and the minor pause, after the second syllable; the major pause in a five-syllable line occurs after the second syllable. Therefore a disyllabic noun, occurring at the beginning of a five-syllable or seven-syllable line, has already achieved a degree of isolation just by virtue of these prosodic features. All the binoms in the beginning of the first six lines, for example, illustrate this phenom- enon. Wts%? / -"g{ t8 t / 7g n g. H 'LA'J1? / agR Syntactic conditions for isolation may be classified under three headings. When one noun or noun phrase immediately follows an- other, the condition is discontinuity. When two or more grammatical constructions coexist in a line, the condition is ambiguity. Disconti- nuity is having too little grammar, ambiguity is having too much; both work against the forward movement of the poem. A third condition is dislocation-when the normal word order of a line is disturbed, or when a phrase intrudes into the middle of a line which otherwise has a natural flow. As we will see, these conditions, in various combina- tions, may coexist in a line, and it is not always clear where one condition begins and the other ends. The simplest case of discontinuity is when a line contains nothing except nouns, for example, the first couplet of "Yangtze and Han." There is a natural temptation to read line 1 either as "By Yangtze and Han, a homesick stranger," in which case "Yangtze and Han" be- comes the place-condition; or as "A homesick stranger (who is) by Yangtze and Han," in which case "Yangtze and Han" becomes, in Chinese, the premodifier of "a homesick stranger." Though both readings are clearly implied, we should resist the temptation. The most effective way of reading this line is to take it as it is, as two nouns in juxtaposition, in which case we get two simple images and the sharpest contrast between the vastness of the two rivers and the smallness of the human figure. In HIAt'11? / Vt W!ITf (459), the meaning is that the two bodies of waters are like flanking bright mirrors, and the twin bridges are like a falling multicolored rainbow. But that is a metaphoric rela-</page><page sequence="17">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 65 tion obtained through texture. On the imagistic level of analysis, what we have are just four images. The general point to be made is this. Syntactic discontinuity favors the making of simple images. When two visually strong images are placed in juxtaposition, they frequently enter into further relations, chief among which are those of similarity and contrast. When we add grammatical particles (e.g., eeby"l) to make the syntax more continuous, as we are often forced to do in English translation, we at once reduce the imagistic impact of the individual nouns and narrow down the range of relations between the two nouns. Other examples of lines made of nouns exclusively are: RAt )N / J&lt;Sl?;1K; e"Cockcrow, straw inn, moon / human footprint, plank bridge, frost" (CTS, 6741); "Soft mulberries, drooping willows, ten- odd houses" (618); "willow lake, pine island, lotus flower temple" (613); -NA;X 4)lJW. Sometimes a noun with its modifiers constitutes a line all by itself: *SM19 "Desolate an- cient (emperor's) traveling lodge" (779); U4CVMAIU / JI*'1k1 ; #$i+%JHUMV / -VPAHSA (778). When lines of this type occur, the fact that they are both noun-phrases and self-contained lines gives them double isolation. They are, in a sense, the true forerunners of "The apparitions of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough." The above illustrates deviant syntax-what we do not normally find in prose. But when the syntax is perfectly regular, it is still possible to achieve a degree of isolation. 9 n 4JCbN / fATA R.. The first line implies both similarity and contrast: "Though my heart is like the setting sun (in the state of decline), it is still hale," and "My heart, unlike the setting sun, is still hale." The same applies to the second line: "Though my sickness is like the autumn wind (as the harbinger of death), it will soon be cured," and "My sickness, unlike the autumn wind, will soon be cured." Once again, the syntax is that of one noun following another ("setting sun, heart. . ." and "autumn wind, sickness ... ," which we earlier defined as discontinuous), and "setting sun" and "autumn wind" are independent images. Both factors are essential for double comparison. "Setting sun" and "autumn wind" are, grammatically, instances of</page><page sequence="18">66 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN time-condition. In T'ang poetry, expressions of time and place are sometimes clearly marked as such. f1tE TIEt&amp;1 "I (your humble maid) live at Horizontal Pond" (758); here place expression is marked by the fact that it occurs after a verb. "*gJl "During night, the sound of wind and rain" (758); f#kA Ilb AII "During autumn, moun- tain rain is frequent" (757); here time expressions are marked by the following lai. In other instances, however, the expression for time- or place-condition occurs at the beginning of a sentence, and like the example of the last paragraph, it is isolated to a certain degree. tSM114 A. QJ / "T-+ "Fine drizzle, the fish come out / Light wind, swallows tilt" (CTS, 2455); :7Aiff1 / JAMiYA El e "Great desert, solitary smoke (stands) straight / Long river, setting sun (is )round" (435). Because this type of construction occurs with great frequency, it constitutes a rich source for simple images. Ambiguity joins discontinuity when a noun phrase represents both the place-condition and the subject of a sentence. In b i RI M 4WTHM (8io) it is not clear whether the white cloud and the bright moon are mourning Lady Hsiang-o, or someone is mourning her under the white cloud and the bright moon. Partly because of this ambiguity, e"white cloud" and "bright moon" are detached from the rest of the sentence. In lines 3 and 4 of "Yangtze and Han," the three conditions -discontinuity, ambiguity, and dislocation-appear all at once. M A it / *17 Xi - Since these three conditions are just different names for what we have discussed before, our comments will be brief. Here the normal word order is dislocated by the reversal between the coverbs (kung and t'ung) and their objects (t'ien and yiieh). In addition to slowing down the flow, this dislocation has the further consequence of throwing the antonyms t'ung "together" and ku "alone" right against each other. With this, the sentence disintegrates into two contrasting pairs, e"eternal night/moon" and "together/alone." "Together/alone" gives voice to the poignant fact that the only companion the poet has in the vast world is the moon. And here we should remind ourselves that it is precisely because "eternal night" and "moon" are simple images-that is, they are nouns that have achieved isolation via their imagistic power-that the other pair could achieve the extreme degree of independence which it has.</page><page sequence="19">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 67 Other varieties of dislocation are not quite as dramatic, but they are no less important. Inversion is one. In 00 WBlP / UUE Y "Willow color, spring mountain reflects / pear blossom, evening birds conceal" (CTS, 1278), inversion moves the object of the sentence (eewillow color," e"pear blossom") and gives it greater independence. Inversion also plays a part in Vti fIi if since iiQ*A is ac- tually the object of K "drink" in the next line . Another variety of dislocation obtains when a noun or a phrase in- trudes into the middle of a line and cuts off the natural flow. In IX4 WA- F (792), "yellow sand pierces gold armor" would be a con- tinuous line, but now continuity is interrupted by "hundred battles." As a result, eeyellow sand" is isolated. (The meaning of this line is "The yellow sand in the time of a hundred battles pierces the gold armor.") In F!1 A iNMfD / 472ILLEWk (422), the interrupting agents are f.IGFn and E i, two place words. The next example occurs in a famous poem by Li Po, in which he describes his journey in the high mountains of Szechuan: WtJ'kANikiB / S -0gt "mountain from man's face rises / cloud by horse's head grows" (458). Here the coverbal phrase "from man's face" cuts off "mountain" from its verb predicate "rises." We are thus first confronted by the monosyllabic noun "mountain" standing by itself, and then, as we move on, we realize that the traveller is standing on ground so high that his face is level with the mountain. Other varieties of dislocation are more complex in that the inversion involves more than a single noun or noun phrase. ;A$PW / H eN f Fountain-sound gurgle precipitous rock / sun-color cold blue pine. (425) The first line may be read as "the fountain sound gurgles above pre- cipitous rocks." But the reading is not perfect since place-condition usually occurs at the beginning of a line and here it occurs at the end. It may also be read as a causative sentence, eeprecipitous rocks cause fountain sound to gurgle," but in this case, the word order in Chinese should be "precipitous rocks / gurgle / fountain sound." Actually there is no need to choose. What this line conveys at the moment of impact is three independent perceptions-the sound of a fountain, the</page><page sequence="20">68 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN sight of precipitous rocks, and the kinesthetic feel of gurgling-con- nected in some indefinite way. Similarly, the second line consists of sun rays, chilliness, and blue pines. As to the question whether sun rays chill blue pines, or sun rays are chilly amidst the blue pines, or blue pines chill sun rays-this question cannot and need not be answered as our attention is fully absorbed in the images. In another couplet with identical construction, 10114. / ATO-MA (CTS, 2403), the relation among the constituent items is also associative instead of causal or spatial; we have a general sense of lowering or descent of chaotic clouds and light dusk, and a vivid image of the dance of driving snowflakes. The most famous instance of syntactic ambiguity is perhaps in the two lines by Tu Fu: .emj / OMO IRJRk Fragrant-rice peck-left parrot grain Green wu (-t'ung tree) perch-age phoenix branch. (589) There are two views concerning the grammar of these lines. The first view holds that these lines are equative sentences, with the copula implied: "the fragrant rice is, or consists of, the grains pecked and left behind by the parrot / the green wu-t'ung tree is, or consists of, those branches perched upon and aged by the phoenix." Since the equation is between "rice" and "grains," and "wu-t'ung tree" and "branches," the modifiers in between are interrupting elements that create discontinuity. The second and more prevalent view holds that these lines are instances of inversion. The original would have been "the parrots pecked and dropped grains of fragrant rice" and "the phoenix perched upon and aged branches of the green wu-t'ung tree." The word order in the poem is obtained by an exchange be- tween "fragrant rice" and "parrot," and a similar exchange between "green wu-t'ung tree" and "phoenix." Whichever view we take, the fact remains that syntactic dislocation, whether caused by interrup- tion or inversion, has cut up each of these lines into four disjointed segments, 2:2:2:1. As a result, four nouns achieve isolation and be- come the vehicles of simple images: "fragrant rice" and "green wu- t'ung" explicitly indicate their sensory qualities by the adjectives "fragrant" and "green"; and "parrot" and "phoenix" evoke visions of many-colored splendor.</page><page sequence="21">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 69 The above is not meant to be an exhaustive catalogue of isolating conditions. But this general survey, we hope, is sufficient to establish the following two points. First, there are many syntactic conditions in Recent Style poetry which favor the isolation of nouns and noun phrases. Some of these conditions are peculiar to the language of Chinese poetry, for example, nouns in juxtaposition and multiple inversion. But other conditions utilize grammatical resources no dif- ferent from those in prose or ordinary speech. This fact can be stated more generally. The topic-topic-comment construction is common to colloquial Chinese and literary Chinese alike. When both topics are nouns, what we have is one variety of discontinuity, e.g., "eternal night, moon ... " "light wind, swallows... ." The topic-comment construction, even more common, is a very loose type of construction. And this looseness also favors the detachment of the topic. The second point follows directly from the first. When the syntactic conditions favor isolation and the isolated item is a noun or noun phrase with imagistic potentials, what we have is a simple image. In other words, Recent Style poetry of the T'ang dynasty is replete with noun-images, and they play a role far more important than their counterparts in English poetry. 2.2 Concreteness in Poetry So far we have restricted our attention to the external syntax of image-making nouns or noun phrases, that is, the formal aspect of the relation of such terms to the rest of the line. Let us now turn to the complementary question, what kind of images do nouns and noun phrases make? The word "'kind" is meant to point to the direction of philosophical or semantic grammar in general, and to two questions in particular. It seems natural, at least at first sight, to say that noun-based images are concrete and thing-centered-concrete because otherwise images would not be imaginable, and thing-centered because as we all learned from school grammar, a noun is the name of a person, place, or thing. Such, for example, is indeed the view of Hulme and others. Hulme said, "[Poetry3 is not a counter language, but a visually concrete one.... Images in verse are not merely decoration, but the very es- sence of an intuitive language." A similar statement was made by James Liu with respect to Chinese poetry: "Naturally, we find nu-</page><page sequence="22">70 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN merous simple images in Chinese poetry, as in any other poetry, for it is the nature of poetic language to be concrete rather than abstract."6 But what do we mean when we say that poetic language should be concrete and that it is images which endow poetry with this concrete- ness? In a certain sense, we all know what we mean. Percept is more concrete than concept, and species is more concrete than genus; thus eespade" is more concrete than both "truth" and "implement." But the question is not quite as simple at the next level of analysis. Con- sider "rusty old spade," "that spade" said with a wave of the hand, "the spade behind the door," "the spade with a notch on its handle." Which is more concrete and which is more abstract? In one sense, "erusty old spade" is more concrete in that we can imagine its general qualities, dark in color and rough in texture. In another sense, "that spade" and "the spade behind the door," both spoken with a pointing gesture, are more concrete in that they specify which spade it is; though before finding the spade, we have no idea what it is like. "The spade with a notch on its handle" both designates a particular spade and supplies a specific detail. But it provides no direction for finding the spade, nor does it describe the overall appearance. Our first task, then, is to clarify the respect or dimension in which a verbal expres- sion is said to be concrete rather than abstract. Hulme, in the passage quoted in 1. 1, also spoke of "concrete thing" and "physical thing." At one point he said, "[Poetry] always en- deavours to arrest you, and to make you continuously see a physical thing, to prevent you gliding through an abstract process." Fenollosa similarly expressed the view that the transitive sentence "brings lan- guage close to things." Now, in one sense, it makes no difference whether we think of the world as composed of things or qualities; a thing is the intersection of all its qualities, and a quality is what a certain class of objects have in common. But in another sense, it makes a world of difference. A painting, for example, is composed of people and objects, as well as colors and planes. For da Vinci and other Renaissance masters, the painting is clearly centered around persons or objects. Color and hue, planes and lines are all organized in terms of the principle of realistic representation. For Matisse and Cezanne, the painting immediately impresses us with the intensity of its colors 6 James J. Y. Liu, The Art of Chinese Poetry (Chicago, 1962), p. 104.</page><page sequence="23">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 71 and the geometry of its shapes. The painting still represents something which we recognize, but the relations among its component parts may not be what we find in the outside world. It is our view that the Recent Style poetry of the T'ang dynasty is like Matisse and Cezanne in that it gives greater emphasis to the intrinsic character of its artistic ma- terial than what the material is used to represent. In this particular case, the material includes both the simple noun-images and the qualities which such images evoke. And to explain what we mean, we need to distinguish between two kinds of orientation, toward things and toward qualities. This will be our second problem. These questions are intimately related. In a language such as that of English poetry-a language which has many syntactic resources for accumulating details upon an object, or for specifying the nat- uralistic relations among objects-what we get is one kind of con- creteness. It is a concreteness oriented toward things. As we absorb one detail after another, we get the illusion that the physical thing is within our reach or the entire scene is just before our eyes. But just as syntactic linkage binds words to each other, the pull exerted by ob- jects upon qualities likewise prevents the latter from achieving isola- tion of another kind-to become airborne like the planes and colors of Matisse and Cezanne. The situation in Recent Style poetry is quite different. As we have already seen, Recent Style poetry is replete with simple images. We shall eventually see that the vehicle for such images is predominantly in the form adjective-noun or noun-noun. Adjectives clearly stand for qualities. But the majority of nouns modifying another noun are also strongly oriented toward qualities, for example, "jade flute" is cold and smooth, eegold armor" is yellow and bright. Thus, just in terms of the internal constitution of simple images, there is an equilibrium between qualities and things. In addition, the language of T'ang poetry is characterized by an extreme looseness in syntax; grammati- cal devices for accumulating details or specifying relations are either not in the Chinese language in the first place, or were left behind in the process of transforming ordinary language into an instrument of poetry. When syntax is weak, texture becomes dominant. And among textural relations, those of similarity and contrast have a special im- portance for simple images. Add to these facts two further considera- tions: the couplet form is based upon similarity and contrast, and</page><page sequence="24">72 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN when we compare two things, we always compare them with respect to some property or quality. The conclusion, then, is that simple images in T'ang poetry have a strong orientation toward qualities, not things. What we have here is a very different kind of concreteness. Simple images are concrete in the sense that they evoke vivid qualities. They are abstract, however, in the sense that they are not rooted in things-in things whose parts or relations to other things are further specified. 2.3 Quality Orientation of Simple Images The above statements can be viewed in sharper focus through a specific example, again, lines 3 and 4 of "Yangtze and Han." n 9 3 / A7 IL MP The word t'ien "sky" is a simple image. As a monosyllabic noun de- void of any modification, it is clearly not an object with accumulated details. In A. C. Graham's translation, line 3 becomes "Under as far a sky as that streak of cloud." This is the kind of expression customary for English poetry, in which the spatial, and hence realistic, relation between the sky and the cloud is explicitly stated. In the Chinese original, however, the spatial relation remains implicit. "Sky," as an object, generally serves as the reservoir of a set of qualities-qualities usually associated with sky: empty, blue, vast, far away. In the present context, "sky" functions as the bearer of the quality of vastness. Why is this so? First of all, in the previous couplet, there is already a sharp contrast between the vastness of the universe and the insignificance of a homesick stranger. Secondly, t'ien has as its immediate context two nouns, p'ien yiin "a patch of cloud" which is small and yung yeh e"eternal night" which is vast. Each of these items consists of a noun, whose quality of being vast or small is explicitly brought out by the modifier, "patch" or "eternal"; the relevant semantic feature is cog- nate to the opposition between vast and small. Thus "sky" is oriented toward qualities for two reasons: negatively, because it is free from e"realistic" functions, either as a noun with a specific reference, or as the point of accumulation of further details; and positively, because it occurs in a field of qualities informed by the contrast between vastness and smallness.</page><page sequence="25">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 73 The following lines are from Li Po's "Merrymaking in the Palace" (tR+fWn=-WJ), the second in a set of eight: op 2 ili! / AVb8M T-414 / / T. Willow-color yellow-gold tender / Pear-blossom white-snow fragrant Jade-tower nest kingfisher / gold-hall lock (in) mandarin duck. (455) The next four lines go on to relate the calling of singers and dancers out of their chambers to accompany the Emperor's carriage, and end with a couplet in the question-and-answer form (in our terms, propo- sitional language), "Who is number one in the palace? / Lady Flying Swallow at the Chao Yang Hall." What interest us are the simple images in the first four lines. Lines 1 and 2 say that willow is golden yellow and tender, and that pear blossoms are snow-white and fragrant. But syntactic discontinuity enables "yellow gold" and "white snow" to achieve isolation; they are therefore simple images. Now, "yellow gold" and "white snow" belong to a large class of adjective-noun compounds which also in- cludes IJNI "bright moon," b1 X "white dew," J ii4J "long river," *&amp;4 "green water," " "curved bow." The function of the adjec- tive in these compounds is not to restrict but to emphasize; the addi- tion of "yellow" to "gold" does not restrict the range of objects referred to by "gold"; but "yellow" emphasizes the quality-in this case, the color-habitually associated with "gold." Expressions such as "yellow gold" or "bright moon" have some- times been called hackneyed images or cliches. This view, however true it may be, requires amplification. T'ang lyrical poetry moves in a field of qualities, and insofar as such expressions accent qualities, they serve an essential function in sustaining the field. When the poetic lexicon contains a large set of expressions, tried and tested, it is then possible to make new patterns and textures out of these expres- sions. As we shall soon see, this is indeed the case in Li Po's poem. In lines 3 and 4, antithesis highlights the colorfulness of two birds, g "kingfisher" and RMW "mandarin duck." These are disyllabic nouns which belong to the same class as Kk. "phoenix," 4%X40 "par- rot," #I "grape," X4WM "hibiscus." Even without modifying ad- jectives these nouns are oriented towards visual qualities; they are all</page><page sequence="26">74 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN names of colorful objects. In addition, R and Uft are alliterative or rhyming syllables, and hence auditorily effective. Antithesis also brings out the visual qualities of "jade tower" and "gold hall" of the same lines; one is white and the other is yellow. Color plays an important role in organizing the first four lines of Li Po's poem. There is, in the first place, the simple fact that every single line is permeated by color. Moreover, there is an intricate permutation of the colors, which may be schematized as follows. (green) yellow / (white) white white green / yellow multicolor The systematic study of organization by texture (in which qualities play an indispensable role) will be the subject of another study. Here we are preparing the ground by emphasizing the quality orientation of simple images. "Jade tower" and "gold hall" are noun-noun compounds, in which the first noun modifies the second noun, and at the same time serves as an indicator of quality, in this case, white or yellow. The same analysis applies to a large class of noun-noun compounds: 8P "snow peak," fta. "silver pot," ULt "brocade sail," 3i"f "jade mast," 11*j "pearl curtain." The dominant quality indicated in these examples is visual. But in the following lines by Tu Fu, the qualities evoked are both visual and tactile. *XWSV# / W3E-W (469) In these lines, Tu Fu imagines his wife as she thinks of him in the moonlight: "In the fragrant mist, cloud hair-bun is wet. Under the clear (moon) ray, jade arm is cold." "Cloud" describes the hair-bun; "jade" characterizes the whiteness of her arm; their effect is visual. But the cloud is wet like the mist, and the jade is cold like the moon. In linking "mist" to "wet," and "clear (moon) ray" to "cold," "cloud" and "jade" also evoke tactile qualities-that is, wetness and coldness-and thus organize these lines by texture. Auditory qualities are usually represented by the instrument or agent that makes them. X- "guitar," an alliterative binom, is to sound as RZ "mandarin duck" is to sight. Other names of musical instruments often appear together with adjectives that add local color</page><page sequence="27">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 75 or other types of interest: MMJi "Tartar reed," *- "frontier flute," -i tpainted horn," *M "metal drum"; but the name of the instru- ment may also occur without a modifier. Under the category of agent, we find expressions such as A T"bird's cry," Nw eehorse's neigh," A' Thuman voice." When a modifier modifies a noun, that modifier not only empha- sizes a quality but often also indicates the physical sense to which that quality appeals. )A "wind" is somewhat abstract in itself. 49JR, in which shuo means either "ewinter" or Tnorth," is dry and severe; AAJ "elake wind" on the other hand is humid and mild; both appeal to the tactile sense. WAJR "sleeve wind," *JAk "curtain wind," WA "hair pin wind" make the wind visible. 'M "flute wind," as in Tu Mu's famous line 'F Fi 44-^gJR, calls the auditory sense into play. There are in addition a few nouns whose primary function is to indicate whether an object is oriented to the auditory sense or to the visual sense. ( se in some situations means "color," but a better equivalent is probably "sight" or "look," that is,the visual aspect of an object. Se can be preceded by almost any noun: lB 1, $ , i@ , J 1) 1 , M j. The auditory counterpart to E is E sheng "sound," which also forms a vast number of compounds with a preceding noun: * I, iIJ , a I, Sit 1c, i 1, A 1, 4 1. These two nouns are almost in- variably matched in antithetical couplets: A / H E (425), A / 111 (498) ,?/NJ(51), lb 1;/7d*r (617). Allied to these two nouns but occurring with much lower frequency are $ "shadow, shape," e "sound," " "sound," which appear in compounds such as At5 "moon shadow," iiAi "washing-block sound," raji "reed sound." Sheng, se etc. are noteworthy in several respects. While they are abstract in themselves, they make the preceding noun more con- crete since they indicate the physical sense appealed to, that is, audi- tory or visual. But for nouns like chung "bell" which are predomi- nantly auditory, the addition of sheng "sound" (to form the com- pound chung sheng "bell sound") merely serves to emphasize the auditory, just as "yellow" in "yellow gold" emphasizes the visual. Let us note also that in our previous examples, the quality indicator, whether a noun or an adjective, precedes the noun-object ("green water," "jade tower"). But in the present case, the quality orientation is indicated by the posterior noun ("water sound"). Thus from a grammatical viewpoint, "water" modifies "sound," but from the per-</page><page sequence="28">76 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN spective of image making, it is "sound" which brings out the auditory quality of water. When two coordinate nouns form a compound, what we get is the concrete universal, in the sense that the universal, and sometimes also the universe, is embodied in its concrete manifestations. The opening couplet of "Yangtze and Han," which conveys a cosmic grandeur by the matched pair ?IE and M-it, is a case in point. Tu Fu is particu- larly fond of noun-noun in coordination. In I1iAi-X iilJ / i* *- g (470), the compound shan-ho "mountain-river" represents all features of geography, which remain immutable even as the nation (kuo), a human institution, is destroyed; ts'ao-mu ("grass-tree") stands for all living things, which, indifferent to wars and disturbances, be- come luxuriant as spring comes to the city. But Tu Fu is not the only one to make effective use of such compounds. In Wang Wei's couplet HUiE'?JAJ1 / M*iJ&amp;tL?if "Sun sets, river-lake (becomes) white / Tide comes, heaven-earth (becomes) blue" (430), river and lake, heaven and earth together constitute a common topic, the universe, in which the blue and the white merge into one another. Compounds similar to these are sublime, since they present nature in its full power and magnitude: H 1-1 "sun-moon," J -2 "wind-cloud," Nth "pass-mountain," ti "past-present." Others, which present medi- um-sized objects, are beautiful: .,f "fish-bird," ?AV "swallow- sparrow," M#P "rush-willow," fWi "rice-millet." In Tu Fu's * El UAA / *I3S I (CTS, 2558), the unceasing production and reproduction of nature is represented by the fish and the bird which multiply in the spring day, and the lotus and the water chestnut which abound in the river under the sky. 2.4 Poetic use of qualities The extent to which visual qualities are consciously exploited in Recent Style poetry may be gathered from the following examples. Earlier we spoke of nonrestrictive adjectives, "white cloud," ..clear wind," and so on. Restrictive adjectives are those thlat narrow down the range of objects referred to by the noun: X-' "yellow cloud," gk affi "hot wind," 1 "fragrant rice." Let us note that a great many restrictive adjectives, such as the ones cited, are also oriented toward qualities; nouns preceded by restrictive adjectives differ from those preceded by nonrestrictive adjectives only in the degree of generality.</page><page sequence="29">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 77 Degree turns into kind when we reach the proper name, whose ref- erence is unique. Proper names such as "John" and "Peter" refer but do not describe; their image-making potential seems to be nil. But geographic names in T'ang poetry often include colors or other vis- ually oriented words: ANIHA "Green-Maple River," OV#A "White- Emperor City," ** "Blue Sea (Kokonor) ", iP'3 "Jade-Gate Pass," V e "Brocade City," -uii "Brocade River," 3i_ "Jade Rampart," Ci II "Blue Field," Ai7J "Yellow River," , "Purple Pavilion." Had the T'ang poets been writing in English, "White House" and "Red Square" would have quickly entered the lexicon. Youth and old age are two abstract concepts. But in Li Po's couplet ;-:E AR A / VA 1-F "Red cheeks discard carriage and cap (of high office) / White head reclines (amidst) pines and clouds" (456), these concepts are represented by images with vivid colors, as if youth turns out to be nothing but the quality red, to be contrasted with the whiteness of old age. In another couplet by Li Po, youth is twice represented by colors: Mii: fX I / *AtVAKJf+1l "Red cheeks return to the old country / green years (salad days) rests at grassy isle" (CTS, 1768). A similar technique is employed by Tu Fu; the "green spring" of youth is matched by "white day" (daytime) in b~ H 4IfR R*ili / 1 (569); in the very last couplet of the "Autumn Meditations," eewhite head" is matched by "many-colored brush" which symbolizes the creative magic of Tu Fu's youth: Ui t11t / b v' l_ (589) . The standard association between a noun-object and an adjective- quality is exploited in various ways. In Li I's poem written during his visit to the northwest frontier of China, we have A1"'kraI Hl J a / fPJT2 i A 'IbS32 "How many places blow the pipes in the bright- moon night? / Which person leans against the sword under the white-cloud sky?" (640). The pipe is typically an instrument of the western tribes. The hackneyed expressions "bright-moon" and eewhite-cloud" convey the sense that the sky and the night are what everyone shares everywhere. When "pipe" occurs together with "'bright moon" and "white cloud," they depict the sense of disorienta- tion resulting from seeing the familiar in a strange surrounding. In Tu Fu's couplet ig- ES7 H i / X ;:UAJIgg)P "Dew from this day will be white / The moon, it is my hometown that is the brightest" (477), the intensity of hope and homesickness is projected into the tauto-</page><page sequence="30">78 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN logical adjectives "bright" and "white." (Compare "my love is a red, red rose.") In the previous example, "white" and "bright" stand out because their connection with the subject ("'moon" and "dew") is interrupted by an intervening phrase. The same device is effective in Tu Fu's lines f t'iZ!ii / RAtEMRf "Cultivate bamboos crisscrossy em- erald / Plant peaches brilliant red" (CTS, 2486). Tu Fu also experi- mented with putting color words at the beginning of a line: 2AlJk ?14k / 4 MPX "Red enters peach blossoms young / Green re- turns to willow leaves new" (CTS, 2438); 0,JIUfj 14Mb / TLA*;** "(By) emerald (one) knows beyond-the-lake grass / (By) red (one) sees east-of-the-sea cloud" (CTS, 2527). Sometimes syntactic disloca- tion is also involved: M&amp;*AiJVir / " "Green suspends wind-broken bamboo shoots / Red bursts rain-fattened plums" (CTS, 2347); the underlying sentences are probably "Wind breaks green bamboo shoots, causing them to hang down, rain fattens red plums causing them to burst open." Tu Fu achieves the same effect without resorting to inversion in a poem in which he describes the spring rain coming to nourish and moisten plants and trees. The poem ends with this couplet *W?Il#t / It-U' "Morning observe the red, wet place: / flower laden Brocade-Official City" (480). Here "flower" is literally the modifier of the qualities "red" and "'wet" instead of the other way around. This technique is continued by Tu Mu fLiPf lfIkBI~i "For a thousand miles, orioles sing, green reflects red" (828). One may say that green and red are the qualities of grass and flower reified, but qua imagery they are simply colors. The general effect achieved in all these examples is akin to the painting of Matisse and Ch'i Pai-shih: we see the vivid colors first and then the vague outlines of the represented objects. In this section, we used visual qualities to illustrate the fact that T'ang poets consciously exploited qualities in image making. This consciousness manifests itself in several ways. There is, in the first place, the sheer number and variety of words with a clear orientation towards visual qualities. Secondly, these words occur as matching pairs in couplets. Thirdly, as we study the development of poetic craft during the T'ang dynasty, we can discern in Tu Fu and Tu Mu a tendency to give color words greater prominence and isolation. Thus when we say that Recent Style poetry shows a strong orientation</page><page sequence="31">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 79 toward qualities instead of things, we are not imposing an artificial distinction upon it, but only describing one of its intrinsic charac- teristics. 2.5 Concreteness Revisited In an essay entitled "The Substantive Level," W. K. Wimsatt dis- tinguishes three main styles :' 1. The abstract or less than specific-substantive style: e.g., imple- ment 2. The minimum concrete or specific-substantive style: e.g., spade 3. The extra-concrete, the detailed, or more than specific style: e.g., rusty garden spade Earlier he spoke of the distinction between man and white man (which, we suppose, are respectively equivalent to spade and rusty spade) and defined the "substantive level" as follows: ". . . man and god are at a level of classification where specific and concrete are mutually implicated. We may describe this as a kind of critical or vaporizing line in the scale of generality. Above this level, what is abstract in a relative sense (not very specific) accommodates itself so readily to what is abstract in the absolute sense (not concrete) that it tends to leave concreteness behind. Solidity of substance abstracts into mere quality. Below this level, on the contrary, there is excrescence of detail" (p. 136). Later Wimsatt adds, "Both the more than substan- tive style and the less than substantive are pre-eminently internal and reflexive modes of description-expressing on the one hand the in- tricately sensitive, Proustean awareness of experience in detail, and on the other the dreamy abstractness, the suffused vagueness of poetry" (p. 144). We are citing Wimsatt both to agree and to disagree with him. "eSolidity of substance abstracts into mere quality" seems to be an apt characterization of simple images in Recent Style poetry. "The dreamy abstractness, the suffused vagueness" with which Wimsatt describes the effect of the less than substantive style, may also be applied to Recent Style poetry as a whole. Yet Recent Style poetry seldom deviates very far from the minimum concrete style; "sky" and eeyellow gold" are its typical noun-images. The question naturally arises as to why Recent Style poetry is less substantive than what 7 W. K. Wimsatt, The Verbal Icon (Lexington, Kentucky, 1954), p. 138.</page><page sequence="32">80 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN Wimsatt's theory predicts it to be. The reason, we believe, lies in the fact that Wimsatt pays attention to semantics but fails to give due weight to syntax. Specifically, we propose to modify Wimsatt's theory by a three- stage argument. 2.1 takes the perspective of external syntax, and argues that discontinuity, dislocation, and ambiguity-so prevalent in Recent Style poetry-enable nouns to achieve isolation. 2.3 and 2.4 examine the internal constitution of nouns-that is, adjective-noun and noun-noun compounds-and find that a majority have an in- trinsic orientation towards qualities. Substance is another name for thing; and insofar as simple images are quality oriented, Recent Style poetry gives the impression of being in the less than substantive style. In! 2.6, we shall argue that the English language has many syntactic devices for accumulating detail upon a noun-object, chief among which are relative pronouns, demonstratives, pronouns, and the defi- nite article. As a result, noun-images in English poetry are thing- oriented. Because of this basic difference between Chinese syntax and English syntax, English poetry usually ranks higher in terms of the substantive level. On the other hand, Wimsatt's classificatory scheme, after minor modifications, also allows us to restate what has already been said in a more systematic fashion. Let us now take up that task. Wimsatt used a mixed mode of analysis. From "implement" to eespade," the progression is from genus to species. From "spade" to e"rusty garden spade" the progression is from a simple noun to a noun modified by an adjective and another noun. In terms of the pure genus-species analysis, we may wish to extend the Tree of Porphyry further down, where at the bottom we reach the individual, whose linguistic counterpart is the proper name, the pronoun, or the de- monstrative. In general, all three are inimical to image making. In Recent Style poetry, proper names occur in two circumstances: as names of persons in allusions and as place names. Earlier we saw that place names are not devoid of image-making potentials, e.g., "Jade Pass," "Blue Field." Analogously, when a historical person is al- luded to, the purpose is not to reach back to that unique individual, but to recall an event associated with him-an event the general out- line of which is repeated under the present circumstance. As is well known, Recent Style poetry seldom employs personal pronouns; even</page><page sequence="33">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 81 the subject is often omitted. The demonstrative ("this," ".this day") occurs not in the imagistic part of the poem, but in the propositional part (that is, the ultimate or penultimate line), where its function is to bring out a contrast between two kinds of space-time, relative and absolute (see 4.3). These general observations raise an important question. For all practical purposes, the imagistic part has neither individuals nor singular references. How then does it achieve its here-and-nowness? This question will be answered when we discuss verbal predicates in Section 3, "Dynamic Image." Higher up the Tree of Porphyry are the various genera, subgenera, and species. Thus in the lexicon of Chinese poetry, "Man" compre- hends "king, minister, friend, relative"; "Bird" comprehends "parrot, swallow, sparrow, phoenix"; "Flower" comprehends "laurel, chry- santhemum, pear, peach." Coordinate noun construction ("heaven- earth," "river-lake"), as we saw earlier, is one way to reach up to a higher level of generality. Another way to reach the same level of generality is to use the archetypal or primitive terms that stand at the head of each genus, e.g., "Man," "Bird," "Flower." In the early years of the T'ang dynasty, there flourished a style of poetry which made effective use of archetypal terms. Wang Wei's "Bird-singing Valley" may be taken as an example. AUniJ t / H@EIP X W.W / 4 * Man at leisure, laurel flower fall. Night silent, spring mountain empty. Moon rise, startle mountain bird, Time to time sing amidst spring brook. (753) Three nouns appear with no modifiers at all: "man," "night," "moon." Two other nouns, "mountain" and "bird," are modified, but their modifiers do more to indicate time and place than to restrict reference. The subject matter of the poem is therefore the World, constituted by Man, Bird, Flower, Mountain, etc. The characteristic style of Wang Wei, often described as natural and simple, is in no small measure due to his use of unadorned archetypal nouns. This poem has been translated in Robert Payne, The White Pony (Mentor: New York, 1960 ), p. 154, as follows:</page><page sequence="34">82 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN Walking at leisure we watch laurel flowers falling. In the silence of this night the spring mountain is empty. The moon rises, the birds are startled As they sing occasionally near the spring fountain (valley). It is immediately apparent that all sense of the archetypal is lost. "Man" in the original poem is part of the World; "we" in this transla- tion constitutes the audience that watches a spring scene. " This night" refers to a specific night. The plural -s converts Bird as an archetype into several instances of the same. It has often been remarked that Chinese poetry has no tense, number, and pronoun, but the fact that their absence makes the archetypal poem possible has not been suffi- ciently noted. Let us now return to Wimsatt's mixed mode of analysis and con- struct a classification modeled after him, using the English equivalent for Chinese wherever possible. 1. Nouns unmodified: A. coordinate: heaven-earth, river-lake, Yangtze-Han B. abstract: sound, color [ c. plain: sky, moon, cloud, mountain D. disyllabic: RtbMy parrot, Ril phoenix, IM hibiscus, iWi grape 2. Nouns modified: A. by nonrestrictive adjective: bright moon, yellow gold, white cloud B. by restrictive adjective: hot wind, yellow cloud, fragrant rice c. by noun: gold hall, jade arm, cloud hair-bun, jade tower D. into proper names: Blue Field, Yellow River, Jade Pass, Blue Sea. The above represent all the major types of nouns relevant to image making. It will be observed that except for proper names, all these nouns are general terms, though their degree of generality may differ. In saying this, we are merely restating a truism already so well formu- lated by Wimsatt, "Every description in words, so far as it is a direct description (The barn is red and square) is a generalization. This is the nature of words. There are no individuals conveyed in words but only more or less specific generalizations . . ." (Wimsatt, p. 75).</page><page sequence="35">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 83 But why is this truism worth stating? It is worth stating because it helps to clarify the kind of concreteness said to be essential for image making, and also to formulate a preliminary characterization of Recent Style poetry. One kind of concreteness is exhibited in these speci- mens of imagism, in which there is an excrescence of detail: "Rose, harsh rose, marred and with stint of petals," "purple grackles- shining and bulging under leaves" (Wimsatt, p. 139). Here the ac- cumulation of one detail after another upon the noun-object ("rose," "egrackles") gives the impression of a zooming lense which focuses upon an individual; decreasing degree of generality converts into a vector that points. There is another kind of concreteness, the con- creteness of qualitative impression, which, as we have repeatedly emphasized, distinguishes the noun-images in Recent Style poetry. Such images usually have as their vehicle nouns and compounds with no further modifiers; that is, they are terms like 1.A-D and 2.A-C above. Even when a line consists of a single noun phrase, the fact that the line has only five or seven syllables seriously limits the number of modifiers that can precede the nuclear noun. In terms of our analysis of noun-images, then, Recent Style poetry tends to express the universal for two reasons. There is one style of poetry, represented by Wang Wei's "Bird-singing Valley," the uni- versality of which is due to the use of archetypal terms. But since the vast majority of noun-images has a strong quality orientation, and qualities are universals, Recent Style poetry as a whole is pervaded by the dreamy abstractness, the suffused vagueness which Wimsatt spoke of. 2.6 Accumulation of Detail by Syntax in English Poetry Syntax functions not only to isolate nouns, but also serves to ac- cumulate modifiers and qualifying clauses onto nouns. The second function, though almost entirely absent in Recent Style poetry, has a pervasive presence in English poetry. The main purpose of this sec- tion is to indicate what these accumulative operations are and how they function in English poetry. Daffodils I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills,</page><page sequence="36">84 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the Milky Way, They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay; Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. The waves beside them danced, but they Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: A poet could not but be gay In such a jocund company: I gazed-and gazed-but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought: For oft when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils. The focal image, the daffodils, is presented with a wealth of detail- where they are, how they line the shore, and how they dance; in this sense the poem is oriented toward an object, the daffodils. Individual details are attached to the object mainly by the pronouns; after the occurrence of "golden daffodils," it is successively referred to by "they," "them," "their," all italicized above for easy inspection. The definite article "the" serves the same function; "the daffodils" re- capitulates all that has been going on before. In addition, there are the relative pronouns ("that," "when," "which"), participial phrases ("fluttering and dancing"), prepositional phrases ("beside the lake, beneath the trees"), which function as the links between the noun- objects and their added detail. Wordsworth's daffodils are golden. A similar description occurs in Li Po's poem, where pear blossoms are said to be "snow-white fra- grant" 32itbW. But there are important differences. As noted earlier, the whiteness is accented because syntactic discontinuity</page><page sequence="37">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 85 enables "pear blossom" and "white snow" to achieve isolation, the entire four lines are permeated by a plentitude of colors, and "jade tower" resumes the motif of whiteness. In Wordsworth, the color of the daffodils is submerged in the wealth of other details. On the other hand, while we know a great many things about the daffodils, all we know about the pear blossoms is that they are snow-white and fra- grant. The above comparison is generally valid; when syntax induces linkages among words and semantics orients a poem toward objects, imagery will turn out to be constituted by realistic details and not hypostatized qualities. In Wordsworth's poem, the direction of accumulation of the pro- nouns and the definite articles is inward or centripetal; they relate words to other words. But in ordinary discourse, a pronoun can also be used to refer to a person or an object in the external world. In "I saw a man. I talked to him for quite a while," the direction of "him" is centripetal. If we are walking along the street and I exclaim, "Look at him," I want to draw your attention to another person; the direc- tion of "him" is outward or centrifugal. The same duality applies with equal force to demonstratives ("this," "that") and the definite article ("the"). It is often said that literature is not concerned with literal truths but with the imaginary, self-enclosed world created by the verbal re- lations among words themselves. MacLeish's dictum "A poem should not mean / but be" summarizes this point of view very well. Against this view, however, it should be pointed out that no work of literature can be entirely devoid of external reference, and one of the most frequently employed modes of mimesis is simply that of realistic representation. In this connection, it may be pertinent to observe that while the critical terms "realistic" or "naturalistic" are often applied to novels, they are not used in the discussion of poetry. What this means, we believe, is that before the rise of the kind of poetry asso- ciated with Imagism and Symbolism, all Western poetry was real- istic and naturalistic. Now, there are two ways to convey the real presence of an object in poetry. One is to describe an object in detail. While, as Wimsatt has pointed out, "there are no individuals con- veyed in words but only more or less specific generalizations," de- tailed description does create an illusion of individuality. The other way is to press into service the standard devices in ordinary discourse,</page><page sequence="38">86 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN namely, the deictic signs "this," "that," "the," etc. The following two poems will illustrate what we mean. Thomas Hood, "I Remember, I Remember" I remember, I remember The house where I was born, The little window where the sun Came peeping in at morn; I remember, I remember The roses, red and white, The violets, and the lily-cups, Those flowers made of light! The lilacs where the robin built, And where my brother set The laburnum on his birthday, The tree is living yet! Each use of "the" conveys a specific reference. "The house" refers to a particular house, "the little window" refers to a particular window in the house, and even "the sun" refers to the sun especially associated with the poet's childhood. The same is true of all the other occurrences of "the" in the poem. Henry Vaughan, "The Retreat" 0 how I long to travel back, And tread again that ancient track! That I might once more reach that plain Where first I left my glorious train; From whence th'enlightened spirit sees That shady City of Palm-trees. But ah! my soul with too much stay Is drunk, and staggers in the way! Some men a forward motion love, But I by backward steps would move; And when this dust falls to the urn, In that state I came, return. "That ancient track," "that plain," and "that shady city" all refer to something definite in the past. "That" in this poem and "the" in the</page><page sequence="39">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 87 previous one are favorite devices in poems of reminiscence. By using such words, the poet pretends that the reader is familiar with the things referred to, and thus gains his confidence. The accumulative devices exemplified in Wordsworth's poem clear- ly enjoyed wide currency in English poetry. The occurrence of the definite and indefinite articles is sometimes without special signifi- cance; in order to write a grammatically correct line, one has to use one or the other. In that sense, the poems by Thomas Hood and Henry Vaughan appear to be exceptional. But it should be pointed out that even when the effect is not as prominent, the use of "the" or "a" still makes a difference. In Wordsworth's poem, for example, the definite article in "beside the lake, beneath the trees," not only makes the lake and the trees specific, but also confers definiteness upon the daffodils by fixing their precise location. Change the lines to "A host of golden daffodils / beside a lake, beneath some trees," and our attention is no longer focused upon that particular field of daffodils, with its intimate significance for the poet. Often the definite article and the relative pronoun work hand in hand: "the lilacs where the robin built" and "the little window where the sun / came peeping in at morn." Here definite reference is defined by, and added to, de- scriptive details. Our general conclusion is that because of the general availability of forms for definite reference and accumulation of details, English poetry is realistic in tone. In particular, it shows a marked orientation toward objects, and its imagery is suffused with details. In contrast, Chinese has neither the definite article nor the indefi- nite article. Chinese also lacks most of the accumulative processes of English. Post modification is rare. In theory a noun can be preceded by any number of modifying phrases or adjectives, but in practice the number is serevely limited. Thus positively, syntactic discontinuity and dislocation, in various forms, enable nouns in Chinese to achieve iso- lation; and negatively, the absence of accumulative processes prevents details from accruing to noun-objects. Li-hua 1411M is literally "pear blossom," and nothing more. It is not "a pear blossom" nor "the pear blossom"; nor is it "pear blossoms" or "the pear blossoms"; and it does not occur with qualifying clauses trailing, e.g., "the pear blos- soms, beside the gold hall, beneath the jade tower, swaying and bending in the wind." Definite and indefinite reference, singular and plural in number, modification by relative clause-all these have to do</page><page sequence="40">88 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN with individuation and individuals. English poetry, more often than not, is concerned with individuals in real space-time. Li-hua is un- individuated, a collection of qualities not necessarily inhering in a substance. Because the imagistic part of a Recent Style poem largely consists of simple images such as "pear blossom" and "yellow gold," its framework is that of hypostatized forms suspended in absolute space-time. Earlier we saw instances of the use of "the" and "that" to make centrifugal reference in English poetry. Their closest analogue in Recent Style poetry is the demonstrative tz'u 1t "this." The appear- ance of tz'u in Regulated Verse follows a clearly discernible pattern: it occurs not in the first three couplets but only in the last. And its function is to provoke a sharp contrast between the absolute space- time of the previous couplets and the relative space-time of the last. The following poem by Tu Fu is quite typical. ~T het JEt / $ +1 E] f}rt WU fi* Q k? / ifL@ 4x Tr FEI igIHL1# / k3M'flhI AS* E] RW / 19W U A (560) I remember when I served as Censor free from care. This day last year I waited by His Majesty's side. Unicorn holds still, smoke from incense burner rises; Peacock opens up, shapes of unfolding fans are displayed. Jade tablets come from heaven's northern limit; Vermilion coats stay only in the center of the hall. In the lonely city, this day my heart almost breaks My sorrow faces cold clouds, snow fills the mountain. Lines 1 and 2 set the scene in the past. After that, the middle couplets exist in a world of absolute space-time, partly because vivid images are coupled with ambiguous meaning (lines 3 and 4), partly because the Chinese language lacks tense. The appearance of "this day" in line 7 abruptly dispels the mood of dreamy reminiscence, and ushers in, through the contrast between past and present, the new framework of relative time. In Li Shang-yin's celebrated "The Ornamented Zither," the use of tz'u is slightly different, but the effect is similar.8 8 James J. Y. Liu's translation in The Poetry of Li Shang-yin (Chicago, 1969), p. 51.</page><page sequence="41">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 89 The ornamented zither, for no reason, has fifty strings. Each string, each bridge, recalls a youthful year. Master Chuang was confused by his morning dream of the butterfly; Emperor Wang's amorous heart in spring is entrusted to the cuckoo. In the vast sea, under a bright moon, pearls have tears; On Indigo Mountain, in the warm sun, jade engenders smoke. This feeling might have become a thing to be remembered, Only, at the time you were already bewildered and lost. (622) Except for the fleeting mention of "youthful year" in line 2, the entire first six lines are devoid of realistic references to time or place, so that this poem, even more than the previous one, conveys from the very beginning that as yet undefined sense of unreality. The occur- rence of "this" (tz'u) in "this feeling" refers to the mood evoked in previous lines. Its use is centripetal, and hence different from the centrifugal use of "this" in "this day." "This feeling," in conjunction with "remember" and "at the time," defines the sense of unreality as that of the past remembered. By so doing, the last couplet of this poem achieves the very same effect as the last couplet of Tu Fu's poem, namely, to bring the poem from the misty freedom of reverie to the inescapable fixity of present awareness. This way of using tz'u evidently became a standard technique, since in addition to Tu Fu and Li Shang-yin, we also find the same pattern in other poets as well. What the above comparison shows is that the use of demonstratives in English poetry has the effect of accumulating details upon an ob- ject, whereas their use in Recent Style poetry-usually restricted to the final couplet-only serves to set forth the contrast between abso- lute space-time and relative space-time. 2.7 Theoretical Conclusions Our aim in this study is to analyze and characterize Recent Style poetry. To do so, we need a critical vocabulary. But critical terms cur- rently in use in the English-speaking world came into being, as they should, through the continuing discussion of Western poetry in gen- eral and English poetry in particular. When these terms are used in the discussion of Chinese poetry, they do not always fit. (For example, it is somewhat odd to call, as we did, a noun a simple image.) One alternative is to discuss Chinese poetry in traditional Chinese terms. But if we are writing in English for an English audience, that approach has the intrinsic disadvantage of trying to explain an unfamiliar poetic</page><page sequence="42">90 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN tradition by a set of critical terms equally unfamiliar. The more feas- ible solution, in our view, is to adopt the current critical vocabulary, but at the same time to become aware of, and thus neutralize, its built-in prejudices. In other words, once we choose to write about Chinese poetry in English, we have already taken the first but irrev- ocable step toward a general or comparative theory of poetry. We know we can never fully accomplish that task, but there is perhaps no harm in trying. By choice and by habit, our critical orientation is initially Empso- nian, in two important aspects. Empson, Richards, and their followers practice what has rightly been called linguistic criticism or linguistic analysis. Its central concern is to indicate how specific linguistic fea- tures are multiply effective in a poem. The form in which we gen- eralize this question is as follows: How can Recent Style poetry be characterized in terms of its language? Moreover, in the present study we are more interested in the elements that make up Recent Style poetry than individual poems as such. Linguistic analysis therefore assumes the task of calling attention to those features pervasively present and generally effective in Recent Style poetry. For example, the topic-topic-comment construction turns out to be a species of isolating syntax; and the quality orientation of simple images, effected through the modification of a noun by an adjective or another noun, finds a natural basis in the ever present binoms. Some of the charac- teristic features of Chinese can be most clearly seen through contrast with English. That is why in 2.6 we made a detour into English poetry. The terms "centrifugal" and "centripetal" were made popular by Northrop Frye, particularly in his Anatomy of Criticism (pp. 73ff.). This distinction marks the watershed between the so-called old criti- cism and New Criticism and is, therefore, central to another aspect of the position of Empson and Richards. The domain of philological criticism of the past may be defined as social context, historical back- ground, and literary sources-all of which, lying outside the poem itself, come under the term "centrifugal." What is new in New Criti- cism is the decisive turn of the critic's attention away from the out- ward direction. The proper concern of literary criticism, according to Empson, Frye, and many others, is the centripetal relations among words.</page><page sequence="43">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 91 But under scrutiny, the centripetal relation among words turns out to be constituted of two strands, syntactic and textural. What Hulme had in mind when he tried to banish syntax from poetry was the centripetal bonds imposed upon words by syntax. The contribution of Empson is to call attention to the textural relations among words. There is furthermore a clear sense in which texture is the inverse of syntax. When "setting sun" stands beside Theart" as two isolated words (in Tu Fu's line "setting sun, heart still hale"), there are at least three textural linkages: the heart is like the setting sun; the heart is unlike the setting sun; in the setting sun, the heart (is still hale). The basic function of grammar, in poetry and in ordinary dis- course, is simply to restrict the range of possible relations among words; when Tu Fu's line is translated into English as "In sunset hale of heart still," the addition of "in" firmly establishes "esunset" as the time-condition and relegates the other two readings to subsidiary roles. What this illustrates is the general principle that when syntax is weak, textural relations abound. In linguistic typology, Chinese is classified as an isolating or analytic language, and English and other European languages are classified as inflectional languages. This is one way of saying that the syntax of Chinese is weaker than that of English. In particular, Chinese has no tense, number, person, and all the morphological trappings that accompany such distinctions. When literary Chinese was transformed into an instrument of Recent Style poetry, most of the grammatical particles were left out; this process of elimination can be seen most clearly through a comparison with the Ancient Style poetry of the T'ang dynasty, which still made use of grammatical particles. The fact that Chinese syntax, already weak, is weakened further has two consequences. The slots formerly occupied by %empty words" (grammatical particles) are now taken over by content words (nouns and verbs) -a change which endows Recent Style poetry with its characteristic compactness and density. Since there are even fewer grammatical constraints in Recent Style poetry, ambiguity is the norm instead of the exception. The applicability of Empsonian analysis to this type of poetry follows directly from the facts just stated. When we reflect upon the centrifugal or outward drive of words, we discover that it too is constituted of more than one kind. There is,</page><page sequence="44">92 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN in the first place, the preoccupation with exact reference which was once the hallmark of philological criticism, for example: Who is the dark lady in Shakespeare's sonnets? What needs to be said about this type of criticism can be said briefly. A certain amount of information about extrinsic circumstances is indispensible to the intrinsic study of literature, some of these facts can never be fully ascertained, and beyond a certain point, no new fact is likely to enhance our apprecia- tion of a literary work. Having disposed of this sense of "centrifugal," we are still left with the most interesting problem. A set of nonsense syllables strung together solely for the sake of euphony differs from a poem precisely because the latter has meaning. When the New Critic asserts that a certain line in a poem conveys, suggests, or implies something, that something is again meaning. The New Critic is not denying that a line or a poem has a literal meaning; he is or should be saying that above and beyond the literal meaning, there is another level of meaning, often far more important, generated by the interaction of words. Now, to say that a poem conveys meaning by its statements and by its gestures is to say that it has a centrifugal drive, and the task of poetics is to analyze this centrifugal drive in terms of its origin and its des- tination. Percept, as distinguished from concept, is one kind of meaning which words may have, and in poetry this is called imagery. Under imagery we distinguished two types, one oriented toward objects and the other toward qualities. This classification is in terms of destina- tion. The origin of these two types is to be sought in diction and syntax. Thus the simple image in Recent Style poetry is oriented toward qualities for the following reasons. Since nouns in Chinese take neither the definite article nor the indefinite article, and admit no distinction in number, they stand for types and not individuals. The language of Recent Style poetry is rich in isolative constructions but poor in accumulative processes. Hence a noun can easily achieve independence and become the vehicle of a simple image. Unencum- bered by details, the noun-image serves little of the functions associ- ated with realistic representation. In terms of diction, let us recall that the majority of disyllabic nominal compounds consists of two elements, one of which indicates a sensory quality or a perceiving sense. There are also disyllabic nouns such as P'i-pa "guitar" or</page><page sequence="45">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 93 feng-huang "phoenix" which conjure up visual or auditory qualities all by themselves. The simple images occur in a context pervaded by contrasts of various sorts-antithetical relation between the two lines of a couplet and textural linkages within a line or extending into the poem as a whole-all of which either emphasize the qualities explicitly indicated by adjectives or actualize the qualities implicit in nouns. To summarize: Under centripetal relations, we recognize syntax and texture. Among centrifugal relations, we distinguish the drive toward objects and the drive toward qualities. In terms of these two pairs of distinction we may characterize two types of poetry as follows. Recent Style poetry is weak in syntax, strong in texture, with images oriented toward qualities. English poetry, in which syntax serves as the dominant principle of organization intermediate between texture and structure, is realistic in its mode of presentation, with imagery oriented toward objects. Underlying much of our discussion are the issues raised by the theory and practice of Imagism. It seems appropriate at this time to cast a backward glance. First, Hulme's insight is to notice the intimate connection between syntax and imagery. But his view that syntax hinders image making is two half-truths thrown together. Here it is important to distinguish between simple image and complex imagery. It is equally important to distinguish between the isolating syntax of Chinese and the accumu- lating and linking syntax of English. ("eLinking" is just our shorthand for what others have called the "sinew and strength" of English syntax.) The truth in Hulme's view is this: the isolating syntax of Chinese favors the making of simple images, and since Chinese syntax is intrinsically isolative, there is no need to abolish syntax in order to facilitate image making. The accumulating and linking syntax of Eng- lish does hinder the making of simple images, but it also aids the creation of complex imagery. When this aspect of English syntax is abolished, we get Imagist poetry. But the price paid is to give up complex imagery as well as the many other functions English syntax is capable of performing. Secondly, our theory also puts another aspect of Fenollosa's view in perspective. Fenollosa believed that Chinese written characters are eminently suitable as a medium of poetry, since one can see pictures in the characters. This is clearly nonsense; yet useful nonsense. What</page><page sequence="46">94 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN he noticed is that, unlike words in English poetry, the smallest unit in Chinese-namely, the individual character-is capable of image making. But Fenollosa assigned the wrong cause; isolative syntax, instead of pictographic writing, endows the smallest units with the degree of autonomy they enjoy. Finally, Imagism raised an issue central to the theory of imagery: what kind of language must be used in order to make an effective image? The answer it gives is obscure at first sight and under closer scrutiny shows unmistakable traces of nominalistic prejudice: by using concrete language in image making, poetry endeavors "to make you continuously see a physical thing." The obscurity lies in the word e"concrete." Is it concrete with respect to sensory impression ("vivid") or with respect to centrifugal reference ("specific")? These two senses are almost always confused in Imagist theory and frequently in prac- tice. "Rose, harsh rose, marred and with stint of petals" is nomi- nalism incarnate; it is at once vivid and specific; it gives the impression that no other rose will do. Moreover, in Wordsworth's "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" we find the same technique at work in the descrip- tion of the daffodils. Between Imagist and pre-Imagist poetry there is a difference between sharp and soft focus, but the view in both is fo- cused on a concrete object. The root lies much deeper. The English language, with its number and tense, definite and indefinite article, governance and concord, and various sorts of accumulative construc- tions, is referentially concrete. Thus by and large, when we talk about imagery in English poetry, the confusion between the two senses of e"concrete" is inconvenient, but not debilitating. In contrast, Chinese is a referentially abstract language. When that property is exploited in Recent Style poetry, we get in its imagistic part, a distinct sense of unreality. (Recall the poems by Tu Fu and Li Shang-yin discussed in 2.6.) The scene has no realistic spatial-tem- poral location. If a noun does not refer to this or that individual, it is because its reference is not an individual but a type. At the same time, through its plenum of quality-evoking words a Recent Style poem does achieve vividness in its imagery. The characteristic copresence of concreteness in sensory impression and abstractness in reference in Recent Style poetry, then, may be regarded as a significant counter example to the Imagist theory of image making.</page><page sequence="47">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 95 3. VERB AND THE DYNAMIC IMAGE 3.1 Introduction According to Fenollosa, the transference of power in nature is re- flected in the form of "farmer pound rice," a transitive sentence whose word order is agent-action-object. We agree with him in principle, and wish to raise several questions. First, while "farmer pound rice') conveys activity, it can hardly be regarded the epitome of the dy- namic. How then is the dynamic image formed? What are the degrees of dynamism? What are the linguistic features capable of evoking action and change? Secondly, "to pound" is a transitive verb. But not all transitive verbs are dynamic, even less so the rest of the verbs. What other functions do verbs perform? Thirdly, Fenollosa charac- terizes the transference of power and its grammatical analogue as passing between two terms. The basic idea is connection, of which causal action is just one special form. How, in general, are separate objects connected in poetry? All these questions are important for the study of Recent Style poetry. The Chinese had a vivid awareness of the vital process in nature, an awareness which found expression in the classics of Con- fucianism and Taoism alike. Thus the Book of Change says, "give birth to living things without cease" (4 4 .F), and the Lao Tzu says, "Tao gives birth to One; One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth to Three; Three gives birth to all the myriad things." A concept so deeply rooted in the Chinese way of thought must surely be ex- pressed in Chinese poetry, and it is perhaps because these two lines of Hsieh Ling-yiin encapsuled the idea of vitality in nature that they enjoyed enduring fame: "The pond bank grows spring grass; garden willows change singing birds" : / N #0nM.. The last line is a case of inversion, "In the garden willows, singing birds change (from one kind to another)." In Chinese art criticism, a common term of praise for a painting that comes alive is XM4LJIR "the spirit and mood (take on) life and movement." How an essentially static art form such as painting (not necessarily a scroll) can convey life and movement is a question be- yond the scope of this study. But an analogous problem arises in poetry. Earlier we saw the ubiquitous presence of simple images in Recent Style poetry. A poem consisting of noun-images alone is</page><page sequence="48">96 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN necessarily disconnected and static. It sets forth the universal for our contemplation; but without the means to present a concrete event of noteworthy interest, it cannot move or stir us. In short, it lacks the various features which make a poem come alive: vital processes hap- pening in nature and dynamic interconnection between individual agents. Ideally the dynamic image should contain all these, and in the following example it comes quite close to doing so. ~~ ~/ filwAi V 1 Vf rwi:r / Pi; 1m 1_z 9- g+!U2 / JiJ 'tll&lt;j i Fine grass, slight wind bank / Precipitous mast, solitary night boat. Star hang (down), wild plain (is) vast / Moon gush, great river flow. (486) There is a sharp contrast between the static sense of the first couplet and the dynamic sense of the second. The first two lines are made up entirely of simple images in juxtaposition. The little connection there is comes about through texture, through the similarity in qualities; "efine" and "slight" mean "small"; "precipitous" and "esolitary" mean "singular." The stage is set, but there is no action. The next two lines are both N V, NV. While the first verbs ("ehang"' and 'Cgush") are not transitive, they do pass through two terms. Each of these lines traces the same motion as the conductor beating 3/4 time; in one sweeping movement, down and sideways, the star is connected to the plain, and the moon to the river. "The star droops onto the vast plain spreading out; the moon gushes into the great river flow- ing." There is also a difference in the degree of dynamism. Line 3 outlines the contour and prefigures the movement. Line 4 consum- mates the movement, conveying a powerful image of cosmic power pulsating in and through the moon and the great river. In the above analysis, we used the two basic categories in Chinese metaphysics, c tung "dynamic" and Ot ching "static." A similar analysis applies to another poem by Tu Fu. L H1ff- ih /Y FIR E% 'X@JHlm / 80'w1.Z Slow sun river-mountain beautiful / Spring wind flower-bird fragrant Clay thaw fly swallow / Sand warm sleep mandarin duck. (CTS, 2475)</page><page sequence="49">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 97 The first two lines express the static and the universal; "river- mountain" and "flower-bird" are archetypal nouns; the adjectives Tbeautiful" and "fragrant," here used as stative verbs (in English 'care beautiful" and "are fragrant"), convey static qualities. The final two lines inject life and movement into the poem. How? Each line contains an inversion; "fly" and "sleep" precede their subjects, though in normal word order they should come after. These lines can be read two ways. The first is to take "fly" as a causative verb; the thawing of clay announces the nest building season and thus causes the swallows to fly. In this reading, the transference of power that we feel is expressed objectively, through the word order of agent-action- object. ("Clay thaw" is a sub-sentence serving as the subject-agent of the entire sentence.) Alternatively, we may read the line as an instance of simple inversion, "Clay thaws, fly the swallows," in which case the sense of power has a subjective source. Let us see why. Our concept of power in nature is closely allied with our kinesthetic and motor sensation of pushing against a resistant object or breaking through an obstacle. As David Hume would have it, the former is just a projection of the latter, a case of anthropomorphism. When we break through an obstruction, we feel a sense of power; the greater the obstruction, the greater the sense of power. Now, inversion, like any type of syntactic dislocation, places obstruction in our path. In the process of un- raveling the sense and overcoming the obstruction, we experience a quiver of power, which is automatically projected back into the poem. These two readings thus mirror the twin seats of power, Ego and the World, though when we are fully absorbed in the poem, we only feel the dynamic impact without being conscious of its diverse sources. So far we have sketched the intellectual background of the concept of creative process and given a few illustrations of its manifestation in poetry. In 3.3 we shall indicate how the dynamic image is formed in Recent Style poetry. Before we take up that question, however, it seems appropriate to sharpen our focus a bit. It is well known that Chinese grammar has no tense. Literary Chinese has aspect particles such as 4- i, but they seldom occur in Recent Style poetry. Other aspect particles now in prevalent use either had not yet come into the language at the time of the T'ang dynasty or were just beginning to make a tentative appearance, for example i che, T le, X kuo.9 In 9 3EJJ, &amp;-V (at'fl?, Peking, 1958), pp. 304-312.</page><page sequence="50">98 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN short, the language of Recent Style poetry is deficient in explicit markers of time. On the other hand, what we have variously called life and movement, action and dynamism, vital process and trans- ference of power, are all versions of change. Change can only occur in time, and when a specific change takes place, it divides the tem- poral continuum into past, present, and future. How, then, in the absence of explicit markers of tense can Recent Style poetry convey change? This will be the main problem for this section. It will soon become apparent that in our view the verb constitutes the basic, indispensable ingredient of the dynamic image, and our efforts will be directed towards establishing a typology of Chinese verbs and their varying degrees of dynamism. But clearly not all verbs are dynamic. The question then naturally arises as to what poetic functions do these nondynamic verbs perform. That will be the topic for the next section, entitled "Static Verbs." 3.2 Static Verbs As a preliminary, let us note that the title of this section, "Static Verbs," is actually a misnomer. Some verbs such as the copula shih are intrinsically static (just as some English verbs are strong and others are weak). Other verbs have both a static and dynamic aspect. Each of these aspects can assume prominence, if the verb occurs in a certain type of context or if it is analyzed from a selective perspective. A more accurate title would be "Static verbs and the static aspect of other verbs." Unlike English, the adjective in Chinese occurs in the predicate position without the copula, in which case it is called the stative verb. Stative verbs usually indicate qualities. In the last couplet dis- cussed "In the slow (moving) sun, river and mountain (are) beautiful; in the spring wind, flower and bird (are) fragrant," no trace of activity can be detected in the two stative verbs themselves. In 7iiJiJM r it "water azure, sand brilliant, two banks of moss" (81o), the line slides from N Adj, N Adj, to N N with no perceptible variation in its static tone. Similarly, in 4M YZN V:i2 "pheasants fly, deer pass by, fragrant grass afar" (6i8), each of the three phrases depicts part of a tranquil rustic scene, although the predicate is constituted of an in- transitive verb in the first two phrases and a stative verb in the last. In contexts such as these, the adjective, whether occurring as the modi-</page><page sequence="51">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 99 fier of a noun or as the attributive predicate, presents merely a sensory quality. The quality orientation of nouns is emphasized by the abstract nouns eccolor" and "sound," which specify the perceiving organ and direct the reader to the quality to be perceived. They have counter- parts in verbs which point to the sensory transaction either at its origin or at its terminus. Such verbs differ in degree of effort and activity, partly because Classical Chinese differentiates between task and achievement. In Mencius, TLook without seeing; listen without hearing" MUffiriLF; TffiT&gt;, the first verb in each statement is the task verb, the second is the achievement verb whose modern equiva- lent is the resultative verb k'an chien, t'ing chien. An achievement may be entirely effortless as in T'ao Ch'ien's famous line V'J-i,iiLi "Casually see South Mountain." Wang Wei's MAI T"Facing wind listen (to) evening cicada" (422) conveys more effort because "listen" is a task word. JAVA f l / )T.' 1BJ "Wind sings the trees of both banks; Moon shines upon one solitary boat" (438) sug- gests power through its causative "sings." Such differences notwith- standing, all these verbs emphasize perceptible qualities: the bright- ness of the moon, the rustling of leaves, the singing of cicadas. How verbs and nouns work together to emphasize qualities may be seen in Tu Mu's couplet ,%LIIl-t1 / AJ k} 7tZ*tP "Birds come and go in the hillscape; men sing and cry amidst the water sound" (618). "Come and go" describes the way birds fly in the purely visual first line, a line keyed to se e-scape"; "sing and cry" indicate the species of sound in the purely auditory second line, a line keyed to sheng "sound." Closely allied to verbs of perception are verbs of cognition, which also accentuate the mood or quality appre- hended. In 1n4 ' / hWA} -i4J3 t "By trademen's day- time nap (one) knows the waves are still; through boatmen's night time chatter (one) realizes the tide has risen" (603), "knows" empha- sizes the quiescence of "sleep" and "still," and "realize" emphasizes the activity of "chatter" and "rise." In WSO / #1fiM** ThBy blue (one) knows beyond-the-lake grass / By red (one) sees east-of- the-sea cloud" (CTS, 2527), the qualities accentuated are colors. The point to be made about verbs of perception and cognition is analogous to what we said earlier about nonrestrictive adjectives such as Tbright" in "bright moon." The view presented in a line must in some sense</page><page sequence="52">100 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN be seen by the poet. The use of superfluous verbs such as "see" or "know" do not present an additional fact but serve to emphasize the facts already presented. Verbs of posture and location aid the visual imagination and are thus also primarily static. A ready test is whether one can illustrate a line by a painting. Li Po's [ti W h t White head reclines (amidst) pines and clouds" (456) clearly passes this test. In addition to "re- cline," verbs of posture include "stand," Cesit," t"lean," t"droop," I lie down" (7i', 4k {V', A, OXJ). Verbs of location may be illustrated by Xii-4J i@ii L -lYellow River far above among the white clouds" (796). Here shang is a verb of position with the primary emphasis on the static; "above" therefore seems a more apt translation than Cerise." There is also a category of verbs which may be considered the static version of transitive verbs. They occur between two nouns but lack dynamic action. We will call them connective verbs. The copula shih is a prime example. Now, beginning with Fenollosa and Pound, and probably before, the copula has acquired a bad name. And in indicting the copula in English, theorists of poetic language not in- frequently stress the fact that Chinese poetry gets along superbly without the copula and indeed benefited from its absence. This view requires qualification. The copula does occur in Recent Style poetry. When it does, it states an equation between two terms, and at the same time conveys what lies outside and rebels against the equation. In other words, "eis" implies "is not" or "may not be." WAIWFMA / HE= ffi W%fitZMA / *ffiXMOMA (838) "Thinking only of their vows of crushing the Huns / five thousand soldiers, clad in sable and silk, fell in the Tartar dust. / Oh! pity the bones by the shores of Wu Ting River, which are still the men in their loved ones' boudoir dreams." The poem achieves its ironic effect through two denouements, in opposite directions-from patriotic rhetoric to unceremonial death and then from neglected bones to fond dreams. The copula shih serves an essential function; it says "still are" but implies "have been but are no longer," the exact opposite.</page><page sequence="53">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 101 *9 SXJ &amp; / _* kfiA (8 7) "The ferry at Chin Ling, a small building on the hill. / One night's stopover, traveller must be sad. / Under the slanted moon, tide ebbs in the night river; / Two three specks of light are Kua-chou." The poem was written when the poet, on his way to Kua-chou on the northern shore of the Yangtze, had to stop over at Chin Ling (Nan- king) just across the river. The night is illuminated only by the crescent moon, much too dark to make out anything. Thus in equating the two or three specks of light with Kua-chou by the copula shih, the poet confesses self-doubt while seeking reassurance. In Li Po's 4Xf&amp;li ! )1 )i / M;tdi jt "Bright moon light before the bed / is, I sus- pect, frost on the ground" (764), the ambiguity in the equation is explicitly marked by i "(I) suspect." Po Chiu-i ends a quatrain with this line V1S V1 l-WON "Just hope that Ping-chou is the home- town" (826). The poet has been sojourning in Ping-chou, away from home, for ten years. The unfortunate fact that Ping-chou is not his home is now stated ironically via the intrinsic ambiguity of shih. When nouns are juxtaposed, they naturally enter into textural al- liances, among which are equivalence and similarity, contrast and opposition. With the introduction of the copula, one relation becomes the first among erstwhile equals, thus triggering a reaction in the opposite direction. The same principle explains why Recent Style poetry contains innumerable metaphors but few similes. MiCT-; / f H R-A kI "Floating cloud, wandering son's mood; Setting sun, old acquaintance's sentiment" (457). The forward momentum is suffi- cient to bring the two nouns in each line into a metaphoric relation: "Floating cloud is like the wandering son's mood...." Simile-making verbs such as W., ArJ"appear, seem, like" are thus superfluous if the purpose is merely to indicate similarity. However, e'appear" and "seem" imply "is not," and "like" suggests "unlike in some other respects"; they all veer into the opposite. This duplicity indeed marks their occurrence in Recent Style poetry. ~wmgXS / Wa5Jg4R</page><page sequence="54">102 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN By Hsi Yuan the post road begins at the end of the city's wall; Travellers scatter from the river pavilion, rain drizzles on. You sir, try to gaze above the Fen River and see (If) the white clouds are still like those of Han time's autumn. (807) The final two lines echo a poem by Emperor Wu of Han, and are suffused with tradition. White clouds of course remain the same from one dynasty to the next. Hence by the explicit use of ssu "(are) like," the poet injects a note of uncertainty-that the passage of time may even have altered the white clouds above the Fen River. The following two lines by Tu Fu occur in the middle of a poem entitled "The Lone Wild Goose": VZS1PA / V-_A; 1t "His gaze exhausted, he seems to see still; with many sorrows, he seems to hear again" (489). The lone goose has been separated from its flock. The use of ssu and ju " seem"l convey the intensity of his despair because these words, through their built-in ambiguity, at once indicate the illusion of seeing and hearing the flock and the fact that the flock can never be found again. Another type of connective verb serves to link together otherwise unrelated objects in space. / 4'I{A "Six Dynasties arts and artifacts, grass linked (to) the void" (617); X MO*wk "The mouth of Ch'ii-t'ang gorges, the head of Crooked River / Ten thousand miles of wind-mist link the pallid autumn" (587). The connectives in these lines are verbs, lien and chieh "con- nect, link." Other spatial connectives are coverbs: UMMARXV / W?JtIIJ3I~ ll- l"The waves between the river banks to the sky surge; Wind-cloud above the passes meeting the ground overcast" (581); i U tll&amp; 1 "White sun by the mountain vanishes" (762). In "Six Dynasties arts and artifacts, grass linked to the void," the first part conjures up the cultural activities flourishing in the past, and the second part depicts the present wasteland, with grass linked to the sky. The form of the line suggests, through the juxtaposition of these two parts, the distance between past and present. Tu Fu's couplet "The mouth of Ch'i-t'ang gorges, the head of Crooked River / Ten thousand miles of wind-mist links the pallid autumn" is built upon a similar plan. The relation between the two parts of the first line and between the two lines is that of juxtaposition, mimetic of the poet's</page><page sequence="55">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 103 condition of being separated from his home. The second line ap- parently presents a different kind of image, that of connectedness. But JW3l is homonymous with , both pronouncedfeng-yen, and the latter, meaning "beacon," the traditional symbol of war, is the cause of the poet's being separated from his home. Thus in both instances, the image of connection is separated from and juxtaposed against the icon of separation. The only difference is that what takes Tu Fu two lines to accomplish, Tu Mu does in one. There is a general reason why verbs and coverbs of connection are effective. Connectedness in space makes distance, and distance is an agent of separation. Thus spatial connectives, like the copula and simile-making verbs ("seem," "like," "appear"), have a built-in pos- sibility for ambiguity. 3.3 Dynamic Features Linguistic features capable of injecting life and movement into an image will be discussed under seven headings: (i) extended usage, (2) stative verbs, (3) time and place words, (4) temporal adverbs, (5) transitive verbs, (6) inversion, (7) causative and pivotal construc- tions. 3.3. 1 Extended Usage and Novel Observation Adjectives are in general static. But when an adjective enters into a novel alliance, the line thus constituted may yet make the entire poem come alive. In XH WX Y "beach moon, shattered-light flows" (500), 4 "shattered" used as an adjectival description of the moonlight reflecting off sand and gravel is both fitting and striking. In %-M IM. "Solitary lamp coldly shines on the rain" (500), the adjective "cold," here used as an adverb, aptly encapsules an synaes- thetic experience. These lines illustrate two varieties of extended usage; the first extends the semantic domain, the second extends the word class. Extendedusage isnotlimited merely to adjectives.A4iT 3A'kTfron- tier grass (in) summer first autumns" (418); the use of "autumn" as a verb brings out vividly the dryness and barrenness of the frontier land. kJWJT * / WAAAktl "Fading sun sinks below the bushes, dis- tant burning enters the autumn hill" (516); here "distant burning" is the sun and "burn" has been converted from a verb to a noun. Earlier we saw that the diction of Recent Style poetry generally</page><page sequence="56">104 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN favors common words and time-tested expressions. Their presence, like that of Homeric epithets and stereotypes, endows the poem with a sense of solidity and familiarity. Against this background, when a fresh observation appears clothed in novel language, it leaps to the eye. The above examples also illustrate something far more important. Each of them conveys a distinct sense that the event described is unique and can only occur under a very special circumstance. Why is this important? In discussing simple images we pointed out that Chinese nouns as a rule only have general reference, though their degree of generality may differ. Cumulative syntax, demonstrative articles, and other grammatical features endow English nouns with specific reference, but such devices are absent in Chinese. How then does a Recent Style poem indicate the specific? In our preliminary exploration of the verbal predicate we also asked the question: In the absence of tense and aspect markers, how does a poem convey time and change? Now we would like to introduce the general principle that specificity and temporariness are mutually implicative in Recent Style poetry, thus answering two basic questions at once. The princi- ple apparently does not hold for English poetry, since "the lilacs where the robins built . . ." and "Rose, harsh rose, marred and with stint of petals" are specific but also static. But in Recent Style poetry, as we shall try to show, the principle is more often valid than not. Universals (dogness) cannot move, only individuals (Fido) can. From this it follows that insofar as Chinese nouns are close approximations of universals, no movement can come of them alone. An insect by the side of a hungry frog tries to blend into the environment by holding absolutely still. The moment the insect makes a movement, it reveals itself as a specific individual, thus catching the attention of the frog. What the frog notices is an individual that stands out by its movement from the environment, though it may not know whether the insect is a grasshopper or a fly. In other words, whenever there is movement, there is an individual alive and moving. (This of course does not pre- vent the moving individual from being the concrete universal of cosmic power.) Conversely, our sense of time depends upon specific events; when nothing happens, when we are imprisoned in a per- petually darkened room, we lose track of time. Thus as long as speci- ficity is centered in events and not in objects, that variety of specificity implies temporariness.</page><page sequence="57">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 105 In the examples cited above, the novel use of words is itself a con- tributing factor of lively description. In addition, "distant burn," "shattered light," etc. through their novelty call attention to the uniqueness of the events they describe. Nevertheless, the life and movement conveyed by these lines are relatively weak. Why? As Fenollosa has pointed out, action has the verb as its primary vehicle. In the above examples, however, the novel and the dynamic have separate loci; in "distant burn enters autumn hill," for example, "burn" is a novel use of a verb as a noun, but the main verb "enters" is neutral and quite ordinary. In the next section, we will see how the coincidence of the novel and the specific in the verb generates a stronger degree of dynamism. Finally, we should add a word of clarification about the meaning of "novel observation" or "novel event." "Novel" does not mean some- thing no one else has seen; otherwise empathy would be difficult or impossible. An observation is novel if it has not been included as part of the standard poetic expression. A shock of recognition not infre- quently accompanies our encounter with a novel image; we have seen the thing before, the description is apt, now we re-cognize it. 3.3.2 Stative Verbs, Intransitive Verbs, and Couplets in Parallel Con- struction In pentasyllabic Recent Style poetry, there is a prevalent type of construction for couplets. In each line, the first two syllables name a condition, the next three syllables describe the event which takes place under that condition. The final three syllables consist of two syllables representing the noun-subject, followed by a stative verb or an intransitive verb. Thus schematically: 1 2 3 4 5 subject action condition consequence In addition, the two lines in the couplet have the same construction- of the type described above. In a Regulated Verse, this type of couplet occurs with great frequency in the middle part of the poem; in fact, every major T'ang poet has left famous couplets in this form. Our main purpose here is to point out its dynamic possibilities. HXIU1 i / " "Sun set, river-lake white; tide come,</page><page sequence="58">106 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN heaven-earth blue" (430). In Chinese, condition and consequence is often expressed by one sentence following another, without any logi- cal words such as "if-then" or "since." The sense is "as the sun sets, river and lake turn white," or ". . . river and lake become white." How do we get the feeling of change, expressed as "turn" or "be- come" in the English translation? From two sources. First, white is the color which rivers and lakes take on when the sun sets, and "become" expresses this causal linkage. Moreover, the crisscrossing of colors sets forth two specific events which obtain under unusual circum- stances. Rivers and lakes are usually green or blue, but here they are white; heaven is always blue, earth is not, but in any case their present blueness is due to the tide. Now, just as two points define a Euclidean line, so two unique events define a slice of time. These events, there- fore, convey temporariness; only during that brief period of time can both events occur simultaneously. This sense of change in process is the second source for "become" or "turn." This example and the rest to follow are also important for our general theory. Earlier we noted that stative verbs are generally static: the example cited in 3.2, "The water clear, the sand bright, moss on two banks," shows that Noun StVb can easily slide into Noun while maintaining the overall static tone; the scene is viewed under the guise of eternity. Here we are making a major qualification: the Noun StVb construction, as in "river-lake white" and "heaven-earth blue," does sometimes convey temporariness. The difference lies in the condition- consequence construction and the mutual reinforcement of tempo- rariness achieved through the couplet form. This example also illus- trates a clear-cut division of labor. "Heaven-earth" and "river-lake" are archetypal nouns that express the universal. The specific is con- veyed through the verbal predicate and the sentential form. StthfThtX / 3k W4( "Earth flat, desolate wilderness vast; sky distant, evening river tardy" (480). The grammatical construction is exactly the same; there is also a similar use of archetypal nouns. The sense is that "When the terrain is flat, the desolate wilderness be- comes more vast than usual; as the sky is far away, it takes longer for the river to flow there." Here the novel use of ch'ih "tardy, late" as the attributive predicate of "river" makes the scene even more specific. But the sense of being unique and different requires neither unique event (blue and white crisscrossed) nor novel language (river is</page><page sequence="59">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 107 tardy). A special condition will serve just as well, as the following example shows: lItiJ;A / J V*M "Nation shattered, moun- tain-river exist / city spring, grass-tree deep" (470). Tsai "exist" is a weak verb commonly avoided in Chinese poetry, but whenever it is used, its intrinsic tendency to veer into the opposite comes to the fore. The existence of river and mountain is usually taken for granted. But when the nation is shattered, it surprises and even pains the observer to find river and mountain remaining-in spite of the de- struction. There is, therefore, a noticeable suggestion that although river and mountain still exist, they may not for long. "Spring,)' like e"autumn" in an earlier example, is a noun used as a verb, and the implied temporal sense calls for such a translation as "As Spring comes to the city, grass and leaves grow thick." In D #* DPd / 8X .W;$ "Grass withers, eagle's eyes sharpen / snow vanishes, horse's hoofs lighten" (433), the two lines are again in the condition-conse- quence construction. ItiffX . ?I / &amp;GAAETZ "Fine drizzle, fish come out; light wind, swallows tilt" (CTS, 2455). The only difference here is that the condi- tion is expressed by an Adj-N compound, and ch'u "come out" is an intransitive verb. AAM 0T / AjP-R1II;MI "Great desert, solitary smoke straight; long river, setting sun round" (435). The scene is set on a vast desert, very flat and very still. "Great desert" and "long river" state the condition; "straight" and "round" indicate the spe- cial effect-special because the smoke and the sun are not always seen as straight and round; only under these circumstances do they appear as such. It is also essential that the right stative verbs occur at the place reserved for action. Change the lines to "Great desert, straight smoke is solitary; long river, round sun is setting" and we get anticlimax; after the condition is stated, no consequence follows. This confirms a principle stated earlier: only if the novel and the specific coincide in the verb does the line acquire momentum. Contemporaneity may be conveyed without the couplet form. "The moon sets, a crow flies, frost fills the sky," for example, is a line whose three components, being contemporaneous events, define the time as predawn. Similarly, the idea of consequence can also be expressed in forms other than those exemplified above. In E IE A T);-Ti / mi TW E"river move, moon transports stone; brook shallow, cloud nears</page><page sequence="60">108 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN flower" (CTS, 2487), the first half of each line states the condition, but the consequence is now in the form noun + verb + noun; "as the river moves, the reflected moon budges the stones; as the brook is shallow, the reflected clouds nudge the flowers." The same construc- tion is exemplified in ; / iIU- 14 )IA "As the plain is vast, the sky lowers the trees; as the river is clear, the moon gets close to man." Causation and contemporaneity, then, are mutually independ- ent. But when they appear together, as they do in couplets consisting of two condition-consequence lines in parallel construction, they rein- force each other's dynamic impact. 3.3.3 Time and Place Words Time and place words emphasize the perspective in which an event is viewed and consequently also its temporariness. The scene depicted in the following couplet is otherwise quite common: H I? T Ws * / (a: b1Lir P "The sun rises beyond the cold mountain; the river flows amidst last night's fog" (483). But the addition of "cold mountain" and "last night's fog" transform "sun rise" and "river flow" from the general to the particular. The same analysis applies to Wang Wei's famous couplet YbtL52'tV / WJ INE1I kr "The river's flow beyond heaven and earth; the mountain's color between being and nonbeing" (432). Here, even though yu wu "being and nonbeing" is a highly abstract concept, to couple it with the mountain color makes the static image stand out. In AMR fl "The morning bell is moist beyond the clouds" (CTS, 2494), several features combine to convey speci- ficity: the place word "beyond the clouds" defines the place; "morn- ing" defines the time; the description of the bell sound as wet is extended usage. The bell sound, which originates from the temple on top of the mountain, is moistened by the clouds as it travels down to the poet in the boat. Another case of synaesthesia is VAUI*-9f "Blue tile beyond the first chill" (CTS, 2387); here "first chill" is a cross between a place word and a time word. Just about any kind of noun can serve as an indicator of place. In Li Po's line cited before, "Mountain comes up from man's face; cloud rises beside horse's head," ccome up" and "rise" convey action, while "man's face" and "horse's head" define the exact location. In the last section we discussed spatial and temporal conditions, e.g., "Great desert, solitary smoke straight; long river, setting sun round." Such conditions are obviously close relatives of time and</page><page sequence="61">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 109 place words discussed in this section. The only difference lies in the fact that time and place words occur after the noun-subject. They are marked by localizers such as chung "amidst" and wai "beyond" and are more limited in usage. 3.-.4 Temporal Adverbs The shape and contour of events are usually expressed by aspect particles, in Classical Chinese and modern Chinese alike. However, in Recent Style poetry, which seldom employs aspect particles, that function is performed almost exclusively by temporal adverbs. Earlier we saw two examples of such adverbs: "Spring wind again greens Yangtze's southern shore," and "Sunset heart still hale; autumn wind, illness about to heal" (1.2 and 1.4). It remains to illustrate their range and variety. "Again" expresses change; "still" expresses persistence. They represent two main aspects of time and define our two categories. (A) Adverbs of change: ai I.O "We (friends) again ascend the heights" (440) S~L~YL$ ;e"Suddenly pass through Hsin-feng City" (433) -rl1 V X "First see Censer Peak" (440) f5f "eOnce before read Master Yuan's biography" (440) ti4gff "Wandering girl formerly untied (her) pendant" (445) 4 t g 4 t ffi "From time to time, falling petals come" (445) bm+% e "White hair scratch even shorter" (470) 4ty nA "Already near the sad, cold month" (479) fIVEI~t{3EA "Spring color just arrives from the east" (495) l*1_1T? "At an enlightened time, and only then is talent treasured" (495) *A1rk3%L* "When spring wind blows, [the grass] will again come to life" (505) (B) Adverbs of persistence: 7-x "Always think of the footprints beyond this earthly dust" (440) ;zE,gX "Long remains in the Chinese encampment" (413) 9tM "Often return with Emperor's draw-cart" (454) i Kg- "Every time go out from the inner palace" (454) B Th v*;iE "Left home, and for long did not return" (5i6) "ai- 0 "F[Thinking of] my grand achievement, [I] look again and again at the mirror [to see my aged face]" (487) XZ?gm_ "The gaze exhausted, [the flock] appears still visible [to the lost wild duck]" (489)</page><page sequence="62">110 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN 3.3.5 Transitive Verbs The idea basic to the transitive verb is dynamic connection. It is energy reaching out from the subject to the object. Hence the senten- tial form that most perfectly reflects this transference of power is one complete with the subject, the verb, and the object. While the subject is often omitted in Chinese, we can still recognize a verb as transitive by the object following it, though in this case, the dynamic impact is somewhat diminished. Connection, as we argued earlier, is an even more basic idea; with- out the connective service of verbs, a poem would be reduced to a collection of juxtaposed nouns. Static connection has been discussed earlier, in 3.2, with special reference to the copula and simile-making verbs such as "appear" and "seem." Here we shall resume the argu- ment; we shall analyze transitive verbs in terms of the degree and variety of dynamism in addition to their connective function. Human sense organs differ from the tentacles of lower organisms in that the former do not move overtly. But our eyes and ears do reach out to the external world. Verbs of perception such as chien "see" and wen "hear" represent achievement and are therefore static. Others require more effort and energy. In PDR0,449 "Facing the wind, listen to evening cicadas" (422) and 1J t Yo W "In the boudoir, look at [the moon] all by oneself" (469), the task verbs "listen to" and "look at" project a much stronger sense of reaching out. Even stronger are verbs of emotion such as "pity," "recall," "feel," and "hate": A *'J'%QA "From afar, pity the small children" (469), )OX* "In vain recalls General Hsieh "(462), 9WWA&amp;M / iY?JA,*.b "Moved by the times, flowers (make me) shed tears; hating separation, birds startle (my) heart" (470). Here reaching out has turned into longing. The dynamic counterpart of location is locomotion, and verbs of locomotion serve to connect dynamically objects in space. TIN t iNJ19E "Traveling tumbleweed cover exit Chinese fort; return- ing goose enter Tartar sky" (435). Here "exit" and "enter" connect the tumbleweed to the forts, and the wild geese to the sky. But while the connections effected by perceptual, emotive, and locomotive verbs are dynamic, they are in another sense neutral; they fail to affect or transform the object. For the latter type of dynamic connection, we need to turn to another variety of transitive verb.</page><page sequence="63">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 111 %ARVN / a IAVIZ "Air evaporates Yiin-meng Lake, wave shakes Lo-yang City" (438). Here "shake" is just motion and impact, but "evaporate" indicates that the air has effected a change in the lake. In M1AN1/I9JQ "Shore wind overturns evening wave" (492), the re- sult of transference of power is expressed by "overturn." Sometimes, even when the subject or object is omitted, certain transitive verbs can still powerfully convey motion and change. WRAMMiW / TJtjiJW "Within wine-jar, (we) encounter wind and storm; in front of the window, rouses billow and wave" (496); the omitted subject of the second line is some kind of cosmic power, which makes the transitive verb tung "rouse, stir" all the more forceful. In Ff MATO. / 29R PUU45 "Wild fire cannot burn away; spring wind blows and again generates" (505), the object of sheng "generate, give birth to" is "grass," here omitted, but the regenerative power of spring still comes through. The line WV# MOR (511) may be read as "Evening mist is generated in the deep trees," but another reading is also possible: "The thick forest gives birth to evening mist." Some transitive verbs are implicitly causative. To hurry X is to cause X to be fast; to send X is to cause X to move in a certain direc- tion. In either case, the object, X, undergoes change. Thus '04 ,lr's @ "Rain sends the fragrance of wine boat" (514); Hl A-A:i* / Six 2AlT-1 "Sunny air holds lingering rain; cloudy overcast sends eve- ning thunder (412); !VAWA / Pis);$Wffi "Pure air hurries yel- low bird; sunny light turns green duck-weed" (412); A*k HB f "Cold sky hurries day short" (491). In the very last example, "day" is a pivotal noun, both the object of "hurry" and the subject of "short"; "The cold sky hurries the day and makes it short"; and this illustrates the causative implicit in the transitive "hurries." The antonyms of X "connect," W "join" are 10J "break," N. "cut off," e "divide." The former unite, the latter separate. But both types of transitive verb convey power. The following two examples are both about clouds: Wang Wei's T lRrIf "Yellow clouds break spring color" (425), and Tu Fu's PWT1Zii "Floating clouds con- nect (the States of) Hai and Tai" (465). But one pictures the clouds as an obstructive agency, and the other as a connecting agency. More- over, the concept of connection tends to veer into that of separation, and vice versa. Tu Fu's line could have been "Floating clouds sep- arate the States of Hai and Tai" and the pictorial image would remain</page><page sequence="64">112 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN the same. There is also an obvious affinity between "Yellow clouds break spring color" (425) and "Ten thousand miles of wind-mist links the pallid autumn" (587). The principle illustrated has been stated several times before: verbs of identity and connection have a built-in tendency to veer into their opposites. 3.3.6 Inversion Poetry, like any piece of consecutive writing, has a built-in forward drive. When syntactic inversion interrupts the natural flow, the ten- sion thus created heightens the sense of pulse and power. For this reason, inversion may be considered one of the dynamic features. A frequent type of inversion consists of a locative expression fol lowed by an intransitive verb and then a noun. The verb should come after the noun, but inversion moves it to the front. : 9,li;fi/ / m WMA-+ "Painted wall fly the wild geese; gauze window lodges the Cow Constellation" (420). " Ait7J( / - "Eaves fly Wan Brook's water; window drops Ching-t'ing (Mountain's) clouds" (459); the scene is a pavilion high up in the mountains; as one looks out, one can see the brook next to the eaves and the clouds below the windows. In these lines, movement is conveyed by the use of "fly" and syntactic conversion. But even if the scene described is static, the manner of description may yet convey liveliness: AA Wth / t41 .IFEI "Deserted courtyard hang orange and grapefruit; old house paints dragon and snake" (485). The meaning of this couplet is in the deserted courtyard, oranges and grapefruits hang on the trees, and on the walls of the old house, snakes and dragons are painted. Just by inverting the noun and the verb in the first line and making the verb in attributive position the main verb in the second, the poet succeeds in creating the illusion that "hang" and "paint" are activities taking place right this moment. Another frequent type of inversion verges upon the causative use of stative or intransitive verbs. The reason is that the causative sentence in Chinese is formed by moving a stative verb or an intransitive verb to the front of its noun-subject. In Chinese and in English, whether a sentence is causative or not depends upon the verb chosen. In con- sidering "to wet the towel" or "to warm the soup," we tend to feel that "wet" and "warm" are not causatives, but that they are adjectives and also transitive verbs. The sense of deviancy is stronger in "to sun</page><page sequence="65">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 113 his back" or "to ground an incompetent pilot"; we are more confident that "sun" and "ground" are basically nouns and only derivatively verbs. Confidence turns into certainty in the case of Allen Tate's "The idiot greens the meadow with his eyes." Surely "greens" is the causa- tive (or putative) use of an adjective. What this illustrates is that whether a verb should be considered a causative depends inversely upon its frequency of appearance as a transitive verb. In Recent Style poetry, the situation is even more indeterminate. The -s which marks greens as a verb has no counterpart in Chinese. In addition, there is a standing license to invert and a similar one to form causatives. Consequently, the distribution of a word in prose loses its authority as a test for deviancy, and we can rarely distinguish inver- sion from the causative with confidence. Let us review an example discussed earlier: '-MfRT- / H ! R &gt;1 "Clay melt, fly swallow; sun warm, sleep mandarin duck" (CTS, 2475). This couplet has two syntactic structures, which may be illustrated by the first line: (A) causative: "the melting of clay (announces the nest making season and) makes swallows fly," and (B) inversion: "clay melts, fly swallows" from "clay melts, swallows fly." This line could theoretically simply be in another form: (c) plain: "clay melts, swallows fly." Now, which- ever way we read the line, there is life and motion: if (A), the causative verb gestures the transference of power via its transitive position and indicates the effect via its meaning, that is, "fly"; if (B), inversion impedes the forward movement and generates dynamic tension; if (c), the implied condition-consequence form (see 3.3.2) conveys causal action. Among these, dynamism is perhaps strongest in the causative. In other words, as long as we put the individual lexical items into some sort of plausible order, we get syntax as action. There is, how- ever, another and equally important way of reading this line, as static, isolated qualities, thus: warm ("clay melt"), active ("fly"), lithe ("swallow") / warm ("sun warm"), tranquil ("sleep"), sedate ("man- darin duck"). Thus the important thing is not to determine the "real" grammatical structure, but to remember that the line has a static, qualitative aspect and a dynamic, syntactic aspect. Additional examples may now be cited: KM EW" / 1 M4Jf &amp; "Dig well, tangle palm leaf; open ditch, break bamboo root" (CTS, 2487); 3 U TA,% / ZXX 4 "Spring-day multiply fish and bird; river-sky abounding water chestnut and lotus" (CTS, 2558).</page><page sequence="66">114 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN Another type of inversion involves the interchange of subject and object. It is more complex, but the principle remains the same. 7%1 P0 6lf3; / H 3 E +i "Fountain sound gurgle precipitous rock; sun color cold blue pines" (425). The possible readings are (A) locative: eesun color is cold amidst blue pines," (B) simple inversion: "(in) the sun color, blue pines are cold," (c) causative and then subject-object interchange: "sun color chills blue pines." Isolated qualities also underlie all three readings: white and warm ("sun color"), cold ("ecold"), blue and cold ("blue pines"). The same analysis applies to 1lL2V-N&amp;NA / ATMFL'UA "Disorderly cloud low light dusk; rapid snow dance whirling wind" (CTS, 2403); M4Zit E] / g -WA "Mist-frost chill wild sun; hard rice ripe sky wind" (CTS, 2501). 3.3.7 Causative and Pivotal Constructions Fenollosa analyzed the grammatical expression of the transference of power as agent-action-object. But there is actually a fourth term in the total transaction, namely, the effect on the object. In the causative sentence, the action and the effect are both expressed by the causative verb; the action is expressed by the grammatical position of the verb whereas the effect is embodied in the semantic content of the verb, thus: 1l- J,IM* "Spring wind again greens Yangtze's southern shore." In the pivotal sentence, which has the grammatical form NVN'V' and the semantic form agent-action-object-effect, the sec- ond verb expresses the effect: ""i14 "Great voice blows earth turn" (490). The line means "Great voice blows the earth and causes it to turn"; and "earth,55 simultaneously the object of "blows" and the subject of "turns," is the pivot. In both sentence types, the verb transmits energy between the subject and the object, and effects a dynamic linkage between them. One also gets a sense that the energy passes through the object and comes out, transformed, at the other end. In the case of Wang An-shih's line "Spring wind ... ," we not only have the final product, but also a story which tells how he arrived at this choice. A literati family in Wu preserved his manuscript. At first the line reads, "again reaches Yangtze's southern shore." He circled off "reaches" with a note "no good," and changed it into "crosses." He again circled it off</page><page sequence="67">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 115 and changed it to "enters," and again to "fills." He went on like this for ten-odd words; only then did he decide upon "greens."'0 The reason for Wang's final choice can now be reconstructed. "Reaches," crosses, enters," and "fills" are transitive verbs which only express the action but not the effect. The causative "greens," on the other hand, at once embodies the act with its power and the vivid quality of its consequence. From this it is reasonable to conclude that Wang An-shih was aware of the greater power of the causative sentence. REYtRiRi / {IIRgq,q4 "Moved by the times, flowers shed tears; hating separation, birds startle heart" (470). The lines thus trans- lated apparently have "birds" and "flowers" respectively as the sub- ject of "shed tears" and "startle heart." But as early as the Sung dynasty, Ssu-ma Kuang remarked, "Flowers and birds are, in ordinary times, objects of enjoyment. (Now) one sees them and cries, hears them and becomes sad; (the condition of) the time can be discerned." This interpretation implies that it is the poet that sheds tears and becomes startled; it further suggests that chien "shed" and ching "startle" are here used as causative verbs, thus: . . . flowers cause me to shed tears; . . . birds startle my heart." While both readings are possible-and there are others-the causative interpretation does convey a special power. Earlier, in discussing the static aspect of verbs, we observe that "listen," "hear,"5 "look," "csee," "sing," "talk" emphasize visual or auditory qualities. But when a verb such as "sing" is used as a causative, there is a further effect, as the next example shows: WOE PM "Wind sings the leaves of the two shores" (438); here the meaning is "The wind makes the leaves sing." Just as "greens" com- bines transference of power and vivid color, so does "sings" embody causative action and auditory quality. The following are examples of the pivotal sentence: Uf HZ "Cold sky hurries day short" (491); the cold sun hurries the days and makes them shorter and shorter. -RMOM / iJ U S#WPRf "Gorge- clouds envelop tree small; lake sun drop boat bright" (CTS, 2451); the clouds, in the gorge, envelop trees and make them small, and the sun above the lake sets onto the boat and brightens it. "ISIJ Hung Mai t'3. , N , chiian 8, quoted in J4 t , (Peking, 1962), p. 201.</page><page sequence="68">116 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN tit "Stone's corner hook clothes break" (CTS, 2413); the stone's sharp points hook the clothes and make holes in them. 0RZEJA "Tower's snow melt (onto) city wet" (CTS, 2411). JIA#Ek* / ;$ "FPIJfi4 "Red enters peach blossoms tender; green returns (to) willow leaves young" (CTS, 2438). The pivotal construction illustrated above is the prototype of the verb + resultative complement construction of modern Chinese. E A AJMAi)2 "Stone's corner hook clothes break" would now be expressed by E fti VA4Ii, (or E3 lIA JTAhJIMT); the original line has the form N V N' V', and rearrangement into N V-V'N' makes V-V' verb and complement, whose semantic interpretation is causal action and effect. The transformation of NVNV' into NVV'N' does not always result in a grammatical sentence in modern Chinese; for example, there is no or *A")]. The deviancy is due to restrictions in lexical collocation, but the principle is in general valid. Recent Style poetry also contains a few examples of the verb-re- sultative complement construction, which was just beginning to make its appearance in T'ang Chinese. V4AlOJdWV "pine-wind blow-untie belt" (CTS, 1267); "The wind from the pines unties the belt by blowing." -) CkYT?a "Wild fire cannot eliminate (the grass) by burning" (505); here ch'uei-pu-chin is verb and potential complement. This is another way of expressing both the action and the effect. In a later section on propositional language, we will have occasion to examine another type of pivotal construction, which usually occurs in the final couplet of a poem, for example, J / EL4 S4SA17J1CIZt "Please look, on the wall, the moon in the ivy / already, by the shores of the isle, lights the blossom on the reeds" (582). The skeleton of this sentence is "look the moon lights the reeds," which has the form VN'V'N". Apart from the absence of N (the subject of "look"), which is incidental, there are two important differences be- tween this and the previous type of pivotal construction. First, here the sentence is spread out in two run-on lines. Secondly, "elook" merely emphasizes what follows but does not cause it, whereas in the previous examples V ("ehook") is the cause of V' ("ebreak"). The first type, then, conveys swiftness of action, both because the whole causal transaction is accomplished in five syllables, and because V is the direct cause of V'. The function of the second type, as we shall soon see, is primarily that of linkage and continuity.</page><page sequence="69">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 117 3.4 Personification Poets tend to be pantheists in their poetry, although their official religion may differ. For them, everything in the world partakes of the living godhead. Throughout the centuries, the Chinese world view makes shzeng "life" its root metaphor. It is, therefore, all the more natural for Chinese poets to endow every object in nature with human thoughts and feelings. This is personification. In terms of the subject- action-object scheme, personification is to treat the subject as a per- son, and the effect is to project life and motion into a poem. In Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind" ("O, wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being, . . ."), personification is achieved by the use of personal pronouns and a large assortment of similes. The poem, whose technique typifies a large bulk of English poetry, is in fact focused upon the west wind, variously personified. But in Recent Style poetry, personal pronouns are largely absent, simile is seldom used, and the organization is diffuse, not centered upon any single object. If so, nouns and pronouns cannot serve as the vehicles of personification. How is personification achieved? There is a class of adverbs often used for that purpose: 1 "by itself," N "alone," tHe "mutually," 1%, XH, " "jointly, together," S "in vain." *1RW-M TA / S44kAV [1[ "Mutually looking, neither be- ing tired / there is only the Ching-t'ing Mountain" (765). A mountain is usually a lifeless object, but here it is regarded as the poet's equal. The mountain and the poet look at each other, and neither is tired of the sight of the other. "Mh ) *X T "Bright moon come on me shine" (754); here the bright moon comes not just to shine upon the poet, but actually to pay a visit. Rlk fl1 B.&gt; / * TiatAfHP "Flying-in-the- dark fireflies by themselves shine; lodging-in-the-water birds mutually call" (483). Loneliness, a distinctively human feeling, is here attrib- uted to the fireflies by the adverb tzu "by themselves." 7JAit&amp;L?T- / @;SEC TMN "Water flows, heart does not compete; cloud exists, mind jointly tardy" (481); the poet conveys his mood of ease and content- ment by regarding the water and the cloud as his companions, marked by e"equally." Other words for togetherness are also sometimes used as coverbs or verbs. dAUJ II 9 / iI'[ LJRk "Mountain monkeys accompany (my) days and nights; river willows share (with me) the wind and mist" (415); n-3e-ik# / *A.W MPffi "A streak of cloud</page><page sequence="70">118 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN heaven equally far; eternal night, moon jointly alone"; in both these examples the poet personifies natural objects, and by so converting them into his sole companions, he emphasizes his utter loneliness. Among these words, k'ung "eempty, in vain" deserves a special word. It expresses a value judgment, the vanity of it all. In Tu Fu's poem on Chu-ko Liang's temple, there is this couplet: 55lWV n 1 E / 15MiRSM Mirrored (in) steps, blue grass by itself (grows into) spring color; separated (by) leaves, yellow oriole in vain (makes) good music" (561). Chu-ko Liang was once famous, and his temple bustled with activity. But now, the grass grows on the steps, the oriole sings his pretty solo, unheard, unseen, unremembered. The general idea expressed by tzu "eby itself" and chiu "together," etc., is analogous to that expressed by number, singular or plural. But whereas in European languages, the distinction between singular and plural applies to both nouns and verbs, tzu, chii, etc., are exclusively added to verbs. This is probably an additional reason why individua- tion and specification come through the noun into English, but through the verb in Chinese. There is a group of verbs of perception, cognition, and emotion, all distinctly human, which, when applied to plants and animals, also achieve personification. W)LtAIft "Mountain light pleases bird's nature" (448); here the bird is personified by "eplease." OIVEVEX / p A,A% t White hair mourns flower's fall; blue cloud envies bird's flight" (495); "white hair" and e'blue cloud" may be read as the con- ditions under which the poet mourns flower's fall and envies bird's flight, but it is preferable to view them as the poet's age and aspiration personified. Mf WmM / " Jt%fO VAThe hare should worry about crane's hair; the toad also longs for sable coat" (489). The topic of the poem is the moon, here represented by the hare and the toad, which, according to legend, reside in it. The hare worries about getting old, and the toad about getting cold; that is why the moon lingers in the sky. There is, therefore, double personification: the hare and the toad directly, and the moon indirectly. WI pa "River (is) blue flower will burst into flame" (766); here yii has the primary meaning of eewant, will, desire." lAIMrJW / " tSpring wind knows parting is sad / does not send green (color) to willow twigs" (766). This couplet, unlike the previous examples, occurs at the end of the poem. In it, the poet's personal voice speaks through what the spring wind knows.</page><page sequence="71">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 119 3.5 Summary When critics talk about syntax as action, they probably have two things in mind. There is, first of all, the sweep and turn of articulate energy as exemplified in the intricate involution in Shakespeare's sonnets or the periodic decision in Milton's blank verse. For this kind of effect, it does not matter much what the lines say, as long as the sentence has enough room for the formation and resolution of rhyth- mic tensions. In this section, our main focus is not on that aspect of dynamic syntax. The most spacious sentence in Recent Style poetry is made up of two septasyllabic lines in enjambment. But this type of sentence usually occurs in the final, propositional part of a poem, and will be discussed in the next section. At the same time it may be noted that the sense of action conveyed by the sweep and turn of syntax is sub- jective; it is homomorphic to other types of rhythmic or semirhythmic movement-in music, in dance, and in sport-and ultimately rests upon the makeup of our psyche. What has been discussed under novel usage (3.3.1) and inversion (3.3.6) operates on the same sub- jective principle, and that is the extent to which our discussion has something in common with this subjective conception of dynamic syntax. The second view of syntax as action is exemplified by Fenollosa's objective and mimetic theory. The transitive sentence best expresses the transference of power in nature because it mirrors the order of transaction in the objective world: the agent comes first, from which the action flows to the object. We find Fenollosa's view congenial on two counts. First, the word order in Chinese is by and large the same as that in English, so that the mimetic sequence has a natural counterpart in Chinese. Fenollosa was aware of this, since his theory is about the transitive sentence both in English and in Chinese. Secondly, Fenollosa's theory has the virtue of being applicable to the shortest and simplest sentence, as his prime example shows, and this fits very well with the characteristic terseness of the line in Recent Style poetry. Nevertheless, we have made some revisions. Fenollosa's conception of action is probably that of mechanical causation; in any case, his prime example "efarmer pound rice" conveys this impression. But the</page><page sequence="72">120 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN root metaphor in the Chinese world view is "life," and this necessi- tates a greater emphasis on those verbs and adverbs which denote or connote life and sentience. We have also extended Fenollosa's three- term analysis (agent-act-object) to four to accommodate the causative sentence and the pivotal sentence. Several of our examples are adapted from the traditional i4 E shih- hua "talks on poetry." V shih-yen is a term which occurs with great frequency in these talks. It means "the eye of a poem." Just as the eye is the focus of the face, so the poem's eye is the spark, the life, in a poem. A survey of these "talks on poetry" shows that when earlier writers discuss "the eye of a poem," they are mainly discussing verbs: which verb is more appropriate, and which position should the verb occupy in the line. The authors of these "talks" will probably agree with us when we say that the verbal excellence in poetry mainly rests in the excellent use of verbs. 4. THE PROPOSITION AND UNIFYING SYNTAX 4.1 Introduction Tu Fu's "Yangtze and Han" ends with these lines: t i / _1_0 R "Sinee antiquity keep old horse, (which) need not take the long road." This example exhibits several noteworthy features- noteworthy, because the general characteristics they illustrate are also found in a vast majority of ending couplets: two lines in enjambment creating a continuous rhythm, the assertive force marked by pu Pi eeneed not," and the backward projection of time via the phrase eesince antiquity." Our aim in this section is to describe this type of ending couplet in terms of its syntactic structure and its poetic effect, and we shall begin by setting forth the differences between a image and a proposition, or equivalently, the differences between imagistic language and propositional language. In the imagistic part of a poem, dream and fantasy merge into reality and the question of truth and falsity simply does not arise. "Willing suspension of disbelief" in this context does not mean to believe the poet, since to instill belief is not his purpose. An image has the schematic form "it is so and so," or even better, "[it is] so and so" with "it is" suspended in brackets. In other words, the function of an image is to evoke a mental picture or to recall a physical sensation. It presents but does not assert. It appeals to our imagination but by-</page><page sequence="73">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 121 passes our understanding. By this criterion, lines made up of nouns in juxtaposition are imagistic ("Ccockcrow, straw hut, moon; footprints, plank bridge, frost"); so is a simple declarative sentence serving as the vehicle of a dynamic image ("eevening mist forms in the dense trees"). A proposition, in our usage, is that which appeals primarily to the understanding. It has the schematic form "I know it is so and so" or "I assert it is so and so." It makes a truth claim and precipitates a fissure between the real and the imagery. A simple declarative sen- tence, depending upon the intensity of its sensuous content, may be either an image or a proposition. But a sentence containing a logical phrase such as pu pi "cneed not" must be classified as a proposition. The moon and the cloud, the sky and the night, belong to nature, but negation and necessity belong to the realm of concepts. By the same token, sentences in the subjunctive, interrogative, or imperative mood are propositional. Their descriptive content, that is, what they have in common with a corresponding declarative sentence ("eThe book is red."), may be imagined; but what they have in addition-traditional- ly, their mood ("eIs the book red?", "CIf the book is red . .")-can only be apprehended by thought. It is often said that a poem is overheard but not heard. This dictum applies to Recent Style poetry, but strictly speaking, only to its imagistic part. When our suspension of disbelief is complete, when we are fully absorbed in the imagery presented before us, we partake of the poet's point of view and indeed become one with him. But to use a term such as pu pi "cneed not" is to assert, to speak with the poet's own voice, and in so doing, the poet reveals himself. The poet steps forth even more when he uses "I" to refer to himself or "you" to address the reader, or when he injects an explicit subjective comment. The audience, instead of overhearing, is addressed directly. The poet as subject, then, is another characteristic of propositional language. Imagery, especially the simple kind examined above, is in the mode of presentational immediacy. It matters little whether we designate its temporal mode as the eternal present or timeless time. The important thing is that the entire scene can be seen in a flash. If we want to call that kind of time the present, then we should remember that it is a present which knows no past or future. When we earlier used "cabso- lute time" to characterize the simple image, we used the term ad- visedly; the time is absolute because there is no other.</page><page sequence="74">122 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN In contrast, the temporal mode of a proposition is relative; the present is contrasted either with the past or the future. "Since an- tiquity" is one way to bring about this contrast. Historical allusion is another. In what follows we will also see ending couplets which look forward to the future. Throughout our previous discussion, we have emphasized the frag- mentary character of Recent Style poetry, that is, the earlier, imagistic part of a poem. In addition to the several varieties of isolating syntax, we also mentioned the fact that a line constitutes a unit by itself, and that the couplet form has the effect of impeding the natural flow. On the other hand, the proposition, which occurs at the end of a poem, is an agent of continuity. "Since antiquity keep old horse / no need to take the long road" is a pivotal sentence made up of two lines, in which continuity is transmitted through Told horse"-the object of the first line and the subject of the second. Other ending couplets have the first line serving as the subject and the second line as the predi- cate. Question and answer is another form. Their common denomi- nator is the sweep and momentum that carries the penultimate line into the ultimate line. The differences between the imagistic middle couplet and the propositional final couplet may be summarized as follows: Middle Couplet Final Couplet discontinuity, juxtaposition continuity, syntactic unity sensory response, imagination intellectual response, understanding declarative mood other moods absolute space-time relative space-time impersonal poet as subject 4.2 Continuity and Syntactic Unity "Since antiquity keep old horse / need not take the long road" is a case of enjambment, in particular a pivotal sentence with the subject of the second line stated in the first. The following ending couplets similarly illustrate the placement of subject and predicate in separate lines: fiMM1&amp;ft / *Xf;H1J "Sad is the former Shu dancer / (who) comes to dance before the Wei palace" (504); i 3 ; / . P f 1VMII)g "Wild crows take no heed / flutter and cry, bustle among themselves" (489).</page><page sequence="75">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 123 The pivotal sentence is often formed by the use of the copula shih. VAI &amp;*gi / F g8 e fl3 "I am thejade Emperor's incense table attendant / (who) living in exile still gets to reside at P'eng-lai" (615). J'I'ZR Aill / *;W94 lI1k "Pity the bones by the Wu-ting River, (which) are still the men in boudoir dreams" (838). A few expressions, instrumental in forming run-on lines, occur frequently in ending couplets. As such they may be regarded as formulae. (1) "To pity," 'cto love": N'kLAHTJ /T- / 15J1q* ib "W9, 4T "Pity (the Emperor) who at midnight kept the seat facing him empty / (and then) instead of asking about the people, asked about the gods" (836). WNl* A1&amp;W4T- / M4 0_ kTi$X1e "Pity the im- mortal on top of the Hou Mountain / (who) by himself, still plays the reed pipes, drunk among azure peaches" (62o). 4Iff' LAJI -`JA / {RUJ {41lP7 "Pity the third night of the ninth month / dew is like pearls, and the moon like a bow" (824); FJ 6A RftA0_ / -t' 1 tF&amp; T"Look back and pity the singing, dancing land / Ch'in from ancient times was the seat of princes" (587); MRiM*j%TT / -i??PiJIIN1 t9 (I) love most, to the east of the Lake, (whose beau- ty) my strolling can never exhaust / the White Sand Dam in the shade of green willows" (613). (2) "Please look": UM-i) / -EJki dt T"Please look! On the wall, the moon in the ivy / Already, by the shores of the isle, lights the blossom on the reeds" (582); J / AV Wg+I' "When you reach the yonder shore, please look back / the P'eng-lai Palace in the middle of the sea" (613); a r1AW7JZ?E / b;KOkif?P CcYou, sir, go and try to look above the Feng River / (to see whether) the white clouds are still like (those of) Han time's autumn" (807). (3) "Heard it said": rFl MtJV PMbA / NOV ) N cc (I) heard it said that (you) will come to pay a visit / Looking at the moon from the west tower, (I count) the number of times it will have to be full" (601); rgl / Zd&amp; ?lUtIi cc(J) heard it said that pretty sights have filled the Yangtze / On a fair day, (let us) go up the tower and look homeward together" (814); l LAA{UTI Wf / WI-ff4 f:T'JA,#S ccI heard it said that Ch'ang-an looks like a chessboard: a hundred years of the saddest events" (584). These pivotal sentences or run-on lines are all instances of unifying syntax. By their sweep and drive, they impart a sense of continuity,</page><page sequence="76">124 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN otherwise lacking, to the poem. Let us also note that in almost all the examples above, the personal voice of the poet can be clearly dis- cerned. In lines such as "Look back and pity the singing, dancing land," the poet steps forth to make an explicit comment. When "please look" is used, the audience, instead of overhearing, is ad- dressed directly. "Heard it said" implies that the poet was the ad- dressee. Other devices such as the use of "I" to refer to the poet himself and "you, sir" to refer to the audience have the similar effect of injecting a personal, subjective note at the end of the poem. 4.3 Nondeclarative Sentences Sentences in the interrogative, subjunctive, or imperative mood are nondeclarative. Their descriptive content, that is, what they have in common with the corresponding declarative sentence may be imag- ined; but what they have in addition-traditionally, their mood-can only be apprehended by thought. When a nondeclarative sentence occurs at the end of a Recent Style poem, it has the effect of winging the poem beyond the physical confine of its four or eight lines. In the last section, we have already seen instances of the nondeclarative sentence: lines beginning with "please look," for example, are in the imperative mood. Various other types of nondeclarative sentence now follow. Question and answer: KLM4&gt;F_W / iff_fAOkW "Why not return home? Above the Huai River is the autumn hill" (497); AP51;H*A fIf El / J-llF;lWSUP1 "In this day of war and strife, when shall we meet again? (When) the spring wind returns to Chung-hsiuan Tower" (570). If-then construction: ;AT* A- / "i,R- 4 PJIf one meets, there underground, the last Ch'en Emperor / Should one inquire after the Song of Courtyard Flowers?" (622). Contrary to fact conditional: * iTAL JrY tF / flitW4iIi "Had the east wind not come to General Chou's aid / Bronze-Sparrow Palace, in the deep spring, would have sealed both Ch'iao girls" (829); tFi10E 'R I t E / TiWiA11W;ItI&amp; [l[ bIf only the Winged General were still guarding the Dragon City / (he) would not have allowed the Tartar horsemen to cross the Yin Mountain" (793). Premise and conclusion: tt+ Po uTh / " 1IJ 2,iIZ tThe passing of the past and the coming of the present are no more than this / (In seeing) Ox Hill, why should</page><page sequence="77">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 125 one alone wet his clothes (with tears)?" (618). The hypothetical and the interrogative combined: &amp;MA ;UTH 1I / -2 T_t i "Should friends and relatives of Lo-yang ask about me / (Answer,) a flake of icy heart in a jade vase" (795). 4.4 Relative Time The ending couplet often introduces relative time into the poem. The use of "since antiquity" accomplishes that purpose in "Yangtze and Han," and this expression also occurs in another poem by Tu Fu: "Look back and pity the singing, dancing land / Ch'in since antiquity was the seat of princes" (587). Moreover, most of the examples of continuous syntax also illustrate relative time in its several varieties. In "Pity the bones by the Wu-ting River, which are still the men of boudoir dreams," the soldiers' death is an event in the past, although their loved ones are even now under an illusion. In "Sad is the former Shu dancing girl / (who) comes to dance before the Wei Palace," the contrast is between a more remote past (Shu) and a more recent past (Wei). Other ending couplets look forward to the future from the present perspective: "If friends and relatives in Lo-yang should ask about me . . ." or "I heard that you plan to come to pay a visit / Looking out from the west tower, I count the number of times the moon will have to full (before you come)." All these examples con- trast an earlier time against a later time, and hence illustrate the con- cept of relative time. In this section, we will present a few more examples. The contrast between past and present is often focused upon a per- son or a natural object, which remains constant amidst change. Three of Liu Yii-hsi's quatrains end this way. ER7J M-Ai*AWfl / }i_T ikA"* "To the east of the Huai River, the moon of former times / still passes, when night is deep, over the parapet" (8i8). 1iE 0i?j t / M A v9-41 "The swallows before the halls of Wang and Hsieh in former times / fly into the homes of ordinary folks" (819). (Wang and Hsieh refer to two great families of the Six Dy- nasties, the epoch before T'ang.) KA 4I4&amp;T WrE / W A&amp;AP7E8 M "Among former acquaintances only Ho K'an remains / (who) more than ever does his best in singing the (farewell) Song of Wei City" (818). The same technique is employed with a slight variation in Han Chuang's quatrain (840):</page><page sequence="78">126 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN I ir 0- / *A,Aa ft OMEAIkW / MN+M4 River rain drizzle, drizzle; river grass (grows) in pace, Six Dynasties are like a dream, birds cry in vain. Most heartless are the willows of T'ai City, As in former times, mistlike, enfolding ten miles of dike. What we have called contrary to fact conditional may also be called revisionist history. It is the attempt on the part of the poet to imagine a different course for past events; and as such, lines of this type imply a contrast with the past: 4*Rfl)J~'IS / gZA9 RtWsM! / ~jTh Bright moon of Ch'in times, and the pass of Han, (Away on) a ten thousand mile expedition, the soldiers have not returned. If only the Winged General were still at Dragon City, He would not have let Tartar horsemen pass Mt. Yin. (793) The first line juxtaposes the moon and the pass against each other and against the backdrop of history. This technique recalls the line ". and see whether the white clouds are like those of Han time's au- tumn" (807). The ending couplet is a case of contrary to fact condi- tional. "Winged General" refers to Li Kuang, the famous Han con- queror of the Hsiung-nu. The poet thinks back to the general, brings him back to life, and projects this altered past as a hope for the present. A similar type of ending occurs in Tu Mu's "Red Cliff," although the strategy is more subtle. Z$$*th ~/ n1X7wa-AN-411JOI AM,6&gt;XAJAD / fl!4 M A broken halberd, sunk in the sand, its iron unrotted still, I polished it, and made it out to be the remains of an earlier dynasty. Had the east wind not come to General Chou's aid, Spring advanced in Bronze-Sparrow Palace, both Ch'iao girls incarcerated. (829)</page><page sequence="79">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 127 The last two lines encapsule quite a complicated line of historical speculation. Had the east wind not come at the right moment, Chou Yiu and Chu-ko Liang would have lost the Battle of Red Cliff. As a consequence, the two Ch'iao girls-the wives of Chou Yiu and his master-would have been captured by Ts'ao Ts'ao and kept at his Bronze-Sparrow Palace. But of course revisionist history is mere fantasy. What has happened has happened, once for all. And even if history could be altered, the major difference it would make, accord- ing to the poet, is to cause two pretty girls to change hands. The conqueror and the vanquished, whoever they were or might have been, had all returned to dust. The only relic was a broken halberd, whose master was beyond recall. So with this frivolous fiddling, the poet reduces history to farce, mere material for poetic play. *i% %rT0 /TA V=f RWV'1AE /Ti#4MT2 (Above) the Blue Sea long clouds darken Snow Mountain, Solitary city looks afar to Jade Gate Pass. Yellow sand (after) a hundred battles pierces golden armor, Unless Kroraimna is taken (we) shall not return. (792) This poem illustrates several features discussed earlier. The first two lines contain three place names, each of which conveys a distinct quality via its color word. In line 1, "Blue Sea" and "long cloud" are juxtaposed, although when translated into English, we may read it as "above the Blue Sea, the long clouds. . . ." Isolative syntax takes another form in line 3, where "hundred battles" interrupts the for- ward flow, and "yellow sand," thus liberated from syntactic con- straint, assumes the role of a simple image. The first two lines are set in the eternal present, or absolute time. In contrast, "hundred bat- tles" projects line 3 backwards into the past, and line 4, a vow in the hypothetical mood, looks forward to the future. g T C 'W / 'm \;".ia ft &gt;AITIfi:T / P)]) Millf-RA;M Dusk clouds all retrieved, pure chill spills, Silvery Milky Way not a whisper, turns the jade bowl. This life this night does not long remain well, Bright moon next year where shall (I) see? (845)</page><page sequence="80">128 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN This poem, although written in the Sung dynasty by Su Shih, is in the T'ang style. The first two lines constitute the imagistic part. "Jade bowl" and "pure chill" are respectively the conventional terms for the moon and moonlight. The four simple images-"dusk cloud," "pure chill," "silver Milky Way," jade bowl"-are all oriented toward the qualities cold and white. The two verbs "spill" and "turn" convey an unobtrusive sense of dynailic action. The temporal framework is that of absolute time. In contrast, the last two lines hardly contain any imagery. They appeal to our understanding, not our imagination. The final couplet contrasts tonight and next year, thus introducing relative time. The appearance of "this life," "this night," and "next year" also brings the poet to the fore; "this night" and "next year" are what Bertrand Russell has called "egocentric words," whose designation depends upon the here-and-now of I, the speaker. The "ebright moon" of line 4 recapitulates lines 1 and 2; and as the continuous rhythm of the ending couplet sweeps up the "bright moon", it brings the moon into relation with the poet's transient condition and propels the poem, airborne on the wings of its final question, into what lies beyond. 5. THE LANGUAGES OF T'ANG POETRY So far we have been comparing imagistic language and propositional language point by point: discontinuous versus continuous, objective versus egocentric, sensory awareness versus intellectual understand- ing, absolute space- time versus relative space-time. But is there a central thread that runs through these discrete differences? Is it pos- sible to so characterize the two languages that they represent two modes of experiencing? In this section we shall attempt to answer these questions in terms of a theory inspired by Cassirer. Imagistic language is undifferentiated. Propositional language is differentiated. This is their basic distinction, out of which flows all the other differences. Willing suspension of disbelief is the prerequisite attitude for the imagistic part of a poem, in which the imaginary is the real, and the distinction between truth and falsehood simply does not exist. That part of the poem is overheard but not heard because the poet is the audience. The Ego and the World remain in their primordial state of union, and the child has yet to progress into the 1-thou relation. For</page><page sequence="81">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 129 the mystic, the psychotic, the primitive, the child, and the child in the poet, the present is all of time; it is the only moment capable of being endowed with pleasure, beatitude, and imagery, in as concentrated and as pure a form as possible. To think of the world as things re- quires experience, the long view, the abandonment of the present: the moon is still there even as it disappears beyond the horizon, and it is the very same moon whether it appears crescent-shaped, disc-shaped, or assumes another guise. But to the infant, the moon is just a grasp- able thing at the end of his fingers, and to the poet, it is the trans- lucency, the whiteness, and the coldness that matter; in the attitude of rapt absorption, of ecstatic urgency, things dissolve into qualities. In that same attitude, each thing or each sensation monopolizes the attention at each moment; or as Kierkegaard has put it, "purity of heart is to want one thing." In poetry, this attitude manifests itself as discontinuous rhythm, juxtaposed images, and isolative syntax. The imagistic language embodies the voice of innocence, the once born, the child in every one of us even wben we are afraid to recognize him. But that infantile paradise presided over by identity cannot last forever. The world splits off from the self, and the Ego from the ld. But the perpetual child in the poet stubbornly holds onto that ever- perishing oneness; Humpty-Dumpty falls from the wall, and the child-poet becomes all the king's soldiers and all the king's men. As Roman Jakobson has pointed out, poetry is pervaded by equivalence: "The poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination.""1; and making things equivalent is the attempt to restore the primordial oneness after the fall. For ordinary language to convey information, it must have suffi- cient differentiation and opposition. In poetry, a single linguistic feature is seized upon and, for the time being, made the ruling princi- ple of equivalence. Thus rhyme and meter are the equivalence of sound and stress; parallelism is the equivalence of grammatical struc- ture; word category in traditional Chinese poetics is one kind of equivalence of meaning; metaphor is another (for example, the boat is the plough and the sea is the field; hence "the boat ploughs the sea"). Equivalence is one key concept to be discussed in a subsequent study tentatively entitled "Metaphor and Allusion." 11 Roman Jakobson, "Linguistics and Poetics," in Thomas Sebeok, ed., Style in Langzuage (Cambridge, Mass., 1960), p. 358.</page><page sequence="82">130 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN But equivalence is but one avenue along which poetry may proceed. If poetry does no more, it can only be considered a case of infantile regression and does not merit being called the mirror of life-a life to be seen steady and true. Differentiation is inevitable. To reunify what has undergone differentiation is one of the functions of syntax, espe- cially the kind of syntax characteristic of propositional language; and in performing this function, syntax becomes an instrument of dis- cursive articulation. To be discursive is to forego the intensive for the extensive; it is to treat the immediate content only as a point of departure, and not as the focus of rapt attention. To articulate is to spell out the parts as parts, and then indicate, explicitly, their inter- relationship. If the pleasure principle governs imagistic language, then the reality principle governs propositional language-a language that speaks the voice of experience, the twice born, the man who has gone through trial and tribulation. Discursive articulation as a mode of discourse can never achieve concentration and intensity. For critics like Ezra Pound and Herbert Read who take the German word Dichtung literally to mean condensa- tion and concentration, propositional language is prose, not poetry. As part of a manifesto, this view may have some merit; it certainly had its share of influence in modern poetry. But the truth of the matter is that propositional language has always played an important role in English poetry. In Recent Style poetry, the ending couplet is almost invariably couched in propositional language. Because its underlying principle is discursive articulation, proposi- tional language when occurring at the end of a Recent Style poem is accompanied by a dilution of sensuous content. What it gains, how- ever, is knowledge and understanding. Let us return to the very last poem discussed. To be absorbed in the chilly translucency is to be under the spell of imagistic language. But to know that the moon will be there next year though I may not is to understand the significance, the relation, of the moon with respect to me. To indicate time, place, and person-as that poem does in its last couplet-is a case of dis- cursive articulation; so is the introduction of relative, sequential time. To spell out the parts as parts and then relate them requires a sufficiently copious vehicle. Thus propositional language often takes the specific form of lines in enjambment, either ten or fourteen sylla- bles in all. Continuous rhythm is in part a by-product, and in part an</page><page sequence="83">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 131 instrument of unification. The split between the Ego and the World is a traumatic experience that cries out for solace. The ending couplet (as in Su Shih's poem on the moon) mediates a union through its use of propositional language. The result is that the poet not only sees the world, but sees himself, self-consciously, in the world; and this ego- centric turn, when compared with the purely objective mode of the imagistic part, gives the ending couplet a poignant personal tone. Imagistic language, by its oneness and intensity, tends to be frag- mentary and discontinuous. Propositional language is the polar op- posite; it aims for wholeness and integration. There is however an intermediate stage. The transitive sentence, which in Fenollosa's view mirrors the transference of power in nature, is one way in which two nouns, otherwise disjunct, are connected. The verbs "to be," "to be like," "to appear," "to connect," "to break" are other ways to con- nect two nouns. Because of the basic polarity in the differentiated and undifferentiated mode of experiencing, and because of the centripetal drive inherent in nouns qua nouns, any static relation between two nouns is always in a precarious state of equilibrium. That all these verbs tend to veer into their opposite is symptomatic of the tensioned union. The primordial oneness of imagistic language should be distin- guished from the reunification achieved through propositional lan- guage. "Floating cloud, wandering son's mind" is one type of equiva- lence, an equivalence achieved through texture in which the images remain strong and independent. But to say "floating cloud is like wandering son's mind" is to articulate discursively; it is to spell out the parts as parts and to indicate the relation between them, in this case, that of similarity. That the copula and simile-making verbs "is like," "seems"-the most conceptual of all verbs-occur only in the ending couplet is another indication of the division of labor between imagistic language and propositional language in Recent Style poetry. Much of what we have just said was anticipated, in principle at least, by Ernst Cassirer in his Language and Myth. There is, however, a difference. In that book Cassirer was primarily concerned with myth, which, together with language and art, constitutes the major symbolic forms; indeed they are derived from the same root. From Plato on, the intimate connection between myth-making and poetry-making is gen- erally accepted. Thus, in the following quotation, merely substitute</page><page sequence="84">132 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN "propositional language" and "imagistic language" for "conceptual thinking" and "mythical thinking" respectively, and the meaning of that passage and its relevance to the present discussion will be clear. The aim of theoretical thinking, as we have seen, is primarily to deliver the contents of sensory or intuitive experience from the isolation in which they originally occur. It causes these contents to transcend their narrow limits, combines them with others, compares them, and concatenates them in a definite order, in an all-inclusive context. It proceeds "ediscursively," in that it treats the immediate content only as a point of departure, from which it can run the whole gamut of impressions in various directions, until these impressions are fitted together into one unified conception, one closed system. In this system there are no more isolated points; all its members are reciprocally related, refer to one another, illumine and explain each other. Thus every separate event is ensnared, as it were, by invisible threads of thought, that bind it to the whole. The theoretical significance which it receives lies in the fact that it is stamped with the character of this totality. Mythical thinking, when viewed in its most elementary forms, bears no such stamp; in fact, the character of intellectual unity is directly hostile to its spirit. For in this mode, thought does not dispose freely over the data of intuition, in order to relate and compare them to each other, but is captivated and enthralled by the intuition which suddenly confronts it. It comes to rest in the immediate experience; the sensible present is so great that everything else dwindles before it. For a person whose apprehension is under the spell of this mythico-religious attitude, it is as though the whole world were simply annihilated; the immediate content, whatever it be, that commands his religious interest so completely fills his conscious- ness that nothing else can exist beside and apart from it. The ego is spend- ing all its energy on this single object, lives in it, loses itself in it. Instead of a widening of intuitive experience, we find here its extreme limitation; instead of expansion that would lead through greater and greater spheres of being, we have here an impulse toward concentration; instead of extensive distribution, intensive compression. This focusing of all forces on a single point is the prerequisite for all mythical thinking and mythical formula- tion. (Language and Myth, pp. 32-33) We are now ready to return to the question which initiated this inquiry: What is the function of syntax in poetry? In Donald Davie's Articulate Energy three answers were given: T. E. Hulme, syntax as unpoetic; Ernest Fenollosa, syntax as action; Susanne Langer, syntax as music. Donald Davie's own view holds that syntax in poetry is an instrument of discursive articulation, and it is not very much different from syntax in prose (see esp. Chaps. 13 and 14).</page><page sequence="85">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 133 As we view this controversy from our present vantage point, we cannot but recall the blind men arguing about the elephant. This observation is of course unjust. In the first place, all except Langer are either advocates or detractors of symbolist or postsymbolist poetry, and their statements are programmatic in intent. The question they are concerned with is actually, "What should be the function of syntax in poetry?" or "What should modern poetry be and what kind of syntax is appropriate to it?" Secondly, they are mostly arguing about poetry written in English. English is considerably more copious and discursive than Chinese, at least in poetic language. Consequent- ly, things that can be done quite naturally in Chinese (such as isola- tion of noun-images by syntax) may seem artificial or impossible in English, and vice versa. Having made these qualifications, we are still left with the question: What is the function of syntax in Recent Style poetry? We ap- proached the question from two directions. On the one hand, we asked this question with respect to the noun, the verb, and the sentence. That is, we pluralized syntax into its major components. Of course, even when the question has been divided up, the answer cannot be given simply. Thus in discussing noun-images we had to take isolative syntax into consideration, and in our exploration of verbs, we took a detour into the semantics of individual verbs, and so on. On the other hand, the three spokesmen had three different views of the function of syntax: image making, mimetic action, and discursive articulation. We accepted their views on faith, and found instances in Recent Style poetry which respectively illustrate these views. Whichever way we turn, we find the pluralistic view the most plausible. In different parts of a Recent Style poem, there are different kinds of syntax, which serve different types of poetic function. In particular, the contrast between imagistic language and propositional language is basic, and we attempt to characterize these two languages and to connect them with two distinctive modes of thought. For these reasons, this paper should perhaps be titled "The Languages of T'ang Poetry."</page><page sequence="86">134 KAO YU-KUNG AND MEI TSU-LIN FINDING LIST TSSCY* CTS S Poet's Name TSSCY CTS Poet's Name 5-character 8-line Poems 412-1 734 Tu Shen-yen 456 1731 4;tf i=w t N 457-2 1804 412-2 735 458 1805 413 1035 Shen Ch'iuan-ch'i 459-1 1839 jt fluj 459-2 1840 415-2 657 Sung Chih-wen 462-2 1849 5.;t roi 1768 418-2 1146 Ho Chih-chang 465 2393 Tu Fu 420-2 1192 Sun Ti 469 2403 3ffi At470 2404 422-1 1266 Wang Wei 477 2419 Tim 479 2421 422-2 1276 480-1 2434 425-1 1274 480-2 2439 425-2 1271 481 2440 430 1272 483-1 2459 432 1279 483-2 2465 433 1278 485-2 2489 435 1279 486 2489 1267 487 2523 1278 489-1 2551 438-1 1633 Meng Haojan 489-2 2532 490 2443 438-2 1635 491-1 2565 440-1 1644 492 2566 440-2 1645 2397 445-1 1626 2403 445-2 2870 Liu Shen-hsiu 2411 V I 1,14 i 2413 448 1461 Ch'ang Chien 2438 TA 2451 454 1702 Li Po 2455 2486 455-1 1702 2494 * Kao Pu-ying, Anthology of T'ang and Sung Poetry (Peking, 1959). t Complete T'ang Poems (Peking, 1960).</page><page sequence="87">SYNTAX, DICTION, AND IMAGERY IN T'ANG POETRY 135 TSSCY CTS Poet's Name TSSCY CTS Poet's Name 2501 504 4016 Liu Yii-hsi 2527 % J^ X 2558 505 4836 Po Chiu-i 495-1 2964 Ts'en Shen bJ 511 5964 Tu Mu 495-2 2071 t t 496 2078 514-2 6213 Li Shang-yin 497 1898 Wei Ying-wu aj0ja : v- IS.
