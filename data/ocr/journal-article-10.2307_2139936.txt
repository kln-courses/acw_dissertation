<plain_text><page sequence="1">POLLOCK AND MAITLAND'S HISTORY OF ENGLISH LAW.1 OUR knowledge of the development of English law in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries has been so enlarged in modern times, by important publications of material and by special investigations, that a comprehensive presentation has come to be not merely a prom- ising task but an urgent need. Reeves's History of the English Law, which in the first volume of the latest edition deals with the period down to Edward I, must be described to-day as antiquated. Published a century ago, it was for the time an exceedingly meritorious work; but Finlason's attempt to modernize it was a lamentable failure, and his alterations and additions, as I think I demonstrated 2 in I873, marked no advance but rather a deplorable step backward. There is the more reason for welcoming a work in which two legal historians, who long ago gave notable proofs of capacity, have at once brought the history of English law, for the period from I I54 to I272, up to the full height of modern scientific research. With a style that is always dignified and often captivating, it has what I regard as the highest excellence in legal-historical writing: it is thought out, all through, in an emi- nently realistic spirit. Its importance consists not merely in its direct promotion of the knowledge of English legal development, but also in the fructifying influence which it may be expected to exercise upon the history of other Germanic legal systems. From the older school of English legal historians, who treated the English law as a thing by itself, completely isolated from the rest of the world, and who recognized its derivation from the common law of the Germanic races only incidentally- usually by an occa- sional citation from Tacitus, - Pollock and Maitland distinguish themselves by bringing into English legal history the full stream of scientific results attained by Germanistic research during the past three decades. The German literature has been extensively con- 1 The History of English Law before the Time of Edward I.

Considerable use is made of concep- tions peculiar to German law. German legal expressions, such as " thinglike " and " thinglikeness " (dinglich, Dinglichkeit), are intro- duced into English legal speech. Constant attention is paid to the Norman law and its sources, although, in my judgment, the influence which it has exercised upon the development of the English law should have been more strongly emphasized. The proportion in which each of the two authors has contributed to the common work is not indicated in the book itself, although a prefatory note by Pollock declares that the execution of the plan drawn up in common has devolved for the most part upon Maitland. Earlier investigations by Pollock and by Maitland afford sufficient data for determining with some degree of precision the authorship of portions of the work; but since the authors themselves do not desire that any distinction should be drawn between their separate contri- butions, the reviewer is not entitled to express any conjectures upon this matter, but is bound to treat the work of the two autbors as their intellectual property " zu gesammter Hand," as the German law has it, or, to use an English phrase, as a sort of " tenancy by entireties." As the title of the work indicates, the history of the English law is to be treated only down to the accession of Edward I, the English Justinian. This limit of time, however, is not rigidly observed: the description of many legal institutions starts, for the sake of obtaining a convenient point of departure, with the form which they have assumed in the common law. In some cases, too, the development is traced back to the ancient Germanic beginnings. The authors divide their material into two books. The first book, a " Sketch of Early English Legal History," corresponds to what German writers call "general" or "external " legal history. The second book, " The Doctrines of English Law in the Early Middle Ages," is devoted to the institutions of private and of criminal law and of the law of procedure. Constitutional history proper is ex- cluded. The authors originally intended to add a third book, which was to contain studies on Domesday Book. This plan they aban- doned -and rightly, for these studies would have fitted ill in the frame of the published work, which deals most fully with the legal development from Henry II to Edward I. As it is quite impossible even to summarize the rich contents of The History of English Law, I must confine myself here, at the risk of seeming a captious critic, to singling out a few matters which</page><page sequence="3">536 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. XI. give occasion either for indicating a different point of view on my own part or for corrections or additions. The first book begins with a general view of Anglo-Saxon legal conditions. Although these ought to be depicted only with reference to the Anglo-Norman period, the whole section is still a little too scanty, and is not on a level with the other chapters of this excellent work. Precisely in view of the later development, mention might have been made of the power of mitigating (lfhting) the strict law which, according to Edgar, iii, 2, pertained to the Anglo-Saxon king. For the Dane/ag no use appears to have been made of Steenstrup's Normannerne. The general extension of the system of compositions, which is shown by LElfred, Introduction, 49, ? 7, is not considered. The Burgundian king mentioned on pages i6 and 28 of the first vol- ume was not named Gundobald, but Gundobad. The historic position of the gesibas is not made quite clear, because the transplantation of this oldest class of Anglo-Saxon retainers from the lord's house and their transformation into a hereditary estate of privileged landholders are overlooked. The same development occurred afterward in the case of the thanes, who originally held office in the household of the lord. There is a misconception of Cnut, ii, 22, when this passage is cited to sustain the statement that " a defendant who was of evil repute might be driven to clear himself by the fore-oath alone " (vol. i, p. i6). The fore-oath drove the homo credibilis to clear himself, and this he did by simple oath of purgation. The homo incredibi/is, the man of evil repute, had to swear a threefold oath or accept the ordeal. The Anglo-Saxon slavery for crime cannot be regarded as a payment of composition by service, as the " working out of a debt." In Chapter III, " England under the Norman Kings," the narra- tive reaches firmer ground. The development of the legal language and the relative influence exerted upon it by the Anglo-Saxon and the French are vividly and attractively described. The striking fact is made clear that the Anglo-Saxon legal terms continued to exist only in the case of antiquated institutions, while the new and living law appeared in French garb. The illustrations given by the authors may perhaps be supplemented by instancing the rules regarding the iuramentum frac/um and pianum (nonfrac/um). That the distinction was known to the Norman law, is proved by the Concilium Li/lebon- nense of io8o. What the authors say on page 68 of the first volume about the iuramen/um frac/um is partly corrected by note x on page 599 of the second volume, where it is indicated as possible that the oath in question was one "broken into clauses," i.e. dictated</page><page sequence="4">No- 3-. THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LA W. 537 clause by clause. To me there is no question about the matter: a comparison of the old French sources leaves no room for doubt. When it is said in William, ii, 3 (cf. iii, I 2), that the Frenchman is to defend himself against the Englishman with an unbroken oath (mid unforedan dte), this implies, in my judgment, that at that time the Anglo-Saxon recited to his Anglo-Saxon adversary, who was taking the oath, the formula of the oath, clause by clause, in the Anglo-Saxon tongue. As the Norman did not understand Anglo- Saxon, he could not be constrained to have the oath dictated to him by the Anglo-Saxon, and to repeat it word for word; he was allowed to swear a simple oath, without observance of words recited, and, as we may well assume, in his mother tongue. In the Leges Henrici (64, ? 3) this privilege of the Erancigena appears as the special right of the alienigena in general. The German legal sources also are acquainted with the exemption of the foreigner from the "staved oath " (gestabter tEid, the iuramen/um frac/run of Anglo- Norman law). Chapter IV contains a valuable discussion of the relation of Eng- lish law to Roman and to canon law. Of the two it was the canon law that exercised by far the more important influence. In antithesis to the legal development of Germany, the clergy in England supported the national law against the Roman law. The royal judges, by whom the English common law was elevated from a rude mass of uncertain customs into a consolidated and harmonious system, were church- men loyal to the king. Chapter V, "The Age of Glanvill," deals with the reforms of Henry II, which introduced the jury of proof into judicial procedure and laid the basis for the development of the procedure by writ, "the strongest bulwark against the Romanizing of the English law." The history of the curia regis and of the courts that branched off from it is excellently narrated. Acute are the remarks upon Glan- vill's Tractatus, regarding which the conjecture is expressed that it was not composed by Glanvill himself, but by his secretary, Hubert Walter. On page 123 it is declared to be probable that Henry II introduced the recognitions in Normandy before he became king of England. According to the position of the documents in the Liber ANiger Capizuli Baiocensis, it is, in my judgment, indubitable that the introduction of the recognitions in Normandy took place not later than I 150-II152, and thus preceded the similar measures of Henry II in England, and served as a model for them. Of course the decisive documents cannot be used in the form in which they are printed by</page><page sequence="5">538 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY. [VOL. XI. Bigelow, who did not know how to date them. For the explanation of Magna Car/a, c. 38 " Nullus ballivus ponat de cetero aliquem ad legem (I217: ad legem manifestam nec ad iuramentum) simplici loquela sua sine testibus fidelibus ad hoc inductis," I permit myself to refer to a privilege of Eleonore of 1146, (printed in Giry, Etab- lissements de Rouen, II, 72): "Impetebant servientes seu ministri nostri quemlibet hominem Vindocinensis ecclesie in praefata insula (Oleron) de quolibet forisfacto absque presentis testis productione et imposite culpe purgationem nisi per duellum vel per calide aque iudicium nolebant recipere." This unreasonable consuetudo, known as the aAAellatio regis, was abolished. In the chapter on " The Age of Bracton," a period in which no other living legal historian is so thoroughly at home as the editor of Bracton's Note Book, the work increases in strength and interest. From the abundance of suggestive thoughts I single out the remark made in connection with the different fate of the Roman law in Eng- land and in Scotland: " Romanism must come sooner or later; the later it comes the purer and the stronger it will be " (vol. i, p. 202). This is completely true as regards the reception of the Roman law in France and in Germany. The second book begins with an instructive description of tenures The No/i/ia de Servi/io Monas/&amp;eiorurn, cited on page 221, cannot be dated with certainty from the year 817, and we have it only in a text fabricated by a Septimanian forger. On page 254, note I, instead of Warnkonig, Franzdsische S/aats- und.Rechtsgeschichte, II, 86, the citation should be: Delisle, Recueil de Jugoemen/s de l'Echiqzier, No. 304, where the passage is printed in a better and more intelligible text. As re- gards the history of the assisa utrum, one of the oldest and longest- lived of the recognitions, it is possible, I believe, to reach somewhat more substantial results. In Normandy it had, from the start, a petitory character. Only in case the recogni/io yielded no result because no valid verdict was obtained, was the possession at the moment decisive of the question whether the ensuing controversy was to be conducted before the ecclesiastical or before the secular court. In England the assize appeared at first as a possessory procedure; it did not lead to a final decision, but from the start sought only to determine whether the ecclesiastical or the secular court was the competent forum. From the time of Glanvill on, the action acquired more and more a petitory character, until it became the real writ of right of the churchman. That Henry II, in the Constitutions of Clar- endon, gave the assisa utrum in England a merely provisory char-</page><page sequence="6">No. 3.] THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LA W. 539 acter, departing in this respect from the Norman usage, may be regarded as a prudent consideration of the feelings of the English clergy, whom he did not desire to antagonize at that time in ques- tions of ecclesiastical property also. In the discussion of the alienation of fees, the remark is made that " Glanvill nowhere says or implies that the tenant cannot alienate his land without his lord's consent " (vol. i, p. 313). In my judgment it is an unavoidable inference from what Glanvill says (vii, I, 9), that he regarded an alienation without the cooperation of the feudal lord as admissible only in the way of subinfeudation. Otherwise Glanvill could not have excluded altogether the reversion of land bestowed by the father on the son, by virtue of the rule, "nemo eiusdem tenementi simul potest esse heres et dominus "; for this presupposed the impossibility of a gift in which the ancestor who made the gift renounced the position of dominus, that is, it presupposed the in- admissibility of alienation by way of substitution. In the following chapter, "The Sorts and Conditions of Men," special mention should be made of the careful investigation of the law of juristic persons. Injustice is done to Gierke in describing his theory as " anthropomorphic," for it proceeds from the assump- tion that, even in early times, human associations as well as human beings were the subjects or holders of rights. Of great interest are the remarks regarding the use of the word corona, and regarding the personification of the crown and the more abstract view of the kingship that date from the thirteenth century. The basis of the authors' argument would of course disappear if it were true that as early as the time of ?thelbirht the sum of fifty shillings was to be paid to the " crown " in case of homicide. In the passage in ques- tion (Athelbirht, 6) drihtinbiage is in fact translated by Reinhold Schmid "ruler's crown" (Herrscherkrone). Beag, however, should not here be translated "crown." Kentish royalty knew neither crown nor coronation: b&amp;ag is to be understood in this passage, like the Norse baugr, as referring to the due that makes part of the wergeld; and drihtinbiage, as Konrad Maurer has already remarked, is to be translated " lord's ring " (Herrenring). The chapter entitled "Jurisdiction and the Communities of the Land " reaches over, in part, into the field of public law and treats of the position of the counties, hundreds, vills and townships, of seignorial jurisdiction, manor and borough. Special pains are de- voted to answering the question whether, and to what extent, cor- porate property or legal community existed in these associations.</page><page sequence="7">540 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY. [VoL. XI. In discussing the concepts of manor and borough, the procedure of the authors seems to me a little too skeptical. The second volume of the work begins with the chapter " Owner- ship and Possession." It contains the substance of the legal rules which we Germans are in the habit of grouping together as " law of things " (Sachenrecht), and it is one of the most brilliant parts of The History of English Law. The requirement of real delivery in the conveyance of real estate, and the abolition of symbolic modes of conveyance are shown to be the permanent result of the transient influence which the study of Roman law exerted upon English legal development. To the same influence is ascribed the origin of the rule that refuses to the termor the assisa novae dissaisinae. Henry II's system of possessory actions prevented any such distinction as arose in the German legal development between seizin (gewere) according to territorial law (Landrecht) and according to feudal law (Lehnrecht). The free alienation of land was attained in England at a relatively early period, because it was favored by the curia regis. Unreserved praise is due to the discussion of the bases of the protection of pos- session. It is one of the best contributions that has come from the legal-historic side to the literature of the subject, and it shows that the one-sided possessory theories are as inadequate to explain the historical development as are the equally one-sided penal-law theories -a lesson which should be taken to heart elsewhere than in England. The question whether the relativity of property right is of primitive origin is raised (vol. ii, p. 77), but is left unanswered. I would unhesitatingly answer it in the affirmative. The ius maius in the Breve de recto, from which is derived the English ius merum (dreyt dreyt), has a prototype in the Frankish law, which in contro- versies touching land or freedom calls for proof of the better right of him to whom the proof is assigned. The remark of Bracton (fol. 53): Aliud est dare ecclesiam et aliud dare advocationem. Laici tamen secundum communem usum propter eorum simplicitatem dant ecclesias, quod nihil aliud est dicere quam praesentare, which is cited on page 135 of the second volume, gives a valuable indication touching the origin of advowsons. As has been shown by the investigations of Ulrich Stutz,' the right of patronage or advowson is nothing but a remnant of the former Germanic owner- ship of the private church. The laity in England, as we see from 1 Die Eigenkirche als Element des mittelalterlich-germanischen Kirchen- rechts (X895), p. 25. Geschichte des kirchlichen Benefizialwesens (X895), vol. i.</page><page sequence="8">No. 3.] THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LA W. 541 Bracton, were holding fast to the original point of view even after the papacy had carried to a successful issue its struggle against private ownership of churches. The history of the law of pledge or "gage" is set forth briefly but not very clearly. In this matter the authors do not go back of Domesday Book. The discussion of the forms of the gage of land starts with Glanvill. In treating of this matter it would have been especially worth while to reach back into the Anglo-Saxon period; for Anglo-Saxon documents give us, on the one hand, examples of gage with right of use on the part of the gagee (NutzungsSfand), including both the German Todsatzuzng1 (the Norman vifgage) and the German Zinssatzung' (Glanvill's vadium mortuum), and, on the other hand, prototypes of the classical English mortgage, particularly a gage in the form of a conditional conveyance, which in the Anglo-Saxon period could take place by means of delivery of the land-book. In addition to the citations given in my Rechtsgeschichte der romischen und germanischen Urkunde (vol. i, pp. 195 et seq.), we have recently ob- tained a new bit of evidence, an indorsement of ioi8 in Napier and Stevenson, The Crawford Collection of Early Charters and Documents (Anecdota Oxoniensia, 1895, p. 9): "Ic gesealde hym ane gyrde landes to underwedde." In this instance the creditor obtained the position of a tenant for life. Gage in the form of conveyance under condition subsequent was certainly already in existence -or, to speak more precisely, still in existence - in the time of Glanvill. He, however, had no occasion to discuss it, because the transaction wore the legal form of a feoffment under condition subsequent, and it was only from the economic point of view that it served to secure a debt. What Glanvill does discuss at some length is the older gage (Satzung) of the German law, which became impracticable in England and had no future there, because the gagee did not have the pos- sessory action. Again, that form of gage which the authors desig- nate as the " Bractonian gage for years " was not altogether a new creation of the period after Glanvill; it had its prototype in the conveyance under condition precedent which we find employed for the purpose of pledge as early as the Frankish period. In the chapter on contracts, the authors inquire (vol. ii, p. 21, note 2) how the popular custom is to be explained that knives or other weapons or weapon-like things were not given, i.e. donated, but that the gift was cloaked in the form of a sale. In German Austria, [1 In the so-called Zinssatzung (as in the Roman antichresis) the gagee treated the yield or profit as interest on the money due him. In the Todsatung the yield or profit was deducted, as it accrued, from the principal of the debt. - EDS.]</page><page sequence="9">542 POLITICAL SC'IENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. XI. and probably in other places, the superstition exists that such a gift will produce discord between the donor and the donee. Such things, if given, cut love in two, sever friendship.' The idea which underlies the Launegild will not serve alone to explain the superstition; for other things, not sharp or dangerous, may be given. Is it not possible that some influence has been exercised by the idea that if the donee should hurt himself with the weapon he might hold the donor respon- sible as the causa remota of his injury ? Chapter VI, "Inheritance," suggests a series of interesting prob- lems. The authors proceed on the assumption that Anglo-Saxon law did not demand, for alienation of realty, the consent of the heirs. They concede, however (vol. ii, p. 251), that folk-land-which term signifies to them, as to Vinogradoff, land held by folk-law-was not as easily alienated as book-land. Considering the fact that the right of the heirs to object (Widerspruchsrechlt) was developed in full intensity among the old Saxons, it is a priori an improbability that the Anglo-Saxons started with unlimited freedom of alienation. The evidence afforded by the Anglo-Saxon sources is apparently conflict- ing. Side by side with transfers of land which took place without regard to the nearest heirs, alienations are attested in which children, parents or other relatives cooperated. There are also cases in which transfers made without the consent of the heirs were successfully attacked hereditaria procdamatione. Leaving out of consideration the special limitations that might be imposed in the case of book- land by the will of the donor, I believe that the solution of the apparent contradiction is to be found in the distinction between hereditary land and acquests. According to Leges Henrici (c. 70, 2i and c. 88, 14), it was permissible freely to alienate purchased land and other acquired land, but not hereditary property (hereditatem). The Nor- man law knew no such distinction. It permitted one to give (dare in elemosynam zedpro servitio suo) the third part of his real estate. One could sell it all, but the heirs had a droit de retrait. The distinction in the Leges Henrici, therefore, could be derived only from the Anglo- Saxon law. In Glanvill, who treats acquired land as completely free if its owner has hereditary land also, we seem to have a mixture of Norman and Anglo-Saxon customs; in the passage of Bracton in which he undertakes to distinguish, as regards burgagium, between inherited and acquired property and to put the latter on the same [1 The same custom, giving a penny when one receives a gift of a knife or pair of scissors, exists in many parts of the United States, and the reason assigned is the same. - EDS.]</page><page sequence="10">No. 3.] THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH LAW. 543 footing as movable property, there appears to be a reminiscence of Anglo-Saxon law. Among the grounds given to explain ultimogeniture (sometimes known as " borough English "), I miss the economic reason, which is decisive in the case of peasant holdings. If the oldest son receives the estate, he marries at once and begets children at a time when his younger brothers and sisters are not yet independent, but must be supported on the homestead. In most cases the estate cannot bear this economic burden: only the larger homesteads are equal to it. If the youngest son takes the land, then by the time that a new gen- eration is growing up on the homestead, the elder brothers and sisters of the heir have reached an age at which they can look out for their own maintenance. Admirably luminous is the explanation of the peculiar develop- ment by which, in England, the inheritance of movable property was taken out of the secular law and placed under the influence of the church. For the division of the personal estate into three parts, " wife's part, bairns' part, dead's part," the authors reject the theory of a Norman origin. This, I think, is a mistake, but I cannot attempt to prove the point here: I reserve this problem for a detailed investi- gation. For the present it may be sufficient to refer to chapter 207 of the Trs A4ncienne Coutume de Bretagne (in the recent edition of Planiol), where this triple division quite distinctly appears 1 as law of the burgesses and of the gens de basse condition. The history of family law, in which it is made particularly clear that the English law of matrimonial property was constructed to fit the conditions of the upper and wealthy class, I must pass over here, but not without expressing my sincere appreciation. As regards some special points, for example, the courtesy of England and the uxores Danicae, I have already set forth my opinion elsewhere.2 The careful treatment of " Crime and Tort" (ch. viii) and " Proced- ure " (ch. ix) offers the attentive reader keen enjoyment. I take special pleasure in observing that in these chapters the authors have fre- quently expressed their agreement with the views which I had set forth in earlier writings. By way of showing my gratitude, I must make known an unintentional misdeed which I committed in my essay on the Unintentional Misdeed.8 I cited there a law of Roger of Sicily, and 1 "Le tierz au mort, I'autre tierz i l'homme ou a la femme qui demoure, et I'autre tierz es enffanz d'iceulx deux." 2 Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung, XVI, 97; XVII, 19. 8 Ober absichtslose Missethat im altdeutschen Strafrechte.</page><page sequence="11">544 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY. the authors have taken the citation from me (vol. ii, p.480). In Merkel, Commentatio qua Zuris Siculi sive Assisiarum Regum Regni Siciiiae Fragmentaphropbonuntur, the passage reads precisely as I cited it: Qui de alto se ipsum precipitat et hominem occiderit et ramum incautus prohiciens non proclamaverit seu lapidem ad aliud iecit hominemque occidit, capitali sententia feriatur. The passage corresponds with our knowledge derived from other sources regarding the treatment of unintended misdeeds in Germanic criminal law; but as I have subsequently discovered from Brandile- one, ii Diritto Romano nelle Legge Normanne del Regno di Sicilia (I884), P. II 7, Merkel, in copying the manuscript which he printed, made an incomprehensible mistake. After the word "1 occidit " the codex&gt; in practical agreement with its model, Dig. 48, 8, 7, contains the words: "huic pene non succumbit." Then follows a passage concerning poisoning, which ends, "' capitali sententia feriatur." Merkel com- pletely overlooked the passage about poisoning and substituted its final clause, " capitali sententia feriatur," for " huic pene non succumbit " after the word " occidit." That is a blunder which one would not expect on the part of a man like Merkel, whose labors on the Monumenta Germaniae Historica had given him the deserved reputation of an accurate editor. But " quandoque dormit Homerus." Merkel seems to have had a very unlucky day when he was collating, in Rome, the Codex Vaticanus, f. lat. no. 8782. The passage from Roger of Sicily is therefore in future to be omitted from the evidences of the doctrine of the unintentional misdeed; or, at the utmost, its insertion in the Sicilian statute may be taken as evidence that among the Normans of the period the ancient Germanic view of the unintentional misdeed had not wholly disappeared. But my review has already grown too long. When, thirty years ago, I began to occupy myself with the history of the English law, I often felt as if German and English legal history were separated by an impassable mountain range. Since that time the ceaseless labor of science has driven a tunnel through the heart of the mountains. In the successful excavation of this tunnel and in the work of making it traversable Pollock and Maitland have played a prominent part. BERLIN, June 2I, I896. HEINRICH BRUNNER.
