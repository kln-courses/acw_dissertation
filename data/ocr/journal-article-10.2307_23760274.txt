The artifacts are, with few exceptions, carved from igneous stone or, to a lesser degree, from limestone or sandstone. A mushroom stone consists structu rally of three parts: a base; a stem frequently embellished with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies; and a rough ly hemispherical upper part, which obviously resembles the cap of a mushroom. The base of a mushroom stone can consist of an oval, circular, or rectangular socle, and very fre quently has three (less often four) legs. The stem can bear incised designs, in some cases of human faces, and there are many examples where, between the base and the lower part of the stem, a three-dimensional effigy is depicted. Such effigies can be standing, seated, or crouching human figures or zoomorphic créatures. The animais commonly represen ted are felines, monkeys, frogs or toads, and birds. The dimensions of these mushroom stones range from 8 cm to 40 cm, although the majority have an average height of about 30 cm. Mushroom stones occur predominantly in the Highlands and Pacific Coast régions of Guatemala, but many specimens have also been found in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Tabasco, and even in El Salvador. Given the fact that only a few mushroom stones have corne to light in scientifically controlled excavations their chronological placement is doubtful for the most part. The présent State of our knowledge indicates that the first such stones were carved in the Early or Middle Preclassic (ca. 1000-300 B.C.) and the latest in the Late Classic period (ca. A.D. 600-900). The original function of these specialized artifacts is still unknown, although a series of hypothetical explanations have been offered, none with sufficient power to convince. The enigmatic sculptures have been variously interpreted as having served to shape and manufacture culi nary and utilitarian pottery items, or rubber balls for the ritual ballgame, or to mark the boundary of a Community or ballcourt. Other scholars have interpreted them as stools, idols in phallic worship, and as représentations of actual mushrooms, which were used in a cuit involving the inges tion of inebriating and hallucinogenic fungi; of the many divergent hypothèses concerning the function of mushroom stones, the one that is currently in vogue regards them as representing or symbolizing hallucinogenic or 'sacred' mushrooms, despite the lack of any definitive evidence for this. m 3 " . h I ml Among the several Precolumbian mushroom stones in the Musée de l'Homme, Paris, is a sculpture carved of volcanic stone and allegedly from Tamahu, Departamento Alta Ver apaz, Guatemala (cover photo, Fig. 1 ). Its catalogue number is MH 54.41.81. The total height for the sculpture is 32.5 cm, its base is rectangular and measures 3.5 cm high, 15 cm wide, and 14 cm deep. The anthropomorphic sculpture depicts a half seated - half kneeling figure with a mushroom 'hat'. This hat is 13.5 cm in diameter and 6.5 cm in height. The number for the negative used here with the kind permission of the Musée de l'Homme is D.65.3932-493. Another mushroom stone in the same muséum, with catalogue number MH 97.31.4, is of a very common type: a tripod sculpture with a human face carved onto the cylindrical stem, and a flat cap (Fig. 2). This carving is of volcanic stone, 23.2 cm high, and comes allegedly from Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala. The photo graph (No. C-65.2135-493) is reproduced here courtesy of the Musée de l'Homme.
