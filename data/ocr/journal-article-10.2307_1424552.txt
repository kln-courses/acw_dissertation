<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dimensions: Space, shape and scale in architecture, by Charles Moore and Gerald Allen. New York: Architectural Record Books, 1976. In their new book Moore and Allen attempt to articulate a theory of pluralist architecture. The argument is limited by their bias towards the perceptual expe- rience of architecture over the "abstract, formal construct" which they imply exists only in the architect's mind. The book lacks a consistent theoretical base-it is an enter- taining personal ramble through architec- tural history, at times illuminating but often self-contradictory. The primary focus of the book concerns the argument surrounding inclusive vs ex- clusive architecture. According to Allen, exclusive architecture, by limiting the range of images and forms it emulates, "excludes the observe from choice-he can only accept or reject the choices made by the architect." Inclusive architecture, because it "embraces a multiple of disparate refer- ences" allows the observer to participate via his interpretive role. Any architecture bases its images and forms on a variety of models. The critical question for a particular archi- tecture would be, not whether aspects of a culture are excluded or included, but which aspects are chosen, and why. It is a question which Moore and Allen do not address with clarity. At one point the discussion leaves the realm of architecture and becomes reminis- cent of Marshall McLuhan and Futurism. "Our new places are given form with elec- tronic, rather than visual, glue. .... The freeways could be the real monuments of the future, the places set aside for special celebration by people able to experience space and light and relationships to other people at a speed only this century has allowed." The architectural implications of such statements are never made clear. Gerald Allen seems closer to an under- standing of our current disenchantment with modern architecture in his careful analysis of Rockefeller Plaza. He attributes its success to its physical enclosiveness, programmatic vitality, symbolic use of de- corative ornament and anthropomorphic identification with traditional architectural elements such as doors and windows. If, as Moore claims, the "one true architecture (is) electronic architecture," this would seem antithetical to the traditional architec- tural values represented by Allen's analysis. The modern movement's emphasis on abstraction resulted in a loss of our anthro- pomorphic identification with the elements of architecture. Moore and Allen represent an over-reaction. In defending the primacy of perceptual experience, they omit the need for conceptual order. The perceptual and conceptual modes are not mutually exclusive. Both are essential to an architec- ture of pluralism-Caroline B Constant, Princeton, New Jersey. 32</page></plain_text>
