<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW Brian Cosgrove Brian Moore and the Price of Freedom in a Secular World Georg Lukacs has not been the only one to hail Don Quixote as "the first great novel of world literature", but his reasons for so doing are more interesting than most. For Lukacs, in The Theory of the Novel, Don Quixote ushers in the genre of the novel as "the epic of a world which has been abandoned by God"; and Quixote is the type of the subjective consciousness, alienated in a world of "immanent meaninglessness" which must find "meaning and substance" only within itself. Or, to summarise this in slightly different terms, Don Quixote, according to Lukacs, "is the first great battle of interiority against the prosaic vulgarity of outward life .. ."1 The wide-ranging applicability of that last formula is immediately apparent if we think of Flaubert's Madame Bovary; and bovarysme may be regarded as a logical extension of the quixotic. Emma Bovary is perhaps the greatest recent prototype of the subjective consciousness alienated in a world which offers no intrinsic substance or meaning (or at least an insufficiency of those); her natural heirs include Joyce's Stephen in A Portrait, and some of the heroines of a novelist who was inevitably influenced by Joyce, especially by A Portrait: Brian Moore. In this essay, the main texts for consideration are Judith Hearne (1955) and The Doctor's Wife (1976).2 The two salient features of the account given by Lukacs of the emergence of the novel genre may be summarised as follows. The novel is a response to a fully secular world, in which, if God is to be "known" at all, he is to be known as absence rather than as presence. And secondly, faced with this secular or neutral world, the subjective self creates its sense of meaning only from within itself, by recourse to what, positively or romantically, we would call the imagination, or, less confidently and with a modernist commitment to the ironic, we would evaluate as mere fantasy. Among the writers of this century, we might 1. The Theory of the Novel (1920; transl Anna Bostock, London, 1971), pp. 88,103-4. 2. In "Bovarysm and the Irish Novel" (Irish University Review, 7.2 (Autumn, 1977), Patrick Rafroidi traces the presence of bovarysme in Irish fiction, including Ulysses and Moore's The Doctor's Wife. His treatment of Sheila Redden's transition from "vain dreams'* and "the make-believe world of books" to a point where she "faces up to her situation" (pp. 242-43) is substantially in agreement with my own reading, though rather less detailed. 3. See The Critical Writings of James Joyce, ed. Ellsworth Mason and Richard Ellmann (London, 1959), pp.44-45. 59</page><page sequence="2">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW let Yeats or Stevens represent the positive view; the ironic view is adequately represented by Joyce who, as early as 1900, in his paper on "Drama and Life", had given his allegiance to "the dreary sameness of existence", unrelieved by the "traditions of romance" or, for that matter, by a privileged and transformative imagination.3 In this negative evaluation, imagination is clearly rated as delusive fantasy: an estimate already implicit in Don Quixote and severely insisted upon in Flaubert. I want to argue that Brian Moore, responding from his own cultural background to the problematic identified by Lukacs, adopts what I have called the negative view. Indeed, the recurrent sense of dilemma engendered in Moore's writing arises from the twofold recognition that the world is indeed secular and empty, but that the human imagination is unable to fill that void; that is to say, if there is no God to redeem the world, then no assertion or manifestation of creative human energies can do that for us either. It is this stance which in large part accounts for Moore's almost ascetic distaste for fantasy; and in its uncompromising realism, suggests why Moore's aesthetic commitment should be to the mode of naturalism, often of a bleak and un-redeemed kind. Michael Paul Gallagher's observation, made as long ago as 1971, that Judith Hearne is "a Belfast version of Emma Bovary"4 seems increasingly astute with the passing years. Judith's instinctive recourse is to a world of fantasy, best epitomized, perhaps, in the opening sequence of Chapter VII, where, seated beside James Madden in the darkness of the cinema, her imagination projects herself into the role of Delilah, and Madden into that of Samson. As with Emma Bovary, the fantasies are charged with erotic content: though instead of the books which stimulate Emma's (as earlier Don Quixote's) imagination, it is the "dream factory" of Hollywood which offers the fantasies to Judith "ready-made". (In Judith Hearne, "Hollywood" becomes Moore's most convenient short-hand for destructive, often erotic, fantasy: and there is both irony and inevitability in the fact that Moore himself was to end up, for a period of his life, in California). Judith's resort to alcohol is best understood as an aspect of her recourse to fantasy: as early as Chapter III, with reference to Madden, the connection between "dream" and "drunkenness" is clearly established (p.42).5 But if Judith dreams and drinks, it is because there is nothing in her personal or cultural world to provide a sense of 4.

The edition of Judith Hearne here and subsequently cited is that of the New Canadian Library (Toronto/Montreal, 1964). 60</page><page sequence="3">PRICE OF FREEDOM substantial meaning: this, too, is a world abandoned to "immanent meaningless" (the words of Lukacs), in the face of which fantasizing is the natural (if futile) response. What adds the special cultural dimension to this meaninglessness, and gives it a special poignancy, is the very proximity of such a secular world to a potential source of religious meaning in the form of Irish Catholicism. That poignancy first clearly emerges in Judith's reflection in Chapter IV as Sunday Mass ends and she emerges from the security of the church to "the contradictions and unsureties of the streets": It was as though she had said her say, used all her arguments before a great and all-powerful judge and now the defence rested, the arguments were over and the decision would be announced in a dead anti-climax by some unknown secular juryman in the streets, away from the House of God and the surety of prayer and good intention, (p.57). The initial tragic recognition here is that the "House of God" does not really impinge upon the secular "streets"; if God is present in his House, he is still absent from the world at large. Thus Judith's pathetic prayer that Madden should be her companion and guide, the one to help her conquer her wicked tendency to alcoholism ? for it is that that has been preoccupying her thoughts ? seems already fated to remain unanswered: the potency of the divine does not reach as far as such secular affairs. But whatif the case is more problematic even than this? What if God is not present in his own House either? In a close reading of Chapter IV, what must strike us as an ominous omission is Moore's failure to include any account of the distribution and reception of Holy Communion: for it is in the Eucharist that, according to Catholic teaching, God is truly and fully present. Moore instead devotes most of the chapter to the narrow, authoritarian moralism of Father Quigley's sermon: in this society, in this culture, God is not a loving presence but a punitive nay-sayer, ultimately a force for repression that duplicates the activities of the exacting superego. It is no wonder that, to Judith, the Sacred Heart is not just "guide and comforter^, but "her terrible judge" (p. 51); his eyes are "kindly yet accusing" (p. 9). And Judith's dilemma, in psychological terms, is to be seen in her vacillation between rebelliousness (necessary to her own self-realization) against the authority figures (perhaps parental surrogates) of the Sacred Heart and her Aunt D'Arcy, and her subsequent submissions to these same authorities, accepted now as stable points of reference in an increasingly chaotic (and alcoholic) world. 61</page><page sequence="4">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW The final submission is always made (and it contributes to the poignancy of the closing paragraphs); but it is easy to underestimate Judith's capacity for rebelliousness. Michael Paul Gallagher may be overstating the case when he sees in Judith an "almost total passivity" (Studies, p. 184); John Wilson Foster tends to give a similar impression in Forces and Themes in Ulster Fiction (Dublin, 1974). The strength and integrity of Judith are vividly illustrated in the way in which, in Chapter XIII, she asserts her loyalty to the Sacred Heart and to Catholicism against the facile atheism of Bernard (to whom the Sacred Heart is "only an idealized picture of a minor prophet": p. 132). It is, paradoxically, this same strength of assertion which allows her to entertain the rebellious notion that God does not exist: specifically, that the God who refuses to give her the "sign" she repeatedly asks for in the secular world, is not present either in his own "House". The symbolic focus for this invisible God is the "screened" tabernacle on the altar (p. 143). What if, behind that screen, is not the Real Presence ? the "unseen Presence behind the little golden door" (p. 102) ? but "only bread"? And if it is only bread? If no one hears? No one. No one. The church, an empty shell, nobody to hear, no reason to pray, only statues listen. Statues cannot hear. And if I am alone? (p. 145). There is something heroic in Judith's willingness to push her desire for truth to these extremes: the climax of her quest comes in Chapter XVIII, when, in her frantic and drunken state, she ascends the altar, determined to discover once and for all what lies behind the tabernacle's golden door: But the door would not open. Small, golden Holy of Holies, it remained shut against her trembling, weeping onslaught. 'Open. Let me in', she screamed. 'In!' the church screamed back. Tn!' But the door rejected her_(p. 173). Judith is subsequently, in Chapter XX, to infer that there must be no God, since her defiance of him (as "defiler of His temple", p. 173) brought about no retribution: "In God's house I defied God. And nothing happened. I am here" (p. 181). Logically, then, one would expect that Judith will end up in a neutral void: the culmination of a 62</page><page sequence="5">PRICE OF FREEDOM process she fully acknowledges when, in the hotel room, she notes: "I'm free. I'm ? falling" (p. 153). But her fall into the void is not absolute, in large part because the destruction of all of Judith's previous stabilities would be more than her psychological constitution could bear. So it is that we can read the conclusion, in which she reinstates the pictures of the Sacred Heart and her aunt, as a sentimental regression to a mode of existence which is, sadly, inauthentic. Faced with what Nietzsche calls "dangerous knowledge", not all of us are capable of following his injunction that we think the matter "thoroughly through to the bottom and resist all sentimental weakness" (Beyond Good and Evil; Sections 23, 259). In this reading, then, a summary of Judith's predicament would run as follows: although her experience has led her to the conclusion that there is no God, she still clings to the supreme fiction of comforting "presence", symbolized in the two pictures (the Sacred Heart and her aunt) "watching over" her, making an alien world a "home" (p. 1841 Such a fiction can come to seem more potent than "reality" itself: Aunt D'Arcy's picture, she reflects, is "More real now than aunt herself (p. 184). Are we to assume likewise that the "fictional" Sacred Heart is "more real", more fully present, than the God it iconizes? If so, then the presence of God can be validated only in this fictive way; and the question that arises is whether, for Moore, such a recourse to the fictive on Judith's part is only a more refined version of her gross fantasizing earlier. Yet the evidence might seem to suggest that the fictions of faith ?creative and supportive in their effect ? are to be somewhat differently evaluated than the destructive fictions of fantasy. For if Moore seems certain that fantasy points to total vacuity, he is less certain that faith points only to a total void. Moore is prepared to allow that Real Absence is at the heart of the matter rather than Real Presence: but to say that God is invisible is not to say absolutely that God does not exist. If God is known only as absence, then that God can still, in some measure, be known. In the passage in which Judith assaults the tabernacle, one cannot ignore the force of the curious anthropomorphism, "the door rejected her" (p. 173): even if this is the account of things as registered through Judith's consciousness, the sense of an invisible agency choosing to withhold itself is still very strong. Moreover, if the alternative to faith is a world peopled by creatures like the cynical, predatory and atheistic Bernard, then the rhetoric of Moore's fiction urges us to entertain the validity of faith if only in pragmatic moral terms. The strongest of any such pragmatic arguments, as Moore is fully aware, arises from the moral need to cherish the suffering, the outcast, the marginalized in human society. 63</page><page sequence="6">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW This is, as Judith herself realises at the end of Chapter XIX, a task for which merely human friendship is not adequate: for friends, being merely human, either "resent" you or "feel sorry for you". Figures like Judith Hearne require both justice and compassion, but mere human nature is not up to that task: "No one is Christ" (p. 180). Or, as much earlier in Chapter XII Judith comes to realise, her "friends" the O'Neills cannot arrive at a just estimate of her situation: "They don't understand, they never will, they've never been me" (p. 121). If such alienated subjectivity as is herein suggested is, as in the thesis of Lukacs, related to a world abandoned by God, then Moore's contention would seem to be that it can only be reached and accommodated by a more-than-human reality which in effect would reinstate the divine that Lukacs posits as absent. Moore, in effect, sees no middle way between "immanent meaninglessness" and the recovery of God: even if, realistically and perhaps stoically, he accepts meaninglessness as a more immediate prospect than any such recovery (about which he betrays no enthusiasm). If this either/or formula is a just representation of his views, then we might accuse him of an important sin of omission: he has allowed no place for communal or political reality. The only community acknowledged at all in Judith Hearne is the somewhat factitious one evident in the attendance at Sunday Mass: "The special thing about Sunday Mass was that for once everyone was doing the same thing. Age, income, situation in life, it made no difference. ..." (p. 46). But even here, as elsewhere, the community degenerates to an anonymous "crowd of worshippers" which coughs, jostles, whispers, and shuffles (p. 51). The same "crowd" appears in the cinema (" 'Oooh!' sighed the one and ninepennies", p. 72) and, more vindictively, in the old women in Earnscliffe House, one of whom foils Judith's attempt to bring some alcoholic solace to Edie Marrinan (p. 160). Moore does not seem to admit the possibility of a regenerative momentum arising out of such a community: in his failure to envisage any political alteration ? a fact which contributes to the extremely static image of Belfast projected in the pages of the novel ? he is very much of his time and background (having left the North before any such political change was on the horizon). Failing the miraculous self-revelation of an invisible and absent (or perhaps non-existent) God, the world of Judith Hearne is bleakly left to its own devices. One such device is subjective fantasy, of which Judith herself (like Emma Bovary) is, to a large extent, painfully purged. But she is denied any revelation as to the "reason" for her suffering (p. 172); and beside her repeated request ? "I need a sign ... I need a sign from God" (p. 169) ? the reader may choose to place that haunting image of semiotic failure which Judith sees from her hotel window, at five o'clock in the 64</page><page sequence="7">PRICE OF FREEDOM morning, as she gazes on a desolate Royal Avenue: "Traffic lights flashed red, amber, and green in empty futility" (p. 153). In Moore's world, the symbolic short-circuits. If Judith Hearne is a Belfast version of Emma Bovary, then the affinity between the heroine of The Doctor's Wife and the heroine of Flaubert's novel is even more striking.6 Unlike Judith (who suffers under the classical dictum casta est quam nemo rogavit), Mrs. Sheila Redden has, like Madame Bovary, the opportunity to translate vague longings into erotic reality. In both cases, however, it is the vague longings ? for the exotic or the cosmopolitan ? that we are first made aware of; and, like Emma Bovary, Sheila Redden has nurtured her imagination on books. "Always stuck into books", her embittered husband Kevin reflects late in the novel: "Poetry, plays, and novels. A lot of rot. He remembered her chatting with Brian Boland about 'modern writers'. Rubbish" (p. 205). Emma Bovary finds early stimulus in Paul and Virginia, and the novels of Sir Walter Scott, whence "she conceived a passion for the historical, and dreamed about oak chests, guardrooms, minstrels" (MadameBovary, pp. 48,50). Married to an increasingly dull husband, whose "ardours had lapsed into a routine" (p. 56), Emma longs for "escape" (p. 80) from her provincial incarceration: The whole of her immediate environment ? dull countryside, imbecile petty bourgeois, life in its ordinariness ? seemed a freak, a particular piece of bad luck that had seized on her; while beyond, as far as eye could see, ranged the vast lands of passion and felicity, (p. 72). In the case of Sheila Redden, the boredom in her life arises, like Emma's, from a dull husband and even duller environment: this latter now updated as the province of Ulster in the nineteen-seventies, ravaged by meaningless violence and obsessed with futile political conversations. Sheila has known "escape" (p. 41) in the past, having spent a summer in Paris in her student days; but she has also known, even prior to the beginning of the northern "Troubles", the renewed sense of provincial incarceration when, after that momentary escape, she has had to return: the sadness when the summer was over and she returned to Queen's for four more years of study, locked up in Ulster for four more years of her life. (p. 42). 6. Subsequently the citations are from the Penguin Classics edn. of Madame Bovary, transl. by Alan Russell (1950; repr. Harmondsworth, 1984); and The Doctor's Wife (Jonathan Cape: London, 1976). 65</page><page sequence="8">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW Now a supposedly mature married woman, she still longs to "sail away from all of the things that hold and bind me, to sail away, to start again in some city like Brussels or Amsterdam" (p. 40). In a familiar Irish ?or, more specifically, if we think of "The Dead" or A Portrait, Joycean ? handling of the theme of escape, she thinks of continental Europe as the focus of exotic possibility: this European dimension having appealed to her imagination from her childhood days in the person of her Uncle Dan, Irish Ambassador to Holland. She recalls visiting his "splendid place", the Irish Embassy in The Hague, when she was only twelve (pp. 68-69). This kind of childhood memory, we should note, significantly complicates the issue: for Sheila's desire to escape is also, perhaps, a longing to return to innocence. But, initially, at least, like Madame Bovary her attention is directed to the possibility of an open future: and while Emma Bovary is haunted by an image of the future as "an unlighted corridor with a stoutly locked door at the end of it" (Madame Bovary, p. 76), Sheila takes heart, as she prepares to fly from Paris to Nice, from a newspaper caption placed under the photograph of the deceased Georges Pompidou, "Uavenirn'est interdit a personne, the future is forbidden to no one" (The Doctor's Wife, p. 48). Sheila Redden is on the whole more sympathetically treated than her Flaubertian prototype: but, like Judith Hearne (indeed, like all the descendants of Cervantes' Don), she can be a self-indulgent fantasist. Thus we are told of her habit of masturbating to her sexual imaginings in her hot bath (p. 55: the connection between "imagining" and masturbating has been "officially" established since at least the time of Rousseau's Confessions). Moore's presentation of this kind of episode is strictly neutral and non-judgemental: but there is some truth in the jibes of Sheila's husband, Kevin, about her "ignoring the facts of life, dancing in the dark" (p. 39: the song Dancing in the Dark becomes a running motif). Even as a child, as she confesses to Tom Lowry, Sheila has been incapable of accepting the "facts of life": 'Oh, when I was small I was always making up stories about myself. That I was an explorer's daughter, or related to some famous person. Anything but the truth ? that I was Sheila Deane of 18 Chichester Terrace, Belfast, a very ordinary little girl'. (P-74) It is easy, then, to establish the general parallels between Moore's heroine and Flaubert's: both in their different ways are lured away from the restrictions of the factual by the prospect of "passion and felicity" {Madame Bovary, p.72). But it would be wrong to allow Moore's own unique fictional creation to be definitively shaped 66</page><page sequence="9">PRICE OF FREEDOM according to the pressures of a Flaubertian wr-text. The Doctor's Wife is possibly more "open", more indeterminate than Madame Bovary: its movement is profoundly exploratory, as it seeks to formulate problematic questions rather than suggest resolutions. It is clear, for example, that the fantasies of Judith and the other characters in Judith Hearne are morally "placed" in a way in which the more fully achieved neutrality of presentation in The Doctor's Wife does not seek to emulate. Recognising the potentially destructive or self-destructive nature of fantasy in the case of Sheila Redden, Moore is more deeply engaged by a larger question: to what extent can the individual achieve a total freedom that would constitute the ultimate happiness of self realisation? For "escape" here is not just the bovarysme of a "restless" nature (it is her brother Owen who reflects on this "restless side of her", p. 145); it is also, as Sheila herself realises, a deliberate attempt to find the self, to discover an alternative reality. So Owen recalls his final exchanges with Sheila in Paris: She said, 'Kevin used to tell me that life wasn't all dancing in the dark. You know that old song. He said I was impractical, that I never faced facts. He was wrong. If I'd been impractical I'd never have married him. I'd have gone off to London or Paris and tried for a job, no matter how impractical that sounds. If I'd been romantic I would have tried for a different life'. 'But you might not have found it', I said to her. 'Yes, that's true', she said. 'But I would have tried. That's what I blame myself for now. I didn't try". (p. 190) The possibility of an alternative reality is offered her by the youthful Tom Lowry; and it is necessary to consider in some detail the nature of that alternative. Readers who come to The Doctor's Wife for the first time are usually startled by the erotic charge of the scenes of love making between Sheila and Tom: but these scenes in all their detail are profoundly relevant and functional. Essential to these early sexual encounters (pp. 85-86, 90-92) is the sense of inhibitions overcome, taboos broken: Tom first makes love to her in the unorthodox position whereby he enters from behind (she at first fears he means to effect anal penetration, and, even though her fears are unfounded, the sense of taboo activity is considerably enhanced); later he encourages oral genital stimulation. We have already seen that Judith Hearne is the victim of a repressive morality, an exacting superego perhaps symbolised in the "parental" icons of Sacred Heart and Aunt D'Arcy; as such, her "fall" into freedom can never be total. What Sheil^i Redden is offered ? appropriately in Villefranche, "Freetown" ? is a full 67</page><page sequence="10">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW substantiation of that "passion, sublime freedom" that Judith can only fantasize about (see Judith Hearne, pp. 103-4). If there is no God, Judith's argument there runs, then there is no sin; if no sin, then anything is permitted. This is the morally neutral "space" in which Tom and Sheila couple; Moore's own exploratory movement leads him to pose the possibility that such passionate freedom not only engenders happiness ? Emma Bovary's "felicity" ? but innocence as well, as the neutral "space" is spontaneously appropriated. This, I take it, is the point of Sheila's own surprised recognition that even though she is "committing adultery", is guilty of "sin", she is totally possessed by a "pure feeling of peace". It was, she reflects, "as though wrong were right"; and she concludes, "I am in grace. In my state of grace" (p. 101) I said that Sheila's desire to escape is possibly complicated by a desire for a return to innocence. Moore seems to insist on this paradoxical conjunction of the erotic and the innocent in those scenes where the naked lovers are like playing children: She stood up on the bed, running her panty hose as she pulled them down. She took off the rest of her clothes and, naked, stood above him as he bent over, his back to her, pulling down his trousers. She waited until he was naked, then, unsteadily, crossed the soft expanse of mattress and climbed onto him, piggyback, as she had done with her father when a child. Laughing, he caught her legs, holding his hands out like stirrups, and with her arms around his neck, both of them naked, raced into the livingroom, then, wheeling, ran down the corridor into the kitchen, as she spurred him, her stallion, with her naked heels. 'Back to bed!' she cried. 'Hup, there'.7 (pp. 172-73). If, to revert briefly to Georg Lukacs, God's abandonment of the world, negatively considered, has left that world in a state of "meaninglessness", more positively it has created the conditions for total freedom, the given opportunity to create in that neutral space one's own happiness. If the world is indeed neutral, it need not be a blank; neutrality ? the suspension of moral inhibition ? may yield an amoral innocence that is continuous with that neutrality. 7. I am aware that the sexual act is not always unambiguously treated: at the end of Section 1, for example, Sheila is to submit to Tom's sexual advances "like a victim on a block*' (p. 139). But I would prefer to regard any negative suggestion here as proleptic or anticipative ? "ominous" ? the textual disturbance alerting us to the possibility that Sheila is, after all, fated to suffer. 68</page><page sequence="11">PRICE OF FREEDOM Yet the notorious fact ? and the one that gives rise to the major interpretative crux in The Doctor's Wife ? is that Sheila's happiness does not last. Even in the scene from which I have just quoted, the innocent play of the lovers is immediately followed by a sense of ominous intrusion; The door bell rang. He stopped, skidding in the centre of the hall. 'The concierge?' she whispered. (p. 173) It is, in fact, Sheila's brother Owen, who, though he fails to gain admission, pushes a note under the door. It would be extravagant or indeed inaccurate to refer the ringing doorbell to nemesis; but the sense strongly conveyed is that the lovers have been found out by what Sheila has earlier termed "the world, their enemy" (p.l 16). The interpretative crux I have referred to turns on the question as to why the affair between Tom and Sheila finally fails, or, more specifically, why Sheila fails to board the plane that would take her to a permanent relationship with Tom in America. The Yugoslav Ivo tells Owen, aphoristically, that "Falling in love is a crime usually committed by innocent people. So they rarely get away with it" (p. 188). But this is simply a formulation of the problem, not an explanation of it. Why should the innocent not "get away with it?" Or, to move more closely to the problem and the terms Sheila herself uses to express it, what lies behind her late recognition, as conveyed to Owen, that she must "pay for" what has happened? ' . . .Most of the time I feel very happy . . . But the other night I woke up feeling suicidal. I think I know why. It was because I was unwilling to face up to what has happened me. I was still looking for some way out. Some way I could go on feeling like this but not having to pay for it. Now I know that's not possible. I'll have to pay. I've accepted that'. (p.181) The facile and unimaginative answer is that Sheila here simply acknowledges her "responsibilities" to others, specifically her husband and son: if she fails to live up to those responsibilities, then a sense of guilt will be inevitable. That guilt would be the price exacted for her affair with Tom. But this assumes that she has already committed herself to Tom and is indeed ready finally to maintain that commitment: whereas the outcome is precisely the opposite. Why, then, does she not board the plane and fly to America and to re-union with Tom? She herself is never to specify the reason, and hence the 69</page><page sequence="12">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW element of "indeterminacy" that characterizes the novel's ending. This is one of her late exchanges with the priest in Notre-Dame: T was supposed to go to America. But I didn't because . . ,' She did not finish, but he was accustomed to these things. He knew to wait. T couldn't', she said at last. (p.251) Perhaps an adequate explanation can be found if we give due emphasis to the scene in which she is raped by her own husband (pp.239-41). If we assume that Tom and Sheila have, in their innocent total eroticism, created or re-created a kind of innocent happiness in that neutral "space" I spoke of earlier, then Kevin's rape of Sheila represents a brutal violation or defilement of that space, a destructive intrusion into what had, in its own way, been sacrosanct. This is the most cruel and definitive assault by "the world", by reality, on the vulnerable alternative world created by the lovers. But the reason for Sheila's final choice seems frankly to lie much deeper than that, and remains elusive. At one point, shortly before the rape-scene, Tom responds to Sheila's reluctance to follow out their original plan and accuses her of "fear of flying". And indeed we have already been informed of Sheila's "fear" in the narration: I am going to America. I am starting my life over again. But as she said these words to herself, she found it hard to imagine what the new life would be like. And, again, she was afraid. (p-234) Once more, it would seem to me an oversimplification, on the basis of this one sequence, to summarize Sheila's motive as "fear of the unknown", or even to accuse her of inhibition or timidity. When, early on, she seizes on the intimation that "The future is forbidden to no one", she immediately adds: "Unless we forbid it to ourselves" (p.49). But if Sheila accepts some such self-imposed prohibition, it is not simply out of fear; or, if it be the case that fear is the issue, fear itself is merely a symptom of an intuition so deeply felt that it eludes formulation. The intuition is a familiar tragic one, and seems trite once we put it into words: it is the inability to believe in human happiness. This is the tragic reality to which Moore conducts his female fantasist: it is not nemesis (retribution for wrong-doing), but Fate (as necessity, Freud's ananke) which determines the novel's ending. Neither Sheila Redden nor Moore have sufficient faith in the pleasure-principle; the reality-principle (as Freud felt it always must) wins out, and Sheila's only immediately evident prize is a hint of a new maturity ("Something had changed", it seems to Owen at their final meenng in London. "He 70 *</page><page sequence="13">PRICE OF FREEDOM could not say, exactly, but she looked older" : p.272). We may, if we choose, accuse (a pessimistic) Moore of complicity in this negative ending: it is finally his own belief in the impossibility of happiness that decides the outcome. But if there be complicity, it is a complicity in which we the readers (and perhaps the normative whole of Western culture) is also involved. Our total engagement with the wonderful concluding pages is itself ample evidence of that complicity. There is some degree of accuracy in Tom's accusation of "fear of flying": Sheila does not finally accept the possibility of "upward" soaring to freedom and fulfilment (with, perhaps, the additional sexual connotations Freud associated with flying); perhaps, like Joyce, Moore is too familiar with the myth of Icarus. But the important point remains that Sheila is, at last, still free: if not free to fly then free to fall. And if she may be accused of "fear of flying", then "fear of falling" is something that she has overcome. When, in the course of the novel, she and Tom take an elevator to the top of the Arc de Triomphe, Sheila leans so far out that she alarms Tom. "Aren't you scared of heights?", he asks. Her reply is: "I used to be. Terribly" (p.200). Later she experiences a crucial metaphorical fall: "Suddenly, inexplicably, she felt herself tumble from the mental tightrope on which she had balanced for the last two weeks" (p.229). This is the tragic direction her freedom is to take: real freedom, but at the cost of almost everything. In the case of Judith Hearne, I noted in that novel her feeling, "I'm free. I'm ? falling" (p. 153); but Judith is spared the full consequences of her fall (and indeed the fact that she fails to open the tabernacle door and find a possible void therein may mean that she is spared the worst). The major distinction between her fate and Sheila Redden's is that the doctor's wife is not so spared. If, at the close, she has totally overcome her fear of falling it is because, in reaching rock-bottom, she has no further to fall: [Owen] had been waiting for her to turn, to wave, to give one last look back. But she left him as she had left all the rest, Danny, Kevin, home. No look back. (P-275) Sheila is finally free, but at the cost of almost total dispossession. Like "an ordinary woman on her way to the corner to buy cigarettes" (p.277), she walks out of the park, out of her previous existence, and, the pained heart of the reader impotent to arrest her movement, out of the novel and into limbo. Even more so than in Judith Hearne, the norm in The Doctor's Wife is the purely secular: the concept "God" is more severely marginalized. "God", however, does appear even here, as a possibility that Sheila (and her family) have long ago rejected: "She had thought 'God'. The 71</page><page sequence="14">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW word usually came to her lips these days as a meaningless ejaculation" (p. 100). When, seeking counsel in her dilemma, she goes to the priest in Notre-Dame, she is unable, as she tells him, to think that "God is here" (p. 161); even in the great cathedral, Sheila is aware only of the Real Absence. "No, God is not here. Notre-Dame is a museum, its pieties are in the past" (p. 162). Since Sheila does not believe in God (in spite of her ambiguous recourse to the priest), her only authentic alternative is that, in her total freedom, she should come into the "desolation of reality" (Yeats's phrase in "Meru"). The logic implicit in the development of The Doctor*s Wife points to the same conclusion as that conveyed by Judith Hearne: as I stated earlier, Moore can finally envisage no middle way between "immanent meaninglessness" and the recovery of God. Unable to believe in a God, the idea of which is "ridiculous" (p.253), Sheila Redden falls into a limbo in which a painful freedom is possible only because all immanent significance ? and with that all absolutes and imperatives outside the self ? has faded away. So both Sheila Redden and her creator put aside all "sentimental weakness" in a movement towards authentic being that Nietzsche might have understood. All of this suggests a certain rigour in Moore's thinking, whereby no sentimental substitute for the ur-grund of significance we call "God" is to be permitted. And this brings us back, in fact, to the question of Moore's "naturalist" aesthetic. If the world cannot be redeemed from its immanent meaninglessness by a genuine divinity, then there is nothing to validate myth or symbol apart from the merely human wish that things should, after all, signify. Moore's stringent naturalism is a token of his refusal to yield to the sentimentalism of that wish: his writings can find no place for what Robert Frost called "the pleasure of ulteriority". The exclusion of that pleasure in Moore's naturalistic mode is well-nigh absolute: he avoids equally the network of significant motif found in Joyce (especially in Ulysses), and the "crypto allegorical" procedures of Kafka or Beckett. Naturalism suggests, and traditionally has done, a bleak and empty universe. But in the case of The Doctor*s Wife there is one final, teasing "indeterminacy". If Sheila dismisses "God" because the idea is "ridiculous", the priest in Notre-Dame accepts the idea, it appears, for that very reason: 'I know', the priest said. 'It doesn't make sense. But believing in God is like being in love. You don't have to have reasons, or proofs, or justifications. You are in love, voila tout. You know it'. The woman began to weep. (pp.253-54) 72</page><page sequence="15">PRICE OF FREEDOM If the world is absurd, and the idea of God is ridiculous, then perhaps some restoration of contact between the two is possible. More importantly, Sheila Redden is here absorbed into a nexus of love and suffering that is beyond utterance. If the God of Christian tradition exists, she is thereby brought closer to this God, situated as he may be at the heart of that mysterious nexus. The weeping woman here is not quite a Magdalen, but she has both loved and suffered much, and remains significantly alive in her limbo. 73</page></plain_text>
