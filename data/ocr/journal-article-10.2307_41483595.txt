<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEWS NATIONAL MUSEUM DIRECTOR TO RETIRE Dr Patrick Wallace has been the longest-serving head of any Irish cultural institution As we go to press, the Director of the National Museum of Ireland, Dr Patrick Wallace, will have spent his last day as head of one of our most culturally significant institutions. Dr Wallace, who initially made his mark as the excavator of the Viking and medieval remains at Wood Quay, has spent more than 40 years as a member of the museum's staff and for 24 of those years he has held the post of Director, since his appointment in 1 988. He has been the longest-serving head of any Irish cultural institution. In that time it is generally accepted that he has overseen the transformation of the museum from an inward-looking, fusty and academically focused organisation to a much more user-friendly, visitor-centred one. In addition, he was instrumental in the opening of the Decorative Arts and History extension at Collins Barracks and the Museum of Country Life at Turlough Park in Castlebar. The museum's four sites chalked up the best part of 1 .1 million visitors in 201 1, an increase of more than 20% on 2009 - a terrific achievement in a period of declining Irish tourism. In interviews given to the Irish Times and RTÉ when he announced his retirement, he cited government neglect, staff cutbacks, large budget reductions and his own exhaustion with taking on the system for his decision. He claimed that the crude rules of staff reductions and pension changes amounted to nothing more than an incitement to leave. When Archaeology Ireland spoke to him a couple of weeks before he was due to leave, we asked what he felt now about his decision to retire. He responded: 'I genuinely wish the museum and its staff, for whom I have the height of respect, all the best for the future'. He went on, however, to say: 'I worry that if the proposed cutbacks are implemented the place will come to a standstill. Around 30 people are due to leave in 201 2 and 201 3, and staff numbers are already at a minimum. We have also acquired a much-needed, new state-of-the-art location for storage and back-office operations in Swords, but staff are reluctant to move there and with the proposed lower staff numbers it is difficult to see how it can operate.' In an interview with Archaeology Ireland in 1 989 just after Dr Wallace was appointed, he was asked the reasons for his appointment. One of the answers given was 'to heighten the profile and status of the National Museum in public perception'. Has he achieved this? 'Yes. Absolutely. Everyone you meet, from taxi drivers to the man in the street, has a high degree of awareness about the museum, because of my deliberate policy of speaking to the media about our activities. That has been the easy part, compared to the torture of meetings, budgets and the management of people, for which the public service ill-prepares you.' 'In truth,' he continued, 'I should have moved on ten years ago when all my best work was complete, but there is no opportunity for a career progression, or any thought put into how best to use the experience of people like me in a different role and allow younger people to take over the main management role.' And what does he plan to do now in his retirement? 'Continue the publication of the Dublin excavations, write a book on transport before the Famine and one on my native Askeaton, Co. Limerick. I am also available for consultancy and broadcasting work,' he added with a smile. There is no doubt that Pat Wallace will be missed for his outspokenness and for his willingness to engage with the world outside the museum. ■ Launch of Breaking Ground , Finding Craves Pictured at the launch of Breaking, Ground Finding Graves on 28 February 2012, from left to right: Maeve Sikora (editor), John O'Mahony (Chairman of the Board of the National Museum), Patrick F.

Cork, revealed a large and curiously shaped stone. Some of the district's older inhabitants recall that it was known as Tete Micheál's god', an artefact registered in local folklore but which had slipped from view in the past couple of decades. It is a fascinating and probably revealing moniker for a stone that might well have been carved in ancient times. The artefact is 51cm high, 20cm wide at the top, 15cm wide at its narrowest and 36cm wide at the bottom. Viewed in its present position from the south-east (Fig. 1), the stone has a markedly anthropomorphic appearance: the top appears head-like, the middle has two convex bands running like short arms from the sides to the centre, and the base has similar if less well-defined bands suggestive of folded legs. The shape of the sculpture reminds us of the iconic stone carvings of human forms that are found in Ireland, Britain and continental Europe and are generally believed to belong to the pagan 'Celtic' Iron Age period. As Étienne Rynne (1972) pointed out in a widely read paper, there is a major concentration of these carvings in Ulster, although stone heads of the same probable date are scattered across Ulster, Leinster and Munster. The putative figure at Billeragh may be very crude in character when compared with the best-preserved idols from Ulster, but it seems to share its squatting posture with the idol from the ancient graveyard on Lustymore Island, Co. Fermanagh. The 'Celtic' stone idols have typically been found in ancient church and burial sites. The well-known concentration on Cathedral Hill, Armagh, is located on what was an important pagan sanctuary and the site chosen by St Patrick to build his principal church. It may be relevant that the Beara figure is located in the vicinity of the Ballaghboy (local name: Ballaughbee) burial ground, which, as evidenced by its prominent curved enclosure, seems to be of early origin. Indeed, there is a hint of an inscribed cross on the face of the head. We may, of course, be looking at the carving from the wrong side. It is the distinctly bulbous 'head' that catches the eye when the stone is viewed in its present position from the north-west (Fig. 2). We are reminded here of the phallic stones of the pre-Christian Iron Age, such as are found at Tara (where the example is still popularly described as the 'Lia Fáil') and Dún Dealgan (the great mound outside Dundalk, Co. Louth), as well as at Kilkieran, Co. Kilkenny, Killadeas, Co. Fermanagh, and- most relevant in this context, perhaps - Clear Island, Co. Cork. The Beara figure appears to have been carved from an oval boulder, as was a famous stone head on the Dingle Peninsula, in the adjoining county of Left: Fig. 1 - The stone from the south-east. Above right: Fig. 2 - The stone from the north-west. Kerry, which is known locally as the head of Crom Dubh, reputedly a pagan chieftain or god of the harvest, worshipped in prehistoric times. This particular head is associated with the annual pilgrimage to Mount Brandon and is regarded as being connected with the pagan festival of Lughnasa. The carving seems to have been removed in the last ten or twenty years. In summary, we cannot say for certain what 'Pete Micheál's god' was, or how old it is, or indeed how it came into the possession of the late Pete McCarthy, on whose property it has been located in recent decades. Nonetheless, the folkloric recollection of this crudely carved stone as a 'god' - an idol - must carry some interpretative weight, as must its remote find-spot at the very edge of the land, facing onto the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean. ■ Liam Downey, Connie Murphy and Tadhg O'Keeffe Reference Rynne, E. 1972 Celtic stone idols in Ireland.
