<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ORIENTrAL SOCIETY. The Jleterodoxies of the Shiites fin the Presentation of lbn Hazm.-By ISRAEL FRIEDLAENDER, Professor in the Jewish Theological Seminary, New York City. COMMENTARY.1 THE Commentary herewith presented follows Ibn Hazm's text published in Vol. xxviii of this Journal, pp. 28-80, by page and line. In marking the lines, I have counted every line on the page, including the superscriptions. The footnotes are not quoted by the line but by the number prefixed to them. In the case of some very long footnotes, I also added the line of the footnote referred to. I prefix a "List of Cited Works," giving all the authorities (with short biographical dates) regularly or frequently quoted in this treatise. The abbreviations under which they are quoted are made noticeable to the eve.2 Books only incidentally referred to are omitted in this list. MS. before the title signi- fies that the book has not yet appeared in print and has been used in manuscript. In quoting from Arabic sources I have discriminated between printed works and manuscripts. The latter I quote in the original; the former I give-except in cases of necessity-in ' Continued from Vol. xxviii, pp. 1-80. 2 To simplify the abbreviations, I purposely neglect the rules of exact transliteration.</page><page sequence="2">2 I.

In translating from the printed edition of Ibn Hazm's Jilal, I usually attach the important variants from the manuscripts at my disposal. I plead guilty to being inconsistent in transliterating the Arabic. Such inconsistencies are scarcely avoidable. The specialist will pardon them, the layman will hardly notice them.

The date given in the text is based on the following calcula- tions. al-Kashshi was a pupil of al-'AyyAshi (edition of his work, p. 379). The latter is no doubt identical with Fihrist 195'4, and Tusy, List of Shy'ah books, No. 690. Neither of these authors give his age. But according to Tusy, ib., al-'Ayyhshb " heard the disciples (ash4b) of 'All b. al-Hasan b. Fa4a'l " who died 224" (Tusy, No. 191).

The devout philoso- pher was revered as a saint" (Dozy, Isi. 255). It is highly characteristic that Makrizi, who quotes this passage almost verbatim (:34516)3, omits al-Ash lar's name both here and 1. 17. 25 Although himself a Zahirite like Ibn Hazm,4 he did not possess his courage or consistency to charge the patron-saint of the Sunna with heterodox views. The same consideration probably accounts for the variant in L and Y (see note 6). The printer of Ed. repeatedly endeavors to defend al-Ash'ari againist the 30 attacks of our author.

"exaggerated"= [33] C, This verb, which in the form of the participle (AL.JU or ~kr) has become the technical term for the Ultra-Shi'a, origin- ally seems to have had a wider range and to have been applied to other than Shiitic movements. Thus Ikd (249) has a special 10 chapter on " guluww" in asceticism. Makrlzi applies this expression to all sects of Islam and states in the case of each sect the nature of its "guluww," i. e., in how far it exaggerates the correct principles of the Sunna. - L. 24. This view is held by Ab-f Isma'f1 al-Bittikhf (p. 3), Ed. IV, 1899. L. 26. This view is held by the Meimllniyya, a section of the 'Ajarida, Ed. IV, 190", Shahr. 96, Bagd. 4b.

The doctrine of Metempsychosis was current among the Mu'tazilites, Schreiner, der Kalam in der jidischen Litteratur, p. 62 ff.

These heretics maintain "'that all the religious precepts have an inner meaning, and that Allah has imposed upon his 15 saints and those that have perceived the Imams and the " Gates " (abwab, sftfitic term) neither prayer nor alms nor anything else." Makr. 35218 quotes in the name of the Khattabiyya (Text 69) the same specimens of allegorical interpretation, with a few characteristic modifications. Thus " Jibt " and "Tag-ft" 20 (1. 7) are interpreted as referring to Ab-f Sufyan and 'Amr b. al-'As, while Ab-f Bekr and 'Omar are represented by "khamr" (wine) and " maysir " (a gambling game), Koran 2, 216; 5, 92. This is no doubt an attempt to soften somewhat the insult to "the two Sheikhs" implied in the original interpretation. 25 Interesting, because reflecting the attitude of official Shiism toward these exegetic endeavors, are the two anecdotes told Kashi 188. "Ab-f 'Abdallah (i. e., Ja'far as-Sadik, see Index) wrote to Ab1f'l-Khattab (Text 694): 'It has come to my knowl- edge that thou assumest that " adultery " means a person, that 30 "wine," "prayer," "fasts" and "abominations" (fawahish, Koran 6, 152; 7, 31) mean certain persons. It is not as thou sayest.'-Someone said to Ja'far: 'It is reported in thy name that "wine," "maysir," images, " and 'arrows" (Koran 5, 92) stand for certain persons.'

He then pro- [35] ceeds to refute Jahm and Abf'l-Hudeil. As for the Rawafid, they deserve no refutation, as they do not rely on logical demon- stration (the last sentence missing in Ed.). In another passage (Ed. II, 94) I. H. elaborately argues against those of his co- 5 religionists who "take it for granted that religion cannot be accepted on the basis of logical demonstration, thus gladdening the hearts of the heretics and testifying that religion can be established by means of assumptions and by superior force." How deeply seated this aversion to argumentation was in Shi- 1o itic circles can be seen from the utterances of the famous Imamite Ibn Bab-fye (I'tikadat 6b), who devotes a whole chapter to this subject.

Makr. 3624 if. reproduces our passage without giving is credit to its author (comp. p. 8, n. 3). Ibn Hazm's view on the origin of Shiitic heterodoxy is founded on the observation of the role played by the Persian element in the Shiitic movement, a view fully shared and frequently over-emphasized by modern scholars (see Introduction, p. 3, note 1). This view, which conveniently 20 enough regards the introduction of "I uluww " (see p. 12b) into Islam as a treacherous act of revenge' on the part of the subju- gated nationalities, is voiced also by other Muhammedan writers, comp., e. g., the utterance of Ibn al-Athir VIII, 21 (p. 1410) and Iji 349. I. H. gives repeated expression to this conviction 25in his Alilal, comparing the treachery of the Persians with the deceitful attitude of the Jews towards Christianity, the latter having bribed the apostle Paul to smuggle the doctrine of "guluww" into the new faith.' Thus in the chapter dealing with Christianity (Ed. II, 38) I. H. endeavors to prove that the 30 Apostles were infidels.

Next to the Persians, the largest share in the importation of heterodox doctrines into Islam is attributed to the Jews, mainly on the ground that 'Abdallah b. Saba (p. 1836 iff.), the founder of the first Shiitic sect, is said to have been a Jew. Thus I. H.., 15 in referring to the claim of the Jews regarding the apostle Paul,4 thoughtfully adds (I, 222): "This is something which we do not consider improbable on their part. For they tried the same thing towards ourselves and our religion, although this time they failed to carry out their cunning. I refer to 'Abdallah b. 20 Saba known as Ibn as-Sauda, the Jew, the Himyarite-may Allah curse him!-who embraced Islam in order to lead into error as many Muslims as possible. He assumed the leadership of an ignoble party, who stood on the side of Ali, so that they might profess the divinity of Ali, in the same way as Paul 25 became the leader' of the followers of Christ that they might believe his divinity.

He is generally considered the founder of Shi- ism, and this, in connection with his Jewish origin, sufficiently explains the endeavors of the Muhammedan theologians to charge him with many a heresy which developed in the later course of Shiism. His Jewish birth was a sufficient pretext for 10 the Sunnites to bring Shiism in connection with Judaism. We saw Ibn Hazm's remarks p. 16 f. Kashi, in the biography of 'Abdallah b. Saba, p. 70, plainly says: "On account of this the opponents of the Shi'a maintain that the root of Shiism and Rafidism (L)uJ FUJ, see Appendix on Rawafid) was taken 15 over from Judaism." The famous theologian ash-Sha'bl (died 103) is reported to have drawn an elaborate and odious parallel between the Shiites and the Jews (Ikd 269). He says among other things, with special reference to Ibn Saba: "The Rafida are the Jews of this nation. They hate Islam as the Jews hate 20 Christianity. They embraced Islam, not because they longed for it or because they feared Allah, but because they detested the Muslims and intended to overpower them."

The founder of the Jar-fdiyya is called with his full [43] name Ab-'l-Jarifd Ziyad b. al-Mundir al-'Abdi, Masudi V, 474, Kashi 150, Tusy, p. 146 No. 308, Shahr. 121; Fihr. 17812 and Makr. 35224 assign to him the additional Kunya Ab-f 'n-Najm. Muhammed al-BAkir (died 117) called him "SurhAb," which is 1o said to designate "a blind devil dwelling in the sea" (Kashi, Shahr. 119), because he was born blind (Fihr., Kashi, Tusy). The sect was accordingly called also the Surhtlbiyya (Kashi). As regards their tenets, the Jar-idiyya variously differ from the bulk of the Zeidiyya, whom they regard as infidels. They share i5 with the latter the central doctrine that Muhammed appointed Ali as his successor, not, as the Imamiyya maintain, by means of a written will which the Companions maliciously set aside, but " by a description (of his qualities) without the mention of his name" (Shahr.: XeM. &lt;9 &gt; i)JL). But they differ 20 from them in that they regard the Companions as infidels because they did not endeavor to find out the man to whom the Prophet referred and chose a wrong one in his place. Accord- ing to Shahr. 118, Abft'l-Jarftd went so far as even to deny the Imamate of Zeid b. Ali, the founder of the Zeidiyya, on the 2s5ground that the latter considered AbU Bekr and 'Omar legi- timate rulers. Isfr., however, (9a ult.) insists that the recogni- tion of Zeid as Imam is common to all Zeiditic sects without exception. It is strange that I. H. should omit the mention of this typical heterodoxy of the Jarftdiyya: the " Takfir as- 30 Sahaba." As to the succession in the Imamate, the Jarftdiyya agree with the rest of the Zeidiyya that it is legitimate in the descend- ants both of Hasan and Husein, and in these exclusively, on condition that they are qualified for. the Imamate and present 35 their claims with the sword in their hands. Of the three Imams quoted in our passage one is a Hasanide, the other two Huseinides.

Bagd. 17b calls the locality L x (with soft C under the line) See further Text 6010 and Comm. - L. 7-8. The belief that the Imams have not died and will reappear on earth is the central tenet of the Ultra-Shi'a, and lo occurs, as can be seen in this treatise, in connection with nearly every one of their sects. This belief is founded on two doctrines which must have gained wide currency in heterodox Islam at a very early period: the one is the Raj 'a doctrine, the other is a doctrine derived from heterodox Christian Docetism. It is 15 necessary to gain a clear view of these two doctrines in order to grasp in its full meaning the conception which practically lies at the bottom of all Shiitic movements. The doctrine designated as JRaj'a' has apparently had its history and presents in consequence a complex appearance. 20 Kremer (culturgeschichte unter den Chalifen II, 397), in speak- ing of this doctrine " which was widely current among the Shi- ites of the earliest period," gives the following definition of this belief: "For a man to believe in the ' Return' (Raj 'a) amounted to the conviction that Ali would rise from the dead, 25 and that he himself would, after a certain period of time (as a rule, after forty days), come to life again." According to the national dictionaries, Raj 'a. signifies "the returning to the present state of existence after death, before the Day of Resur- rection." (See Lane, sub voce, and the authorities quoted 30 there.) It would thus appear that this belief in returning to life after death, which was known to the Arabs as early as in the time of Ignorance (Lane, ib.) applied to people in general, without reference to specific personalities. Jabir b. Yazid al- Ju'fi (died 128, see p. 86") believed in the Raj'a, Muslim, 3 Sa^hi (Cairo 1283) I, 51.

Kuthayyir (died 105) expressed on his death-bed the conviction that he would return to life after forty days on a lofine horse (Agh.

We find this belief repeatedly in connection with Muhammed. When Muhammed 15 had died, 'Omar violently rebuked those who believed that the Prophet was dead, and he gave emphatic expression to his belief that he would " return" after forty days, "just as Moses had done," Tab. I, 1815 f., IBab., Ithbat 31, Bagd. 5Er (here Muham- med. is compared with Jesus). 'Abdallah b. Saba, the founder 20 of Shiism (p. 18 f.), is said to have believed in the " Return " of Muhammed. Referring to Koran 28, 85,2 he argued: "It is strange that people who assert that Jesus will return should deny that Muhammed will return, . . . Muhammed beini g worthier of returning than Jesus." "And he laid down for 25them the Raj'a." Tab. I 2941. As a rule, the Raj'a belief is found in connection with the Ima'ms of the Shi'a, in the first place, of course, with Ali. The 1 This form of Raj'a is probably the real basis of the belief current among the Khattabiyya that they will never die (p. 7229).-An allusion to this belief is perhaps found Agh.

Saba, who maintained that Ali had not died and would return on earth." To the references given in the course of this treatise (see p. 42 f.) may also be added Madainl (died about 225/840), who reports that al-Hasan, the son of Ali, pro- tested against the belief that God would bring Ali to life on 15 earth before the day of Resurrection (ZDMG. 38, 391). How deeply rooted this belief was in the masses may be seen from the curious anecdote narrated by 'Abdallah b. 'Abbas (Ikd 269). A man called on him at a very unusual hour and asked him: "When will this man be brought to life?" W"Which20 man?"- " Ali b. AbM TAUib.' I said: "He will not be brought to life, until God brings to life those that are in the graves." He said: " You speak like one of these fools." I said: "Take him away from me, may Allah curse him!" Next to Ali the Raj 'a occurs in connection with his son 25 Mrhammed b. al-Hanafiyya. It was the belief of the Keisa- niyya, and its famous champions were the poets Kuthayyir and as-Sayyid al-Himyari, Agh.

In the later development of the Shi'a we find the Raj'a belief in connection with nearly every Shiitic Imam. Numerous 5instances can be gleaned from Ibn Hazm's. and Shahrastani's accounts on Shiism. It was the salient feature in the contro- versies of the Shi'a and the belief which characterized the Wakifiyya in distinction from the Kittl'iyya (p. 50). It now remains for us to state the relation of the Raj 'a doc- 1o trine to the belief in the Transmigration of Souls (Tanasukh al- Arwaih). This relation is perhaps best illustrated by the amus- ing anecdote (told of as-Sayyid al-Himyari, who believed in Raj'a as well as in Tanasukh, 1. 26 f. and p. 2820). A man asked as-Sayyid for a loan of a hundred dinArs, promising to repay 15 them when he (the debtor) should return to life. As-Sayyid answered: "Yes, and even more than that, if you will give me a guarantee that you will return as a man." He said: "How else can I return"'? as-Sayyid said: " I am afraid that you will return as a dog or as a pig, and my money will be lost." (Agh. 20 VII, 8. See the same anecdote with a few variations Fawdt al- Wafayat I, 25). The former possibility is Raj'a, the latter Tanasukh; in other words, Raj'a signifies the return as the same person, Tanasukh the return as a different being. The two con- ceptions, though related to one another and, in consequence, 25 often found side by side, are by no means identical and are dis- tinctly kept asunder. Kuthayyir, as well as as-Sayyid, believed not only in Raj'a but also in Tanasukh (Agh. VIII, 277; he claims to be the Prophet Jona, ib. 34). But it is expressly stated that he believed " in Raj'a and Tanasukh " (Agh. VIII, 30277). In the same way both expressions are found side by side Shahr. 12513, 13212. Makr. (3549), who enumerates a sect of Raj'iyya (see above), mentions in the same passage klj u2J i"U-i IC l ;; 05.JUW1. Ibn Babtye, who staunchly defends Raj'a,1 violently rejects Tanasukh (see p. 75').

The same close contact between 5 the two conceptions is apparently assumed, ib. II, 169.' Makr. 357' contradicts his own previous statements when he says: "From him (i. e., 'Abdallah b. Saba) they also took over the belief in the conceallhent2 of the Imam and the belief in his return after death on earth, in the same way as the Imamiyya lo till this day believe it of " the man of the cellar," and this is the belief in Tand'sukh al-Arwalh." Apart from these instances, which are otherwise not very striking, the two ideas are clearly separated from one another.4 sible for this attitude of Ibn Babfiye: J~is itJI WEAN 4 y &amp;'-.&gt;i ' Yoi- 4~ t 3s~ ~ ~*4~N ~, ~*4~L~ 3 JL~A, ,J 1 The Prophet says to Ali: "Thou art its (this nation's) Du'l-Karnein (Alexander the Great)."

His contention, however, practi- cally rests on a single passage (Agh-. VIII, 34) which, even if taken in Wellhausen's interpretation, cannot stand against the numerous pas- sages to the contrary. But the passage in question does not necessarily prove Wellhausen's assertion. We are told that Kuthayyir used to give money to the little sons of Hasan b. Hasan (b. Ali; not, as Wellhausen erroneously has it, "IHasan and Husein ") and to call them " little prophets": x H ts, (similarly on the same page before).

[43] It can be seen from the preceding expositions that Raj'a as such leaves the question open whether the Imam had really died, or whether he had merely disappeared and abides in concealment pending his reappearance. On the strength of the instances 5 quoted above one is inclined to assume that the former belief is the original one, while the latter is the later but the more popular one. It is in this form-as a correlative of "gaiba" (" con- cealment" of the Imam) -that Raj 'a became a predominant factor in Shiism and still is the official belief of the Shiites of 10 today.' action, which can only have been the outcome of his belief in the Trans- migration of Souls, and that consequently the two beliefs are identical. That Kutbayyir was an adept of Metempsychosis is repeatedly stated in Agh. (see in the text above). But the construction put on the explanatory words is not irrefutable. On the same page a similar action of Kuthayyir (he hugs Mu'Awiya b. 'Abdallah b. Ja'far (see p. 45), who was a schoolboy at the time, and calls him a little prophet) is recorded without the explanation appended here. The words ; a.JU 0 may signify here as little as in the statement regarding as-Sayyid (Agh. VII, 2418) iL ; ;4t v In both cases the explanatory remark may simply mean to imply that the man in question was an abominable heretic, the belief in Raj'a being regarded as a sign of extreme heterodoxy (comp. Agh. III, 249). At any rate, the weight of the passage referred to by Wellhausen is largely counterbalanced by the statement, Agh VIII, 277, that Kuthayyir believed in " Raj'a and Tantsukh," where the two ideas appear as dis- tinctly different. 1 By way of appendix a few isolated usages of the term Raj'a may find place here. Extremely interesting, but somewhat obscure, is the passage Agh. III, 188. Omayya b. Abi Salt, who is anxious to become a prophet, goes to Syria and repeatedly enters a church, while his com- panions have to wait outside. A monk who lives in that church had told him that there were to be six Raj'dt (see the remark on the margin of Agh.) after Jesus, of which five had already come to pass. When he comes another time, he is told by the monk: " The Raj'a has already come and a prophet has been sent from among the Arabs." Thereupon he gives up his prophetic ambitions.-A very peculiar interpretation of the Raj'a belief is found Mirza 46b, but, in view of the polemical tend- ency of his treatise, this interpretation may only reflect his own indi- vidual conception of the Shiitic doctrine. He says: ;;y O ) Jr xX L * l tF J</page><page sequence="29">Vol. xxix.] The Jieterodoxies of the Shiites, etc. 29 This conception, which regards the death of the Imams as a L43] mere disappearance, indispensably needs a complement which should account for the fact of their apparent death, the more so as the Imams of the Shi'a, with scarcely any exception, all died an unnatural death. This complement is supplied by a s heterodox Christian doctrine borrowed from Docetism.' It can- not be our task here to trace the influence of Docetism on Islam. But it seems highly probable that this doctrine came to the Muslims through the medium of Manichaeism, which adopted this belief and gave it a definite shape. "The Jesus of the lo Manichaeans then had no objective reality as man. His whole human appearance, birth and baptism were a mere apparition, and so were his sufferings. For it was not he who was really crucified, but it was an emissary of the devil who tried to frus- trate the instructive activity of Jesus, and who, as a punish- 15 ment for his wickedness, was fastened to the cross by Jesus himself" (Kessler, Article "IManichaer," PRE3, XII, 218.

The passage referred to proves nothing of the kind. It merely says G Ls a 1 )'I tA f which has nothing to do with the term Raj'a.

[43] This docetic belief, which afforded a satisfactory explanation of the alleged death of the Shiitic Imams, was readily adopted by the radical Shiites, and it often occurs in the very same form which Manichaeism had given it: that not the Imam was really 5 killed, but a devil who assumed his shape (9)-? );. ;)L4.). We find this belief in connection with nearly every Imam of the Ultra-Shiites. On its application to Ali, which is undoubtedly historical, see p. 43 f. Bagd. and Isfr. mention this theory in connection with the following Imams: Ali (in the name of 1o 'Abdallah b. Saba) Bagd. 94a, Isfr. 55b f.; AbA Muslim (see Index), Bagd. 100a, Isfr. 59a; Muhammed b. 'Abdallah b. al- Hasan b. al-Hasan (p. 87), Bagd. 18a f., 97a; lallaj (Text 6918), who is said to have stamped his features on someone else, Bagd. 102a, Isfr. 61b. The Imamites who believe in the " return " of the 15 twelfth Imam, the only one who was not murdered (at least according to the Imamitic belief), and therefore insist that the preceding Imams are really dead, have no room for this belief. But it can be seen from the polemics of Ibn Babftye that this docetic belief was widespread in Shiitic circles. After having 20 described the manner of (violent) death of the eleven Imams- a favorite topic in Imamitic works-IBab. thus sums up his position (1'tikadat 23b, in the chapter d-y.xJt iJ ) 25X42z)@-ad S&amp;x Loz&gt;4u)0 Lai ~'L (read W) U at Usdj J J This docetic belief, in conjunction with the Raj'a doctrine, enabled the Ultra-Shiites to assume a position which made them 30 practically invincible. The former made their Imams invulner- able: they were immune from death or murder. The latter made them immortal and carried over their living influence to posterity.

According to Masudi [44] (VII, 117), there were many Zeidites at the time he was writ- ing his history (332h) who believed in the "return" (Raj 'a) of Muhammed. His followers were especially numerous in Kufa, Tabaristan and Deilam. 5 L. 6 ff. Ibn Hazm's references to the Keisdniyya, which are frequent, though brief, substantially enrich our knowledge of this important sect. This at once shows itself in the explana- tion of the name, which is the only correct one among the numerous interpretations offered by other writers. The con-lo ventional explanation derives the name from Keisan, which is declared to have been a nickname of Mukhtar (p. 7917), so the Dictionaries: fTauhari (comp. IKhall. No. 570), m4ds, Lisdrn and Tf~j al-'Ards, sub voce OULAS; IKot. 300, Ikd 2696, Makr. 351- (=de Sacy II, 592), Bagd. llb. On the other15 hand, endeavors were made to connect the founder of this sect in some way with Ali, or with his son Muhamirned b. al-Hanafiyya, whom the Keisaniyya regard as his successor and the heir of his mystic knowledge (a point on which this sect lays great stress). As there was a maula of Ali named Keisan (he falls, 20 while defending his master, in the battle of Siffin, Tab. I, 3293 =IAth. III, 247), he was declared the founder of the Keisa- niyya and the disciple of Ali, or of Muhammed b. al-Hanafiyya, in the lore of mysticism, see Shahr. (who distinguishes between the Keisaniyya and the Mukhtariyya), similarly Abu'l-Maali 25 157, IKhall. ib. (who also quotes the preceding explanation, with the confession pal "JJ1), IKhald. I, 357,1 Makr. ib., Kremer, Ideen 375. An attempt to reconcile both derivations is the interpretation quoted by Bagd. (iib) " that lukhtadr acquired his heterodox opinions from a maula of Ali by the name 30 of Keisdn., " or the explanation recorded by Kashi 75 that Mukhtar was called Keishn after Ali's maula, "who induced him to seek revenge for al-Husein's blood and pointed out to him his murderers." Closest to the facts is Masudi V, 180: "They were called Keisa'iyya because of their relation to 35 1 The suffix in Z&gt;fJo literally refers to Muh. b. al-HI anafiyya, and so it is taken by de Slane, p. 403.

Somie of them, how- ever, hold that Eeisadn AbVl 'Omrra is not identical with al-Mukhtdr " (he refers for further information to his Makalat). 5The only correct explanation is the one offered by Ibn Hazm (here and Text, p. 77 "), who designates Keisan- Abftl 'Omra as the follower (?ahib) of Mukhtar. The person referred to is Keisan, the chief of Mukhta'r's body-guard, Tab. II, 671' (= IAth. IV, 187).' He was a maula of the 'Oreina, a elan of the ioSouthern Bajl1a (Wtistenfeld, Tabellen, 916), and stood at the head of the Mawali. As the latter were the main actors in Mukhtar's uprising (comp. especially the characteristic notice Tab. II, 6512), the sect, which first asserted itself on this occa- sion, received its name (perhaps as a nomen odiosum) from the 15 leader of the Mawali.2 So far the name of the sect. As for its tenets, they contain elements both of the Zeiditic and the Imamitic creed, a circum- stance which renders the classification of the Keisaniyya within the bipartite division of Shiism extremely difficult. Their cardi- 20 nal doctrine is the recognition of the Imamate of Muhammed b. al-Hanafiyya. But while agreeing with the Zeidiyya in reject- ing the strictly legitimate principle in the Imamate and basing the claims of the Imam on his personal qualifications,3 they strongly emphasize with the Imafmiyya his supernatural knowl- 25 edge of mystic lore.4 In consequence of this ambiguous position, the theologians often count the Keisaniyya as an independent sect, on an equal footing with the Zeidiyya and Imamiyya, thus, e. g., Shahr. 109, Bagd. 9b, Isfr. 7a. The latter two, however, become unfaithful to their own classification and occasionally so reckon the Keisaniyya among the Imamiyya: 054N xi.4J RxAUYI i Isfr. 14b (the same Bagd.). I. H., too, appears to 1 Kashi 75 strangely misses the point when he states that Mukhtar was called Keisan "after his sahib ash-Shortah whose kunya was Abft Ormra and whose name was Keisan." See his other explanation above. 2 Comp. Wellhausen, Opp. 89, and the footnote. 3 Ibn Hazm can scarcely be correct when he incidentally remarks (Ed. IV, 1034) that according to the Keisaniyya, Muhammed b. al-Jana- fiyya was Imam through a written statement (z 4 Van Vloten, Chiitisme, p. 41-42.</page><page sequence="35">Vol. xxix.] lThe Ieterodloxies of the Shiites, etc. 35 waver on this point.' While in our passage he expressly [44] designates them as a branch of the Zeidiyya-and he is the more justified in doing so, as, in distinction from all other writers, he regards as the cardinal doctrine of the Zeidiyya the recogni- tion of the Imamate in all the descendants of Ali (not Fatima),2- 5 he counts them repeatedly (Text 4514, 5312 54") among the sects of the Imamiyya. After the death of Muh. b. al-Hanafiyya, the Keisahniyya fell asunder into a number of factions. The most important of these was the Hdshimiyya, which transferred the Imamate to his son lo Abft HAshim and considered him the heir of his father's mystic knowledge, Shahr. 112. Abft Hashim having died without offspring, the l'aTshimiyya were again divided into a large number of factions, which assigned the Imamate to various pretenders. Only a fraction of the Keisaniyya, stimulated 15 by the mystery that surrounded Muh.'s death,3 denied his death altogether, and believed that he was hidden in the Radwa mountains, whence he would "return." This belief, as is well-known, found its poetical expression through Kuthay- yir and as-Sayyid, and became through them known as specific- 20 ally Keisanitic.4 A notice by Bagd.

The Radwa mountain (or rather mountains) is situated at a distance of seven days from Medina, Yakut II, 790. It was 5 considered extremely fertile, and was believed to be one of the mountains of Paradise.2 The individual traits, with which the belief in Ibn al-Hana- fiyya's sojourn in Radwa has been embellished, are properly intel- ligible only when we bear in mind their origin, as well as the 1origin of the underlying conception, which is no other than the Messianic idea. On the overwhelming influence of this idea over Islam, see de Sacy XXXI if., van Vloten, Chiitisme 54ff. and my essay " Die Messiasidee im Islam " (in Festschrift zum siebzigsten Geburtstage A. Berliner's, Frankfurt a. M. 1903, pp. 15116-130, especially 121 if. and 127). This influence also shows itself in numerous minor details which the Muhammedan theolo- gians, being unaware of their origin, were bound to misunder- stand, and which they in consequence purposely modified. A striking example of this tendency is offered, in our opinion, by 20the detail, also recorded by I. H., that Ibn al-Hanafiyya was sur- rounded by beasts of prey. The original significance of this conception can scarcely be doubtful when examined in the form in which it appears in a poem of as-Sayyid (Agh. VII, 4). In view of the importance of the question, I quote the decisive 25verses in the original, adding the vowels and a translation: ' Makr. 3521 says briefly A?| ; A / _ f 54lsf 2,+1Q iJUi (i~.X4J~ .rLoN! 9D a A d Still briefer Abu'l-Maali 158 YS/5f iC ll jCJ .-Is this Abfi Karb, of whom nothing else is known, identical perhaps with SJI &gt;At whom Ali banished for his extravagant doctrines, Ikd 269 ? 2 Interesting in this connection is Burton's remark (Pilgrimage to al-Medinah and Mecca, ed. 1898, I, 222): " I heard much of its val- leys and fruits and bubbling springs, but afterward I learned to rank these tales with the superstitious legends attached to it.

But 5 he can be seen in Radwa in a glen among leopards and lions. He resides between land marks (?),1 while big-eyed kine and the young ones of ostriches walk about at evening tide in the company of speckled goats. Together with them graze beasts of prey. Yet none of them attacks them to tear them with the lo point (of their teeth ?). They (the tame animals) are through him2 secure from destruction, and they feed together without fear on the same meadow and at the same drinking place." There is no need to prove that this description is a reflex of the Messianic prophecy Isa. 11, and the parallel is far more strik- 15 ing when we take into consideration the orthodox Muhammedan belief that at the end of Time, when Jesus shall have re-appeared and introduced the Golden Age, "lions and camels, tigers and oxen, wolves and lambs will graze peacefully together, and boys will play with snakes without danger."3 This original 20 idea of the eternal peace extending over the wild animals can still be discerned in I.

IV, 17921) */^&lt; L"I?. &amp; H el ..; and thus read the plural, which is also found in as-Sayyid's poem (first line of our quotation).4 In any event, the Messianic character of this conception was 25 misunderstood.

I. H.'s words remind one vividly of I Kings 17, 6.

"The belief of the Wakifiyya attaches to M-fsa b. Ja'far. They are identical with the Mamtfira, and it is by this name that this party is known in distinction from other sects of the Shiites" (Masudi VII, 117).

Two trustees of M-fsa, who were in charge of a fund of 30,000 dinArs consisting of taxes that belonged to M-fsa, had squandered the money while the latter was in prison. When M-fsa died, the trus- tees, fearing the claims of his heirs, denied Mftsa's death, and endeavored to spread the belief in his "return." I The opposition of the "Twelvers " to this belief vented itself in the invention of utterances, usually put into the mouth of Ja'far. which violently protest against the M-fsawiyya doctrine.

The belief that Ali was hidden in the clouds whence he would return on earth is ascribed by all theological writers (Shahr. 132 ult.; Iji 343; Makr 3571; see also IKhald. I, 358) to Ibn Sabat. While many, or most, doctrines attributed to this founder of Shiism are apocryphal or of later origin, this belief 20is no doubt authentic. This conception must have become extremely popular among the Shiites at an early period, as numerous early authorities bear witness to it. Muslim, Sahilh (Cairo 1284k', I, 51) in the name of Sufyan (ath-Thaurl, died 161): ylrJ1 UL 'I J "' xLa 31)).

Lahi'a, the well-known [45] Shiitic traditionist (died 174), "who was a silly, weak-minded old man, believed that Ali was in the clouds. He would sit in our midst, then look up to the clouds and exclaim: 'Here is Ali, passing in the clouds !" (JKhald. II, 155, quoting from 5 an-Nasa'i, died 757th). The poet Ishak b.

This belief spread the more easily, as Ali's grave was unknown,' Damlrl, Haydt al-Hayaiadn (BfdAk 1284h) II, 267. According to Ibn Asakir (died 571), 410 the camel which was carrying Ali's body to Medina to be buried there disappeared with the body: "for this reason the people of 'Irak say he is in the clouds." On the Messianic basis of this conception, see my essay " Die Messiasidee im Islam," p. 125. 15 -L. 9 ff. This utterance of Ibn Saba is in all probability derived from the anecdote told by Jahiz, Baydn (Cairo 1313'h) II, 73,5 on the authority of ash-Sha'bi (d. 103). A certain Jarlr b. Keis met Ibn as-Sauda (=Ibn Saba) in Madain.6 "He (Ibn Saba) said: What is the news? I said: the Commander20 of the Faithful (=Ali) has been killed . . . He said: Even if you had brought us his brain in a hundred bags, we would surely know that he would not die till he should drive you with his stick."

The former is found, e. g., Masudi VIII, 40; Shahr. 17, 127, 128, 147; Makr. 35124. The latter form is consistently used by I. H., Bagd. and Isfr., also Masudi V, 443, 475. The form Kitti'iyya as the more unusual one seems to be original. 35 VOL. XXIX. 4</page><page sequence="50">50 1. Friedlaender, [1908. [47] The nature of the Kitti'iyya can best be understood when contrasted with its antithesis, the Wakifiyya or Wakifa, p. 40. The point of controversy is the reality of the Imam's death (see p. 30) and the question, dependent on it, of the election of a 5 successor. i or H 3O A d means " to be uncertain, to be in doubt;' as regards the Imam's death," i. e., refuse to believe that the Imam is dead and, still recognizing him as Imam, refrain from electing a successor. The exact reverse of it is &amp;,? cL; "definitely to assert his death," to 1o believe that the death of the Imam was real and, in consequence, transfer (,jLw) the Imamate from the dead Imam to his suc- cessor. This state of the case is still perfectly clear in Shahr., as the following examples will show: 173 ... 1 At xbo5Yt &lt;.:un ~P? &lt; Lli &gt;? 18 an* 1pi&gt;wJ 15b &gt;tXL? 1Mu .

[2 d&amp;; ?Jnx h 47] '.O;i iJ u U I Both the beliefs of the Kittl'iyya and Wakifiyya are in them- selves merely relative conceptions and express but a certain attitude of mind. They become real only when applied to 5 certain definite individuals. In consequence of this their rela- tive character, their contents are somewhat elastic and change in accordance with the person to whom they are applied. As a rule, the contrast between the two sects hinges on the person of M-fsa b. Ja'far (p. 39'5), the succession down to Ja'far, hisio father, being a matter of common agreement among the Shiites (p. 10426). Those that refuse to admit his death and await his "return " are called Wakifiyya (also M-fsawiyya and, with their nickname, Mamtfra, p. 4012). Those, on the other hand, who admit his death and in consequence transfer the Imamate to his 15 descendants are called the Kittf'iyya. Comp. the passages quoted above from Shahr. See Masudi V, 443: Hishafm b. al-Hakam (p. 65") was an intimate friend of Mfisa b. Ja'far. Yet he was a Kitti 'iy, i. e., he believed that Milsa was dead. Bagd. 19a: '~~~~A ?' 'Alb ? &amp; Qto31A 2 Kashi in a special article on the Wakifiyya, p. 284- 288, understands and applies this term in the same manner. The name, however, occurs also in connection with other individuals of the Alidic family. Thus Wakifiyya is found as another designation for Isma- 25 'iliyya, those who believe in the "return" of Musa's brother Isma' l, Shahr. 127. I I have dwelt at some length on this point, as Haarbrfacker in his Shahr. translation utterly misunderstood the whole matter. He takes la" in its ordinary meaning " to cut off " (abschneiden) and interprets it in the sense " to cut off the series of Imams" and allow no further Imam. In consequence, the contradictio in adiecto that those who cut off (i. e., close) the series of Imams transfer the Imamate to their descendants, is repeatedly to be met with in his translation. E. g., I, 25: "Andere machen mit seinem Tode einen Abschnitt und ffthren das Imamat auf seinen Sohn tiber," or, still more nonsensically, 192: "Andere schnitten mit seinem Tode (die Reihe der Imame) ab" and so forth. The same, Wolff, Drusen, p. 82 ff. -It is difficult to see how these authors could make any sense out of this translation.</page><page sequence="52">52 I. Friedlaender, [1908. [47] The name Kittl'iyya is found in connection with Ali, the son of Mfsa, Makr. 35125. Zeid. 104U applies this term to the "followers of Ali b. Muhammed," apparently referring to Ali an-Naki (died 254), the grandfather of thU Shiitic Mahdi 5 "the man of the cellar." Gradually, however, the two terms were used pre-eminently in connection with the Mahdi, the Imam of the "Twelvers." Those who did not admit the death of his father, al-Hasan al- 'Askari, and consequently rejected his own claims to the Imamate 1o are called the Wikifiyya, IBab., Ithbat 39 (p. 36, however, this term is used as a synonym for the Mftsawiyya). Those again who believed in al-Hasan's death and transferred the Imamate to the Mahdi, were called the Kitti'iyya. With the spread of the " Twelvers " and the extinction of the other Shiitic factions, 15the term Kitti'iyya became the exclusive possession of this sect and was generally used as a synonym for Ithna'ashariyya, which is probably of later origin (I. H. does not use it in his ]Iilal), comp. I. H. in our passage; Shahr. 17, 127, 147; Masudi V, 475; Bagd. 196 expressly IA L 4i Jt4.7 and in the same 20way Isfr. 13 b The old Marracci recognized the identity of the Kitti'iyya with the Ithna'ashariyya. The rebuke preferred against him by de Sacy (II, 590 n. 1=Wolff, Drusen, p. 83, n. 1) is without justification. 25 48, 1. 3 if. See I. H.'s remarks on the same subject, Text [48] p. 76' if. I. H.'s account on the Mahdi is extremely interesting and in many a detail quite novel.' L. 5. The year of al-Hasan's death is unanimously given as 260. All other dates and facts of the Mahdi's life were 30 early entangled in myth and legend. This shows itself at once in the question as to the date of his birth, which is extremely problematic. Conspicuous in its tend- ency is the notion that he was born on the day on which his father died, Blochet 21. It betrays itself through the explana- 35tory remark that the Mahdi has, just like Jesus, been Imam since his infancy. According to another supposition (comp. 1 Sibt, Imams, remarkably enough says nothing about the twelfth Imam.</page><page sequence="53">Vol. xxix.] The Ileterodoxies of the Shiites, etc. 53 Text here, 1. 7) he was born eight months after his father's [48] death, Shahr. 130". Repeatedly to be found as the year of his birth is 258, i. e., two years before his father's death, IBab. Ithbat 441. 2 (read ?wS3)J. instead of bad)); Ibn Z-fl'k (died 387h) in IKhall. No. 573; Diyarbekrl, II, 288. Very frequently 5 the year 255 is given, Abu'l-Maali 164; Anon. Sufi 170a; Abul- feda II, 222; IKhall. ib.1 See the various suppositions Shahr. 129-130. The insinuation that the Mahdi was not born at all I have not met with outside of I. H. lIe repeats the same charge Ed. IV, 1o 96': "If so, what need is there for them (the Imams), espe- cially so for the last 180 years ? (see Introduction, p. 19). For they pretend to have a lost Imain who (however) was never created, just like the fabulous griffin." Gen. Leyd. omits the Mahdi altogether, as it only records the Alides who had off- 15 spring. Al-Hasan, however, is designated as Ab-f Jluhammed. The identity of the Mahdi's name with that of the Prophet which is demanded by the Mahdi traditions is regarded by the Shiites as proof of the legitimacy of the twelfth Imam.2 To the same end the Prophet's kunya Ab-f'l-Kasim was conferred20 on him.3 The generally accepted Mahdi tradition demands, besides, identity in the father's name. But there are variations of this tradition which are so trimmed as to meet the special circumstances of the twelfth Mahdi, comp. IKhald. II, 144 ff.; Divarbekri, II, 288. 25 -L. 11 f. A more elaborate form of this anecdote see Blochet 22 (who writes flakimeh). The motive of the anecdote is the Shiitic tendency to pattern the image of the Mahdi after that of Jesus, whose advent at the end of time is expected by all Muhammedans. The miracle of "talking in the cradle" is 30 ascribed to Jesus, Koran 3, 41; 5, 109; 19, 30 ff.; comp. Gerock, Versuch einer -Darstellung der Christologie des Qoran ' The latter gives besides 256, which he considers correct. Anon. Sufi ib. quotes Yafi'Vs Ta'rlkh to the effect that al-Hasan died when the Mahdi was six or five years old, which would imply 254 and 255 respect- ively. 2 Already as-Sayyid al-Hiinyart refers to such a tradition, Agh. VII, 4. Zeid. Mutaz. 111 quotes a tradition according to which Muhammed ordered Ali to give his son his (the prophet's) name and kunya. He was referring to Muhammed b. al-Hanafiyya.</page><page sequence="54">54 1. I}iedlaender, [1908. [48] (1839), p. 47. The Sunnitic protest against the transferring of this miracle to the Mahdi found expression in an interpretation forcibly put upon the well-known hadith-in itself an anti- Shiitic protest " there is no Mahdi 5 except Jesus" ' : (read "that is, none except Jesus talks in the cradle (al-mahd)." See IKhald. II, 163 and 169. Lines 13, 15, 16. On the name or names of the Mahdi's mother see Diyarbekri, II, 288, IKhall. No. 573, who also adds 10 " Khamt " 2 (a sort of fragrant milk).

This claim of Inspiration is the reason why the Shiites object to religious discussions, p. 166. 25 In the same way as here and Text p. 3516 ff., I. H. expresses himself Ed. IV, 1048: "Some of them (the Imamiyya) when asked (to prove) the truth of their claim regarding the Imams (i. e., that the Imams are the only source of religious knowl- edge) take recourse to the claim of Inspiration in this matter. 1 Comp.

A Shiitic writer of the eleventh century (Hijra) uses the fol- 5 lowing characteristic argument to prove the superiority of the Imams and scholars of the Shi'a, Goldziher, Shi'a, p. 509: " because their words are not a matter of opinion or effort, but of true knowledge. Their source is either a tradition which everv one of them has received from his father, the latterio from his own father and so on up to the Prophet, or Revelation and Inspiration, so that both small and big are equal in this respect among them. For this reason it has never been recorded of any of them that he has ever gone to a teacher, or studied under a master, or asked any question." 15 - Note 5. The reading of Ed. and Codd. presupposes and the same word is found in Ed. Text 57's, 648 (see also Ed. IV, 97'0). It is possible to get along with the ordinary meaning of .,jb "clever, ingenious." L. 9 (note 10). I took this as an example of some mon- 20 strous (of course, imaginary) charge for which Inspiration might be invoked. See a similar charge note 9.

He pre- fers to retain 0, oin the text and to translate "or that all of them have a piece (lit. a branch) of madness in their25 heads. " L. 13 ff. (and previously). The tone in which I.

I have not found any reference to it elsewhere.2 The concluding words of this paragraph are characteristic 30 of I.

Perhaps the reason for it is that the Rawafid have [51] no hesitation to change their minds. as they attribute the same (see on the Bada doctrine, p. 726) to God. - L. 14. The belief in " tabdil" is, properly considered, the basis of Shiitic doctrine. It accounts for the lack of the 5 Prophet's written announcement regarding the succession of Ali and justifies the distrust toward the bearers of the Sunna, which again is the starting point for a complete remodelling of Islam. Isfr. 141' ably summarizes the far-reaching consequences of this belief: -%Ad 10yo ; Q /c&gt; &gt; s Moe c rhe ly a asz istor to bez e d f higher point of view does I. deal wihti prol -ay- 2S A5 elaorael tno-? refute Thefit is that &amp;the7 Caip O tha removed nueru reading fro3 the) Koan andr Athote xxAi ,Y1A +b Y 5 More comprehensively, and, as is to be expected, from a higher point of view does I.

The first is that the Caliph Othman removed numerous readings from the Koran, and the other</page><page sequence="62">62 I. Friedlaender, [1908. [51] "that the RawAfid maintain that the Companions of your Prophet altered the Koran by way of omissions and additions." The first objection I. H. discards briefly, though somewhat superficially, by pointing out that in the time of Othman the 5 Koran text was already so wide-spread and so firmly established, that the Caliph could not, even if he would, change it.' "As for their argument regarding the Rawafid and their contention that the Koran readings were interpolated, the Rawafid do not belong to the Muslims. They consist of a number of sects, the 10 first of which arose twenty-five years after the Prophet's death. It was originally the response of some people abandoned by Allah to the call of those who beguiled Islam,2 a party which followed the course of the Jews and Christians as regards falsehood and heresy. They are divided into various sections. The most 15 extravagant of them assume the divinity of Ali b. AbM Talib and of a number of people besides him. The least extravagant of them believe that the sun was twice turned backwards for Ali.3 How can one be indignant over lies coming from people whose lowest rank in lying is such (as described)?" He then pro- 20 ceeds elaborately to refute this charge. He cleverly beats the Rawafid with their own weapons by pointing (Ed. II, 80") to the fact that Ali himself, "who according to most of them is a god, a creator, and, according to some of them, a prophet endowed with speech, while in the opinion of the rest he is an 25infallible Imam, the obedience to whom is a religious command imposed by Law," did not object to the Koran in its present shape and, while Caliph, did not fight the interpolators, which would have been his sacred duty. " Thus the mendacity of the Raw-afid becomes evident, and praise be unto Allah, the Lord 30 of (all) Created Beings!" A brief reference to the same subject is contained Ed. IV, 14615: "unless the Rawafid fall back on ignoring the Koran and (assuming) omissions and additions in it. This is some- thing whereby becomes evident their impudence, ignorance and 35 stupidity.

This belief, however, is attributed to several men known as Keisa'nites, so to as-Sayyid al-Himyari (in our passage),2 Kuthayyir (p. 2627), 'Abdallah b.

The peculiar procedure described in this para- graph is the outcome of the belief in Transmigration. I. H.'s own expositions on the subject of Tanasukh (Ed. IV, 9014 f. in a special chapter) are apt to illustrate and explain our passage. 5 "Those1 that believe in the Transmigration of Souls are divided into two sections: one section holds that the souls on leaving the bodies are transferred to other bodies which2 are different from the kind of bodies they had left. This is the belief of Ahmad b. Ha'it3 [V + the pupil of an-Nazzam]4, of Ahmad b. ioNanfts, his pupil [V.: the pupil of Ibn H1'it], of Abf Muslim of Khorasan, of Muhammed b. Zakarfya ar-Razi, the physician,6 who expressly advocates this (doctrine) in his book entitled "al-'Ilm al-1I1hi." This is also the belief of the Carmathians [V+-the Keisaniyya and some of the Rdfida] . . . These peo- 15ple are of the opinion that the Transmigration of Souls takes place in the form of Punishment and Reward. They say: the soul of the sinner who has made himself guilty of bad actions is transferred to the bodies of repulsive animals7 which wallow in all kinds of filth, which are forced to work, are inflicted with 20pain, and are used for slaughtering."

He moved to Bagdad3 in 199 and is said to have died in the same year.4 15 He belonged to the intimate circle of M-fsa b. Ja'far (p. 3915), but he had also, when still a young man (Kashi 167), come in contact with Ja'far (Fihr., Tusy), who converted him from his heresies to the orthodox Imamitic belief (Kashi). In spite of the difference in opinion, he held intimate intercourse with 20 'Abdallah b. Yazld, the founder of the Kharijite sect Ibadiyya, Masudi V, 343. He was considered an authority on the Imamate question. When a Syrian once came to Ja'far and insisted, among other things, on having an argument about the Imamate, he was 25 referred to Hisham (Kashi 179). The theory of the Imamate is the central point of his doctrine. He compared the Imamate I Ja'far as-Shdik. 2 This either refers to Sheitn at-Thk (p. 599) or to Hishim b. al-Hakam, this page, 1. 11. They both bore the nickname al-Ahwal. 3 Kashi quotes an exact topographical description of his Bagdad resi- dence by an eye-witness. 4According to Kashi, he died in Kufa twenty years earlier, 179, during the reign of ar-Rashid. But this can scarcely be correct, as he was a young man during Ja'far's (died 146) lifetime. See the following. VOL. XXIX. 5</page><page sequence="66">66 I. -Friedlaender, [1908.

" pleasing": if anything pleases God, he may change a previous decision) presup- poses the belief in the changeability of the Divine Will (cf. p. 6625) and is a counterpart of the orthodox belief in 10 Naskh (the abolition by God of a previously revealed Law). Generally this doctrine is regarded as a specific tenet of the Keisaniyya, Bagd. 11b; Makr. 3522; Iji, who makes no mention of the Keisaniyya, enumerates in their stead the Bada'iyya (3484). This belief is supposed to have been invented ad hoc is by Mukhtar (p. 7911) wheni, contrary to his prophecies, he was defeated in battle, Bagd. i5a; Isfr. iia; Shahr. 110. Well- hausen, however, points out (Opp. 88) that, according to Tab. II, 73210 and 70614, it was 'Abdallah b. Nauf who originated this doctrine, in opposition to Mukhta'r.1 20 The Zeidite Suleiman b. Jarir (p. 1367) makes the Rawafid (= Ima'miyya, Appendix A) in general responsible for this belief, Shahr. 119 penult.2 IBab., however, (I'tikadat fol. 6a) protests against those who charge the Imamites with Bada'. These peo- ple merely imitate the Jews who prefer the same charge (he 25 apparently means Xaskh) against the Muslims. He quotes Ja'far as-Sadik as saying that he who believes in Bada is a Kafir.3 A curious instance of the application of the Bada doctrine is quoted lAth. VIII, 21. Ab-f'l-Khattab (p. 112) and his adher- 30 ents claimed that no sword could do them any harm. But when some of them had been executed, he resorted to the pretext: "since it pleased God to do otherwise, how can I help it"? *s~ E . &amp; ^I E~ Hi i 14M ' It must be remarked, however, that Tab.

[54] residents of Paradise and Hell ": " All sects of the (Muhamme- dan) Community agree that there is no decay for Paradise and its pleasure nor for Hell and its pain. The only exceptions are Jahm b. Safwan, Ab-'l-Hudeil al-'Allaf and some of' the Rawdfid. 5 Jahm maintains that both Paradise and Hell will decay and their residents as well.' Abft'l-Hudeil, however, maintains that neither Paradise and Hell nor their residents will decay. But the movements of the latter will decay and they will remain in an immovable state like a mineral. In spite of it, they will lobe alive and enjoy pleasure and suffer pain respectively. The party of the Rawafid referred to above believes that the resi- dents of Paradise will leave Paradise and the residents of Hell will leave Hell for some unknown destination (lit.: whither it is Allah's desire)."' See Iji 336; Makr. 34928.-On AbiX'l- 15Hudeil's view see de Boer, p. 51. A certain heretic by the name of 'Abdallah b. 'Abdallah b. Shuneif attacks a friend of I.

The eternity of the world is taught by the Mu'am- 20mariyya, a section of the Khatta'biyya, p. 1141", see Shahr. 137 Makr. 3528; Iji 346. This belief is the outcome of the doc- trine of Transmigration (Makr.), as the latter, taking the place of Reward and Punishment after death, dispenses with Resur- rection and accordingly with the establishment of a new world. 25Isfr 57b is apparently aware of this connection when he curtly remarks: oyJyAA, i;Jj uSnj, i Y L&amp;J D The way this view is contrasted with the belief in the decay of Paradise and Hell suggests a connection between them. In 30point of fact, the belief in Transmigration, when carried out logically, not only necessitates the eternity of this world, but, fulfilling the function of Reward and Punishment, dispenses altogether with Paradise and Hell.

Bekrf, -Description de l'Afrique Septentrionale, ed. de Slane, Alger, 1857, p. 161, gives a brief description of this sect which offers several important points of comparison 5 with the account of I. H. I give Bekrl's passage .in transla- tion: " To the right of the Banft MagVfts there is a tribe called Band Lamas. They are all, Rawafid and known under the name Bajalivyyn. There settled in their midst a Bajalitel of the people of Nafta in Kastilia, before Abfi 'Abdallah ash- l0 Shii ' entered Ifrikiya.2 His name was Muhammed b. Wrstd (bawd sic). He called upon them (read KLAUSO) to denounce the Companions (of the Prophet) and permitted them forbidden things . . . They still adhere to his doctrine to this day and (believe) that the Imamate is permissible only in the descend-15 ants of al-Hasan, not in those of al-H'usein. Their ruler was Idris Abft'l-Kasim b. Mubammed b. Ja'far b 'Abdallah b. Idris." The name of the founder of this sect appears here in a differ- ent form. lIaukal 6521 (=Yakut I, 320) agrees with I. H. in calling him G t, but they omit the mention of his first 20 name. The name and pedigree of their ruler are altogether different and I have no means to decide which are the correct ones. 3 As regards the cardinal doctrine of this sect-the limitation of the Imamate to the Hasanides-Bekri agrees with I. H. (55,1. 5). 25 In contradiction with it, IHaukal (=Yakut) reports that they were Mi6sawites (cf. p. 40), i. e. acknowledged the Imamate of Mftsa b. Ja'far, who was descended from al-Husein. The former statement is no doubt correct, as the Idrisides who ruled over them were Hasanides. 30 L. 14. On Nafta see Yakut IV, 800.

The latter two and Iji state the [56] comparison more elaborately: "more than one raven the other one and one fly the other one." The adherents of this sect curse the " sAhib ar-rish," i. e. Jibril. In a parallel between the Rawa'fid and the Jews put into the mouth of ash-Sha'bi (Ikd 269, 10 comp. p. 1916) the two are identified because of their dislike of Gabriel.' Bagd. 98b sorrowfully remarks that the G4aiya are even worse than the Jews, for the latter, though disliking Gabriel, yet abstain from cursing him. In his polemics against Judaism, I. H. (Ed. I, 138') very15 cleverly draws a parallel between the Jews who believe that Isaac confounded Esau with Jacob and the Gurabiyya. " This contention (of the Jews) very closely resembles the stupidity of the Gurabiyya2 among the Raffida who believe that Allah dis- patched Jibrll to Ali,3 but Jibril erred and went to Muhammed. 20 In the same way Isaac blessed Esau, but the blessing erred and went to Jacob. Upon both parties (may rest) the curse of Allah !" - L. 13 f. Ali was about thirty years younger than the Prophet (comp. Kremer, IdZeen,, p. 315). Consequently he was 25 ten years old when Muhammed made his first appearance. The same is assumed Ed. IV, 1421b and in the variant of L. Br. to our passage (note 7); The reading of Ed. seems to be incor- rect. But there is a difference of opinion as to the date of Ali's birth, see I. II in the quoted passage and Tab.

It is characteristic that both Sunnitic and Shiitic writers anxiously avoid to mention this feature of Ali which is so repugnant to the Arabic taste.

The omission (in 1. 6) of the tenth Imam, Ali b. Muhammed (al-Hadi at-Taki, 30born 214, died 254), is, it seems, not accidental. For in accord- ance with it, Ali (l. 7) is changed to Muhammed. The same omission and the same change are exhibited by Codd. L. Br. Text p. 76, note 4 and 5.'

His tenets, which show all the earmarks of "I uluww, " seem to have exercised a powerful influence in ultra- Shiitic circles. The Imamites solicitously rejeet any connection 15with Mugira, see the article on Mugira, Kashi 145 if. Ja'far as-Sadik is reported as saying that all the extravagant views to be found in the writings of his father's (Muhammed al-Bakir's, died 117h) followers are forgeries of Muglra, ib. 146, 147. His system, if system it be called, presents an odd mixture of 20 ancient Eastern beliefs and distinctly shows the influence of gnostic, notably of Mandvean and Manichvean, doctrines. The Mandeans were very numerous in Irak; at the time of the Abbassides they are said to have had there 400 churches. Their head resided in Bagdad.' The Manichveans, too, were identi- 25 fied with 'Irak. "Mani was born in Babylonia, and he was believed (according to al-Bir-ftnl) to have been. sent to the people of Babylonia only. Their head had to reside in Baby- lonia.2 The Harranians, too, who may be mentioned in this connection, were very numerous in 'Irak.' On these influences 30see van Vloten, Chiitismne 47; Blochet 135, the latter also in Revue de iThistoire des Religions, XL (1899), p. 25, note 1.L It can scarcely be doubted that ultimately all these influences root in the ancient religion of Babylonia; see Kessler ibidem, I Kessler, Article " Mandder " in PRE3, XII (1903), p. 172. 2 Kessler, Article " Manichaer" ibidem, p. 226, Flfigel, Mani 97, 105. 3 Chwolsohn, Ssabier I, 482 ff. 4 It is perhaps not insignificant that a part of the Banaf 'Ijl (see above p. 7931) who lived in Balrein "completely passed into the Persian nation- ality."

The corporeal conception of the Godhead was cur- rent in Shiitic circles, see, e. g., p. 67. The crown in this con- lo nection is found in various philosophemes. In the Cabbala the "Crown" (nUn) is the highest of the Ten Sefiroth (Spheres). The latter are represented in the shape of a man with a crown on his head; comp. the diagram in the Jewish Encyclopedia I, 181b and in the Hebrew Encyclopedia (t)KuWt 1'3yK), New 15 York, 1907, I, 183. See also later, p. 83. According to Shahr.; Makr. 3494; Bagd. 95b f. and others, Mujira believed that God was a man of light bearing a crown of light. This reminds one of the Mandaean doctrine of the "King of Light." Brandt, 1anddiische Religion (G6ttingen20 1889) ?? 19-20, 80-81; the same, Mandaische Schriften (Gbt- tingen 1893), p. 13-19. -L. 6. Bagd. 96a is less scrupulous and adds two more instances: 'Ain for the eye and Ha' for the pudenda. A very similar description of God is quoted in the name of the Gnos- 25 tics bv Irenaeus, adversus Haereticos2 XIV, 3. A Jewish paral- lel, see in Gaster, "Das Schiur Komah," fonatsschrift fau Geschichte uud Wissenschaft des Judentums 37 (1893), p. 225. Similar speculations about the shape of the letters in the name &amp;Jr and bask (the latter in K-fic), see Blochet, 133, 192. 30 L. 12 ff. This peculiar theory of Creation is evidently the reflection of a Gnostic doctrine. Irenaeus, adversus ffaeret. XIV 1, reports a similar theory in the same of the Gnostic 'I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to my friend and colleague, Prof. Louis Ginzberg, who lent me his effectual aid in pointing out the Rabbinical illustrations, the latter, too, bearing witness to the same influences. I profited by his valuable advice also in other parts of this treatise. 2 The following quotations all refer to the first Book. VOL. XXIX. 6</page><page sequence="82">82 I. Friedlaender, [1908. [59] Marcus': "When first the unoriginated, inconceivable Father, who is without material substance, and is neither male nor female, willed to bring forth that which is ineffable in Him, and to endow with form that which is invisible, He opened His 5 mouth, and sent forth the Word, similar to Himself Moreover, the pronunciation of His name took place as follows: He spake the first word of it which was the beginning [of all the rest] and that utterance consisted of four letters. He added the second," and so forth. In Jewish Mysticism similar 1onotions can be traced. Comp. Menakhoth 29b: " God created the two worlds (this and the future world) through the letters He and Yod (constituting the Divine name Yah)." See also Berakhoth 5ta. A similar theory is elaborately set forth in Sefer Yesirah and is to be found in other ancient mystical 15 works. It may be mentioned in this connection that under the influence of a similar notion the Mandaean verb W " to call" has assumed the meaning "to create." See Kessler, art. "Mandiier" ibid. - p. 16439 and p. 165. -L. 12. The " Greatest Name " is, as was already pointed 20out by de Sacy XLVII, note, identical with the "Shem ha-Me- phorash," the "'Ineffable Name" which occupies so prominent a place in the Jewish mystical speculations of all ages (see M. Grinbaum, Gesammelte Aufsatze (Berlin 1901), p. 238 ff.; Revue cdes AEtudes Juives 19, 290 f.). It plays an important part in 25 Islam as well, and here, too, the belief is current that by means of the Ineffable Name all miracles can be easily performed; see, e. g., Ikd 396, and (as an illustration) IKhall. No. T76.' Most of the sources dealing with Mugira report that he claimed 1 I quote the translation of Roberts and Rambaut, Edinburgh, 1868. 2According to I.

Instead of x. z A F "and it (the Greatest Name) fell (L. Br.: flew and fell) on his crown," Bagd., Shahr. and Iji 343 give the important variant 1 xU "fell upon his head as a crown."

The same conception of the identity of the "Shem ha-Mephorash" with the Crown is frequently found in the Cabbala. It takes the form that the name was 15 engraved upon the Crown, see Jew. _Enc.

For the latter was considered as the party of Ali /car' eFoxfiv, see p. 10127. 2 Prof. Ginzberg suggests a connection with Is. 49, 16: " Behold I have engraved thee on my palms." It may be the consequence of some mystic interpretation of this verse.</page><page sequence="84">84 I. Friedlaender, [89O8. [59] (fliOrr) "all that is of a liquid nature was formed," funnily remarks that he could easily enlarge upon it. "For when I perceive that waters are in part fresh . . . and in part salt, . . . I reflect with mvself that all such waters cannot be derived 5from her tears, inasmuch as these are of a saline quality only. It is clear, therefore, that the waters which are salt are alone those which are derived from her tears. But it is probable that she, in her intense agony and perplexity, was covered with perspiration. And hence, following out their notion, we may 10 conceive that fountains and rivers, and all the fresh waters in the world, are due to this source." A somewhat similar idea is found in the Talmud (Hagiga i3b): " Whence does the stream Dinftr (Daniel 7, 10) come ? From the perspiration of the Holy living Creatures."' [Cf. Bereshith Rabba, ch. 78.] 15 The two lakes, then, are formed of the Divine tears and the Divine perspiration respectively. They no doubt correspond to the mndy siydwe' and the mrdye hitdre, the " dark and white waters" of the Mandueans; see Brandt, Manddische Religion, pp. 30, 43, 51, etc.-Instead of "sweet" (11. 17 and 22) read 20 "4 fresh." L. 18 if. The same conception is found in several Gnostic systems, notably among the Mandoeans. "When Life . . had thus spoken, Abatur rose and opened the gate. He looked into the Dark Water, and at the same hour was formed his image 215in the Dark Water. Ptahil2 was formed and he ascended the Place of the Borders." Illustrative of 1. 19 is the passage in Irenaeus XIV, 1: " The world, again, and all things therein, were made by a certain company of seven angels. Man, too, was the workmanship of 30 angels, a shining image bursting forth below from the presence of the Supreme power; and when they could not, he says, keep hold of this, because it immediately darted upwards again, they exhorted each other saying: let us make man after our image and likeness." 35 -L. 20.

Sin, and correspondingly Evil as being primitive and co-existent with Creation, is a widespread Gnostic doctrine and is a consequence of Dualism, which is at the bottom of all lo Gnostic systems.

This is important in view of the numerous Shiitic doctrines which are based on the same number of prophets (see Index s.v. Seven).-The conception of the " true Prophet" is complemented, it seems, by the Clementine 5 belief that God has the power of changing himself: " for through his inborn Spirit He becomes, by a power which cannot be described, whatever bodv He likes" (Homilies XX, 6). This is practically the doctrine of Incarnation, which is of such fundamental significance for the Ultra-Shi'a. -Another instance 1oof the adaptation of a Clementine doctrine, see p. 116 n. 2. L. 2.

[621 to the Karmatian theory of the seven prophets and their substi- tutes (cf. p. 796).1 The significant passage Kashi 187 (parallel 195) may bear some relation to the subject in question. Ja'far as-Sadik makes the following statement: " Allah revealed in the 5 Koran seven (pseudo-prophets ?) with their names. The Kureish, however, struck out six and left only Ab-f Lahab." When subsequently asked about the saying of Allah (Koran 26, 221-222): "' Shall I inform you of those on whom the Satans have descended? Descended they have on every sinful liar," iohe replied: "They are seven: al-Mugira b. Sa'id, BunAD (see p. 888), SA'id an-Nahdl, al-Halrith ash-Sha'ml, 'Abdallah b. al- Harith,2 Hamza b. 'Oma-ra az-Zubeiri3 and Ab-f'l-Khattab (p. 112)." Ab-f Mans-fr is not mentioned. L. 7. According to Makr. 478 ult., the Jewish sectarian s5 Abf 'ITsa al-Isbahani similarly claimed "that he was lifted up to heaven and the Lord patted him on his head." The early Jewish sects under Arabic dominion show a great many traces which remind one of the early Muhammedan sects, especially those of the Shi'a. 20 - L. 9.

Shahr. 136' says less 15 distinctly: "his (Abft Mansftr's) adherents thought it permissi- ble to kill their opponents and take away their property." Assassination is designated as a peculiarity of the Mugiriyvya and Mansftriyya (see Index sub voce Terrorism). Ja'hiz in his Kitd4 al-Hayawdn gives an account of the manners of these 20 terrorists of the eighth century. He who practised both " I strangling " and "skull-breaking " was styled "JAmi ', " "Com- biner." This extremely curious and interesting passage is reproduced and discussed by van Volten, WIVrgers in Eaxtq (in a Dutch article. See List of Cited Works sub voce van Vloten, 25 Worgers). The Thugs in India, whose beginnings date as far back as the first Muhammedan caliphs, also kill their victims by strangling. The theological substructure for this peculiar tenet is sup- plied by I. H., Ed. IV, 17111: " The command to do right and 30 the prohibition to do wrong' must be carried out with the heart and, if possible, with the tongue. It must not be executed by (employing) the hand nor in any way by drawing the sword or using arms. . . All the Rawafid hold to it, though they all be killed (see the reading of L. Br., Text 63; note 1). But they 35 believe in it only as long as the "Speaking" (Imam)2 does not come forth. When he does come forth, then the drawing of swords becomes obligatory. If not, then it is not (obligatory) . . 1 Koran 3, 100. 106. 110; 7, 156, etc. 2 Comp. the B~tiniyya, p. 112 n. 3.</page><page sequence="93">Vol. xxix.] VTe Heterodoxies of the Shiites, etc. 93 Certain sections of the Sunnites, all the Mu'tazilites, all the [62] Kbawarij and Zeidiyya (comp.

See following 5 note. 63, 1. 1 and note 1. The Khashabiyya are connected with [63] the Keisaniyya (ib. note 1) and originated simultaneously with them in the uprising of al-Mukhtar. IKot. 300 thus explains the name: "the Khashabiyya of the Rawafid: Ibrahim b. al-Ashtar lo encountered 'Obeidallah b. Ziya'd. The majority of Ibrahim's followers were carrying with them wooden arms (al-khashab). They were, in consequence, called the Khashabiyya. Masudi V, 226 (anno 67) relates that al-Mukhtar "began to go forth every day to fight Mus'ab and those that followed him of the people 15 of Kufa. Al-Mukhtar (on the other hand) had with him many people of the Shi'a. They were called the Khashabiyya (belong- ing) to the Keisafniyya." Comp. also the notice Agh. VI, 139 (=Tab. II, 17984): "'Othman al-Khashabi belonged to the Khashabiyya who were with al-Mukhtair." When Muhallab,20 who fought against al-Mukhta r, was besieging the city of Nisibis which was defended by the Khashabiyya, he thus addressed himself to the inhabitants: " 0 ye people! Let not these men frighten you. They are only slaves and have in their hands (nothing but) sticks." (Agh. V, la5; comp. Tab. II, 68416)225 These sticks were designated by a Persian word as v.:Ob V "the heretic knockers," a name which is characteristic of the 'Ikd 269: "' To the RifANa (also belonged) the Huseiniyya.

Instead of i.A,;,A&gt; is most probably to be read A (see later). It seems, however, that this reading is not a scribal error but due to the author (or his source) who, neglecting the important detail that they were carrying wooden arms (khashab), brought the name into connection with the war-cry of the party (" Revenge for al- Husein !

[63] part played by the Persian element in al-Mukht'r's rebellion. Thus Tab. II, 694' (anno 66) relates that the Khashabiyya who arrived in Mekka to liberate Muhammed b. a]-Hanafiyya (comp. 6934) entered the Holy Mosque, carrying with them the 5 "heretic knockers" and shouting: "On to tbe revenge for al- Husein! " The Kafir-kftbat occur also later in the rebellion of Abif Muslim (see the quotation in de Goeje, Bibliotheca Geogr. Arabic. IV, 278) and as late as anno 257 (lAth. VII, 995) 2 10 The name Khashabiyya, it seems, never came into general use. It is often written x and, in consequence of the war cry of this party (revenge for al-Husein!), also i .i;; see the variants in Tab., van Vloten, Worgers, and Ikd (Comm. 93, n. 1). 5h Originally the name was probably meant to convey a social contrast. It indicated the Mawali as " men of -the sticks," that is, as poor devils who could not afford to equip themselves with proper arms (Wellhausen, Opp. 80). But it seems that this social aspect of the name was early forgotten and the name 20 assumed a religious coloring. It is frequently used to designate the Keisaniyya. Thus Agh. XI, 47: " It was Khindif al- Asadi (cf. Comm. 426, where "Khandak" is incorrect) who converted Kuthayyir to the Ihashabiyya doctrine (if oAI)." Kuthayyir was a typical representative of the 25 Keisaniyya. This peculiar idea which makes the use of arms dependent on the arrival of the Mahdi stands in a remarkable contrast to the Messianic conception of the Prophets (Is. 2, 4; Micah 4, 3). Perhaps it reflects the Messianic belief of post-biblical Judaism 30 (adopted also by orthodox Islam), according to which the arrival 1 The same IAth. IV, 207, where the variant LL?ti~ +X: is to be preferred. IAth. denies that the poor equipment gave rise to the name. He gives a different interpretation to the incident. " They were called Khashabiyya, because oa entering Mekka they carried sticks, being reluctant to display swords in the Holy District." Tab.. however, (II, -6953) reports that they threatened Ibn az-Zubeir with their swords. 2 De Goeje in the glossary to Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum, ibidem, maintains that the word is an anachronism at so early a period as al-Mukhtfr. But the general r6le of the Persian element in that movement and the passage in Tab. confirm the genuineness of the name.</page><page sequence="95">Vol. xxix.] The Ileterodoxies of the SUites, etc. 95 of the Messiah will be connected with a series of bloody wars. [63] At any rate, among the parallels between the Jews and the Rawa- fid put into the mouth of ash-Sha'bi (Ikd 269, Comm. p. 1918) appears also the following comparison: "The Jews say, there shall be no fighting for the sake of God until the Messiah, the Expected 5 One, goes forth and a herald from heaven proclaims (his arrival). The Rafida say, there is no fighting for the sake of Allah until the Mahdi goes forth and a rope' descends from heaven." In view of the religious character assigned to the use of wooden weapons, we may, with all due reserve, call attention to the utter- l0 ance of Ibn Saba recorded by Jahiz (Comm. 4316) that Ali " would not die till he would drive you with his stick," the more so, as, quite independently of Jahiz, Zeid. (Comm. 4224) reports the same form of the Shiitic belief "that Ali is alive and has not died, but will drive the Arabs and Persians woith his stick."'15 Perhaps it is not accidental that Kuthayyir, who was a Khashabi (see before) and had just returned from a visit to the neighbor- hood of ar-Radwa, which in the belief of the Keisaniyya was the hiding place of Muhammed b. al-Hanafiyya, "appeared before us leaning on a stick" (Agh. VIII, 33).2 20 - L. 2. On Hisha'm and his book see Text 7422 and Comm. 65 ff. -L. 6. Extremely remarkable is the statement that these adepts of Terror did not even spare one another.

The tendency of all these stories is plain: 5 they are intended as a protest against the later " Exaggerators " by showing that Ali himself rejected them.

He was wounded in the attack on Othman, Tab., ib.; Suyuti, ib. -L. 11. All the authorities quoted throughout this treatise 5 and a great many other writers equally attest that Ali burned some of those who held " exaggerated " notions about him. Most of them connect these "exaggerators" with Abdallah b. Sabaf.1 In spite of this consensus of opinion, the historical character of this narrative is more than doubtful. The histori- 10 ahs proper (Tabari, Masudi, IAth. and the minor ones) are silent on this point. The fact of an auto-da-fe at so early a period is in itself extremely unlikely. The tendency of the story is unmistakable (see p. 996), and the way it is connected with Ibn Saba is satisfactorily explained when we remember the pecu- 15 liar role assigned to this man and his sect by the Muhammedan theologians. Being a Jew, Ibn Sabai was made the scapegoat for all the subsequent heresies in Islam. The name Saba'iyya became synonymous with radical heresy and was applied to heretics who lived long after ' Abdallah b. Sabac.2 Shahr.'s 20 account on Ibn Saba is almost entirely a projection of later doctrines on the founder of Shiism. It is therefore natural that he should figure in an execution of heretics by Ali. I regard this story as an anticipation of the frequent execu- tions of Shiitic sectarians by Khalid al-Kasri and his successor 25YIftsuf b. 'Omar. Ikd 267 characteristically, though uncon- sciously, states this relation: " al-Mugira b. Sa'd (read Sa'id, see p. 7924) was one of the Saba'iyya whom Ali burned at the stake." Mugira, however, was burned by Khalid as late as 119. Similarly IKot. 300, who mentions Mugira immediately after 30 'Abdallah b. Saba and designates him as a Saba1. A striking parallel to our incident and perhaps its prototype is Tab.'s account (III, 418) on the RaTwandiyya who worshipped the Caliph al-Mansfr. "They came forward shouting to Abf See, e. g., IKot. 300; Ikd 267. According to Kashi 70, Ali burned 'Abdallah himself. This, however, is contradicted by all other sources as well as by the facts, see p. 43. 2 Thus al-Kelbi (died 146) is designated as an adherent(% of Ibn SabA, IKhall. No. 645, p. 26. See Comm. 25"1.

The temptation of Jesus consisted in the "guluww" of the Apostles, i. e.,. in their belief in his divinity (comp. p. 1631). The Prophet himself is reported to have com- pared Ali with Jesus who fell a victim to the love of the 10 Christians and the hatred of the Jews (ZDMG. 38, 391). " As for the Rafida, they strongly exaggerate concerning Ali; some of them follow the doctrines of the Christians concerning Christ. They are the Saba'iyya, the followers of 'Abdallah b. Saba, Allah's curse on them." (Ikd 267).2 More thoughtfully15 is this relation between the Ultra-Shiitic and the Christian -doctrines stated by IKhald. I, 358: "The GulAt have trans- gressed the limits of reason and religion by assuming the divinity of these Irnams. As for Ali, he (read XJ4l) is (con- sidered by them) a human being which has assumed the attri- 20 butes of the Deity and (they believe) that God has embodied himself in his human (corporeal) essence.

They claimed to be in possession of his mystic work 2oI"Jafr," see p. 106. Fihr. 186 ult. ascribes to him the belief in the divinity of Ali. But this appears to be corrcct only in so far as he regarded all the Imams as higher Divine beings. According to Shahr. and Isfr. (56b), he claimed prophecy only when Ja'far had withdrawn from him. Zeid. (ib.) however 25 maintains that he asserted his claims only after Ja'far's death, pretending to have beenf designated by him as his successor. 1On Rajla see p. 2$3 ff. 2 See Makr. 3521.-Comp.

Many expected that he would return to life after forty days (comp. p. 2327), asserting that it was not Hallaj who was executed but an enemy of his on whom he had pressed his own features, IKhall. 186, see Comm. 3012.

Interesting in this connection is Yakut's remark (ib.): "ash-Shalmakan is the name of a man; possibly this town derives its name from him. But it is a mistake." He admits, 15 however, that elsewhere this word is found as a personal name, as can be confirmed by a verse of al-Buhturi.

Perhaps this is due to a confusion with the Katib mentioned soon afterwards (Text, p. 70, note 2, 1. 5). The reading L;iJI (note 11) is confirmed by the variant IKhall. No. 186, p. 129. The vast majority of writers, I I. H. quotes him repeatedly as the type of a miracle worker, e. g., Ed.

Is -Masudi VI, 186, On the whole, agrees with this presentation: "When the (news of) the assassination of Ab-f Muslim reached Khorasan and the other mountainous regions, 5 the Khurramiyya (comp. the variants) became agitated. They are the party called Muslimiyya, which believed in Abft Muslim and in his Imamate . . . Some among them were of the opinion that he has not died nor would he ever die until he has appeared and filled the earth with justice." Fihr. 34427 ff. similarly io describes the Muslimiyya as the sect which believed that AbA Muslim was alive ( comp. Comm. 38'3). He men- tions particularly a certain Ishak who acted in Transoxania as Ab-f Muslim's missionary, claiming that the latter was imprisoned in the mountains of ar-Rayy and that he would come forth at a 15 certain time which was known to him only. Makr. 3532 is not correct when he describes the Rizamiyya as the party which passes the Imamate down to as-Saffah and quite separately enumerates among the Raiwandiyya (p. 121 ff.) the Ply? (see footnote below) which transfers the Imamate from as-Saffah to 20 Abft Muslim.2 I See p. 30'?. 2 Makr. 3542 UL.JI, &lt;54 AJ Ego P j also 1. 3, Polio (5l is to be read instead of 4.LS &lt;V-de Sacy LIX connects the RA+J? with AbA Salma, Abft Muslim's general. But then it would be most surprising that Makr. mentions nothing about the worship of Abuf Muslim and that the other sources again mention nothing about Abt Salma. Besides, Abu Salma would scarcely be styled " Sahib ad-Daula." The proposed emendation removes these difficulties. The name of the sect RA )lJI is either to be read kij~.L.+4 (as Masudi and Fihrist have) or to be explained as a con- tracted Nisba for R . x (as Bagd. gives), e. g., , from (,,tJ1 &gt;v~w:, ;5*.M from .+.AJ .A., comp.

Read Rawandiyya (with long a in the first syllable). The name Rawandiyya is generally applied to the people who came in 141 or, according to another version, in 136 or 137, to 1o Hashimiyya, then the capital of the Caliphate, to pay divine homage to the Caliph al-Mansfr, Tab.

This application, however, is correct only in part. Originally, is it seems, the Raiwandiyya were but a political party which assigned the Imamate to the Abbassides, just as other parties assigned it to the Omeyyads or Alides. Masudi repeatedly describes them as the ,*L.9J LxJ, who justified the trans- fer of the Imamate to the Abbassides on the basis of Koran 8, 76 20 and who hired the corruptible al-Jahiz (d. 255/869) to write for them to order the book "Kitab Imamati waladi'l-'Abbas." (Masudi VIII, 56.) The latter fact alone, which brings the Rhwandiyva down to the third century H., suffices to show that the Rawandiyya, at least, chronologically, 25 extend far beyond the ill-fated " guluww " attempt in 141. It was only at a later time that the Rawanidiyya claimed that the Imamate had been transferred to the Abbassides by a written will of Abft Ha'shim, the son of Muhammed b. al-Hanafiyya (Masudi VIII, 58), thus appearing as a branch of the Keisaniyya. 30 Bagd. apparently holds the same view on this matter when, in formulating the orthodox doctrine of the Imamate, he adds (fol. 133a): is&lt;? ?

"2 It was only a small group out of this large party which cherished extravagant ideas and, as the Muhammedan theologians would say, exaggerated concerning the 'Abbassides. This is 1o still evident from Tab.'s statement III, 418'?, that it was a cer- tain man called Ablak who arranged the attempt at the deifica- tion of Mans-fr and "called upon the Rawandiyya to join him," in other words, used an already existing party for his special purposes.' 15 The name of the sect is written R.Lin5) Tab. ib., I. H. and others; X.LX-) Bagd. and Isfr., and 2 Suyifti, Ta'rikh, 263, which the English translator, p. 266 note, unjustifiedly, as will presently be seen, regards as incorrect. For it is the latter variant, reflected as well in the reading of Ed. Y. 20 (our text, note 9) and this page, note 2, which gives us the clue to the origin of the sect. As a matter of fact, the Rawandiyya are unanimously connected by the Arabic authors with the province of Khorasan, which was, as is well known, the centre of the Abbasside propaganda (Masudi VI, 54, Tab. 25 III, 82, 129'%=IAth. V, 383, comp. Abulfeda II, 13). A locality by the name of Rawand, however, is unknown in that province. A place of that name is mentioned by Yakut II, 741 as being in the vicinity of Isbahdn. Accordingly, Dozy, Isi. 242 and Weil, Geschichte der Chalifen II, 38 (the latter quotes i God, may refer to the Prophet ol to Ai. The latter is more prob- able, for Masudi, too, tells us that they made an exception in the case of Ali. 2 Cod. L. a see later. Masudi VI, 26 says rather vaguely: "The Rawandiyya (maintain) that the Imamate is permissible in the Kureish only.." 3The view set forth in the text is in the main anticipated by de Sacy LVI f. who similarly takes Mas'fidi's statement as the point of departure. 4 It is to be regretted that the editor omitted the variations of this name, which he declares (III, 82, note b) to be numerous.</page><page sequence="123">Vol. XxiX.] The Ieterodoxies of the Shiites, etc. 123 also other views, note 1) seek the origin of this sect in that [70 region.

[70] Muslim and professed the extravagant doctrines set forth above; the other, called so after their founder or leader ar-Raiwandi, was a political party for which al-Jahiz as late as in the third century composed his treatise in favor of the Abbasside claims 5 tothe Imamate. Finally, attention may be called to another sect which stands in a peculiar relation to the Rawandiyya. It is a remarkable fact that our sect which, as can be inferred from the above, is by no means insignificant, is mentioned neither by Shahr. nor 10Iji nor Makr. In its stead we find the Rizamiyya, credited with exactly the same views, as have been set forth above as those of the Rawandiyya. And what is even more significant, the Baslamiyya (or Muslimiyya, see p. 119 n. 2), which worshipped Ab-fi Muslim as a Divine incarnation and is counted among the 15Ra'wandiyya (Makr. 353 ult. ,-the only passage in which the name occurs-, Tab. III, 129'%=IAth. V, 383; Bagd. 103b: Hobo 45?1 , X.Ab&gt;JI ;; An ,5&gt;= BAJA), figures in the other sources among the Rizamiyya (p. 118 f.). It is clear that the two sects are intimately connected with one another. One 20feels naturally inclined to take them for one. The difference in the names and their derivations seem to speak against their identity. - L. 15. - See p. 10032 if [71] 71, 1. 1. A great deal of confusion prevails with regard to 25 the name of this sectarian.

The notice is not quite clear, but this much can be inferred from it that there is both and y among 'Abdallah's ancestors who may be responsible for the variations and that the name of the sect does not, at least in this case, necessarily conform with the immediate ancestor of the founder. 1o Very peculiar is the notice Shahr. 113 that after 'Abdallah b. Mu'awiya's death (comp. Text 71's) his adherents believed that his spirit was transferred to "Ishak b. Zeid b. al-Harith al-Ansari. These are the ldrithiyya who permit forbidden things and live the life of one who has no duties imposed oni m him" (comp. de Sacy, II, 593). It would thus seem that the Harithiyya are not identical with the Harbiyya and represent but a later development of the Harbiyya (or Kharbiyya).' 1 Van Vloten is inclined to pronounce the name al-Eharibiyya to suit the metre. This is scarcely permissible considering that the word itself stands in the verse by emendation. The genealogical chain Marta'-Thaur-Mu'a~wiya-al-Ha'rith-Mu- 'a'wiya is found Wilstenfeld.

Abulfeda derives the name from the citadel Nasariyya and places the origin of the sect in the year 2,0/891. Nuseiriyya again is interpreted as a term of con- 35 tempt: " little Christians," ZDMG.

Ntiseir, an adherent of al-Hasan al-'Askari (died 260), the eleventh Imam of the Imamiyya, Text 58 . The Catechism of the Druzes considers the founder of the Nuseiriyya a man named Nuseiri, Blochet 101. 5 The cardinal point of the Nuseiriyya doctrine is the deifi- cation of Ali. This accounts for the fact that they are con- sidered by I. H. an outgrowth of the Saba'iyya.-Ali, they believed, existed before the world was created, Shahr. 144. To the question " who has created us ? " the modern Nuseiriyya cate- lo chism gives the reply: " Ali ", ZDMG. III, 302. In other words, Ali is the Demiurge, see p. 91. They believed in the simulta- neous incarnation of God in a good and evil being (Shahr. 144, Iji 348), more exactly, in seven such 'successive incarnations; see the list of the seven incarnations, ZDMG. III, 303; on the m5 number seven see Index s.v. Seven. This theory strikingly resembles ash-Shalmagani's doctrine of the Addad, p. 1165. Muhammed was Ali's apostle and was sent to bring mankind to his recognition, ZDMG. III, 302. The Nuseiriyya are closely related to the Ishakiyya (p. 102'3). 20 They are mentioned together, Shahr. 143, Iji 21, 348. Yakut III, 275, appears to identify them. He says briefly of ash- Shorta, a district near Wasit, &amp; - i tLHt lt.t Li1sol. ct N; pi. 72, l. 1. Instead of "army" read "district." Xa, pl. [72] Ol .&gt;t, originally " army district," became afterwards a pure 25 geographical designation. The Jordan district with Tiberias as capital corresponds to the Roman province Palestina Secunda (Prof. N6ldeke in a private communication).-I have found no reference to this occupation of Palestine by the Nuseiriyya outside of I. H. 30 - L. 2 ff. Yakut probably refers to the same fact when he say7s, referring to them (II, 338, sub voce Amp) ixL"Yf r,+Uao FUJI - &lt; ,j? The reason for their hatred of Fatima and her children lies probably in their conception of Ali as Divine being, who, as such, can have neither wife nor children. Abu'l 35 Maali 158 enumerates among the GAiiya a sect Azdariyya: "They say that he who was the father of Hasan and Husein was</page><page sequence="128">128 I. Friedlaender, [1908. [72] not the (real) Ali. He was rather a man called Ali al-Azdarl. But the Ali who is an Imam has no children, as he is the Creator." I. H.'s statement contradicts the assertion of Shahr. 1445 (comp. Haarbriicker II, 413), Iji 21, 348, see de Sacy II, 5 559, that the Nuseiriyya (and Ishakiyya) worshipped the chil- dren of Ali as well. The modern Nuseiriyya catechism (ZDMG. III, 305) also recognizes this relationship of Ali in his capacity as man. L. 8. This is a reflex of the belief in Docetism, p. 30. 10 - L. 13. In his polemic against the Saba'iyya, who believe that a devil was killed in Ali's stead, Isfr. 56a uses the same argument: A L. 4K [73] 73, note 2. The addition in L. Br is characteristic of I. H.'s 15 Zahirite standpoint. - L. 3. See Text p. 3411 and Comm. p. 1311 ff. - L. 4. The words enclosed in quotation marks make the impression of a citation from some Sufi author. Perhaps it would have been more correct to translate uI as "one": 20 "one of them adds." - L. 6 f. The name of this Sftfi is Ab-f Sa'id Abt'l-Kheir, as I. H. expressly states, with two kunyas joined together; de Sacy, Journal -des Savants 1821, p. 725 gives the same form of the name.

(VIII, 21) puts it forcibly as well as briefly: " When the enemies of Islam gave up the hope to uproot it by force they 5 took to inventing false traditions."

Ash-Sha'bi, of course, is not responsible for this 1o invidious comparison. The Sunnites in protesting against the Shiitic forgeries found no better spokesman than ash-Sha'bi, who was revered by the Sunna and at the same time known as a Shiite. It must be noted, however, that, according to Isfr. 70b penult., the terttum comiparatio9 is in the analogy between 15 the Rawaifid and the Jews is not the forgery of traditions but "tashbih," the anthropomorphistic conception of God.

TH[E term Rawdd,/ which figures so conspicuously in the literature bearing on Shiism as well as in the texts of Ibn Hazm can lay claim to a long and eventful history. The word has undergone numerous changes and modifications which are sometimes of so fluctuating a nature as to defy all exact defini- tions. In the following an attempt is made-for it cannot be more than an attempt-to trace the principal stages in this development and to classify the various, sometimes contradic- tory applications of this word. Rawdfid, in the collective singular Rdfida,2 occasionally Arfid3 and R fid9n,4 in the singular I~dfid, originally signi- lies "an army, or a military force . . which has deserted its leader" (Lane), in other words "deserters," or "traitors."

The first two examples occur in poetry, the third in rhymed prose. Whether the variant Ujt,6 ?

Historically the name is connected with Zeid, the great- grandson of Ali, the originator of the Zeidiyya. TabarP2 has preserved an elaborate account of the incident to which the word owes its origin. Zeid b. Ali b. al-Husein b. Ali b. Abl Talib had been encouraged by the people of Kufa to assert his claims to the throne of the Omeyyads. Relying on their promises of assist- ance, he organizes in the year 122h an open rebellion which is to take place on a prearranged day in Kufa. The governor Yitsuf b. 'Omar receives timely information and takes energetic measures to nip the rebellion in the bud by getting hold of its organizer. In this moment of danger the leaders of the rebel- lious Kufiotes, who had always been noted for their fickleness of character, gather around Zeid to cross-examine him as to the legitimacy of the first two Caliphs, Abft Bekr and 'Omar. IIZeid' said: 'May Allah have mercy on them both and grant them forgiveness! I have never heard anyone, of my family repudiating them4 or speaking of them otherwise than favor- 'The Shiites never designate themselves as Rawafid. According to Mukaddasi (p. 142, n. 6), they apply this word to their opponents. As-Sayyid protests against the affront implied in it (p. 140, n. 3). The expression has, it seems, always (see, however, p. 151, n. 5) carried with it a derogatory meaning. The term Mu'tazila, " secessionists" or "schismatics ", affords, both as regards origin (see Shahr. 8331 and the other sources) and subsequent development, an interesting parallel to Rawafid. The Mu'tazila themselves prefer the designation Ashdb (or ahl) al-'adl wa't-tau-Jid (Shahr. 29 bottom, cf. preceding note, and Zeid. Mu'taz. p. 2). Bagd. 40, 1377a uses the word polemically; A s ji , while Zeid.

They said: 'Why, then, do you seek the blood of this family (the Omeyyads), if they have not (illegally) seized upon your throne and wrenched it from your hands?' He replied to them: 'The most I can admit in the question you are discuss- ing. is that we (the family of Ali) were the worthiest among men of the Prophet's throne and that the people appropriated it in preference to us and pushed us away from it. Yet, this, in our opinion, does not constitute apostasy on their part. They' were Caliphs, they were just in their dealings with the people and acted in accordance with the Book and Tradition.' They said: 'If those did not wrong you, then these (the Omey- yads) have not wronged yoti either. Why, then, shotild you call (us) to fight people who are not doing you any wrong?' He answered: 'These here are not the same as those. These *here do wrong me and you and themselves. For we only call you to Allah's Book and the Prophet's Tradition (so that) the traditions be revived and the innovations extinguished. If you follow us, you will be blessed. If not,-I am not responsible for you !' Thereupon they withdrew from him, violating their oath of allegiance, and declared: 'the Imam has died !2, hence- forward maintaining that Abft Ja'far Muhammed b. Ali, the brother of Zeid b. Ali, was the (legitimate) Imam. The latter, however, had died in the meantime, but his son Ja'far b. Muhammed was alive. So they declared: 'Ja'far is now our Imam after his father. He is the worthiest of the Imamate after his father. We will not follow Zeid b. Ali, for he is no Imam.' Zeid thereupon called them Rdficda. At present,' however, they maintain that it was al-Mukiira who called them _Rdftd~a at the time when they had withdrawn from him." The last sentence is highly significant. The partisans of Zeid apparently repented their faithless action which resulted 'Abui Bekr and 'Omar. It is not clear whether 'Othman is included.

Shrewd as they were, they pre- tended that this name was hung on them by al-Mugfra b. Sa'Id' under whom they had risen shortly before and from whom they had betimes withdrawn.2 To have been thus nicknamed by so rank a heretic constituted, in their opinion, a title of honor.3 Tabar'1s derivation of the word from the unfortunate upris- ing of Zeid b.

It is well known that historical incidents quoted by Muhamme- dan authorities for the purposes of philological interpretation cannot always be relied upon, as they are not infrequently man- ufactured for the occasion. But no such scepticism is justified in our case. Tabari's report is derived from AbP Aiikhnaj; who was a contemporary of Zeid, lived in the same city and is the best authority for the early history of Islam, especially in 'IrAk.' Besides, the incident has every internal evidence in its favor. Zeid b. Ali was the pupil of Waisil b. 'Ata, the founder of the ilu'tazila.' Like the latter, he looked at the problem of the Imamate from a rational point of view.' To Zeid and his followers the Zeidiyya the Imamate was essentially a question of personal qualification.6 They denied the existence of a written will7 and, while maintaining the superiority of Ali, they justly enough admitted that the first two eminently successful Caliphs were legitimate rulers.8 To Zeid's opponents the Imamate was exclusively a question of birth. It was heredi- tary in its very nature and bequeathed to Ali by the Prophet. Accordingly, Abft Bekr and 'Omar were usurpers and, dis- regarding, as they did, the express will of Allah's Prophet, I Who also quotes the other explanation, p. 142, n. 6. 2 See p. 142, n. 6. 3See on this historian Wellhausen, Das arabische Reich, Preface. 4 See Comm. 1136. 5 Corp.

Thus the " repudia- tion of the two Eiders" became the equivalent and complement of the recognition of the claims of the Alids. It was the pro- pelling force of all Shiitic uprisings and it is but natural that the same question formed the point of issue between the legiti- mists of Kufa and the rationalistic and fair-minded Zeid at the moment when they were both about to take up arms against the ruling dynasty. Thus we may consider it certain that the word Rawdfted originated in Kufa in the year of the Hijra 122,2 in connection with the rebellion of Zeid b. Ali.3 The specific characteristic of the Rawalfid, of those who deserted Zeid and were termed by him "deserters," was the negative attitude towards Ab-t Bekr and 'Omar, and, in a lesser degree, of 'Othman and the other Companions,4-an attitude which was not a mere theoretic notion but soon grew into vio- lent hatred and vented itself in the action-believed to be meritorious-of OJ I t "the public denunciation of the Companions."

"to act as Rdfida " became the designation for this hostile attitude toward the " two Elders " and the Companions, Rawdfidl and its .paral- lel forms the name of those who maintain this attitude.6 Thus lSee Introd. 22 and Text 7918. 2 Ash-Sha'bi's (died 103) reference to the RAfiUa (Comm. p. 1916) is no doubt apocryphal. This scathing criticism of the RAfida is attributed to him purposely because he was known to be favorably inclined towards Shiismn. The sentence quoted ibidem 1920 0 J I Hi' \O is attributed Isfr. 15a to the Prophet himself, whilst accord- ing to ash-Sha'lbi (see p. 1443), the Rawafiq were even worse than the Jews. Again, according to Shahr. 9, the Prophet compared the RawAfi&amp; with the Christians. 3 Whether Zeid gave his opponents that name or it was given to them by others in connection with that event is quite immaterial to us. 4 Cf. p. 139. n. 1. 5 On " Sabb" see Goldziher, Shi'a 455 ff. and ZDMG. 36, 280. For some very characteristic instances see Comm. 28, n. 1 (quotation from Mirza), 424 ff., 651 ff. and Goldziher, Shi'a 456 middle. 6 This, in our opinion, accounts for the additional explanation of "RawafiW" as ,X I,&lt;K LA as those who deserted Abft Bekr and 'Omar, so Ikd (cf. p. 148).

We are thus presented with three derivations of the name: 1) according to the Shiites, the name applies to those who gave the precedence to someone else over Ali in the Cal- iphate, i. e. who elected Abui Bekr (and 'Omar) instead of Ali. 2) Accord- ing to the Zeidiyya, it applies to those who rejected Zeid's Caliphate (in 1212), 3) According to the others (i. e. the Sunnites), Rawafidi are those who rejected the Caliphate of Abi Bekr and 'Omar. Historically, the first and third explanation are identical: they both assign an earlier ori- gin to the name, deriving it from the events following Muhammed's death. They are substantially identical with the second explanation quoted by Makrizi. The second derivation of Mukaddasi assigns the name to the year 122. This explanation is, according to Mukaddasi, the original one, while the third, although the ordinary one, is apocryphal. From the expositions in the text it will have become obvious why the latter explanation had become so favorite. From the remark above quoted we also learn the fact-otherwise unknown-that the Shi'a, in this case the Im"amiyya, see later p. 158,-applied the same nickname to their adversaries. This apparently means that the RawAfid, smart- ing under the offence implied in that term (comp. p. 140), endeavor to explain it differently: i. e. as those who deserted Ali, the opposition to Ali being objectionable even in the eyes of many Sunnites.-Another example of a polemical explanation of Rawaifid is found in a hadith (apocryphal, of course) quoted Isfr. 15b penult: (sic) ? wv&gt;. 2 Jl Li ; &amp;ar- WI La 1 .x tx tA</page><page sequence="144">144 I.

Di'bil retorts: "I have never seen anyone more stupid than thyself, except the one who hath appointed thee ... . Thy mind can conceive that I am a RaIidi because of calumniating Safiyya the daughter of 'Abd al-Muttalib . . . Is calumniating ~a~fyya a religious tenet of the Rafida ?'" Di'bil shrewdly implies that other personalities, far more important than Safiyya, are the target of the Rawafid's hatred. Because of this " denunciation of the Companions" the Rawafid are nicknamed " Sabbablin," "denouncerss." a 2 To realize the full significance of this usage, we must bear in mind the fact so lucidly expounded by Goldziher,' that the Shi'a t Cf.

While travelling in 'JraJk, where there are "Ghliya, exaggerating their love for Mu'awiya" (p. 126, 1. 14 and note rn; cf. Comm. 128), our author hears in the principal mosque of Wasit a man reciting a Iadith (forged, of course) in favor of Mu'awiya. He remonstrates. The man shouts &lt;5Y, I.&gt; 1 and the mob advances to attack him (p. 126). Similarly, in Ispahan, which is equally distinguished by its " Guluww for Mu'awiya" (cf. also Goldziher, Shi'a 495, n. 3) the author protests against a man who denounces Ali and is angrily pointed at as Be) Len j (p. 39913). This does not necessarily imply that "orthodoxi fana- tici . I vocant quoque orthodoxos moderates " (Glossary to Mukad-. dasi s.v. U v)), but simply means that the people seeing that he objects to Mu'Awiya or that he defends Ali, think that he is a " repudia- tor " of the Companions. In point of fact, Mu1kaddasi is very favorably inclined toward the Zeidiyya (see p. 158). 3 ZDMG. 36, 280 f., 50, 111 f., Shi'a 460 ff, Muh. St. II, 110 f. Cf. Snouck-Hurgronje, Meicka I, 33. VOL.

Shiism (Tashayyu') in itself, i. e. attachment to Ali and the Alidic family, is, from the Sun- nitic point of view, by no means objectionable, nay, is even commendable; the word Shi'a in itself does not imply any heresy.' It does become objectionable when the attachment to Ali is coupled with the denunciation of the Companions, in the first place of Abif Bekr and 'Omar.2 Hence, even in later times, Radtfid is frequently. used side by side with and at the same time as distinguished from S~hi'a, the former denoting the radi- cal and improper expression of Alidic sympathy, the latter the moderate and permissible one. Thus Ibn Hajar al-'Askelani (died 852/1449) characteristically says3: &gt;kA6 L_ ?

A further instane may be added from IKhald. III, 74. Speaking of the later Sfrfls, Ibn 'The hadith is shrewdly enough transmitted through the son of 'Omar. 2 Goldziher, Shi'a 444; quotes a liadith which is obviously identical with ours.

In the latter form the Prophet also protests against those who, like the Zeidiyya, acknowledge Abfi Bekr and 'Oinar but reject the other Companions. 3 In this passage the author (a Persian Shiite of the eleventh century of the Hijra) incidentally explains the origin of the word jL*^ i)(or, as he spells it, x cf. 137 n. 2) in a manner different from the explana- tions previously quoted.

It was for this reason that they (apparently referring to the people mentioned at the beginning of the quotation) were called Shi'a and Rafida." Shi'a= partisans of Ali. Rafida seemns to convey to the author's mind an essentially positive meaning: intense devotion to the Alidic family, while originally this meaning was merely the complement of the negative idea: the repudi- ation of the Companions.</page><page sequence="148">148 I.

Their antipodes within the Shi'a were the Zeidiyya, the followers of Zeid b. Ali. JHence Rawdfid very aptly became the equivalent for Imdnmiyya.- In this application our term is consistently used by Zeiditic and very frequently by Sunnitic writers. Thus a Zeidite writes y.AS yl;.tJt V IJt. The early Zeidite al-Kasim b. Ibrahim (died 246') applies the word in the same manner, e. g., Comm. 10428, similarly Zeid. Mutaz., p. 48. The Zeidite Suleiman b. Jarir (see Comm. p. 722?) ai~l J a " criticized the Rafida," i. e. the Ima'miyya (Shahr. 119).

As synonymous with Imamiyya the word also appears Text 6216; (Comm. 144", 152; Ed. IV, 100 f. and elsewhere. It is only a slight variation of this usage when I.

However bitterly the former resented the Imamiyya's attitude towards the Companions, they still regarded them as being within the fold of Islam.7 Excluded from the Muhammedan community were only the Gult or GAliya,8 who were considered 'See Comm. p. 10425. 2 Another explanation is possible, see p. 152, n. 4. 3 One must. however, bear in mind that under the Fatimides the "repudiation" of the first Caliphs became obligatory as a state law, cf. Goldziher, Shi'a 456. 4 IBab., Ithbat 38. 5lb. 41. It is worthy of notice that al-Hasan is so designated by one of his admirers (although not a Shiite).

Often enough it is impossible to distinguish it from the usages enumerated before, the " Exaggerators " being at the same time " Repudiators." 1 Besides, the Galiya never became an independent organism as did the Iinamiyya. The constituency of the Galiya is as fluctuating as is the name, which only later and even then not uncontestedly became the technical term for Ultra Shiites.2 At any rate, the cases in which Rawai- fid appears as a synonym of Galiya are counterbalanced by the examples in. which they are distinctly kept asunder.

I have found no reference testifying to a particular scrupulousness of the Shiites as regards wine drinking. On the contrary, certain Shiitic sects and individuals are accused of transgressing this prohibition (cf.

This argument, which is directed against the descendants of Fatima, affects the Zeidiyya as well as the Imamivva.4 Ibn Hazm seems to refrain from this unrestricted use of the word.

In distinction from Rawdftd, the term Shi'a has nothing objectionable or derogatory about it3: the Shiites themselves unhesitatingly assume this appellation.4 To the Sunnites as well, owing to the ever increasing prevalence of pro-Alidic senti- ments among the masses,' Shi'a even in the sense of "Shi'at 'Au" conveys no objectionable meaning,-this, as it were, respect- able character of the word being, in our opinion, the main reason for the gradual spread of Raw4fdi'l at its expense. The application of ASkti'a by the Sunnites, just as that of Raw4al- fid, is largely conditioned by their attitude towards the Zeid- iyya. The disagreement between the Sunna and Zeidiyya is not one of deep-seated antagonism. In point of fact, the whole difference reduces itself to the question as to the candi- dacy for the Imamate. According to the Zeidiyya, the Imamate is confined to the descendants of Fatima0; the Suninites extend it to the whole of Kureish. Since, however, the Sunnites for the most part agree with the Zeidiyya as to the excellence of ' Cf. also Comm. 215.

Ali and his family, and the Zeidiyya, on the other hand, agree with the Sunnites as to the legitimacy of the two Elders, the gap between them seems practically to close. ".'The Zeidiyya," says Makr. 3547, " are the best among the Shi 'a, for they admit the Imamate of Abfi Bekr and deny the existence of a written will concerning the Imamate of Ali." This stands to reason why Mukaddasi, e. g., places the Zeidiyya outside the Shi'a, apply- ing the latter term to the Imamiyya and other radical sections of the Shi'a. Thus p. 38 n. d (see above p. 142 n. 6): Ls R.JI 4X4 n . . FUJ I, or p. 3711 .2 i Xn " the Shi'a prevailed upon the Zeidiyya," or p. 1281 The " stupid Shiites " can only refer to the Imamiyya and other radical sections,' as the Zeidivya, on the whole, refrain from attacking the four Caliphs.2 It is nothing but a different consequence of the same attitude of mind when, on the contrary, we find that the term Shi'a, with- out any objectionable by-meaning,3 is applied to the Zeidiyya, to the eXchtsion of the Iidnmiiyya who are designated as Rawca- fid. This is clearly the case with the utterance of Ikd, p. 1484 and the hadith p. 146 (cf. p. 147 n. 2). It may also be applic- able in the phrase RjIt xAJX , of which several examples were quoted p. 147 f., notably so in the case of IKhald. p. 148. With the rise within the Zeidiyya of sections which, unfaith- f ul to their founder, did not refrain from the " denunciation of the Companions,"6 the attitude of the Sunna became one of hostility and the term Shi'a, gradually assuming a distinct 1 This is clearly shown by the variant (note a) JAiL Le .Q&lt; K;&gt;80 &gt;5k;61RJ 4J!&gt; LW05 .JuI V.

Lastly, mention must be made of a term used by the Shiites for the same polemical purposes as was Rawidficl by the Sunnites. We refer to the expression XNwsi4b, which seems to have been patterned after BRawa&lt;dftd. 2 Ample information about the mean- ing and history of this designation can be drawii from Gold- ziher's writings.3 Originally Xawdsib stood for the exact reverse of Rawafid: the "enemies" or "haters" (of Ali),4 and was confined to the extreme Kharijites. Gradually its meaning expanded so that it finally embraced all Sunnites, however far they were from hating Ali. In addition we may remark that the Infamiyya polemically apply the same term even to the Zeidiyva, with whom the superiority of Ali is a cardinal doctrine.
