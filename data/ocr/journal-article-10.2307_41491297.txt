<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dispositio Vol. XI, Nos. 28-29, pp. 179-218 ©Department of Romance Languages, University of Michigan A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST* Félix Schwartzmann Universidad de Chile ABSTRACT The history of self-knowledge, developed within the complex weft on which attempts at knowing oneself are woven, represents history in a global sense. Histories of historiography as a science, histories of cultures, civilizations or societies, generally reveal as many limitations as those histories which do not take into account the reality and configurational meaning of forms of self- knowledge. Even though some historians have recognized that the autobiography always constitutes a piece of universal history, they have failed to describe the ways in which knowledge of oneself has been attained in the past. To be precise, from the oracle of Delphi, and its imperative to attain self-knowledge, via Saint Augustine, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Rousseau, to Dostoevski, Nietzsche, Stendhal, Baudelaire, Rilke or Freud, every method which has aspired to attain self- knowledge has reflected the spirit of the age which gave rise to such attempts. The psychiatrist L. Binswanger is correct when he states that Western man begins when Heraclitus proclaims: "I have investigated myself." It is true that scholars such as Georg Misch have written histories of the autobiography, but they do not point to a view of the world, of the theory of human nature which underlies each and every imperative or desire to attain self-knowledge. History, as a science, either falls back on religious, social, economic, or political conditionings, or postulates cycles * Translated by Henry Lowick-Russell T. Professor University of Chile, English Department.</page><page sequence="2">180 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN cultural spirits, etc... In any event, it seems to be taken for granted that anthropological reference to self-knowledge is for the psychologist but not for the historian. Similar demarcation impoverishes historical knowledge to a great extent. For all sectorial histories, not only the history of art and literature, in fact became more intelligible once the idea of man and, correlatively, the form of self-knowledge which leads support to human action qualitatively diverse in Socrates, Dostoevski, Proust, Whitman or Neruda. On the other hand, the agonizing confession of how man has never been so enigmatic is typical in the present epoch. It is proclaimed by Max Scheler, M. Heidegger, the ecologist Tinbergen, or Freud. Neither was the acknowledgement of the enigmatic in man foreign to the nineteenth century, as is shown in the analyses of Goethe and Nietzsche, who maintain that of all beings man is the most remote from himself. Now, we are living at the beginning of a microelectronic revolution, in which types of computers and robots follow one another at a rate which dangerously surpasses evolutionary, biological rhythms. Even now we can perceive on the horizon a world of co-existence, populated with informative creations, and we talk of the age of the robot. And this is not merely an example, but rather a crucial fact in the history of mankind. The invention of a variety of fantastically differentiated automata and, likewise, the enterprising research into problems of artificial intelligence have become an urgent necessity for survival due to the internal logic peculiar to the present technological revolution. And this gives rise to the great problem: we need to know ourselves so that the invention of the different conceivable forms of artificial intelligence may be possible. It is necessary to study the identification of forms, the varied understanding of the tone of voice of a friend, etc... That is to say, it seems imperative to develop a technology of knowledge (not just a theory of knowledge in the classical sense, which implies understanding, for example, the subtle structures which make possible understanding the brain from what learning implies, and, in turn, which cerebral structure conditions scientific discourse). Thus we are witnessing the development of a search for technological self-knowledge. In other words, it is necessary to know oneself in order to create artificial forms of intelligence. Thus we are seeing how in the new era attempts to attain self-knowledge are associated with the history of scientific-technological development. The final chapters of the book deal with the paradoxes and problems which this involves. The book is accompanied by an index, which enables the reader to fit the published fragments within the frame of the work to which they belong. Also, the Prologue will be an appropriate synthesis of the theme of the book. Finally, I must add, that some passages on the self-portrait and self-knowledge, were published in my Theory of Expression (Barcelona; Seix Barral, 1967).</page><page sequence="3">A HISTORY OF SELF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 1 8 1 INTRODUCTION The Eagle soars in the summit of Heaven, The Hunter with his dogs pursues his circuit, О perpetual revolution of configured stars, О perpetual recurrence of determined seasons, О world of spring and autumn, birth and dying! The endless cycle of idea and action, Endless invention, endless experiment, Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness; Knowledge of speech, but not of silence; Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word. All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance, All our ignorance brings us nearer to death, But nearness to death no nearer to GOD. T. S. Elliott, The Rock, 1934 I. On utopias and paradoxes History reveals that the imperatives that man establishes as life norms turn out to be utopias that sometimes adopt the outline of an existential paradox. Such is the case of the Delphic oracle and of the Socratic imperative. Because man, until his death, lives closer to an unknown than to anyone else. Ever since ancient times philosophers, politicians and psychologists have known that the individual is the remotest being from his own self and that, also on occasion, other men know him better in some aspects than he does himself. From there that fluctuations in state of mind, hesitations in conduct, repentances, contradictions, such as not clearly knowing what one wants, dominate our way of living. We are frequently bowed down by the impotence of not finding a clear answer to the questions we ask ourselves in the dialogue of the soul with itself, which is</page><page sequence="4">182 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN philosophy, according to Plato. This continuous process of philosophyzing often leads to impotence, to the painful hermeneutical limitations that hinder self- knowledge. We live together with an unknown who tortures us: it is the certaintly of not knowing ourselves. We shall see that this turns out to be highly fruitful in the process of knowledge of the deep history of man in his history. We thus see how Montaigne is the true master of Descartes. Above all, when Montaigne coins an order of intimate certainties vis-à-vis the unlimited multiplicity of changing instants he describes. It is what he qualifies as the human monstruosity. But these certainties culminate in a metaphysical, ontological conjecture: the deduction of thinking that one exists. Yes. It is a method that Descartes develops and which will decisively influence the origin of mechanicism. But we see at once that the cogito supplies the certainty of existing, but not of how we are. Shakespeare, in a different way also heir to Montaigne, will tell us that "we know what we are, but not what we may be ", ( Hamlet , Act IV, Sc. 5, 1.41). Neither do we know much concerning others, because in order to do so, Shakespeare points out "but to know a man well were to know himself' ( Hamlet , Act. V, Sc. 2, 1 . 143). Here the paradox is inverted, though it continues to be the utopia that affects all acts. From where, in Shakespeare's view, "Our wills and fates do so contrary run, That our devices still are overthrown, Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own - ( Hamlet , Act III, Sc. 2, lines 210-13) Man is a being that lives and shares with an unknown. He is the creator of utopias and of universes. His impotence when facing himself, when facing self-delusion, frequently moves him to forge illusions about himself and to do what he does not want to do, causing himself pain. This constitutes a basic dimension of the cultural history of man. II Semblance of the times The purpose of this work is to find a common source, the originary assumption we need in order to understand natural and human sciences. This, without postulating any kind of reductionism or physicalism. For centuries man has been thinking about the unity of sciences, (Leibniz), or of a "unified science", in the sense stated by O. Neurath and R. Carnap during the first decades of the twentieth century. A century ago, W. Dilthey classified them into Natural Sciences and Sciences of the Spirit. Developing this last one, Dilthey and some historians searchingly outlined and differenciated epoch styles, elaborating pre-</page><page sequence="5">A HISTORY OF SELF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 183 cise and subtle correspondences between the different forms of cultural creati- vity. They established unity within diversity, concerning types of knowledge systems and subsystems in which, for example, the relations between individual basic animator, the subjective disposition, the primordial mental attitude of the historical periods investigated. In short, they did not adumbrate the common anthropological root of the categories of representation of creations and ways of living. They outlined the unity of the spirit of the Renaissance, e.g., the analogies between the different tendencies of art, poetry and the sciences. Nonetheless, that expressive unity continues to be a mystery as regards what engenders that harmonic constellation of the objectified spirit. Nowadays we may empirically establish the correspondence or contemporaneity between Picasso, Joyce, Rilke, Mondrian, Husserl and Witgenstein, on the one hand, and of Planck, Einstein or Bohr on the other. Which differs widely from the possibility of verifying how the Titanism of Montaigne, which he made use of in his self-analysis, in some way conditioned the development of the method of Descartes, who was a true disciple of Montaigne, as shown by A. Koyré. In the same way, Montaigne not only had a decisive influence on Shakespeare, but also on the development of mechanicism through Descartes. Furthermore, we may verify how "Phyrrhonism", in the peculiar sense that Montaigne understood it, exerted a lasting influence in the West, in relation with a type of self-knowledge. In this work we shall deal with these and other like genealogies of knowledge. Ill Periods of the historical world The times we know as great epochs in world history present, as one of their most outstanding characteristics, profound contradictions. Whether they are periods of "grandeur" or of cultural "crisis", they are enigmatic epochs in which a series of complex tensions threaten the balance of their modes of living. In our times, what is revealed as contradictory has perhaps no precedents. Because it so happens that it is forms of knowledge, of a knowledge judged for thousands of years as being the highest manifestation of the spirit, that expose us, if not to extinction, to the loss of harmony in the relations of an individual with himself, the other and nature. In other words, it is made clear to man that he must struggle facing greater risks than primitive man, who lived an inhospitable environment; today he discovers that he must conciliate his very creativity, the technosphere created by him, with inner autonomy. Furthermore, at the same time that science is defied, those who advance diverse fields of study proclaim that man has never before been such a mysterious being to himself. As we will show in the corresponding chapter, that is what is being said by scientists, philosophers, biologists, ethnologists, sociologists and historians. There are thinkers who doubt or who deny that sociology is at present a</page><page sequence="6">184 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN science having lost the contents proper to it while developing a framework of systems and subsystems in which, for example, the relations between individual and society may not be studied through the use of traditional methods. In this sense, it is then understandable that it is being found necessary to elaborate a new psychology adequate enough for the future "living-together" with the robot. And we should not be surprised at the query whether society actually exists in the secular sense. We hear speak about the death of the love discourse, of the metaphysical sense of the absence and presence of the other. For the same reason, the study of our fellow being's experience constitutes a basic problem that is taken up from varied perspectives. Some words have even been written whose central theme is the crisis of western sociology. Alvin Gouldner tries to bring about the renewal and development of a "reflexive" sociology aiming at self- consciousness in depth, at the knowledge of one's self, as we have done for decades. Somber and multiple uncertainties distressingly loom in the horizon of our expectations, and even the idea of natural law and the concept of "scientific truth" are used with restraint and are problematized. We think that what Albert Einstein wrote in 1937 is symbolically representative of these anxieties of man in present times: Our time is distinguished by wonderful achievements in the fields of scientific understanding and the technical application of those insights. Who would not be cheered by this? But let us not forget that knowledge and skills alone cannot lead humanity to a happy and dignified life. Humanity has every reason to place the proclaimers of high moral standards and values above the discoverers of objective truth. What humanity owes to persons like Buddha, Moses and Jesus ranks for me higher than all the achievements of the enquiring and constructive mind. What these blessed men have given us we must guard and try to keep alive with all our strength if humanity is not to lose its dignity, the security of its existence, and its joy in living. It is likewise significative that the biologist Lewis Thomas (in The Medusa and the Snail , pp. 174-8, 1980) should urge us to learn from our ignorance. But whichever be the false perspectives, the illusions or fallacies that our contemporary age conditions or masks, it is a fact that the most somber features come to light within the sphere of human relations. We observe that man begins to conceive of close-living-together as a utopia . Moreover, it appears as a tragic utopia . this being so, what is revealing is that these terms do not interfere with each other, nor do they fall into semantic contradictions. On the contrary. It is true that the spirit of language resists associating them, as taken in isolation they appear to be unyielding to assimilation. Because what is Utopian implies the aspiration to surpass wounding</page><page sequence="7">A HISTORY OF SELF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 185 antagonisms, pointing at the idyllic. Nonetheless, when one lives and reflects on the negative effects of development, it may be perceived how these notions may enter into resonance, thus introducing modifications in the sense of one and another. Because, despite the fact that the encounter with another, in free and open reciprocity, without intermediaries, represents a wish, a psychological- ethical need difficult to elude, other social tendencies predominate. They are the ones that confine to intimate exile, to resentment in front of those who are seen as living a common destiny. We may then speak with propriety of tragic utopia, of living-together as utopia. That is, we observe the singular paradox of a "real dream" which, applied to social togetherness, is at times perceived as unattainable, inherent as it is to human nature. Thanks to this selfsame apparent contradiction, this sheds light on the most exact anticipation, but of a future that we must avoid. We have also been writing for decades that the curve of happening of the coming years will show, even more painfully, to what extent there exists an essential metaphysical antagonism between, on the one hand, longing of reality, immediacy of interhuman ties and, on the other, mediatized togetherness and a proclivity to fall off a cliff into impersonal barbarism. IV. The Problem There exists in the cosmos a being from whose possibilities of self- knowledge depend his image of immediate reality, of the other and of the universe. That is to say, changing models of universe are derived from the variations of his forms of self-knowledge. The adequate interpretation of the course of history reveals how it is always possible to discover or establish correspondences between said self-knowledge and the systems that make up social and cultural styles of living. Because it so happens that the history of self-knowledge manifests itself as being threefold, as a polyphony in which are harmonized the knowledge of one's self, of the other and of the world. Therefore, we are dealing here with an intellectual history, nor with a history of ideas, or narration surrounding autobiographies, in the style of the classical work of Georg Misch. Far from it, we are interested in following the historical course starting from the analysis of the mystery of the presence of the other, just as it is actualized in interpersonal relations. And if we touch upon the changing conceptions of the universe, what will interest us essentially is the mystery of knowledge, in the sense that Einstein established the primacy of the enigma of knowledge vis-àvis the enigma of being. Neither is this, thus, a psychological study in the restricted sense of the term. By this we signify what Dostoievski understood when he denied being a psychologist; that is why he admits that he tries to understand man starting from man, that is, struggling to see the soul in its boundless mystery. At this point, we must state that we follow a tradition that goes back to the philosopher Heraclitus (in whom the psychiatrist L. Binswanger sees the</page><page sequence="8">186 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN appearance of western man); it is a tradition that we adopt because it does not exclude the variability of content and links between the concepts originally visualized by Heraclitus. It is opportune here to bear in mind the philosophical revolution brought about by this Greek thinker: he proclaims that he has investigated within his self, but that it is impossible to know the soul in all its unfathomable scope, so deep, he thinks, is the logos that penetrates and governs the cosmos. Admitting such a conception, we shall study the sense of self-knowledge in Socrates, Saint Augustine and Montaigne, passing through Shakespeare and Pascal, down to Rousseau, Goethe, Nietzsche, Dostoievski, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Freud, Rilke, Válery, Artaud, Lacan and others. I consider it necessary to insist that the points established above do not imply a history of the Delphic imperative to know one's self. The thinkers and facts mentioned are investigated insofar as their modes of self-reference shed light on the cultural-historical surroundings in which they developed, at the same time that the historical happenings and world image are interpreted and discovered as an inseparable whole that implies the inner experience. We attempt, besides, to show how the originary astonishment of man emerges out of the primordial astonishment when facing what is experienced as something called the self. So that we consider admiration when facing oneself as the origin of all hermeneutics, psychological, physiognomical, aesthetic or historical. (And it is opportune here to remember that to Descartes, astonishment "admiration" is the first of all passions.) In relation with science and the "observer" we will describe some "cases" that clearly serve to illustrate the understanding of the role of self-knowledge in scientific discourse. Einstein, e.g., in his valuation of anthropomorphism conceived it as necessary and insurmountable, and the acknowledgment of Dostoievski as his master; N. Bohr and his confession of intellectual debt as regards the self-analysis of the novelist Moller and philosopher Kierkegaard; and, lastly, E. Schrödinger, one of the creators of quantic physics, and his conception of the observer inspired in E. A. Poe. On the other hand, we consider it fundamental to investigate the anthropological meaning of the unvarying and unlimited in this endless historical process of self-diagnosis, from Pindar down to present-day poetry. We consider as unvarying the fact that in any attempt at self-knowledge, this is evidenced, paradoxically, in that one stumbles against insurmountalbe limits. In other words, the act of knowing one's self and the simultaneous ignorance of it turn out tobe complementary opposites. Of course, the perception of such limitations is always relative to the historical prospective style of Montaigne; diverse, too, is the mode of self-diagnosis in the tragical doubt of Shakespeare, in special when he dramatizes the countenance as a mask. Nietzsche, on his part, conceives self-analysis as being mediatized by historical valuations and biologically conditioned. It is understood that in this complementarity, in reaching the ignorance of one's self in the act of knowing</page><page sequence="9">A HISTORY OF SELF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 187 one's self, it is unvarying as such complementarity, but variable as to the modes of expression which are lived, based on the forms of self-knowledge. Throughout this investigation we shall attempt to show in what sense what we state above constitutes a clue to delve deeper into the meaning of the so-called human nature and the historical fate of man. From where, lastly, arises at the same time the great question and problem: in the new era, in the new times of cosmotropism, computation and the robot, in the new philosophies and forms of life and art, what style of self-knowledge will there develop? The countercultural movements whose spirit was already anticipated by Goethe in his resistance to Newtonian science, denote a will towards re-pristinization that hints at new inclinations in man facing himself and everything it implies. We therefore undertake the study of the arduous anthropo- historical problem of how the mode of self-analysis originating in an individual and in a society becomes universal. Because we must not forget that historians rightly consider that all autobiography is a segment of universal history. Analogously, but concerning other matters, Neitzsche affirms that the great problem is how Homer so soon became "pan-Hellenic". And we might add, among other possible examples, the unity of Renaissance style in Cardano, Benvenuto Cellini, Leonardo or Galileo. Lastly, insofar as the styles of expression in the history of art and in interhuman relations reveal a certain degree of self-knowledge, we shall investigate expressivity in Buddhist art. We shall see how we find here the three pathways we differenciated above, the expressive conciliation of reference to oneself, the other and the universe. Further, it is convenient to emphasize a fact that teaches something about the restlessness of our times. It so happens that the complexity of life in postindustrial society is also manifested and reflected in the multiplicity of investigations on the culture of the encounter and concerning problems of interhuman relations in general. In fact, during the last years, in philosophy, psychiatry, psychology, ethnology and philosophical anthropology, the theme of self-knowledge and the other one stand out revealingly. There even is an important bibiography concerning friendship and relations with others in philosophy and poetry in antiquity. In short, our purpose is to raise the analysis of the history of self-knowledge in the West to heuristic principle in order to more deeply establish the conceptual genealogy of natural and human sciences. In other words, this work is not only a history of ideas, nor the narration of intimate experiences concerning the knowledge of one's self. It is rather, an attempt to answer the question: " What is Man?". We set about such an endeavour starting from the investigation of the anthropological meaning of the historical variability of the concrete cultural forms of self-knowledge. So that these modes are studied as ideas, as aspirations, desire to know one's self and actual experiences lived within a determined social context. This book may thus contribute, to a certain extent, through the investigation</page><page sequence="10">188 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN of present modes of astonishment vis-à-vis ourselves and the you, to an understanding and anticipation of the world that the generation of the Third Millennium will face, thanks to the knowledge of the sense of individual and collective experiences in present civilization. V. The Sense of Self-Knowledge in Saint Augustine We may establish a periodification of cultural changes according to the forms of self-knowledge that predominate in different societies, in special when said expressions of self-gnosis are manifested through inner tensions of doubt and certainty. Because it is as if such oscillations between the experience of a knowledge and a certain type of skepticism constituted the fruitful source of visions and systems, of images of man and of methods to know the world. This is what is revealed to us by the life and experiences of Socrates, Augustine, Montaigne or Rousseau. The great periods of transition in history find expression, in what refers to the experiences revealed to the inner look, in a particular counterpoint between lucidity and enigmatic inner perceptions. The historian Jacob Burkhardt specifies that the "new directions of history derive their essential strength out of unfathomable depths". That soundless mystery, in every change of direction in history, is ambiguously actualized in the historical forms of self-knowledge. Man always lives it as an experience of oppositions between a knowledge that is unknown - whose pole of ignorance is not univocal - and the source from where that knowledge may flow, divinity in the case of St. Augustine. In general, it is a mystery that is lived as the infinitude of the inner world and a dialectics of certainties and indéterminations. There is one invariant evidenced in the history of the forms of self-gnosis, which serves as a reference framework to outline the general and the particular. Said certainty is revealed in the intuition of the limits erected against the will to investigate inwardness. Self-investigaiton in Heraclitus defines itself when he hold that he adumbrates the unlimited depth of the soul and of the cosmos; and in St. Augustine, when he proclaims the unembraceability of divinity. Both of them discover fathomless abysses in the soul and, in St. Augustine, ignorance concerning himself is a correlative of the ignorance concerning the other, which introduces a new feature proper to Christian self-gnosis. The oracle, as an inspiring source of the imperative to know one's self, is now succeeded by the confessions and soliloquies. His Confessions represent and constitute in style and depth a profound historical change in the Western world. In the same way, as we shall see further on, Montaigne investigates himself as Michel Montaigne, but from that Renaissance attitude he describes a self that represents the universally human, so that more than a personal exaltation, he relates what is happening to him as an inner destiny affecting the whole of humankind.</page><page sequence="11">A HISTORY OF SELF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 189 St Augustine achieves the transit from oracle to prayer, because he invokes God in order to know himself. "Bring forth - he implores in his Confessions (Ch. XVIII) - out of this frightful abyss the soul that is looking for You". And that is why he insists (Ch. IV, 14, 23) "Great abyss is man whose hairs you have counted, О Lord, without one being lost without You knowing it; and, nevertheless, his hairs are easier to count than his affections and the movements of his heart". He associates the unfathomable of memory and the vision of the world and its landscapes with the impenetrability of the soul. "Great - he affirms - is the virtue of memory, and this is something that causes horror in me, my God: infinite and deep multiplicity. And this is the soul and this am I myself. What am I, then, my God? What is my nature? (X, 17, 26). We thus see that in Augustine the astonishment at the originary or, if you will, primordial astonishment, finds expression as perplexity in the presence of himself. Surprise when facing his self derives from the fact that even not knowing his self he lives it as something enigmatic and miraculous. From there the prayer addressed to God pleading for illumination concerning his nature, his soul which he knows as a mysterious abyss. "Know me, know Thyself. This is my prayer" (Soliloquies, II, 1, 1). In Augustine self-gnosis constitutes the pure center that coordinates everything man may perceive and experience. It is a sort of psychological invariant, such that it bases the scope of the possible on the ambiance of certainty and indétermination. In this way he defines the world as being everything that concerns us and what sustains us, as the sphere of the multiplicity of intimate experience proper to wakefulness or to dream. "World is to me everything that is offered to my spirit, no matter what it is", he firmly holds in Against Academicians (Ch. XI, 24). The reference to himself, to others and to God, is the trilogy of relations that arises from his conception and experience of self-gnosis, always within a revealing background of the paradox of a knowledge of not knowing. That is to say, the self-certainty of the self represents the cosmic source of all possible revelations. De Trinitate (X, IV, 6) offers us a most illustrative text concerning what is stated above, in the paradoxes of the knowledge of the soul in the soul. "But, how does (the soul) know that it knows something, ignorant as it is of himself? It does not know a soul that knows, but one that knows itself. Then it knows itself. Besides, when it looks for itself in order to know itself it knows its search; therefore, it is already aware of itself. He concludes, therefore, that it is impossible to be completely ignorant of the self. Because if it knows that it does not know, it already knows itself, and if it ignores that it ignores, it is not looking for itself in order to know itself. Hence, the mere fact of looking for itself, is it not proof that it itself it is more known than ignored? In looking for itself in order to know itself, does it know that it is looking for itself and that it does not know itself'? Augustine projects such a linking together of logical and psychological reflexes concerning knowledge in non-knowledge onto the field of interpersonal relations with a like penetration ( Confessions ,X, 3, 4). This dialectics of inner certainty linked with doubt also expresses itself with Cartesian features in The</page><page sequence="12">190 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN City of God , starting in special from the analysis of the paradoxes of deceit and of deceiving one's self (L, X, C, 26). The self-gnosis of Augustine constitutes, for the first time, or raises self-knowledge to the level of originary source of knowledge about man, the cosmos and God. Vis-à-vis Socrates, to whom the knowledge of one's self represents a moral investigation, more than one on nature or a theology, self-knowledge in St. Augustine transforms the narration of his own history, his confessions, into a new vision of man, of the world and of God. In other words, his metaphysics of self-gnosis opens up a new epoch in the history of man which we might summarize by saying: in the beginning, there was the knowledge of himself VI. History of the Self Portrait and the Knowledge of One's Self Every style of life shows itself under shapes of its own. Its outwardness sheds some light on the inwardness that animates them. Through these manifestations of expression man communicates feelings and externalizes his ideas of existence. He discovers himself through expression and through expressivity he reflects his intuition of the world. This indicates, besides, that the process of expression contains elements of self-knowledge, even if in the act of exteriorizing an individual should not aim at this in the first place. In view of this, it is necessary to investigate the degree of self-knowledge made possible by certain types of expression, whenever it is deliberately looked for. The object is to attempt to find out the knowledge provided by the vision of one's own outwardness vis-à-vis the evidence presented to introspection and, especially, under what shape there takes place a re-encounter with what is manifested truthfully in the cogito , as soon as the face is seen as externalization of the intimate. The language of inwardness that exteriorizes itself teaches us, throughout the history of art, not only the evolution of the ways of conceiving the design of the face and gestures, but also some shapes of the sensitive being that present unique inner experiences. In this sense, there is a certain degree of correspondence between the course followed by the history of the self-portrait, from Durerò down to Cezanne, and the renewed attempts at self-knowledge found in autobiographies and philosophical reflections, from Montaigne to Nietzsche. These are different ways of observation of one's self that shed light on each other from the vantage point of their peculiar possibilities and limitations, but which converge in a common desire to achieve the authentic knowledge of one's self. Man's immediate vision of the world is made up of expressions and things; that is to say, an individual sees exteriorities that shine with an inner light and distinguishes what is solely confined within an unchanging being. Because the sight of a face offers clear differences in comparison with what is presented merely as an object. The meaning of the expression in the eye, the face, just like the meaning of words, expresses itself through what may be sensed, but there is</page><page sequence="13">A HISTORY OF SELF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 191 more to it. In contrast with the existential silence of the landscape and things, the face illumines a boundless inwardness. The look emerges as something physical, but transcends it. In this sense, the highest manifestation in art, and the one that is most complex in expressivity, arises from the creative decision that impels the painter towards his self-portrait. Man aspires to know himself just as much as he knows how far he is from himself; moreover, he knows himself and discovers himself as distant as well as existent, thanks to that selfsame feeling of inner distance from himself that does not diminish even if his will to know himself acquires the characteristics of an obsession. The fact of representing oneself in that trance of self-observation, wherein the shape adopted by the self-portrait constitutes only the image of a possible way of knowing one's self, leaves fruitful and aesthetic gleanings. Transcending certain introspective delusions, plastic language allows a return to one's self, to the "dialogue of the soul with itself'.1 It establishes actual communication in the Platonic sense of the term, and although the painted image immobilizes a single instant of the act of perception of oneself, it may harbour a continuity between the past and the expectation of the future through the now, as is the case in the self-portraits of Rembrandt. When the painter contemplates himself in order to discover the way in which he incarnates the depths within himself, that creative process shows up, as a whole, essential aspects of the expressive phenomenons. Because in the re- encounter with himself, as developed throughout the long series of self-portraits of Rembrandt and van Gogh, virtualities are actualized, as well as primordial problems of expressivity. To begin with, these works constitute an inexhaustible source of experience and psychological insights concerning an "ambiguous" recognition which is not self-knowledge, and which are a product of self- contemplation. Nonetheless, even taking for granted the radical impossibility of knowing oneself, it so happens that the psychological intentions of self-portraits exteriorize modes of inner experience, revealed only to the intimate look incarnated in the work. It is true that they are not discursive findings, but nevertheless they bring to light new layers of conscience out of that same impossibility of knowing one's self. It is the expressive paradox inherent to self-portraying, that at the same time that it sheds light on a cognitive limit of a psychological kind, it opens up new horizons of intimacy. The evolution of the modes of representation of the human image in painting constitutes a veritable psychological history of the feeling of life which transcends the search of the aesthetic finding, under the shape of original designs of faces. When comparing the portraits of Botticelli with the works of Modigliani we not only verify differences of style exteriorized in the conception of space, line and color; neither do we limit ourselves to establishing their historical roots in the Renaissance or in the Twentieth century. Beyond these connections we may observe a peculiar mode of reference of the personage towards himself, the other and the world; in short, we see the manifestation of different feelings concerning existence correlative of diverse introspective attitudes. The variations of por-</page><page sequence="14">192 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN -traiture in the West show the phases through which the historical process of the conscience of one's self has evolved. So that the changes observed in certain aesthetic categories reflect, fundamentally, a period of the desire of self- knowledge. It could be said it represents some sort of aesthetic derivation of the millenary philosophical attempt which, starting with the Delphic imperative, passing through Christianity, St. Augustine, Montaigne and Pascal, reaches down to Nietzsche and Freud, without there being any sense to setting a limit to the possibilities of self-analysis. In every one of these stages - whether it be the Socratic doctrine or the Christian conception - there develops a knowledge of one's self that is a resultant of the interdependence between self-observation, image of the world and attitude in front of another. It is understood, on the other hand, that this historicity of self-knowledge does not modify the inner form of self-awareness as an original phenomenon; neither does it alter the structure of the "dialogue of the soul with itself' Plato speaks about, conceiving of it as a unit of thought, communication and discourse. Nevertheless, we see in this historical process the manifestation of new layers of intimacy, correlatives of mutations in the assumptions that guide self-analysis. These changes are at times associated with an intransigent will towards self-unmasking that ends up by illuminating new experiences of the feeling of infinitude within one's self. In this sense, van Gogh undertakes a search that ignores dogmatic limitations; that is, he has a foreboding of the unpredictable character of what he will come to know, because his inward look is not prefigured by moral categories anticipating what he is looking for. But his self-reflexive daring, plastically externalized, cannot stop him from perceiving himself as a stranger to himself. Nonetheless, man perceives in the awareness of the intimacy that evades him the identity of his self through the variations in its modes of manifesting itself. To know oneself is to live this dialectical game of proximity to and of distance from one's self. "To refer to myself - observes Jaspers - no longer means being myself, but waiting for myself in an inner action. In the essence of this relating with oneself as an origin of being-one's-self there is a radical failure of the possibility of identifying myself in something that has become objective. Because of the fact of actively relating with myself I am only the possibility of being-myself. Because of this I am never to myself, in time, end and perfection-, I do not know myself, I am only certain of myself insofar as I am my self'2 Because the certainty of existing is correlative of references to an expressive world, self-reflection is not lost in the fathomless depth of a pure conscience, nor in an empty being absorbed within one's self. That which in the natural attitude is experienced without tensions, results oppressive in self-observation. That is to say, Husserl points out that in the state of wakefulness the world appears as an indeterminate contour and an infinite temporal horizon. But the intimate world would become something distressingly unlimited if self-observation were not associated with the awareness of living a situation, which implies that it is inherent to what is at present perceived inside to cloak itself in a halo of external horizons. So that elements are incorporated to the field of self-perception, elem-</page><page sequence="15">A HISTORY OF SELF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 193 -ents are incorporated to the field of self-perception, elements that remit to a particular attitude vis-à-vis the world. "Constantly - says Husserl - I find myself as if it were with someone who perceives, represents itself, thinks, feels, desires, and so on, and in thus finding myself I find myself most of the time referred to the reality that constantly surrounds me."3 This natural world connected with the cogito , with an abandoning oneself to living naturally, is different from the self-reflective experience that aims at the knowledge of the conflict of motives and estimative preferences that make up character; it is different, in short, from the feeling of living a personal destiny. It is as much so as the natural attitude could be with regard to the arithmetical attitude that allows one to face the world of numbers, oblivious of the surrounding reality. In the knowledge of one's self the cogito also refers to a world, but not to the natural one, nor to the ideal world of numbers, but to an expressive universe animated by hidden meanings. In front of the possible worlds that are correlatives of determined attitudes of conscience, the world that constitutes the background of knowing oneself as personal singularity, is peopled by concealed symbolism, desires real and apparent, masks that endlessly succeed each other. The fact is that there exists a mysterious unity between the process of self-knowledge and that of reference to what is real, conceived as an infinite horizon of significations.4 To prescind from implicitly taking into account what is exterior in self- observation is a task as impossible to achieve as to think without words. From there that the process of self knowledge turns out to be as variable as the modes of experiencing the self, the body, the other and the world. Because there are no self-reflective attitudes indifferent to the infinite ways of establishing ties with nature and history. The knowledge of one's self constitutes a point of maximum tension in life, because due to its historicity it reflects personal existence with all its implications. From here there derives the impossibility of foreseeing future stages of the discovery of one's self, of its changing levels of internalization, as likewise it is equally impossible to predict future visions of the world, or to conceive of the forms that cosmic feeling will adopt. It is proper to the expressiveness of self-knowledge to develop as an historical process of increasing complexity, conditioned by ascetic attitudes. Self-analysis is, besides, subject to the limitations of the dialectics of expressivity, inasmuch as we always externalize what we feel via shapes or words that represent an agency that deforms at the same time that it reveals new virtualities of what has been lived. In short, transit of knowledge of the self in general to the singular self that one is in its empirical manifestations, takes place in favor of a specific reference to a world that is not the natural one, but to one that is expressive in the widest sense of the term. The distance or perplexity when facing one's self thus reflects certain virtualities of the active and cognitive ties with the universe. The peculiar awareness of not knowing ourselves also corresponds to an inquiring look upon the world. Moral grandeur manifests itself, in one of its forms, as a will to unveil</page><page sequence="16">194 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN what is hidden within one's self and in the world. "To know others - writes Lao-tse - is wisdom, but to know oneself is a wisdom that is superior because our own self is the deepest and most concealed."5 There is nothing more revealing, with respect to this, than to study the precesses of expression in the attempt at self-knowledge implied in the creation of a self-portrait. Particularly when one pays attention to the psychological moment in which it is originated as a titanic struggle to be and to discover one's self in that plastically modeled mode of being. In fact, expressive phenomenons show an uncommon scheme of structure if we place ourselves in the perspective opened up by introspective efforts, just as they are perceived in the struggle to give shape to matter out of the innermost feeling of one's self. It would seem that the artist then inhibits the biological spontaneity of expressions. Van Gogh turns into a tension of opposites the unity between the sense shown in the face and the mimic movements that incarnate it, unity that in the immediate appearance manifests itself as indissoluble harmony. Because man reveals, as naturally as he breathes, the spontaneous coincidence between he who expresses himself and that which is expressed. That is, what nature achieves in every expression with great simplicity, without artifice or violence, is carried out in the act of self-portraiture thanks to certain dialectical antagonisms that contribute to confer their revealing strength on the self-portrait. Van Gogh obtains an expressivity raised to the highest point polarizing what is spiritual impulse and what constitutes inertia of matter. That is why it might be said that he achieves the union of body and soul out of such an inner tension that, despite that polarity, the spirit never appears as pure spirit, nor matter as pure materiality. In this kind of work, the mysterious natural impulse through which a fate impresses its traces on the countenance obeys a conscious effort. What a face models from within throughout time, imperceptibly, serenely, turns into a complex dialectical leap as soon as the feeling of one's self is immobilized in an exterior image. Because when the painter sets about the task of reproducing his own image out of his innermost being he is far from facing a peaceful conquest as would be the case if his purpose were to outline a passively imitative portrait. On the contrary, in the almost fantastic effort to transmute the feeling of himself into a material form that expresses it, it becomes evident to him that he does not know himself, and that it is an illusion to express his personal background. Nonetheless, this expressive impotence is revealing, insofar as it shows man something about his nature in this paradoxical discovery of himself beyond himself. The artist has the foreboding that his inner look may be in error, and thus he receives what is perceived with subtle suspicion. He then struggles to create the character that will represent him, actualizing a real actor's effort which, out of the intuition of a character and of a destiny, sets about the process of animating his face, voice, gestures and movements. In short, on the pictorial reproduction of one's own countenance, apparently devoid of tensions, there is superposition of the dramatic trance of knowing one's self which acquires the form of primor-</page><page sequence="17">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 195 -dial metaphysical confrontation. The artist goes through a supreme experience when he faces himself. Expressivity appears to him as being the adequate key to decipher the sense of the human world. He therefore confronts the face as the absolute presence of man. He knows that the light in his look is, besides, inseparable from references to virtual relations, as self-contemplation is a particular case in the drama of encounter with the other. The analysis emphasizes the fact that the knowledge of expressive phenomena contributes to show - and such is the theoretical purpose here - the illusions, delusions and ambiguities that affect the reflective knowledge of one's self. Because in self-analysis the certainty of being is not associated with the certitude of how one is, neither is the evidence of existence accompanied by the knowledge of the character with which that same existence is lived. In the series of self-portraits painted by van Gogh we observe the expressive convergence of knowing about himself and feeling of life, above the features proper to his exalted expressionism. Besides, in the last works of this type there is exteriorization of the ascetic conquest of expressive unity between conscience of himself and existence, shedding light on each other. The fathomless melancholy of the self-portraits, especially the one that bears the name of Painter with the gray hat , is followed by a tendency to perceive himself tragically, as if in the limit of his being, representing the incarnation of an anguished conscience. Introspective inclinations are not univocal, and because of it, in every case, the existential feeling of the self is filled with peculiar contents. In this sense, expressivity discovers what is concealed from self-reflection, thanks to a plastic play of tensions between the inside and the outside. Already the fact of looking at one's self objectified as a looking afar uncovers the paradox of meditation centered on the self; it shows that self-contemplation is complementary to the experience of a determined feeling of being in the world. In these works of van Gogh, this complementarity allows a view of the union there exists between intimacy and situation; it sheds some light on a stubborn search that borders upon life itself, whose fanaticism is essentially different from the serenity with which Montaigne waits for the irruption of the unexpected upon his self. Van Gogh turns his eyes on himself and the world with an overwhelming passion that expresses the tragic attitude he has towards existence. He looks at himself as if he did so from the enigmatic and originary depths of life. This expressive impulse is manifested in all his work, so that the face appears as if translucent in his flowers, landscapes and cosmic visions. Deep down, most of his pictures are self-portraits in which violent colors bursting with sun shine like faces. A singular lucidity penetrates them. "It seems to me that an inmost source of existence - acknowledges Jaspers - opens up in front of us for an instant, as if the depths hidden in every life were discovered here directly"6 Jaspers further declares that his masterpieces externalize a vibration that may not be borne for long, and which we at once attempt to avoid. In this he recognizes the drama of our situation that makes us shudder to our very roots. The affective commotion provoked by the self-portraits derives from the basic</page><page sequence="18">196 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN solitude towards which converge both awareness of one's self and existence. But this occurs thanks to a spiritual and material luminosity that culminates in a realism touched with enchantment, and which proceeds from his self-conscience that, within certain limits, leads him to possess himself of his very disease.7 Now then, the singularity of the authentic self-portrait resides in this stalking of one's self, whose affective tone may oscillate between the serene inward look, as in the case of Rembrandt, and the aggressive challenge of van Gogh's looking upon himself. What inner mysteries does the self-portrait uncover as a product of the will towards self-gnosis? It illuminates almost ineffable features of the inner landscape, whose most relevant notes will be described alluding to works by Durerò, Titian, El Greco, Rembrandt, Goya, and van Gogh. Let us say, to begin with that the self-portrait uncovers the infinitude of the experience of the intimate. When trying to give expressive form to the inner image of one's self, the "other" unknown that dwells in every person is revealed. The depth of the design implies, simultaneously, a deeper delving within the lucid conscience and within the unknown in one, which allows a view of itself in the light of a kind of expressive lightning; so that the objectivations of the knowledge of one's self unmask us and reveal us as others. From there the acute perplexity, together with a metaphysical exasperation, exteriorized by some of van Gogh's self-portraits. There is in them an emphasis of passion to conquer an unlimited inwardness whose final frustration is evidenced in certain features of resentment and rebellion in front of his own impotence. When painting his portrait the expressive infinitude of the face becomes apparent, appearing to him all the more foreign and unknown the more he penetrates within himself. To the point that in these works a sullen ire is seen ambiguously, fed by an irrational vehemence, as may be seen in the 1889 self-portrait, which is now in the Impressionist Museum in Paris. He attempts to know himself and he becomes infinite, unlimited and distant. The fact is that placed at the crossroads of portraying himself, there surges out of his brush a character whose inner path goes beyond himself. So that knowing one' self represents the other face of perceiving oneself as a stranger. It occurs as if the perception of what is foreign to us were inherent to knowledge of oneself the fact of feeling distant from oneself constituted the background of evidence on which that same knowledge rests. In other words, the identity of the self is apprehended united to a thinking and feeling regarding oneself that denies it. Of course, this experience is a correlative of the type of vital aspiration that a person grasps at. "Two souls, alas, reside in my breast", exclaims Faust , referring to impulses that amorously link him with the terrestrial and with others that impel him to rise towards the sublime.8 The dramatic unfolding of van Gogh derives from the fact in his expressionist exasperation and search of total expressivity at every moment he perceives himself as being diverse, so that his externalization is at the same time an approach to himself and distance from himself. It happens then that the sincere confessions in his portraits distance him</page><page sequence="19">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 197 from his own inner image. The dramatic will to attain a radical psychological nakedness brings about resentment caused by his impotence in conquering it. From there the rictus of voluntary auto-anihilation his self-portraits show. The brutal desire of sincerity fills him with anguish when he verifies the impossi- bility of satisfying it. He portrays himself formally following the originary movement of his starry nights, and in the same way he links therein primeval chaos and cosmic order, in the representation of the face he associates the gross and the sublime as expression of titanic struggle humiliated by impotence. The fanaticism of the search of himself and moral veracity, deforms the expressions that border upon the fantastic when he goes beyond his real possibilities.9 When the artist discovers himself through the exteriority of his coun- tenance he reaches a cognitive limit that he may nor surpass, as the face turns into something that is at the same time inadequate and hidden. It is the plastic and psychological fate that results from the attempt to apprehend the reality of one's self through the medium of matter, when at heart the aspiration is to find the inner metaphysical center, eluding even one's own physiognomic features. That is why the look that is directed towards the innermost being objectivizes itself in a singular 'disrealization' and deformation of one' own physiognomy, changing according to the psychological and ethical mode of reference to one's self. That is the cause of dissimilarities presented by the diverse autobiographical images that Rembrandt and Van Gogh create at different stages of their life. Alone in the presence of themselves, looking for their authentical being, they create faces that reflect variable inner times, because the different level of the knowledge of one's self is accompanied by correlative modulations of the expressive form of the countenance. When attempting to externalize the reality of himself, in obedience to an obsessive longing for self-knowledge, his own finitude is revealed. Evoking himself, the painter finds himself on the brink of an abyss, attentive to the silent revelations of the soliloquy. Because the self portrait betrays the desire to unmask, to confess and to discover the inner physiognomy with certainty. From there that the person portrayed should appear as a visionary of himself, glimpsing something supernatural as he scrutinizes his phychological depths. Van Gogh is, without a doubt, aware of it. In a letter to his brother Theo he confesses that in his portraits he aspires to evoke intimacy with such emotional intensity that in the future they might be contemplates as "apparitions." From there derives the fact that his will to attain self-knowledge should condition a paradoxical rupture of the outer image which, nonetheless, some- how reveals him. The inner unity is manifested dialectically divided between who contemplated and what he contemplates; that is to say, divided, on the one hand, between his immediate experience and the look he direct inwards, and on the other, the contents and psychological directions he apprehends in it. This complexity of the inner being is seen by any painter who attempts a self- portrait at a level of interiorization that surpasses awareness as a mere existential certainty of the self. So that the feeling of unity is not opposed to the fact of</page><page sequence="20">198 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN perceiving a plurality of intimate dispositions that contribute to self-knowledge. We thus know ourselves transcending that feeling of inner unity. The extreme tension of the existential awareness of the self orients and displaces the center of reflection towards visions of personal finitude. Origin and psychological boundaries harmonize in the experience of himself and in the emotional violence of the physiognomies of van Gogh. It is the dramatic inner circle described by the designs of his self-portraits, which anticipate the course of ulterior expressionism, announcing the future search of the abstract and abandonment of the object, and, lastly, foretelling the magic fatality of Kafka and the anguish of the absurd in Camus. Now then, we must bear in mind that the artist tries to discover himself through the visible world. From a reflection in his mirror he passes, through the intimate, to matter shaken by the spirit. The ambiguous knowledge of himself becomes patent to him in the creative act under the form of strokes of certitude linked to signs that lose themselves in the unknown; from where derive the expression of impotence in the pictures of van Gogh, and the incisive pain caused by the lack of transparency with which the likeness created by his hands appears out of the depths of himself. These faces incarnate the most dramatic confession of he who remains detained in an obscure feeling of existing which, despite its intensity, has nothing of lucid awareness associated with the knowledge of. the true motives that condition personal conduct. For the same reason, it is understandable that in the intent to objectify that kind of originary and ritual encounter with the metaphysical center of himself, there should take place the flight of shapes. This occurs in Rembrandt through the adoption of the chiaroscuro, choosing the touches with greatest affinity with the intimate, scarcely a murmur of materiality in which to incarnate itself. There is, finally, a search of harmony between matter and form, establishing a significant parallel between the purification of one's self and the adequate formal asceticism. In other words, the process of internalization that culminates in the plastic externalization - because the artist discovers himself through the act of incarnating himself - must posess the ambiguous property of knowledge about itself: it must be the inner light of the occult. He who observes himself tries to conquer, achieve the essential spirituality of his own image, stripping it of what is contingent and accessory. Such are the first lessons of the self-pottrait which, as regards the search of unity between the self and exteriority, point out the tendency towards detachment from matter, and to expression through said detachment. In the act of portraying himself the artist aspires to discover his personal destiny through the expression of himself. When he materializes this desire he witnesses the appearance of the enigmas and revelations provided by his task. To begin with, as in the case of van Gogh, he feels the anguish of the ineffable of the self to the self itself, so that awareness appears to him as having a crushing fugacity , no lesser than his limitation. Nevertheless, he gropes at something deci- sive amidst that blindness towards himself. That is why his looks display the</page><page sequence="21">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 199 double depth and limitation of light and darkness. This explains why the general expressive tone of his self-portraits mysteriously remits to a beyond the countenance itself. It might be said that the look only glimpses what it is looking for diring its attention to a remote point. Surprisive expressive cycle in which recognition is succeeded by a perceiving oneself as a stranger, as if the exterior vision of a person were different from the inner one, subject, like it, to illusions. Does it not happen that we are sometimes surprised at ourselves when we look at ourselves in the mirror? During an instant we are invaded by a certain feeling of oddity in front of the image reflected, true alarming foreboding of maladjustment between intimate knowledge and one's face that is unknown. This dissociation, brief as lightning, is brought about by some subtle mimic movement, the sudden appearance of a color, the rigidity or laxness of the features. It is an almost imperceptible distortion of the type of ambiguity of the body, in the sense that it experiences itself as being different from the self that inhabits it. Only that in the physiognomical astonishment in front of oneself there takes place an unfolding inherent to the desire of knowning oneself, while the perception of the body as an object constitutes a normal phenomenon of the awareness of existing. The peculiarities of the self-portrait as an expressive form are defined within the limits of knowning oneself as exteriority and of externalizing as self. It dialectics appears in all its complexity along the road that goes from knowledge about oneself towards the encounter of his corporality. The limit of his possibilities is reached in a personal exaltation that is more intoxication than knowledge, more existential crisis than moral certitude. When the artist looks upon himself with vehement keenness, his face first appears to him as a mask; he then discovers that the will to look inside and to model a face expressing intimate experiences, clashes with the mediation of matter and the inertia of unconfessed social roles. Because the self-portrait symbolizes the clear-cut longing to see oneself, at least once, without a mask, though revealed through the same materiality that masks us. It is a peeking at oneself from within, but which is externalized in the shape, and in it we are surprised at the affinity with psychic experience, at what is unknown to ourselves and the obscure feeling we sometimes have of ourselves. In his last portraits Van Gogh paints the perplexity of he who uselessly takes off numberless masks, because the last image of the face always shows a new mask. In these works we are dazzled by the tremendous effort to approximate what is perceived as interiority to its appearance as exteriority. They represent an intransigent desire of fidelity to body and soul, whose mechanism of coincidence remains mysterious. That is to say, we ignore how, suddenly, in the subjectivity of the artist, there appears shining evidence that what has been designed is to some extent equivalent to what has been lived; we do not know, in general, when we look at ourselves, how image and psychic experience become commensurable, notwithstanding their insuperable heterogeneity. That is why self-portraits detain the instant in which the artist has perceived the hidden harmony between expression and psychic experience, between face and feeling of existence. Expres-</page><page sequence="22">200 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN -sivity shows up the intuitive measure of that equivalence, although it does not give the clue as to how coincidence is achieved between expression and feeling of existence, between knowledge of one's self and the physiognomic features that reflect it. That which a face expresses, perceived as a unit by us, appears problematic when the artist, as if he were a demiurge, attempts to fuse meaning and shape. In the end there remains within indétermination the qualitative transit, the formal metamorphosis of the contents of experience which passes from the mirror image, through the awareness of self, to culminate in the image that is created. In the Mirrors series by Goya, surprise in front of oneself, united to fantastic re-encounter, reaches the absurd and anguish. The characters in these works, placed in front of a mirror are horrified to see that the glass gives them back the image of a monkey, a frog or another animal or, at best, their caricature. We have already spoken about expressions of the face that mysteriously remit beyond themselves. In these it would seem that the artist evokes himself with greater fidelity when he represents himself as being lost in the distance. I thus specifying this fact we notice that the discovery of the medium the artist makes use of to represent that double play of the immediate presence of the spiritual as expressive impulse that draws apart from the subjective nucleus in which it is originated, surpasses analytical and descriptive possibilities. Nevertheless, it may be affirmed that expressions give us a knowledge relative to the experience of the intimate which can not be obtained through self-reflective means. The central problem that presents itself at this point is that of what it is that we see in the expression of being absorbed, and which evades the direct analysis of self-observation. That is to say, the question arises as to what is shown to us by that transmutation of metaphysically unspatial into spatial relations, that takes place when an intimate experience is turned into a physiognomical expressivity or into a work of art. This idea is complicated even further if we accept Simel's observation concerning the fact that certain characters and self-portraits by Rembrandt exteriorize a non-spatial vision. Because to the above is added the astonishing aesthetic phenomenon not only of spatially expressing the non- spatial, that is, a psychic experience, but of carrying it out through spatial representations that in their turn symbolize something non-spatial, as is the case in the type of look that Simmel qualifies as non-spatial. "If one observes attentively - Simmel points out in this sense - the difference in the way of looking between an essential and profound man and one who is vulgar and insignificant, it will be seen that the first seems to look afar outside the object - which, however, he fixes in a penetrating and attentive way - not afar in a lineal sense but supra spatial: the look is directed towards something that may not be limited and which has no spatial signification whatsoever. In men of inferior life the look is directed only towards that which they are looking at, and the energy that arises form the act of vision is like a wall without doors: it simply bounces back upon itself. In the others, on the other hand, it is as if the living strength of the look were not adjusted by the direction fixed by the object, it even manifests</page><page sequence="23">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 201 itself as not having any direction, instead of which it shows an intensity that is non-spatial, not adhered to any determinate thing."10 Now then, as regards the type of look in which the subject looks at himself, its expressivity reveals a mysterious conciliation of contraries; it conciliates the metaphysical proximity to one's self, externalized as a look that evades itself, together of a losing of one's self in the unlimited that symbolizes a re-encounter in the bosom of something universal. Whoever has at any time stopped to meditate ascetically, will have experienced this antithetical feeling of loss and recuperation of one's self within a vital plenitude whose final intimacy is a going beyond itself. It then happens as if the process of self-gnosis followed a dialectical cycle in which the delving into subjectivity borders on the inner vision of that which transcends it. The self- portraits of Rembrandt constitute the deepest symbolical representation of the dialectics of self-observation. They communicate through expressive means what appears to be inexpressible via discursion. They show that the attention directed towards oneself conditions a look that is fixed on an indefinite point, at the same time that they express an intense concentration on the self. So that the vagueness in the looks of the old characters painted by Rembrandt, aimed at indeterminate horizons, imply two moments that apparently exclude each other. Simmel would say that transcendence is immanent in that non-spatial look. But not only does this teach the mystery of how the non-spatiality of the look may be expressed through space, but also, besides, how engrossment within oneself implies self- discovery as proximate and remote; because this type of look penetrates a reality that is beyond itself, Rembrandt symbolizes the encounter of oneself through a self-reference that is essentially indetermined, that does not apprehend any particular content, unless it be its inner center as an incessant transcending of itself. VII. Self-knowledge and vision of the world Man also discovers himself when contemplating the world, because the feeling of one's self and self-knowledge elaborate their certainty with elements from external reality and, above all, with concrete ways of perceiving oneself in it. In its most profound form the knowledge of oneself coincides with a metaphysical experience of enrootment in things. It coincides even when the inner look only detains itself upon the analysis of the subjective source of the motives underlying acts. This happens because the certitude of a way of being in the world is something inherent to the psychic experience of that inspection. That is to say, self-knowledge is not resolved in mere reference to the self, as the return to oneself fuses itself with a determined awareness of the real. So that when self-analysis is insisted on the deepening in the interiority is perceived simultaneously as belonging to an ambiance, and the way subjectivity opens itself to that vital environment will lend to it its affective and existential coloring. There stands out here an essential peculiarity of the self-portrait-and in</page><page sequence="24">202 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN general, of the looking at the portrait - in that the whole design is specifically ordered around a reference of the author to himself. This is the double direction of the look, that illumines a sort of ineffable inner circulation, directed towards the world and towards the self. It contemplates in the contemplating itself. In this ambiguity resides the depth and spell of the work achieved. The act of looking establishes the expressive center of within and without , each one shedding light on the other. In this sense, the self-portrait of Durerò in the Art Gallery in Munich is overwhelming, as is, also, to a lesser degree, the one at El Prado. The face appears in a deep study, detained in an intimate instant from which flow two divergent rays of the look, the one that submerges inwards, and the one that loses itself in the world. Both of theih draw afar infinitely, but they balance, conferring on the countenance a certain immutable seal. These paintings thus display a harmony between the world and the self that permeates the face with a visionary gravidity. Because the face appears remote and fathomless, pregnant with the secret strength of nature. But to this singular ambiguity a second one is added: knowing one's self as an other, the revelation of one's self as a stranger. Such antagonisms and inner tensions submerge these pictures in a somber atmosphere that borders on the sinister. It is because we glimpse in them the chilling expressive foreboding of the continuous loss and recovery of the identity of the self that presents itself as an inner rending as soon as the individual attempts to know himself, although this confers spiritual grandeur on this type of painting. Each and every self-portrait develops a monologue, even a tragic one, when the author faces his own destiny in the convergence of his multiple lines of expression towards a final spiritual instant, but provided it obeys an impulse oriented to shedding light on what is hidden in his innermost self, rather than the limited desire to solve a plastic problem. Of course, the content of this soliloquy is as variable as the idea of life the artist possesses. Because the aspiration to know one's self - or to rediscover oneself - does not follow a single direction. This attitude is complementary to a determined vision of the world and of personal existence. From there the fact that it is not adventurous to affirm that, from the perspective of western painting, the evolution of style in these works allows a view of the history of the awareness that man has had of himself. Because the handling of form, light and color has been worked out, trained through the outlining of faces that condense a passionate confession. These faces, besides, also present a testimony of the fact that the individual is impelled to engross himself in self-contemplation because of a particular metaphysical feeling of existence. It is therefore necessary to understand what the monologue communicates in the pictorial image, starting from said feeling, understanding this last from the mode through which the artist strives to know himself. So that there does not exist a reference to the self which may be isolated from a certain cosmic experience, nor does this primary emotion of the real exist isolated from the intoxication of one's self. In Van Gogh, the perplexity stirred by the image of himself stimulates a</page><page sequence="25">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 203 tortured longing to delve within the innermost self, which lights up all his features with rebellion in the way in which in his landscapes he represents the shaking of the earth; in Rembrandt, on the contrary, we find the deep serenity of a seeing resigned to the vision offering itself to sight. That tenuous melancholy surrounding the portraits of Rembrandt harmonizes with the fact that his characters - and the author himself - spy from the watchtower of a remote past, after which they cross a present that sinks into the future. In the self-portrait in the Vienna Museum, just as in the one in the Frick Collection in New York, the encounter of the self through time, is surrounded only by a weak dramatism. His last self-portraits, in special - he painted nearly a hundred - possess a strange and disturbing tranquillity, altogether foreign from the obstinate strokes with which Van Gogh represents himself, profound in the limits of the somber. The serenity of the images of Rembrandt surges from an inner conciliatio of contraries. They appear submerged in time and silence. They are animated by a wisdom that does not flaunt itself, but one which, sweetly contained, constrains itself to the longing to go further beyond itself, towards the achievement of a deep identity that is not hurt by the future. One could say that he wards off the inexorable flow of time with the look in eyes whose light identifies the multiple and the singular, what is changing and what remains, thanks to the resignation that is peaceful participation in the being. These faces show how the basic secret of the self reveals itself only through indifference concerning everything that is fleet. Their looks project themselves into the future, free from anguish, lighted up by the silent submersion in the self; they contemplate the world and they perceive signs of the eternal in the immediate reality united to the certainty of the caducity of the living. They are looks that are free from fanaticism, and whose deep solitude prepares the serene joy that man may find in the same inexorability of continuous change. The fact of trying to know himself through time paradoxically leads him to discovery of the unvarying in man, the spark of identity that is not extinguished. It is that the deep awareness of life, of the instants that ceaselessly evade themselves, it might be said, substracts from the course of happening. In clear correspondence with that expressive truth, these self-portraits flow out of darknesses that are nebulous but tender; they rise out of a solitary night in which shines an awareness that keeps itself invariably attentive to itself. When the present is lived with a certain stoic melancholy, which is a sign of an awareness that looks upon the past and the future, it acquires a plenitude in which the anguished expectation of death is dispelled, Rembrandt perceptibly expresses that thought of Spinoza which proclaims that "beatitude is not the prize of virtue, but virtue itself'11. Because the feeling of beatitude excludes the tortured experience of the present. These works clearly show the lasting validity of the general principle according to which there is not a single, unique, pure and only reflective way of knowing one's self, but that there exist numberless possible forms that are the subjective correlate of a determinate cosmic sense, that imply experiences and meditations on the being and befalling. In Rembrandt, the experience of time and</page><page sequence="26">204 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN of growing old constitute the source from which the artist tries to surprise himself at his most intimate. Knowing that nothing remains unchanged represents the category that rules the process of self-gnosis concerning relations between life and spiritual metamorphosis. The re-encounter of one's self' takes place throughout time, as a search of the identical amid incessant change. As an ethical culmination of this, these physiognomies externalize the wisdom of he who experiences personal freedom in the Spinozian sense, as a meditation "not about death, but about life"12. As the idea of befalling is in this case the basis of his search of himself, it necessarily implies a vision of the mutations of corporality with regard to organic matter that is continuously suffering modification. That is to say, as there is a relation between the discovery of one's self and the fact of attributing a determined sense to the universe, which Rembrandt realizes through the intuition of time, it is understandable that in the faces in these works there should appear the peculiar dialectics of bodily changes that harmoniously conserve the identity of the person. As a natural consequence of this, one of the aspects of grandeur in the work of Rembrandt resides in not disclosing any rupture, we might say, between body and soul. The bodily appearance is deeply modified with the passing of time. It is also true that the painter has evolved as a person. However, time allows the permanence of a metaphysical nucleus of intimacy that the artist externalizes in an unchanging way, though always in agreement with the modifications of his face throughout the years. From adolescence to old age, he narrates his story through the register of a look that sheds light on the changing illusions forged around himself, no less than the disquietudes that constituted the animating psychological center of each one of those stages. In this sense, his last self-portraits show the surprising mastery over state of mind that is achieved when the certainty of personal finitude is faced with deep resignation. In such an intuition of temporality, this is surpassed as a negative condition of existence, because it immobilizes every instant that is lived with brush strokes of noble permanence that derive from the sweetness of an affective sediment, from the stoical acceptance of life that flows away. Rembrandt represents all this with such spiritual depth that the very flight of time and the loss of hope, serenly faced, far from darkening the image of life, surround it with an aura of eternity. The aspiration to conserve the ethical continuity of oneself represents an attitude that, in a way, excludes the preoccupation of conquering some sort of mastery over the external world. As a contrast, this antagonism becomes evident as soon as we contemplate self-portraits of Titian where the approximation of the artist to himself is correlative of a firm look directed upon the world with a challenging courage. In these paintings we observe bold countenances whose knowledge of themselves is announced as a powerful inner strength, capable of exerting irresistible dominion within its sphere of action. That is to say, in Titian, self-knowledge is manifested as a particular form of internalization that leads him to confront reality with sustained arrogance. Such a knowledge of himself harmonizes with the expression of firmness and security, and this unbounded</page><page sequence="27">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 205 confidence is the one that makes up the concrete contents of his mode of self-gnosis. In consequence, it may be said that world and look coincide as realities in these works, because the intensity of the scrutiny is such that the look by itself is nature, and nature, in its turn, is incarnated as a manifestation of the human look. In other words, in the decided impetuosity of the face penetrated by infinite longings there is a confluence of contemplating and of contemplating one's self; there is interchange between the inner and the outward look. From there that in Titian's characters his will of self-knowledge borders on the impulses of dominion over reality. These are known in as much as the wish to dominate the exterior is not impaired by reflection and self-analysis. The knowledge of one's self, in so far as its peculiarity expresses essential features of its intimate inclinations, borders upon the tendency to emphasize the wounding objectivity of the world's realities. This takes place, particularly, in his paintings of the Aretino, in gentlefolk, as in His Portrait of a Man (National Gallery in Washington), or in the painting that represents Pope Paul III and his relatives. These faces and bodies display an absolute appearance whose reality leaves no room for hesitation. These pictures exhibit that "intensity of the physical presence" that Tietze points out as a characteristic of some of his male images.13 Self-knowledge in them harmonizes with a form of self-dominion that is almost violence, as it is experienced as exclusive will of mastery over the real. In short, they are human figures that externalize a certain inexorable severity that confines self-reference to a disturbing realism. But behind objectivity there stalks the sadness of a coldly realistic attitude. Irrational exuberance, the overflow of vitality in those men of the Renaissance, actually gives glimpses of the nostalgia of the naïve knowledge of one's self that is lost, concealed in the ardor of action. If we now look at a painting with religious inspiration, we shall see that here too there is correlation between self-knowledge and mode of reference to the world, but of course such an achievement sets in motion different inclinations. In the self-portraits of El Greco there is manifestation of the fervent premonitions of light and inner darkness, of struggle and abandonment that penetrate the mystical felling. He notoriously exteriorizes these ultimate experiences when he represents himself as an evangelist; because in these images the absence from the world and seclusion of the look indicate a turning toward himself that excludes looking; it is an opening of the eyes of the soul, a look that does not look, although it is lighted inwardly. In El Greco there is confluence of the two directions of the look towards a point of intimate humility, one attentive to the self and one that points at the world. Which signifies that the mystical knowing oneself has, as a correlative mode of reference to the surroundings, an aspiration of communion with all existent things, in which there is no room for the will of dominion over the real. This is because, for the mystic, nature represents only a way of being adequate for the encounter of one's self.14 Van Gogh's self-analysis, though containing some religious elements, lacks the mystical vehemence proper to El Greco. Because Van Gogh pursues the authenticity of his image via an implacable struggle that reaches the level of</page><page sequence="28">206 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN exasperation, released by the awareness of the asymmetry there is between what is in him irreducible enigma and the unembraceable virtualities of the experience of the intimate and of the world. His self-portraits constitute a confession that is painful, but which always leaves in the shade an unfathomable part of his personality. Because they are not confessions that in an act of faith end up by illumining the unkown in one. They represent, rather, the honest and rending acknowledgment of how in the attempt to find his innermost self, eludes him. From there that those paintings are stirred by a breath of somber skepticism that leads one to the cold solitude of he who continues to be a mystery towards himself. Van Gogh looks upon himself as if from the center of a cosmic vertex. The turbulence of his starry nights sometimes constitutes the background of some of his self-portraits, as in the one painted in November, 1889, which is in the Impressionist Museum and also in the Portrait of the artist with his palette , in the Whitney collection, New York. This means that the annihilating frenzy with which he dives within himself, invades his image of nature, which he paints live and shuddering, full of vegetable impulses of unpredictable purpose and of secret forces that surge at every point of the existent. His strokes actually vibrate and seem to emit the mysterious murmur of what is incessantly originated in things and landscapes. So that the deep expressivity of his work achieves a creative balance between the revelations of the face and of the landscape which illuminate each other reciprocally. Nature thus shines with tints of human drama while man delves within himself with the aid of an implacable self-analysis that resembles the unchanging of a natural force, as may be observed in his self-portrait in the Laren collection and in the one dedicated to Gauguin, at the Fogg Museum, Harvard University. Van Gogh is aware of the kind of visions he has, in which man and nature are linked together, and this is why he declares to his brother Theo: "I am decidedly not a landscape painter; if I paint landscapes there will always be in them the trace of figures."15 On the other hand, Van Gogh knows that drawing is "the act of breaking away through an invisible iron wall there seems to be between what one feels and what one is capable of doing ."16 He proposes to cross that wall at the point of greatest difficulties, because these increase when one models faces. He remembers that it is difficult to know oneself, at the same time that he observes that "neither is it easier to paint one's self." Nonetheless, he decides to tackle this task: "I prefer to paint the eyes of men - he writes - instead of cathedrals, because in the eyes there is something that may not be found in cathedrals; even though they are majestic and imposing, the soul of man, even if he is a poor beggar in rags or a woman of the streets, is more interesting to me."17 In them he looks for something immutable which always appears to him out of a background of deep pain that is beyond pure melancholy. "I would like to paint man - he further specifies - with what 'I do not know what' of eternal formerly symbolized by the halo and which we look for in radiation itself, in the vibration of our colorings."18 More than in things, he perceives infinity in the appearance of men. Consistently</page><page sequence="29">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 207 with this, he represents human figures with the frenzy of he who tries to carry out something definitive, but which is also presented to him as inevitable defeat, as a force he must develop and which he cannot annul, though submission to it takes him towards somber experiences. That is why he acknowledges that in "certain situations it is better to be the loser than the winner, e.g., it is better to be Prometheus than Jupiter." This last statement interprets in a penetrating way the expressive sense of his own portraits, that teach the inevitable psychological fate of the tragic obstinacy there is in the aspiration to achieve a final self-confession; it reveals that this chains one to oneself at the same time that it allows a view of a mysterious ambiance surrounding the discovery of every new inner layer. The spiritual concentration he shows in the face of his self-portraits follows an intimate movement of deepening that resembles an irresistible turbulence. This is a resultant of the fact that Van Gogh looks upon the world with uncontrollable ardor, precisely because he experiences the anguish of perplexity when facing himself; he fears the illusion of the apparent selves he avoids, in his search of the authentic self that is ever more distant. Then he casts upon the world his flaming look, not finding peace of mind in inner meditation in which his personality turns into another the more fervently he delves within it. He is disturbed by the certitude of the illimited of the self; and, correlatively, when he contemplates the outer world it presents itself to him pregnant with secret germinations that impel each things towards its natural place, following animated sinuosities of vital concealed impulses. In short, fearful of himself, he pursues himself in nature and projects in it his anxieties. From there that his landscapes should appear externalizing a continuous inner evolution, as if physically deriving towards more complex forms of existence through a struggle of the elements which, because of its transfigurating virtue, is analogous to the intransigent persecution of himself. That is why his self-portraits point out in their eyes a beginning rather than an end, indicating a renewed challenge, a rebellion that borders the hatred on himself. The subjective course of this process of self-gnosis touches upon the unsurmountable doubt that he faces with daring. Lastly, that doubt becomes torturing distrust, turning into an endless psychological movement that impels ever onwards, because every step along the pathway to the re-encounter with himself still appears to him as being unauthentic. In this way he develops a peculiar feelig of distance from himself, stimulated by the skepticism derived form the certainty of the infinitude of the self, which is a quantitative metaphor to refer to the unknown in one. In his image of the world this attitude finds a deep correspondence in the unstable balance of the outline of trees and churches that burn and grow, shudder and breathe, because everything that exists likewise lacks boundaries, and things overflow the somber abandonment of the immutable. So that the painter establishes a significant harmony between looking outwardly and inwardly. Out of that relation the look surges as a reflection of the world. In his self-portrait mentioned above, in the Impressionist Museum, some blues and tenous greens</page><page sequence="30">208 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN impress on the space surrounding the head a movement of endless whirl that turns every point into a focus of intimacy, just as the look creates inner space with its increasing luster. Besides, the implacable severity he incarnates in harshly profiled features and the lighted violence of the beard and hair in bronze tones, lend to the expression of the face the characteristics of an elemental force. Van Gogh stalks himself in a world of teeming life that surges irresistibly. Such a harassment of himself, that borders on the tragic, symbolizes the agonized awareness of the unsurpassable disproportion between what is felt and what is done. That is why his figures express a will towards externalization that is almost delirious, compensatory of the experience of outer infinitude. So that the expressive deformations in which his work culminates are a sign of the torturing doubt concerning the existence of a final self. Van Gogh seems to have the intuition that the authenticity of a person may be revealed in the face only by outlining features that go beyond bodily appearance. He has the presentiment - to express it in the language of Hegel - that the exterior and the interior "only are an only thing ," that is, the unity of both "determinations of form." Because "the interior is not immediately other than the exterior, and it constitutes the determination of exteriority , just because it constitutes the interior; on the contrary, the exterior is only an interior because it is only and exterior. That is to say, in containing this unity of form its two determinations as opposites, their identity consists only of this crossing over, and in this consists only the other of both, not its identity full of contents}9 It might be suspected that as soon as the artist glimpses the unity underlying opposite determinations, he will pursue the identical in the revealing meaningful exteriority. Unknowingly, Van Gogh dramatizes the thought of Hegel, according to which what is a pure interior constitutes, for this reason, an exterior; and vice versa. He plastically represents this idea as the expressive dialectics of the knowledge of one's self incarnated in the exteriority of the face. In so doing, he reveals that both determinations essentially imply each other. Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider the mediation of appearance and opposition between the internal and the external in order to restore the unity of their immediacy. Van Gogh knows, furthermore, that the body is the intermediary that "puts in relation with external world," as Hegel accurately observes.20 Guided then by a deep expressive logic, he represents his face pathetically, in the extreme limits of bodily existence. He paints countenances that are tense almost to madness, because this ensures a possibility of incorporating oneself into the world and to fully experience it. He thus looks for a final refuge in outwardness, in confidence that this will actualize all its wealth, flooding it with expression. Animated by some sort of mysticism he thinks he thus favors his re-encounter in the corporal permeated with soul. Herein is another significant feature of the burning keenness of the looks with which Van Gogh peers at and searches himself, an illustrative example of which is to be found in his Detroit self-portrait. This essential relation between the way of seeing one's self and what is looked at in the world and in others, presents an unembraceable diversity. It</page><page sequence="31">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 209 points out, in every case, together with the difficulties of communication of man with himself, that the knowledge of self is only an expressive sign of the mode of being in the world. Let us remember that Durerò melancholy constitutes the psychological background of his self-portraits, out of which are elaborated some features that externalize the obsessive feeling of heterogeneity between one's self and nature, foundation of an abysmal experience when facing the infinitude of the interior and of the exterior, of the self and of the universe. Let us further analyze the lesson of Goya. In the first of his Caprichos (caprices) the painter represents himself full of a wounding doubt that floods the look he directs upon the world. He spills sarcasm on reality, showing a glimpse of his Titanism, which rises pridefully above the pettiness of others. His anguished eyes unmask corruption, expressing the presentiment of the collective moral fall, because of which they also exteriorize an experience of solitude impregnated with resentment. He perceives the world with a critical look and it might be said that he knows himself through the bitterness of subjective isolation, as if he himself could not at certain moments free himself from what he censures, despite his inner freedom. The satirical attitude re-acts on the intent of self-knowledge, evidencing, in this as in other self-portraits of his, the unsurmountable relativity of self-analysis, which always develops as a function of a determinate disposition when facing the world. Goya knows himself with the irony of he who lives unmasking hidden intentions and turning the face of others into a mask. Think of the Caprichos , where he displays a succession of images in which the grotesque and the fantastic alternate with the bestiary in which human and animal ambiguous forms pullulate, flaunting expressive deformities that border upon bewitchment. This spell manifests itself in the devilish distance that every being stubbornly keeps as regards his own nature, exteriorized through monstruous deformities that betray a descent of the individual to the level of the beast. As an inevitable consequence of this there stands out the impotence of his characters to link themselves at once with others, which has as an aftermath a breath of dissemblance that corrupts all ties. So that there is creative harmony between the self-portrait of Goya discussed above, and with which the Caprichos begin, and the announcement of the somber fact that nobody knows himself and which, furthermore, proclaims the reciprocal concealment that makes possible the hallucinating mascarade of equivocal relations, of tortuous and aberrant contacts animated by a sinister lewdness. This expressive gust of madness and wantonness can only arise out of a deep critical experience and of a refined sensibility to perceive the presence of evil. It finds its correspondence in an image of himself correlative of the prophetical impetuosity with which he contemplates the world, patent in the features of that self-portrait of St Bernardine in Sienna . In this work we observe that the strength of the look through which the artist tries to ummask the others exteriorizes a tendency originated in an anguished mode of knowing himself, that includes recognition of one's own mask. There is therefore nothing haphazard in the fact</page><page sequence="32">210 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN that the series of eighty Caprichos should begin with his self-portrait, which is a sign of a form of self-knowledge imbued with acridity, and a psychological harshness adequate to those visions that he will soon objectify in the drawings that follow his image. From there the justification of saying, together with Edith Hilman, that "to this exploratory process of new real and possible worlds corresponds the other complementary one of exploring and discovering one's self, which is perceived in the series of faces and masks that Goya reveals in the self-portraits he paints."21 Now then, the basic theoretical design of these considerations rests upon the attempt to investigate to what extent expressivity contributes to self- knowledge. That is to say, we must try to know how expressivity illumines what escapes self-observation, the look directed at the world and at oneself, just as it is manifested in the face in its immediate incarnation or in its artistic representation. The adoption of this perspecitve of analysis implies the clear différenciation of the various pathways that may be followed towards this discovery of the self. In every one of them we find peculiar limitations. Already the fact that the existential evidence of the self and the verification of the distance from oneself are compatible shows that there are different of self-reflection. We have, to begin with, the possibility of the cogito as self-evidence of the self that develops a metaphysical sense that differs from the analyses proper to the knowledge of intimate inclinations. But the mode of Cartesian reflection does not exclude autobiographically attending to the analysis of the motives underlying the acts, nor does it eliminate the will to clarify the conflicts between opposite longings. From where results the fact that in front of the cogito it is still possible to reach experiences of personal solitude, and to glimpse the psychological reflection of unharmonious relations with the others. As one of its directions, this process may culminate in peculiar attempts at self-gnosis, like the ones undertaken by Montaigne and Nietzsche. It is, besides, possible to aspire to discover oneself through the expressivity of words, as the dialogue of the soul with itself is carried out only thanks to them; lastly the face, with its expressive illimitability, also constitutes a source of knowledge, despite the characteristics of a veil inherent to it. In other words, there are different types and possible layers of the knowledge of oneself, from the discursive awareness, in the Kantian sense, passing through intuitive awareness and the analysis of the motives of acts, to expressive revelations. It is legitimate to affirm, as Kant does, that we only know ourselves as we know phenomenons.22 To this it may be added that in self-observation we are exposed to letting ourselves be deceived by illusions and delusions, as in the case of the knowledge of things. Max Scheler, arguing in this same sense, denies to the inner perception of oneself an evidence greater than to the perception of the external world. To the extent that he establishes an absolute phenomenological equality between perceptive and cognitive limitations, which affect the images of the inner world as much as those of the outer one. This is an equivalence and analogy that loses validity when carried beyond</page><page sequence="33">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 211 the inner world as much as those of the outer one. This is an equivalence and analogy that loses validity when carried beyond certain limits. Because even if one reasons, as Ryle does, in the sense, that erroneous judgments about our own states contradict the immediacy of the information delivered illusorily by our conscience and self-knowledge, it is no less true that the how of that ignorance of oneself constitutes a true source of knowledge, just as it is manifested in expressivity. It is necessary, of course, to establish the objective difference between the peculiarities proper to the discovery of one's self and to our knowledge of the world, as both possibilities present clear differential features. In investigations that point at nature we proceed through successive approximations which, because of their contents, scope and method, are qualitatively diverse from the process of increasing interiorization of man and from the mode of knowledge this implies. Seeing things and looking at the intimate, though both are fallible, represent types of knowledge that, direct or indirectly, display widely different characteristics. Self-observation understood in the empirical psychological sense rather than in the pure phenomenological one, supposes an ethical effort, an ascetic will, self-dominion, and great inner tension in spiritual activity, which is not equally inherent to the knowledge of the outside. Of course, the investigator of nature may take up his taks with an ascetic disposition. But the difference as regards the process of self-gnosis resides in the fact that attitude represents only one of the features of the personality of the savant, but it is not a mode of reference constitutive of the possibility itself of apprehending phenomenons, nor is it a specific category, as happens in self-analysis. In effect, in inner perception the vision of intimate processes and the type and intensity of self-control applied to knowing them, are complementary. That is, certain contents of intimate life are only known originally through a search that has, as a quality proper to it, an observation based on self-control, which structures a form of basic reference that transcends what is sentimentally accessory. On the other hand, that which evades self-observation is revealed by expressivity because it is up to the expressive movements to externalize features of the self that elude self-analysis. Let us see in what resides the possibility of this source of knowledge. We have already pointed out that the existential evidence of the self is compatible with our ignorance concerning the true inner struggle of motives; in truth, the intimate experience of inner states is sometimes associated with the ignorance of the causes that provoke them, which has an immediate consequence that a mask conceals the psychological framework of the true desires that impel the display of our personality. We are ignorant of ourselves as an ultimate ethical destiny through the same act in which we apprehend the reality of our existence. Now then, although expressions show the general rather than the singular, and psychic tendencies rather than the hidden motives of dispositions, they allow us to know ourselves beyond pure existential evidence that accompanies the fact of living internal states. Because as soon as expressivity actualizes ontological</page><page sequence="34">212 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN limitations of man, with a certain dramatic quality that is a function of its intensity, it simultaneously exteriorizes affective tonalities of the spirit that remain veiled to self-analysis. In contrast with what takes place in the cogito , which is a type of evidence, an irreducible primary datum, in a certain way, leading to the knowledge of the singularity of how one is, the countenance gives a translucent view of the concrete type of mode of being in the world.23 This means that the singularity of attitudes is discovered through that same expressive limit. In other words, the experiences that are externalized in extreme tensions simultaneously reveal the adequate key to decipher a meaning manifested in something inherent to the expressive-ontological limitations. So that in another's face, as when one contemplates one's face in the mirror, and when looking at a self-portrait, it is possible to perceive a personal destiny illumined by the expressive force that allows us to infer the structure of the conduct of the individual. In the diverse forms of human expressivity are exteriorized modes of relation of the person with himself and the universe. Through them we verify how the face of knowing oneself acquires a different meaning according to the changing type of the references to the self and to the world, which are always entailed. If we look at the first self-portrait of Durerò, painted by him at the age of thirteen and then analyze his images painted later, we may observe that the sense of contemplating himself evolves in a parallel way with the type of look he directs at the world. In general, it is easy to notice throughout his work the interdependence there is between the knowledge of himself and the traces left in his face by his varied contacts with the world. That may be verified, whether it be in the youthful features that still shine with the transparent lack of reserve of his adolescent artlessness, or in his last faces permeated with melancholy. Besides, the scrutiny of his individuality is linked together with complex intentions united to a determinate feeling of nature. Durerò asks questions of the real, and in so doing he interrogates himself; that is, he discovers himself at the same time that he exalts his individuality, animated by a Renaissance impulse. He looks at himself in the act of looking at himself. In Durerò there is a going beyond himself that shows him to his sight with an objectivity that only artistic expressions may attain. Starting from the first self-portrait, in which the astonishment concerning himself runs parallel with the one provoked by the innocent discovery of the world, the expressive self-analysis finally culminates in a song to melancholy. From there that in his maturity his face shows a deep sadness, whose apparent vagueness conceals a paradoxical absence of himself: Said melancholy is at heart the sign of a form of self-knowledge in which the infinitude of himself and of the world, perceived in their essential heterogeneity, condition a feeling of life as inevitable distance as regards the self and things. And the important point is that this is manifested as an expressive revelation. Rembrandt, another painter who greatly favored self-portraying, also achieves in the most elevated form this discovery of the world and of personal singularity. In his long series of works of this type we observe the slow process,</page><page sequence="35">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 213 not only of inexorable aging, but also of the keen representation of the course of life as the coincidence, every time more truthful, of the looking at himself and of the revelations of the real that modify this same self-observation. Starting from a look that is naïve, he soars, passing through degrees of increasing psychological complexity, until he achieves images in which the face seems to condense the experiences of the world and of the knowledge of himself. With that synthesis he exteriorizes a deep feeling of life that may be provided only by expressive self-gnosis. Rembrandt unveils through the physiognomic expression a mystery that remains impenetrable to self- observation: it represents the indivisible existential harmony of the look that looks at itself. In self-analysis, this unity achieved in the plastic simultaneity appears in only two opposite moments, awareness and its contents, or else it is manifested as pure existential evidence of the self. On the other hand, Rembrandt objectifies the double watershed of he who looks and what is looked at, modeling the face as an expressive integration of multiple reflective unfoldings. Passive portraying is surpassed by the self-contemplation of the physical features, and he masterly emphasizes the way in which the world penetrates within man, structuring the experience of himself as participation in the universal destiny of what exists. In these works self-knowledge borders on a limit of life through the experience of time. In them he expresses inwardness in a horizon of outwardness beyond which expression is no longer possible. He teaches that, to some extent, one knows oneself in the ignorance of one's self, at least as presentiment of the infinitude of the intimate, just as one acquires certitude of oneself in doubting. Lastly, Rembrandt physiognomically expresses the virtualities of a conscience that rests upon itself with beatitude, externalizing the double movement that Hegel considers proper to madness, in which the act of contemplating and what is contemplated become correlatives, as self-conscience that surpasses the negative moment of losing one's mind. Because in this alienation conscience places itself as object of itself, but in virtue of the indivisible unity of being-to-itself, it places the object as itself. "The alienation of the conscience of one's self - holds Hegel - itself puts the thingness, which results in that this alienation not only has a negative signification, but also a positive one; and that not only to us or in itself, but also to it itself."24 In an almost indescribable way, Rembrandt expresses this estrangement of the conscience whose dialectical cycle constitutes a return of it to itself, which becomes more profound in the process of delving deeping into intimacy, and which is verified through successive objectivations. In his self-portraits there shines an incomparable complementarity between the process of interiorization and the fact of objectifying himself. In them he conquers the upmost of expressive-wisdom, exteriorizing the dialectical movement of the conscience in which it is the totality of its moments. Herein we see coincidence between the dialectical nature of the process of self-knowledge and the theory of alienation, through expressive revelations which, because of their depth,</page><page sequence="36">214 FELIX SCHWARTZMANN transcend the reflective level. And, above all, it is evidenced how the possibilities of expressive incarnation extend to the most subtle processes of the spirit. VIII. The cogito and the knowledge of one's self These considerations leave us at the border of a matter that is crucial for the study of the self-portrait conceived as a synthesis of aesthetic emotion and the will towards self-knowledge. Whenever the dialogue with oneself adopts the form of a discovery of the self through the artistically objectified face, there appear essential phenomenons relative to the expressive resonances of the possible ties between man and the world, as well as to the aspect of the body as expression of the self. This train of thought illumines a wide field of problems proper to the knowledge of self, wherein self-analysis is signficantly associated with determined conceptions of reality. Nietzsche follows an ancient tradition of wisdom when he proclaims that man is a being that is distant from himself.25 In this sense, it is necessary to consider how that distance and the degree of proximity to the real are implicated. It is theoretically indispensable to examine the anthropological meaning of said complementarity between the fact of forging an image of oneself and the vision of the world if one aspires to understand what has been lived, through the effort of self-gnosis. Nietzsche states that the distance that every individual keeps as regards himself is relative to the ignorance of what takes place outside. He writes "Only when man has acquired the knowledge of all things will he be able to know himself, because things are only the frontiers of man."26 What may be learned from this correlation between the knowledge of oneself and of the world concerning the peculiarity of the act of knowing oneself? The attempt to solve the problem of what is experienced when obeying the Socratic imperative, constitutes a necessary first stage to know the character of self-gnosis. To be sure, it is not a matter of isolating only one introspective dimension, nor of explicating the metaphysical determination proper to the mode of referring ourselves to the existence implicit in the cogito. After these reflections, it is clear that we may not avoid the query concerning the type of connections that exist between the knowledge of external reality and the knowledge of one's self. Neither can we avoid the problem of the characteristics of the interdependence there is between these two forms of knowledge. So that things possess a double significant resonance: they condition an external horizon which, in its turn, determines variations of internal experience. That is to say, in the natural world facing the perceptive conscience, apart from the certainty of the existence of objects and of their symbolical manifestations, we verify that those external signs bring about an intimate commotion, because he changes in the sight of the physical environment of a person are always correlatives of new forms of the experience of the self. In fact, the contemplation of a quality proper to the landscape is followed by a singular</page><page sequence="37">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 215 perception of oneself, so that we may verify an essential link between natural vision and the experience of self. Every image of the outer world is associated with modes of conscience influenced by what is glimpsed through the look. The new perceptions thus condition renewed possibilities of self-discovery. Consequently, we cannot look upon things with metaphysical neutrality, because the pure visual contact with the landscape reacts on the state of mind, modifying the forms of internal experience. There now arises the question concerning the concrete way in which the new perceptions exert influence on the knowledge of one's self. In other words, we must attempt to know the way in which the consciousness of self is affected by variations in what is perceived in the natural world. Furthermore, it is theoretically justifiable to investigate if natural images condition changes in the experience of the situation and in the affective tone with which one is immersed in it, such that they may reveal to the individual unsuspected intimate inclinations. Describing now the track from subject to object, we verify that the feeling of the landscape is inseparable from a determinate conscience of one's self. Because contemplating, as Valéry acutely observes, is equivalent to imagining what one is certain of seeing, a fact that is valid for the painter just as much as in the case of he who is simply looking. So that the form of intimate wakefulness and the type of self-reflection prefigure, in their turn, the qualities that the horizon of reality will show. In this sense, the discovery of a different language is indissolubly associated with the revelation of original features within one's self; on the other hand, the fact of feeling as if one were reborn, invaded by an unknown vitality, is linked with the appearance of perspectives in the ambiance hidden until then. What is important is that this modification of the feeling of existence, correlative of the renewed image of the outer world, surpasses the level of a mere change in the existential intuition. It is defined, rather, as a process of self-revelation. He who feels and what he feels, he who re-discovers himself and what he discovers in the world, are psychological moments which are relative with regard to each other. So that the knowledge of one's self and the knowledge of the world do not constitute, taken by themselves, absolute points of reference, as both imaginary poles are dialectically implicated.30 NOTES 1 Plato, Teetetos, 189-e.

Concerning the problem of the relations between knowledge and one's self, psychical experience and configuration of oneself, see the work of B. Groethuysen, Phylosophical Anthropology , in which he develops his history from Plato to Montaigne. From a moral perspective, G. Gusdorf makes an analogous statement from Socrates to Freud in his work La découverte de soi P.U.F. de Paris, 1948. 6 Strindberg et Van Gogh, Minuit, Paris, 1953, p. 273. 7 Jaspers in effect believes that he can verify the astonishing fact of Van Gogh's attitude towards his disease. He affirms that in his lucid intervals he "dominates it sovereignly." He also thinks that the artistic evolution of the painter may be explained independently from his psychosis, in spite of it, "through a spiritual aim he possesed since its origin." that believes that nothing may be created on the basis of schizophrenia, unless the artist acquires a full mastery of his art. See op. cit., p.246, and on schizophrenia and the creations of the present age, pp.273 and ff. Lastly, let us remember as confirmation of what Jaspers points out, that Van Gogh declares in one of his letters that he is thinking of "decidedly" accepting his position as a lunatic, and in another one (576) he writes to his brother that "enthusiasm, or madness, or prophecy shake me like a Greek oracle on his tripod." 8 Goethe, Faust, Part I, scene "Peasants under the hidden tree." 9 On the expressive overflows of Van Gogh, according Aurier, a contemporary critic of the painter's see the long passages in his January, 1890 article, quoted by John Rewald in his work Post-impressionism from Van Gogh to Gauguin, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1956, pp.364 to 368. 10 Rembrandt, Ch. II "The non-spatial vision" Simmel also distinguishes the look that "is not directed towards any determinate object," that "turns upon the infinite," from the non-spatial look that "sees something that may not be fixed" at the same time that it is fixed on a point" that displays a pure inner quality. 11 Ethics , Part Five, Proposition LXLII. 12 Ethics , Part Four, Proposition LXVII. Marcel Brion has also studied this aspect of the work of Rembrandt, but without linking it to the concrete sense of the knowledge of one's self, see his Rembrandt, Albin Michel, Paris, 1946, pp.51, 253 and 255. Simmel, in his turn, has likewise described the experience of time in Rembrandt, particularly pointing out how his works leave the deep impression of a lengthy past that comes to like in the now of the artist. Rembrandt, Ch. I. "The continuity of like and the movement of expression." Titian , Phaidon Press, p.21. Let us remember that the historian Ranke, contrasting known facts, with the personages painted by Titian, was already aware of the extraordinary psychological penetration of the Venetian in the delineation of his characters with realistic wisdom. Also Burckhardt, in his Cicerone , judges as a "divine characteristic of Titian" his capacity to confer on things and persons "that harmony of existence there should be in them according to the essence of their being," design that he fulfills to the extent of achieving expressions that are full of profound need. So that the "peaceful paintings of existence" the auihor speaks about, are observed particularly in those creations of Titian that constitute works of religious genre, and in his feminine nudes, where there is serenity as regards the outer world and a feeling of unification with nature. Denying in these works the character of self-portraits does not modify in the least what is observed. Because though in effect they are portraits we always find the psychological traces of the author in the character that is represented, as may be seen in the determinate style that reflects it. In this sense, it may be said that many portraits conceal a self-portrait whose realization is inevitable for the artist as a consequence of his own style. 15 Letters, 184. 16 Letters, 237. 17 Letters, 441. 18 Letters, 531. 19 Science of Logic, Book II, C.

She investigates the ambiguities proper to his complex maskings and particularly, the fact of how in Goya the mask not only disguises but also at the same time reveals the authentic character of the persons, p.127. Kant states that the subject does not know himself in "what he is in himself' Critique of Pure Reason, par. 24. Kant distinguishes between realizing oneself and observing oneself According to him,</page><page sequence="39">A HISTORY OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEST 217 this last possibility leads "to exaltation and illusion." What is basic, for Kant, is that in the inner we never surpass the mere appearing to us in a certain way. On the other hand, he thinks we cannot help making "supposed discoveries of what we ourselves have introduced within ourselves." He points out, furthermore, that in the relations of an individual with others and he himself, self- observation conditions a kind of inescapable fiction. Kant thus warns us that the psychological peering at oneself threatens to turn us into actors. This happens as soon as the fact of peering desirous of achieving fidelity to intimate processes, leads us, through insuperable ambiguities, to the deformation of our own external image in front of our mirror; lastly, this condemns us to represent a role and to forge "a fiction of our own person." Anthropology, par. 4, 7. 23 Irreducible, in a certain way, insofar as the experience of the cogito does not necessarily imply the knowledge of the singular within oneself, of the framework of motives that structure the acts, nor of personal history. That is, not every experience of the cogito implies an apprehension of the singular, but every apprehension of the singular implies the cogito. Nonetheless, one may reach the pure cogito through analysis of concrete situations. That is why Descartes in his Discours de la Méthode establishes the methodic equivalence between conscience of being and thinking, after an historical analysis of the discovery of his self, after narrating what he calls the "fable" of his process of self-gnosis. He obtains basic evidence as a consequence of that analysis of personal history. In an analogous way, in his Meditations (Particularly in the First and Second) in order to find a starting-point that should be true and indubitable, he re-works the history of illusory certainties, whose final disappearance allows him to attain authentic evidence. He thus gets rid of mere opinions, rejecting everything that does not show a seal of true certainty, representing to himself his personal historical path; in his solitude and repose, he destroys false ancient conceptions that rest on imperfectly based principles. It happens as if the ultimate certitude of himself were found when leaving behind the stages of the history of the personal spirit. From there the significant asymmetry we pointed out: that the cogito implies transcending the personal, whereas the analysis and awareness of the personal cannot be conceived without the background of the evidence of the cogito. However, Descartes emphasizes the history of his individual conscience as the intimate pathway that leads to the cogito. That is why when in his Second Meditation he asks himself what is, in answering that it is a thing that doubts, conceives, affirms, denies, wants, does not want, that imagines and that feels. That is, starting from the cogito he glimpses the multitude of personal dispositions that constitute his nature. Which means that it is possible to remake personal historicity starting from the cogito , in the same way, just like one reaches it through the setting aside of apparent truths. In short, Descartes postulates the existential knowledge of one's self as self-sufficient to transcend stages of personal life and to infer them as virtualities inherent to the cogito. On the historicity of the Discours of Descartes, and concerning the autobiographical value of the "fable" that the philosopher narrates relative to the reconstruction of his inner life and to the process of his self-knowledge, see the commentary of E.
