<plain_text><page sequence="1">Harappans, Ochre Ware and the Copper Hoards In October, 1949, a new type of pottery ? ill-fired, thick, ochre washed ware ? mainly bits with worn out edges ?, which is now commonly designated as Ochre Coloured Pottery (OCP) was excavated for the first time by B.B. Lai from Bisauli and Rajpur Parsu, two copper hoard sites in Badaun and Bijnor districts of U. P. Soundings were made at these places in order to affiliate the copper hoard implements to some definite culture if possible. The copper hoard implements found from time to time were regarded by Heine Geldern as ? the archaeological traces of the Vedic Aryans ?. Stuart Piggot supported him at first but later changed his view and regarded the copper tools as belonging to the Harappan refugees who moved eastward after the break-up of the Harappan civilization. Lai made a typological and technological study of these copper implements and together with the evidence of Hasti napura excavations, reached the conclusion that the tools belong neither to the Aryans nor to the Harappans but to an altogether different people ? the ancestors of the Proto-Aus traloid tribes who occupied the region before the advent of the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) people. The copper hoard implements were tentatively associated with the ill-fired, ochre washed thick ware which existed at Hastinapura also underlying the strata containing the PGW, which Lai associated with the early Aryans in India. The discovery of a copper hoard and the occurrence of some red pottery deep under the ground at Bahadarabad in 1952, the existence of similar pottery at Bhatpura and Manpur, possessing strong Harappan affinities and the evidence of a broken anthropomorphic figure in the Harappan levels at Lothal led Dr Y. D. Sharma conclude that the Ochre-ware Culture together with its copper hoards was ? only a phase of Harappa ware ?,? the last phase of the eastern movement of the decaying Harappa culture ?. Revising his earlier stand he now takes Manpur and Bhatpura to be Harappan sites and thinks that the copper hoard implements ? were being supplied to the struggling Harappan people and others by local craftsmen ?. The discovery and excavation of some OCP sites have thrown some welcome light on the problem and a fresh interpretation of the available data has become a desideratum. The cfamily likeness5 of some painted designs at Bara with those of a pre-Harappan culture at Kalibangan was recognised some time back. The pre-Harappan influence has been noted on the pottery found at Mudiala Kalan and Kathpalon, two Harappan sites in Ludh iana and Jullundur Districts respectively. Baragaon in Saharanpur District has yielded a copper ring of the type reported from Pondi, Bahadarabad and Jorwe, an unslipped Ochre 147</page><page sequence="2">coloured ware, ill-fired slipped ware as also the typical Harappan pottery with black painted designs on red surface with typical Harappan antiquities. The pottery shows pre Harappan and Cemetery H influence also. Another OCP site in the same district, Am bakheri, has also yielded pottery betraying Cemetery H influence, Bara type of vases with flanged rims and antiquities suggesting Harappan ancestry. According to S. P. Gupta, the Bahadarabad pottery assemblage includes both the Late Harappan and the OC wares. How did the pre-Harappan, Harappan and Cemetery H elements mingle in the OCP? What is the significance of the occurrence of Harappan and OC pottery together? M. K. Dhavalikar has drawn certain conclusions from S. S. Sarkar's report on the skeletal remains of the Harappan civilization. One of the main conclusions is that the Harap pans came here in three waves. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to think that the first wave pushed some of the pre-Harappan people (who lived at Kalibangan and elsewhere) forward, or we may say that some of the pre-Harappan people who could not concile themselves with the new-comers moved forward. They left their original homes like refugees and setded on the north-eastern fringes of the region occupied by the new-comers. They, however, did not remain totally uninfluenced by the Harappans. That is why we see a mingling of the pre-Harappan and Harappan traits at Mudiala Kalan, Kathpalon, etc. Being the settlements of refugees they did not flourish much and remained comparatively small towns where poor people lived with their cheap, simple and ungaudy cultural equipment. Excavations should be made at these sites and samples for Radiocarbon tests should be collected. An? other wave of the same Harappan came, as a result of which some of the orthodox and ir? reconcilable earlier inhabitants moved forward or were pushed forward. These poor refugees produced the OCP which has sometimes been found along with the Harappan pottery that they might have brought with them when they fled from their original homes. Another possi? bility is that after some time, these refugees who used the OCP, improved their relations with the people who came in the subsequent waves and began living together at places like Bahada? rabad, Bargaon, Manpur, Bhatpura, etc. Some of the (previous refugee settlements too would have been affected by the second wave as a consequence of which we see the pre-Harappan, Harappan, Cemetery H and some local traditions joining together in their new settlements. Since the push was from the western and north-western quarters, the result was the move? ment towards east and south-east of the refugees who lived in poorer conditions with their jejune cultural equipment. The fact that not even a single site has yielded the OCP superim? posed over the Harappan remains gives support to the hypothesis that the OCP culture was contemporaneous with the Harappan culture. The distribution of the OCP sites on the fringes of the core of the Harappan zone or further east accounts for the desertion of the original homes and occupation of new places out of the central zone. The conditions in which they left their original homes and settled elsewhere well explains their poorer cultural equipment. Their relations with the Harappans and others are represented in the traditions met with in their relics. Now about the association of the OCP Iwith copper hoards. The two were associated 148</page><page sequence="3">together by Lai on the ground that the two sites he excavated to affiliate the known copper hoards from those places, both yielded the OCP. He, however, held this association only tentative. It was Dr Sharma who, on the evidence of copper implements and some red pottery from Bahadarabad, pottery showing Harappan affinities from Manpur and Bhatpura and the existence of a broken anthropomorphic figure in the Harappan levels at Lothal, held that the two ? the OCP and the copper implements ? are definitely to be associated with each other. There are, however, certain points which go against this association as a result of which Dr Sharma himself has revised his stand and does not associate the two. As indicated above, the Ochre-ware people were the refugees contemporaneous with the late Harappans and included amongst them the pre-Harappan, Harappan, Cemetery H and some local elements. We know that none of these people used any copper implements similar to those of copper hoard implements. The two categories are different typologically and technologically. So if the parent-tribes 'did not know the copper hoard implements Jiow could those who parted from them as refugees know of and manufacture those imple? ments suddenly? And why a sudden change from bronze to copper? The Ochre-ware people were poor people as evidenced by their cultural remains. It is very unlikely that they had the facilities and even perhaps the technical skill to smelt copper and make such tools. As suggested by Gupta the hoards originated somewhere in Bihar or Chhota Nagpur &gt;from where they moved into the Gangetic Va'Jley. It was here that they evolved a few new types like the harpoons, swords and anthropomorphic figures which are not met with in the eastern region. Had they spread from west to east, there can be no reason to explain the absence of these types in the east. So the copiper hoards cannot be associated with the OCP. Had the two been culturally associated together we could have got the OCP at almost all the sites which have yielded the copper hoards or reversely, copper implements from the sites yielding ochre ware. But it is not so. Many sites have been excavated but no copper hoard has as yet been obtained in regular excavations from any Ochre-ware site. The copper hoards belonged, as evinced by Lai, to the aboriginal tribes ? the Proto-Australoids inha? biting the region at that time ? and the OCP belonged to the Harappan refugees. At certain places they came in contact with each other and the result was the existence of the two at one place which led to their association. We thus see that the Ochre-ware people were the Harappan refugees, contempo? raneous with them and associated with the copper hoards chronologically but not culturally. Devendra Handa REFERENCES M.
