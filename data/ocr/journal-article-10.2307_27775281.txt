<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT PINSKY Robert Pinsky's Sadness And Happiness (poems) was published recently by Princeton University Press. Princeton will publish his book about contemporary poetry, The Situation of Poetry, next December. from "An Explanation of America" Robert Pinsky photo by Linda Mahoney (a longer poem addressed to my daughter) //. People In The Same Place All things have many explanations: "Not By co-operation Are Old Man's Winter Night," And "No Committee ever made a picture" ? And that is true. But in a way a poem Is a co-operation; words themselves, By which we are, imply a kind of contract. As, someone might explain a troubled time By saying "It's because they killed the railroads": Because a child who hears a whistle at night Can hear it drawing closer to the bed And further in a line, along a vein, While highways murmuring in the night are like A restless river, grown unpredictable A way that rivers don't. And yet the shadows From headlights as they circled my bedroom walls Have given me comfort too, the lights and whistle Like two different sentimental songs At night. And though the cars and highways do stifle The downtowns and their sweet co-operation (The City Bakery, the Paramount, the stores) I love a car?a car, I guess, is like One's personality, corrupt and selfish, Full of hypnotic petty pains and joys, While riding on a train i? like the mind, The separate reveries, the communal rhythm Of motion in a line, along a vein... The communal speed of trains and happy freedom In a car are like the troika, each making plain The great size of its place, the exhilaration Of speed which the size evokes?the schedules, pillows And porters on the train, the thrill of wit And aggression in a car, choosing a lane? And some day, tamed and seasoned, our machines Will make plain that America is a country, Another country like others with their myths Of their uniqueness, Tara and Golden Peru And Mother Russia, Finlandia and the Cowboy's Prayer, And even quiet Helvetia, equal together, A commonweal of places and their myths. And motion will be a place, and who knows, you May live there in the famous national "love Of speed" as though in some small town where children Walk past their surnames in the churchyard, you At home among the murmur of that place Unthinkable to me, but for the children Of that place comforting as an iceman's horse. Because as all things have their explanations, True or false, all can come to seem domestic. The brick mills of New England on their rivers Are brooding, classic; the Iron Horse is quaint, Steel oildrums, musical; and the ugly suburban "Villas" of London, Victorian Levittowns, Have come to be civilized and urbane. And so although a famous wanderer Defines a nation, "The same people living In the same place," by such strange transformations Of time the motion from place to place itself May come to be the place we have in common. The regions and their ways?like Northern Michigan And its Rutabaga Pasties, or Union City With its Cuban and Armenian churches?will be As though Officially Protected Species. The Shopping Center itself will be as precious And quaint as is the threadmill now converted Into a quaint and high-class shopping center. For place, itself, is always a kind of motion, A part of it artificial and preserved, And a part born in a blur of loss and change, All places in motion from where we thought they were, Boston before it was Irish or Italian, Harlem and Long Branch before we ever knew That they were beautiful, and when they were: Our nation, mellowing to another country Of different people living in different places. Sights and Atrocities A country is the things it wants to see. And so some part of me, though I do not, Must want to see these things, as if to say "I want to see the calf with two heads suckle; I want to see the image of a woman In rapid sequence of transparencies Projected on a bright flat surface, conveying The full illusion and effect of motion, In vast, varying scale, with varying focus, Swallow the image of her partner's penis. I want to see enormous colored pictures Of people with impossible complexions, Dressed, often, in flamboyant clothes, along The roads and fastened to the larger buildings. I want to see men playing games with balls. I want to see new cars; I want to see Faces of people, famous, or in times Of great emotion, or both; and above all, It seems, I want to see the anthropomorphic Animals drawn for children, as represented By people in smiling masks and huge costumes. Page 18 The American Poetry Review</page><page sequence="2">I want to shake their hands. I want to see Cars crashing; cards with a collie or a pipe And slippers, dry flies, mallards and tennis rackets? Two people kissing for Valentine, and then A nicky-nacky design, a little puppy Begging for me to like the person who mailed it." In Mexico, I suppose they want to see The Eyes of God, and dogs and ponies coupling With women, skeletons in hats and skirts, Dishwashers, plutocrats humiliated, Clark Gable, flashy bauhaus buildings, pistols. It always is disturbing, what a country Of people want to see... .In England once, A country that I like, between two Terms, In Oxford, I saw a travelling carnival And fair with Morris dancers, and a woman Down in a shallow pit?bored-looking, with bored And overfed, drugged-looking brown rats lolling Around her white bare body where it was chained Among them: sluggish, in a furtive tent. And that was something, like the Morris dance, Which an American would neither want To see, nor think of hiding, which helps to prove That after all these countries do exist, All of us sensing what we want to see Whether we want it separately, or not. But beyond the kinds of ball or billboard, or what The woman must undergo, are other proofs, Suggesting that all countries are the same: And that the awful, trivial, and atrocious (Those "forms receptive, featureless and vast") Are what all peoples want to see and hide, Are similar everywhere, and every year Take forms that are increasingly the same, Time and Der Spiegel, Chile and Chicago, All coming to one thing, whether sinister Or bland as a Christmas card from "Unicef/' What do I want for you to see? I want? Beyond the states and corporations, each Hiding and showing after their kind the forms Of their atrocities, beyond their power For evil?the greater evil in ourselves, And greater images more vast than Time. I want for you to see the things I see And more, Colonial Diners, Disney, films Of concentration camps, the napalmed child Trotting through famous newsfilm in her diaper And tattered flaps of skin, Deep Throat, the rest. I want our country like a common dream To be between us in what we want to see... Like me and some people I no longer know, After the fair in Oxford, at Tea time laughing Until we cried, four young Americans Hysterical at what the English seemed So hot to see: the hopping Morris Dancers And the Rat Girl dozing in her silly pit. Not that I want for you to have to see Atrocity itself, or that its image Is harmless. I mean the way we need to see With shared, imperfect memory: the quiet Of tourists shuffling with their different awes Through well-kept Rushmore, Chiswick House, or Belsen; "Lest we forget" and its half-forgotten aura. I want for you to see a "hippie restaurant" And the rock valley where a thousand Mormons Were massacred by other Mormons, dressed As Indians ?like the Boston tea-tax rioters Or like the college kids who work for Disney, Showing the people what they want to see.</page></plain_text>
