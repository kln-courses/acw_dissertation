<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRIME REPORTING AND PUBLICITY OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS TELFORD TAYLOR* British and American law and practice differ with respect to the publicity of criminal proceedings quite as much as, if not more than, they do with regard to other matters under consideration in this series of papers. In order to pre- pare some ground for comparison, therefore, it has seemed desirable to include in this paper a considerable body of material which is purely expository and, in at least that sense, elementary. This is especially true with respect to the description of the constitutional and federal factors which loom so large in the United States, and which have no parallel in the British approach to the problem. Despite the many points of disparity which will be remarked, the two principal negative policy factors are common to both countries. Publications relating to criminal proceedings may be deemed harmful because they (1) ob- struct the administration of justice in the particular case, or (2) scandalize or otherwise undermine the judicial system in general. As will be seen, British judges have been more sensitive to the second factor than have their American counterparts. On the affirmative side, the contrast is sharper. Widely in journalistic and measurably in legal circles, Americans entertain the belief that publicity may contribute to the integrity and efficiency of criminal proceedings. This view has not found much recognition in British theory and practice, but there are recent signs of an emerging awareness of these values. Following the historical and expository treatment, I have endeavored to sketch the current scene, and bring into the foreground those recent episodes and controversies in Britain and America which lend currency to a considera- tion of this subject. My primary purpose has been to select and specify those problems which are of bilateral concern. But while this paper is a memorandum rather than a thesis, I have also sought to indicate some departures from cur- rent practice or opinion which may perhaps be worthy of consideration. I. LAW AND PRACTICE IN THE UNITED STATES Although the historical authority for the proposition has been somewhat tarnished by scholarly research,' it is accepted in the United States as in Britain that courts have power to punish, by summary contempt proceedings, the * Professor of Law, Columbia University.

In the United States, however, the exercise of this power is very much restricted by constitutional provisions which apply to both state and federal courts (though perhaps not precisely to the same degree), and by congressional enactment applicable to the federal courts only.2 A. The Federal Contempt Statute More than a century ago, a federal district judge, James H. Peck of Mis- souri, in summary contempt proceedings, imprisoned a journalist who had criticized one of his decisions, then pending on appellate review. His action aroused great indignation and impeachment proceedings were instituted. The judge's age and physical disability contributed to his acquittal by a narrow margin in the United States Senate, but Congress promptly enacted a statute drastically limiting the summary contempt powers of federal judges.3 This legacy of judicial unwisdom is still the law of the United States, and in its present form limits the summary contempt power of the federal courts to "misbehavior" occurring "in its [the court's] presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice."4 There is an obvious question of con- struction of the words "presence" and "near": are they used geographically or in a causative sense? If the former, it is apparent that publication cannot ordi- narily be punished by summary contempt, for it is usually not committed in the court's physical presence or proximity. In 1918 the Supreme Court, by a divided vote, held that the causative sense governed, and sustained a contempt judgment against a Toledo news- paper which had commented tendentiously on a pending litigation.5 But a quarter of a century later, the Supreme Court, again by a divided vote, reversed its field, overruled the Toledo case, and held that "presence" and "near" were geographical expressions.6 The constitutionality of the 1831 statute was questioned on the ground that, under the doctrine of separation of powers, Congress may not deprive the federal courts of powers that are essential to the due performance of the judicial function. However, under Article III of the Constitution the lower federal courts are ordained and established by Congress, and in 1873 the Supreme 2.

Pa. 1835).</page><page sequence="3">36 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 66:34 Court held that this provision was broad enough to authorize the limitation in the 1831 statute.7 To all important intents and purposes, therefore, the federal courts have no summary power to punish statements and publications made outside their presence. It does not follow that statements which in other courts would be held contemptuous are entirely beyond the reach of the law, for they may sometimes be indictable and punishable under statutes relating to the obstruction and cor- ruption of justice. So, too, the federal criminal jurisdiction is very restricted compared to that of the state courts, and sensational homicides of the type that gives rise to the most acute problems of publicity rarely arise in federal courts.8 Nevertheless, it is worthy of remark that one of the two branches of the American judiciary-and indeed the branch thought by some to be the superior in dignity and calibre-has managed well enough for over a century without the power to punish contempt by publication. And this circumstance may per- haps help to explain the rather negative attitude which the Supreme Court has often taken toward state contempt judgments based on publication. B. The Constitutional Dimension Before examining those decisions, however, a few words about the consti- tutional framework are in order. Constitutional limits on the power of Ameri- can courts to punish contempt by publication stem principally from the first amendment. At least since 1927,9 it has been settled law that the first amend- ment's guarantees of freedom of speech and press are, via the fourteenth amendment, binding on the states.10 It soon became clear that this principle applied to all state agencies, including the state courts. Thus the question arises whether state court action adjudging a person in contempt for what he has said or written infringes the speech or press guarantees of the first amendment. The question is complicated by the operation of a countervailing constitu- tional force-the due process clause itself, in both its fifth and fourteenth amendment settings. Despite its amorphous contours, there is no longer any doubt that "due process of law" requires that criminal process be fundamentally fair to the accused. Furthermore, the sixth amendment gives the accused the right of trial before an "impartial jury," and while the extent to which the pro- visions of the sixth amendment apply to the states via the fourteenth is not fully 7. Ex parte Robinson, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 505 (1873). The Court remarked, however, that the limitation might not be valid as applied to the Supreme Court, the original juris- diction of which is fixed by the Constitution itself. The point is an interesting one, but has not subsequently arisen. 8. However, since the Second World War especially, there have been sedition trials (as under the Smith Act), and proceedings involving racial matters, which aroused much public controversy, so the distinction between the general characters of federal and state criminal proceedings suggested in the text is not nearly so sharp as it was formerly. 9. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927). 10. Whether the first amendment guarantees apply to the states in precisely the manner in and the degree to which they apply to Congress is a much-mooted question, but it is not of great importance for purposes of the present discussion.</page><page sequence="4">1966] THE DITCHLEY PAPERS 37 settled, there is no doubt that subjection to trial in a state court before a preju- diced jury-whether the partiality be the product of publicity, methods of selection, or other cause-may be deemed a violation of the fourteenth amend- ment. There are some who see in this situation a sort of constitutional impasse; it has been said that the first and sixth amendments are "on collision course."" Others take a categorical view of the first amendment guarantees and deny the power of the courts to prevent or punish utterances no matter how inflam- matory.'2 Probably more prevalent today are less absolute views of the problem. Restrictions on speech and press have been sustained by the Supreme Court in other areas, such as libel and sedition. There are numerous state court decisions affirming judicial power to punish contempt by publication.13 It is true, how- ever, that the Supreme Court has taken a rigorous view of the constitutional limits of that power, and to its decisions we now turn. C. Supreme Court Decisions The first and leading decision concerning the constitutional limits on contempt by publication is Bridges v. California,'4 which is really two cases. A prominent labor leader, Harry Bridges, in a public statement criticized a state judge's decision in a labor matter as "outrageous"; a large newspaper urged a state judge not to grant probation to two labor union agents who had been convicted of assault.15 Bridges and the newspaper were both held in con- tempt by the California court, but the Supreme Court reversed the judgments as invalid under the first amendment. Writing for the five-man majority, Mr. Justice Black applied the verbal formula originated by Mr. Justice Holmes,16 and held that neither utterance created any "clear and present danger" to the administration of justice.17 Dissenting with three others, Mr. Justice Frank- furter did not reject the verbal standard but differed in its application, saying that such utterances were a threat to pending litigation because they might have 11.

It is interesting that it was Mr. Justice Black who applied the "clear and present danger" test, in view of his subsequent repudiation of the standard. See Justice Black and First Amendment "Absolutes": A Public Interview, 37 N.Y.U.L. REV. 549, 559 (1962).

Although the "clear and present danger" formula has been modified or rejected in other areas (such as sedition), and has been disavowed by Mr. Justice Black, the Court has continued to apply it in subsequent contempt-by- publication cases. In 1946 a unanimous-for once-Court used it to reverse a Florida court's judgment of contempt against a newspaper editor who had criticized the court's administration of justice.19 A year later, by a 6 to 3 vote, the Court reversed a Texas court's contempt judgment against a newspaper which had criticized the court's decision as a "travesty of justice."20 In 1962 a Court, of which only three members had been on the bench in the Bridges case, dividing 5 to 2, reversed a Georgia court's contempt judgment against a sheriff who had criticized the judge's instructions to a grand jury investigating charges of electoral corruption.21 Of equal interest is a Maryland case in which a trial judge had held in contempt a radio station which had broadcast information about a suspect, ap- prehended on suspicion of murder, which the court thought prejudiced his op- portunity for a fair jury trial. The highest court of Maryland reversed the conviction, on the authority of the Bridges, Craig, and Pennekamp cases.22 The Supreme Court, by denying a petition for certiorari, declined to review that decision, but Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote a long opinion on the denial, and appended a memorandum listing and describing a number of English judg- ments of contempt by publication.23 Not since the now-discredited Toledo case of 1918, accordingly, has the Supreme Court upheld a judgment of contempt by publication.24 By invoking the "clear and present danger" standard, the Court continues to recognize the theoretical possibility of contempt by publication when that constitutional standard is satisfied. But in none of these cases has a majority of the Court found it to be satisfied, and this condition has persisted for a quarter of a century and through considerable changes in the Court's personnel. Justices Harlan and Clark, and the late Justice Frankfurter and Chief Justice Vinson had formed the core of the minority. Justices Black and Douglas have voted to reverse all of the six contempt judgments they have reviewed, and their views 18. 314 U.S. at 302. 19. Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331 (1946). 20. Craig v.

It should not be thought, however, that the Court's hostility towards con- tempt by publication signifies its indifference to the potentially adverse effects of publicity in terms of fair trial. In 1959 the Court reversed a criminal con- viction in a lower federal court on the ground that a newspaper, reporting matters which had been excluded from evidence, had found its way into the jury room.25 That decision was based not on the Constitution but on the Court's supervisory power over federal court procedure. Two years later, however, the Court unanimously held void, on constitutional grounds, an Indiana conviction where the press had built up community prejudice at the time of trial.26 And in 1963 the Court set aside a conviction for bank robbery where a local television station had broadcast the accused's pre-trial con- fession.27 In broad terms, the message that these decisions carry is that publicity be- fore or during trial may seriously prejudice the rights of an accused, but that these abuses ought, so far as possible, to be dealt with by some means other than summary contempt. D. "Trial by Newspaper" Although, as we have seen, the American state judiciary asserted and ex- ercised the power to punish publication by summary contempt untrammeled by constitutional limitations until 1941, actual journalistic practice followed a very different course from that prevalent in Britain. Just when the divergence began is a matter of scholarship beyond my ken, but certainly for more than a century it has been possible to criticize courts and publicize information and opinion, before and during trial, with a freedom quite unknown in England. The reasons for this lie beyond the scope of this paper; perhaps they spring from the nature of an expanding "frontier" society, in which judges are not Olympian beings, and the values of privacy and form are lightly held. The dangerous possibilities of pre-trial publicity were recognized by the bar many years ago, and the expression "trial by newspaper"-a phrase which is common currency as a description of the problem-has been in use at least 25. Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310 (1959). Mr. Justice Black was the only dissenter.

A Special Committee of the American Bar Association considered "ways and means of curbing excessive publicity in connection with criminal trials," but its report was concerned with the physical and other circumstances of the trial itself rather than pre-trial publicity.30 Three years later a sensational Baltimore case (the Tarquinio "torso murders"), and publicity abuses consequent thereon, led the judges of the Criminal Court of that city to promulgate a rule proscribing, as punishable by contempt, the pre-trial issuance by the prosecut- ing authorities or defense counsel of statements about the accused's conduct or admissions, or the "publication of any matter which may prevent a fair trial... ."31 These rules were never approved by higher judicial authority, and apparently were never put to the test of enforcement. A dozen years ago the New York trial of Mickey Jelke, a wealthy young man accused of procuring, led to spectacular and offensive publicity which aroused the New York County Lawyers Association. A Special Committee on Fair Trial and Free Press was appointed and proposed a "Press-Justice Code" designed "to eliminate the clash between constitutional press freedom and constitutional fair trial."32 The "Code" embodied twelve provisions, consisting largely of admonitions to the press not to seek advance information about testimony to be given at the trial, or express opinions on credibility, or publicize evidence excluded from the record, and to the participating attorneys not to provide such information or opinions to the press. This "Code" was hortatory only; unlike the Baltimore court's "Tarquinio Rules" there was no mention of contempt, nor indeed of any other sanction for violation of its provisions. Nevertheless, it was disapproved by the Newspaper Reporters' Association and sharply attacked by some newspapers, including the 28. Foster, Trial by Newspapers, CRIM. L.

Sensational, gaudily publicized trials stimulate an outburst of punditry and chin-wagging, often accompanied by press-bar recriminations. In terms of systematic effort to establish a frame of reference and project ameliorative measures, the results have been-exactly nothing. Such was the background of the problem when President Kennedy's as- sassination, and the subsequent apprehension and killing of his suspected as- sassin, Lee Oswald, raised the matter anew and more sharply than ever before. II. LAW AND PRACTICE IN ENGLAND I write with diffidence on this subject; fortunately, little is needed, for most Americans are aware of its general nature. In any event, the English legal structure is much simpler than the American; this is not to say that it is necessarily better. British practice has, of course, developed free of the express constitutional limitations which have been at work in the United States. To be sure, England has a constitutional tradition of free expression, but it is not in all respects the same as the American tradition. It is loose enough to embrace the Lord Chamberlain's censorship, and has not been offended by frequent exercise of summary contempt against utterances thought inimical to the administration of justice. In his opinion on the petition for certiorari in the Baltimore Radio Show case,34 Mr. Justice Frankfurter incorporated the memorandum, already men- tioned, encapsulating a number of English decisions. It is apparent from this survey that British judges have dealt summarily and often severely with public- ity deemed prejudicial to the conduct of an incipient suit, civil or criminal. Whatever Americans might think of the summary procedure and condignity of the penalties, few would quarrel with the basic policy. British practice also discloses instances in which the penalty was imposed not because of a publication's tendency to prejudice an incipient trial, but in order to vindicate the court's outraged dignity.35 The validity of this purpose would not be universally approved by American observers, and even those who accept it in principle might find particular instances rather draconic. 33.

See the discussion in, e.g., Goodhart, Newspapers and Contempt of Court in English Law, 48 HARV. L. REV. 885, 898-904 (1935); Laski, Procedure for Constructive Contempt in England, 41 HARV. L. REV. 1031 (1928).</page><page sequence="9">42 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 66:34 If a recent case may be taken as illustrative, the verbal standard applied in England is not unlike the one invoked in the United States. In Vine Prod- ucts Limtited v. Mackenzie &amp; Co.,36 Mr. Justice Buckley, dismissing a motion for contempt based on a pre-trial publication in a civil case, declared the power "should only be invoked where the risk of the proper administration of justice being interfered with was real and grave."37 This phrasing is not far from the "clear and present danger" standard adopted by the United States Supreme Court in the Bridges case. But, as often, it is not the wording that governs the outcome so much as the content infused by experience, and in the broad it is clear that British courts are accustomed to impose summary punishment for utterances which American courts would tolerate by habit, or by conscious restraint under the pressure of constitutional inhibition. On a pragmatic basis, the British system has worked well, at least in the sense that few complain. Recently there have been uneasy stirrings, dis- cussed in more detail hereinafter,38 but those who have most recently recom- mended changes do not propose to disturb the basic concept that summary con- tempt is a suitable procedure and sanction for the enforcement of standards.39 III. CURRENT PROBLEMS AND ATTITUDES IN THE UNITED STATES For over a year the American legal profession, the press, and others in- terested in public issues have been engaged in a period of self-examination, critical analysis, and occasional mutual recrimination comparable to those of earlier times described above. The stimulus to this new cycle was the aftermath of President Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, and especially press and radio coverage of ensuing events, leading to the slaying of the suspected assassin, Lee Oswald, while he was in custody of the Dallas police. Because of the tragic magnitude of the President's assassination and the naturally intense and pervasive interest in its details and consequences, public and professional concern with the subject has been deeper and more sustained than on any previous occasion. The Warren Report is the appropriate depar- ture point for a survey of the current situation. A. Lee Oswald and the Warren Report The circumstances in the Dallas Police and Courts Building following the apprehension of Lee Oswald are too well-known to warrant detailed repetition 36.

They were reviewed in the Warren Report,40 which described the condi- tion from November 22 to 24, 1963 as one of "general disorder," in the course of which newsmen "swamped" the corridors and many offices of the building, crowded around Oswald and shouted questions at him, and badgered officials to release more and more information.41 The police and prosecuting authorities released much information and misinformation concerning the evi- dence being accunmlated against Oswald, expressed opinions indicating his probable guilt, and eventually had started to move him to the county jail in conditions favoring maximum publicity, when he was fatally shot by Jack Ruby in full view of the television audience.42 For this sorry state of affairs the Commission laid primary responsibility at the door of the police authorities, but declared that "part of the responsibility ... must be borne by the news media" which exhibited "a regrettable lack of self-discipline."43 It made no specific recommendations, but concluded its dis- cussion of this aspect of the inquiry as follows :44 To prevent a recurrence of the unfortunate events which followed the assassination . . . more than general concern will be needed. The promulgation of a code of professional conduct governing representa- tives of all media would be welcome evidence that the press has profited by the lesson of Dallas. The burden of insuring that appropriate action is taken to establish ethical standards of conduct for the news media must also be borne, however, by state and local governments, by the bar, and ultimately by the public. The experience in Dallas during November 22-24 is a dramatic affirmation of the need for steps to bring about a proper balance between the right of the public to be kept informed and the right of the individual to a fair and impartial jury. Dean Erwin Griswold of the Harvard Law School subsequently expressed the view that: "Lee Harvey Oswald could not have obtained a fair trial any place in the United States . . . because of the nature of the television coverage in Dallas in the two days following the death of President Kennedy."45 With- out quarreling with this estimate, it is desirable to be quite clear about the meaning of "fair trial" in such circumstances. If one means that, in the state of the evidence as developed by subsequent inquiry, an acquittal would have been impossible, of course the Dean is quite right. But acquittals are often impossible or in the highest degree improbable where evidence accumulates damningly against a sole suspect, especially if the cause is one of sensational 40.

The test must be, rather, whether, if the evidence at the trial had taken an unexpected turn in another direction, Oswald would have had the benefit of the doubt, or been condemned because of the wave of feeling and opinion raised by the publicity. Had the Oswald case gone to trial, and had the evidence taken such a turn, I am not sure that an acquittal would have been out of the question. But the matter is highly speculative, and there can be no doubt that prosecuting authorities and press combined to make a Roman holiday of what should have been a dispassionate inquiry into a matter of the utmost gravity. In assessing the behavior at the police building in Dallas, however, one must bear in mind the extraordinary and numbing nature of the occasion. One may well ponder the events which might ensue upon the slaying of the Queen or Prime Minister, under circumstances whereby the identity of the assassin could not be im- mediately established, and a prime suspect was apprehended some hours later. However all that may be, the Warren Commission's emphasis on the obligation of bar and press alike to scrutinize and overhaul their handling of pre-trial publicity was taken seriously in many quarters, and we may now ex- amine some of the results. B. Studies and Manifestos At least half a dozen inquiries, under auspices which might be deemed responsible if not impartial, were put under way in consequence of the Warren Report recommendations. Perhaps the most likely source of an objective study, inasmuch as it represents neither press nor bar, is the Brookings Institution of Washington, D.C., which has embarked on a one-year study of publicity affect- ing criminal trials. On the professional side, the American Bar Association in December, 1964, established a Bar Advisory Committee on Fair Trial and Free Press under the chairmanship of Judge Paul C. Reardon of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. The Bar Association of the City of New York has only recently published a study of the radio and television aspects of the prob- lem conducted by a Special Committee under the direction of Judge Harold Medina.46 The fourth estate has been even more prolific of studies. In January, 1965, a five-man special committee of news executives, under the chairmanship of Mr. Theodore F. Koop of the Columbia Broadcasting System, was established to study "possible methods of curtailing the disorder often created by working journalists and technicians in covering news events."47 The following month the American Newspaper Publishers' Association created a 12-man Committee 46.

The report of this "Press-Bar Committee" was submitted to and unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Society on April 14, 1965, and it is therefore of especial in- terest as a reflection of the considered views of an important segment of the newspaper fraternity.49 The contents and conclusions of the report may be summarized as follows: (1) It is at least doubtful that pre-trial publicity has significant dam- aging effect on the fair-mindedness of jurors; (2) The press, by independent investigation and publication, makes an important contribution to the integrity of the judicial process by exposing its shortcomings; (3) Contrary to the recommendations of the Warren Commission, no code of conduct should be adopted by the press; (4) Laws or regulations governing the information which may be given to the press by police, prosecution, or defense may well go too far and "forge such shackles ... as to pinion the public...."; (5) Press revelations about the evidence against Oswald were amply justified by the public's right to know the circumstances of so cataclysmic an episode; and (6) The issue of "Free Press-Fair Trial" will be best dealt with by "energetic, frequent, and continuing conversations among those concerned," and by the press' own rededication to "the principle of reporting criminal trials with restraint, good taste and scru- pulous regard for the rights of defendants. ..." I will examine the validity of some of these points in the concluding sec- tion of this paper. For present purposes, it is most important to note that the authors of this report challenge the basic premises upon which the English and much of the American legal viewpoint is based. It should not be thought that the views of this Committee are unrepresenta- tive of the press in general. In numerous speeches, debates, columns and edi- torials, other journalists have expressed comparable views.50 Furthermore, 48. N.Y. Times, Feb. 4, 1965, p. 26, cols. 1-3. 49.

Dean Griswold proposes to utilize the legal canons of ethics, court rules, and the contempt power to prevent the "release of any sort of information about a person charged with crime, other than his identity, and the nature of the charge."52 The Philadelphia Bar Association has approved a "Statement of Policy" prepared by its Criminal Law Committee somewhat comparable to the Griswold recommendations.53 It is apparent from the foregoing account that the American bar and press are far from seeing eye to eye on the problem under discussion. But on occasion a considerable measure of agreement has been reached. In 1963, before President Kennedy's assassination, a "Guide for the Bar and News Media," formulated after more than two years of study by a Bar-Press Com- mittee, was issued under the joint authority of the Massachusetts and Boston Bar Association, the Massachusetts Newspaper Information Service, and the Massachusetts Broadcasters Association. Because it is based on an unusual consensus and covers many of the issues relevant to our subject, portions of the "Guide" have been reproduced as Appendix A. C. Judicial, Administrative and Private Action In consequence of the Warren Commission recommendations and the dis- cussion thereby generated, action bearing the stamp of authority has been proposed or initiated in a number of quarters, including judicial, executive, legislative and private agencies. On the judicial side, the most notable action has been taken by the Su- preme Court of New Jersey. In November 1964, in the course of an opinion on a criminal appeal,54 the court took occasion to make a general statement of judicial policy about pre-trial publicity: In our view Canons 5 and 20 of the Canons of Professional Ethics ... ban statements to news media by prosecutors, assistant prosecutors and their lawyer staff members, as to alleged confessions or inculpa- tory admissions by the accused, or to the effect that the case is "open and shut" against the defendant, and the like, or with reference to the defendant's prior criminal record, either of convictions or arrests. Such statements have the capacity to interfere with a fair trial and 51. See the remarks of the Hon. J.

State v. Van Duyne, 43 N.J. 369, 204 A.2d 841 (1964).</page><page sequence="14">1966] THE DITCHLEY PAPERS 47 cannot be countenanced. With respect to prosecutors' detectives and members of local police departments who are not members of the bar, statements of the type described are an improper interference with the due administration of criminal justice and constitute conduct un- becoming a police officer. As such they warrant discipline at the hands of the proper authorities. The ban on statements by the prosecutor and his aides applies as well to defense counsel. The right of the State to a fair trial cannot be impeded or diluted by out-of-court assertions by him to news media on the subject of his client's innocence. The courtroom is the place to settle the issue and comments before or during the trial which have the capacity to influence potential or actual jurors to the possible prejudice of the State are impermissible.55 It should be noted that, although the court's admonition extends to police and press, the reach of its sanction embraces only lawyers subject to the disbarment process.56 The United States Department of Justice, in April 1965, issued a "State- ment of Policy" binding on its own employees, portions of which are attached hereto as Appendix B. Presumably enforceable by reprimand, dismissal, or other disciplinary sanctions, the statement is an attempt to specify permissible and prohibited categories of information for release to the press. Comparable measures have been taken by the United States Attorney for Connecticut57 and the State Police Commissioner of Connecticut.58 In the legislative area, the most important development has been a bill introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon, and co-sponsored by fourteen other members, both Democratic and Republican, of that body.59 It proposes to add a new section to the federal criminal code, reading as follows: It shall constitute a contempt of court for an employee of the United States, or for any defendant or his attorney or the agent of either, to promise or make available for publication information not already properly filed with the court which might affect the outcome of any pending criminal litigation, except evidence that has already been admitted at the trial. Such contempt shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000. This bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and sub- committees60 held hearings on the bill beginning August 17, 1965.61 55. Id. at 389, 204 A.2d at 852. 56. Also lying in the judicial area is an interesting attempt by two men charged in Rochester, N.Y., with unlawful gambling to enjoin the publication of newspaper articles which, they argued, would preclude the possibility of a fair trial.

I have had no opportunity to identify other legislative proposals which, in all probability, are pending in state legislatures, other than a bill making it a criminal offense</page><page sequence="15">48 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 66:34 As for self-regulation by private agencies of press and radio, it is quite probable that a number have issued internal regulations or directives to guide their employees. However, the only one (so far as I know) that has been released for public scrutiny is a set of "guidelines" for the news department of the Columbia Broadcasting System, attached hereto as Appendix C; it will be seen that its restrictive aspects focus on pre-trial confessions and past criminal records. It is evident that none of the actions so far taken or proposed could be described as comprehensive. Senator Morse's bill is loosely drawn, but ap- parently is confined to federal court proceedings; its sanction is light, and it applies only to federal employees and attorneys. Except for the Massachusetts bill, to which reference has already been made, none of the measures or proposals seeks to apply any sanctions to the media of communication. As on the earlier occasions described above, the assassination and the Warren Report have resulted in much talk, but the practical consequences have not as yet been impressive. Meagre as they are, however, they reflect a deeper and more wide- spread concern than has ever before been manifested. IV. CURRENT PROBLEMS AND ATTITUDES IN ENGLAND Although there has been no criminal event in Britain of magnitude and gravity comparable to President Kennedy's assassination, the past few years have not been devoid of episodes and trends which seem to have induced a reassessment of certain aspects of criminal procedure. I speak of these matters from an abundance of ignorance, and have sought to do little more than enumerate a number of matters which should, I believe, furnish circumstantial substance for reflection on the general problem. A. Increase in Crime Some of the factors which seem to me to be relevant are only indirectly connected with the problem of publicity. Of these, the most notable is the rise in the British crime rate, coupled with the drop in the proportion of crimes "solved." The annual report of the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for 1964 showed an increase of 16.9%o in crimes of violence, and a decline from 43.1%o to 39.6%o in the cases of all kinds cleared up.62 Even more alarming statistics are given in an article on the rising crime rate recently published by Lord Shawcross, the former Attorney-General.63 Motivated by this trend, Lord Shawcross proposes very extensive alterations in traditional British methods to publish or broadcast information concerning confessions by or past criminal records of arrested persons, which, according to the N.Y. Times, April 15, 1965, p. 40, col. 4, received "initial approval" in the Massachusetts House of Delegates. 62. The Times (London), July 21, 1965, p. 6, cols. 6-7. 63.

It has not yet been explicitly suggested that, for better crime detection, it would be advantageous to relax the traditional ban on pre-trial publicity. Yet public dissatisfaction with the performance of the police and the courts in checking crime is very likely to result in more extensive press comment on and criticism of these very matters. Lord Shawcross again, in a recent address to the International Press Institute,64 spoke of "the duty of the press to exercise a surveillance over the administration of justice." B. Libels, Official Secrets, and Secret Committals The Justice report previously mentioned dealt extensively with the present law relating to libels and official secrets, and in both areas made recommenda- tions intended to give the press greater freedom of publication.65 Qualified approval was given these recommendations in an editorial in The Times on June 26, 1965. At about the same time, unfavorable comment in Parliament and in the press was caused by the secret committal for contempt of a man who had vio- lated a wardship order. The consequence was an amendment to the court rules, under which in all such cases the identity of the culprit and the nature of his offense must be stated in open court.66 Once again, these matters are only collaterally related to pre-trial pub- licity. Yet they are significant, I believe, as indicating a growing recognition that the press may have an important therapeutic role in the administration of justice. Indeed, this point was explicitly made in connection with the change in the court rules on secret contempt committals, which appears to have been stimulated by the vigilance and persistence of a courtroom reporter.67 C. The Stephen Ward Case The press also played a large part in the sequence of events that has become known as "the Profumo affair," many of the circumstances of which were set out in Lord Denning's report.68 For present purposes, however, primary interest attaches to an outgrowth of the affair, the trial and conviction of Stephen Ward on a charge of living off the earnings of prostitutes. Whatever may have been the motives and circumstances which caused the authorities to lay the criminal charge against Ward, few have commended the 64.

DENNING, THE PROFUMO-CHRISTINE KEELER AFFAIR (1963).</page><page sequence="17">50 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol.66:34 handling of the trial itself, and its conduct on the part of police, prosecution, and bench has been strongly condemned in a recently published study of the trial by Ludovic Kennedy.69 In substance, he asserts that: (1) Pre-trial publicity, and especially publication of the testimony given at the preliminary committal proceedings, made it difficult if not impossible to impanel an impartial jury; (2) Improper pressures were brought to bear by the police in order to induce witnesses of dubious character and credibility to give testimony supporting the charge against Ward; (3) The trial judge, by manner and in the content of his instructions to the jury, gravely prejudiced Ward's cause; and (4) After the trial and Ward's suicide, a veil of official secrecy was drawn over the matter, to the extent that the author was denied access to the transcript of proceedings.70 I do not presume to assess the validity of these charges, and can say only that, so far as I know, they have gone publicly undenied. Indeed, to me, the most surprising aspect of the matter is that the publication of such shocking allegations has aroused so little official or public attention. Surely it cannot be in the interests of justice to sweep such dirt, if dirt there be, under the rug. For purposes of the present subject, the experience of the Ward case suggests at least two questions: (a) is the publication of the evidence given at pre-trial committal proceedings prejudicial to the fairness of the trial itself, and (b) might the press have played a more effective part in detecting and exposing abuses in the conduct of the trial? If so, was the press inhibited by the fear of contempt proceedings? Has the contempt power been so exercised in the past that the British press tends to concentrate its attention on sensational or sordid factual details, rather than on the intrinsic integrity of the judicial process ?71 D. Committee Reports and Recommendations The first of the questions stated above has been recently treated in the Tucker and Byrne Committee recommendations. I have not had access to these reports, but from news reports and other sources I gather that the Tucker Committee proposed that testimony in preliminary hearings should no longer be publishable, unless the prosecution is dismissed, and that the Byrne Com- mittee proposes the use of declarations and depositions in committal proceed- ings, in lieu of oral testimony.72 The present Government's decision to support legislation designed to carry out these recommendations appears to have en- 69.

It may come as a surprise to most American lawyers, as it did to me, that in England the record of a trial is not a public record in the sense that it is in the United States. If no appeal is taken, ordinarily the trial record is not transcribed from the re- porter's notes. In that event, copies can be obtained only by permission of the court, which in fact was denied to Mr. Kennedy. 71. See the excellent discussion of some of these issues in Lewis, supra note 64. 72.

Times, Jan. 22, 1965, p. 12, col. 4, and the discussion in Lewis, supra note 64.</page><page sequence="18">1966] THE DITCHLEY PAPERS 51 countered some criticism from the press and, if I am correctly informed, from the Lord Chief Justice as well.73 I do not presume to pass on the merits of these issues, which do, however, appear to be eminently suitable subjects for consideration in connection with the subject at hand.74 The more general questions stated above, bearing on the proper role of the press in the administration of justice, were considered in the recent Justice report.75 The report noted "a considerable divergence of opinion both as to the extent of comment on judicial proceedings that a newspaper can safely and properly make, and as to the deterrent effect of the law of contempt in prac- tice." Despite this divergence, the report concluded (without expressed dissent) that, as regards comment on imminent or pending trial proceedings, "no change in the law is either practicable or desirable." The report does, how- ever, exhort the press to extend and intensify its scrutiny of court proceedings, and goes so far as to "support the view of one Editor who said that if a criti- cism needed to be made, the Press should have the courage to make it and risk the consequences." Finally, the report also recommends that "proceedings for contempt in relation to publications in newspapers and journals should be brought only on the instructions or with the leave of the Attorney General." This last proposal drew unfavorable editorial comment on the ground that "it would give new powers to the holder of a politico-legal office."7" The sug- gestion that the press should screw up its courage and "risk the consequences" is commented on below.77 V. SOME GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE OBSERVATIONS It is my hope that the foregoing pages have set forth enough historical and current material to provide a factual matrix for discussion of the general prob- lem. In order to give this presentation a bit of thrust, I am adding here some observations reflecting my own opinions on several issues of fact or principle suggested by the recent developments. A. The United States: Mass Media Triumphant If the fair trial-free press issue in America be regarded as a conflict be- tween the claims of the bar and the press, an observer must conclude that the press has won the game hands down. In part this victory has been handed to 73. See Lewis, supra note 64, and the editorial in The Times (London), January 22, 1965, p. 13, col. 2. The Law Society (solicitors) has also taken a position in opposition to the Tucker proposals. Law Society, Press Reports of Committal Proceedings, Memo- randum (July, 1965). 74. Connection between the matter of preliminary hearings and that of publicizing pre-trial confessions is shown by the committal proceedings in connection with the theft of Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington, wherein it was testified, and publicly re- ported, that the defendant had confessed.

The Justice recommendations on contempt of court are set forth in Appendix E.</page><page sequence="19">52 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 66:34 the press by the bar; the votes of legislators (among whom are many lawyers) in 1831 for the federal contempt statute, and the votes of Supreme Court justices in 1941 in the Bridges case, alike demonstrate a pervasive and enduring awareness among lawyers charged with public responsibility of the importance of a bold and outspoken press in the American scheme of things. But the impetus of these triumphs has now carried pro-press attitudes much further. It is noteworthy that neither the New Jersey Supreme Court, nor the Philadelphia bar, nor the Attorney General of the United States, nor Dean Griswold, nor Senator Morse, have, in their recent actions and proposals stimulated by the Warren Report, ventured to impose any sanctions on the media of communication themselves. In all these cases,78 the sanctions are visited only on lawyers and public employees to restrain them from releasing to the press information thought harmful to the course of justice. Far from being mollified by the restricted impact of these proposals, many agencies and spokesmen of the press have sharply attacked them as unwar- ranted restrictions on the public's "right to know." This phrase has attained wide currency, but its content is in part specious because its contours are so amorphous that it can be invoked to support extreme positions and dubious ends. Of course, the decisions of courts or public officials about the release of information are themselves proper subjects of press scrutiny and criticism. But this is an area where press opinion may be affected by conflict of interest, which may account for the shrill tone of much press comment on proposed restric- tions. However that may be, it is significant, and not a little ironic, that what first appeared to be an issue of whether or not restrictions should be applied to the press has now emerged as a question of whether or not the press will permit the bar to restrict itself. Whether or not such restrictions be desirable, it is apparent that the press has reacted to the events in Dallas and the comments in the Warren Report aggressively and with considerable tactical skill. B. Pre-Trial Publicity: The Problem of Measurable Damage Basic to the bar's traditional attitude toward pre-trial publicity is the belief that it may prejudice the opportunity for a fair trial, whether by diffusing hatred for or sympathy with the defendant or other parties, or by publicizing matters which are inadmissible in evidence. Most lawyers have taken this con- clusion for granted, but now it is challenged, in whole or in part, by spokesmen for the press who oppose restrictions on what they may publish. The report of the Press-Bar Committee of the ASNE,79 for example, declares that: "Con- 78. An exception is the bill pending in the Massachusetts legislature, mentioned note 53 supra. 79. See note 43 supra.</page><page sequence="20">1966] THE DITCHLEY PAPERS 53 vincing or even credible evidence on the degree to which press coverage of criminal proceedings injures the chances of fair trials for defendants is almost totally lacking," and discounts "the seriousness of the problem" on the ground that most criminal proceedings draw no press comment at all. The report acknowledges the possibility that "a handful of defendants each year" might be prejudiced, and that if so, it would be "a handful too many"-certainly not an alarmist attitude. Trial lawyers who continually work with jurors on voir dire are likely to take a different view, but of course personal impressions are no substitute for statistical proof, especially when dealing with journalists prone to discount pro- fessional pretensions as ritualistic humbug. The ASNE is right in pointing out that the bar has taken the validity of its main point for granted, and in suggest- ing that the need for restrictions should be more solidly demonstrated. Otherwise, however, I believe that the ASNE attitude, reflections of which can be found in many other press circles, is quite wide of the mark. Their con- clusion that only "a handful" of cases are affected is, of course, itself quite un- proven, and I think rests on the unwarranted assumption that harm may be done only in major, sensational cases. This premise is unfounded; indeed, there are trials going on in all parts of the United States that attract no national press coverage, but where local publicity may be very damaging to jury impar- tiality.80 Furthermore, the "handful" of notorious cases has an importance far beyond the numerical dimension, for such cases and their handling set the tone and standards for many others. In the public eye, the integrity of the judicial process is a function of the few cases that are widely reported, and it takes only a few bad apples to rot the whole barrel. Nor is specific proof of the damaging effect of pre-trial publicity on jury impartiality altogether lacking. In an 1895 murder trial in New York City, it was necessary to examine 460 veniremen to obtain twelve ostensibly qualified jurors.8' In an Indiana trial recently reversed by the Supreme Court on publicity grounds, the toll of veniremen was equally high.82 Furthermore, in such cases there can be no assurance that the jurors impanelled were in fact as unaffected by the publicity, or ignorant of it, as they claimed to be. Certainly no American lawyer who has tried a few cases with sharp racial or political overtones would have much doubt about the reality of the damage 80. E.g., one of the three cases in which the Supreme Court reversed a criminal con- viction on grounds of injurious publicity was Marshall v. United States, 360 U.S. 310 (1959), in which the defendant was tried in Colorado for dispensing drugs without a permit. It is very doubtful that such a case would be covered other than locally, or would figure in any known "handful" of cases. Whether there are many or few comparable cases should be ascertained rather than assumed 81. Note, 34 N.Y.U.L. REV. 1278, 1290 n.78 (1955). 82. Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 725 (1961). Over 400 veniremen were called before a jury was impanelled; the record on voir dire totalled 2783 pages; eight of the twelve jurors thought the defendant guilty at the time they were chosen.</page><page sequence="21">54 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 66:34 that pre-trial publicity can work.83 Nevertheless, methodical and documented studies of the matter are very much in order if a case convincing to legislators in particular and the public in general is to be made. C. The Press and Voluntary Self-Regulation The Warren Report explicitly recommended the adoption of "a code of professional conduct governing representatives of all news media." The Press- Bar report of the ASNE equally explicitly rejected the recommendation: "We are persuaded that no set of specific rules can be written into a code of press conduct that will not do more harm than good . . . the solution to whatever problems of Free Press-Fair Trial that may exist will not be solved by such codes."84 But in a speech to the Inland Press Association, Mr. Clifton Daniel of The New York Tines took a more optimistic view. Conceding that he could "envision no machinery that would guarantee the absolute enforcement" of such a code, he nevertheless predicted that "it would finld general acceptance in the profession as a whole."85 Division of opinion within the newspaper world about the desirability of self-regulation casts considerable doubt on the possibility of gaining acceptance for a code of sufficient precision to be effective. But in my view there are still other factors which strongly suggest that reliance upon voluntary self-regula- tion is based on wishful thinking and an anthropomorphic conception of the press. For the press is not an entity. It has no collective conscience for the evolu- tion of moral standards. It is not organized as a profession like the law, medi- cine, or military, from which individuals may be expelled for departure from accepted and enforced standards of conduct. To be sure, there are numerous associations of members of the press, but the press itself is an aggregate, com- posed of reporters, editors, and publishers, and, of course, news broadcasters and broadcasting executives, with the widest possible range of tastes and standards, and catering to very different audiences. There is sharp competition for both news and readers. Gresham's law operates with a vengeance; the exercise of commendable restraint in refraining from a particular publication may mean only that one's nearest competitor gets a scoop. Whether or not restrictions should be imposed on the press may be as- sumed to be a debatable question. But if such restrictions are deemed desirable, then, in my view, they cannot be accomplished by voluntary "codes" or self- regulation in any other voluntary form. Sanctions of some sort are needed to enforce whatever restrictions are thought necessary. 83. I am aware that my argument drawn from jury voir dire is not as meaningful in England, where jurymen are commonly accepted out of the draw. 84.

The Press as an Aid to the Judicial Process Central to press objections to restrictions on trial and pre-trial publicity is the thesis that the press, by scrutiny and publication, safeguards and improves the judicial process. This may be accomplished by exposing abuses and in- justices, by independent investigations leading to the disclosure of new and pertinent facts, or in other ways. The validity of these claims rests on personal impressions and inferences rather than statistical demonstration. The parallel to the situation with respect to the bar's belief that publicity may damage jury impartiality is apparent. In my opinion, there is substantial basis for both sets of claims, but far more needs to be determined about each of them. Does the press make a contribution to the fair handling and outcome of as many as or more than a "handful" of cases each year? In what areas are the benefits of press coverage most significant? Cer- tainly a more precise knowledge of these matters would be of great importance in defining the permissible limits of press comment and independent investiga- tion, and in specifying sanctions. The Justice report takes the view that the British press "may have been unduly cautious" in its scrutiny and analysis of the judicial process, with such excessive caution due to fear of contempt prosecutions. The remedy suggested is that the newspapers should be prepared to risk the consequences "of what- ever criticism they think necessary." I am not altogether clear about the mean- ing of this proposal. Of course the law of contempt is not black-and-white, and perhaps all that is being suggested is that editors should not gag themselves on account of remote possibilities of contempt. But if it is suggested that a news- paper should disregard competent legal advice that a publication will involve serious risk of contempt, one must ask to what end will such martyrdom be directed? Would not statutory reform be preferable to such an open conflict between press and bench? It is of course difficult to frame explicit standards to distinguish permis- sible from impermissible criticism. Lord Atkin declared that one must act in good faith and refrain from attributing "improper motives" to judges ;86 this suggests that it is safe for a fool to call a judge a fool, but risky for a sage to call a judge a knave. What would a British judge do about a private individual who had criticized one of the judge's opinions in the following terms :87 Speaking from considerable experience . . . I assert with deep regret, but without the slightest fear of disproof, that certainly in modern times Judge Thayer's opinion stands unmatched for dis- crepancies between what the record disclosed and what the opinion conveys.

CONCLUSION Rather than conclude this survey with an abbreviated restatement of the foregoing observations, it will, perhaps, be more valuable to set forth the ques- tions to which the attention of those concerned with the subject can be most profitably directed. A consideration of the factual issues would appear to be the proper place to begin; for not until we know the evils that must be combatted can we fruitfully approach the trickier problem of sanctions. First, it seems to me, we must devise new or adapt existing research techniques so as to establish more precisely the nature and scope of the dangers that publicity poses to the judicial process. How can these dangers be best stated in order to enlighten the public and persuade the press, rightly jealous of its freedom, of their validity? How can their particulars-for example, the publication of evidence which may be inadmissible-be isolated so that regula- tions or statutes may be tailored to realities ? Similarly, we must evaluate the nature and scope of the press contribution to the judicial process, and examine under what circumstances and by what means these values have been demon- strated in the past. To what extent would these values be enhanced by easing or jeopardized by increasing the existing restrictions in England and the United States, respectively? With regard to sanctions, we must consider whether legislation is the suitable vehicle for the specification of standards, or whether the flexibility of case-by-case adjudication is preferable. Perhaps even more elementary, to whom should these legislative pronouncements or judicial decrees be ad- dressed; is the present trend in American thinking-to concentrate sanctions on the bar and leave the press untrammelled-a sound one? The sanctions available are many: summary contempt, indictment and jury trial for contempt (perhaps only under statutes specifying particular abuses?), disbarment, or professional self-regulation; and we must decide which or what combination of these or other devices is most suitable. Without an extensive factual inquiry, these questions are difficult, if not impossible, to answer. But raising them is, of course, the first step toward their resolution.</page><page sequence="24">1966] THE DITCHLEY PAPERS 57 APPENDIX A MASSACHUSETTS GUIDE FOR THE BAR AND NEWS MEDIA 1. Guide for Press Preamble 1. To promote closer understanding between the bar and the press, especially in their efforts to reconcile the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press and the right to a fair, impartial trial, the following mutual and voluntary statement of principles is recommended to all members of both professions. 2. Both professions, recognizing that freedom of the press is one of the funda- mental liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, agree that this fundamental freedom must be zealously pre- served and responsibly exercised subject only to those restrictions designed to safeguard equally fundamental rights of the individual. 3. It is likewise agreed that both the press and the bar are obliged to preserve the principle of the presumption of innocence for those accused of wrong- doing pending a finding of guilty. 4. The press and the bar concur on the importance of the natural right of the members of an organized society to acquire and impart information about their common interests. 5. It is further agreed, however, that the inherent right of society's members to impart and acquire information should be exercised with discretion at those times when public disclosures would jeopardize the ends of justice, public security and other rights of individuals. 6. The press and the bar recognize that there may arise circumstances in which disclosures of names of individuals involved in matters coming to the atten- tion of the general public would result in personal danger, harm to the reputation of a person or persons or notoriety to an innocent third party. 7. Consistent with the principles of this preamble, it is the responsibility of the bar, no less than that of the press, to support the free flow of information. For the Press Newspapers in publishing accounts of crimes should keep in mind that the accused may be tried in a court of law. To preserve the individual's rights to a fair trial, news stories of crime should contain only a factual statement of the arrest and attending circum- stances. The following should be avoided: 1. Publication of interviews with subpoenaed witnesses after an indictment is returned. 2. Publication of the criminal record or discreditable acts of the accused after an indictment is returned or during the trial unless made part of the evi- dence in the court record. The defendant is being tried on the charge for which he is accused and not on his record. (Publication of a criminal record could be grounds for a libel suit.) 3. Publication of confessions after an indictment is returned unless made a part of the evidence in the court record. 4. Publication of testimony stricken by the court, unless reported as having been stricken.</page><page sequence="25">58 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 66:34 5. Editorial comment preceding or during trial, tending to influence judge or jury. 6. Publication of names of juveniles involved in juvenile proceedings unless the names are released by the judge. 7. The publication of any "leaks," statements or conclusions as to the inno- cence or guilt, implied or expressed, by the police or prosecuting authorities or defense counsel. 2. Guide for Broadcasting Industry [The "Guide" for the "broadcast news media" incorporates in nearly identi- cal language the principles proposed to govern the conduct of the "press."] 3. Guide for the Bar To preserve the individual's rights to a fair trial in a court of law the fol- lowing guidelines are prescribed for the Bar. 1. A factual statement of the arrest and circumstances and incidents thereof of a person charged with a crime is permissible, but the following should be avoided: (A) Statements or conclusions as to the innocence or guilt, implied or expressed, by the prosecuting authorities or defense counsel. (B) Out-of-court statements by prosecutors or defense attorneys to news media in advance of or during trial, stating what they expect to prove, whom they propose to call as witnesses or public criticism of either judge or jury. (C) Issuance by the prosecuting authorities, counsel for the defense or any person having official connection with the case of any statements rela- tive to the conduct of the accused, statements, "confessions" or ad- missions made by the accused or other matters bearing on the issue to be tried. (D) Any other statement or press release to the news media in which the source of the statement remains undisclosed. 2. At the same time, in the interest of fair and accurate reporting, news media have a right to expect the cooperation of the authorities in facilitating ade- quate coverage of the law enforcement process. APPENDIX B Office of the Attorney General Washington, D. C. STATEMENT OF POLICY CONCERNING THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION BY PERSONNEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RELATING TO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS [28 C.F.R. ? 50.2 (1965)] The availability to news media of information in criminal cases is a matter which has become increasingly a subject of concern in the administration of criminal justice. The purpose of this statement is to formulate specific guide- lines for the release of such information by personnel of the Department of Justice.</page><page sequence="26">1966] THE DITCHLEY PAPERS 59 1. These guidelines shall apply to the release of information to news media from the time a person is arrested or is charged with a criminal offense until the proceeding has been terminated by trial or otherwise. 2. At no time shall personnel of the Department of Justice furnish any statement or information for the purpose of influencing the outcome of a defendant's trial. 3. Personnel of the Department of Justice, subject to specific limitations imposed by law or court rule or order, may make public the following informa- tion: (A) The defendant's name, age, residence, employment, marital status, and similar background information. (B) The substance or text of the charge, such as a complaint, indictment, or information. (C) The identity of the investigating and arresting agency and the length of the investigation. (D) The circumstances immediately surrounding an arrest, in- cluding the time and place of arrest, resistance, pursuit, possession and use of weapons, and a description of items seized at the time of arrest. Disclosures should include only incontrovertible, factual matters, and should not include subjective observations. In addition, where background in- formation relating to the circumstances of an arrest would be highly prejudicial and where the release thereof would serve no law enforcement function, such information should not be made public. 4. Personnel of the Department shall not volunteer for publication any information concerning a defendant's prior criminal record. However, this is not intended to alter the Department's present policy that, since federal crimi- nal conviction records are matters of public record permanently maintained in the Department, this information may be made available upon specific inquiry. 5. Because of the particular danger of prejudice resulting from statements in the period approaching and during trial, they ought strenuously to be avoided during that period. Any such statement or release shall be made only on the infrequent occasion when circumstances absolutely demand a disclosure of in- formation and shall include only information which is clearly not prejudicial. 6. The release of certain types of information generally tends to create dangers of prejudice without serving a significant law enforcement function. Therefore, personnel of the Department should refrain from making available the following: (A) Observations about a defendant's character. (B) Statements, admissions, confessions, or alibis attributable to a defendant. (C) References to investigative procedures, such as finger- prints, polygraph examinations, ballistic tests, or laboratory tests. (D) Statements concerning the identity, credibility, or testi- mony of prospective witnesses. (E) Statements concerning evidence or argument in the case, whether or not it is anticipated that such evidence or argument will be used at trial. 7. Personnel of the Department of Justice should take no action to en- courage or assist news media in photographing or televising a defendant or accused person being held or transported in federal custody. Departmental re-</page><page sequence="27">60 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 66:34 presentatives should not make available photographs of a defendant unless a law enforcement function is served thereby. 8. This statement of policy is not intended to restrict the release of in- formation concerning a defendant who is a fugitive from justice. 9. Since the purpose of this statement is to set forth generally applicable guidelines, there will, of course, be situations in which it will limit release of information which would not be prejudicial under the particular circum- stances. Tf a representative of the Department believes that in the interest of the fair administration of justice and the law enforcement process information beyond these guidelines should be released in a particular case, he shall request the permission of the Attorney General or tlhe Deputy Attorney General to do so. NICHOLAS DEB. KATZENBACH Attorney General Date: April 16, 1965 APPENDIX C CBS NEWS Office Communication to: CND Organization from: Herbert Mitgang May 24, 1965 These guidelines cover pre-trial and trial procedures, for radio and television coverage, in both criminal and civil cases, by CBS NEWS. They are standards of self-restraint which we are adopting ourselves; we will resist imposition by outsiders of rules concerning what we can and cannot report. As a first premise, CBS NEWS will continue to pursue the news, of all cases of importance, strongly and independently. Having said that, the second basic premise is that we must exercise great care to respect (1) the right of individuals to fair trial, and (2) the right of the state, and society, to obtain valid convictions which are not prejudiced by any conduct of ours. There are two specific areas which can be especially prejudicial to an accused and to the state's opportunity to obtain a valid conviction: confessions and previous records. Unless there are overriding public policy considerations, henceforth we will refrain from reporting such confessions and prior records until they have been admitted in evidence at the trial. However, it will still be possible (if in the judgment of a news director it is necessary to do so) simply to declare that a confession has been reported-but to go no further and give no details. This brings us to the use of language. As reporters to the public we are not supposed to be as judicious as a judge or as cautious as prosecutors or counsel. By not being adjuncts of police or court officials, we have greater freedom to report. We can still dig deeply, and speak openly. But we must realize that a court proceeding puts an extra obligation on us to be judicious in our choice of words-before, during and after a trial. /s/H.M.

Summary of Recommendations Contempt of Court (1) Proceedings in relation to publications in newspapers and journals should be brought only on the instructions or with leave of the Attorney General (para. 55). (2) The question of whether it is contempt for a newspaper to publish a further libel after a writ has been issued or to comment on a libellous publica- tion in another newspaper should be clarified in any future legislation (para. 41). (3) In the light of the proposed prohibition of the publication of con- temporaneous reports of committal proceedings, the rights of newspapers to publish responsible appeals for witnesses to come forward should be clearly established (para. 42). (4) It should not be regarded as contempt to publish the name and photograph of a notorious and dangerous convict on the run, and the crimes he is suspected of having committed (para. 43). (5) Newspapers should regard themselves as free to comment responsi- bly on sentences between a trial and the hearing of an appeal and should do so in appropriate cases (para. 46). (6) Newspapers should accept their responsibility as guardians of the proceedings in the courts and if criticism of judges needs to be made they should be prepared to risk the consequences of making it (para. 50). (7) In the public interest newspapers should devote more continual and serious att*ention to matters concerning the administration of justice and should employ more experienced reporters and editorial staff for this purpose (para. 56).</page></plain_text>
