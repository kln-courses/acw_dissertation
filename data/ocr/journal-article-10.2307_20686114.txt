Mass times acceleration is the formula defining force and is by implication associated with the law of inertia as defined by Newton's third definition. More than merely staking out an epoch in the history of science, Newton's law has inaugurated an epochal history of the natural sciences.' My concern with this topic will be only marginal; my intention here is not to write an essay on the natural sciences, but rather on the history of the category of the aesthetic, or at best the history of knowledge - one that does jus tice to the cryptic relationship between what, since Baumgarten and Kant, has been called the aesthetic and the surplus (or inertia) of what was available in the development of modern natural scientific research. Allow me to make some preliminary observations on this broad field in order to stake out a claim. Qui Parle vol. 12, No. 1 Spring/Summer 2000</page><page sequence="2">128 ANSELM HAVERKAMP I It is no accident that what we call an epoch and memorialize as epochal achievements has much to do with the concept of mass. This is no arbitrary concept of physics coined by some arbitrary author. The date of its conception, 1700, is yet less arbitrary - es pecially insofar as it oversaw the emergence of the aesthetic out of modern physics even more plainly that the nineteenth and twen tieth centuries believed themselves to have done. That the aesthetic can appear as compensation for the consequences of progress is not due to the fact that it provided the opposite side of this progress with supplementary concepts. It is due rather to the fact that the aesthetic came about as an implication of the theoretical standards of scientific progress and as such, in its concealment, proved resis tant to the historiography of science. The significance of the concept of mass, and the principle of inertia that defines it, do not exhaust themselves in the history of physics. Their place in the canon of scientific education and physi cal theory-formation, which extends well beyond the purview of their merely theoretical value, attests to this. The exemplary role that the law of "force equals mass times acceleration" has attained within the context of education in physics attests to this fact also, as do the radically reductive reconstructions to which Ernst Mach sub ordinated such "metaphysically" burdened concepts as mass and force, or - alternately - the more conciliatory disarming of the same concepts in "protophysics." Max Jammer's conclusion at the end of his comprehensive monograph on the concept of mass "that in spite of concerted efforts by physicists, mathematicians and logi cians until now no definitive clarification of the concept of mass could be achieved," remains the motto and epigraph of all subse quent studies.2 In short, there is a historical surplus of the physical concept of mass that I would like to investigate here, not because of its general suggestiveness for the age of large social mass-movements, but rather on the basis of its historical, conceptual and technical symptomatics for the emergence of what should provide irresistible momentum within the newly discovered aesthetica. The immediacy of this ef</page><page sequence="3">MASS TIMES ACCELERATION 129 fect unexpectedly corresponds to the persistent persuasion of the principle of inertia and its equally "natural" maxim hypotheses non fingo. This would be here, in short, nothing other than force as the medium operative within the mediation of immediacy, which has achieved the status of a far-reaching and persistent formula within the principle of inertia. It is my hypothesis here (non fingo) that we are still living in the very assumption of such immediacy. The concept of mass makes visible a medial assumption that entered into the new concept of the aesthetic from the history of physics, and which then entered into a strange proliferation whose inauthentic mode of "being" produces phenomena like that " great appearance" of ebb and flow that Mach used to illustrate Newton's non fingo and to "visualize" it as an "overwhelming impression."3 There is no superfluous sentimentality on the part of Mach, although one can discern how the nature of the tides truly spills over into history. Rather there is a consequent historical correspondence to what Mach attempts to clarify in the concept of mass and the "un clear" (he also occasionally says "unfortunate") formulation of the principle of inertia. Mach's effort to clarify this principle drives it from the Newtonian paradigm into the new Einsteinian one. Indeed, Einstein explicitly thanked him for this. While Mach unsuccessfully endeavored to rid science of the "metaphysical" residue of the concepts of force and mass, from whose historical attraction he obviously could not extricate him self, Thomas Kuhn had it easier. The precursor role that Einstein at tributed to Mach returns, after and according to Einstein, to the relativity of the precursor paradigm of Newton, which Kuhn - on the analogy of Einstein's general relativity theory - brings to the incommensurable "priority of paradigms" as relativity qua theory. Max Jammer, whose influence Kuhn hesitates to admit, had his book Concepts of Space countersigned by a singularly ambivalent Einstein who refers to the work of his precursors as "noteworthy detours." As he remarks with his own characteristic accuracy, it was "only after the fact" and with great effort "possible to overcome the concept of autonomous and absolute space, which was indispensable for the theoretical development," - "a process" Einstein adds (Princeton, 1 953), "which is probably in no way finished."4</page><page sequence="4">130 ANSELM HAVERKAMP Kuhn therefore underestimates - and in so doing forgets Mach - the detour: the surplus and metaphorical value of all "practi cally" unfruitful (and for scientific praxis fruitless), "purely" theo retical speculations, which Einstein acknowledges as indespensable, if also circuitous and lengthy.5 Mach had very carefully attempted to clarify such speculations. Jammer on the other hand had fore gone such clarification in his attempt to survey unknown terrain, to reconstruct historically unpreconceived and thus largely undecid able sets of presuppositions whose reach and latency remain debat able longer than one would think. Not even for Einstein has this process been concluded. In other words, the mortgage of the pre cursor paradigm is for no successor paradigm completely paid off.6 Jammer's trilogy, Concepts of Space (1954), Concepts of Force (1957), and Concepts of Mass (1960), deepen the problem in a manner which conventional research, jarred by the neopragmatic theory of scientific revolutions, does not grasp and which disquali fies the legendary model of the shift from mythos to logos: the meta phorical preconception or poetic prefiguration of what is later achieved. Thus what I am least able to work out here is that it is not the mythic concept of space that allows for the deepening of the problem. It is rather the concept of mass that lends to the concept of space, "which today possesses a mathematical structure" (not to suggest that it is this structure), an "independent ontological exist ence" as an "inertial system."7 It is therefore not the abundantly appreciated opening up of possible new worlds that could have found in Newton's concept of nature the decisive incentive for a new aesthetic, but the independence of a transcendentally neces sary "reference." In plain English (for those who prefer it), it is the predicate of a contingent, but absolute "reality" - a reality all the more absolute for having emerged out of contingency.8 In what follows, it is impossible to do justice to the carefully reconstructed beau desordre in Jammer's presentation, since I am concerned with only one single point regarding the concept of mass, about whose tangled, contradictory and paradoxical situation one should, however, have no illusions. This point is not to be isolated simply because of misleading implications and associations but rather - and far worse - because of consequences that are anything but</page><page sequence="5">MASS TIMES ACCELERATION 131 misleading. A single intervention into a context as intricate as that of force, mass, space and movement creates secondary problems, which I would gladly spare myself if I could. The subject would be futile in fact if it were not for the mediating layer of rhetorical terms whose trivial (and in the trivium transmitted) standard informed Newton's Principia as well as Baumgarten's Aesthetica and which was finally erased only in Kant's transcendental philosophy. This erasure keeps the aesthetic where it has been ever since: in the implication of Kant's transcendental appropriation of Newton's natural philosophy. This implication and its techniques remain to be discovered. Here, how ever, I can do no more than hint at the terminological mediation between natural philosophy and aesthetics. II Materiae vis insita est potentia resistendi. Thus reads the pas sage from Newton's third definition to which I limit myself here: the force of resistance which as inertia, vis inertiae, represents an acute paradox comparable to the explosive metaphorics of Nicolas of Cusa's infinite circle. It asserts a force interior to matter, which first appears and is released by an appropriate exertion of force from without, which shows itself as the structural equal of the object of force, and which inscribes within the absolute space of forces a concealed fixed point (or perhaps not even that): a hardly determin able point, as volatile as it is variable, which can only be discov ered through repeated measurement and comparison. This is no longer a theodicy, but marks the place of a theodicy without vacat ing the position. One could take this to mean that mass, in the con tingency of its fixation, asserts not so much the position as the trace of withdrawal, which betrays the place of former epiphanies. Leibniz very cleverly led this rearguard skirmish of revelation to success, even if it was at first only the success of reclaiming a lost concept: "In Theologia revelata I undertake to demonstrate, not veritatem of course but rather possibilitatem mysteriorum [...] namely [I abbreviate here; Leibniz speaks here of the condition of possibility of the trinity, incarnation and eucharist]: ut datur in omni corpore principium intimum incorporeum substantiale a mole distinctum, et</page><page sequence="6">132 ANSELM HAVERKAMP hoc illud esse quod veteres, quod Scholastici substantiam dixerint."9 In short, Leibniz speaks of "what the classical sources and later the scholastics called substance." The power of resistance, which Newton's third definition refers to as a force residing within matter, vis insita (from which it is unclear whether it is possibly more originary than all other outside forces which have an effect on it, making it appear thereby as resistance) appears in Leibniz as the source of force sui generis and exposes force thereby as "medium and distributor of ac tivity and energy." So, at any rate, does Jammer recount Leibniz's clever adoption of the old concept of substance. For the scholastics, the concept of mass had already helped to clarify the miracle of trans-substantiation in the relationship between substance and accidents. It had thus paid tribute to its etymology, which both in Greek and in Hebrew signified coarse or unleavened bread. This composite formation (Gemengelage) of the concept of mass made it possible to comprehend the material of bread and wine as the merely accidental and historically-literally contingent, a material whose foundational status is constituted by precisely sen sible contingency. Its contingent materiality enables it to conceive of a vis formativa beyond its immediate context, one which pro duces a duplex quantitas: the determinate dimension of sensory extension (actual spatial content) on the one hand, and the indeter minate dimension of quantitas materiae, which as mass is held to be the basis of spatial extension on the other (including weight).10 It is the assumption of the indeterminate quantitas materiae anchored in this duplicity that contradicts Descartes' res extensa, yet continues to correspond to Newton's absolute space. The res extensa, next to which there can be no empty space because un extended space is unthinkable, is to find an analog only much later in the "hydrodynamics of an incompressible medium."" Between the two extremes of Descartes and Newton is an area of interest for the connection between mass and medium. Most interesting for the discussion of medium, which was enabled by the concept of mass, is how Newton's proportionality of mass and weight is modeled upon the relationship between forma and materia prior to Kepler. Kepler's forma was still entirely vis formativa, performative force, vis-ai-vis a mass that was entirely materia (and that seems to have</page><page sequence="7">MASS TIMES ACCELERATION 133 been the state of things until Descartes' differentiation).12 The dupli cation in which mass and weight diverge and measurably differ has as its source a completely different kind of force than the Platonic forma; it is a vis insita which functions only as vis inertiae (resis tance) in contingent effects - without formative determination or divine inspiration. Kant will resolve the contradiction of the double role of mass (as a medium of a force implanted within it but distinct from it - a force which can be distinguished from mass but not separated from it) in a manner he refers to, in a historically pointed phrase, as "Co pernican." In a footnote to the introduction of the Critique of Pure Reason, he exemplifies his own Copernican turn in terms of Newton's principle of inertia, a passage described eloquently in Hans Blumen berg's treatment not of the topic but of Kant's self-understanding of his role for the modern tradition.13 In his Metaphysical Foundations of the Natural Sciences, Kant qualified Newton's mass as something ir reducibly, quasi-transcendentally "real," which as matter, "thanks to kinetic forces, fills out space."14 Kant conceives of the difference be tween space and matter as the a priori of a discrete, yet continuous matter-structure, whose a priori conceivability Newton had "proved." According to Kant, Newton completed the Copernican turn and dis closed thereby "the invisible force that holds the structure of the uni verse together (Newtonian attraction)" - a force moreover, Kant continues, "which would have remained forever undiscovered, if Copernicus had not dared, by a method, which, though contradict ing the senses, was yet true, to look for the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies but in the spectator."" What would have remained hidden and continued to function is the hyper-reflexive reality of a context of forces which sticks, so-to speak, to matter; Mach uses the term "adheres," but even this is tell ing, for it is derived from the manner in which the described subject mailer is given. Mach's own "principle of reaction" (Gegenwirkung) had reduced the subject mailer empirically; Einstein made it and the "Machian principle" objectless, as the last expression of the Newtonian paradigm. What this means, metaphorologically speaking, is that the terminological fixation or "terminologization" (in Blumenberg's sense) of the Newtonian paradigm finds itself, after its suspension by Einstein,</page><page sequence="8">134 ANSELM HAVERKAMP reduced to the status of a bygone metaphoricity that was about to become fluid again. And the concept of mass itself becomes visible and palpable as the concept of transcription, according to which the "detour" - by which absolute space can be overcome according to Einstein - becomes calculable. Very early on and (like Jammer) with sphinx-like consent from Einstein, Ernst Cassirer had represented the theory of relativity as a generalization of Kant's a priori appropriation of Newton, including the latter's concept of matter. He worked out thereby the function of absolute space in terms of what Blumenberg would call an "abso lute metaphor."16 As Cassirer remarks in his study of Einstein's theory of relativity (which may have motivated Blumenberg's concept), it is "in itself nothing and not an object"; it signifies "only any other relative space" that we can conceive; in Kant's own words "as an idea, which should serve as a rule, to observe all movement in it as merely relative."17 As Stephen Toulmin reminds us,,Newton rhetorically modelled the distinction between absolute and relative space after the distinc tion between the mathematic and the sensory and introduced within this distinction the concept of inert mass as sensorially or perceptu ally relative appearance.18 This was an eminently rhetorical opera tion, as Newton himself emphasized, on an eminently rhetorical foundation, which is generally criticized away as a so-called Neoplatonic residue, yet which is obviously calculated by Newton to a mathematicizing end. Mass, in these calculations, is converted into points of mass; it appears to shrink to little more than an idealization of calculability in geometric points, onto which bodies are postu lated. This mathematicizing shows the double, rhetorical face of mass: it renders nonsensory what the phenomenon of absolute space had made palpable in the first place, which is to say calculable. To this extent, Newton's absolute space participates in the "al legory of persuasion," which Paul de Man identified in Pascal's ge ometry and classified in the appropriate tropological terminology as "synechdochal totalization of infinitude.""9 It is the reverse side of the findings that Blumenberg describes as a "terminologization of probability," a process by which probability becomes termino logically fixed: the effect of mathematicization, which terminologi</page><page sequence="9">MASS TIMES ACCELERATION 135 cally literalizes what, as metaphorical, is only probable (wahr scheinlich) in that it renders the appearance of truth (den An-schein von Wahrheit) visible.20 However, this is only a renewed (the new est) appearance of the literal which the terminologization produces. Newton's concept of mass becomes the metaleptic place-holder for the "reference" in the tota allegoria established within mathemati cally absolute space - a reference that functions as the material presupposition for the points of mass and their apparent idealiza tion (to this extent they are pseudoplatonic). Blumenberg's metaphorological example of such idealizations and their rhetori cal function is the "intellectual sphere," a "misunderstanding origi nating with Plotinus, which reduced the metaphorical function of the spherical shape to its symbolic function." Blumenberg's metaphorological findings are sufficient for present purposes, insofar as the absolute metaphor derived from Newton's absolute space is sufficient to constitute the tota allegoria (as opposed to the allegoria permixta). As such, it is no theological residue, but the rhetorical substructure of a theologically successful tropology, which is applied mathematically by Newton and Leibniz; Blumenberg calls it "meta-kinetic" instead of meta-physical.22 That is, the new tropology is no longer (only) topos- or space-related in its presupposition of kinesis- it resides beyond (and in Blumenberg's reading of Kant, that means "transcendental" to) the concept of any (possible) movement. In brief, the modern rhetoric that operates within the aesthetic as its modus operandi is no longer ontologically fixed, but relational; and the aesthetic is no longer modelled mi metically, but-"medially." What this means remains to be shown. Interestingly, it was none other than Mach, who - in his com mentary on Corollarium V of the Principia, which kept his attention to the very end of his career - drew the most important conclusion from this problem, an unexpectedly metaphorological conclusion of the Kantian manner, the extent of whose implications he must have never realized. Newton's fifth corollary deals with how bodies enclosed within a space relate to each other in the same way, inde pendent of whether this space rests, moves or how it moves - it is thus already a kind of theory of relativity. "It would be possible," Mach comments, "that the isolated bodies A, B, C ..., upon deter</page><page sequence="10">136 ANSELM HAVERKAMP mining the movement of body K, play only an arbitrary role [which justifies my failure to explain the role of the experimentally sum moned bodies A, B, C ..., to the extent that their function is clear in the following], that the movement [of body K] be determined by the medium in which K resides. One would then have to posit that medium in the place of Newton's absolute space." 23 But "this idea is decidedly not one that Newton had," Mach emphasizes. Newton did not have it, as little as Copernicus had Newton's idea. Not until Kant could Newton's point be inscribed into Copernicus - it would otherwise have "remained forever undiscovered," says Kant. Mach performed this service for Newton; it is Kant's point that he could not escape from inflicting on Newton. He too gets further thereby than his predecessor by rehabilitating Newton's absolute space belatedly as a "hypothetical medium" and by positing it, in its status as medium, as equal in priority to inertia: "as the first fact," which makes inertia possible, insofar as it gives inertia space in which the force within mass (free of all theomorphic and anthropomorphic as sociation - from the unmoved mover to the engineer) can play out the complementarity of both force and mass as a meta-morphosis of the classical complementarity between forma and materia. It is an aristotelianism, so it seems, which - in the manner of Derrida's reconstructed mythologie blanche - inscribes within the platonism of forms a phenomenology of the real world as a supple mentary point (whereby both "aristotelianism" and "platonism" are to be read in historically relativizing quotation marks).24 As a mere "interpretive means toward the possible unity of physical knowl edge," to which Kant reduces the concept of force in the passage on the "invisible force which holds the universe together," the naked name of force (abandoned by all agents and good spirits) has need of the material reference, mass, as whose placeholder or placehold ing trigger it appears.25 As the science of movement, mechanics can spare itself this name, and it does so with increasing success in Kirchhoff, Hertz, and Mach until it is reduced to nothing but an empty scheme, "a pure relational or mathematical function," whose other attests to its effectiveness.26 As an empty scheme, as a mere name of the relation defined in the phrase "mass times accelera tion," force is the metaphor of the trans-actions described in me</page><page sequence="11">MASS TIMES ACCELERATION 137 chanical terms; in that it exhausts itself in these, it "is" their mode of being. From out of the void of the metaphorical scheme, it be comes the epitome of the background fulfillment called "mediality." The space that with Newton becomes "the medium of the unity of the universe" exposes its mediality first and completely in the relationality of force which operates universally in space.27 Being "purely relational," this universality is figural, and what it shows - as Bertrand Russell clearly saw - is the figural profile of metalepsis. It is the prototype of all modern metalepses of cause and effect, for it betrays the primal scene of what we have learned to expect from Nietzsche's intuition. As Russell describes the result of the inver sion: "Hence a force [as postulated cause of every acceleration], if it be a cause, is the cause of an effect which never takes place."28 This insight corresponds to a programmatic and internal shift of metaphoric from force to energy, from mass to wave, in the self description of mechanics since Hertz: a "new picture of the elemen tary processes of movement" suggests Hertz, who refers to the result by the rhetorical name of the mediality productive in energy: enargeia, the mediality of pictures.29 III The concept of hyper-reflection, which I used in passing above, appears in the late work of Merleau-Ponty and is used methodologi cally by Lyotard and Gasche; Monika Langer translates the term into the definitive formula of "perception as perceived perceiving."30 She translates into a phenomenological paradox what Kant refers to in his footnote to Copernicus and Newton as "a method which, though contradicting the senses, was yet true." The meta-physical antithesis of formative force and formed matter in the concept of mass (in this measurable vis inertiae that dwells within matter), which Kant's meta physics of nature was able to overcome by an inversion of the pre suppositions guiding his inquiry, is an historically decisive, even paradigmatic example. Taking together Newton, Kant and the rumi nations of Mach cited above, all reflection on mediality and its quasi transcendental status for what Kant calls the "real" of matter could be called hyper-reflexive. In such a case, one would also have to con</page><page sequence="12">138 ANSELM HAVERKAMP sider the priority of self-perception in the work of Merleau-Ponty as a phenomenological paradigm of the dependence of all hyper-reflexiv ity on self-perception qua re-presentation as a medium of reflection.31 McLuhan's slogan in Understanding Media of the medium that is the message - I omit Merleau - owes its success to the manner in which he turns this fact into a petitio principii, which from the summit of achieved progress telescopically collapses the salvational rhetoric of the MIT Media Lab.32 I. A. Richards' distinction between tenor and vehicle as the two fundamental components of metaphor, which had already been generalized by a more cunning theoreti cian of media, Jacques Lacan, led to the discovery of a tendency in the medial interaction of these components which comes to fruition particularly in poetic condensation: in which the tenor itself be comes the vehicle of thematizing the mediality of the vehicle and this moment of becoming-reflexive of the vehicularity of metaphor is played out and represented in poetry.33 McLuhan, who occasionally mentions the analogy between medium and metaphor, exploits the result not, however, without gesturing toward the proof of a teleology in which the vestiges of metaphysics are unintentionally reinstated once more behind the back of mechanical research which had refuted and overcome them. One could say that McLuhan after the fact reinscribes the metalepsis of causality discovered by Russell within the model of energy privi leged by Hertz. This model is no other than that of the neoplatonic metaphysics of light whose metaphorological foundation had al ready been exposed by no one less than Augustine.34 It is in fact light and nothing else which is intended to prove the maxim of the medium as message. When McLuhan says that "The instance of the electric light may prove illuminating," what he really means is that Hertz's metaphor-shift had helped to verify neoplatonism and - an irony in the history of media - literally proved it. "This fact, char acteristic of all media, means that the 'content' of any medium is always another medium."35 They would all be aufgehoben in this epoch - the pseudomorphosis of neo- or pseudoplatonisms. With a single mytheme, McLuhan wipes the entire modern history of science from the field. He is able to do this because he knows to totalize in the phenomenon of hyper-reflection the rhe</page><page sequence="13">MASS TIMES ACCELERATION 139 torical epoch which helped produce this history. He does this, how ever, not under the conditions of the new media qua new "pictoriality" (in Hertz's sense) - these must still be investigated - but rather under those of the "gestalt-switch" phenomenon, oscil lating between metaphor and picture, language and perception, fixed and canonized within the medium of texts. These are still to be in terrogated, as I said, and I would like to contribute to this effort. In light of the situation as it has been described, the persisting detach ment of media-ideological myth formation, rhetorico-technical analysis, technological constraints and lifeworld burdens, it is inter esting that the aesthetic interpretation lags behind historically no less than the media-theoretical one; for the two are related. IV It could be easily argued that I use "mediality" like one of Blumenberg's reality concepts, the last one in the historical series of reality concepts, the "experience of resistance." In fact Blumenberg elaborates and measures this concept in relation to the concept of inert mass. Yet he wants to ensure that his precious experience of re sistance - "as that which cannot be mastered by the subject and which offers it resistance" - is not understood as a mere "experience of contact, of inert mass."36 For Blumenberg, inert mass as such is prior to the concept of experience as an an-aesthetic sphere of mere contact. Blumenberg situates the "possibility of the novel," which is his interest here, in the preceding reality concept of coherence. As the borderline value of this reality concept, inert mass can approach the reality of resistance only from without as a mere quality of contact. What I am calling here mediality becomes thinkable as a back ground or underground, which precedes or provides the foundation for concepts of reality and which has become thematizable in the historical transition between them - without having been able to achieve the status of more than a quasi-transcendental Ding an sich, inert mass, in the expression of the new concept. Inert mass with draws from the concept as something co-conceptualized rather than resisting the act of conceiving as such. It motivates only the meta phor of conception as the palpable quality of contact of the real.</page><page sequence="14">140 ANSELM HAVERKAMP Corresponding to this is the reductive point of the Newtonian con cept of nature. As Blumenberg suggests, "only the inertial quality of a body has remained in the strictest sense 'natural,' as a form of movement therefore the unacceleratedly consistent, regular trajec tory in absolute space."37 The result of this is that every deviation of reality from the platonic ideality of the trajectory of movement is to be perceived as "violent" - by virtue of the metaphor of vis. One sees immediately how (and why) the inertia of mass with draws from the concept of reality in order to motivate the experi ence of resistance in its withdrawal. Blumenberg's analysis duplicates here Heidegger's critique of Dilthey in Being and Time, pursuing it far beyond the ontological argument of "world disclosure."38 It would not be the binding of matter (presupposed by Newton) to the order of coherence inscribed within it that would transform inert matter into the borderline value of the reality concept of coherence, but rather the influence of force degrading matter to mass which, as resistance, would come to fruition - aesthetically- in the experi ence of the later reality concept. In Blumenberg's attribution of the postulate of coherence to the emergence of the (modern) novel as well as to the transcendental expression of (an equally modern) phenomenology, the novel and phenomenology are revealed as a historical tandem of theologically pre-aesthetic standards with post aesthetic explications (or realizations, as one might say phenom enologically). Such is the historical assessment of the aesthetic whose "state of the art" is still represented by Blumenberg. This is the un challenged German version of an aesthetics inaugurated by Cassirer and Ritter, commentated by Adorno and propagated in versions, reductions and epiphanies by Marquard, Iser, Jaug and Kittler.39 In this conception of German aesthetics, the aesthetic age re mains itself excluded or bracketed from the sequence of reality con cepts - as if it resided beyond all concepts of reality (definitively beyond, meta-, the aristotelian-metaphorological sense of kinesis). It remains excluded or bracketed by Blumenberg himself in a sug gestion of late theological, life-philosophical paradoxies - the para doxical outstrippings of a literary age escaping from theology, which would escape the reality concepts in the concept of escape, yet in its escape from the concepts cannot escape the past, its own past."0</page><page sequence="15">MASS TIMES ACCELERATION 141 It would be a literary age that would not be Hegelian in the sense of representing a past age capable of sublation, but rather an age end lessly oscillating in hyper-reflection, epochally oscillating with us spectators enclosed within - yet still a past age that would oscil late aesthetically with us. The bracketing of the aesthetic along with the detour taken by nineteenth-century progress - the detour of progress whose aesthetic implication oscillates with us in the mediality of media - awaits explication. Blumenberg leaves us in the lurch two hundred years too early. In the vanishing point of our abandonment, however, he indicates the proliferating miscalcula tion of aesthetic speculations dating from this time. Media are per haps and for the moment nothing other (nothing more and nothing less) than the hyper-reflexive condensation of this implication as which the aesthetic, in any case this aesthetic, emerges.
