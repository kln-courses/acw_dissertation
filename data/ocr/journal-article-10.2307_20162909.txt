<plain_text><page sequence="1">GUTHRIE ON THE EARLIER PRESOCRATICS1 Thomas Gould in the preface to the fourth edition of his Fragmente der Vorsokratiker Diels suggested that perhaps he should have printed the evidence for pre-philosophic writings on the formation of the world, its organization, the gods, and the right conduct of human life before he presented the evidence for the beliefs of Tha?es and the rest (instead of tucking it into an appendix). In the next edition, Kranz carried out Diels' suggestion; and some subsequent writers on ancient philosophy, Kirk and Raven, for instance, have followed that procedure. W. K. C. Guthrie, how ever, in the first volume (the only one to appear so far) of his new History of Greek Philosophy, goes back to the older habit of beginning immediately with the Ionian physicists. But the result of Guthrie's procedure is not, as one might have expected, to obscure the continuity between philosophy and earlier non-philosophic thought in Greece; just the reverse. It turns out that by dealing with the earlier thinkers first, Kirk and the rest got them out of the way, as it were; they acknowledged a continuity without having to deal with it constantly. Guthrie, on the other hand, forces himself to bring in the evidence for wide spread, non-systematic, and often unconscious beliefs again and again, and to place this evidence side by side with the remains of the writings of rational thinkers. As a consequence, Guthrie's History is also an excellent study?even better than his mentor Cornford's various investigations, From Religion to Philosophy, Principium Sapientiae, etc.?of the characteristics that distinguish philosophers and rational thinkers from other men who attempt to speak of some of the same matters as those treated by philosophers. As Guthrie said in his introductory "memoir" in Cornford's The Unwritten Philosophy (Cambridge, 1950), p. viii, Cornford in a sense wrote the same book over and over again?and was quite aware in his last years that he was doing so. The basic thought was put this way in Cornford's inaugural lecture, The Laws of Motion in Ancient Thought (Cambridge, 1931): If we look beneath the surface of philosophical discussion, we find that its course is largely governed by assumptions that are seldom, or never mentioned. I mean that ground work of current conceptions shared by all the men of a given culture and never mentioned because it is taken for granted as obvious. 1 History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. I, by W. K. C. Guthrie. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 539 pp. $10.00.</page><page sequence="2">144 guthrie on the earlier presocratics Guthrie has followed out the implications of this idea, and with industry and intelligence (not just pietas) has made it a central concern in almost all of his writings. In his first book, Orpheus and Greek Religion (London, 1935) he said, for instance (p. 222): The intention in thus stating the chief points of Anaxi mander's cosmogony has been to lead up to the view (nota bly presented by Professor Cornford) that in spite of their efforts to put forward a purely scientific scheme, the specu lations of the Ionians were unconsciously conditioned and moulded by the pre-existing mythological solutions of the same problem. The idea was pursued through The Greeks and Their Gods, In the Beginning (especially the first two chapters), and most ex plicitly in "The Presocratic World-Picture" (Harvard Theological Review 1952, 87-104). But Guthrie's History of Greek Philos ophy, to judge from the first volume (which includes the Mi lesians, the Pythagoreans, Alcmaeon, Xenophanes, and Hera clitus), will be the culmination of his effort and the proof of the soundness of his basic assumption. The "unconscious presuppositions" varied some, of course, but not much. The "general world picture" that was shared by most, or at least a surprising number of the sixth and fifth century Greeks, had the following characteristics, according to Guthrie. ( See, for example, p. 480. ) The spherical kosmos is surrounded by a fiery stuff which is good, divine, ever-living, conscious, and in control of all orderly phenomena within the world. Human beings, and perhaps other things as well, have psyches or daimones, which are bits or sparks of this outer stuff, temporarily cut off and watered down or defiled. These sparks may rejoin the fiery region again after death, however, and in fact can only be entirely happy if they do. In its unified and divine form this stuff is sometimes called breath, sometimes aither, and is often identi fied with the stars; in its inferior form in the sublunary world its name is more likely to be psyche or aer. The kosmos itself is a great, blessed being which sustains its life by breathing in the pure periechon from without. The world is beautiful?a kosmos? because the opposites, hot and cold, wet and dry, which have been somehow "separated out" of the originally unified divine first-principle (arche), are not allowed to encroach unjustly on one another and so display order and proportion: harmon?a. Human beings, like all things subject to the cycles of winter and summer, are condemned to repeated reincarnations after every return to the One?unless they purify themselves. If we know how to do that, we can be reunited permanently with nature. A most important part of this "purification" is a correct intellectual grasp of the truth about the world and its order.</page><page sequence="3">Thomas Gould 145 In a way, however, this is not really a pre-philosophical or non philosophical view at all; it is the heart and soul of the philo sophical program in what Plato called the "ancient quarrel be tween poetry and philosophy": the enemy were Homer and Hesiod and all who explained human and natural phenomena by the passions of individual anthropomorphic deities, gods who often acted, according to the poets, like selfish and irrational human beings. Xenophanes and Heraclitus in particular were vividly aware that the truth as they saw it could only be grasped if people repudiated the Iliad and the Theogony. Guthrie tries to relate each philosophical system in turn to this central vision. His first reward is to be able to offer an explanation as to why certain Milesian thinkers should suddenly have begun to describe a single self-moving, self-organizing first principle behind phenomena. He is also able to defend Aristotle's con jectures as to why Tha?es chose water as his arche, and to say many suggestive things about Anaximander's choice of apeiron, Anaximenes' of aer, and Heraclitus' conception of the logos-Ore. But by far the most sensational effect of Guthrie's procedure is to reinstate Xenophanes and the Pythagoreans as true and interest ing philosophers. Aristotle and modern readers alike have not infrequently been so annoyed by the fuzziness and religiosity of these thinkers that they have been tempted to exclude them from the study of philosophy altogether. Yet, when these men are put into the context of the general anti-Homeric, anti-Hesiodic world picture (which Guthrie sees in such non-philosophers as Pindar, Aeschylus and Euripides, also in many mystery religions and in some of the beliefs ridiculed by Aristophanes), they turn out to be very important indeed in the succession of the "rational" thinkers. They were loyal members of the philosophical camp in the great quarrel, and each made extremely sophisticated sug gestions which proved to be genuine advances. The most novel and exciting part of this volume, and perhaps the most valuable single study that Guthrie has ever made, is his full account (almost two hundred pages long) of the Pythag oreans . In the preface to Orpheus and Greek Religion Guthrie had spoken of "the professional scholars who have more than once been given excellent grounds for believing Orphism to be nothing more than a field of rash speculation on insufficient evi dence," and who will therefore "probably regard a book on Orphism with suspicion." He could certainly have said something at least as strong about the attitude of many a professional scholar today (especially in Great Britain and America) toward the ex istence of Pythagoraen philosophy in the Presocratic period. Erich Frank's Plato und die sogenannten Pythagoreer (Halle, 1923), which threw doubt on the possibility that any of our really il luminating evidence about philosophical and systematic Pythag oreanism referred to pre-Platonic thought at all, was, for all of its</page><page sequence="4">146 guthrie on the earlier presocratics slippery reasoning, widely accepted with gratitude, for it seemed to relieve us from the duty of sifting hideously complex argu ments and evidence. At the same time, those of us who admire Plato were only too glad not to have to take seriously the (fairly numerous) signs that our hero owed a very large debt indeed to these earlier men. And finally, the trustworthiness of Aristotle as a witness and interpreter of any of the Presocratics?and Aris totle is by far the best single source for our knowledge of the Pythagoreans?was questioned by Cherniss in a very impressive study, Aristotle's Criticism of Presocratic Philosophy (Baltimore 1935). Later even the doxographic tradition was attacked?at its most vital point, the intelligence of Theophrastus?by McDiarmid, in "Theophrastus on the Presocratic Courses" (Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, 1953, 1-156). And so it is not surprising that Guthrie's leisurely, learned and closely reasoned attack on our skepticism concerning pre-Platonic Pythagorean philosophy is the most controversial and newsworthy feature of this first volume. And Guthrie is successful, I think. He has brought us back to our senses. We must not dismiss the Pythagoreans as being out side philosophy, nor have we really good reasons for doubting that we know what their ideas were as far back as the fifth century. Guthrie profits from Cherniss' skeptical study but does not agree with his conclusions. First he shows that Aristotle's knowledge of some early Pythagorean writings must have been first hand, then he argues that Aristotle was in a position to dis tinguish between those Pythagoreans who came before Plato and those whose thought was influenced by Platonism, and then he shows that Aristotle did not distort the Pythagoreans hopelessly. That is, Cherniss had shown how consistently Aristotle demanded of his predecessors that they should have made Aristotelian distinctions?among the four kinds of causes, for instance?but Guthrie proves that nevertheless we often have all the informa tion we need to judge just how much and in what way Aristotle's characteristic habits of thought have affected his reports of his predecessors' statements. Aristotle was clearly irritated by the Pythagoreans, and even disgusted with them at times. But he did not distort them deliberately, nor was he entirely wanting in his torical sense. He thought that the Pythagoreans were important enough to study, and he occasionally said perceptive things about them. Guthrie shows admirable "negative capability" in his recon struction of Pythagorean philosophy. Again and again he con cludes that there is no way of knowing just how early or how late a given idea is, whether it is an invention of Philolaus or older than him or discovered at the Academy, whether all Pythagoreans held it or only some, and so on. But he does not let these un certainties bog him down. He goes right on, calmly delineating</page><page sequence="5">Thomas Gould 147 the main idea: it is once more the "philosophical" world picture common in the sixth and fifth centuries, described this time, how ever, in terms of number, void, limit and the unlimited, with new emphasis on salvation through bodily purification (as well as intellectual), and with a new dualism between good and evil imported, perhaps, from the East. As one would expect, Guthrie's reconstruction of Pythagorean ism is not radically different from those of his fellow Canta brigians, Cornford and Raven. He owes much, too, to the writings of Cameron, Delatte, Minar, Rostagni and others. (He is always generous and careful in allotting credit for an insight or a correct inference. ) But Guthrie's account is more vivid and more believ able than any other, for the two reasons I have mentioned: first, because of his massive and painstakingly reasoned attacks on current skepticism concerning the evidence, and secondly, be cause of the ease with which he is able, by means of his recon struction of the "general world picture," to fit Pythagorean ideas into their proper place in the history of philosophy. One of the startling results of Guthrie's procedure is to allow him, or rather to force him, to use works like the Timaeus, Epinomis, and even De C?elo, to fill in what a mid-fifth century Pythagorean must have said or meant. This is startling, as I say, but convincing nevertheless. Surely no writer on Plato will ever again be able to ignore the Pythagoreans or pass lightly over the question of Plato's debt to them. And for this reason Guthrie's volumes on Plato and Aristotle will undoubtedly be extremely interesting to students of Plato. Xenophanes, in Guthrie's treatment, turns out to have been a rather marvelous old man, a poet who really did grow wise with his years and his travels. But he was more than that, Guthrie argues: he was, as Plato saw, a philosopher and the spiritual father of Parmenides and the other Eleatics. What makes Xe nophanes a philosopher? He was a poet-teacher with a message, a message of his own, spoken with authority. But so much could be said for Solon and Theognis. Xenophanes also sometimes chose the nature of the universe and of divinity as his subject. But then, so did Hesiod and Pherecydes, and they are not called philoso phers. The crucial difference, Guthrie suggests (p. 368) is Xe nophanes' loyalty to those who, like the Milesians and Pythag oreans, asserted the unity of reality. He saw very clearly that Homer and Hesiod were his enemies. In fact, he may well have been the first to attack them point-blank and by name (though there is a story that Pythagoras said he saw both poets under going severe punishments when he visited Hades). And the pic ture of the universe that Xenophanes offers is neither a refinement of Homeric or Hesiodic religion nor a sudden insight of his own; it is a subtle and powerful version of the same "Presocratic World Picture" found in the Milesians and the Pythagoreans. Further</page><page sequence="6">148 guthrie on the earlier presocratics more, it is an advance over these, for Xenophanes, as Guthrie points out (p. 402), conceived "a stricter notion of unity which excluded the possibility of a generated cosmos, taught of a single god who worked by intellection alone, and posited an essential connection between divinity, eternity, reality, and spherical shape. For all this the Eleatics, and Heraclitus as well, are much in his debt, as also for the distinction between knowledge and seeming or opinion and the idea that all sensations are relative." There is a minor but annoying problem in interpreting Xe nophanes' monotheism. Despite his powerful arguments against anthropomorphism and the dramatic and emphatic tone in which he announces the truth about the unity and stability of divinity (fr. 23, for instance), Xenophanes then shows no compunction at all about also talking of the traditional gods in the plural (fr. 1, for instance, and fr. 23 itself!) Guthrie quite rightly dismisses attempts to gloss over this inconsistency by calling the references to gods in the plural "polar expressions" and clich?s. But he then does much the same thing by concluding that Xenophanes was just careless, or that he was graciously polite and conventional when he was leading off a symposium instead of explaining his theology (p. 375). Surely one of the most interesting lessons to be learned from Guthrie's exposure of the perennially hardy "World Picture,"?that almost uncontested, almost unconscious vision which remained so constant through the years that Guthrie could range back and forth with great ease from Tha?es to the Timaeus ?is that the Greek philosophers apparently never did see any reason why an identification of to pan (the all) with a single living, all-embracing, all-controlling divinity meant that we would be wrong ever to speak of Zeus, Apollo, Dionysus and the rest. The visions of the Timaeus and the Phaedrus offer good examples. So do the statements by Heraclitus about god and the gods, as Guthrie himself points out (p. 472). Guthrie also quotes Aeschy lus, fr. 70: "Zeus is all things and what is beyond them all." May it not have been the same with Xenophanes? He attacks Homer and Hesiod for attributing unworthy motives to the gods (frr. 11, 12), he attacks ordinary men for their petty and provincial imaginations when they try to picture divinity (frr. 14-16), and he asserts that the whole is one and the one is god and that god is eternal and does not need to wander or to use physical motions to guide phenomena (frr. 23-26 etc.). But Xenophanes' actual words are "God is one, greatest among gods and men, in no way like mortals either in body or in mind" (fr. 23, Guthrie's transla tion) . God (is) one, greatest among gods. Surely we must accept these words literally, just as we do similar expressions in Hera clitus, Aeschylus and Plato. Xenophanes' criticism of Homer exactly parallels Plato's: 1) the traditional gods are moral, not immoral; they are to be admired and emulated, not feared as jealous or hostile to our happiness, and 2) somehow coexisting</page><page sequence="7">Thomas Gould 149 with, embracing, and far superior to these is the all which is one great living being. (Compare Guthrie's description of the simul taneous and overlapping notions of psyche and daimon, pp. 318, f.). Guthrie's reconstruction of the philosophy of Heraclitus is masterful and makes exciting reading, but in the end it is some how disappointing. "I share with others," he says (p. 427) "the impression that many of the fragments fit together in a way one would not at first expect, so that what seem to be isolated and metaphorical utterances are in fact integral parts of a unified con ception of the universe and man's part of it." He then sets out to delineate this "unified conception." Heraclitus defeats him, how ever, at least in part. The trick is to deal fairly and rationally with all the quotations and the second-hand evidence concerning the sayings of this hysterical genius, and yet not kill our excitement about the brilliance and apparent lightness of his essential in sight. That is, shortly after a reader of the fragments begins to try to work out the riddles and to put the pieces together, he gen erally experiences a thrill as of being on the verge of a truly pro found idea. But that thrill is usually very very faint after he has done his best to figure out just what Heraclitus meant. Of course, the initial excitement may be misleading. Kirk would seem to argue so in Heraclitus: the Cosmic Fragments (Cambridge, 1954). But many readers will undoubtedly sympathize with Guthrie's attempt to give Heraclitus credit for real brilliance, and his hope to keep our wonder and admiration alive all through our investigation. In the case of Heraclitus, Guthrie argues, Aristotle was indeed just plain wrong, on very important matters, over and over again. But Plato, he suggests (p. 437) really understood Heraclitus, es pecially at Sophist 242 d, where he apparently quotes Heraclitus as saying "in drawing apart it is always being drawn together." Largely on Plato's authority Guthrie then 1) denies that Hera clitus could have believed in a periodic ecpyrosis (here he is with Kirk), and 2) asserts that Heraclitus did indeed posit a theory of universal flux (here he is against Kirk). The result of these two decisions is to give Heraclitus credit for an extraordinarily com plex and sophisticated theory about the basic law of the universe. Plato and the other ancients were quite right when they said that for Heraclitus change (war, strife, tension) was the universal law, not harmon?a (proportion, static order or arrangement); but so are Reinhardt and Kirk and other modern writers right when they say that it is the law of change, the permanent and there fore knowable order of processes that Heraclitus was seeking to describe. There is a harmon?a, in other words, but the Pythag oreans had got it all wrong: they did not see that the absence of enmity and conflicting pulls would spell the end of order and beauty. Here is how Guthrie sums it up (p. 487) :</page><page sequence="8">150 guthrie on the earlier presocratics The truth that has flashed on him has two sides. First, we conceive of the world of our experience as containing ob jects, possessed of a certain stable and relatively permanent character. This seems to us also a desirable state of affairs, so that we commend as good any apparently harmonious ar rangement which enables its product to stay quietly as it is, and stigmatize disruptive forces as bad. The truth is far otherwise. What we take for stability and rest is the outcome not of any harmonious agreement of parts but of an inces sant struggle of opposing forces which has happened to reach an equilibrium of tension. Exertion, motion, change are constantly though invisibly going on; strife is the con dition of existence: there is no rest, only unremitting change... On the other side, however, this constant warfare is not allowed to go unregulated. If it were, it might some day cease. The cosmos has existed for ever and will go on exist ing, and this could not be guaranteed if there were a possi bility of one of the contraries ever gaining a permanent ad vantage. In fact no contrary can exist if its contrary should disappear. Pre-eminent in the Heraclitean universe stands the Logos, the divine law of measure and proportion. Every thing is always moving up and down the path of change, driven thereto by the attacks of its opposites or its own at tacks upon them, but all within strict limits. The path is a circular one, on which *beginning and end are the same.' But of course there is a third side of Heraclitus' message. Guthrie argues (against Kirk) that Logos is thought as well as the prin ciple discovered by thought. And we can never forget that Hera clitus also calls the Logos fire, air, god, the thunderbolt of Zeus, guide of all and guarantor of justice, the true or eventual nature of everything, divine and infallible intelligence. He attacks Homer and Hesiod (as well as Xenophanes and Pythagoras), pours scorn on the crudeness of most people's understanding of the gods and of religious rites, and makes dark predictions about an afterlife. In other words, Heraclitus, for all his singularities, turns out to be one of the easiest of all the Presocratics to fit into the main tradition. Guthrie is able to make the most bizarre of Heraclitus' utterances sound perfectly natural and indeed inevi table, merely by showing his cosmology to be but another refine ment of the "General World Picture": the kosmos as a great, divine, ever living being, breathing in the fiery intelligence from outside and distributing sparks of it to the beings here below (pp. 470, ff.). Unfortunately, the spelling out of this connection, although it had the effect of elevating the Pythagoreans and Xenophanes to the rank of true rationalists, has the reverse effect on our feelings toward Heraclitus. It is almost as effective in tak</page><page sequence="9">Thomas Gould 151 ing the sting out of his dark utterances as is Kirk's refusal to attribute to him the notion of universal flux. This does not mean that Guthrie is wrong, however. Indeed, he is probably right. Heraclitus belongs to another world; it is not possible for us to be Heracliteans any more. But I would not like to leave the impression that Guthrie's procedure always has this deflating effect. On the contrary, it often allows us to increase our respect for the individual thinkers, rather than the reverse. Guthrie brings out the originality of the Pythagoreans in shifting men's attention from matter to form and in insisting on a basic dualism of good and evil, order and chaos; the originality of Xenophanes in sharpening men's awareness of what is involved in the ideas of unity; and of Heraclitus in bringing their attention to the problem of doing justice to intelligible order and inevitable incessant change, both at the same time. The later volumes of Guthrie's History should therefore be of great interest. In the second volume Guthrie will have to deal with the problem of reconciling (in some sense) the Two Ways of Parmenides and the two bizarrely different poems of Empedocles. Surely his characteristic approach should prove very effective in handling puzzles like these. (See Harvard Theological Review, 1952, pp. 98, ff.). But what are we to make of Guthrie's new definition of the philosophical tradition? Or rather, what can we make of our philosophical tradition if we accept Guthrie's discovery concern ing the form that this tradition took in the beginning? There is no doubt that Guthrie's account of the central vision or myth both illuminates and makes credible Plato's attitude toward his pro fession and his predecessors. It also explains the religious side of Aristotle's metaphysics. Furthermore, a great deal of the central myth is still obviously at the heart of European philosophy in later centuries: a belief in the order and beauty of the whole of nature, trust in a benevolent, intelligent power which is simultaneously above and within phenomena, and the conviction that we harbor a spark of the divine intelligence which ultimately unites us with nature (at least after "death"), and which it is our duty to purify both in the routine of our daily lives and in the clarification of our understanding of how the universe operates. Nor are we without respected clear-headed thinkers even today (indeed I presume Professor Guthrie to be one of them) who feel that somewhere in this central myth there lies an all-important truth?that the defi nition of philosophy which sets Tha?es and his successors apart from their rivals, Homer and the poets, is, if not an entirely ade quate definition of what philosophy is (or should be) today, yet a part of it and an important part. Still, that is not the whole of the story either. Those of us who do not believe in God, a divine soul, or a beautiful universe need not be deprived of the right to use the word "philosophy."</page><page sequence="10">152 GUTHRIE ON THE EARLIER PRESOCRATICS Guthrie, borrowing freely from Aristotle (especially Metaphysics A), notes several methods and habits of mind which character ized almost all of those, from Tha?es on, who worked with the philosophers' myth. These are methods and habits, he points out, which by themselves, even when they were cut off from the myth that nourished them, led to powerful, revolutionary ideas. First of all, the substitution of a single ruler of phenomena for many petty and conflicting ones had the effect of making men search for the causes of events within nature itself, not outside it. And the belief that this single ruler was ungenerated and eternal naturally led men to the assumption that the causes at work at the beginning of our world are still at work. Also the feeling that a kinship existed between our own minds and the intelligence behind phenomena led men eventually to the conviction that they ought to be able to comprehend the arrangement of the universe and the purpose of the forces at work in it: that nature really did exhibit a rationally comprehensible order (Guthrie, pp. 140, 208). All three of these steps, Guthrie argues, had to be made before science and "philosophy" (in a broader, modern sense) could begin. A great deal of the work of an historian of Greek philosophy is just hard reasoning: making sure that he has considered all the logical possibilities and has drawn the most reasonable inferences each time a choice has had to be made between alternative in terpretations. Fortunately, the ability to juggle tricky evidence and reason clearly and correctly is one of Guthrie's most con spicuous virtues. As a result, even if the reader finds himself out of sympathy with the central vision in this History, he will profit a thousand times from the individual discussions of particular puzzles. But if the central vision is correct?and I am inclined to believe that it probably is?then the History, when complete, will be better than any to date. Not that Guthrie has solved all the puzzles that he touches on, heaven knows; that would be asking the impossible. But this first volume is fascinating and a very im portant contribution. And there are many signs that what Guthrie will have to say about the later Greek philosophers will be just as fascinating and just as important.</page></plain_text>
