However, only self-sufficient articles will be published, and not news items, book reviews, critical notices, or "discus sion notes" (short or long). The journal specializes in papers of a particular sort, those manifesting a strong interaction between contemporary and his torical concerns. Either historical material should be exploited to deal with matters on the agenda of current discussion, or present-day concepts, methods, distinctions, arguments, etc., should be used to illuminate historical questions. MANUSCRIPTS Contributions may be as short as 3,000 words or as long as 8,000. All manu scripts should be typewritten with wide margins, and at least double spacing between lines. Footnotes should be used sparingly and should be numbered consecutively, typed with wide margins and double spacing, placed at the end of the paper. Submissions should be made both by hard copy in triplicate and also sent either on a diskette or as an e-mail attachment to Catherine.wilson@ubc.ca. The journal will consider only papers whose authors certify that, while under con sideration with us, their papers will not be submitted elsewhere for consideration.</page><page sequence="3">History of Philosophy Quarterly Contents for Volume 19 / Number 2 (April 2002) James B.
