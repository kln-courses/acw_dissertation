Vasil'ev1 The area of the Middle and Upper Yenisei is one of the most important concen trations of Paleolithic sites in Northern Asia. More than 200 localities, belong ing to various stages of the Paleolithic, are now known. The initial phase of the Late Paleolithic is represented by Malaya Syiya, which is dated to approx imately 34,000-33,000 B.P. The middle phase of the Late Paleolithic is marked by the blade industries of Early Sartan age (24,000-18,000 B.P.), as at Shlenka, Tarachikha, Ui I, and elsewhere. At 18,000-16,000 B.P., these were replaced by the Final Paleolithic Afontova and Kokorevo cultures, although some of the earlier blade industries continued into this period (Golubaya I). KEY WORDS: Siberia; Late Paleolithic; Yenisei; Afontova culture; Kokorevo culture. INTRODUCTION The upper and middle reaches of the valley of the River Yenisei have one of the most important concentrations of Late Paleolithic sites not only in North ern Asia, but in the whole of Russia. Paleolithic research in this huge area is now entering its second century. Several tens of stratified sites are known, and the total number of sites investigated before 1981 approaches 200 (Abramova et al., 1991). The active program of fieldwork carried out by archaeologists from St. Petersburg and Krasnoyarsk has greatly increased the number of known sites during the last few years. The Yenisei sites have long been seen as the key to the Northern Asian Paleolithic and were the basis for assumptions about the character of Late Paleolithic development in Siberia. Even today, one cannot ignore the Yenisei evidence when discussing the periodization of the Siberian 'institute for the History of Material Culture, Russian Academy of Sciences, Dvortsovaya nab. 18, St. Petersburg 191065, Russia. 337 0892-7537/92/0900-O337$06.5O/0 ? 1992 Plenum Publishing Coiporation</page><page sequence="2">338 VasiPev Stone Age, the identification of local industries, and comparison of the Northern Asian sequence with those of Japan, China, and the New World. This explains the close attention paid by scholars of many countries to the Yenisei Paleolithic. This synthesis cannot cover all aspects of the Yenisei Late Paleolithic, but a critical reexamination of the available data in the light of new concepts is a regular need in scientific research. My primary aim is to review the Late Paleo lithic of the Yenisei, taking into consideration the results of recent fieldwork. I discuss some general problems of the culture history of the area and different methodological viewpoints. In this connection, we must consider the problem of stadial evolution vs local peculiarities in the development of Paleolithic cul ture. HISTORY OF RESEARCH Paleolithic studies in the Yenisei began in the 1880s, when Savenkov dis covered the sites at Afontova Gora in Krasnoyarsk?one of the first Paleolithic sites in Russia. He also organized a survey of the Yenisei valley from Kras noyarsk to Minoussinsk in search of Paleolithic sites. In the 1920s and 1930s, research was carried out by a number of prominent scholars (Merhart, Auerbach, Gromov, and Sosnovsky). Their fieldwork concentrated on the cluster of strat ified sites at Afontova Gora. Study of the Kokorevo-Novoselovo sites began at the same time. The third stage of Paleolithic studies in the Yenisei, from the 1960s to 1980s, involved large-scale salvage projects. In 1960, Abramova began the study of the Paleolithic sites in the Middle Yenisei, which were to be destroyed by the building of the Krasnoyarsk reservoir. In the 1960s, the major research activities were in the Kokorevo-Novoselovo region, and the results of these efforts have been summarized in a series of papers (Abramova, 1971, 1975b, 1984a, 1989) and in two monographs (Abramova, 1979a,b). In 1965, a large group of Late Paleolithic sites was identified in the Upper Yenisei area (Astak hov, 1986a). These were excavated (VasiPev, 1990a,b), and there was a new campaign on the high terraces of the Middle Yenisei (Lisitsyin, 1986a). Research is currently being carried out by the very active group of archae ologists from Krasnoyarsk. Expeditions, organized by the Laboratory of Archae ology and Paleogeography of Central Siberia, Krasnoyarsk Pedagogical College and Regional Museum, are conducting intensive fieldwork in the vicinity of Krasnoyarsk and on the left bank of the Yenisei, near Kurtak. The international symposium on the chronostratigraphy of the Paleolithic of Northern, Central, and Eastern Asia and America, held in Novosibirsk in 1990 (Drozdov et al., 1990), provides an important summary of the available data.</page><page sequence="3">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 339 GEOGRAPHICAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK In this paper, I discuss only the sites in the valley of the Yenisei, a huge area stretching 600 km from north to south. I do not cover the large series of surface localities (discovered primarily by Astakhov) in the upper reaches of the Yenisei in the Tuva area, since Tuva has closer cultural and physiographical affinities to Central Asia than to Northern Asia. Similarly, I omit the sites in the valley of the River Kan (Strizhova Gora, Potanchet, Mezensk, etc.), a right tributary of the Yenisei, being investigated by scholars from Irkutsk. These sites have much in common with the Paleolithic of the Angara and Lena basins and should be considered within the framework of the prehistory of the Eastern Baikal culture area. On the other hand, it would be wrong to separate the Yenisei sites from those in the upper reaches of River Chulyim (Malaya Syiya, Berezovyi Ruchei I). Although Chulyim is in the Ob' river basin, the geographical distance between the Yenisei and the Chulyim systems is too small to have constituted a barrier to the movement of prehistoric people, and the data from this region are crucial for discussion of the interrelations of the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures (see below). In the area under study, the Yenisei runs mainly north, crossing several mountain ridges and depressions. Its flow begins in the central Tuva basin with the confluence of the Rivers Bii-Khem (Big Yenisei) and Kaa-Khem (Small Yenisei) (Fig. 1). Farther downstream, it crosses the West Sayan mountains, forming a picturesque canyon (called "the tube"). Near Sayanogorsk, the river enters the steppe lowlands of the Minoussinsk depression, which consists of local basins [Southern Minoussinsk (or Abakan-Minoussinsk), Middle Minous sinsk, and Northern Minoussinsk] divided by low mountain ridges. These depressions are bounded by the Kuznetskii Alatau mountains on the west and the East Sayan mountains on the east. Farther north, upstream from Krasnoy arsk, the Yenisei cuts the East Sayan cliffs in a kind of gorge. All the sites known are concentrated in several clusters (Fig. 1), while huge areas remain essentially blank. In the valley north of Krasnoyarsk, the site of Druzhinikha (discovered in the 1960s) is still an isolated point on the distribution map. Still farther north, the middle reaches of the Yenisei, Lower Angara, Podkamennaya Tunguska, and Nizhnyaya Tunguska valleys seem to be very promising, especially in light of the recent discoveries at Ust'Kova. The main stratified sites are clustered in three areas. The northernmost concentration is near Krasnoyarsk, at the junction of the river and the East Sayan mountains. The first Paleolithic sites here were discovered by Savenkov, but more research is now needed. The most recent surveys have revealed several interesting localities (Listvenka, Bolshaya Slizneva, etc.). The discovery of Paleolithic sites in previously unsuspected geomorphological situations (Shal unin Byik, KarauFnyii Byik) requires a reevaluation of our views on prehistoric</page><page sequence="4">^^jf'KRASNOYARSK \ "AN = ABACAN^?

The famous sites of Afontova Gora, which were intensively excavated in the 1920s and 1930s, lie within the city of Krasnoyarsk and have now been mostly destroyed by the railway. However, a few sections survive which can be correlated with those described by Savenkov, Auerbach, and Gromov. The stratigraphy and dating of Afontova Gora remain uncertain (see below) but could be resolved by modem, multidisciplinary studies of these remnants. The regions around Krasnoyarsk have yielded only rare, scattered finds. The second concentration of stratified sites is on the left bank of the Yenisei in the Northern Minoussinsk depression. Many important sites are located here: Kokorevo I-VI, Novoselovo I-XIII, Kurtak I-VI, Cheremushka I?II, Chegerak, Krutogorskoe, Pervomaiskoe, Tarachikha, Afanas'eva Gora, Shlenka, Aeshka I-III, etc. The right bank of the Yenisei valley in the Minoussinsk depressions yields mostly deflated surface sites and rare stratified localities (such as Buzunovo and Potroshilovo), but there are several well-known sites on the left bank in inner Khakassia (Malaya Syiya, Dvuglazka Shelter). There are also surface sites known in the valley of the Abakan and its tributaries (Matkechik, Ust'Sos, etc.), as well as on the lake shores in the Koibal steppe lowlands, near the Abakan Yenisei watershed. The third cluster of stratified sites is at the northernmost part of the so called Sayan canyon near the edge of the West Sayan mountains, in the vicinity of Maina (Oznachennoe I, Bolshoi Karak, Maininskii Lesozavod, Maina, Ui I?II, Sizaya I-XVI, Golubaya I-VIII, Dzhoi, and Kantegir). Farther south, Nizhnii Idzhir I is the only stratified site known in the innermost West Sayans. Chronologically, the Late Paleolithic sequence spans the period from the second half of the Karginsk Interglacial, or Mega-Interstadial, (50,000-24,000/ 22,000 B.P.), to the Last Glacial (Sartan: 22,000-10,000 B.P.). There has been considerable debate in Siberian Quaternary geology about the status of the Kar ginsk. Some (Arkhipov, 1971) consider the Last Glacial of Northern Asia (the Zyiryansk) to correspond to the entire Wurm-Wisconsin {sensu lato), in which an early stage (Ermakov or Muruktin) was followed by the Karginsk Mega Interstadial and then by the Late (Sartan) Glacial phase. Others (Kind, 1974) see these as two separate glaciations and thus regard the Karginsk as a full interglacial. Within the late Karginsk, an optimal warm phase (Malokhetsk epi sode: 43,000-33,000 B.P.) was followed by the Konoschel cold phase (33,000 22,000 B.P.) and the terminal, Lipovo-Novoselovo warm phase (30,000-22,000 B.P.). The Sartan is divided into the Gyidan phase (22,000-16,000 B.P.), the Early Interstadial (16,000-15,500 B.P.), and the N'yapan phase (15,000-13,000 B.P.). The Final Pleistocene is marked by the two clear warm periods, corre sponding to Allerod and Boiling in the European scheme: the Kokorevo (13,000 12,200 B.P.) and Taimyir (11,800-11,400 B.P.) interstadials. The Terminal</page><page sequence="6">342 VasiFev Pleistocene witnessed a short, but very cold, phase, the Noril'sk (11,400-10,300 B.P.). This sequence is somewhat oversimplified and the real paleogeography of the Last Glacial in Siberia was doubtless much more complex. Glacial events in the Late Pleistocene were marked by the development of relatively small valley-glaciers in the mountainous areas around the Minoussinsk depression. The main cryogenic phases, represented by the numerous disturb ances seen in stratigraphic profiles, date to the maximal Sartan episodes: 19,000 16,000, 15,000-13,000, and approximately 10,500 B.P. According to the paly nological and paleozoological data, during the Sartan, the Minoussinsk depres sion and adjacent areas were a periglacial cold steppe with scattered stands of trees. During interstadials, the woodland areas expanded. The stratigraphic sequence has been carefully worked out for the lower Yenisei terraces. According to Tseitlin (1979), the basal channel alluvium (boul ders and pebbles) and the overlying stratum of "normal,'' floodplain alluvial beds of the second terrace (12-16 m above the modern river) are thought to have formed during the Karginsk epoch (30,000-25,000 B.P.). They are over lain by periglacial alluvial sands and sandy loams of Late Sartan age (16,000 13,000 B.P.). The top of the cross section consists of Final Pleistocene sandy loams or loams with traces of buried soils (13,000-11,000 B.P.). A firm chronological framework has not yet been established. Until very recently, our knowledge was based only on Final Pleistocene sites (approxi mately 16,000-10,000 B.P.), which made it difficult to correlate the Yenisei evidence with the Paleolithic of other regions of Siberia, where sites of the early and middle phases of the Upper Paleolithic were well known. However, the recent massive destruction of Quaternary sediments on the banks of the Kras noyarsk reservoir and the consequent exposure of earlier strata have led to the discovery of numbers of sites dating to Early Sartan and Karginsk. Unfortu nately, the available data are still not adequate to solve the problem of the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition in this area or to identify cultural variants during the initial phases of the Late Paleolithic. The discovery of Paleolithic sites on the high terraces now makes it nec essary to work out the stratigraphy of the uppermost beds and the correlation of the loess series and buried soils. Scholars have paid little attention to this prob lem until very recently, since, as noted above, the majority of sites were located on the lower terraces. As for the latter, the results of current fieldwork near Maina in the Upper Yenisei area necessitate a revision of the scheme proposed by Ravsky and Tseitlin (1965). The occurrence of roughly contemporaneous alluvial beds at different elevations contradicts traditional concepts of terrace formation. In this connection, the hypothesis of "polycyclical" terraces, put forward by Yamskikh (1987), is of special interest. In several cases, scholars have tried to interpret cross-sections by making direct correlation with the sub divisions of the Karginsk and Sartan periods worked out by Kind (1974). How</page><page sequence="7">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 343 ever, Kind's scheme was based primarily on data from the area of Ust'-Yenisei (the Yenisei Mouth) Port and the scheme is not likely to be directly applicable to areas some 1500-2000 km farther south. Although the main Pleistocene climatic oscillations were global in scale, environmental conditions in the region under study were apparently affected by glacial events and tectonic movements in neighboring areas, namely, the East and West Sayans and Kuznetskii Alatau mountains. These processes are not well understood, so that correlations of schemes worked out for the Yenisei valley and the provisional stratigraphic framework for the Altai-Sayan mountains (Borisov, 1984) seem dubious. The gaps in our knowledge cannot be filled without an improvement in lithic typology. At the moment, we use typologies which are only slightly mod ified versions of those used for the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. However, Northern Asian stone industries are more than a mechanical mixture of Middle and Upper Paleolithic tool-types. One of the most pressing problems for current Paleolithic studies in Northern Asia is the creation of a new typological frame work, specifically designed for the peculiarities of Siberian lithics, on the one hand, but also taking into account the rich experience of European typology, on the other. The completeness of our data is also limited by another important factor. The overwhelming majority of known sites are seasonal temporary camps, located near the river on sandy beaches. According to the faunal evidence, these habitations belong mostly to the warm season of the year. Thus, we have only small scattered fragments of the seasonal settlement system of Pleistocene hunter gatherers. Although there are some indications that the living floors at Kokorevo I were used during different seasons (Abramova, 1979b), these data have not been fully published and it is not clear how this is reflected in the tool-kits. Paleolithic sites are reported very unevenly in the archaeological literature. Only a few sites in the Kokorevo-Novoselovo area (Kokorevo I-IVA, Tashtyik I, II, Novoselovo VI, VII) and in the West Sayan area (Kantegir, Dzhoi, Golu baya I) have been fully described, and a number of important stratified sites (Maina, Ui I and II, Biriusa I, Listvenka etc.) remain unpublished. The problem is aggravated by the absence of a comprehensive publication of the Afontova Gora sites, which are crucial for our understanding of cultural development in this area, as well as being of more general interest. Some quantitative information relevant to the discussion below is presented in Table I. The numerous discrepancies in the data result from the different methods of classification used by different authors. THE EARLY PHASES OF LATE PALEOLITHIC DEVELOPMENT The initial phase of the Late Paleolithic sequence in the Yenisei area is obscure.

Abramova dated the Mousterian layers of Dvuglazka as earlier than 50,000 B.P. Lisitsyin found Levallois points at Kurtak IV, where the nearby cultural layer has a date on charcoal of 31,650 B.P. ? 520 years (LE-3352). We hope that current fieldwork in this region, which has led to the discovery of some Lower Paleolithic occurrences (Drozdov et al., 1990), may shed light on this problem. Levallois-Mousterian industries also predominated in adjacent areas (Tuva, Angara basin), but recent data from the Altai and Kuzbass areas bear witness to the great diversity of the Middle Paleolithic in Siberia, and we must keep our minds open concerning a similar phenomenon on the Yenisei. Malaya Syiya, on the eastern slopes of the Kuznetskii Alatau Mountains, is our main source of information about the earliest Late Paleolithic. The cultural layer is associated with alluvial and fan loams on the slope of a ravine in the valley of the River Belyii Iius. The fauna is characterized by a predominance of reindeer, aurochs, and wild sheep (argali), accompanied by woolly rhinoc eros, mammoth(?), roe deer, antelope, Siberian wild goat, horse, Asiatic wild ass, brown bear, and hare. The radiocarbon dates on bone, of 33,500 B.P. + 450 years (SOAN-1286) and 34,420 B.P. ? 360 years (SOAN-1287), are much older than the assay on charcoal?20,370 B.P. ? 340 years (SOAN-1124). Larichev (1978) reported the discovery of a thick cultural layer containing the remains of round subterranean dwellings. Unfortunately, the rich collection from this important site is essentially unpublished. Based on the available information (Larichev, 1978; Muratov et al., 1982), the industry is characterized by blade technology. There are large flat single-platform, cube-shaped, fan-shaped, and pyramidal cores. Most of the tools are wide blades with one or two retouched edges, endscrapers on flakes and blades, endscrapers on retouched blades (including carinated examples), longitudinal and transversal sidescrapers, sidescrapers on pebbles, various chop pers, burins, notched blades, and denticulated pieces. The site also yielded wide bone and antler points, antler hafts and pendants. This industry can be assigned to the Early Blade ("Epi-Levallois") assem blages, which directly overlie the Levallois-Mousterian in various parts of Sib eria. Clear Mousteroid traits still persist in these industries, found at such sites as Kara-Bom, Kara-Tenesh (Altai area), Tolbaga, Sokhatino I, Varvarina Gora, and the lower layers of Sannyii Cape (Trans-Baikal zone). Kurtak IV (Lisitsyin, 1988) is a more recent site. The cultural layer was at a depth of 4.5-5.0 m in the upper loams of the sixth (100-m) terrace, imme diately above the buried Kargin soil. The faunal remains include mammoth, a large bear, cave lion, aurochs, red deer, Asiatic wild ass, and argali. The numer ous radiocarbon dates on bone and charcoal cluster tightly between 24,000 and 23,000 B.P. The small collection from the site includes single- and double-platform</page><page sequence="11">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 347 cores on pebbles and pebble fragments; a pyramidal core was also found. All the tools are made on flakes, chips, or broken pebbles. Endscrapers on flakes (including pieces with two retouched lateral edges) dominate the tools. There are also large lateral and transversal sidescrapers (some made on split pebbles), denticulated sidescrapers, denticulates and notches, retouched flakes, bladelets with one retouched edge, and pick-like tools made on small split pebbles. Other finds include ivory tools, bone pieces, ivory disks, and pendants. Lisitsyin saw this industry as being a possible root of the Afontova culture, but the predom inance of flake technology and simple pebble-cores is too general a marker to use for tracing cultural sequences. Furthermore, some features of the industry reflect the functional peculiarities of the site, where the predominant activities were associated with splitting pebbles. The small collection from the fourth layer of the Dvuglazka Shelter (Abra mova, 1985) can be assigned to the early Late Paleolithic. Faunal remains include argali (predominant), yak, mammoth, and reindeer. The stone industry is characterized by blade technology, and a single-platform core on a pebble was found. The tools are retouched blades, a point made on a blade fragment, and endscrapers on retouched blades. There were also perforated bones, pen dants, and an unusual wedge-like bone tool with decoration and lateral incisions. The age of the artifacts found on the floor of Proskuryakov Cave in the valley of the River Belyii Iius (Okladnikov et aL, 1975) remains uncertain. They were associated with aurochs, horse, roe deer, mammoth, and rhinoceros. It is premature to comment on the presumed "Levallois" character of five blades found. THE MIDDLE PHASES OF LATE PALEOLITHIC DEVELOPMENT More is known about the middle Late Paleolithic, which is represented primarily by sites on the high-level terraces in the Middle Yenisei valley. Tarachikha is one of the most noteworthy sites of this group. The cultural material occurred in colluvial sandy loams (Abramova, 1983). The overwhelm ing majority of bones were of mammoth, but there were also reindeer, argali, aurochs, horse, Polar fox, and rodents. The stone industry is characterized by blade technology (60% of the tools were made on blades and bladelets; Fig. 2). Most cores are small; a few are medium-sized. They include flat single- and double-platform cores, Levallois-like blade cores, prismatic-like cores, and butt ended and atypical wedge-shaped cores. (Butt-ended cores are struck down the narrower face, so that the width of the flaking surface is less than the thickness of the core behind it. They resemble wedge-shaped cores but lack the trimming of the wedge which is characteristic of the latter.) Endscrapers on bladelets (microlithic, double, round, and thumbnail endscrapers) and retouched bladelets and flakes (some with alternate retouch or basal trimming) predominate among</page><page sequence="12">348 VasiPev Fig. 2.

The industry of Afanas'eva Gora (Lisitsyin, 1987a) (Fig. 2) is similar to that of Tarachikha. Here, the artifacts were in reddish-brown slope deposits, associated with mammoth bones. The majority of tools (74%) were made on bladelets struck from various single- and double-platform cores. Some cores resemble prismatic forms; butt-ended, discoidal, and conical cores and pieces resembling primitive wedge-shaped cores are less common. About a third of the tools are microliths, including backed bladelets (some with one or both ends truncated, or with concave bases, or double-backed), micropoints, and pieces with rounded bases or with two truncated ends. Burins are equally important and include dihedral, lateral, and angle forms. The site also yielded a number of bladelets with one or two retouched edges, endscrapers on flakes, truncated bladelets, retouched flakes, choppers, composite tools, notches, denticulates, and a peculiar borer with an elongated tip. The similarities between these two assemblages mean that we can assign them to the same cultural tradition. The differences could be interpreted as chronological (if Afanas'eva Gora is younger) or spatial variants within the culture. Unfortunately, the age of the sites is essentially unknown, although it is estimated to be 18,000-17,000 B.P. The third site of this period is Shlenka (Astakhov and Yamskikh, 1984). The artifacts were at a depth of 2.5 m in the laminated sandy loam of the upper deposits, which form the 70- to 80-m terrace. Mammoth and horse predominated in the fauna; aurochs, red deer, Asiatic wild ass, and argali were less common, while brown bear, elk (Alces), wolf, fox, polar fox, and marmot were rare. The site has four radiocarbon dates: 17,660 B.P. + 700 years and 18,600 B.P. ? 2000 years (GIN-2862, both on the same sample), 19,700 B.P. ? 200 years (GIN-2861), and 20,100 B.P. ? 100 years (GIN-2863). The investigators date the site to the beginning of the Sartan. The site is characterized by blade technology (&gt;70% of the tools were made on blades) based on small single- and double-platform cores; discoidal and conical cores also occur. Among the tools, bladelets with retouched edge, or with retouched edge and oblique base, predominate. There are also many endscrapers on blades and flakes (simple, rounded, carinated, or with retouched edges), as well as various notched tools and retouched flakes; retouched blades, choppers, lateral burins, borers on bladelets with elongated tips, and borers on flakes are less important. Bone tools are represented by a broken rod-like object. Lisitsyin (1986b) regarded the lowermost layer of Novoselovo XIII, which is in deposits of the 30- to 35-m terrace, as belonging to the middle phase of the Late Paleolithic. Unfortunately, the collection is too small to determine its cultural affiliation. The assemblage is characterized by small single- and double platform cores, including some resembling conical cores. There were also a</page><page sequence="14">350 Vasil'ev discoidal core, a fragment with traces of flaking on the end, endscrapers on flakes, retouched bladelets, and points. The upper layers of the site belong to the Kokorevo culture (see below). In the Upper Yenisei area, Ui I is located in remnants of the largely destroyed, 23- to 25-m terrace (Vasil'ev, 1983, 1988a). The lower (second) cultural layer was at a depth of about 3 m in periglacial alluvial deposits with traces of numerous ice wedges; it consisted of three habitation horizons. The faunal assemblage is dominated by Asiatic wild ass, aurochs, Siberian wild goat, and sheep (argali); there are also horse, red deer, tolai hare, fox, and marmot, while yak was identified in the overlying deposits. There are radiocarbon dates of 16,760 B.P. ? 120 years (LE-3358), 17,520 B.P. ? 130 years (LE-3359), 19,280 B.P. ? 200 years (LE-4257), and 22,830 B.P. ? 530 years (LE-4189). These place the assemblage in the early stages of Sartan and the cryogenic disturbance may be correlated with the initial phases of this glaciation. Several structural features were observed, including stone slab concentra tions, boulders arranged in a circle, and a light, aboveground hut with a hearth in the center; the hearth was surrounded by a "stone box" made of vertical slabs and boulders. An oval structure consisting of animal ribs driven into the ground vertically or at an angle is of particular interest; it may be a device for drying skins. The stone industry is characterized by the association of a variety of cores: various single-, double-, and three-platform cores, unifacial and bifacial dis coidal cores, triangular and oval Levallois cores, small prismatic, butt-ended and wedge-shaped cores, and pyramidal and conical cores. Only 24.4% of the tools were made on blades and bladelets. The majority of tools are endscrapers and splintered pieces. Most of the endscrapers are on flakes and include elon gated, short, and very short (that is, where the length is not greater than the width) forms, as well as dejete, asymmetrical, double, rounded, and finely made carinated scrapers; the large, wide endscrapers grade into sidescrapers. The splintered pieces have one or two working edges. There are also tools with marginal retouch, microliths, denticulates (including large denticulated side scrapers), Clactonian and ordinary notches, backed bladelets and micropoints, small symmetrical and asymmetrical points made on bladelets, retouched bladelets, and flakes. Hammerstones, retouchers, anvils, composite tools, and bifacial points are rare. The site also yielded a fragment of an antler point, bone borers, a retouched tool on a broken bone, and a perforated-tooth pendant. Technologically, this industry is similar to that of Shlenka, but it differs in typology from all the sites mentioned above. Taken together, the assemblages of the middle stage of the Yenisei Late Paleolithic seem to be part of the complex of bladelet industries which were widespread in Siberia between 27,000/24,000 and 18,000 B.P. (Mal'ta, Buret', Achinsk, Shestakovo, Tomsk, etc.). Medvedev called these assemblages "the</page><page sequence="15">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 351 classic complex" (Medvedev et al., 1986), and they are comparable to the European ("classic") sequence. However, there is pronounced geographical variability within this phase. For instance, we cannot refer such Yenisei assem blages as Tarachikha and Afanas'eva Gora to the Mal'ta culture because they lack the characteristic Mal'ta tool-types (small points with elongated or inversely truncated tips, double points, truncated bladelets, etc.). FINAL PALEOLITHIC DIVERSITY More than 90% of the Yenisei sites fall within the final stage of the Late Paleolithic (16,000-10,000 B.P.). Most of them are assigned to the Afontova culture, which was identified by Astakhov and Abramova. Sites belonging to this culture have been found in all three main concentrations in the Yenisei valley. The principal features of the Afontova culture are those which have been long considered as crucial for the Late Paleolithic of Siberia as a whole. The industry is based on flakes struck from heavy single- and double-platform cores on pebbles. The main tool classes are sidescrapers (including bifacial pieces), endscrapers, and splintered pieces; there are also numerous retouched flakes, notches, denticulates, small points, backed bladelets, and borers. Pebble tools occur in all assemblages. The sites at Afontova Gora ("Afontova Mountain") are the heart of the Afontova culture in the northern cluster. Astakhov (1966b) has scrupulously assembled all the data from the work carried out by Savenkov, Auerbach, Sos novsky, Gromov, and others at various times. The sites are on the slopes of Chernaya sopka ("Black Hill") between the Yenisei and the Bugach rivers. There are several terraces here (15-18, 25, 30, and 40 m), which are covered by loess-like sediments up to 10-14 m thick. The stratified site of Afontova Gora II (Auerbach and Sosnovsky, 1932) (Fig. 3) is one of the most noteworthy. It was on the southwestern slopes, and six areas were excavated. The most complete cross section was that in Exca vation Area 2. A loess-like bed, 1.5 m deep, contained the uppermost (B,, B2) cultural layers; the middle layers (C0, C,, C2) were in humic lenses; and the lowermost (C3) cultural layer was at a depth of 6 m, in pale brown, loess-like, sandy loams. The upper layers were traced only in Excavation Areas 2 and 3 and the middle layers in Excavation Area 2, while the bottom layer was iden tified throughout the site. The faunal remains from the uppermost horizons consist of mammoth, reindeer, aurochs, horse, and wolf. The lowermost layers yielded reindeer (pre dominant), mammoth, saiga, wild goat, mountain sheep, and hare; the presence of wolf bones with apparent signs of domestication is noteworthy. Astakhov has convincingly disproved Sosnovsky's (1935a) suggestion of dwellings in the lower</page><page sequence="16">352 VasiFev Fig. 3.

The site yielded human remains: in the lower layers, the bones of a hand, in anatomical position, were found among the kitchen debris, and one exposure yielded skull fragments of Homo sapiens sapiens with clear Mongoloid traits, according to Debetz. The upper cultural layers produced a small collection, including wedge shaped microcores, various sidescrapers, endscrapers on flakes, borers, and a discoidal tool. Most of the artifacts came from the lower layer. The industry is based on flakes struck from single-platform pebble cores. There were also flat, parallel-sided, and Levallois tortoise cores, wedge-shaped microcores, and con ical cores. About half of the tools are sidescrapers, some made on pebbles. The most frequent types are convex, longitudinal and transversal, double sidescrap ers, tools with three working edges, pebble scrapers with straight and concave edges, and convergent forms (including some with double tips). Many of the sidescrapers have trimmed distal ends. Endscrapers are represented by pieces made on blades and flakes and are short, very short, double, rounded, alternate, shouldered, or carinated. There was a series of ogival endscrapers, and some microscrapers. Splintered pieces are mostly flat and wide; tools with retouch along one or both lateral edges were identified, as were borers, small points, angle burins, bifacial foliate points, retouched flakes and blades, and notched pieces. The microliths include points with oblique truncations, backed bladelets, and notched bladelets. Heavy-duty tools are represented by finely made choppers, adze-like implements, and small bifacial axes. There is an important series of antler points, some with grooves along the axis or with slots near the tip. Other bone tools include awls, small points, needles, knives, wedge-shaped and rod-like pieces, an ivory spade, and frag ments of batons de commandement. Decorative objects are disks, pendants, and beads made of soft stone. The stratified site of Afontova Gora III is of no less importance (Auerbach, 1930). It is 700 m from Afontova Gora II, on the southeastern part of the hill near the Ivanikhin Log (a large ravine). The site consists of a cluster of habi tations. The uppermost cultural horizon was investigated only by Savenkov. Arti facts lay in white clay deposits below the loess-like loams, at a depth of 1.5 1.7 m. Reindeer was predominant in the fauna; mammoth was also found. Double-platform, unifacial discoidal, and butt-ended cores were identified. Sidescrapers were the predominant tools, including convex transversal and lon gitudinal pieces, inverse, double, and convergent scrapers, and scraper-points; there were also atypical Mousterian-like points on split pebbles, adzes, and choppers. Bone and antler tools include points, an ivory pick, a small spade, and an antler haft. Most of the points are oval in cross-section; some have a small slot near the tip or lack a groove.</page><page sequence="18">354 VasiPev At Locality 1, three cultural horizons were identified in the yellow loam, at depths of &gt;2 m. The faunal remains were of reindeer and mammoth. Auer bach discovered a round concentration of cultural debris, 2.5 m in diameter. The cores were single-platform on pebbles, butt-ended, Levallois, and atypical wedge-shaped. Sidescrapers are of prime importance (convex longitudinal and transversal, double longitudinal, with peripheral retouch, alternate and bifacial). The site also yielded endscrapers on flakes and blades, retouched blades, points, retouched flakes, grooved antler points, bone awls, and small ivory balls. At Locality 2, Savenkov subdivided the lower cultural layer into four hori zons. Faunal remains include mammoth, reindeer, and bear. The collection included single-platform pebble cores, butt-ended cores, rectangular wedge shaped microcores, and small, prismatic, butt-ended and cylindrical cores. Sidescrapers constitute slightly less than half of the tools [and are convex lon gitudinal forms (sometimes with trimmed transversal edges), transversal, inverse, alternate, bifacial, and convergent pieces]. The endscrapers on flakes include short and very short types, scrapers with lateral retouched edges and tanged and carinated scrapers. There were also atypical Mousterian-like points, adzes, retouched flakes, dihedral and angle burins, chisel-like and notched tools, chop pers, and points. This assemblage is accompanied by antler points with flat or oval cross section and with or without lateral grooves, bone awls, and bone needles. Locality 3 of Afontova Gora III is seen as a separate site. Auerbach found two cultural layers. The main, upper horizon was associated with humic lenses in the dark yellow loams. Faunal remains include mammoth, reindeer, and wolves with some signs of domestication. The excavations revealed a concen tration of chipped stone and a slab-lined hearth. Locality 3 yielded a huge collection of stone artifacts, including large cores on pebbles with both longitudinal and transversal flake-scars, butt-ended pebble cores, flat single- and double-platform cores, large prismatic cores, typical and atypical wedge-shaped microcores, and a noteworthy series of small prismatic, pencil-like, butt-ended cores, including some with bladelets struck from two perpendicular edges. Sidescrapers dominate the tool-kit and include convex lon gitudinal and transversal, double, triple, inverse, and convergent scrapers, con cave scrapers on pebbles, oval scrapers with peripheral trimming, scrapers with thinned back (a dos aminci), and finely made bifacial scrapers. Endscrapers are mainly short or very short and made on flakes, bladelets, and retouched blade lets; types represented include asymmetrical, double, rounded endscrapers with a concave base and microlithic scrapers. Splintered pieces are equally important, as are borers, dihedral burins, Mousterian-like points, points with oblique edge, backed bladelets, notched bladelets, notched and adze-like tools, and retouched blades and flakes. There is a notable series of antler points with oval or flattened cross sections and with or without lateral grooves; one piece has fir tree-like</page><page sequence="19">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 355 incisions. There are also awl-like points, needles, smoothers, a unique bone object with three holes, perforated antler fragments, and, as ornaments, ivory balls and disks, pendants, and beads made on soft stone. The lowermost horizon of Locality 3 of Afontova Gora III produced bones of reindeer and aurochs and a small artifact assemblage, including wedge-shaped microcores, retouched blades, double sidescrapers, rounded endscrapers, and a Mousterian-like point with rounded base. Astakhov (1966c) regarded Afontova Gora I, discovered by Savenkov, as belonging to roughly the same period as the lower layer of Afontova Gora II. This apparently two-layered site lay in the loess-like loams of the 18-m terrace. The fauna consisted of mammoth, aurochs, reindeer, and red deer, while the artifacts include sidescrapers, retouched flakes, pebble tools, and grooved antler points. Afontova Gora IV, discovered by Gromov and Sosnovsky, may be slightly younger. It is north of Afontova Gora II on the edge of Ivanikhin Log. The cultural material was embedded in colluvial deposits of the third terrace at a depth of 1-1.5 m. Bones of reindeer and aurochs were associated with the rare tools (mostly sidescrapers). The nearby site of Kacha I (Sosnovsky, 1948) is also worthy of note. The artifacts were found in the upper loams of the 16-m terrace. The faunal remains include reindeer, horse, Polar fox, and hare. The lithic industry is typical of the Afontova culture: wedge-shaped cores, sidescrapers (some of them inverse), endscrapers on flakes, retouched flakes, splintered pieces, burins, and retouched bladelets. There was also a reindeer rib with traces of incisions. Astakhov (1966b) has proposed a general stratigraphic succession for the Afontova Gora sites. The earliest group (the beginning of the occupation is estimated at 16,000 B.P.) includes the bottom layer (C3) of Afontova II and the third layer of Locality 3 of Afontova III; the bottom of Afontova Gora II is contemporaneous with Kacha II and Korovii Log. The main (second) layer of Afontova III (Localities 2 and 3), Layers C0, C,, and C2 of Afontova II, and the cultural layers of Locality 1 of Afontova III are slightly younger. The upper layer of Afontova III (excavated by Savenkov) and Afontova I can be correlated with the Kokorevo Interstadial (12,000-11,000 B.P.). Presumably, Pereselen cheskii Punkt (see below) belongs to the same period. In addition, the latest group includes Layers B!-B2 of Afontova II and Afontova IV. The uppermost horizons of Afontova II are comparable to Kacha I and the Paleolithic material from Ladeiki, Gremyachii Kliuch, and Layer C of Biriusa I. The radiocarbon dates for the cross sections of Afontova Gora II [11,330 B.P. ? 270 years (Mo-343) and 20,900 B.P. + 300 years (GIN-117)] seem unlikely. The second date is considered (Tseitlin, 1979) to correspond to Layer C3, in which case the lowermost horizon of Afontova Gora II would be the oldest known assemblage of the Afontova culture. Some authors (KhoFushkin,</page><page sequence="20">356 VasiPev 1985) have used this hypothesis as a basis for models of the gradual divergence of a single culture into two variants, namely, Afontova and Kokorevo (see below). Other scholars (Abramova, 1979a; Astakhov, 1966b, 1986b) believe that the lower horizon of Afontova II belongs to the same period as Kokorevo II (17,000-15,000 B.P.), a position which seems more consistent with both the geological setting and the archaeological evidence. The industry from Pereselencheskii Punkt (Sosnovksy, 1935b) is similar to the Afontova Gora assemblages. The cultural material was associated with allu vial sands of the 10- to 12-m terrace. In the fauna, reindeer was dominant, but there were also red deer, wild goat, roe deer, aurochs, wolf, cave lion, hare, and white grouse. According to the stratigraphy, the site is younger than the lower layers of Afontova Gora II and could be contemporary with Kokorevo I. The lithic industry is based on flake technology, with typical wedge-shaped cores. The most important tools are endscrapers on flakes: short, very short, rounded, dejete, scrapers with lateral retouched edges, and microscrapers. There are also many sidescrapers (simple convex longitudinal and transversal, dejete, bifacial half-moon-shaped, and oval with peripheral trimming). Splintered pieces, small points, foliate points with a truncated rounded base, retouched flakes, notches, denticulates, and borers are reported, as well as a bone awl, an antler polisher, and other bone tools. Listvenka, near Krasnoyarsk, is a very important and complex site currently being investigated (Drozdov et aL, 1990). The cultural layers occur in perigla cial alluvial strata, which form the 22- to 24-m terrace. Twenty-six cultural horizons have been identified in 9.5 m of deposits. Reindeer, wild goat, horse, elk (Alces), aurochs, wolf, fox, and hare occurred, and the basal part of the sediments yielded mammoth. A round, slab-lined dwelling (4.2-4.5 m in diam eter) was found in Layer 16. The investigators of the site regard the lowermost horizons (14-19) as belonging to the Afontova culture, the middle portion of the sequence (Layers 7-13) is attributed to the Kokorevo culture, and the upper most levels (2-6) to the Final Afontova culture. If the forthcoming analyses of the stone industry support this framework, this will be a unique case of inter stratification of the two cultural components. Other recent discoveries in the Krasnoyarsk area include the site of Bol'shaya Slizneva (Vdovin et aL, 1990). The cultural material was in deposits of the 10- to 12-m terrace; Layers 3-7 are of Sartan Age. Apart from lithics typical of the Afontova culture, the site yielded unique specimens of worked bone and antler, including a finely made, engraved baton de commandement, an antler haft, an antler hammer, a noteworthy series of antler points in various stages of manufacture, a point with four grooves, a bone mortar, and needles. The Paleolithic material from sites at elevations above the cliffs (KarauFnyii Byik, Shalunin Byik) is equally important (Makarov and Yamskikh, 1990). The lithic industries from these sites are somewhat impoverished assemblages of the Afontova culture.</page><page sequence="21">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 357 A typical Afontova-culture industry was obtained during excavation of Bir iusa 1 (Auerbach and Gromov, 1935; Gurina, 1964; Khlobyistin, 1972). The artifacts were associated with the 11- to 11.5-m terrace. The Neolithic horizons overlay a loam traditionally regarded as Mesolithic (Layer B of Auerbach and Gromov, 1935). The Paleolithic horizons (Layer C) were beneath this, in lam inated sands and sandy loams; Auerbach and Gromov (1935) saw four habitation levels within this layer, while Gurina (1964) identified eight thin floors. Layer B yielded aurochs, horse, sheep or goat, roe deer, elk (Alces), reindeer, wolf, hare, and a single mammoth bone (presumably found elsewhere by the prehis toric inhabitants of the site). Reindeer predominated in the lowermost horizons. It is very doubtful that Layer B is Mesolithic: the geological data (Tseitlin, 1979) place it in the Final Sartan (10,800-10,300 B.P.) and the stone industry is indistinguishable from that of the underlying horizons. The rich collection of bone and antler items is all that is yet published; they include grooved points (one with V-shaped engravings), borers, needles, and pendants of deer teeth. The character of BoFshoi Kemchug, about 90 km farther west of Krasnoy arsk, remains obscure. Okladnikov (1981) mentioned that Gobi cores were accompanied by large Levallois cores. The site has a radiocarbon date of 10,890 B.P. ? 60 years (SOAN-1126). There is a large group of sites of the Afontova culture in the Kokorevo Novoselovo area. The stratified site of Kokorevo IVA is of special importance (Astakhov, 1987). It was on the second terrace, below the uppermost deposits, which have remnants of a buried soil (the first and second cultural horizons were in the lower portion of the soil). The base of the cross section is laminated alluvial sands containing cultural Layers 2a-5. The fauna consists of reindeer (dominant), aurochs, red deer, hare, and birds; a mammoth bone was found in Layer 3. The radiocarbon date of 14,320 B.P. ? 330 years (LE-469) was obtained on a combined sample of charcoal from Layers 3 and 5. Many hearths were discovered during the excavation; Astakhov regarded one of the domestic units with a hearth in Layer 5 as the remains of a light aboveground dwelling. The stone industry was based on flakes struck from heavy single-platform and discoidal cores. Double-, three-platform, and triangular Levallois cores are of less importance. There was a notable series of wedge-shaped and butt-ended microcores. Among the tools, sidescrapers are dominant. More than a third of them are convex longitudinal (mainly made on flakes, rarely on blades); convex transversal and inverse sidescrapers and scrapers with peripheral trimming are rarer. Other tool types are straight and concave longitudinal and transversal, dejete, angle, and bifacial scrapers; many tools show trimming of the transversal edges. There are many pebble tools: typical choppers and tools with two or three working edges, as well as pick-like pieces and elongated tools made on broken pebbles. Endscrapers are represented by short and very short types on flakes, nosed scrapers, shouldered scrapers, endscrapers notched behind the</page><page sequence="22">358 Vasil'ev working end, and pieces with retouched lateral edges. The splintered pieces include tools with one to four working edges and small triangular chisels. Retouched blades, bladelets and flakes, burins, small elongated points, borers, notched and denticulated pieces, and composite tools are rare. There were many grooved, oval-sectioned antler points, flattened points without grooves, bone needles, borers, polishers, a perforated bone, and a deer-tooth pendant. Kokorevo II is another site of the Afontova culture in the same area (Fig. 4) (Abramova, 1979a). The thick cultural layer was &gt;5 m below the surface, in the loams of the second terrace. Abramova regards the date of 13,330 B.P. ?100 years (GIN-90) as too young and tries to correlate the buried soil beneath the cultural layer with the Early Sartan Interstadial (approximately 16,000 15,000 B.P.). The occurrence of numerous mammoth bones is crucial because they are absent from other Final Pleistocene assemblages; there were also rein deer and rare remains of horse, aurochs, argali, red deer, elk (Alces), tiger-lion, saiga, wolf, Polar fox, hare, and white goose. The stone industry is based on flake technology. Large cores are rare (although there was one large wedge-shaped piece); the microcores are wedge shaped (including elongated pieces), butt-ended, double, conical, celt-like, and prismatic. Among the tools, endscrapers on bladelets and flakes are dominant, as well as splintered pieces and sidescrapers. The site yielded many nosed, asymmetrical, lateral, dejete, rounded, and double endscrapers; microscrapers are also worthy of note. The splintered pieces have one or two working edges of various forms, including elongated and microlithic pieces. Sidescrapers are mostly convex longitudinal and transversal; double, dejete, inverse, and oval bifacial examples are more rare. There are unusual types of carinated, pointed, and triple sidescrapers, retouched flakes (some bifacial), small points, borers, oblique transversal burins, bees, Mousterian-like points, laterally retouched bladelets, and arched retouched bladelets; composite tools are well represented (sidescraper-splintered pieces, endscraper-splintered pieces, etc.). The bone and antler industry includes grooved points, flat points or polishers, awls with enlarged heads, needles, bone objects with triangular tips, bone rods, bone "pipes," and fragments of thin "diadems." There are also stone beads. Lisitsyin (1986a) regarded Kurtak III as belonging to the Afontova culture. The cultural layer was at a depth of &gt; 3m in the upper sandy loams of the sixth (100-m) terrace. Among the faunal remains were reindeer and aurochs. The radiocarbon dates are 14,300 B.P. + 100 years (LE-1457), 14,390 B.P. ? 100 years (LE-1456), 14,600 B.P. ? 200 years (GIN-2101), and 16,900 B.P. + 700 years (GIN-2102). The site yielded single- and double-platform and dis coidal pebble cores, butt-ended and wedge-shaped microcores, numerous chop pers, longitudinal and transversal sidescrapers, endscrapers, splintered pieces, and rare small points, borers, and finely made burins. Among the bone tools, an antler point with flattened base, an antler hammer, and a perforated antler section are of special interest.</page><page sequence="23">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 359 Fig. 4.

Bones of reindeer and aurochs were accompanied by single-platform and wedge-shaped cores, endscrapers on flakes, sidescrapers, and a grooved antler point. The collection from Pervomaiskoe II (Lisitsyin, 1980a) may also be attrib uted to the Afontova culture. The stratified sites of Tashtyik I and II, located on the second terrace, can be assigned to the Afontova culture (Abramova, 1979a). The three cultural horizons of Tashtyik I were in the alluvial sandy loams beneath the sandy soils. The overwhelming majority of the fauna is reindeer; there were also horse, argali, polar fox, and white goose and rare red deer, saiga, aurochs, cave lion, wolf, hare, and marmot. The uppermost layer yielded a radiocarbon date of 12,180 B.P. ? 120 years (LE-771). The lithic assemblages are very similar in all layers. The industry is char acterized by single- and double-platform cores, wedge-shaped and butt-ended microcores of various proportions, and small prismatic cores. Among the tools, sidescrapers are dominant and include convex longitudinal and transversal, dou ble, concave scrapers on pebbles and chips, convergent, inverse, dejete scrapers, scrapers with thinned backs (a dos aminci), subtriangular and oval pieces with peripheral trimming, and bifacial pieces; trimming of the transversal edges is common. Endscrapers are slightly less important; they are represented by short and very short pieces made on flakes, rounded, dejete scrapers, and scrapers with lateral notches and a concave base; scrapers made on blades are rarer. The splintered pieces include typical pieces ecaillees and subtriangular chisel-like forms. Retouch along the lateral edges is a characteristic feature of this industry. Pebble tools are very variable. Apart from the choppers, there are peculiar tools resembling chopping tool-knives with hand grips, as well as adze-like and ax like tools. Retouched bladelets and flakes occur. The borers are of special inter est, being elongated dihedral tools on bladelets (some of them shouldered) and dihedral and corner types on flakes. Rare tool types include composite tools, small points, dihedral burins, and bifacial pieces. There are also ungrooved antler points, a large bone "boar-spear," bone awls, needles, rods, and stone beads. Tashtyik II is on the same terrace. The two cultural layers were at a depth of 4.0-4.8 m in the alluvial sandy loams. Most of the bones are reindeer, with smaller quantities of horse, saiga, aurochs, argali, hare, and white goose. Hearths and the remains of a lithic workshop were discovered. Heavy cores are rare, while wedge-shaped and butt-ended microcores form a noteworthy series. Among the tools are many endscrapers (double, rounded, shouldered, and microlithic), splintered pieces (the usual pieces ecaillees, sub triangular chisels, and microlithic forms), and sidescrapers (convex longitudinal and transversal, double, dejete, inverse scrapers, and oval bifacial pieces), as</page><page sequence="25">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 361 well as borers, points made on bladelets, Mousterian-like points, and choppers. The first layer yielded grooved antler points (one of them still had small flints inserted in the slot), thin spindle-shaped antler points with forked base, bone needles, pendants of reindeer teeth, and a small incised pebble. Kokorevo III is apparently younger (Abramova, 1979a). The cultural mate rial was associated with fan deposits, overlying the alluvial deposits of the second terrace. The faunal remains are reindeer, aurochs, horse, argali, hare, etc. The radiocarbon date of 12,690 B.P. ? 149 years (LE-629) corresponds well to the geological position of the cultural layer. The stone industry is based on single- and double-platform and discoidal cores on pebbles; there are also finely made, wedge-shaped (some made on elongated flakes) and butt-ended microcores. As at Kokorevo II, endscrapers predominate: short and very short scrapers on flakes, rounded, double, tanged endscrapers, pieces with lateral notches, with proximal burins, and microscrap ers; a noteworthy series consists of wide heavy forms transitional to sidescrapers. The latter are mostly longitudinal convex, dejete, and bifacial. There are also chisel-like tools, retouched bladelets, borers, burins, notches, denticulates, ungrooved antler points, a fragment of a possible baton de commandement, and bone needles. Kokorevo VI (Grigor'eva, 1964) falls within the same period. It is on a part of the second terrace which has been technically lowered. The thick cultural layer was at a depth of 1-2 m in the loams beneath the buried soil. The faunal assemblage consists of reindeer, horse, and aurochs. Single-platform, discoidal, conical, and prismatic cores were found, as well as sidescrapers (including oval pieces with peripheral trimming and inverse trimming of the tip). Other tools are endscrapers on flakes, double and rounded endscrapers, microlithic end scrapers on flakes, chisel-like tools, borers, lateral and dihedral burins, pebble tools, and retouched flakes, as well as flattened and grooved antler points and pebble pendants. There is obviously some admixture of Neolithic artifacts. The Afontova culture was widely distributed throughout the southern areas. One might also mention the sites at Tagarskii Island (Abramova and Leont'ev, 1980) and Sosnovoe Lake I-IV (Lisitsyin, 1983a). In the 1950s, a small storage pit lined with limestone slabs was found near Sosnovoe Lake (Lipsky, 1963); the objects found in this unique cache included flat antler points with and without grooves, sidescrapers, and flakes. Unfortunately, the available data are not sufficient to permit cultural iden tification of the interesting site of Oznachennoe I. The cultural layer was buried in the upper loams, which form a terrace-like level on the slope of the Sayan Mountains (Astakhov and Vasil'ev, 1983). The site yielded radiocarbon dates of 14,100 B.P. ? 150 years (LE-1404) and 15,020 B.P. ? 150 years (LE 1404; both obtained on the same sample). In the southern cluster of sites, the key locality for the Afontova culture is</page><page sequence="26">362 Vasil'ev undoubtedly the stratified site of Maina (Vasil'ev, 1984, 1988a, 1990a,b; Vasil'ev and Ermolova, 1983; Vasil'ev et a/., 1986, 1987). The site is on the left bank of the Yenisei, near the mouth of the River Ui. An important feature of the site is its division into two parts. The western (upper) part of the site was associated with deposits of the third (25- to 27-m) terrace. Beneath the modern soil with Neolithic remains were the upper sands, containing a series of cultural horizons (A-l, A-2, A-3, B). These sediments were underlain by thinly laminated alluvial sands, containing Layers G and V. The geological age of the sediments is unclear. Siberian wild goat and red deer predominated among the fauna and were accompanied by aurochs, argali, Asiatic wild ass, wolf, and birds; roe deer are a permanent component of the fauna from Layer B onward. A combined radiocarbon sample from Layer A yielded a date of 11,700 B.P. + 100 years (LE-3019), Layer A-l a date of 12,110 B.P. ? 220 years (LE-4255), and Layer B a date of 15,200 B.P. ? 150 years (LE-2383). In the eastern (lower) part of the site, cultural material was associated with deposits forming the second (16- to 18-m) terrace, banked against the cliffs. The cross section revealed the upper sandy loams with two clearly distinct buried soils (the lower horizon contained cultural Layer 0); the first cultural layer was directly underneath. The laminated alluvial sands at a depth of 3-7 m yielded several Paleolithic horizons (2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3, 3a, 3b, and 4-9). Faunal remains include red deer, Siberian wild goat (the dominant species), aurochs, argali, elk (Alces), hare, and rare bones of horse, glutton, fox, and birds. The radiocarbon dates are given in Table II. The paleomagnetic dates also provide a chronological framework. The low ermost part of the alluvial sediments (cultural Layer 9) yielded a date of 19,000 B.P., the middle part (slightly below Layer 3a) a date of 14,100 B.P., and the Table II.

Comparison of the site with the stratigraphic schemes worked out for the second terrace of the Yenisei shows that the buried soil (including Layer 0) could belong to the Kokorevo interstadial (approximately 12,500 B.P.), while Layer 1, in the bottom of the covering strata, could be slightly earlier; Layers 2-9 may be of Late Sartan age (18,000-13,000 B.P.). The living floors in the lower horizons of the site consisted of irregularly scattered charcoal lenses and concentrations of cultural debris around these hearths (some of which were slab-lined). There were also numerous workshops (large clusters of chipped stone); a cache of stone tools in Layer 3 in the southern part of the site is of particular interest. In the upper layers (A-l to A-3), the habitation area is divided into the two parts: hearths occurred in the southern part, where butchering and cooking took place (Layer A-3 yielded the remains of a light above-ground dwelling); the northern part was a specialized workshop area with several dense concentrations of chipped stone. The stone industry was based on flakes (70-85% of the tools in most of the assemblages were made on flakes). These were struck from heavy single (rarely double-)-platform cores. There were also butt-ended, unifacial, discoidal, and multiple-platform cores, as well as flat Levallois-like cores; Layer 5 yielded cores resembling rough wedge-shaped types. The microblade technology was based on various wedge-shaped and butt-ended microcores. Unusual elongated wedge-shaped cores made on retouched blades from Layer 3 and elongated cores made on flakes from the uppermost horizons (A-l to A-3) are noteworthy. The latter assemblages also contained double butt-ended and celt-like microcores, while Layer 1 yielded peculiar microcores which resemble prismatic and even cylindrical pieces. Sidescrapers are one of the main classes of tools, mostly convex longitu dinal and transversal, oval scrapers with peripheral trimming, and inverse scrap ers. Scraper-knives, double, dejete, bifacial (similar to bifacial foliates) tools are rarer. In the upper layers, these types were supplemented by convergent and alternate scrapers. Endscrapers are equally important and are represented by short and very short tools on flakes, double, rounded scrapers, and microscrapers; endscrapers on bladelets are rare. The lower layers yielded tanged pieces as well as end scrapers with inverse retouching of the working edges, while the upper layers are characterized by tools of teardrop shape. Splintered pieces have one to four working edges of various proportions; many of them have lateral retouch, and microlithic chisel-like tools were found. Broad and completely bifacial tools occurred in Layers 2-4 and are typical of Maina. Other tool classes include retouched flakes, notches, denticulates, choppers, composite tools, rare burins, Mousterian-like points, retouched blades and bladelets (some with rounded ogi val tips), micropoints, shouldered borers, and backed bladelets (numerous in</page><page sequence="28">364 VasiPev Layer 1). Rare finds are percutors, thin bifacial discoidal tools, and limaces. Through time, there is a gradual increase in the frequencies of notched and denticulated pieces accompanied by a decrease in splintered pieces and side scrapers. The tool-kit also becomes more diverse. The excavations revealed a rich series of antler and bone items, including points with one or two grooves, various points without grooves, smoothers, unusual bone fasteners with large heads, antler hammers, antler handles, bone needles, bone rods, pendants and a small incised pebble. Layer 5 yielded a unique anthropomorphic figurine made of baked clay, which is the first art object known from the Yenisei Paleolithic. The material from the site reflects the development of a single cultural tradition (Fig. 5), which can be divided into a number of stages. The assem blages from the earliest occupations (Layers 6-9, V, G) are small. The collection from Layer 5 has many features in common with that of Layer B in the western part of the site, and the two are close to each other in age (16,000-15,000 B.P.). The industry from Layers 2-4 is quite homogeneous (14,000-12,000 B.P.), but Fig. 5. Developmental scheme for the stone, bone, and antler industries of the Afontova culture in the Upper Yenisei area, based on data from the stratified site of Maina.</page><page sequence="29">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 365 there is a divergence during the succeeding period (12,000-10,000 B.P.): one variant is represented by the assemblage of Layer 1 and the other by Layers A-l to A-3. Comparison of Maina with sites of the Afontova culture shows a parallel development of culture in the Middle and Upper Yenisei areas. The industry of Layers 2-4 of Maina (and of the lower layers of Kantegir) has many resemblances to Kokorevo II and IVA, while the assemblages of Layers A-l to A-3 look more like Kokorevo III. Opposite Maina, on the other side of the mouth of the River Ui, is the important stratified site of Ui II, which is currently under study (Vasil'ev, 1989). The stratigraphy indicates that Ui II was actually a part of Maina but has now been cut off from it by the river. The cultural layers are in sediments of the second terrace and can be correlated with the eastern part of Maina. The gen eralized cross section begins with the covering strata, which contain many cul tural horizons (Neolithic to Iron Age) and overlie laminated alluvial sands with traces of up to five soils and cryogenic disturbance (13 levels were identified). The hydrogeological conditions at the site have permitted a very complete and informative section of the second terrace, which also differs from the more usual version. The alluvial beds contain eight Paleolithic layers (2-3, 3a, and 4-8). The faunal assemblages include red deer, aurochs, wild goat, argali, Asiatic wild ass, and hare. The habitation structures are of particular interest. Layer 2 revealed a domestic unit, where finely made tools and cores lay on the surface of flat stones surrounding a hearth. There were two habitation structures in Layer 7. The first hut, measuring 4 x 2 m, was slab-lined, with two hearths in the center and near the entrance and an obvious outside activity area near the entrance. Nearby was a small slab-lined construction, which looked like a stone ring (1.2 m in diameter) and may be the remains of a light shelter. The stone, bone, and antler artifacts are analogous to those of Maina but there are also large wedge-shaped cores, a subtriangular slate pendant, and cylindrical and rectangular beads. Layer 2 yielded anvils and a grinding stone. A very similar cultural development is evident at Kantegir, the other Paleo lithic locality in the same area (Astakhov, 1986a). The cultural layers occurred in two areas of the second (12- to 14-m) terrace, separated by a small ravine. Layer 1 was in the upper strata within the buried soil; Layers 2-5 were at a depth of 1.2-2.7 m in periglacial alluvial sands. Among the faunal remains, Siberian wild goat dominated and was associated with aurochs, roe deer, and fish. The site contained many hearths and chipped stone concentrations. The lithic industry is characterized by flake technology (60-80% of tools were made on flakes). Cores are mainly single- or double-platform, unifacial, and discoidal; the cores from Layer 5 bear traces of radial preparation of their backs. The microblade technology was very important and the site yielded butt ended and typical wedge-shaped pieces. Scrapers were the dominant tools,</page><page sequence="30">366 VasiPev including endscrapers on flakes, scrapers with lateral retouch, shouldered, den ticulated, double endscrapers, and scrapers with concave base. Sidescrapers were mostly convex and straight longitudinal, but there were also bifacial, half moon-shaped, double, transversal, convergent, and dejete forms. Notches, den ticulates, choppers, chisel-like and composite tools, and atypical borers occurred, as did flat unifacial foliate points. Rare tool types included retouched blades and bladelets, micropoints, burins, hafted knife, and bifacial pieces. Finally, the site yielded antler points with one or two grooves, points without grooves, bone smoothers, awls, and needles. The site of Dzhoi (Astakhov and Vasil'ev, 1981) yielded a collection very similar to the lower horizons of Kantegir. The artifacts were redeposited in sandy loams of the slope of the second terrace. There are single-platform, wedge shaped, and butt-ended cores. Sidescrapers make up the majority of the tools and are double convex longitudinal, longitudinal, or transversal, oval scrapers with peripheral trimming, and so forth. The endscrapers are subtriangular and all are on flakes. An elongated, unifacial, willow-leaf point is of special interest. Notches, burins, retouched flakes (including raclette-Mke, pieces), and small asymmetrical points also occurred. Other localities of the Afontova culture in the West Sayan area include such occurrences as Maininskii Lesozavod (Vasil'ev, 1987) and Sizaya VIII (Astakhov, 1986a). At the latter site, the cultural layers were in the upper part of the second terrace. The southernmost stratified site in the Yenisei Basin, Nizhnii Idzhir I (Astakhov, 1986a), is some distance away from the other sites, in the valley of River Us. The site is a single occupation in the alluvial deposits of the 20-m terrace; it has a radiocarbon date of 17,220 B.P. ? 140 years (LE-1984). All the bones are of Siberian wild goat and the site may be interpreted as a hunting station. The functional peculiarities of this specialized occurrence affect the character of the tool-kit. The finds consisted of a nucleiform burin, rather like a multifaceted dihedral burin (Idzhir-type), a handful of bladelets struck from it, a blade-knife, a burin, microbladelets, a sidescraper, and a bone needle. Abramova (1979b) has observed that another cultural tradition, the Koko revo culture, existed in the Middle Yenisei valley alongside the Afontova cul ture, but slightly more recent. The main features of the Kokorevo culture include a highly developed blade technology, based on large, elongated cores (some almost prismatic). Retouched blades, burins, Mousterian-like points, and end scrapers on blades (but not microlithic forms) are common. Splintered pieces are less important and, again, are not microlithic. The sidescrapers include pieces made on cores but bifacial forms are absent, as are retouched micro bladelets. The antler points usually have a flattened cross section; there are also flat dagger-like tools with insets and needle-like points. An additional marker for the Kokorevo culture are the distinctive hearths, surrounded by the slabs forming stone rosettes.</page><page sequence="31">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 367 The key locality for this tradition is the stratified site of Kokorevo I. The cultural layers (named 1-4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, and 6a) were in the alluvial sandy loams of the second (12-m) terrace at a depth of 2.4-4.7 m. Reindeer and hare make up an overwhelming majority of the mammalian fauna; there were also horse, argali, aurochs, wolf, ass, roe deer, Asiatic wild ass, red deer, polar fox, wolf or dog (in Layer 3), various rodents, and birds. Layer 4 yielded fragments of mammoth tusk. The site has a noteworthy series of radiocarbon dates. Layer 2: 12,940 B.P. ? 270 years (LE-526) 13,100 B.P. ? 500 years (IGAN-103) 15,200 B.P. ? 200 years (IGAN-105) Layer 3: 13,000 B.P. ? 500 years (IGAN-102) 13,330 B.P. ? 50 years (GIN-91) 14,450 B.P. ? 150 years (LE-628) 15,900 B.P. ? 250 years (IGAN-104) The site seems to have been occupied within the period 15,000-13,000 B.P. The excavations revealed numerous hearths (including the Kokorevo type) and lithic workshops. The investigator (Abramova, 1979b) of the site believes that a 3 x 6-m, oval lens of cultural debris with hearths in Layer 2 may be interpreted as a dwelling. Grechkina (1984) has suggested that there may be a habitation structure in Layer 4 as well. The stone industry from all layers is similar (Fig. 6). It is based on large, wide blades (38.5% of the tools are made on blades and bladelets) and flakes struck from elongated, single- and double-platform cores. Multiple-platform, cubic, butt-ended, heavy wedge-shaped, and discoidal cores are rare. The con tinued removal of blades sometimes led to the formation of prismatic-like cores. The microblade technology was also well developed, and wedge-shaped and butt-ended microcores are numerous. Celt-like and burin-like cores also occur. Sidescrapers were made on blades and flakes as well as on lithic debris, primary flakes and blades, pebbles, and exhausted cores. The main types of scrapers are longitudinal convex and concave, double, triple, transversal, dejete, convergent, alternate, and inverse; scrapers with peripheral trimming are worthy of note (and there is some trimming of transversal tool edges). There are rela tively high frequencies of blades retouched along one or both margins, blades with alternate retouch, with inverse retouch, with trimming of the distal end, with trimmed tips and retouched edges, and so on. Some of the pieces from Layer 4 with two retouched edges and rounded tips form a series which is transitional to Mousterian-like points; the latter are not common and include</page><page sequence="32">368 VasiFev Fig. 6. Stone bone, and antler artifacts from Kokorevo I (Kokorevo culture* i i w m ,</page><page sequence="33">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 369 wide examples resembling convergent scrapers. Elongated points also occurred. Some points have traces of basal inverse trimming. Endscrapers are mostly made on blades, retouched blades, blade fragments, and flakes (short and very short). There are endscrapers with small notches on the corners of the working edge, rounded, double, asymmetrical, dejete, denticulated, carinated scrapers, and microlithic scrapers. Burins form a noteworthy series (dihedral, dihedral angle, angle, lateral on straight, oblique and concave truncations, double); most are made on blades. The pebble tools include choppers with straight, convex, and concave edges and pick-like implements. The finely made borers have short asymmetrical tips. Retouched flakes and chisel-like tools are rare. Small points, denticulated tools (including denticulated sidescrapers), notches, bees, and a small triangular handax are also reported. The various layers of the site yielded several antler and bone pieces. Pecu liar flattened oval and plano-convex sectioned points with grooves were found, as well as flat wide points (called "daggers") and points without grooves. Layer 3 yielded a slotted tool with stone bladelets still inset in the slot; the same assemblage contained an aurochs scapula pierced by an antler point. Other tools included needle-like points, large dagger-like pieces, antler mattocks, fragments of batons de commandement, pieces with triangular trimmed tips, rods, awls, and needles. Ornaments are represented by beads made of small flat pebbles, pendants, and spiral bone objects. According to Abramova (1979b), Kokorevo IV (Astakhov, 1966d) can also be assigned to the Kokorevo culture. This site is located at the ravine, which cuts the second (10- to 12-m) terrace. Layer 1 was in the upper sandy loams, and Layer 2 in the underlying sands. Faunal remains include reindeer (domi nant), aurochs, red deer, hare, wolf or dog, and so forth. The lower layer has radiocarbon dates of 14,320 B.P. ? 330 years (LE-469) and 15,460 ? 120 (LE-540); this layer contained a Kokorevo-type hearth. The stone and bone industry lack the traits characteristic of the Kokorevo culture. Astakhov (1966d) mentioned several analogies to the Afontova Gora III assemblages. Single-platform pebble cores, wedge-shaped microcores, and butt-ended cores occurred; sidescrapers are longitudinal convex, double, and convergent; there were endscrapers on elongated flakes, choppers, shouldered borers, and dihedral burins, as well as a flattened, grooved antler point, a small bone point, and a bone awl with a head. The association of an Afontova culture like stone industry with a Kokorevo-type hearth is very curious. Novoselovo VI and VII are younger (Abramova, 1979b). At Novoselovo VI, the cultural layer was at a depth of 1.0-1.3 m in the upper sandy loams of the 23- to 26-m terrace-like level. The overwhelming majority of the fauna was reindeer; aurochs, wolf, Polar fox, glutton, red deer, and hare also occurred. The cultural layer yielded a Kokorevo-type hearth, lithic workshops, and the mandible of a woman (identified by G. F. Debetz). There is a radiocarbon date of 11,600 B.P. ? 500 years (GIN-403).</page><page sequence="34">370 VasiPev The cores are single-platform, double-platform, flat, cubic, heavy wedge shaped, and discoidal cores and wedge-shaped microcores. Retouched and arch backed blades are clearly dominant. Sidescrapers (convex longitudinal, oval with peripheral trimming, convergent, alternate, and a noteworthy core-scraper) are slightly less important. Endscrapers on flakes and blades are of various forms, including carinated, rounded tools and pieces with ventral trimming, with lateral retouch, and so on. Foliate and subtriangular Mousterian-like points, small points, burins, retouched flakes, choppers, denticulates, and adzes were found, as were an antler fragment with clear traces of working, a broken flat inset dagger, needle-like points, bone needles, and stone beads. Novoselovo VII is in a similar stratigraphic position but in a higher terrace (30-35 m). Mammalian fauna is represented by reindeer (dominant), horse, saiga, aurochs, wolf, polar fox, hare, and marmot. The radiocarbon date of 15,000 B.P. ? 300 years (GIN-402) is regarded by Abramova (1979b) as too old. The site yielded huge butt-ended, prismatic, and flat single-platform cores, wedge-shaped microcores, burin-like cores, and butt-ended microcores. The tools are quite similar to those of Novoselovo VI: large retouched blades, di hedral, angle, and lateral burins, endscrapers on blades and flakes, borers, splin tered pieces, sidescrapers, choppers, etc. There was a noteworthy series of elongated points, some with inverse basal trimming, and a fragment of an antler tool and a bone pipe are reported. Aeshka I (Abramova, 1969) is dated to the Final Pleistocene. The two cultural layers lay directly beneath the modern soil in the second terrace. The blade industry is similar to Kokorevo I: elongated blade cores, retouched blades, Mousterian-like points, small points, and so on. Chegerak (Lisitsyin, 1983b) may also be assigned to the Kokorevo culture. It was in the top part of the upper loams of the high terrace. Bones of roe deer were accompanied by single- and double-platform cores (including elongated forms), prismatic cores, and wedge-shaped and butt-ended, elongated and medium-sized microcores. The tools are retouched blades, endscrapers on flakes and blades, asymmetrical borers, burins, choppers, and denticulates. Stratigraphically, Aeshka III (Lisitsyin, 1987b) is close to Chegerak. Among the artifacts are single-, double-, and three-platform cores, butt-ended micro cores, sidescrapers, endscrapers on blades, small points, retouched flakes, and a fragment of a Mousterian-like point. The collection from Krutogorskoe I (Lisitsyin, 1980b) consists of single platform elongated cores, wedge-shaped microcores, sidescrapers, endscrapers on flakes, foliate points, retouched blades, and so on. At Pervomaiskoe I (Lisitsyin, 1980a, 1986a), the artifacts occurred in the upper sandy loams of the fifth terrace at a depth of 1.2 m. They include single-, double-platform, butt-ended, and large wedge-shaped cores, a noteworthy series</page><page sequence="35">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 371 of burins made on fragments of retouched blades and points, small points, endscrapers, and retouched blades. Podgornoe Lake (Lisitsyin, 1980a), at a depth of &gt;2 m in the sandy and clay beds of the fifth terrace, yielded single- and double-platform cores, bifacial discoidal cores, and many microcores (celt-like, conical, and wedge-shaped). The tool-kit includes convex transversal and longitudinal sidescrapers, scraper knives on elongated flakes, endscrapers on flakes, and atypical points on blades. Numerous surface localities are known near the village of Novoselovo, of which Cheremushka may also be assigned to the Kokorevo culture (Abramova, 1971). Lisitsyin (1986b) has added to the roster of the Kokorevo culture the assem blages from the two upper layers of Novoselovo XIII (mentioned above). Rein deer was the predominant animal, associated with aurochs, argali, and Asiatic wild ass. Geologically, the upper layer is roughly contemporaneous with Novo selovo VII. The lower layer yielded elongated single-platform cores, which are characteristic of the Kokorevo culture, and double-platform types. Among the tools, the backed bladelets include pieces with bilateral backing, with alternate backing, with lateral backing and rounded tip, and with retouched edge and a burin-blow. There were also blades with ogival tips, retouched blades, splintered pieces, endscrapers, and an antler tool. The collection from the upper layer is larger and includes unusual elongated prismatic-like cores, flat double-platform, discoidal, butt-ended, and large wedge-shaped cores, typical wedge-shaped microcores, butt-ended and double platform microcores, and several small prismatic and flat single-platform cores. Retouched blades, abruptly retouched blades, points with rounded tips, and foliate and elongated Mousterian-like points constitute the heart of the tool-kit. There are also finely made burins on blades (lateral, angle dihedral, transversal, oblique, and double), sidescrapers (simple convex longitudinal, and bifacial), many endscrapers on bladelets and flakes, dihedral points on bladelets, angle borers, notched and composite tools, and atypical chisel-like tools. The bone tools are a small broken awl, a flat point without grooves, and a rib with traces of working. According to Abramova (1964), Druzhinikha, the northernmost site in the Yenisei valley, also belongs to the Kokorevo culture. The artifacts were asso ciated with the loess-like sandy loams, which form the upper part of the second terrace. Reindeer, horse and mammoth were identified. Tseitlin (1979) regarded the locality as belonging to the terminal Sartan, but Abramova believes that it could be older. Flat single-platform, discoidal and prismatic cores, foliate points, convergent sidescrapers, retouched blades, and endscrapers on flakes are reported. Podsukhanikha, on the right bank of the Yenisei, is set apart from the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures by the peculiarities of its lithics (Abramova,</page><page sequence="36">372 VasiFev 1975a). The site yielded a noteworthy series of wedge-shaped and butt-ended microcores (mainly subrectangular in plan) and burin-like cores. There were also sidescrapers (convex longitudinal, concave transversal, dejete, bifacial, and pebble scrapers), endscrapers on bladelets and flakes, arch-backed blades, splin tered pieces, notches, denticulates, choppers, foliate points, and borers. Sites which produce lithic assemblages showing a mixture of traits of the two cultures are of special interest. In this respect, the data obtained during the excavation of Berezovyii Ruchei I are very important for the problem of the relationship of the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures (Vishnyatsky et al., 1986; Vishnyatsky, 1987). The site is outside the Yenisei basin, on the bank of the River Beresh. The artifacts occurred in the upper loams of a terrace which corresponds to the third terrace of the Chulyim river system. Faunal remains are of aurochs, reindeer, horse, wolf, polar fox, or fox. The investigators of the site assigned it to the Final Pleistocene (12,000-11,000 B.P.). Cores are represented by single-platform pebble cores, a series of butt ended microcores (Fig. 7), and prismatic and conical cores. Among the tools, sidescrapers predominate (convex longitudinal, double, convergent, inverse) and are made on flakes, flake-blades, and blades. The endscrapers include pieces on retouched blades, triangular types on retouched flakes, and nosed carinated scrapers. Other tool types are retouched blades and flakes, dihedral and angle burins, atypical elongated Mousterian-like points, atypical limaces, rare splin tered pieces, and pebble tools. In addition, there were two flat inset antler tools similar to the daggers from Kokorevo I. This industry is similar to the Afontova culture in most respects, but the occurrence of large endscrapers on blades and retouched bladelets indicates the influence of the Kokorevo culture. The development of the Afontova culture in the Upper Yenisei area was interrupted by the intrusion of a sharply different bladelet industry, as shown by the assemblage from Layer 3 of Golubaya I (Astakhov, 1986a). The site is on the second terrace, and cultural horizons 1-3 were in the laminated alluvial sands and sandy loams at a depth of 2-4 m. The faunal assemblage of Layer 3 is characterized by red deer, Asiatic wild ass, aurochs, hare, and birds. Layer 3 has the following radiocarbon dates. 12,900 B.P. + 150 years (LE-llOlb) 12,980 B.P. ? 140 years (LE-llOlv) 13,050 B.P. ? 90 years (LE-llOla) 13,650 B.P. ? 180 years (LE-llOlg) These seem to correspond well to the geological position of the site. A house with a slab-lined hearth was discovered, which Astakhov sees as having been a light aboveground dwelling. The stone industry is characterized by blade technology (65% of the tools are made on blades and bladelets). Only small exhausted cores were recovered,</page><page sequence="37">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 373 resembling multifaceted dihedral and angle burins; butt-ended and flat cores were also found. There are many retouched blades, including pieces with one, two, or three retouched edges, peripheral retouch, inverse retouch, and so on. Endscrapers on blades, retouched blades, and blades with lateral notches are noteworthy; endscrapers on flakes are represented by short, nosed, shouldered, or double types or with lateral notches or concave bases. The microliths are backed bladelets and micropoints. There are rare burins (angle, angle dihedral, and lateral), borers, bees, retouched flakes, notches, denticulates, atypical Mousterian-like points, and pebble tools. Sidescrapers are rare and chisel-like tools are absent. The various composite tools (endscraper-focs, endscraper</page><page sequence="38">374 Vasil'ev points, burin-becs, etc.) are of particular interest. There was also a broken ivory point. In spite of clear typological differences, this industry seems to have roots in the middle stage of the Late Paleolithic, although some pieces show strong parallels to the Kokorevo culture (Vasil'ev, 1988b). DISCUSSION I now consider the problem of Late Paleolithic cultural development in the Yenisei area. For the sake of brevity, I omit the older schemes worked out by Savenkov, Merhart, and Gromov. The geological framework proposed by Gro mov was the basis for the model put forward by Sosnovsky (1934), who approached the Yenisei evidence from the point of view of stadial evolution, which was dominant in Russian Paleolithic archaeology for a long time. He distinguished three stages of the Late Paleolithic as local developments of a single cultural tradition. His early group, which was, in turn, subdivided into two phases, consisted of the lower layer of Afontova Gora II, Afontova Gora III, Kokorevo II, Bugach, Voennyii Gorodok, and others. Kokorevo I and IV, Layer C of Biriusa, Pereselencheskii Punkt, Aeshka, and other sites were assigned to the middle phase, while the late phase included the upper layer of Afontova Gora II, Afontova Gora IV, Layer B of Biriusa, and Kokorevo III. There was a change in the methodological approach of Russian Paleolithic archaeology in the late 1950s and 1960s, associated with the adoption of Rogach ev's (1957) concept of the local development of Paleolithic culture. This led to a different approach to the Yenisei Paleolithic. Abramova (1972) suggested the coexistence of two cultures, the Afontova and the Kokorevo. This proposition, which was sharply different from the ideas of Sosnovsky and Okladnikov, is succinctly outlined in the following statement: "Stone and bone inventory is a marker of the cultural identity of the site rather than chronological succession" (Abramova, 1972, p. 255). Abramova believed that the differences between cultures reflected their origins. She believed that the roots of the blade com ponent of the Kokorevo culture should be sought in the Levallois-Mousterian (the Altai sites, particularly Ust' Kanskaya Cave) and that Malaya Syiya might be a transitional stage in this sequence. The roots of the Afontova culture were thought to lead back through the Mongolian lowlands (Abramova, 1984b). Both cultures were a part of the Southern Siberian culture area, which included sites scattered through the Altai, Yenisei, and Trans-Baikal areas. She tried to explain the features common to the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures either by the nature of their origins or by interaction between them during their development. Astak hov (1986a) has also noted the common roots of the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures and regards them as a cultural variants rather than as separate cultures. It would be best to avoid the extremes of both the stadial and the local</page><page sequence="39">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 375 culture approaches to the Paleolithic. Stadial and local phenomena may be regarded as complementary, not mutually exclusive, aspects of the process of cultural development, like two sides of a coin. Detailed, comparative, typo logical analysis of the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures shows that many of the criticisms made by Okladnikov (1981) have validity. First, the differences between the two cultures are restricted mostly to technology and to relative frequencies of tool classes. The latter can fluctuate markedly between functionally different areas of a single cultural layer or between successive horizons of a site belonging to a single culture tradition (presumably reflecting the chance excavation of functionally different parts of the site), so this index is not useful for cultural identification. The technological difference is obvious. The Kokorevo culture is charac terized by the predominance of large, mainly elongated, single- and double platform blade cores. Many pieces bear traces of radial preparation of the strik ing platforms (although this attribute can also be seen in some assemblages of the Afontova culture). Sometimes the cores strongly resemble prismatic cores, but the technology is very different from a true prismatic one. This technology further affected the tool-kits, in that there are high proportions of retouched blades and elongated Mousterian-like points in the Kokorevo culture. The micro cores are similar in both cultures, although the Kokorevo culture lacks elongated pieces on retouched bladelets and pencil-shaped cores. If we ignore the frequencies, then we may compare the Afontova and Kokorevo cultures on a more sophisticated typological level. In spite of an apparent quantitative difference, all the morphological types of retouched blades found at Kokorevo I are present in some sites of the Afontova culture. The most striking contrast is in the group of microblade tools, but this contrast is essentially between the Afontova Gora assemblages and all other Yenisei sites. Afontova Gora II and III yielded highly distinctive bladelets with trimming of straight or oblique transversal edges or with retouch along the longitudinal and transversal edges. Backed bladelets (uni- or bilateral) are pres ent in both the Afontova and the Kokorevo cultures (where they are found in Layers 2, 5, and 6 of Kokorevo I and as a noteworthy series in Layer 2 of Novoselovo XIII). The burins differ in relative frequencies but are represented mainly by the same types. Oblique transversal burins are peculiar to the Kokorevo II assem blage. In the Kokorevo culture, burins are usually illustrated by pieces on blades with elongated tips, but such tools are found only in Layer 4 of Kokorevo I and Layer 1 of Novoselovo XIII; they are absent from all other assemblages of this culture. The lithics of Kokorevo I and II are identical in the typology of Mousterian like points; in both groups, there are elongated, wide, thick, subtriangular pieces and points with slightly rounded ogival tips. Kokorevo culture assemblages lack</page><page sequence="40">376 Vasil'ev the bifacial foliate points, which occur in the Afontova Gora assemblages, but the same is true of most sites of the Afontova culture. In the Afontova culture, the splintered pieces are characteristically small, subtriangular "chisels" with a single working edge, but these do not occur in all assemblages. The same is true of the other varieties of pieces ecaillees: the wide flattened types, the elongated double types, and the microlithic pieces. The Afontova culture is characterized by retouching of the lateral edges of chisel-like tools, but this technique is also seen in the collection from Layer 5 of Kokorevo I. Among the endscrapers, there is no single type from Kokorevo I which cannot be found in assemblages of the Afontova culture, where endscrapers show greater diversity and include many types which are unknown in the Koko revo culture: ogival pieces, tanged pieces, scrapers with a concave base, and microscrapers. However, the variability of endscrapers is no less pronounced within the Afontova culture itself. The overwhelming majority of sidescrapers are identical in both groups, but the Kokorevo I assemblages lack the forms typical of the Afontova culture [concave transversal, double concavo-convex, carinated, bifacial (but the last occur in Layer 1 of Novoselovo XIII)]. Even the Kokorevo culture's peculiar scrapers on cores are known in the Afontova culture (Kokorevo IVA and Maina). Among the retouched flakes, the Afontova culture is marked by the pres ence of pieces with bifacial retouch, with two perpendicular retouched edges, and with retouched truncations and of tools resembling raclettes. The varieties of pebble tools are mostly the same, but only in the Afontova culture are there tools with two working edges on opposite ends of the pebble, and only the Kokorevo culture has ax-like unifaces. The Afontova and Kokorevo cultures do not differ in borers, bees, notches, and denticulates. The distributions of these tool types seem to be independent of broad cultural groupings, and the problem is aggravated by Abramova's failure to identify denticulates and notches as separate classes. However, examination of the collections shows that such tools are present in every Yenisei Paleolithic assemblage above a certain size. It is difficult to compare bone and antler tools because of their rarity and peculiarity. Antler points with a rounded to oval cross section are more char acteristic of the Afontova culture, while those of the Kokorevo culture have flattened cross sections. Other attributes of the Afontova culture include grooves near the tips of the points and oblique bases. The Final Paleolithic of Yenisei is, thus, quite complex. The Kokorevo culture seems to be a relatively cohesive entity while the Afontova culture is more variable. Whenever assemblages are grouped on the basis of some of the tool types, these groupings are cross-cut by configurations based on other attri butes. Also, many of the traits have spatial rather than cultural significance. For instance, heavy-duty tools (ax-like and adze-like forms) are widely distributed</page><page sequence="41">The Late Paleolithic of the Yenisei 377 in the Middle Yenisei but absent in the Upper Yenisei. Overall, the degree of similarity between the Afontova and the Kokorevo cultures supports the prop osition that these are variations within a single cultural tradition rather than separate cultures. As I have observed elsewhere (Vasil'ev, 1988b), the Afontova culture has a very broad network of cultural affinities beyond the boundaries of the Yenisei basin. Consequently, it cannot be regarded as a purely local phenomenon but, rather, as a part of an entity of enormous spatial extent. Assemblages analogous to the Afontova culture are well-known in the Ob' basin (Mogochino I), the Altai area (Srostki), the Angara basin (the Badai site cluster, including Fed yaevo), and the Trans-Baikal region (Oshurkovo). Obviously, such assemblages, which are separated by thousands of kilometers, are not identical, but the sim ilarities between them are clear. It should be noted that the Kokorevo culture also has many analogies outside the Yenisei basin, but these lie only to the west, on the Tom' river (Shumikha) and in the Upper Irtyish area (Shul'binka). It therefore seems appropriate to return to the concept of a single Final Paleolithic "Yenisei" culture, divided into a number of variants with interme diate industries. Presumably, more detailed analysis of the available data would increase the number of such variants known. This approach brings us essentially back to Astakhov's (1966a) model. There is no cause for surprise in the fact, observed by Z. A. Abramova, of quan titative differences in stone industries between individual occupations in the Yenisei, particularly considering the general sociocultural pattern of life of prehistoric people at this time. They probably lived in small bands, like some kind of "atom." Each band would have its own peculiarities, reflected in the characteristics of technology, tool types, and dwelling construction. Small bands of this kind coexisted for centuries and millennia, replaced each other at the same sites, interacted, mixed, interrelated, joined together or separated. All the lithic assemblages, which are qualitatively very similar, are quantitatively dissimilar, so that what we see is a complex, mosaic-like picture, very different from that in later prehistoric periods. (Okladnikov, 1981, p. 113) CONCLUSION This review of the main Paleolithic sites in the Yenisei area permits us to construct a tentative chronological framework (Fig. 8). We should not overes timate the precision with which these sites are dated. The early part of the sequence, between the Levallois-Mousterian of Dvuglazka Shelter (correspond ing to one of the interstadials of the Muruktin glaciation) and the Early Sartan industries, is represented by only one site, Malaya Syiya, which dates to the Karginsk period, approximately 34,000-33,000 B.P. The problematical assem blage from Kurtak IV is younger (24,000-23,000 B.P.). The next phase of the Yenisei Paleolithic is marked by the Early Sartan bladelet industries (24,000 18,000 B.P.) of Shlenka, Tarachikha, Ui I, and other sites. These were followed by the Final Paleolithic (18,000/16,000-10,000 B.P.), which consists of indus</page><page sequence="42">378 VasiPev V X2 D ftJaeodimatic Years ar stages r-35,000 30,000 f-25,000 20,000 iaooo hM,000 1-13,000 1-12.000 h 11,000 40000 I'5 It 1' 51 9&gt; * ? q5 I' ?.0 2;ar 5T = 2. &lt; 3 3 a u&gt; w Ji 1 = I o CP c 2 S: 2 |, 5 &lt; Hp.
