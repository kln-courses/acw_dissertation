Seattle, New York: University of Washington Press, American Museum of Natural History, 1990. 271 pp. In 1907 King Leopold of Belgium donated three thousand ethnographic objects from the Congo to the American Museum of Natural History. The negotiations leading to this gift and the opening of an exhibition featuring the Congo consolidated the good relations between Leopold and the museum. Partly as a result of this privileged rela- tionship with the Belgian king, the museum was able to organize a major Congo expe- dition in the years following. Thus in 1909 mammalogist, Herbert Lang, and ornithol- ogist, James P. Chapin, were sent to the northeastern Congo to collect mammals, birds, and material objects for the museum's departments. The expedition, which was initially planned as a two year project, eventually grew into a far more important undertaking, remarkable for its breadth. Over a period of six years the two zoologists collected some fifty-four tons of material, including four thousand ethnographic objects and nine thousand photographs. Amazingly, seventy long years passed before this expedition's rich ethnographic material was exhibited and published. African Reflections is the companion volume to the 1990 American Museum of Natural History exhibition of art in northeastern Zaire. Although the core of the exhibition is the Lang/Chapin ethnographic collection, it also includes many objects from other private and public collections, which make it the most complete exhibition of northeastern Zairean art to date. A splendid book, African Reflections is far more than an ordinary catalogue. In eight well-documented and beautifully illustated chapters - which include sections on politics, household organization, worldview, trade, tribute, and ritual - Enid Schild- krout and Curtis A. Keim trace the fascinating history of the art of northeastern Zaire, and more particularly of the Mangbetu and neighbouring peoples, such as the Azanda. In other chapters, J. Vansina presents a reconstruction of the area's historical evolu- tion, D. Demolin and T.R. Miller analyze Mangbetu music and dance, while J. Mack interprets Azande art and culture and its relations with the Mangbetu complex. Taken together, the chapters demonstrate a desire for contextualization. The art objects are situated within their sociocultural, political, economic, cosmological, ethnic, and geographical context. Therefore, the book offers a fascinating and impressive fresco</page><page sequence="2">364 CJAS / RCEA 28:2 1994 of a particularly turbulent and complex moment in the history of northeastern Zaire. Schildkrout and Keim cover the last 12o years, beginning with George Schwein- furth's first encounter with Mangbetu King Mbunza in I870. Besides drawing on many of the early accounts of the Mangbetu and Lang's rich field notes, they also rely on con- temporary research. Their stress throughout is on contextualization. By demonstrat- ing links to both past and present, Schildkrout and Keim convey the importance of analyzing the historical processes of change in order to understand the art in question. Instead of viewing the works of art statically within the frame of an ethnographic present (i.e. that of Lang's time), they show that the much admired art forms (carvings, mural painting, music, dress, hair style) of the Mangbetu and neighbouring peoples around the turn of the century represent a cultural moment which cannot be fully appreciated outside the context of its own time. During this period various African cultures and art traditions in the region, such as the Mangbetu, Azande, Barambo, and Bua, were interacting and communicating with one another and with the intruding Europeans. Specifically, Schildkrout and Keim consistently argue that the anthropomorphic scripture, which is commonly considered to be typical of the Mangbetu artistic vocab- ulary, developed around the turn of the century out of preexisting art traditions found among neighbouring peoples. Second, they demonstrate how the rise of the Azande and Mangbetu kingdoms in the second half of the nineteenth century led to the promi- nence of certain art styles. Furthermore, Schildkrout and Keim assert that the repre- sentational, anthropomorphic Mangbetu art of this period - and its disappearance after 1915 - can only be explained in the historical context of the colonial encounter. Their arguments take us beyond ethnic typologies and lead to the book's dominant question: who, in fact, created Mangbetu art, and why? With respect to this question, the book offers as much a critical ethnography of western colonialism and its changing relations with other societies as it considers the question of Mangbetu identity. Although Schildkrout and Keim make no references to the "Writing Culture" move- ment, its influence (and, in particular, that of Clifford's The Predicament of Culture) is obvious here. Both the exhibition and the book present the dynamics of the cultural interaction and confrontation that took place between Africans and outsiders as a pro- cess of translation and transplanting. The book's title, African Reflections, clearly refers to this process. On the one hand are the Europeans' reflections of both the Azande and Mangbetu. The former made exaggerated descriptions of African court life, cannibalism, social practices, and artis- tic achievement, which later developed into a powerful, ambivalent, and Eurocentric myth of the Mangbetu. Even as late as 27 March 1932, M. Leiris wrote in his diary, "premier contact avec les Mangbetou, anthropophages de legende." On the other hand are the Africans' reflections of the outsiders. Shortly after the first colonial contacts, northeastern Zaire witnessed the rise of an anthropomorphic form of art, a genre that was not intrinsic to the material culture of the Mangbetu and Azande in the precolo- nial period. According to the authors, in developing this new representational type of art, the Mangbetu were reacting to a growing European interest. Schildkrout and Keim convincingly argue that by reflecting images of themselves, Europeans, and the image that they perceived their new audience had of them, the Mangbetu were expressing their new sense of ethnic identity.</page><page sequence="3">365 Book Reviews / Comptes rendus Schildkrout and Keim's perception of the evolution of Mangbetu art is unique in its assessment of the role played by the collector and observer, Lang, in the history of Mangbetu art. The European presence undoubtedly greatly expanded the market for certain forms of regional art and encouraged the development and spread of certain new types of art labeled as "Mangbetu" art, regardless of its origin. Schildkrout and Keim estimate that some twenty thousand objects were carried away between 1898 and 1915. In the early colonial period Mangbetu rulers related to Europeans through the exchange of gifts, consisting for the most part of local objects of art. Royal patron- age of local artists even inspired changes in the arts, as they increasingly conformed to European tastes. People like Lang later directly commissioned art works from the local artists themselves. With the Belgian bureaucratization of colonial administration, gifts of art became less useful as a means of communicating with the colonial author- ites. As the power of kings declined, so the quantity and quality of anthropomorphic art decreased. Schildkrout and Keim both vividly and accurately describe this inter- play of otherness that gave rise to one of the richest periods in the art history of central Africa. Elegantly written, the text is accessible to the interested non-specialist as well. Scholars familiar with the art history of northeastern Zaire may sometimes find the text repetitious, yet the book remains a vital reference work. The inclusion of Lang's photographs alone merit the purchase of this book. Filip De Boeck Centre for Social and Cultural Anthropology University of Leuven</page></plain_text>
