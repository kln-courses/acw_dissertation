Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1983. 247 pages. $30.00. Reviewed by SUSAN VIDEEN Washington University How many students have regretfully turned the last page of their dog-eared Tale of Genji, marched into class, and demanded, "Well, what can I read after that?" And now we have one more good answer-Thomas Rohlich's translation and study of Hamamatsu Chu-nagon monogatari, a work of the same genre as Genji and written less than a century later. Of course a reading of Hamamatsu Chuinagon monogatari may serve only to set students to marveling anew at the psychological sophistication and narrative complexity of the earlier work. It is perhaps not surprising that Hamamatsu Chfina- gon monogatari, belonging to the same period and genre as Genji and a product of the same court society, has long been overlooked by scholars blinded by the brilliance of its near predecessor. And yet the work has an interest and a value of its own and should be studied along with other late-Heian works to see how Japanese narrative developed after Genji. Only recently have translations of such works begun to appear in English, notably Carol Hochstedler's translation of Yowa no nezame monogatari and Rosette F. Willig's translation of Torikaebaya monogatari, and Rohlich's work is a welcome addition to this grow- ing corpus.' In addition to the translation, the book includes an introduction of some fifty pages, a bibliography of works in both Japanese and English, and an index. The introduction contains the standard remarks on author, date, and textual history but quickly moves on to meatier topics: a discussion of the passage in Mumyozoshi criticizing Hamamatsu Chtinagon monogatari, a com- parison of the work with Genji monogatari, and an account of the use of dreams in the narrative. Hamamatsu Chfinagon monogatari was written after the middle of the eleventh century, some twenty-five to fifty years after the completion of Genji monogatari. Rohlich notes that the esteem in 1.

By the middle of the sixteenth century the first and last chapters of the work had disappeared, and though two copies of the last chapter were discovered in the 1930s, we still do not have the first chapter. Rohlich's translation of the five extant chapters is accompanied by a summary of the missing first chapter. The author of the work is unknown, although it has traditionally been attributed to the daugh- ter of Sugawara no Takasue, who wrote Sarashina nikki. The story told in Hamamatsu Chuinagon monogatari is a mar- velously convoluted fantasy. The hero, Chfinagon, learns that his dead father has been reborn as the son of the Chinese emperor, and, filial son that he is, he determines to go to China and see his father once more, if only in his present form as a seven-year-old Chinese prince. There he meets the boy's mother (his karmic grandmother?) and inevitably falls in love. This lady, the Hoyang Consort, is actually half Japanese, her Chinese father having seduced a lady during a brief sojourn in Japan, and she longs for her mother and half-sister, who still live in Japan. The ties binding Chfinagon to the Hoyang Consort are irresistible, and eventually they meet long enough to produce a son. When Chfinagon returns to Japan he takes the boy with him as a memento of their unforgettable love, and he searches out his lover's mother and half-sister and takes them under his wing. He despairs when the half-sister, his last tie with the woman he loves, is kidnapped by another man, but then he learns that the Hoyang Consort has died and will be reborn as the child already growing in her half-sister's womb. And so the story ends. We are left to hope that the baby is a girl. Hamamatsu Chfinagon monogatari is obviously not noteworthy for the realism of its plot and characterizations. And what is obvious to us was equally plain to discerning Japanese not long after the work was written. The author of Mumyozoshi, an early Kamakura critique of monogatari, criticizes Hamamatsu for being "unrealis- tic" in the jumbling together of things Chinese and Japanese and for being "nonsensical" in the way Chfinagon is apprised of the rebirth of the Hoyang Consort. Rohlich's translation and discussion of the pertinent passage in the Mumyo-zoshi are invaluable aids in under- standing what contemporary Japanese meant by realism and what they expected from monogatari. Of their sense of realism he writes: Its meaning is apparently quite different from any western sense of literary realism in a mimetic mode, and seems rather to exhibit a</page><page sequence="3">Review Section 221 concern for the presentation of events that are verifiable either by the experience of the reader or by his or her knowledge of truths based on firm religious beliefs. (p. 20) Japanese critical terms are as elusive as their English counter- parts, and though Rohlich's discussion at least calls our attention to the semantic problems, it never really clarifies the meaning of makoto shikarazu. Makoto refers less to the forms of external reality than to a sort of spiritual and emotional "inner truth," but since mimesis can never be divorced from the thoughts and feelings of the observer, one wonders whether in practice Western mimesis is significantly different from the realism that Rohlich describes, the presentation of events that are verifiable by the individual's experi- ence. Rohlich notes that "the reader must have accepted certain fictions as essential to the creation of a story-no one, after all, would believe these events actually occurred-but within that fiction certain facts known to be true to the reader must not be distorted or changed" (p. 22). It was all right for Chtinagon's father to be reborn in China, but it was unrealistic for his mother to be a half-breed Japanese. It was all right for Chtinagon to hear about the Hoyang Consort's death by supernatural means, but a dream was the pre- ferred mode of communication, not a voice from heaven. It was all right for the consort to be reborn in Japan, but her rebirth as her own half-sister's child was simply incredible-everyone knows that a soul must first pass a thousand years in the Trayastrimsa heaven. The author of Mumyazoashi described Hamamatsu as "a wonder- ful tale in which everything happens as we would expect it to" (p. 15). Clearly, contemporary readers wanted to see recognizable characters and plots in their monogatari, and Rohlich's analysis of the familiar motifs-the hidden identities, the "chance" meetings ordained by fate, the lady glimpsed through a crumbling wall, the vanished lover who cannot be forgotten-helps his readers to see how a work now disdained as derivative could once have been held in such high esteem. Shunzei and Teika's poetic dictum kotoba furuku kokoro atarashi ("old words new heart") seems to have applied equally well to stories, for what readers seemed to ap- preciate most was the familiar patterns. By the time of Mumyozoshi it was not so important that a work break new ground as that it remind one of the old classics, and one can scarcely turn a page of Hamamatsu Chfinagon monogatari without being reminded of Genji. The Hoyang Consort, like Kiri- tsubo in Genji, rises from obscurity to become the favorite of the</page><page sequence="4">222 Journal of Japanese Studies emperor only to be harassed by the other ladies at court, including the emperor's principal wife, whose rights as the daughter of a powerful minister must be respected. Like Genji, Chfinagon clan- destinely seduces the imperial consort, fathering a son whose iden- tity must be kept secret for the safety of both parents and child. Like Genji he discovers a memento of the consort he cannot have, a girl relative living in the mountain fastnesses. Like Genji he is asked to marry the emperor's daughter, an "honor" he regards as the most onerous of duties. Yet for all his similarities to Genji, Chfinagon is rather a prude and in the end seems most like the ineffectual Kaoru, who stands by indecisively while his lover is stolen away. Chtina- gon, too, holds back in his relations with the Consort's half-sister, partly for fear of her bad karma but also from reluctance to sully his love for the consort, and after she is gone his regrets echo those of Kaoru. Superficial similarities of character and plot aside, there are fundamental differences between Genji and Hamamatsu as well, and Rohlich does not neglect to point these out. Most important, perhaps, is the lack of character growth during the course of the story. Chuinagon starts as an opprobrious young-old man, and six years later, when the story ends, he seems very much the same. Genji, of course, follows the lifetime of its hero, whereas Hamamatsu is limited to six short years, during which one would expect to see less change. And yet the ladies, too, who emerge as distinct personalities in Genji, are flat and uninteresting in the later story. Rohlich argues unconvincingly the lack of political overtones in Hamamatsu in contrast to Genji. He notes in particular the shift in characters from the center of the court to the periphery of the power circle, Genji being the son of an emperor, whereas Chfinagon is only the son of a prince. But for all the political marriages and scheming in Genji, these are not the real heart of the work, and even Genji can hardly be described as a political novel. In any case, Rohlich fails to explain the significance of the alleged shift in focus. The most fascinating aspect of Hamamatsu Chknagon mono- gatari, and as Rohlich notes the one that distinguishes it most clearly from other monogatari, is the occurrence of dreams in the narrative. The confusion of the dream world with reality was a well-worked, indeed often too-much-worked, poetic conceit by the time of Hamamatsu Chknagon monogatari, but it seems to take on fresh meaning in this story. This effect is partially achieved through the exaggerated repetition of the word itself. When Chunagon learns the truth of his lover's identity, the whole affair "seemed no more</page><page sequence="5">Review Section 223 real than a dream within a dream" (p. 93). His meeting with her is continually referred to as "that spring night dream" from which he wakes to find the lady vanished. And, obsessed with the conflict between dream and reality, he is determined to meet her once more before returning to Japan: "It would be impossible to hurry back without first reconciling that spring night's dream with reality" (p. 95). Japan is no less dreamlike. Now the affair becomes a "vow pledged in a distant dream" with a woman far away in place, time, and social rank; and there is a strange blending of past, present, and future, of consort, mother, and half-sister in his relations with the people that matter to him at home. The dreams, eleven of them in all, leave a lingering fragrance as the story progresses, blending with the more prosaic sections into a swirl of half-seen images and pulsat- ing emotions. Quite suddenly Chuinagon's Japanese lover appears, as if out of nowhere, while he is in China, and only later do we learn that he is dreaming. In the end the distinction between dreaming and waking is no more clear for the reader than it is for the characters themselves. The prominence given to the eleven dreams destroys any sense of chronological progression in the narrative and creates a series of disconnected tableaux and flashbacks that are not unlike a dream in themselves. In discussing this narrative technique Rohlich makes an important point about classical narrative that also has modern impli- cations. As an example he takes the flashbacks that are used to tell the early history of the Hoyang Consort. When Chfinagon first meets the Consort there is an immediate flashback to the time of her father's sojourn in Japan and her subsequent birth. This is followed by another flashback in which we learn how the Consort reacted to her early separation from her mother. Only then do we return to the original time frame. Rohlich remarks, "What is significant in terms of narrative technique in these flashbacks is the tempo of the story and the fact that time measured as a sequence of events is broken down by the manner of the telling" (p. 44). The narrator is not so concerned about external time as with inner space, with what the character has come to feel over time. As in Genji, and in modern fiction as well, events that occur simultaneously appear in different parts of the story, and later events precede those that happened before them. The dreams focus our attention on particular emotions; they concentrate our attention in much the same way as the poems imbedded in the prose narrative of an uta monogatari. Rohlich limits his remarks in the introduction to purely literary matters, and for the most part this is as it should be. A reading of</page><page sequence="6">224 Journal of Japanese Studies Hamamatsu Chfinagon monogatari, however, opens up other areas of inquiry-religious beliefs concerning dreams and karmic causal- ity, contemporary attitudes toward China-that might recommend the book to students of religion and history. It was commonly believed that spirits called on one another when their bodies lay fast asleep-this is certainly not unique to Hamamatsu Chfinagon monogatari. What is interesting is the way dreams function in the story as a sort of Heian Western Union. Rohlich analyzes the vari- ous functions of dreams in the narrative; he explains how they move the plot forward, increase suspense, and enable the narrator to tell us what is going on in far-distant lands without his having to change the setting. The Consort's father, still dallying in Japan, is in a quandary over what to do with his daughter when he returns to China. He prays fervently to the Dragon King of the Sea, and the answer comes to him in a dream. "Your daughter is to be a consort in that land," he is told. "Take her with you immediately" (p. 135). A man appears in the Consort's dream and instructs her to send her young son to Japan with Chfinagon, a command that she follows, however sadly. When Chuinagon first meets the Consort's mother he learns that she already knows all about him-the Consort has come to her mother in a dream to warn of his impending arrival. Where do these voices come from? Who are these men who come under cover of darkness to direct the affairs of sleeping mor- tals? They seem suspiciously like Old Testament angels. Rohlich calls such dreams "messengers of karmic causality" but delves no further. In other contemporary works of literature, karma, though important, is treated as coincidental and passive and unknowable, but in this work it becomes an intelligent force, complete with anthropomorphic messengers, to guide individual human destinies. Rohlich's brief introduction is no place for an exhaustive disserta- tion on Heian religious beliefs concerning dreams as "karmic mes- sengers," but it would have been interesting if he had pursued the questions raised by his own remarks and the events of the story. Finally, Hamamatsu Chfinagon monogatari yields some mar- velous insights into contemporary notions of China. We have all heard how the Japanese, embarrassed at their own supposed lack of sophistication, wrote this history or compiled that poetic anthology in repeated attempts to emulate the great cultural giant. It is obvious that the author of the story knew very little about life in China; Rohlich points out many of the exoticisms in his notes. What is even more interesting are the editorials on the superiority of things Japanese (particularly women!) that crop up in page after page. The</page><page sequence="7">Review Section 225 height of approbation when speaking of a Chinese lady is to say that she is able to conduct herself in a manner befitting a lady of Japan. And Chinese courtiers are pale fellows, indeed, in comparison with Chfinagon. With such a man as Chfinagon, they surmise, Japan must indeed be a remarkable place. Even the Emperor muses, "We should learn from this man. What could we possibly teach him, even of the arts of our own land?" (p. 57). What a refreshing-and amusing-change to see the Chinese vying for the approval of a Japanese, one of those "Eastern Barbarians" from beyond the pale of civilization! Rohlich's translation can only add to our enjoyment. Only occa- sionally does he lapse into a stilted, archaic-sounding English that is probably meant to echo classical Japanese. And the translations of certain words or phrases, particularly adjectives, which tend to do double and triple duty in classical Japanese anyway, strike one as unfelicitous from time to time. Expressions like "preciously charm- ing," "limitless beauty," and "inauspiciously wretched" sound too much like the original Japanese to set well in English. And the translation of maboroshi as "illusion" in several of the poems (e.g., p. 192) gives altogether the wrong impression. Rohlich has kept his annotation to a minimum, a decision which should be lauded, except when he neglects to explain Japanese terms that only a specialist is likely to understand. Often he does explain such terms, but only after they have already appeared sev- eral times. For example, on page 14 we find the Hoyang Consort playing the kin, but it is not until page 59 that the uninitiated reader finds a footnote to explain that the kin is not a trombone or a flute but a "seven-string bridgeless musical instrument resembling a zither." In annotating his work, Rohlich seems never to have decided whether he is addressing a specialist or "general reader." He will let an expression like "their tears ran red" pass without comment (p. 115), though this might set a reader unfamiliar with classical Japanese poetry to wondering if Heian Japanese suffered from chronic eye disease, but then he will paraphrase the meaning of perfectly obvious poems. None of this seriously detracts from the translation, but a little thought could have spared specialist and nonspecialist alike a certain amount of frustration. The most serious problem lies in the poems, of which there are over a hundred in the work. Though all of them are tanka, Rohlich renders them randomly into two, three, four, and five lines, depend- ing on the exigencies of the particular translation. With no explana- tion of the tanka form nor of kakekotoba, makurakotoba, and so on,</page><page sequence="8">226 Journal of Japanese Studies the reader may never realize the formal unity and extraordinary richness and complexity of the originals. Even a reader familiar with classical Japanese is helpless, for there is no romanization to ac- company the translations. Arguments can be made for any number of lines, but for anyone familiar with Japanese verse it is misleading and unsettling not to have some form. Quibbling aside, Rohlich has done a fine job translating a work that, though only a minor classic, has an interest all its own. Hamamatsu Chfinagon monogatari enhances our understanding of the monogatari genre as it continued to develop after its supreme flowering in Genji. The story, with its unique narrative techniques, religious beliefs, and attitude toward China, should appeal to specialist and nonspecialist alike, to students of literature, religion, and history. Best of all, it provides an answer to that perennial question, "Well, what can I read after Genji?"</page></plain_text>
