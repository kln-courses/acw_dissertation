<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NOETIC MODELS OF MYTHOLOGY AND METAPHYSICS1 MAX RIESER Attacks against metaphysics have been made on various grounds for a long time. Kant asked whether metaphysics may claim absolute theoretical certainty and gave a negative answer based on his epistemological point of view. But his denial did not prevent an outpouring of metaphysics in Ger- many. Auguste Comte adopted a historical point of view in his Cours de philos- ophie positive where he made the famous distinction of three phases in the evolution of the human mind, viz. the theological, the metaphysical, and the scientific: " In the theological stage, the spirit of man, seeking for the inti- mate nature of things, for the first and the final causes of all the effects that strike him, in a word for absolute knowledge, conceives phenomena as products of the action of numerous supernatural agents whose intervention explains all the apparent anomalies of the world. In the metaphysical stage, which is nothing else than a modification of the former, the superna- tural agents are replaced by abstract forces or entities inherent in various beings and regarded as capable of engendering all the observed phenomena, explained by assigning to every one of them a corresponding entity. At the positive stage we acknowledge the impossibility of acquiring absolute no- tions, we abandon the investigation of the origin or the destiny of the uni- verse and knowledge of the intimate causes of the phenomena, but try rather to discover their laws, i.e., the relationships of similarity and succession by the combined use of reasoning and observation." 2 The Vienna Circle tried to develop the Comtean position from a logical point of view. Rudolf Carnap, for example, states: "As regards those object-questions whose objects do not occur in the exact sciences, critical analysis has revealed that they are pseudo-problems. The supposititious sen- tences of metaphysics, of the philosophy of values, of ethics . . . are pseudo- sentences, they have no logical content, but are only expressions of feeling which in their turn stimulate feelings and volitional tendencies on the side of the hearer." 3 Carnap goes into much greater detail than Comte's three stages; but Comte did not say that metaphysical problems, or their prototypes in theol- ogy, were pseudo-problems. He merely said that we cannot solve these questions and therefore should turn to positive science. It may be added that the quotation from Carnap does not rest on pure 'logic,' but is partly epistemological, partly psychological. The French sociologists (Durkheim, Levy-Bruhl, Mauss, et al.) derived not only ideas but even categories of thought, such as causality, etc., from facts of group life. F. M. Cornford, the classical scholar who followed their lead, states that there is " an inward and substantial affinity " between re- 1 Ernst Topitsch, Vom Ursprung und Ende der Metaphysik (Vienna, 1958) is the text which is reviewed and discussed here. 2 Auguste Comte, La Philosophie Positive, Resume par Emile Rigolago (Paris, 1880) I, 24. 3 Rudolf Carnap, The Logical Syntax of Language (New York, 1951), 278. 300</page><page sequence="2">MYTHOLOGY AND METAPHYSICS 301 ligion and philosophy, adding that " if we now call it ' metaphysical ' instead of ',supernatural ', the thing itself has not substantially changed its charac- ter." 4 " Behind philosophy lay religion, behind religion . . . social custom, the structure and institutions of the human group.... The eternal laws, of which Antigone said that no one knew from whence they were proclaimed, can now be seen to have been projected, as a sort of Brocken spectre, from those very laws of the state with which she contrasts them." 5 Wilhelm Dilthey dealt with this problem in a psychological way. Such world-views as objective idealism, subjective idealism, and naturalism are according to him the result of behavior, life experience, and the structure of our psychic totality. They are rooted in life and the discussion among them cannot be terminated or decided. Cognition is not their only content. They are supposed to shape the ideals of the good life, etc.6 But, as we see here, Dilthey deals not so much with the reasons of world-views as with their motives. This is not the viewpoint of Comte. He sees in the three stages rather three evolutionary stages of human thought in general, and he com- bines phylogenetic with ontogenetic viewpoints in saying that the three stages also exist within the lifespan of the individual. Man as a child is a theologian, a metaphy-sician in his youth, and s-cientific in his mature age. Theology is then a characteristic of the childhood of mankind. Ludwig Feuerbach in his philosophy of religion saw in theological ideas projections of human conditions. He noted that man interprets nature ac- cording to human artefacts, constructing from art the original elements of nature. According to monotheism God is an absolute monarch, but to Feuerbach nature is a republic.7 Now, in the parlance of Ernst Topitsch, to whom we now turn, Feuerbach had adopted the same anthropomorphic or social model of thought he had criticized, though he interpreted the world differently through his republican model. Topitsch, of the University of Vienna, is the author of Vom Ursprung und Ende der Metaphysik (Vienna, 1958). He calls this study of the origin and end of metaphysics a critique of world-views. Basically he reaffirms Comte's view of the essential identity of religion and metaphysics and the hiistorical claim that this world- view is supplanted by the scientific world-view. Topitsch writes and thinks in the traditions of the Vienna Circle to which he did not belong because of his youth but with which he is connected through Viktor Kraft and through Philipp Frank, whom he met at Harvard as a Rockefeller fellow. Topitsch goes into many more historical details than his predecessors, and tries to sihow systematically the basic models of thought common to mythology, religion, and philosophy from Anaximander to Karl Marx. He acknowledges his indebtedness especially to his immediate predecessors such as Heinrich Gomperz and also to the jurist Hans Kelsen, products of Vienna University like himself. He builds on an astounding wealth of reading. 4F. M.

Ionian philosophy has been viewed in these two ways. The main representative of the view that it is a development of theology is Werner Jaeger." Heinrich Rickert had also affirmed 12 that the object of metaphysics is basically valuational and not factual. What onto- logical speculation tries to flnd out is not so much the " really real " but the ground of value. The metaphysics of the absolutely real seems to be ul- timately a philosophy of values. Ontological speculations without a value- background would be uninteresting; the main problem is valuational and not a 'problem of reality' (Wirklichkeitsproblem). Rickert thinks that all philosophical systems should be analyzed on the basis of such an assump- tion, and Topitsch acknowledges that his aim is to carry out at least part of Rickert's program. While he states this aim explicitly in his book, he is also implicitly carrying out an original program of the Vienna Circle which its members, engrossed mainly in logic, mathematics, and physics, could not carry out owing to their lack of training in the humanities. Since the study of Topitsch is anchored in an investigation of 'natural law ' it is pertinent to quote a statement of Kelsen that served as the lode- star of this investigation: " That which ha's so far been put forth as natural law, or what amounts to the same thing, as justice, consists for the most part of empty formulas, like suum cuique, 'to each his own', or meaningless tautologies like the categorical imperative . . . consequently all these for- mulas of justice have the effect of justifying any positive legal order. . . ." 13 Topitsch envisages three basic models of mythological, religious, and metaphysical thought: the biomorphic, sociomorphic, and technomorphic models. The latter two are subsumed under the category of 'intentional thought' or intentional world-view. Topitsch sees in mysticism a fourth model transcending the other three, especially the intentional world-view. 8 Journal of the History of Ideas, IV (1943), 161-176; reprinted in Philosophical Studies (Cambridge, Mass., 1953), and in Roots of Scientific Thought (N.

Biomorphic models and 'bi-sexual ideas ' were represented in Greece by Orphic-Pythagorean speculation, revived in Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism and rejected by Judaism and Christianity which used intentional models. The human body as a model has often determined the whole world-view, and intellectual processes are often viewed as haptic processes (of grasping, gathering, etc.). The models derived from planned activities are more im- portant. The universe seems sometimes to be a product of artistic activity or of craftsmanship or to have a social structure. The sociomorphic pic- ture of the world as determined by social and moral values is 'animistic' in the true sense of the word, much more so than 'psychization.' The technomorphic interpretation of the world is characterized by ' intention- ality.' Jean Piaget claims that 'the explanation of things by an intention' is more important than analogy with physical production. According to Ernst Cassirer, "myth . . . begins with the idea of purposeful activity . . . natural forces are utterances of a will." Also of interest is the idea of a world 'woven ' as a cloak and that of a 'heavenly tent' a,s Robert Eisler showe!d.14 The gods as craftsmen are often replaced by gods as rulers and kings. Kelsen showed that the basic forms of understanding the world are not impersonal causal relations but the social models of merit and reward, guilt and atonement.15 The idea of gods as craftsmen is discernible in philosophy from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas. While on the one hand biological phenomena are in- terpreted technomorphically, on the other hand the human body and the universe are interpreted as social organizations. Figures are endowed with cosmic meaning. 'Two' may mean sun and moon, heaven and earth, day and night; 'three ' heaven, earth, and underworld, i.e., the three stories of the world-edifice. There is the idea that the world is an edifice resting on four pilasters but this is also reversed so that a temple represents the cosmos. The idea of 'an army of stars' arises in Mesopotamia and reappears in the Bible as 'heavenly hosts.' In the Bible the creation of the world is an act of will (intentional), and the genesis of human beings is explained by tech- nomorphic models. Interesting is the idea of a ' celestial city' in Judaism taken over by Christianity (heavenly Jerusalem). The vestments of the Jewish High Priest represent, like those of the god Marduk, the 'world- mantle." Cupolas are interpreted as reproductions of the vault of the sky. The Pantheon in Rome has a cosmic meaning; Hadrian constructed a 'villa' with the vault imitating the sky. Technomorphic models are visible in Isaiah when he compares the sky with a vaulted chamber (Is. 40,28), an idea taken over by Philo who considered the whole universe as the true shrine of deity, while the Christian Eusebius used the sociomorphic image of the 'divine King of the universe'. The cupola crowning Hagia Sophia in Constantinople is a symbol of the universe and the ancient Russian church is to be interpreted in a similar way. European architecture preserved the 14 Robert Eisler, Weltenmantel und Himmelszelt (Munich, 1910). 15 Hans Kelsen, Vergeltung und Kausalitdt (The Hague, 1946).</page><page sequence="5">304 MAX RIESER ancient cosmological motifs, while the German emperor Otto I donned once more the cosmic mantle of the Jewish High Priest. The speculations of the Ionian philosophy were not based on observation and experiment, but like myths were rooted in the observations of the phenomena of human life. 0. Gigon states that when Anaximander says (biomorphically) that the germs of warm and cold separated themselves from the world-ground, he considers the latter as' a living being."' The 'air' of Anaximenes has the power to ' rule' (as our soul-which is air-rules us). Egyptian theology already had postulated that the world- ground must be ' perfect ' and this is the predicate of the ' apeiron ' which is an unstructured world-ground, deathless, incorruptible, uncreated-all of which is'strongly valuational. Alcmaeon of Crotona compared the human body to the state, and this parallel is fully developed in Democritus and points to Plato: human beings are dominated by god and in man 'logos"' rules partly over temperament (thymos) and wholly over desire (epithymia). The ideas of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the Atomists about being and becoming (and perishing) show that they used a technomorphic model from the building-trade where stones pre-exist and survive the building. Just as in the Bible the order of nature is. sealed by a 'covenant,' in Empedocles it is sealed by a 'solemn oath' (platys horkos), and in Lucretius by 'covenants of nature' (foedera naturai). Anaxagoras' reason (nous) rules like a cosmocrat; his preroga- tives are 'ordering' (diakosmein) and 'ruling' (archein). Parmenides shied away from intentional interpretation of the universe but his negative theology, already visible in Xenophanes, furnished the eternal negative predicates of Being (deathless, unborn, only one, whole, without beginning); it is not undetermined, however, because it would then lack perfection. Parmenides made the logical discovery that Being alone is, while Non-Being is not-a tautological truth without content. Nevertheless this Being was in some valuational relationship to man. As for the world-principle of Heraclitus, it is also purely intentional: the reasonable fire, the understand- ing (gnome) rules. Heraclitus had a sociomorphic world-view, a-s Joel showed, its main categories being: ruling, reason, right, law, measure, etc. Heraclitus believed in a world-law as the matrix of all human laws. This world-law is the reflection of a sociomorphic model projected into the world. The law allegedly ruling the cosmos is superimposed on its prototype, the law of the state, and becomes the paradigm of eunomy in society. It be- came also one of the main themes of traditional philosophy: the idea of na- tural law (lex naturalis). Heraclitus' idea of an all powerful world-law raised the problem of cosmodicy or theodicy which has persisted ever since. Plato tried to overcome the valuational irrationality of the world of ex- perience by superimposing on it a better world of Ideas, which then became the ' real ' world of which the bad world is an imperfect copy; this is a technomorphic concept, the original being a blue-print and its execution. In Timaeus the world is a result of craftsmanship, we have there the idea of a divine foreman (demiurge); but we have in Plato sociomorphically three virtues: wisdom, courage, and moderation corresponding to three classes: food-producers, soldiers, and teachers. Here we have also a hierarchy 16 0. Gigon, Der Ursprung der griechischen Philosophie (Basel, 1945).</page><page sequence="6">MYTHOLOGY AND METAPHYSICS 305 within man, in the sense of Alcmaeon, perhaps influenced by Pythagoras. Aristotle was too much impressed by the values of the actual world to accept the Platonic theory of ideas. He construed his theory of causality on a technomorphic model. The four causes are best illustrated by the example of a building. The efficient causes of the process of building are the architect and the workmen; the purpose or final cause is the perfected house. The material cause is in the stones and earth, and the formal cause is the con- cept of the house. Aristotelian potentiality and actualization have techno- morphic models, the former being the ability of a man to act, to realize a plan. The theology of Aristotle is valuational: where there is something better there must be something most perfect and that is the Divine. Aris- totle has a technomorphic answer to the question why there is so much evil in the world. Evil is merely privation, a deficiency without real existence, technomorphically Ispeaking a lack or a failing to fit into a plan. As against this view, Plato sociomorphically sees in evil a revolt of the inferior faculties of the soul. In Christian medieval theory, the idea of privation is accepted in theology and theodicy as the explanation of evil. Hellenistic civilization brought about a mingling of Greek and Oriental elements. As a result the intentional world-view triumphs in Stoicism with two principles-, the active one, the Divine Logos and the passive one, matter. The eternal Logos manufactures all things out of matter; the ' fire of crafts- manship' (pyr technikos) builds the cosmos, the Logos rules like an Orien- tal monarch. The cosmic principle is sometimes a person, sometimes a law. The world-principle is realized as Necessity and Providence; necessity has a religious and not a causal character, for it is intentional. The idea of world- law or natural law is more articulate than in classical philosophy but 'to live according to nature' is an empty formula. If we imagine that a power motivated by valuational viewpoints rules the world, the problem of logodicy is bound to arise since the world of ex- perience is valuationally irrational. Another problem must also arise if a supreme power rules the world to which human will is subjected: the prob- lem of free will. Ethics requires a measure of human autonomy if individual responsibility is to be retained. But this problem of free will arises from the intentional world-view and is by no means a problem of psychology or of fact. It arises with the two schemes of action, the human and the celes- tial; the latter is superimposed on the former and conflicts with it. While Heraclitus said that the harmony of the world was based on con- tradictions, Plotinus compared it with a work of art where light and shad,e are harmoniously united in a composition. But this transference from the moral to the aesthetic (and contemplative) realm implies a denial of evil and an ethical deterioration since the world becomes a ' play.' Christianity absorbed the Hellenistic Oriental world-view for the Bibli- cal God was himself a cosmocrat as in the Oriental cults. Islam and Juda- ism also ;depended for their philosophical speculations on antiquity. The mystics leaned toward Neoplatonism. The Renaissance brought no basic changes but a shift from Aristotelian to Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Stoic notions. The intentional world-view in its Roman garb became the mother of Enlightenment which was its last flowering, but also prepared its destruc- tion when Reason ceased to be the Stoical Logos and became critical think- ing. Thus a world-view developed in mythical times, was rationalized in</page><page sequence="7">306 MAX RIESER philosophical speculation, and reached its crisis and dissolution in the En- lightenment. The world of Thomas Aquinas was still an ' oikos' with a planned order as in husbandry. Aquinas often employed the sociomorphic concepts of Aristotle. There is to be only one ruler, etc. Secondary causes (causae mediae) explain human failings. They act like subordinates for whom God is not responsible. The basic Christian forms of natural law are already present in Cicero, and Augustine took over the Stoic principles of natural law (nomos, logos, physis, cosmos) when he said: " Lex aeterna est ratio Di- vina vel voluntas Dei, ordinem naturalem conservari iubens, perturbari vetans " (Contra Faustum, XXII, 27). Nominalism criticized, the Thomistic doctrine of natural law and saw in the will of God the only source of justice. This absolute god became the model of the absolute monarch (princeps legibus solutus). Thus theological voluntarism was transferred to law, and Jean Calvin defines God's power in terms of Roman law. Hobbes then retransferred these predicates of God's power to the state as the mortal God. Carl Schmitt has maintained that the main concepts of constitutional law are secularized theological concepts.17 The opponents of denominational orthodoxy and supporters of 'natural religion ' appealed to the same Hellenistic Oriental traditions of Christian speculation. From the Enlightenment to Marxism we have the idea of a valuationally positive and rationally determined world-law conceived in the French Enlightenment after Cicero. The Hegelian-Marxian logo;s of history or the law of progress had a similar origin. Marx had a plan of salvation of quasi-scientific character and denounced it in others as an 'ideology.' According to Topitsch, the idea of 'law of nature ' is also derived from the intentional world-view. Descartes (but not Galileo) employed this ex- pression, adopted by Newton, and popularized by Voltaire. According to Montesquieu, the physical and the legal moral order both rest on divine world-law. The forms of thought of Enlightenment are based on the 'na- tural system,' i.e., on the intentional categories of Hellenistic thought. Not religious but political and social questions were the main concern of En- lightenment. Its representatives cared about the 'natural order ' of society and claimed that priests and tyrants prevented the rise of 'la loi naturelle.' Kant did not have one world-law like the Stoics but two isomorphic legal orders superimposed on one another: the lower order ' mundus sensibilis ' is under natural law while the ' mundus intelligibilis ' of rational beings is gov- erned by moral law. This is the ' cosmos noetos,' the realm of purpose (das Reich der Zwecke). As in Plato's Republic, the world is divided into two analogous spheres and the moral world is the model of the physical world, the former pointing to the latter in its forms of physical regularity. Kant's scientific ideal was co-determined by sociomorphic considerations. He wanted to save the laws of nature from Hume's assault and put them there- fore into our mind's interior so that understanding might become the law- giver of nature. This is, however, not a Copernican revolution but an eva- sive manoeuver. 17 Carl Schmitt, Politische Theologie. Vier Kapitel zur Lehre von der Souverdni- tat (Munich, 1934).</page><page sequence="8">MYTHOLOGY AND METAPHYSICS 307 In Bossuet and Voltaire we see how the idea of Progress arose as a secu- larization of the idea of Providence and a plan of salvation. The valua- tional aim is preserved in two concepts. To Hegel and to Marx history is a providentially guaranteed self-realization of the truly good; only Hegel is retrospective, Marx forward looking. (Hegel's system was called a Pan- logistic theodicy.) Hegel, like many predecessors, differentiated between real Being and deficient Being-the hallmark of idealism. He tried to exculpate the world logos by calling the undesirable 'non-being.' Marx similarly dis- tinguished true from seeming reality in a manner characteristic of the inten- tional world-view. Class society is to be condemned because it prevents man from becoming what he should be. Logodicy in historical materialism, however, is not what it was before, since it is enmeshed in a mixture of cau,sality, teleology, and' natural law. The scientific critique of the intentional world-view is older than the Marxist critique of ideologies. Atomic materialism developed the mechan- istic components of technomorphic models and explained everything accord- ing to the laws of motion of medium-sized bodies. The cognitive aims, methods of explanation, and thought-models of modern science differ as a matter of principle from the intentional world-view since science is value- free and does not seek to transfigure the universe or to create social norms but to state regularities. A number of critical reflections about Topitsch's analysis arise: 1. Even if philosophy or metaphysics retain some models dominating pre-philosophical thinking, the changes they undergo in the course of evolu- tion are sio great that the importance of those models decreases in proportion so as to become imperceptible, a mere shell, in the last stages. The value of the conceptions worked out does not lie in petrified models of the origins but in the contents of those later developments. The idea of Reason and its evolution as conceived by Hegel, for instance, may have some ancient prototypes but its value lies in the form it acquires in Hegel's handling of it. The scientific value or the philosophical importance of Marxism or of his- torical materialism does not lie in any plan of salvation buried beneath it but in the effort at rational analysis of the laws of social evolution. There may be something of a grown up individual to be seen in or derived from a germinal nucleus, but such a nucleus cannot be identified with the fully grown up individual. 2. Some problems may have meaning and yet be not decidable by sci- ence. Thus the question whether 'mind' or 'matter'is ultimately the stuff of reality is a question of philosophic interpretation and analysis, not of scientific fact. 3. 'Natural' law may have sociomorphic origins but this does not prove the non-existence of some moral or legal principles dominating human soci- ety apart from the concept -of natural law. 4. Metaphysical concepts may have an anthropomorphic basis, but those models were after all also natural facts which may serve as explanatory principles of other facts; in other words the analogy must not be un- grounded.</page><page sequence="9">308 MAX RIESER 5. It would be difficult to show that scientific thinking is completely free from anthropomorphic elements even in its mathematical phase, although control is easier here than in the more complicated matters usually dealt with in philosophy. 6. What really matters, historically speaking, in the development of philosophy is not so much the question whether it contained in its begin- nings any religious or mythological models, but how far it veered away from them. The main question is whether its effort was rational or mysti- cal. If the former was the case and if in Greece it outdistanced mythology and religion, then it was ' progressive' in its tendency, and this is the most important thing about it. There may be therefore some anachronism in Topitsch's analysis. He may have the intention of 'debunking' the 'ob- scurantism' of some dominant trends in contemporary continental philos- ophy, but progressiveness or backwardness are relative to the intellectual status of a given epoch. This is not said to minimize the usefulness or worth of the clarification provided by such investigations as that of Topitsch. Topitsch's epic of intentionality will probably not be able to eradicate metaphysics and replace it by science. Karl Jaspers asserts that science is unable to tell us the meaning of existence, and similarly, theologians like Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich think that only religion, i.e., the inten- tional world-view, -can tell us something about that meaning. The critics of metaphysics, such a-s Comte or the logical positivists or Topitsch, see in metaphysics a phase of human evolution to be displaced by a higher one, that of value-free science (in the sense of Max Weber). But as philosophy did not eliminate poetry or painting, it is doubtful whether science can elim- inate philosophy. Its greatest enemies are as a rule ' doing philosophy ' themselves. But the intentional world-view with its golden age in antiquity, its translucent varnish of Christianity in the Middle Ages, its silver age in the Enlightenment, and its final dissolution in the age of ' ideology ' is a fascinating picture to look at.
