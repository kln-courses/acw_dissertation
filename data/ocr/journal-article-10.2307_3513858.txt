A conexao estabelecida entre o trabalho de antropologia cultural que Pereira desenvolve e a sua producao poetica mostra uma realidade afro-brasileira de m6ltiplos discursos e representa as maneiras diferentes cor que a heranca africana se rearticula nas vozes do passado e do presente em Minas Gerais. Por isso, as primeiras divisoes deste estudo ("Colonial Minas Gerais," "The Devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary" and "Os Arturos") cumprem a funcao de introduzir o contexto tematico da obra de Pereira: o passado colonial mineiro, lugares hist6ricos, herancas africanas e transforma6ces culturais em Minas Gerais. INTRODUCTION This study discusses the literary production of Edimilson de Almeida Pereira, a poet and anthropologist from Minas Gerais, contextualizing his poetry in a historical, social, racial, and religious context.' His poetic production describes the most prosaic situations of everyday life, often in combination with a reading of history and tradition. It unveils a (uni)verse in which words fluctuate in a melodious rhythm, "ritmo de ouvido" ("a rhythm by ear")2 as he describes his style, creating unusual effects, especially through his precise choice and unorthodox combinations of words. In his poetry, the reader feels the strong presence of the land, and the palpable Afro-Mineiro tradition. He often draws from his training as an anthropologist and capitalizes on his interest in Afro-Brazilian history, literature and tradition by transmuting his experience as a field researcher to his poetic discourse as he himself acknowledges: "It is certainly a poetry engaged with my history as a black man" ("An interview" 51). In his literary creation, language is also part of a mystic and historical environment used in the backlands of Minas Gerais and/or in the religious and secular Afro-Mineiro rites, recounting the past without losing sight of significant changes in the present. Since Pereira has also written extensively about Os Arturos, a semi-rural community, located in Contagem, Minas Gerais, I found it useful to offer a preliminary introduction to this community's rites and rituals (Missa Conga, Candombe, Joao do Mato) and comment on the poetic discourse used in their chants, stories and ceremonies. It was precisely the beauty and sophistication imbued in the rituals and ceremonies performed by Os Arturos, the symbolic, mythic, and linguistic imaginary that captured Pereira and Nubia P. de Magalhaes Gomes' interest, leading them to develop the anthropological project "Minas e Mineiros/Veredas Sociais" and Pereira to write two books of poetry (Arvore dos Arturos and Os Arturos. Olhos do Roscrio). The historical and cultural analysis which precedes the literary exegesis in this study fulfills the functions of introducing - prior to dealing with Pereira's poetic strategies - the rich cultural context from which he extracts his themes: Minas Gerais' colonial past; historical settings; cultural transformations; and cultural practices of African origin.

In the first half of the eighteenth century, Minas Gerais had the largest population in Brazil and a complex and diversified economy. The web of population growth and its ethnic and economic diversity (white masters, poor whites, slaves, free persons of color) fostered an uneven social and racial stratification in Minas Gerais (even within the black population).3 There seems to be a consensus among researchers that the manumission of slaves in Minas Gerais was more frequent than in other areas of Brazil. Many scholars believe that this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that Minas Gerais had a more "democratic" society showing fewer signs of social and economic hierarchy due to a larger distribution of wealth in that state. Other researchers argue that the economic crisis which started in the 1740s, and culminated in an abortive rebellion (Inconfidencia Mineira) in 1789, contributed to the elevated number of slaves who received freedom in Minas Gerais at the time. They see a direct relation between that economic crisis and the freedom of so many slaves since it was expensive to maintain manual labor when work was not available.4 However, as Eduardo Franca Paiva counter-argues, a theory of a "larger distribution of wealth" alone cannot explain the number of manumissions in Minas Gerais given that "the growth in number of freed slaves, during that period and throughout the judicial districts, seems not to be linked to a crisis . . . but to the possibilities engendered by the existent economic diversity, especially in the urban areas" (21).5 It may also be questioned why the black population chose to escape and live in seclusion in the numerous quilombos in colonial Minas Gerais if, indeed, the class strata were highly flexible and fluid, social ascension was easy, and freedom was effortlessly bought as some historians have discussed.6 Basing their research on the remaining documents found in the archives of several cities in Minas Gerais and on the written recollections of foreign travelers at that time, Niubia Pereira de Magalhaes Gomes and Edimilson de Almeida Pereira build a case against the argument of a fluid and mobile society in colonial Minas Gerais. They believe that the apparent social mobility that the statistics seem to confirm was a disguised form of control established by slave owners, especially when considering that the slaves' freedom could be revoked for "bad behavior." As they have discussed: There was only an ideology of the possibility of social ascension, transmitted by the dominant class, in order to comply with the demands of the slave system. Such virtual ascension reinforced the basis of slavery through the weakening of the oppressed's desire to react. (Negras raizes 39) Since the Portuguese colonial ideology often relied on the rationale of the Christianization of African peoples to justify slavery, the Portuguese Crown encouraged missionaries to organize black lay brotherhoods. Portugal followed the tradition already established in other European countries of organizing confraternities. In the fifteenth century, Portugal had "Catholic brotherhoods that counted among their members blacks brought from Africa, as well as whites of Iberian stock" (Russell-Wood 567). Prior to the colonization of Brazil, with religious and social purposes, Dominican missionaries spread the devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary in Portugal. Records indicate that, as early as 1552, in colonial Brazil, although in an embryonic stage, there were attempts to organize confraternities for the Africans brought from Guinea. In 1589, to attend the needs of the slaves working in the sugar plantations and sugar mills of Pernambuco, two Jesuits organized a black brotherhood (Russell-Wood 567; Mulvey, "Slave Confraternities" 41). 64</page><page sequence="3">Several factors played a crucial role in the development of these fraternal organizations of which the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Rosary was the oldest and the most popular. The slave owners generally supported the black lay confraternities because having slaves involved in these associations meant social prestige for the slave owners (paying the brotherhood dues indicated their economic strength and earned them the reputation of having a good Christian heart). The confraternities were also used as controlling devices that benefited the masters since their slaves would receive indoctrination into the dogmas of Catholicism. Furthermore, membership in these associations was a form of long-term investment for the slave owners since these black brotherhoods often buried slaves at no cost to the owners.7 These sodalities were ambiguous institutions since they served the colonizer's purpose, but also became a space for the preservation of cultural practices of African origin as the slaves managed to introduce many African rituals into Catholic festivities. The members of these black lay brotherhoods were "... in charge of the myriad duties of collecting alms, rendering social services, running festivals, arranging for masses for the dead and keeping the church in good order" (Mulvey, "Black Brothers" 252). The confraternities offered the slaves the guarantee of receiving a dignified burial, aided them in times of need and sickness, provided them with the financial and moral support to buy their freedom papers; and, quite often, the freed Africans received help to establish a living in the community. In addition, these brotherhoods, and the churches built by their members, would afford a cultural identity and a social and ethnic space to the African population, and "insured the black members a meeting place apart from the watchful eyes of their white masters" (Mulvey, "Black Brothers" 256). The Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Rosary was the oldest, the most exclusive, the most popular, and the most numerous in Brazil - Mulvey estimates that 50% of all black confraternity members of colonial Brazil belonged to the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Rosary ("Black Brothers" 256). The devotion to black saints (Our Lady of the Rosary, Saint Ephigenia, and Saint Benedict) followed, under pastoral pressure, the mythic model offered by the Catholic Church. However, by incorporating their own traditions into the religious prescription of the Catholic cult, the slaves also subverted the Church's order and exercised cultural resistance in different forms and degrees. The association that the slaves established between the rosary (which was used in the slaves' devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary) and the opeles (the ifd beads that Africans used to communicate with their gods) constitute examples of the subversion of the imposed religious model.8 Whenever possible, slaves incorporated their cultural practices of African origin into the Catholic rituals, festivities and beliefs. Painters of the nineteenth-century considered the festivals of the black brotherhoods both colorful and extravagant. Ecclesiastic and governmental authorities labeled them licentious and, at times, forbade their performance because of the overall entertaining quality of the parades, the rich costumes used, and the profane and lascivious dances which they performed in the processions and during the festivals (Mulvey, "Slave Confraternities" 48-49). Additionally, most confraternities would elect a "King and a Queen of Congo" for their annual procession, as part of the services which they held in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary. Such positions would confer to the elected members the symbolic privilege of "free citizens" and provide them with the metaphorical space of the positions which they (or their ancestors) occupied in Africa. The title of a "King" and a "Queen" also supplied them with "subjects," the other members of their brotherhood whu would follow them during the religious processions.9 Barbosa 65</page><page sequence="4">Luso-Brazilian Review, 37/1 THE DEVOTION TO OUR LADY OF THE ROSARY IN MINAS GERAIS By the end of slavery in Brazil (1888), Africans had left their mark in Minas Gerais, impregnating the land with their sweat, labor, stories, languages, music, and belief systems. The African legacy thrived in colonial times and, although nowadays it is less visible in Minas Gerais than in Bahia, it remains a driving force, emerging in the cultural, artistic and religious elements that characterize that state. The African heritage in Minas Gerais is diffused in popular traditions like Folia dos Reis and Congados; it is imprinted in legends like those of Xica da Silva and Chico Reis; it has been inscribed in its mixed population, immortalized in music and literature, solidified in baroque architecture of which the works of the mulatto Aleijadinho constitute the best example; is mapped out in remaining communities of African descent throughout Minas Gerais; and has materialized in the devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary.'? Statistics indicate that, between 1711 and 1780, a large number of confraternities were organized in Minas Gerais, especially in Ouro Preto, Diamantina, Sabara, Sao Joao del Rey, Serro, and Mariana, comprising a number of twenty-one colored lay brotherhoods of which eleven were black and ten mulatto. More than half were devoted to Our Lady of the Rosary (Salles 31-37; Russell-Wood 576). The devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary and the festivities (also called Congados) are performed in a three-day festival in October and still constitute a driving religious force in black communities in Minas Gerais. Although Congados in different areas of Minas Gerais share some common features and procedures (the display of Our Lady of the Rosary's banner, procession, some religious services, singing special songs and chants, performing their traditional dances, displaying their costumes, and drumming through the streets of towns), the emphasis on certain facets of the festival, the desacralization, or even the elimination of certain features of the celebration, vary largely within the Afro-Mineiro groups. Within the remaining Afro-Mineiro communities, four have attracted the close attention of researchers, especially in regards to the poetic language of their songs, the choreography of their dances, their liturgical ceremonies, and the historical and religious significance of their celebrations. Marcia Clementino Nunes has discussed the historical and symbolic significance of the devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary for the black population of Serro, an historical city in Minas Gerais. Leda Maria Martins has extensively studied the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Rosary in Jatoba, in the county of Belo Horizonte. In Afrografias da memdria, she presents a careful discussion of the genealogy, chants, songs, images, their oral tradition and their linguistic rituals. Gomes and Pereira discuss two other communities: Mato do Ti:ao, in Jaboticatubas (Mundo encaixado. significado da cultural popular) and Os Arturos (Negras raizes mineiras, and Arturos. olhos do rosario) detailing and analyzing the historical and cultural development of these communities, and the significance that the devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary has in their members' social and religious imaginary. To date, Gomes and Pereira's study of Os Arturos remains the most extensive, detailed, and comprehensive about any of these communities. OS ARTUROS A semi-rural, communal family, approximately 500 members, located 2.5 Km from the center of Contagem, and 23 Km from downtown Belo Horizonte, Os Arturos is the community in Minas Gerais that has best preserved the devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary. It was named after Arthur Camilo Silverio whose strong personality kept the members of his extended family together and their traditions alive. Legal documents indicate that Os Arturos' property (encompassing 6.5 hectares of land) was acquired in 1888, a fact that has led Gomes and Pereira to question the notion that the community was a "legalized 66</page><page sequence="5">quilombo" because "the property, bought right after the Abolition, no longer needed to be used as a refuge for escaped slaves" (Negras raizes 122). The allusion to quilombos in the chants is an historical reference, similar to those which they make about Africa, slavery and their African past. Besides public activities - a celebration of the Abolition of Slavery (which takes place in May), paying homage to Our Lady of the Rosary (in October), and the Wise Men festivities (during the Christmas cycle), this community holds numerous private ceremonies and celebrations. Music, dance and religion have played a significant role in keeping the members of this community together and their traditions alive. It is in these historical moments of continual transformation that the members of Os Arturos teach their children the meaning of who they are and how to historicize their lives and pass on their cultural imaginary. For instance, during the ceremony of the celebration of the Abolition of Slavery, they re-enact some customs and practices of slavery in colonial Minas Gerais, and read the abolition law (Lei Aurea). They also dance, sing, and drum as they parade through the streets of Contagem in organized dancing and singing groups, named Guardas de Congo and Guardas de Mo'ambique, headed by their King and Queen, a tradition that dates back to the festivities of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Rosary in colonial Brazil. The coronation of the King and Queen of Os Arturos, also called Reinado, takes place on a Monday, the last day of the festival, and follows the model established in colonial Brazil in which, during the festivities of Our Lady of the Rosary, the parish priest would crown the King and the Queen. In the religious and social hierarchy established in Os Arturos, the "captains" and the King and the Queen constitute the higher echelon of their community as Gomes and Pereira have noted in their discussion of the social and religious structure of Os Arturos: In the religious hierarchy, the captains, who guard the secrets of the Rosary and lead the singing, stand out. They are the initiates, receiving the mission of teaching their faith because of their knowledge or devotion. But the supreme leaders in their religious order are the King and Queen of Congo, represented in the family by members who occupy honorable positions: Geraldo Arthur Camilo is King of Congo of the state of Minas Gerais, while his sister, Juventina Paula Lima, is the Queen of Congo in Contagem. (Arturos 17) Missa Conga (Congo Mass) is a recent addition to the rituals performed by Os Arturos (it began in the 1950s), although it should not be considered unusual since the celebration of a mass was part of the activities which marked the brotherhoods' calendar of Our Lady of the Rosary in colonial Minas Gerais. Thus, inscribing a cultural and religious presence from the past in the second half of this century, Missa Conga became part of the celebration of the Abolition of Slavery (May 13). The Afro-Brazilian and Catholic elements present in Missa Conga also resemble the syncretism evident in the festivals of the brotherhoods in colonial Brazil in which "profane" songs and dances were incorporated into processions to honor their patron saints. Missa Conga also includes singing and drumming at the main door of their chapel, asking the priest's permission to come in and pray - a theatrical performance to remind people of the times in which slaves were not allowed in the whites' church. Missa Conga follows a similar ritualistic structure to that of the standard Catholic mass, with differences occurring through choice of songs, distinctive festive apparel and offertory gifts when the King and Queen of Congo offer their crowns and swords, their symbols of power (Gomes and Pereira, Negras raizes 191-97). Candombe is one of the most significant rituals practiced by Os Arturos. It is a Kimbundu word meaning dances and celebration by blacks. It is the choreography of the sacred, a hybrid rite which sustains sacred characteristics but also becomes a form of Barbosa 67</page><page sequence="6">Luso-Brazilian Review, 37/1 entertainment, amusement, a pastime, a rite to celebrate the ancestors and to dialogue with forebears. Candombe is a very simple ritual, in which the participants use only three drums to address the ancestors and historicize their presence. The historical, religious and ludic references noticeable in their rites and festivities are filtered through the sacred language of the drums and the poetic discourse of the chants. The drumbeat, the dances, and the choice of words for their chants have the utmost importance in establishing the connection between the sacred and the profane. While Candombe and the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomble share some common features (they are supported by songs, dances, and drum calls), differences are also noticeable. In Candombe elders also occupy the central stage as the drums invoke their ancestors, but the dancers do not enter a state of trance as described by those who practice Candomble. However, the transformation that the drum call exercises on the elders, the physical flexibility displayed by the older people, and their graceful movements as they perform the semi-acrobatic dance steps of Candombe have led researchers to believe that they enter a quasi-altered state of consciousness (Gomes and Pereira, Negras raizes 218). Jodo do Mato (Bush Man) is another traditional festivity performed by Os Arturos. It is a ritual involving singing and the weeding of their land in which all members of the community participate to rid their fields from destructive vegetation (it is done in December, preceding the Christmas Cycle). One member of the community who dresses up in a special costume/disguise made of leaves of different plants and hides in a bush represents Jodo do Mato, the "weed." When the weeding is close to an end, Jodo do Mato appears and is chased by the members of the community, and he finally parades in front of them (who have lifted their hoes in a position of attack to symbolically kill him). Gomes and Pereira trace the origin of this ritual to several sources, including European and indigenous Brazilian rites, and practices of African origin (Negras raizes 235-38). Besides the obvious pragmatic, historical, and economic reasons (the mutual help in preparing and/or cleaning the fields for a better crop) that might have led the community to develop the performance of this activity into a ritual, there are also other symbolic explanations. Gomes and Pereira have analyzed the religious components and anthropomorphic representations that are part of the structure of this ceremony, discussing, for instance, the community's fight and victory against Jodo do Mato as a triumph against the low, negative forces of nature. Since Jodo do Mato symbolizes death to the crop, for the members of the community, his banishment and removal from their midst indicate a renewal of good wishes and actions against evil, and also indicate the victory of life against death (Negras raizes 233-59). One of the key elements to understanding the significance of the rituals performed by Os Arturos is the observer's ability to realize the beauty and sophistication of the poetic discourse existent in the popular language used in their songs, chants and prayers. It would be too limiting to interpret their celebration of the Abolition of Slavery, or any other of their public festivities, simply as a political statement or an historical celebration. At the same time that it reenacts a crucial historical moment for them as Afro-Brazilians, combining religious tradition and cultural heritage within the social space of linguistic and theatrical performance, a poetic language emerges to intermingle with the political and the ludic discourse. This is a moment in which "a mem6ria do gesto" ("gesture's memory")" inscribes the reshaping, the curving, the bending and channeling of social, historical, political, and religious manifestations into a hybrid discourse. The intersection of many "voices" leads to a moment of tension (and sometimes conflict) in which the revisionary discourse of the displaced Other that the members of Os Arturos embody interrogates culture and affixes new meanings to their lives. The symbolic representation of the past engraves a voice that is transmuted into their present experience. Although such experience originated in a mappable and describable past, it is reconfigured in the cultural imaginary of generations for whom the past is mythic and symbolic. In this case, Pereira's expression ("a 68</page><page sequence="7">mem6ria do gesto") describes well how it is through the past that the present regains significance to unfold into other future signs. The reinvented, metaphoric language which Os Arturos uses in chants, stories, and even in the explanations of situations, objects, and their functions becomes the social and cultural articulation played within the folds and infinitudes of the community's religious and ludic discourse. In Candombe, for instance, within a fixed structure of chants, improvisation opens a space for creative language to analyze and reinstate the moment in which the sacred and the profane touch (although there is no synthesis). In this case, the language of the body also articulates the dance of the words, capturing the symbolic and metaphoric function of the historical, social, and cultural dynamism that prevails for Os Arturos. STRATEGIES OF POETIC DISCOURSE Pereira frequently inscribes historical and cultural practices in his poetic discourse, challenging the tenets of an essentialist nationalism that overlooks regional differences and cultural diversity. According to him, it would be impossible to speak of an Afro-Brazilian "identity" because it is a palimpsest written and re-written by successive historical inscriptions varying by region. He refers to an Afro-Brazilian identity as a plural identity, a fractured macrocosm in which tradition and culture are not closed-in absolutes. For him, the Afro-Brazilian tradition resembles an old, half-tor drum that does not resonate harmoniously because it presents several conflicts engendered in its diversity and in its historical past (Pereira, "Com modos" 101). In Aguas de contendas (White Waters), a name he borrows from a city in Minas Gerais, he uses the metaphor of white waters to indicate the state of tension and conflict that permeates the Afro-Brazilian culture. He describes waters clashing with themselves and with rocks, wavering, struggling, striving and competing to represent the feelings in which human beings circulate and navigate, often in a struggle with tradition, with others, and even with themselves (Pereira, "Com modos" 115). In the poem, "Tres tambores sagrados," ("Three Sacred Drums") published in Arvore dos Arturos (Arturos' Genealogy), Pereira captures the significance of the sacred drums (Santana, Santaninha and Jeremia) in the ritual of Candombe as performed by Os Arturos, and analyzes how the voices of the drums function as a reminder of tradition, the ancestors, and the sacred space, also inscribing a moment of joy, celebration, and the need to "hold on to the meaning of the words." As the poem indicates, it is in language, and through language, that tradition is constantly reinvented and kept alive: "Tres tambores sagrados" "Three Sacred Drums" Sao tres os tambores, como Three are the drums, as tres sao os fogos: no passado three are the fires: in the past ensinam os antigos. Hoje the elders teach. Today os meninos que ouvem. Sao dois the children listen. They are two e o terceiro 6 o tempo mordido. and the third is pierced time. o santana, o santaninha e o santana, santaninha and... sao tres os tambores sagrados! three are the sacred drums. 0 menino, toma sentido!

Os antigos riscam o silencio Our ancestors cross out silence e as caixas batem no escuro. and drums beat in the dark. 0, nego! A festa 6 dos antigos! Hey, black! The celebration belongs to the ancestors! Barbosa 69</page><page sequence="8">Luso-Brazilian Review, 37/1 o santana, o santaninha e o sao os tres tambores sagrados! No Candombe furam o medo e o chao se veste de calos. 0, menino, voce aprende a rezar! Aue, nego, nao perde o sentido nao. Sao tres mil os tambores. o santana, o santaninha e o sao tres os tambores sagrados! santana, santaninha and ... they are the three sacred drums! In Candombe they puncture fear and the floor is dressed in calluses Hey, child, you'd better learn how to pray! Hey, black, hold on to the meaning of the words. Three thousand are the drums. santana, santaninha and ... three are the sacred drums! In this poem Pereira omits the reference to Jeremia (perhaps because this drum receives different names in the Afro-Mineiro communities), replacing it by a pulsating and resonating Time that has been arrested by language, history, and tradition. Time (the third drum) grasps the rhythm of the soul and is absorbed and transformed in the moments of the body politic. Although the word "sentido" (in "Aue, nego, nao perde o sentido nao") was translated as "meaning," it renders itself to other significations since it may also connote "sense" and "attention" as in "don't lose your senses" or "pay attention." The senses become the vehicle through which human experience, the historical process, and constructed time are taken in attentively, ingested, and cannibalized. 2 As "Tres tambores sagrados" indicates, the drumbeat of Time assigns for the family members of Os Arturos a meaning in the present while anchoring their experience in the historical past. In his poem "Missa Conga," also published in Arvore dos Arturos, Pereira discusses the syncretic and religious macrocosm in which the community abides. The poem inscribes a shifting and splitting movement in which time and space complement and supplement each other, filling each other's voids.'3 Pereira plays with the mobility of identity as both a symbolic borderland and a liminal space. The poetic voice crosses boundaries as it attempts to be part of the ceremony while simultaneously distancing itself from that cultural moment by analyzing it. Confronted with the movement of African traditions and Catholicism, startled by the displacement of identity, confused by the desire for a confinable, visible, palpable, measurable and describable signifying element, the poetic voice interrogates culture: Missa Conga Congo Mass Para que deuses se reza quando o corpo aprendeu toda a linguagem do mundo? Que ora9oes se entoa quando a alma se entregou a todas as dores do mundo? Onde se deitam os olhos quando o altar dos antigos se ocultou nas sombras? To what gods does one pray when the body has learned all languages of the world? What prayers does one intone when the soul has surrendered itself to all the pains of the world? Where does one rest the eyes when the altar of the elders has hidden itself in the shadows? 70</page><page sequence="9">Barbosa Para que deuses se reza To what gods does one pray quando as palavras se velam when the words veil themselves para invocar seus nomes? to invoke their own names? Que sacrificio se oferta What sacrifices does one offer nos dias em que os antepassados in the days in which the ancestors ainda se escondem? still conceal themselves? Por que nao entregar a vida Why not surrender life ao deus com olhos de pluma to the feather-eyed god que vive no fundo dos tempos? who lives at the bottom of Time? In "Missa Conga," Pereira accomplishes what Homi Bhabha discusses in The Location of Culture as "the discursive strategy of the moment of interrogation, a moment in which the demand for identification becomes, primarily, a response to other questions of signification and desire, culture and politics" (49-50). Pereira represents the tension, the conflict, the space of interrogation and self-questioning that he finds in Os Arturos and in other Afro-Mineiro communities and, by extension, in the Afro-Brazilian cultural imaginary. The poetic voice also dialogues with culture, history, literature, and with the author himself. The "space of interrogation" in this poem is also part of the post-modem, meta-poetic discourse in which the self-reflexive and reflective elements of the text also examine language. As an illustration, language's self-questioning is most obvious in the fourth stanza, in which the lyric "I" expresses its uncertainty as it asks to what gods one should pray when words are autonomous, volatile, and render themselves to a ludic dicourse. The poem's polysemic discourse flaunts itself in words such as the verb "velar" ("quando as palavras se velam") which means "to veil, cover, conceal," but also signify "be alert, and vigil." As history and literature attest, at times, the relationships between masters and slaves in Minas Gerais were complex, involving different systems of negotiation. When occasions proved favorable, slaves used to circumvent the King's laws, deceive and outwit their masters as they conceived ways through which they could create a social, religious, and political space for themselves. Gomes and Pereira discuss such historical facts in their analysis of the symbolism present in the main altar in the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary in Tiradentes, Minas Gerais: In the main altar of this church it is quite noticeable that the half moon is topped by Our Lady of the Rosary's crown and that the four angels contemplating her have their eyes closed. . . . The angels' closed eyes are the iconographic representation of the harsh reality of the work of slaves, who, only at night, exhausted and sleep-driven, had time to build their temples. (Negras raizes 39) The historical past and the architectural details of the church served as a catalyst for Pereira's poetic inventiveness, materializing in the poem "Tiradentes" (included in the section "Igrejas do Rosario" in Aguas de contendas). The author analyzes the repressive system which forced the slaves to resort to working on Sundays, holy days and by the moonlight to build churches for their patron saints. The poem also presents the moon as an accomplice to the slaves' theft since it shed light on them as they built the church and trimmed the main altar with stolen gold from the mines, often hidden in their clothes and their kinky hair. 71</page><page sequence="10">Luso-Brazilian Review, 37/1 "Tiradentes" Lua de olhos cumplices Accomplice-eyed moon com o furto que a doura. with the theft that gilds you.

Com o dia esclarecido In enlightening daylight os burlados contemplam the deceived ones contemplate sua burla. their deceit. In the poem "Avisos de praga" ("Notices in the Market Place"), also from Aguas de contendas, Pereira analyzes the repressive strategies and practices existent during the period prior to the abolition of slavery in Brazil in which Africans were treated as commodities. The auction to which the poem refers (based on actual advertisements and documents) attests to the sale of Matheus Herculano de Paiva's estate which included slaves, livestock, furniture, and land improvements.'4 The names of oxen and slaves (Sabina, Mimoso, Francez, Joaquim, Velludo, Hip6lito, Adao, Eva) are brought together. This aspect of the poem sheds light on the dehumanizing aspects of slavery, since the Penal Code in colonial Brazil and the ideological apparatus denied the slaves the rank of citizen and, consequently, that of person. But it also reiterates Gomes' and Pereira's claim that the so- called mobility and fluidity of the social system in colonial Minas Gerais was, in many instances, a myth created by those who held economic and political power (Negras raizes 66). The poem refers both to an historical documentation of economic transitions in colonial Brazil and to an actual biography of a district judge, Affonso Henriques Assis de Aguiar, who lived and worked in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais. His title, "Juiz de Orfaos" ("Judge of Orphans"), was a rank, similar to the position held by a "Juiz de Fora" (a circuit judge), an arbitrator who would not only dispense justice, but would also oversee and preside over ajudicial district. A "Juiz de Orfaos" was often in charge of auctioning orphan children of slave parents, and liquidating estates of deceased owners since bringing up slave children was considered unprofitable and burdensome. As Robert Levine has discussed: "[i]t was more efficient to cull from among young male slaves selected in Africa for their strength and stamina, in the slave auction pens of the port city of Salvador. .. than to have to worry about caring for Brazilian-born slave children ... until they were able to work as adolescents" (15). When I asked Pereira (in a phone interview) what motivated him to write this poem, he explained that he was inspired by historical documents which recorded the sales of slaves. While examining the documents, he pondered if, during slavery, everyone involved in slave transactions dealt with the business in a cold-blooded and calculating way. He imagined that there were moments in which some of the people who bought, sold, and chastised slaves, as well as those who documented the commercial transactions, had some sense of their wrong-doing, felt guilty, or had doubts about the moral aspects of their actions. It was then that he combined the biographical references that he found about Judge Assis de Aguiar with some information that he gathered from the sales transactions to create the poem "Avisos de praca." 72</page><page sequence="11">Barbosa "Avisos de Praca" "Vende-se um piano; em casa de Carlos Montreuil, na rua Direita, n. 25."

Affonso Henriques witnesses the unmarketable certainty miserere miserere. Former well-off Affonso impoverished proprietor of his invented letter. Perjurer scribe afonso mortgages his own craftmanship. In this poem, Pereira alternates narrative voices, including the voice of the scribe who documents the advertisements and auctions. The author weaves narrative levels and allows the historical voice to come forward and present to the reader the judge's own moral dilemma about auctioning human beings ("I, a sworn scribe, / devise and pay interest on / what I plan to do"). Furthermore, in the process of documenting facts, the scribe interrogates himself, his culture, history, time and space, questioning the truth in what he writes and advertises, setting a price for his words and actions. As he announces and writes in his public notary book the words and the prices of the auctioned goods, he also writes his self- inflicted questioning ("In each advertised slave / I see myself advertised"). In the last part of the poem, presented by a third-person narrative voice, the scribe's power and wealth diminishes in a direct relation to the increase of his moral dilemma and conflict. Such diametrical proportion is symbolically represented by his name. When he is first introduced in the poem he is Affonso Henriques Assis de Aguiar. After his moral dilemma has taken 74</page><page sequence="13">place, his name is gradually shortened until it becomes the modernized and simplified "afonso" (written with a single "f' and in lower case). The obvious changes and fluctuations in the narrative voices become a device that Pereira uses to instate a shift between past and present, to more easily examine the scribe's moral dilemma, and to destabilize centralization of meaning (a large number of words in the poem carry several connotations). "Orat6rio," for instance, could be read and discussed as "oratory/orator"; "letra" connotes "letter, word, promissory note"; and the word "monjollo,"'1 means a water-driven mill, but it also signifies young calves and slaves native to East Africa. The potential connotations and allusions that the verse "e argumentado mente" provokes can range from the one chosen in the translation ("when argued, lies") to others such as "argumentamente" ("arguably"). By a phonological association, the expression "outro sim" ("a different one," referring to a man who had had some insightful revelations) also evokes "outrossim" ("likewise"). In choosing to use the neologism "escrivente," rather than using the vernacular "escritor" (writer), or "escrivao" (public notary), and also by establishing a connection with "vivente" (living creature), Pereira re- structures the historical document and inscribes a new position for the key person in the poem. If the poem frames the historical past to delimit time and space (Pereira uses a real document as his poetic source), it also transgresses the historical time as it assigns a new voice to the scribe, that of analyzing his own deeds as he prepares and documents economic transactions, to a point in which "he mortgages / his own craftmanship." Although the Afro-Brazilian, and more specifically the Afro-Mineiro, heritage plays an important thematic part in Pereira's poetry, his concern with language - always in dialogue with cultural and literary tradition - has a crucial place in his poetic production. For him, words and their multiple connotations, like water or wind in constant motion and relocation, are generated by an endless recreation of the words' potential signification. The multitude of meanings in his poetry directs attention to the polysemic play of spoken and written words. Such concern about the multi-dimensional characteristics of words has always been part of Pereira's aesthetic. For instance, in his poem, "A pessoa e o termo" ("The person and the term/terminology") from Dormundo (a play on the words "pain" and "world"), Pereira uses the expression "o verbo devoluto" ("the unoccupied/vacant logos") to express his aesthetic concerns and the extensive possibilities for assigning different historical, cultural, and linguistic meanings to words: O verbo devoluto The vacant logos era o verbo que amavas was what you used to love noutros dias de tua vida. in bygone days of your life. The second part of his tripartite metalinguistic poem, "Instru9ao do homem pela poesia em seu rigoroso trabalho" ["Man's instruction by poetry in his rigorous work"], published in O homem da orelhafurada, also exemplifies Pereira's choice of language and aesthetics in his intense desire to analyze and define his own craft. 2 Porem escrevo. Para cem cartas mil lagartas. Quando a duivida imagina sentidos a terra j se viu madrinha de meus prov6rbios. [However, I write. For every hundred letters a thousand caterpillars. By the time doubt imagines meanings, the earth has already become the godmother of my proverbs.] Barbosa 75</page><page sequence="14">Luso-Brazilian Review, 37/1 Verbos provados, de camisa, colete e sapato. Assim como no ir a missa a procissao para ser mais amado do que o santo. [Words dressed in shirts, vests and shoes. Like the person who goes to mass or follows a procession to be more loved than the saint.] Quem nao risca nao sabe os rios da palavra, o labirinto de haver escrito sem estremecer. Eu mesmo me avio: parceiro da chuva, do capim cebola preparo um livro de cortar. [He who does not scribe does not know the rivers of the word, the labyrinth of having written without trembling. I dispatch myself: partner of the rain, of the weeping grass I prepare a sharp-edged book.] E se me perguntam: ainda nao 6 manha? E quando eu no verbo faco manha ou noite. A treva e a escrita nem mais, nem pois. Deus nao entortou linhas porque escrevia canhoto? [And if they ask me: isn't it morning yet? That's when in the logos I make morning or evening. Darkness is writing not more, or since. Didn't God bend lines because he was left-handed?] Medo s6 o da escrita com leitor viajante. Mas se ha leitor de lidas, a e b sao hist6rias inferas. Com modos e truques de ouvir. [Fear, only of writing with a traveling reader. But if there is an industrious reader, a and b are infernal stories. With listening gimmicks and wiles.] In the expression "verbos provados," the word "provado" means both "tasted" and "tried on." The word "risca," in combination with the other words in "Quem nao risca nao sabe os rios da palavra," means "crosses out, traces, marks, scribes, strikes" and - through its melodic rhythm- also evokes the verb "arriscar" (to risk), to dare writing. In the same stanza, another play on words creates the space for a gliding signifier to open up a number of connotations. "Aviar" means "to dispatch, to fill up a prescription, to do away with, to hurry, to move on," all of which could be applied to the reading of this verse. The set phrase in Portuguese, "nem mais nem menos" ("not more, nor less"), is adapted and combined with a multi-meaning word ("pois"). While such a combination points to the polysemic feature of the words, it also dislocates them from their fixed meaning (in the proverb), leaving a sense of displacement in the sentence. The verse that follows ("Deus nao entortou linhas porque escrevia canhoto?") questions any absolute truth or perfection. Drawing from the popular proverb "Deus escreve certo por linhas tortas" ("God works in mysterious ways," literally "God writes straight through crooked lines"), and counting on the principle that readers of Portuguese would 76</page><page sequence="15">already have this proverb embedded in their linguistic competence, the poetic voice goes on to the symbolic level to question the assumption of God as the ultimate writer: "Didn't God bend lines because He was left-handed?". The doubt inscribed leads the reader to re-examine the description of God as the infallible and perfect writer. The "left-handed God" of this poem also bestows the sense of a God who is closer to human nature, a God more capable of understanding and empathizing with human mistakes because of His own sinister side, his own deviation from the norm. Additionally, this "left-handed God" establishes a partnership with the de-centered god described in the poem "Missa Conga" ("the feather-eyed god / who lives at the bottom of Time"). While in "Instrucao do homem pela poesia em seu rigoroso trabalho," God deviates from the ideal norm of perfection, in "Missa Conga" the ex-centric "feather-eyed god" casts a soft look on the world, an image that directly contradicts the Christian description of God, oft-portrayed with piercing, penetrating eyes (for this reason, perhaps, in "Missa Conga," the word god is written in small case). Associated with Time in both poems, the higher symbol of creation and creativity (the indefinite, the biblical beginning, the logos) displays positive human qualities, becoming less frightening, and more tangible and accessible. The images of God (as displayed in these two poems) transgress and subvert the Judeo-Christian description by softening the paradigm of a fearsome, authoritative Almighty and establishing a symbiotic association between humans and God through the transference of a slight physical alterity. In "A instrucao do homem pela poesia em seu rigoroso trabalho," and in all of his poetry, Pereira describes a reality that is arrested and re-invented through language, and remains in a constant dialogue with culture, history, the reader, and with the Brazilian literary tradition. The poetic voice assigns "the fluctuating job of the signified" to the poem, and recommends a "magnifying glass" and a "hammer" if the reader wants to enter the realm of the words, see beyond the historical myopia, or break through the "solid wall" of the text. This part of the poem echoes concerns similar to those present in the poem "Procura da poesia" ("Search for Poetry") by Carlos Drummond de Andrade in which the poetic voice asks the reader: "Trouxeste a chave?" (44) / ["Did you bring the key?" (146)], indicating that meanings are generated by readers as they open locked doors to enter the inner realm of a text. The left-handed God described in this poem also finds a counterpart in Drummond's "o anjo torto" ("the awkward, maladjusted, displaced angel") described in "Poema de sete faces" ("Poem with Seven Faces"). In both texts, the poetic voice questions the Christian idea of perfection attributed to God and angels. In addition, Pereira's poem echoes Machado de Assis' chapter "A 6pera" ("The Opera") in Dom Casmurro in which the narrator blames God for the natural catastrophes, and social, racial and economic inequities in the world. In that chapter, the narrator considers God's lack of commitment to his creation, His insufficient supervision of the Devil's projects, and His carelessness in analyzing the librettos that Satan presents to Him (that were to be staged in the planet earth) to be the main causes of so many tragedies. Although Pereira's text differs in structure and content from Machado's, both authors criticize and dispute the idea of an omnipotent, absolutely perfect God. Therefore, following Machado's heritage, Pereira's poem questions the idea of a mainstream God who has been described and portrayed in the Judeo-Christian tradition as right-handed, a self-certifying absolute, anchored in the concept of "the ultimate referent."'6 By rewriting the proverb and transforming it into a question, humorous and irreverent in tone ("Didn't God bend lines because he was left handed?"), the poetic voice in Pereira's poem (like Machado's irreverent narrator in Dom Casmurro) transgresses theological norms and subverts expected linguistic meanings. In "A instrucao do homem em seu rigoroso trabalho," Pereira uses one of his poetic trademarks (the subversion of established connotations of words) to question the Barbosa 77</page><page sequence="16">Luso-Brazilian Review, 37/1 concept of stable meanings in culture and language. While the invocation of natural elements in this poem (caterpillars, earth, rain, weeping grass, morning, night), the use of popular proverbs, and the poet's concern about writing constitute powerful metaphorical elements, the author's engagement with and dependency on the reader establishes a set of shifting semantic meanings. The poetic voice invites the "traveling reader" to embark on the process of his creation, to populate the poem with his/her "own semantic and expressive intention"'7 which, in turn, disempowers the author of creative supremacy. The poetic voice acknowledges the reader as a participant in the production of the text, delegating to him/her the status of a co-creator as he/she produces meanings through the aesthetic manipulations of language. The space opened for the reader's participation unfolds a web of signification as it rejects the possibility of a fixed meaning and/or a "correct" interpretation of the text. By opening a space for the reader to participate, the author courts him/her, transforming the text into a seductive device. By partially transferring to the reader the responsibility of re- creating the poem and having the poet dependent on the reader, the poetic voice positions itself, not as the inventor, but rather as a co-creator. Thus, the creative dynamism of the text is extended to the reader who also manipulates the craftsmanship and partakes in the creation of meanings. While history and ethnicity are part of the cultural background from which Pereira draws most of his thematic sources, he is less concerned about becoming part of a specific cultural/literary group, or simply rewriting in literature the omissions, pauses, and silences of official history. As discussed, while popular culture, the rural speech in Minas Gerais, and bucolic situations have a noticeable presence in his writing, his poetic production does not simply mirror or reproduce those elements, but rather articulates several discourses whose echoes are duplicated in the interstices of history and culture. His poems enunciate the symbolic representation of Afro-Brazilian cultures, while pointing to the fragmented and individualized process of crystallizing the poetic form. As Pereira imprints the past in the strategies of a re-invented poetic language, he engraves a cultural palimpsest and questions the all-encompassing definition of an "Afro-Brazilian identity." His poetry indicates that although epistemological desire is, at times "locked in the hermeneutical cycle,"'8 the fluidity of language creates a gateway which allows for the construction of new linguistic, historical, and cultural meanings. In addition, his poetic production points to the impracticality of attempting to pin down a single moment when the ontological grounding occurs in historical time, in cultural heritage, or in language. The close readings of Pereira's poems presented in this study do not constitute an attempt to create a "stable" meaning for his texts, the desire to establish norms for their interpretation, or the longing to define the author's intention. The readings in this study simply introduce one way of interpreting these poems, providing a sample of the multitude of meanings that this author often presents in his poetry, and revealing how he bridges the gap between the historical and poetic text. The discussions included in this analysis constitute samples of how Pereira disavows one single vantage point from which the reader, or the poet himself, can manipulate and control the text. The intertextual relationships examined in this study serve to exemplify the articulation (as well as the displacements) of the literary tradition. The references to Carlos Drummond de Andrade and Machado de Assis do not have the purpose of validating Pereira's poems, or intend to discuss matters of influence, impact, and indebtedness, but rather to establish a literary dialogue with these authors. The references to other texts address questions of intertextuality (as defined by Julia Kristeva and Roland Barthes), revealing the proximity of aesthetic images, and the constantly re-invented literary tradition. The connections established between Pereira's anthropological research and his poetic production aimed at linking related fields of study, and analyzing how he presents a disjunctive temporal and spatial Afro-Brazilian reality within the manifolds of historically signifying discourses. This reading of selected poems 78</page><page sequence="17">by Pereira also analyzes the different ways in which he endows, re-articulates, and anchors "multi-accentual"19 discourses in his poetry, presenting the heterogeneity of historical representations, and the tapestry of design that constitutes the cultural practices of African origin in Minas Gerais.
