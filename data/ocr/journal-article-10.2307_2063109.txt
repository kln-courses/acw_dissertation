Heath &amp; Company, 1974. 193 pp. $12.50 cloth. DEBORAH S. DAVID Northeastern University, Boston This book taught me more about the mating habits of frogs than I ever wanted to know. It seems that among a species of South Amer- ican frogs, the female lays her eggs one at a time. But the male, while fertilizing the egg, allows her to do a forward flip, and then deposits the egg on her back as she returns beneath the male. I'm not sure what relevance this esoteric bit of information has, especially since little attempt is made to relate it to human behavior. Perhaps Alex Comfort could help out on this score if he ever writes Even More Joy, etc. This is but one example of the kinds of work one encounters in this collection of twelve papers from a conference sponsored by the Mental Hygiene Institute in Montreal in 1972. With a few exceptions, the papers are useless or worse; many of the articles con- tain fatuous statements that, if nothing else, add unintended humor to the book. What is one to make of the statement that "the Judeo-</page><page sequence="2">FAMILY AND INTIMATE LIFESTYLES 769 Christian ethic that 'man has domain' is the anthropomorphic conceptual form of a drive that rules the lives of all species of animals"? More serious however, is that value judg- ments run throughout the book in the guise of scholarship, such as, in an article on the Caribbean family, "The black man must break out of these irresponsibile sexual patterns and must stop cluttering the islands with his illegit- imate children." The editors in their brief introductions are similarly guilty. "Of course we will find our- selves being very cautious in interpreting animal behavior in terms of what human be- havior ought to be" (italics mine). Further- more, their organization does not elucidate any particular point of view, and merely tries, unsuccessfully, to impose order on a wide range of subjects. Most of the better papers are only relatively better-they lack value judgments and are coherent-but they are still lightweight and don't contribute anything new to the area. One notable exception is Murray Straus's ar- ticle on family violence, which is a concise summary of some of the issues relating to that topic. It is customary to conclude a review with suggestions for the uses of the book. I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn, or wants one's students to learn that "the main force that transformed the traditional family into the contemporary conjugal or nuclear family was the rapid industrialization that took place . . . during the nineteenth century," that "tribal and peasant women, while not militant feminists, would turn their subordi- nate position upside down if they could," and that one reaction to the increased confidence of women (due to the Women's Liberation Movement) is that "many men turn to homo- sexuality."</page></plain_text>
