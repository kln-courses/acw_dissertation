Maurer, Director, The University of Michigan Museum of Art , and Associate Professor, Department of the History of Art, Ann Arbor, Michigan The tribes of the Great Lakes and their neighbors in the Woodlands, Prairies, and eastern Plains have a rich cultural heritage whose visual arts utilize a variety of abstract, symbolic, and representational forms expressed in many techniques, materials, and styles. As was common in Native American cultures, most adult men and women of these tribes created various kinds of objects as an integral part of their daily existence. Because of the beauty of many of these objects, those who have studied them have isolated what we perceive to be the finest examples into a separate category considered "art." While Native American societies had a highly developed sense of aesthetics, neither their cultural practices nor their language separated the forms and functions of art from the basic patterns of their lives. For this reason the majority of objects that we categorize as Native American art have a utilitarian function or are based on utilitarian prototypes. In Native American culture, social functions and the division of labor were determined by gender, with men and women being responsible for different aspects of daily life, from food production to the creation of clothing and household objects. In the Great Lakes and their contiguous areas, the technique of carving in stone or wood was exclusively practiced by men. Stone was primarily used in the ancient tradition of pipe carving that developed abstract shapes as well as an extraordi- narily rich repertoire of animal and anthropomorphic forms. Wood, however, was utilized for the production of a great variety of objects. In order to better understand the common characteristics of these wooden objects we can briefly describe them as being functional in purpose, minimal in their sculptural form, and very often associated with spiritual or religious uses. These categories of approach will be referred to in our discussion of individual objects. The Detroit Institute of Arts is fortunate that the area of wooden sculpture is well represented in the Chandler/Pohrt collection. It features fine examples of most major categories of sculpture including crooked knives and mirror boards (see Penney and Stouffer, "Horse Imagery in Native American Art," pp. • 18-25) as well as figures, spoons, quirts, sewing awls, bead loom heddles, feather box lids, flutes, prescription sticks, pipe stems, and maple sugar molds.1 Some of these objects, such as the feather box lids or maple sugar molds, are carved in various depths of engraved line or bas-relief, but the majority are three- dimensional formal expressions-sculp- tures in the round created to be used, handled, and appreciated in a tactile as well as a visual manner. The basic characteristics of this type of Great Lakes sculpture are beautifully exemplified by three other kinds of objects in the collection: drumbeaters, clubs, and bowls. Through an examination of these wooden pieces we can come to a fuller appreciation of some aspects of the aesthetics and iconography of this important Native American artistic tradition. Drumbeaters and clubs A classic Chippewa wooden Drumbeater exemplifies the salient qualities of Great Lakes sculpture (fig. 4). It consists of a handle that gently narrows toward an angled head used to strike a skin- covered drum. The elegant proportions of the minimal form are heightened by the expertly carved and smoothly finished surface which shows no evidence of tool marks. The calculated visual harmonies are also expressed in the fine physical balance of the object when it is held in the hand. The man who carved this drumbeater was also able to integrate its functional purpose with a specific spiritual image, that of the loon, a bird which figures promi- nently in the mythical structure of the Midéwiwin society rituals in which this object was used. In many examples of this type, the characteristic features of the loon are expressed solely by the subtle carving of the form.2 Figure 1 (opposite).

Founders Society Purchase (81.116).</page><page sequence="3">In the Chandler/Pohrt example the head of the loon is emphasized by the addition of two brass tacks that represent eyes. By this simple and direct means the artist emphasized congruent parts of the drumbeater as the long neck and beak of the bird. That this minimally conceived form does indeed refer specifically to the loon as an important spiritual being can be seen in the Midé origin tale in which the loon "reached the entrance to the manito lodge, ran in as fast as possible, circling like a Midé . . . stretched his head over [the drum], and there appeared a drumstick."3 The sculptural and symbolic qualities of the drumbeater can also be seen in other types of utilitarian and ritual objects. One of the most common weapons of the Great Lakes warrior was a ball-headed club carved from a single piece of wood. The fine Chippewa Ball-Headed Club (fig. 3) follows the typical form in which an articulated handle carved from a long, flat shaft curves into the rounded striking head. As these were functional weapons designed for hand-to-hand combat, the wood was carefully selected from that segment of a thick branch attached to the tree trunk, thus assuring that the curving form had structural strength based on the grain of the wood. Although the club was carved from a single piece of wood, the elements of handle, shaft, and head are clearly articulated and differentiate the individual character of each part. As in the case of the drumbeater, carvers of ball-headed clubs often extended the functional form of the object to repre- sent the head of an animal. In many examples, such as the Ottawa Ball- Headed Club (fig. 5), the formal differ- ence is very subtle and involves the further articulation of the area where the ball joins the shaft of the club so that a generalized representation of an animal holding a ball in its open mouth is created. A Miniature Ball-Headed Club (fig. 6) from the Chandler/Pohrt collection made for use in a sacred war bundle shows another version of this motif. In this example the head of the animal also features a stylized ear whose curve reflects the shape and proportion of the open mouth. That these minimal forms represent animals can be established by the many clubs in which the animal head is represented in a more realistic manner. An outstanding example of this clearly zoomorphic type is the Iroquois Ball- Headed Club (fig. 7) collected by Milford G. Chandler in 1919. Not only has the artist convincingly expressed the three- dimensional form of an animal's head, he has also given it an unusual amount of descriptive detail in the carved and painted ears, eyes, nose, and teeth.4 While there is little documentary evidence concerning the meaning of these animal forms, it is generally assumed that they are metaphors that either express the physical strength and prowess of animals such as bears or felines or refer to the spiritual power possessed by these animals in their important roles in the Native American mythological structure. Carved bowls The largest category of wooden sculpture from the Great Lakes and surrounding areas in the Detroit Institute of Arts' collection consists of a superb group of carved bowls. Bowls made from a variety of woods served as food containers for everyday use and for special feasts. Wooden bowls were also used in versions of a gambling game played with sets of dice-like objects.5 Until the late nineteenth century, the carved wooden food bowl was commonly found in every Native American house- hold of the Great Lakes region. In about 1695, the French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac reported that at feasts among the Ottawa of Mackinac Island "the custom of the country is for each person to have his dish."6 This custom was widespread and was also reported among the Huron and the Ojibwa (also known as the Chippewa);7 in 1943 one observer commented that "at (Ojibwa) feasts every man carried his own wooden spoon and bowl to which the food was transferred with a large wooden ladle from the common cooking pot, a practice that continues to be followed on many of the reservations today with the tin pail and spoon."8 References from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries describe the number and quality of "ye woden trayes &amp; dishes they ate their meals in"9 and report that the Iroquois and Delaware also manufac- tured wooden bowls for trade to other native groups or to the whites.10 In the New England area it was noted that the Natives "have dainty wooden bowls amongst them; and these are disposed by bartering one with the other and are but in certain parts of the Country made, Figure 3.

Most Great Lakes-area bowls that have survived the vicissitudes of time were made from large burls or knots that formed in the trunks of certain hard- woods such as ash or maple. These formations have an especially dense and tight curving grain pattern which is difficult to carve yet produces a very durable object resistant to the cracking and splitting that often occurs in pieces made from straight-grained woods. From the earliest times of European contact, these wooden burls were used for bowls. Gabriel Sagard Theodat, a Frenchman who visited the Great Lakes tribes in the years 1623-24, observed that the men of the region made bowls that they carved from knots of wood using beaver incisors, a natural wood- cutting tool also used by the carvers of the Northwest Coast.12 Other native tools and techniques used in bowl carving have also been identified: "before the introduction of steel knives, the wooden utensils were made by charring and scraping with bone and stone instruments."13 Perhaps the best description of this process was written by Chandler: The old methods have served well enough but they were so time consuming and laborious. For making a wooden bowl, a burl had to be split off a tree with wedges of deer antler, roughly shaped by burning and 9 Figure 5.

Then the inside had to be burned out with hot coals a little at a time, scraped with flint after each burning and wet clay applied at just the right time as the bowl thinned down. By grinding with coarse, then finer sandstone and polishing a smooth surface with deerskin and fine sand, the bowl was finally finished.14 This method persisted until the advent of steel tools, the most efficient of which was the curved-blade draw knife known as a "crooked knife," which was used to finish the carving and add sculptural detail.15 While some of these wooden bowls were made without any sculptural decoration, a high proportion of the bowls that survive in museum and private collec- tions are embellished with carved rims using various representational and symbolic motifs. Bowls with these sculptural forms are generally assumed to be related to important social and religious functions, although there is a surprising lack of documentary evidence that one can cite to prove this sup- position. The Bureau of American Ethnology's Handbook of American Indians notes that " wooden bowls used for religious purposes were often decorated (with) . . . figures of sacred animals, whose supposed spiritual power had relations to the uses of the vessel."16 The Handbook also states that "the Micmac accorded supernatural powers to certain of their bowls, and thought that water standing over night in gaming bowls would reveal by its appearance past, present, and future events. Some bowls were supposed to have mysterious powers which would affect the person eating or drinking from them."17 Other commentators concur that bowls "designed for the Grand Medicine Lodge ceremonies, the Dream Dance Religion, and other important religious functions were often made from hard tree burls and decorated with human or animal forms."18 While it has been recognized that "the more elaborate animal forms may have been used for ceremonial purposes," it also has been noted that "we have no evidence that they were so employed."19 Given the numbers of decorated bowls that were reported to have been used in the Great Lakes region from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries, it is all the more surprising and frustrating that so little is known about their actual use. This gap in our knowledge is evident when we review specific studies of such basic Great Lakes religious structures as the Midéwiwin. Although scholars have made frequent references to the many feasts that were an integral element of the Midé system, the bowls that were 10 Figure 8.

In the earliest important study of the Midéwiwin Grand Medicine Society, frequent Midé feasts are discussed, but specific references to the types of bowls used are lacking.20 The Native American collections at the Detroit Institute of Arts contain five wooden bowls that incorporate animal images. The largest of these is a very unusual example: a Bowl in the Form of a Beaver (fig. 8). The oblong shape of the bowl corresponds to the general proportions of a young adult beaver lying on its back. Even the short, broad head is carved out and might have functioned as a pouring lip to serve individual guests when this large bowl was used at feasts. The end opposite the head is marked by a realistically carved beaver tail complete with engraved crosshatching that evokes the texture of this part of the animal's body. Signs of wear on the tail suggest that it was ùtilized as a handle to hold or carry the bowl. These anatomical references are completed by indications of the four legs carved in shallow relief on the exterior sides of the bowl. Figure 11. Bowl , Sauk and Fox (Tama, Iowa), 19th century; wood, 1. 42.6 x w. 35.9 x h. 22.9 cm (16% x 14% x 9 in.). Founders Society Purchase (81.643). 11 This object is a prime example of the sculptural conception of Great Lakes animal effigy bowls in which the carved elements that represent the animal are not merely attached to the bowl as additive decoration but are sculpturally and conceptually integrated with the form of the functional object. This congruence of forms establishes the bowl as the body of the animal and clarifies our perception of the total object as a sculptural metaphor.21 These animal effigy bowls were made in a wide variety of styles, as can be seen when we compare three Winnebago bowls. The first example is a finely carved Bowl (fig. 9) in which the long neck and beak of a bird are joined to a concave section of slightly oval shape. The carved forms minimally indicate the basic structure of the bird's neck and head with the only detail being a slight groove around the end of the beak to articulate the mouth. A very different style of effigy is represented by a Bowl (fig. 2) in which the carver has added forms to the rim that symbolize the wings and tail of the bird, thereby heightening the metaphor of the bowl as the body of the animal. The raised tail is balanced by the long head and beak, whose tip ends in a downward curve similar to that of the loon. Because of their small scale it is clear that neither of these two bowls was used to hold food. Traditionally called medicine bowls, they are assumed to have been used by Midé shamans to give medicine to their patients in the curing ceremonies that were a central feature of Great Lakes culture. The bird, an important Midé symbol associated with</page><page sequence="7">the powers of the sky, appears on engraved birch bark Midé scrolls, and its form was used for the carved effigies that surmounted the four poles of the Midé lodge.22 The long-beaked bird most commonly mentioned in Midé myths is the loon, so we might assume that, as in the case of the Drumbeater (fig. 4), this bird was the inspiration for those two effigy bowls. A third Winnebago effigy Bowl (fig. 10) demonstrates an even more abstracted sculptural vision. In this extremely minimal example the animal forms have been reduced to a short neck and a triangular head with no indications of anatomical detail. The form is so generalized as to make it impossible to identify it as a specific animal, yet its shape is certainly zoomorphic. A fine old Sauk and Fox effigy Bowl (fig. 11) in the Chandler/Pohrt collection exemplifies yet another formal concep- tion of the bowl as a sculptural metaphor for an animal. In this type the effigy head faces the interior of the bowl. The smooth, generalized curves of the animal's head and neck are articulated into shoulders that join the rim. On the outer edge of the rim a carved band begins at the shoulder of the effigy and continues around the circumference to the opposite end of the oval, where it rises in a gentle curve to indicate the animaFs tail. While the features of this effigy are minimal, the curve of the head and its pointed "mouth" are very similar to the graphic symbols of birds engraved on sacred Midé scrolls.23 Visual evidence from these scrolls suggests that this avian figure may well represent the Thunderbird, an eagle- like bird of great spiritual power whose image was frequently found on Midé birch bark scrolls, woven into bag designs (see Phillips, "Dreams and Designs: Iconographie Problems in Great Lakes Twined Bags," pp. 26-37), or embroidered in porcupine quills on leather pouches.24 The orientation of the head toward the interior of the bowl (or the tail) estab- lishes another perceptual metaphor in which the arms or wings of the animal can be conceived as extending from the shoulders to form the sides of the bowl. We can therefore perceive this type of effigy bowl as the sculptural 12 Figure 12. Bowl , Yankton or Eastern Sioux, c. 1850; wood with brass tacks, h. 13 X diam. 34 cm (5% x 13% in.).

Anthropomorphic bowls Wooden feast bowls from the Great Lakes and surrounding areas were also carved in a variety of styles using anthropomorphic effigies in degrees of representation that range from examples with detailed physiognomy to ones that feature highly abstracted and conven- tionalized symbols. The Detroit Institute of Arts is fortunate that the Chandler/ Pohrt collection contains a large number of extremely fine examples representing this sculptural tradition. The origins of the anthropomorphic effigy bowls can be traced back to prototypes of the Mississippian period (about 700-1200). In a ceramic Effigy Vessel (fig. 13) found in Illinois, a short, thick neck supports a round anthropo- morphic head with a flat face and three- dimensional renditions of eyes, nose, and mouth. The pair of large ears placed on the top of the head is similar to those appearing in depictions of bears, dogs, or other animals. This figure looks toward the interior of the vessel and is balanced by a curving projection that extends beyond the opposite rim, like the tail forms found on animal effigies. That this sculptural form was continued into historical Native American cultures is clearly seen when we compare the ceramic vessel to similar examples such as a Yankton or Eastern Sioux wooden effigy Bowl (fig. 12). The planes of the face in this example were subtly carved to achieve an expressive presence emphasized by the large staring brass tack eyes. As in the ceramic effigy vessel, the ears of the figure are placed in a vertical position where they look more like horns or animal ears than their human counter- . parts. The figure's neck flows in an even line to where it joins the rim of the bowl about ten centimeters (four inches) from the head; this raised portion of the rim is reflected on the other end by a similar form. The same concept of arms encir- cling the bowl, as evidenced in the Sauk and Fox animal effigy example (fig. 11), can be applied to these anthropomorphic bowls. The figure can be perceived as holding the bowl and its contents in a gesture that offers it to the user. In comparison to the more disciplined precision of the Yankton or Eastern Sioux example, another Eastern Sioux effigy Bowl (fig. 14 and cover) was carved in a freer curvilinear style that softens the features of the face and the shape of the bowl. In this extraordinary piece of sculpture, the artist has reduced the anthropomorphic face to a broad oval dominated by deep hollow sockets that frame and accentuate the dull yellow gleam of the brass tack eyes. The image is one of arresting elemental power, despite the fundamental differ- ences between the modern world and that of the traditional Native Americans who created and used this object in sacred ceremonies.25 Anthropomorphic bowls were also produced with pairs of effigies facing each other as seen in a very fine Bowl (fig. 19) from the Sauk and Fox. The generalized curving forms of the two faces have the same intense stare that characterizes the two bowls just discussed. One of the most distin- guishing elements of the Sauk and Fox piece is the manner in which the artist indicated the chests of the figures as they swell out into the interior. The effect is of the two figures growing out of the wall of the bowl, an extraordinary tour de force of artistic genius and technique. An even more unusual display of anthropomorphic imagery can be seen in a unique Chippewa example that features Figure 15. Midé Effigy Figures.

Here the figures are constructed of simple geometric shapes: circles for the heads, triangles for the bodies, and rectangles for the arms. Each pair of figures is joined at the shoulder, their bodies and arms formed by the negative spaces created by cutting three identical triangular shapes through the wall at the line of the rim. The figures arch backwards following the curve of the wall of the bowl. While the resulting angle integrates the figures with the larger form, it also adds a sense of movement and strain as we imagine the figures holding a large, heavy wooden feast bowl between them. As in all of these bowls, the minimal sculptural forms are reinforced by carefully controlled carving and finishing techniques which leave no evidence of tool marks. Questions of use While conclusive documentary evidence linking these effigy bowls to sacred rituals such as the Midéwiwin is lacking, the generally held theories as to their spiritual and religious functions quoted earlier can be supported by a compari- son of the images on the bowls with graphic and sculptural images that are securely related to the Midé rites. Anthropomorphic figures of various types are frequently found on the sacred Midé scrolls, where they were part of the symbolic system of mnemonic aids that describe the mystic songs, rituals, and spiritual entities of the society.26 In the majority of scroll examples, the figures do not represent human beings but powerful spirits, or manitos, which are personified by anthropomorphic forms. A circle is used to describe the head and curvilinear outlines or elongated triangles define the bodies of these 14 highly stylized figures. In some cases these figures do represent human beings, specifically the various Midé officials or the patient/initiate for whom the ceremony is being performed.27 Anthropomorphic figures carved in wood were also used in Ojibwa Midé ceremonies.28 Two distinct sculptural styles of these figures have been Figure 16.

Such similarities in form and conception demonstrate that the anthropomorphic figures found on wooden bowls have definite stylistic relationships to the graphic and sculptural anthropomorphic images associated with Midé ceremonies. This evidence allows us to continue to assume that the bowls have spiritual associations related to the Midéwiwin and its complex series of associated ritual events. Abstract Designs The idea has been put forward that certain abstract designs worked into the rim of bowls were symbolic references to animals; for example, a seventeenth- century Wampanoag bowl whose 4 'handle, or projection rising from the rim, seems to represent the convention- alized head of an animal, the small projections at either side indicating the ears . . . the two perforations (eyes) probably served for the passage of a cord by which the vessel could be sus- pended."29 Our examination of the bowls in the Chandler/Pohrt collection and elsewhere supports such an iconographie identification and, as we will observe in the following examples, this identifica- tion can shed new light on other wooden objects. The design described on the Wampanoag bowl is a common motif found in variations on many bowls. Two superbly crafted examples of the type in the Chandler/Pohrt collection are a low round Chippewa Bowl (fig. 16) and an Ottawa Bowl (fig. 17) with higher sides and a more ovoid form. Both feature opposing pairs of designs in which the rim curves upward, then angles in to form a horizontal shoulder. From this point the form rises vertically and is then truncated by another horizontal line. When we compare this form to a repre-</page><page sequence="11">sentational image of an effigy figure such as that of the Yankton or Eastern Sioux Bowl (fig. 12) or the Sauk and Fox double effigy Bowl (fig. 19), the figurai qualities of the bowl become more obvious, and, although the earlier sup- position that this geometric design was symbolic of a figure is confirmed, it seems more likely that the designs are symbols of anthropomorphic manito spirits rather than animals. The Chandler/Pohrt collection contains another Eastern Sioux Bowl (fig. 20) with a different variation of this theme. This beautiful oval burl bowl also has a matched pair of forms whose outline is considerably less angular than those just described. In this example the outline curves directly upward from the rim to indicate the top of an animal or anthro- pomorphic manito head complete with pointed ears. Other variants of this general motif are seen in bowls in the Chandler/Pohrt collection from the Pawnee (figs. 21 and 22), and the Eastern Sioux (fig. 18). Double-lobed types such as these Pawnee examples are versions of the manito image in which the ears have become the sole distinguishing characteristic of the head. This association can be supported by comparing these forms to more fully articulated examples such as a Sisseton Sioux bowl in the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York, which has the same large curving ear forms with the addition of a face complete with nose, mouth, and brass tack eyes.30 If we accept that these double-lobed designs are anthropomor- phic, might the pairs of perforations in the Pawnee and Eastern Sioux Bowls (figs. 22 and 18) represent the eyes of an abstracted face? In his study of wooden bowls, Willoughby assumed that these holes were used to hold cords by which the bowl was suspended.31 However, close examination of the holes in these two bowls shows none of the indications of wear that would result from years of rub- bing by a fiber or leather cord. This fact would seem to corroborate the theory that these designs are anthropomorphic. The wooden bowls of the Chandler/Pohrt collection constitute a major resource for the study of Native American art from the Great Lakes region.32 It is hoped that future investigations into the ethnographic and historical record will provide further evidence of their actual use in tribal culture and an understand- ing of the iconography of their forms. In terms of artistic excellence, these bowls represent a significant achievement within the history of Native American wooden sculpture. 16 Figure 20.

The only visual evidence of the use of carved wooden bowls is found in a drawing of a Midé priest extracting sickness from a patient by sucking through a bone tube. The artist depicted a wooden bowl, which is on the ground next to the figures, with rim decoration; unfortunately the drawing is not sufficiently detailed to render the exact nature of the carved elements. Moreover, we have little evidence of the reliability of the artist as an accurate observer. 21. Two beaver effigy bowls of a different style were collected in about 1797 among the Kaekaskia of Illinois by a Judge Turner. Both show the animal standing on its four legs. One example is in the University Museum, Philadelphia (Feder 1971 [note 1]: no. 129); the other in the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts (Maurer 1977 [note 1]: no. 130). 22.
