Kimbler While robotics as a technology is modern, we can look to science fiction and mythology for inspirations for today's and tomorrow's products. Indeed, one of the earliest references to robots describes what is now at the frontier of modern technology-the golden maidens of Vulcan (Dur- ant, 1939). These servants, according to myth, were built by Vulcan to assist him after he became crippled. With specialized robots finding ready use in industry, we are finding a rise in the attention received by the personal robot. Appropriate Applications One of the most apt descriptions of a robot for use in education is found in "Strange Playfellow" (Asimov, 1950). The robot, named "Rob- bie" by the child to whom he was assigned, was capable of almost all desirable functions except speech. Robbie was anthropomorphic, capa- ble of perceiving his environment, capable of motion and dexterity, and capable, due to his "positronic brain," of learning and reasoning. En- dowed as he was with Asimov's famous "Three Laws of Robotics" (1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First D. L.

A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law); Robbie was not only safe for use with humans, but contributed to the safety of humans within his range. As a playmate, Robbie performed functions that are found to be desir- able in robots today. In education, these functions can be put in two categories. First, these functions can be thought of as auxiliary to edu- cation. They provide novel interaction with the student, they aid in motivation, in short they act as an extension of the teacher. These func- tions can be found in many robots and robotic educational systems today, and have been put to productive use in special education. The use of robots as teaching aids ranges from preschool to university, from attention mechanisms to teaching science and mathematics. The limits to the effective use of these robots are essentially the limits established by the creativity of the teaching professionals using them. Second, the robot as an extension of self is a very different matter, being controlled by the student to meet the student's personal needs and objectives. The driving functions in the specification of this robot are the student's mode of control and the functionality in successfully fulfilling the student's commands. Meeting the requirements of these functions demands a robot capable of a very high level of sophistication in its logic and its actions-a level that is not present in currently avail- able robots. Potential Uses in Education At first, the idea of robots in the classroom might seem unusual or impractical. In reality, robots are here and beginning to be used in edu- cation. This technological marvel is being integrated into educational systems because of attributes it shares with modern manufacturing sys- tems and microcomputers. Modern manufacturing techniques have significantly shortened the span of time from idea to product, the innovation time. A new product requires demand, technology, and will to produce. Drawing as they have from proven industrial systems, educational robots have been and con- tinue to be developed. Their proliferation closely follows that of micro- computers. Beginning as scarce novelties, their potential has been recognized. They are now present in many shapes and sizes, some highly specialized for educational use. The robots are here, as are the microcomputers. We are again faced with the questions of how to utilize the technology, how to blend it with the curriculum, and how the curriculum should be modified to reflect technological change. As stated above, the uses of robots can be cate- 68</page><page sequence="3">Robots and Special Education: The Robot as Extension of Self gorized as teacher-initiated and student-initiated. Curriculum issues, while highly significant, must be resolved as the technology stabilizes. Teacher-initiated uses of robots closely follow uses of other, presently more traditional tools. Robots may engage attention through their nov- elty and physical attractiveness. They may be used to illustrate or rein- force material from other sources. Robots in this case are very similar to other educational aids, and their use applies to the entire spectrum of students. Another teacher-initiated use is that of demonstration. In this category robots may be used to present their own qualities and characteristics, to present modern technology in the classroom. Again, their use applies to the broad spectrum of students. In this case, however, students in special education groups may have more to gain. Robotics is changing the work environment significantly. Students who cope with this change will ob- viously benefit. Not so obvious, however, are the changes that may allow the handicapped entry into new job classifications. The automation of a physically demanding process reduces the emphasis on strength and mobility; increased reliance on computing and communication could actually give the handicapped student a potential advantage. In special education, the student-initiated uses of the robot are most significant, due to the implied potential changes in quality of life as well as impact on education. It is the robot at the command of the student that gives the handicapped student the intangible feeling that is so taken for granted-control of environment. This is the logical extension of mainstreaming, in that instructional method is geared to the class as a whole. Compensation for handicapping condition is initiated and con- trolled by the student. We have two major categories of use, and two different types of robot. The educational robot is present in many forms and has substantial potential for education. The robotic extension of self, providing en- hanced interaction and control for the student, is still in the develop- mental stages. Its potential impact for education could be even greater for the handicapped, and its application outside the classroom even more beneficial. The consideration of such a robot raises several questions. First, what characteristics must such a robot possess? In the broadest sense, the robot as extension of self should operate to assist the handicapped stu- dent to become as nearly fully functioning in the student's environment as possible, to negate the disability from the handicapping condition. Should such a robot exist, how would it differ from a similar robot in use by non-handicapped students? It would differ very little, perhaps only in adaptive input/output devices required by some conditions. Its use, of course, would be dictated by a more serious need, but its char-</page><page sequence="4">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION Toward the Advancement of Microcomputer Technology in Special Education acteristics would make it useful by the general population. The question remains concerning the technological requirements of the robot. The balance of this paper deals with these requirements and practical aspects of achieving them. The Robotic Extension Usefulness by Handicapping Condition The main handicapping conditions that would be alleviated by the use of robots are those that limit mobility, dexterity, and interaction with environment. The use of the robot in these cases is simply an extension of present philosophies in education. Whether the basis is mainstream- ing, cost reduction, or understanding, the result is the assistance of the student to function in an ordinary classroom, as they will be expected to function in an ordinary environment as adults. The robot, then, can be thought of as providing missing or impaired human functions, under direction of the student. The first major category of conditions consists of orthopedically hand- icapped, multi-handicapped, and other health impairment. These con- ditions all, to some extent, limit mobility and dexterity, and thus limit interaction with environment. Remote control devices have been used to some extent, and industrial robots have been used in research envi- ronments to perform limited functions such as serving meals. These cases, however, require modification of the environment as well as the use of the robot. Ideally, the robot would perform its functions by inter- acting with existing environmental controls and by performing services for the student with a minimum of modification of the environment, since this modification cannot be maintained outside the controlled area. By designing a more generalized system for control by the student, the accessible environment is broadened. The second major category consists of visual impairment and deaf/ blind. Obviously, the robot in this case would provide sensory interac- tion. It would act as a mobile, dextrous adaptive device, allowing the student to perceive the environment and to have the option of directly interacting with it or directing the robot to assist in the physical interac- tion. For example, selecting and loading a cassette tape in an uncon- trolled environment can be a difficult task. With a fully functioning robot, however, the blind student could not only achieve it, but would have several options to exercise, depending on the extent of assistance de- sired. The deaf/blind student would require more complicated input/ output devices to perform physical tasks, but the working of the robot would be the same. 70</page><page sequence="5">Robots and Special Education: The Robot as Extension of Self Within these two categories are found the primary common character- istics in the robot extension. These are mobility, dexterity, payload ca- pacity, sensory capability, and intelligence. These characteristics are presently found, singly or in limited combinations, in existing robots. Mobility and dexterity, for example, are found in many educational robots. Intelligence and limited sensory capability are found in many microcomputers and some robot systems. Payload, to the extent neces- sary to be useful to the handicapped, presently exists only in industrial robots. It is in the combination of these characteristics that the useful fully functioning robot is defined. Performance Characteristics What is required in the fully functioning robotic extension approaches the fictional android, or at least an anthropomorphic device capable of interacting with its environment. While the android helper will remain fictional for some time, the functioning of it can be achieved by a con- certed and concentrated effort in developing a robot system based on its requirements, rather than attempting to adapt existing systems. The robotic extension idea is not a revamped industrial robot, nor is it a modified educational robot, although it shares characteristics with both. What is required is a generalized system, without the inherent design compromises that are made when a robot is designed for a more limited specific purpose. One of the basic requirements is mobility. Mobility in this case is not simply motion, but motion under internal control to achieve external commands. The motion should be smooth, at speeds ranging from very slow to somewhat in excess of a normal walking pace. Due to its opera- tion in an uncontrolled environment, the mobility system will require a sophisticated control and sensory system in order to adapt. One of the most severe physical limits on present mobile robots is payload. For effective operation, payload can be defined in terms of books and grocery bags. The typical grocery bag can be loaded with up to 30 pounds of goods, and the robot should be capable of carrying this load as well as gaining control of it and disposing of it. Manipulation of large loads can be expected to occur near the body, while small loads of up to five pounds, such as a book, should be manipulated with some dexterity at arm's length. Dexterity is required to manipulate the environment and objects in it, as well as performing simple maintenance needs of the student. For these purposes, at least one arm is required, and it should be capable of at least six degrees of freedom in its motions in order to begin the approximate human arm motions. A grasping device is also necessary. This hand should have at least two independent and continuously con- 71</page><page sequence="6">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION Toward the Advancement of Microcomputer Technology in Special Education trollable fingers with an independent opposable thumb. For fine motions and actions requiring high precision, the hand and arm should be ca- pable of detecting exerted force as well as having a sense of touch. The control of the hand should be assisted by a vision system within the robot and simple binary detectors within the hand itself. The intelligence of the robot is one of the critical factors in its perform- ance. It must receive and transmit information through its sensory ap- paratus. It must coordinate basic arm motion with its command and sensory inputs. It must be programmed at a sufficiently high level to allow the user to command it in a conversational mode. Finally, it must perform these functions with near simultaneity and little perceptible hesitation while continuing to learn and adapt to its environment and its user. The second critical factor is the combination of power and size neces- sary to perform the necessary functions. For acceptance and practical use, the robot must be no larger than an average adult. Power systems must be adequate to achieve the motion and payload requirements as well as power the arm and internal senses and computer. This combi- nation will, to a large extent, determine the bulk and stability of the robot. The robot that meets these requirements is a complex system ap- proaching human capabilities in its functionality. It can move about in its environment, manipulate the environment, and serve the needs of the user. While the robotic extension remains limited in its capabilities, and will not completely replace human assistance in some cases, it meets the basic objective. It vastly improves the ability of the handicapped student to function in an uncontrolled environment, and, just as impor- tant, it provides a sense of control and independence that is highly rewarding. The robot has grown from an educational aid to a part of daily life. The State of the Art While many technological components of the ideal robotic extension exist, we are still a long way from development of an integrated system. The existing systems that come closest to these requirements are the mobile educational robot systems. They have mobility, some dexterity, computer control, and in some cases, sensory capability. In their func- tional capabilities, some existing systems meet all of the objectives, though at a much lower level than what is required. The limitations of existing systems lie in the extent to which they are capable of continuous operation in the uncontrolled environment. In this respect, all systems are lacking in all functions. This is not to criticize these systems; in fact, they perform to their design criteria in an educa- 72</page><page sequence="7">Robots and Special Education: The Robot as Extension of Self tional environment. These design criteria assume factors such as super- vised use, a smooth hard surface, limited power and dexterity needs, and limited reliance on robot senses. What is required for development of the robotic extension is a different orientation toward robot design. Existing robots are designed for specific functions or sets of functions. Adapting these for use as general-purpose systems is asking more than their capabilities provide. For the general- purpose robot to become a reality, its design must be done within con- straints set by its functional requirements, not within constraints set by capabilities of existing segments of the system. This requires research in system segments within an integrated set of design objectives. The Research Agenda Machine Intelligence Several functions of the robot require extensive capability in machine intelligence. This capability is a combination of artificial intelligence, expert systems, and real-time computing. Artificial intelligence and the development of expert systems combine to provide reasoning ability, learning, and the specialized data and its manipulation necessary to interact effectively with the environment. Real-time capability is neces- sary for motion, arm, and sensor control. Sensing capability begins with vision and touch. More specialized senses would include sonar ranging, temperature, and sound. Radio frequencies could be used effectively for communication with external devices such as environmental control or the user's control console. These capabilities presently exist; research needs include packaging, information processing, and the interface and software of the control computer. An interesting concept that has been used in mobile industrial systems is the environmental map. This is a computer analog of the floor space within the environment. The robot locates itself within this map, and thus knows at all times its proximity to objects in the environment. This map, expanded by the system's ability to learn, would be invaluable in assisting the motion algorithms. The motion itself requires substantial computing effort, especially con- sidering that motion may be combined with arm motion and sensory interaction. The computer must find a path and then control the robot's motion along the path. If the path is a new one, there will be substantial reliance on external sensors as well as effort in learning the path for later use. Conversatonal input and output will put severe demands on the com- puter. This mode of control is necessary, however, for effective use. There is no reason to expect the user to be a computer programmer. 73</page><page sequence="8">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION Toward the Advancement of Microcomputer Technology in Special Education Indeed, there is no reason to expect the robot to be controllable by small children who have no knowledge of computer programming. The robot must then respond to natural language commands and must use natural language when it initiates communication with the user. All of these factors depend on the computer's decision-making capac- ity, its sheer computing power. The major research effort in this area is in development of computer software for robot control, sensor infor- mation processing, conversational input and output, and the artificial intelligence component that makes all internal decisions in response to commands and sensor inputs. With the progress that has been made in large scale integrated circuits and the availability of 32-bit microproces- sors, the computer hardware is available. Physical Characteristics Dexterity is one of the most critical physical characteristics. It depends on hand design, arm design, and the real-time computing capability. For fine, precise motions, a closed-loop system will be required. This closed loop will consist of the arm, hand, computer, and sensors that monitor hand operation. For usable dexterity, it is vital that the control loop be closed through the object being handled, not just through the motors driving the hand. Key research areas dealing with dexterity are in the materials in the hand, compact but powerful drive systems, and the coordination achieved through the control computer and the external senses. Mobility is the second critical physical area. For reliable mobility, the robot must have a powerful drive system and be unconstrained by the floor surface. The ability to determine its position is also important; many current models can become "lost" due to slippage on the floor. As with dexterity, mobility requires a compact, powerful power source and close coordination with external senses by the control computer. Integrated Effort The heart of the robot system is the coordination of senses and motion. There are many links between the physical aspects of the robot and the control decisions. For this reason, it is vital that the research and devel- opment of the robot, while it may take place in many labs and in many specialties, be closely coordinated. Given our present state of technol- ogy, all of the functions of the robotic extension are feasible. It is their packaging into a single working unit that is the challenge. As design compromises are made, and they will be, the coordinated effort must insure that changes in one area do not detract from others and that 74</page><page sequence="9">Robots and Special Education: The Robot as Extension of Self design efforts continue to be focused on the overall objective-a fully functional robot that is an extension of the user's mind and body. Practical Considerations Although many things are possible, they have price tags, and it would be foolish to embark on the development of a new robot without consid- ering the price. Related to the price is the level of penetration into the user population. Let us consider two extreme cases of the use of robots. First, assume that every student under PL 94-142 is to be given a robot and that this policy is continued as new students enter the populations. Based on the size of the 1981-82 population of orthopedically handi- capped, multihandicapped, blind, deaf/blind, and other health impaired (Blaschke 1984), and an assumed cost of $10,000 per robot, the initial cost would be $2.5 billion dollars, with succeeding annual costs of $125 million, in addition to research and development costs. At the other extreme, assume that the robots are to be assigned only to teachers specializing in these categories. This cost would be approximately $20 million plus research and development costs. This raises some philosophical questions regarding the proper strat- egy. In the first case, this is a very large expenditure on a very small segment of the total population. Yet it has many advantages in the productive functioning of the handicapped in society. The second case has a much smaller cost, but a much more limited usefulness. There is a philosophical problem with the second case as well. The students could use the robots on a limited basis in school, but would be required to purchase their own. If this were not possible, we would be putting the students into an artificial environment, and training them to cope with it, followed by expecting them to function without a vital part of the environment upon which they would come to rely. It seems almost immoral to teach reliance on a system and then make it practically unavailable. Given that the first case is technologically possible, it is also desirable. Before it can be started, however, research is needed in the economic viability of the program. Cost/benefit analyses need to be done, espe- cially considering the potentially high cost of not embarking on the robot research and development program. Considering the size of the invest- ment, it may be necessary to involve both public and private sector funding sources, especially since the result will be a salable product. Conclusion There is no question as to whether this robotics research will be done. The questions are when will it take place and how will it be accom- 75</page><page sequence="10">PEABODY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION Toward the Advancement of Microcomputer Technology in Special Education plished. Certainly its economic aspects will have much to do with when and how it is done, and this could be used to advantage in bringing this robot into development much earlier than might be thought. Considered only as an aid to the handicapped, this project could be thought too expensive. It is very important to recall, however, that this robot and its counterpart for general use will differ only in adaptive input and output devices, if at all. This puts a very different light on its economic viability, and provides a unique opportunity to the field of special education. Many existing educational systems in special education are either highly specialized for their user populations or are adaptations of systems de- veloped for the general population. This robot system presents an op- portunity for special education to take a leadership role in its development and then make it available to the rest of the world years sooner than it would otherwise come to be.
