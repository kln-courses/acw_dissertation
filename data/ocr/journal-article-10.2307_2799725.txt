<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MARSUPIAL IN NUAULU RITUAL BEHAVIOUR RoY F. ELLEN London School of Economics and Political Science If we are to answer adequately the question why man has a ritual attitude to animals, why values and concepts relating to social relations are underpinled by rules about eating animals, we have to inquire for the society in question why the animals chosen are so appropriate in that context to objectify human sentiments and ideas. (Tambiah I969:457) Studies of symbolism tend to employ and often to confuse two distinguishable analytical procedures. On the one hand there is the dialectical exploration of the relationships and semantics of associated symbols in a single ritual activity, and on the other there is the analysis and exegesis of individual symbols in depth, where they occur with some degree of consistency, on a variety of occasions and in a number of circumstances. Here I am mainly concerned with the second-a para- digmatic approach, but whichever mode is adopted the main analytical problem remains the question of abstraction-that somewhere along the continuum between ethnographic fact and anthropological theory reality is likely to become obscured. This constitutes one of the most basic and persistent difficulties in the study of symbolic systems. The primary function of this article is ethnographic. It attempts to document the use of the marsupial cuscus in the ritual and symbolic behaviour of the Nuaulu, a small group of sedentary swidden cultivators and hunters of south central Seram, eastern Indonesia.' However, it is hoped that it may also contribute to the wider theoretical debate. Thus I try to explain why the cuscus should be chosen for the particular rituals in which it occurs and to see if its employment in these contexts reveals a consistent pattern of semantic referents. Here I am following the tradition begun by Mary Douglas (I957), but whereas she and others (Douglas I966; Leach I964; Bulmer I967) have been primarily interested in the anomalous nature of the animals used in ritual, my concern is with different qualities which make particular animals effective symbols. Indeed, the very animals which might appear to be obvious classificatory anomalies, such as cassowaries and flying-lizards, are totally unimportant to the Nuaulu and are subject to neither avoidance nor prohibition. The central aim of this article is not to investigate Nuaulu animal classification per se. Thus I do not concentrate here on the general problems of classificatory hierarchies, the wide semantic correspondences between animal and ecological categories and human groups or between generalised series from different lexemic domains, nor generally on the question of edibility or the relation between dietary prohibitions and schemes of animal classification as studied by Leach (I964), Tambiah (I969) and Wijewardene (I968). This is not because I think these matters unimportant, on the contrary; but because I regard it as being of equal importance to investigate in depth the semantic load and the cultural and classificatory context of a single species and to describe in appropriate detail particular semantic correla- tions between single items (in this case, man and cuscus) from different classes. I am</page><page sequence="2">224 MAN, JUNE I972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 therefore not so much concerned with outlining a wide variety of elaborate sociological dimensions on this theme as with the actual mechanism of the 'con- vertibility of messages' between two items of otherwise different semantic orders. Cuscus natural history and Nuaulu taxonomies 2 The land mammals of Seram are exceedingly few in number, the most reliable estimates recording only eighteen definite recognised species and eleven genera. Chiroptera (bats), however, are relatively numerous, with approximately twenty- four authentic biological species represented.3 Of the eleven genera of terrestrial mammals, about half are regarded as having been introduced by man, probably since the fourteenth century, either deliberately or by accident.4 These include the only carnivores, Viverra tangalunga and Paradoxunus hermaphroditus,5 thought by Wallace (I962 [I869]: 300) to have been domesticated by the Malays in order to procure civet and introduced accidentally into the island, and the only ruminant, the deer (Cervus timorensis). Deer are tamed and petted by the coastal Muslims and the flesh is considered a great delicacy, this apparently being the reason for the original introduction of this species. Wallace also maintains that the small shrew Suncus murinus, which is common throughout most of the island, was probably introduced by accident, being conveyed by inter-island sailing vessels. The same appears to be true for a number of other species of rat. Of the remaining mammals, the wild pig, though having possibly inhabited the island for a substantial period of time, is considered to have spread to the island after the termination of any pre- historic land bridge connexion with either New Guinea or the Celebes. The outstanding mammals, all indigenous species, are either peculiar to the Moluccas or representative of types only found elsewhere in New Guinea or northern Australia. One of these is the so-called Seram Island bandicoot (Rhynochomeles spp.), the rest are all species of cuscus or phalanger. Wallace-an early, but nevertheless authoritative source-describes the cuscus in his The Malay archipelago as follows: ... opossum-like animals, with a long prehensile tail, of which the terminal half is generally bare. They have small heads, large eyes and a dense covering of woolly fur, which is often pure white with irregular black spots or blotches, or sometimes ashy brown with or without white spots. They live in trees feeding upon the leaves, of which they devour large quantities. They move about slowly, and are difficult to kill, owing to the thickness of their fur, and their tenacity of life.... The natives everywhere eat their flesh, and as their motions are so slow, easily catch them by climbing; so that it is wonderful they have not been exterminated. It may be however, that their dense woolly fur protects them from birds of prey, and the islands they live in are too thinly inhabited for men to be able to exterminate them. (I962 [I869]: 301). Of the genus Phalanger, two common species are found in the central Moluccas and Seram: Phalanger orientalis orientalis and P. maculatus chrysorrhous (the spotted cuscus). A third species, P. celebensis, appears to be much less common and was not observed during fieldwork, nor do the Nuaulu appear to be familiar with it. The body length of the cuscus ranges between 325 and 650 mm, excluding its tail, which may add a further 240 to 6io mm. Fur is typically thick and woolly and coloration varies from wbite, reds and buffs, through various shades of brown to light greys and different intensities of black. Some members of the genus have suffusions of yellow or tawny colours over the shoulders, while others have dark</page><page sequence="3">MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 225 dorsal stripes which extend back to the rump. Their diet is composed largely of fruit and leaves but occasionally insects, birds and birds' eggs. They may live up to eleven years unless they fall a prey to their principal enemies-man and python (Walker I964: 64). All species are generally nocturnal or crepuscular in their habits. The paucity of terrestrial mammals on Seram means that they can all be reduced to a limited number of primary taxa in Nuaulu zoological taxonomy. These terms are given in table i, though it should be borne in mind that the phylogenetic vertebrate class which we label Mammalia and the Seramese representatives of which have been listed here in no way constitute a higher order taxon in Nuaulu classifi- cation in relation to any other differentiated group of land animals; it is used here purely as a descriptive construct. Neither is there a distinction drawn between mammals which we would distinguish as placentals or marsupials. The criteria generally considered so important are of little relevance in Nuaulu taxonomy.6 TABLE I.

Colour, size and markings seem-on the basis of statements by in- formants-to be the most important ethnotaxonomic criteria of distinction, giving four terminal categories based on the sexual dimorphism of two separate species. Thus each sex of each species is elevated to terminal taxon status. Of course, this does not mean that the Nuaulu are unaware that these are sexual differences, only</page><page sequence="5">MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 227 that they consider the differences significant enough for taxonomnic expression in this way. Table 3 expands the data to give the local Malay gloss (in which specific differences are distinguished) and the clans or subclans (ipan) for which the cuscus is ritually important or in some way sacred. It should be noted in this connexion that not all clans are further subdivided. TABLE 3.

This is a common feature of syntax in Nuaulu folk-classifications. Thus maranie becomes miiara'kokowe, tekene (gloss: snake) becomes teke'patona (Python reticulatus) and so on. In the now generally accepted sense of specific ritual relationships between natural categories and cultural groups (L6vi-Strauss I964: IS-I8) these relationships between clan and cuscus might be termed 'totemic'. Indeed, there are interesting similarities between the Nuaulu and the Tikopia material presented by Firth (I966: I2-I3) in the field of identification of natural species with social groups, in which both are characterised by 'considerable irregularities in the structural set-up' (I966: I2). The essence and nature of Nuaulu 'totemic' relationships as a whole pose the same kind of problems, but this is not the place to discuss these extensively. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that all ritual prohibitions and sacred objects, whether totemic or otherwise, are covered by the Nuaulu term mone which is best glossed as 'sacred',7 and that in all circumstances the eating of the flesh of mone animals is strictly forbidden, involving severe supernatural sanctions in cases of infringement. In such instances the effects of the sanction are seen as being partially alleviated by the payment of an appropriate ritual fine, but this is never regarded as total redemption. In one sense, as shown in table 3, the cuscus is clearly not behav- ing as a good totemic species, in that more than one clan has the same taxon as its principal emblem (mone mai'inai). However, it could be argued that these and other similar instances of duplication are anomalous transient products of clan fission (cf. Levi-Strauss I966:68). For example, Sonawe-ainakahata and Sonawe-aipura are both subclans historically derived from the single clan Sonawe. Again, Nepane- nesinopu and Nepane-tomoi'en are derived from the single clan Nepane. Now, the 'totem' of the latter subclan is the turtle (enu), which might well have held ascen- dancy over the cuscus in the hierarchy of mone items of the autochthonous clan Nepane, which would explain-if not resolve-the problem, see fig. i. Specula- tion of this kind, however, requires much further investigation within the context</page><page sequence="6">228 MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 of a general enquiry into the Nuaulu category mone. But irrespective of such intriguing conjecture the fact that mara'makinete is of primary religious importance for three ipan and not restricted to a singular 'totemic' association must be re- garded as a valuable statement of the significance of the cuscus in Nuaulu ritual as a whole. SONAWE NEPANE (miiara'makinete (enu) AINAKAHATA AIPURA NESINOPU TOMOI'EN (niara'rnakinete) (mara'makinete) (niara'rnakinete) (enui) FIGURE I. In terms of the scope of this article the most important fact to emerge from the tabulation of ethnotaxonomic data is the discovery that only a single terminal taxon of the general category marane carries any 'totemic' significance or implies taboo observances (mara'makinete, see table 3). Although this fact has already been partly established by the toxanomic data, final interpretation must await further ethnographic information. The cuscus in the Nuaulu hunting economy After the wild boar and deer, the cuscus, which is abundant and often hunted, provides the third most important source of animal protein in Nuaulu diet.8 The former animals, together with the cassowary, form a special ritual category of large game beasts or peni, which are subject to prescribed modes of distribution and involve an offering to the ancestral clan spirits each time such an animal is killed. The jawbones of deer and pig (pen'esite) and the breast bone of the casso- wary are preserved, involved in ritual and eventually strung in large numbers across the roof space of the house of each clan chief. The category penli appears to be distinguished, at least partly, from other animals, on account of the size of the species, representing as they do the three largest indigenous terrestrial animals on Seram-but they seem not to represent a genuine taxonomic category in Nuaulu classification, rather a category based on a more singular attribute.9 Such ritual attitudes are noticeably absent with regard to the cuscus, and peni meats are un- doubtedly preferred on the grounds of quantity and taste. With the cuscus it is the hunter who is actually responsible for securing the animal who has automatic claim to ownership, although he is obliged to share it with any fellow-hunter who may be present at the kill. In cases where identity of the actual killer is in some doubt the carcass will be shared out equally among all claimants. On return to the village, distribution of the meat among near kin follows the pattern adopted for other minor game animals, not in the peni category. Sometimes the mandibles are kept as trophies to secure fortune in future hunting and as signs of a particular individual's hunting prowess, but in no sense are they treated as pen' esite. No meat is allowed to be consumed uncooked and cuscus is usually eaten roasted, though occasionally it may be boiled in its own juice in lengths of cut green bamboo, al- though this is usually reserved for specified ritual occasions, as I discuss below. Hunting cuscus may be a specific undertaking or may be carried out casually from</page><page sequence="7">MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 229 the garden. It is usually done individually or in pairs, though occasionally others, often small boys of between about eight and thirteen years may be employed as beaters or to catch a cuscus which has fallen from a tree, using roughly fashioned wooden clubs. The cuscus is hunted either with a bow and arrow or by cornering the quarry so that it is unable to escape to a neighbouring tree: the tree which harbours it is then climbed forcing the animal to jump to the ground where it is caught by the hunter's comrades and helpers.Io It is of some relevance to point out at this juncture, with respect to the importance of the cuscus in Nuaulu thought, that the ghost of a man killed by falling from a tree in the course of a cuscus hunt is regarded as being of exceptional malevolence and is distinguished terminologi- cally from other ghosts-bearing the name kamanahune. Alternatively, a cuscus located near the ground, especially when resting in vines or tufts of epiphytic ferns can be captured with the use of improvised spears or sosote made from a thin bam- boo. Since the cuscus is nocturnal and in daylight hours rests frequently in the perches afforded by the peculiar birds-nest-fern (Asplenium nidus), nite une as the Nuaulu call it, it becomes an easy target. Such ferns are commonly to be found with many bamboo spears stuck into them somewhat after the fashion of a pin- cushion, the remains of a previous cuscus hunt. Occasionally snares (sinane) may be used which are arranged over the branches of suitable trees. Techniques used to attract the cuscus and coax it to a more exposed position include mimicking the calls of both the male and female, which are familiar to all Nuaulu hunters. In cases where a cuscus has been forced to drop to the undergrowth, it is chased and beaten into a semi-conscious state. It is, however, almost impossible to kill a cuscus directly in this manner and usually the fur has to be removed while it is still alive, exposing the handler to considerable danger, for a large cuscus has deadly teeth and claws and can inflict a serious wound. Wallace (I962 [I869]: 30I) has remarked on their incredible physical stamina as follows:- A heavy charge of shot will often lodge in the skin and do them no harm, and even breaking the spine or piercing the brain will not kill them for some hours. After it has been gutted the cuscus is either taken directly back to the village, or immediately roasted on a wooden skewer or asumate, which bears one or two notches for a female and none for a male. When the cooking is completed the asumate is stuck in the ground in the belief that the spirit of the dead cuscus will return in the body of another, thus increasing hunting fortune. In this sense, it may be seen as returning the cuscus spirit to its properly allotted place in the cosmos and therefore ensuring the continuity of the cycle. In addition, it was explained to me, it is a sign informing the ancestors to come and share their food. The asumate also bears witness to hunting skills and is thus a symbol of prestige. The cuscus in ritual As has already been pointed out, one of the most common ritual associations of the cuscus in Nuaulu thought is totemic, but apart from this it occupies an impor- tant role in relation to three major ritual crises; in the male initiation ceremonies, in connexion with birth rites and in the great ritual house or suane festival. It also occurs in association with some other minor ritual practices. What follows is a</page><page sequence="8">MAN, JUNE I972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 brief description of each of these three cardinal rituals, but only in so far as they are relevant to the present enquiry. i. On the night before the matahenie male initiations are to take place, a party of initiated nmales from the clan or clans concerned go out to hunt cuscus and capture the animals live. No particular variety is specified, although mara' makinete will be forbidden for some clans. The capttured animals are tied in the traditional way by binding the tail to a split stick and taken to a spot near the place where the ceremony is to be performed. Here they are hidden, tied to branches of small trees and ctustomlarily guarded by young boys, where they remain until they are required in the ritual. A hunting or collecting expedition of this kind, which is regarded as having ritual connotations and where the animals involved are believed to be sacred, is given a special name-matu'eu. The participants in the matu'eu and any other persons closely involved are for- bidden to tell the neophytes anything; the number and types of cuscus, where they are hidden or even that a itattu'eu has taken place. In particular, it is prohibited for anyone to mention that the animals are live-for, it is said, even if the neo- phytes do suspect something, they will expect them to be already dead. Of course, this is all pretence and the young men who are to be initiated know it full well. Nevertheless, it is a charade that has to be played out. During the journey to the sacred spot where the han'tetane or platform has previously been erected, those already initiated mock the neophytes, pointing to an imaginary cuscus in the surrounding trees and imitating its call. After the first part of the ceremony, which entails the investiture of the initiates with a rituLal barkcloth lap-lap and other regalia, they ascend the han'tetane as if to chew betel, an important aspect of all Nuaulu rites de passage. At this stage in the proceedings, much to the affected surprise of the novices, who are supposed to suspect nothing, the live animals are brought in by a party of young men and boys. The first cuscus (there being one for each neophyte) is brought and laid out to the motuntain side of the han'tetanie platform, where the first of the series of neophytes gives it a single crushing blow on the head with the back of a machete, sufiTcient to crack the skull or break the spine of the animal. As he does so he utters the cry ahu ... u .. . u!, which is followed by shouts of hi'oi, hi'oi, hi'oi, hi'oi, hi'oi! by the whole assembly in unison. This call and response is known as the huna hi'oi or unawahuta, and also occurs in the first part of the ceremony as the barkcloth is placed over the genitals of each novice. It is found again in connexion with the installation of office-holders. The ritual killing of the cuscus is termed kekui. Some- times, nowadays, the two most important points in the initiations (the placing on of the ritual backcloth and the killing of the cuscus) are accompanied by the setting-off of trade firecrackers or a volley of rifle fire. Noise is a customary accompaniment of these transitions, which even in the absence of these recent in- novations, are an occasion for shouting and banging (cf Needham i967:606-I4). The same procedure applies for each neoplhyte, after which the cuscus is taken aside, gutted and skewered on a pole to take back to the village. A village-wide feast or nasai follows at night, of which the most significant feature is the absence of what is the most important element of any other feast or meal, namely the staple sago porridge or sonar, damp sago flour transformed into a glutinous mass by the addition of hot water. Instead, a thin soup is extracted from the cooking of cuscus</page><page sequence="9">MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 231 (maranc sonaute), which is stewed in internodal lengths of green bamboo. This is simply drunk or used as a lubricant in the eating of the hard sago cakes (sekenai), another common item of Moluccan cuisine. 2. The cuscus is involved in Nuaulu birth ritual in the following way. As soon as possible after a woman has given birth (on the same or following day) the kapitane (war leader) or clan chief (y'onate ipan or ipane) having completed erecting the asinokoi, a kind of taboo sign put up near the menstruation hut in which the woman is confined, must go to the forest and hunt cuscus. Having done this he must return and cook the animal in bamboo and give it together with the blood to the mother in a freshly cut coconut shell. The cuscus must be skinned and the skin thrown away. I was told that it must not be cooked in the skin, for this is how cuscus is normally prepared and consumed. The mother is obliged to eat and drink it all in the belief that this will produce a plentiful and strong supply of milk (mara'susu nitone). 3. Finally, there is the great ritual house (suane) festival or hunuhatai otue. At a prescribed time after the completion of a new suane and after it has been used for a specified period of time for the kahuai dance, a great festival is held which is said to terminate all ritual involved in stuanie construction. This festival, which only occurs, at the very least, every ten to fifteen years, is the only time when the fireplace in the suane is used. On this occasion its function is in cooking ten of the animals in bamboo (as at the initiation ceremonies) which have previously been caught alive and ritually slain. The bones of consumed cuscus are then wrapped in wainite leaves and placed on a special shelf (sasara) over the north-east entrance (that is, towards the rising sun) for the ancestral spirits of the senior clan Matoke, who are the guardians of the suane. In addition, there are certain rituals in which the role of the cuscus is less crucial and more supplementary. Thus, along with sago flour, betel, betel-chewing re- quisites and damimar resin (Agathis alba), five carcasses (split sagittally and pre- roasted) are a required part of the kolna' npua payment which is the responsibility of the groom, his classificatory brothers and ZH or FZH at the time of marriage." I Again, at the first-fruits ceremony (se'ute), which must be performed for each garden before taro, yams, manioc and sweet potato can be taken, cuscus is the pre- ferred meat which is cooked together with the root tubers in bamboo and offered up to the ancestors and spirits of the garden. The instances cited above clearly indicate that the cuscus occupies a symbolic role because it is the cuscus and not just because it is a convenient animal in other respects; it is the sum of its attributes which make it an appropriate and meaningful symbol. In all three of the major examples given, it is slaughtered and consumed by the participants in the ritual. Further, as shown by the tabulated data, not only is it the only land mammal, or for that matter large terrestrial animal (apart, per- haps, from some pythons and monitor lizards), which is mnone, it also appears to be of some special ritual importance for eight out of the twelve Nuaulu clans or subclans, more than any other single creature. It is also suggestive in terms of the prevailing dualism in Nuaulu ritual and belief and typical of so much of eastern Indonesia, whereby at the exegetal, sociological and structural levels, binary oppositions between an unbelievable variety of phenomena-descent groups, sex,</page><page sequence="10">232 MAN, JUNE I972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 colours, cosmological referents, anatomical features, natural species, material artefacts, almost ad infinitum-so clearly manifest themselves. Alone among animals expressed in this way the cuscus does not have a complementary opposite. Instead it straddles a pair of binary oppositions of its own. Emara' makinete: mara'osu mara'kokowe: mara'sihaj MALE: FEMALE All this appears to be intimately related to its taxonomic and morphological status. We have seen that of all mammalian primary taxa recognised by the Nuaulu and shown in table i, the taxon marane is the only one which is further subdivided into terminal taxa; for the others the primary taxon is itself the terminal category. This is obviously not without some significance, as the Nuaulu pay meticulous attention to taxonomic differences between the four varieties of cuscus; they rarely use the general term marane, always taking great care to specify the particular variety concerned. Each variety has different and particular connotations, whether 'totemic' or otherwise. It is therefore not surprising that among marane it is mara'makinete which alone is of 'totemic' importance, for though the tenacity of life of the cuscus in general has already been amply demonstrated, it is the male of the species Phalanger maculatus which is noted for its enormous size and strength. So it is also not surprising that it alone is specified in spells and invocations, addressed frequently (as a term of respect) as kapitane mara'makinete. Thus, having disposed of the supplementary problem of 'why mara'makinete?' in terms of the most satisfactory interpretation of the available evidence, the much more impor- tant problem of 'why marane ?' can be turned to. Morphologically, as I have shown, the distinction between placental and marsupial is of absolutely no significance in Nuaulu ethnozoology, so that the distinctiveness of the cuscus cannot be attributed to its marsupiality. Moreover, other marsupials occur on Seram and are reasonably familiar to the Nuaulu: the taxa lau and kuha which appear to be two varieties of the Seram Island bandicoot (Rhynochomeles spp.). Where it does appear morphologically distin- guished from other animals is in its anthropomorphic features. In zoological terms the principal characteristics which the cuscus has in common with man can be listed as follows: i. large eyes directed forward; 2. globular cranium; 3. development of orbits, partly obscuring prognathic muzzle; 4. use of upright sitting posture; 5. resemblance of fore and hind paws to human hands, pentadactyly; 6. mode of eating with front paws; 7. strength and physical stamina (see section 2); and 8. white fur patches-said to resemble hair and beard of elders. I z These features are illustrated in plate I and in Le Souef and Burrell (I926). It is of some interest to point out the close evolutionary parallels with Primates in general (cf. Le Gros Clark I959), among which it was apparently originally placed. Certain other characteristics, such as the prehensile tail and dentition, are quite clearly</page><page sequence="11">MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 233 non-human, but on balance, and in contrast to all other animals known to the Nuaulu, it is remarkable for its humanoid appearance, which is a constant topic of conversa- tion among the Nuaulu tlhemselves. I3 The humanity of the cuscus becomes even inore apparent in the myth of origin of the subclan Nepane-nesinopu, for whom the male spotted cuscus (mara'makinete) is the primary totem. One is almost tempted to add that it is the physical attributes of mara'makinete, which have already been mentioned, which make it even more human than other varieties and therefore enhance its status as a totem, to the exclusion of all other types. One night an old man was walking when he heard the sound of the cuscus kahuai.I4 He made the ki-ki-ki-ki sound (which is used to attract the attention of a cuscus when hunting) and a large white kapitane cuscus descended from a banyan tree where the dance was being held. He struck the old man, who immediately fell down dead. Two days later the man's younger brother went to search for him and walked until he came to the place where his brother had died and saw his body. He sat down and waited until night came and saw the cuscus kahutai. He then went home where he constructed a bubu (fish trap) and took it to the place where his brother had been killed. He waited until night when the kapitane cuscus descended from the banyan tree again. The younger brother had hidden himself inside the bubu so that the cuscus could not see him. Attracted to the fish-trap the kapitane cuscus approached and entered it. As soon as he had done so the younger brother cut off his head in revenge of the death of his elder brother. He then went home and made an opore [a type of torch]. It was made from bamboo, with a handle and had a hole in the top of it. He also made a large bamboo cover for the opore. Then he returned to the banyan tree and waited till night returned and with it the cuscus kahuai. He climbed the tree with the opore, but each cuscus was unable to see the light owing to the bamboo cover. When he reached the top the brother saw countless numbers of the animal, suddenly withdrew the cover from the torch and waved it about him dazzling them all. Instantly they were turned into humans and returned with the brother to the village. And that is the origin of the clan Nepane-nesinopu; each one is a cuscus and lives at Hahuwalan.15 Now, it is true that at times in myths and stories other animals display certain human attributes; the snake, the monitor lizard, the tortoise and so on. After all, it is characteristic of myths to relate the activities of animals as if they thought and acted like men. But only with the cuscus among the Nuaulu is the identification so complete. And it is, as has been shown, only the cuscus which plays such a major part in ritual. It is a further characteristic of some myths that they provide inversions of the real world. In the Nepane-nesinopu cuscus myth the roles of hunter and hunted are reversed, which might reasonably suggest an interpretation demonstrating the dependence of man on the cuscus in the real world (and by the end of the myth the roles have reverted to their true relationship). However, it is in relation to headhunting (which probably ended finally in the central region of Seram during the first quarter of the present century) that the identification between marsupial and man in Nuaulu symbolism becomes estab- lished beyond all doubt. It is a well-documented fact for Seram as a whole, and the Nuaulu readily recall it with reference to themselves, that in former times it was a human and not a cuscus which had to be slain for the male initiations, that the hunahi'oi call and response was that given each time a victim was slain and a head taken, and that it was humans which were slain, their heads taken and put in the suane to complete the series of rituals involved in its construction. Indeed, the older men could recall having seen rows of skulls hanging in the suane of other villages</page><page sequence="12">234 MAN, JUNE I972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 to the north in their youth, and enthusiastically, though at times with affected shame, talked of the headlhunting exploits of their fathers and grandfathers. This practice is illustrated in a photograph of a ritual house at Nuniali, an Alune village on the nortlh-west coast, in Martin (I894: plate XVII). Reports that in parts of Seram these could still be seen were unfortunately unable to be confirmed during the course of fieldwork.I6 Despite the conspicuous replacement of cuscus for human in the initiation and suane ceremonies, the situation is not quite as clear-cut for the other cases where the cuscus is involved in ritual. In the case of marriage it is known that in former times it was a head which had to be presented to the clan of the bride as part of the bride- wealth, but the Nuaulu categorically assert that it is other objects, Chinese and continental porcelain, and red cloth, which have replaced the heads of slaughtered enemies. More iniportant, the use of the cuscus in the birth ritual does not appear to fit this explanation. One relevant fact may be simply the comparative abundance of the cuscus and-though vicious for its size-the relative ease and convenience with which it may be caught, which makes it an eminently suitable sacrificial animal, particularly when large numbers are required as in the matahene and suane festivals. Nevertheless, as a symbol, in this as in other circumstances, it quite clearly represents the Nuaulu. To a certain degree, of course, the cuscus can be regarded as being an ambiguous creature, if not anomalous. It is like man in a number of morphological and be- havioural respects, including-in addition-living above the ground (for Nuaulu houses are raised up on stilts) and yet it is unlike man in living in the forest and in the features it has in common with other wild beasts. In a number of important ways it imitates and resembles man and yet in other ways it is clearly not human. In structural terms it seems feasible that in this identification there is a mediation between the multiple antitheses culture: nature/domestic: wild/superior: inferior/ above: below and so on. However, this should not be confused with the kind of mediation suggested by the Stratherns (I968: I98), who maintain that birds and marsupials are good mediators on Mt Hagen in that though wild they may be assimilated into a domestic context by eating and ornamentation. This, they sug- gest, is the force behind their occurrence in spells. The inadequacy of this explana- tion is that any wild category utilised therefore becomes a mediator. To make a symbol meaningful (or a valid mediator, for that matter) it has to possess certain intrinsic emblematic qualities. This is what makes the cuscus a good symbol. This suggests two things: I) that recourse to recent Nuaulu culture history can satisfactorily confirm the meaning of certain current ritual usages; and 2) that quite apart from this the cuscus is identified with themselves in Nuaulu thought, for it is difficult to deny that it is the great morphological similarities between cuscus and man which provide its value in such a wide variety of rituals-as a powerful condenlsed symbol of humanity and themselves. As shown, in certain specific rituals the symbolic identification is ensured by the replacement of the human head by a cuscus, but as a general symbol, the evidence strongly suggests that it had historical priority, with respect to the cessation of headhunting and that its adoption in new circumstances (in those rituals which entailed the taking of human heads) was automatically assured on the basis of accepted symbolic proper- ties.</page><page sequence="13">MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. z Having established that the cuscus is a symbolic representation of Homo sapiens, certain other aspects of the accounts of ritual fall into place; the juices and meat as consumed in the birth ritual, though already apparent in terms of the exegesis given to the ethnographer, are concerned with fertility and strength (cuscus blood is identified with human milk). By analogy, the feast following the male initiations is also a celebration of fertility, as is the suane festival. The point I am trying to make here is not to show that they are concerned with fertility per se-almost all Nuaulu ritual is concerned with aspects of fertility (and this is made quite plain in the invo- cations and spells involved)-but to demonstrate the logic of the association cuscus! fertility; and I am not saying that this is all there is to it. The task I set myself was merely to demonstrate the symnbolic identity of man and cuscus in Nuaulu thought, not an exercise in reductionist anthropology. Certainly, in terms of the present analysis some aspects remain obscure, for example, the joking and pretence surrounding the cuscus in the matahene 'itualI7 and the full import of the cuscus in relation to the suane festival. But for these other explanations must be sought. Conclusiolns This article has attelmlpted to explore the ramifications of the cuscus as a symbol in Nuaulu thought, and to show that at the very centre of the problem is the syml.- bolic identity perceived between the cuscus and Nuaulu man in a series of contexts which include hunting, head-hunting, fertility, clan totemic associations and even in recalling sexual exploits.I8 Whereas Leach (I964) and Tambiah (I969) have demonstrated animal associations with man in an ecological or behavioural context, with the emphasis on such traits as attitudes towards domesticants, ritual pollution and verbal abuse, my stress has been on the importance of a demonstration of morphological association. It is interesting that both Tambiah (i969:44i) and Wijewardene (I968:8o, 8I, 87) have hinted at analogous metaphorical attitudes towards the monkey among the Thai, who-not unnaturally--see it as an imitation of themselves, but justify a prohibition on consumption of its flesh through a m-ythical inversion of Darwinism, maintaining that it is descended from man. Now, as has been shown, the opposite is the case for the Nuaulu, where humans-or at least some of them-are said in myths to derive from the cuscus, although retro- gression of certain species from ancestral humans is not unknown, as, for example, is found in the Matoke clan myth of origin of the monitor lizard, Varanus indicus (bwo). Another contrast between Thai and Nuaulu attitudes towards their respective anthropomorphic animals is the Thai prohibition of eating monkey and the Nuaulu regular consumption of cuscus and, indeed, its prescription in important ritual contexts (though restrictions on edibility are found for one specified variety). It is the human attributes (enforced by moral disapproval of the taking of human life) which makes the monkey an improper food for the Thai, expressed in their regard for it as a 'lost and degenerate human being'. In complete contrast, these same characteristics in the cuscus make it at once an approved and important symbol for the Nuaulu, with their head-hunting tradition. In short, while Thai attitudes to anthropomorphism in a particular animal are expressedly negative, Nuaulu attitudes are distinctly positive. Such contrary attitudes to the same phenomenon must surely justify a more intensive and comparative investigation of anthropollmorphic animal symbols. Nevertheless, before comparative documen-</page><page sequence="14">236 MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 tation and subsequent analysis can reveal worthwhile results, there is a need to define, in generally acceptable terms, what is meant by anthropomorphism, for if this article does little else, it does pose a problem to which, perhaps, anthro- pologists have tended either to pay only scant attention or to avoid on the grounds that it is self-evident. It could be argued that all identifications between man and beast are necessarily anthropomorphic, whether on the basis of anatomical, physio- logical or behavioural features, and without regard to whether these are exhibited to a greater or lesser degree. Thus, the familiar Nuer association of twins with birds is, in this sense, an anthropomorphic one. Associations with a wide variety of other animals occurring in symbolic contexts, as diverse as cassowaries and termites, in so far as they are in some way identified with man, can also be regarded as anthropomorphic in character. If this is the case then the difference of symbolic association between these animals and, what are patently the more ethnocentrically obvious animals, is largely one of quantification of individual features, together with their differential culturally-determined significance. Thus, while in many cases identification is at a single level, the Nuaulu identification is-as I have demonstrated-at a series of different levels. It would appear also that the emphasis attached to multiple-level identification tends to vary, on the one hand, with the positive anthropomorphic characters of the animals involved and, on the other, with often equally positive non-anthropomorphic and exotic features, which may vary widely, involving classificatory anomalies and relative economic significance, and so on. The combination of anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic qualities might be expected to be subject to considerable variation, suggesting that frequently the various qualities of individual symbols are derived from rather different spheres of interest. There can be no disagreement with Tambiah (I969:452) when he emphasises that in the long run it is insufficient to show correspondences and homologies between relational sets or resemblances between systems of differences, but accep- ting this should not involve carelessly overlooking the intensive investigation of particular instances of association. For it is on the foundation of particularistic analyses that the wider interpretations are either confirmed or rejected; and in this the considerable incongruities within the systems themselves can be ex- posed, which cannot always be so neatly explained in terms of currently fashion- able paradigms. In addition to this, I believe I have been able to demonstrate several other points of wider relevance. While, I hope, reinforcing the argument that it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of local classifications and ethnozoology in attempting to explain the role of animals as symbols, I have also tried to illustrate the importance of an enquiry into both the humanity and animality of the symbols involved: arguing that symbols have histories and that these are relevant to a full sociological explanation of their present usage, and that meaningful contributions can only be made by anchoring explanation firmly in ethnographic fact (cf. Bulmer I967:22). Finally, at a time when the study of symbolism is focused on the human body as a source of symbols, attention might usefully be drawn to instances where the body becomes the object of symbolism, not because of itself, but because of what it represents. For as Mary Douglas concludes (I970:70), echoing Mauss, 'the human body is always treated as an image of society and . . . there can be no</page><page sequence="15">MAN, JUNE I972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 237 natural way of considering the body that does not involve at the same time a social dimension'. In the cuscus the Nuaulu have a convenient and self-contained mirror not only of the human form, but also of their own values and culture. The cuscus has become a medium for expressing the sacred on behalf of the body. NOTES Fieldwork was carried out among the Nuaulu for eighteen months from I969 to 1971, under grants generously provided by the Social Science Research Council, the London-Cornell Project and the Central Research Fund of the University of London. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking Mr J. R. Edwards Hill of the British Museum (Natural History) for his assistance in the identification of preserved mammalian specimens collected in the field and for his advice, together with that of Dr R. D. Martin, on zoological and taxonomic matters in general. I should also like to express my thanks to James Woodburn, Maurice Bloch and Alfred Gell for their criticisms and suggestions. I The present literature on the Nuaulu-Huaulu peoples of central Seram is extremely limited and inadequate. Some notes on Makwana (Huaulu) in the Wahai district, together with a collection of materials obtained in the more easterly Manusela region is given in Roder (1948). 2 Though I have found it necessary to range widely over the various aspects of the cuscus in Nuaulu ethnography, my prime concern with certain specific problems of symbolism has meant that I have been forced to exclude other less relevant material pertaining to cuscus ethnozoology-e.g. technical procedures involved in its hunting and preparation and auguries. 3 In Nuaulu zoological classification, bats are considered distinctly aerial and not terrestrial forms, which identifies them together with birds in the higher order taxon manuwe. The data concerning species counts are extracted from Laurie and Hill (1954). 4 Both goats and, more recently, cattle have been introduced as domestic animals. From visits to nearby Muslim and Protestant communities, the Nuaulu are familiar with both these, for which they use the terms une-une and korobo respectively. Since they are regarded as quite definitely falling outside their own faunal environment and as they have little effect on Nuaulu culture they are not considered here. Dogs and cats are culturally relevant domesticants and are therefore included. 5 The generic and specific designations given by Wallace have been updated according to the nomenclature adopted by Laurie and Hill (I954). 6 Furthermore, we must distinguish between a specially named and conceptualised category (a true ethno-taxon), a covert unnamed category and a mere statement which explains a vague group of apparently related animals for the benefit of the ethnographer. On such problems, and associated ones, see Bulmer (I967: 9; I969: 4-7). 7 Mone more or less corresponds to the local Malay use of the term pemali, which Pino and Wittermans (I966: i6) translate as 'sacred, forbidden'. 8 In New Guinea cuscus and other marsupial fur is used widely for decorative purposes (see, for example, Williams 1930:4I). This is not so in Seram, probably because the inhabitants re- gard the skin as inferior to deerskin for such purposes as drumskins and axe-hafting, and because their techniques of preparing cuscus meat rarely involves skinning. Further, they possess no knowledge of tanning with either red ochre or lime which is commonly found throughout New Guinea. 9 This is representative of the kind of difficulties involved with the interpretation of conflicting taxonomies used for different purposes. But see also note 6 above and Bulmer (I967:9). 10 On occasions it is necessary for the hunter himself to bring the cuscus to earth with his bare hands. There are stories of hunters wrestling with a large cuscus (invariably mara'makinete) and being dragged and then falling from the tree entwined. The strength of the cuscus is also depicted in New Guinea oral traditions (Williams 1930:248). " A service performed by virtue of the fact that both the ZH and FZH (sau'uku) are in an inferior wife-taking relationship to the clan of the groom. 12 Cuscus with particularly fine growths of white fur are specifically compared with the ideally prominent beard of the kapitane. The resemblance of the whiteness of cuscus fur to the hair of old men also occurs in New Guinea (see Williams I930:269-70). 13 In parts of New Guinea the identity of man and cuscus is also openly acknowledged. Williams (I928) describes an Orokaiva myth which tells how the cuscus was once an old woman and explains that the digit which resembles a truncated human thumb was the result of the old woman cutting herself while pealing taro. '4 The kahuai dance is performed on specified ritual occasions in the suane (see above). Both men and young women participate.</page><page sequence="16">238 MAN, JUNE 1972, VOL. 7, NO. 2 '5 Free translation from the Nuaulu text. Inlformant: Komisi Somori, Ruhuwa 1970. I was unable to elicit any other Nuaulu myths or stories in which the cuscus plays a prominent part. Jensen and Niggemeyer (1939) give accounts of several from Seti in central Seram and from the Wemale area of west Seram (1939:305-6, 307) in which it adopts distinctly human charac- teristics, in addition to a number of Alune and Wemnale myths where this is less apparent (1939:123-4, 329). I6 It was emphasised by informants that when a person was slain it was only the head which was taken. There was no cannibalism, this being regarded as an uncivilised custom of the Poitai or people of New Guinea, who are also believed to be so uncouth as to eat meat uncooked. Thus, although the killing of the cuscus is in some cases a relic of the slaying of humans, the consumption of cuscus is not a hang-over fronm cannibalism. 17 Among the Alune, initiations take a different form and the cuscus is not ritually killed. However, the elders officiating pretend to confuse the initiates by jokingly pointing to imagin- ary cuscus, This kind of behaviour is reminiscent of that found in parts of the New Guinea highlands. In fact, the cuscus is frequently a source of fun and amusement among the Nuaulu. It is constantly imitated, which causes great hilarity, and to talk of hunting cuscus can be an extended metaphor in recalling sexual exploits. Mara'kokowe is forbidden to be mentioned in front of females as it is said to refer to the penis. In west and parts of south Seram (Sachse 1907: I64) children are said to imitate cuscus in dances, 18 See notes 2 and 17 above. REFERENCES Bulmer, Ralph I967. Why is the cassowary not a bird?
