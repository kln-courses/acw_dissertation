Princeton, N.J.: Prince- ton University Press, 1986. The Polish economic historian Witold Kula covers much ground in this study of the social significance of weights and mea- sures. The volume is divided into four parts. The first section accounts for half the book and presents a theoretical apparatus that is somewhat redundantly presented again in the two following sections, which chronicle the struggles for and against me- trological standardization in Poland and France. A final section explores the differ- ent receptions accorded to a supposedly "universal" metric system in Geneva, Pied- mont, Lombardy, Belgium, and regions where Napoleon raised the tricolor. Because systems of measurement ex- press the social content of the cultures that create them, they tend to gain a cultural impetus that resists change until the culture itself changes. Kula labels the earliest mea- sures as representational, by which he means determined by the needs of life and work. Anthropomorphic measures, such as the foot, were among the most common. The foot and other premetric measures contained some elements of agreed-upon convention but were not usually standard- ized. Thus contracts specifying the size of French fields often included a wooden copy of the foot used to calculate the contract. Other forms of representational measures expressed the conditions, objectives, and outcomes of human and animal labor. Taxes levied on traders in sixteenth-cen- tury Geneva were calculated by the sack, the amount of weight and volume carried by a double pair of pack asses. As the needs of consumption became more impor- tant, a third sort of representational mea- sure emerged, one based on labor, such as the loaves of bread used to pay agrarian la- borers. The right to determine measure was sym- bolic of sovereignty, and Kula reads the history of weights and measures as a his- tory of class struggles between peasant and landlord, landed nobility and urban bour- geoisie, regional notable and crown. This multilevel analysis and the comparative geographic focus are two of the book's merits.

Kula does not miss the social import of such folk tales. Peasants distrusted measuring with good reason, for their existence depended on the measures of grain, bread, and land. Their encounters with metrology and the market system were often unjtust, and measures provided the instrument by which millers cheated them of their grain and landlords reduced their holdings. Kula's discussion of grain measures reveals the reasons for the persistence of metrological heterodoxy in what is now Poland and France. Brought to light are several interesting customs of measurement; different measures for buy- ing and selling, for example. Less clear is his discussion of heaping, strickling, and striking, which could have benefited from diagrams of the tools and practices. Al- though landlords set the measures on their estates, those who held several estates saw no necessity to standardize practices across their holdings. Cheaper grains tended to be measured more generously, and measure- ment systems within each parish were usually clearly defined. In the millennium between Charlemagne and the Revolution, three fourths of the French used metrological standards set by feudal lords. By the eighteenth century me- trological chaos was rife. Even small areas such as the one now occupied by the de- partment of Gise had as many as 175 differ- ent land measures.

In Poland, where the idea of national unity was less ad- vanced and peasants had less contact with regional markets, the plea was for stan- dardization within the lord's estate. French scientists and scientific societies receive due consideration in Kula's ac- count of the metric system and its imple- mentation. Unfortunately, the translation contains only an abstract of a chapter that covered the role of Warsaw's Society of the Friends of Science in Polish metrologi- cal reform. The translation is clear, but the prose is not without choppiness. This vol- ume should interest specialists in historical metrology, revolutionary France, and Po- land. It is a noteworthy attempt to bring the history of metrology and economic history to a larger public. MICHAEL A. OSBORNE</page></plain_text>
