WILKERSON I. PUTNAM ON THE NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS At various times in the history of philosophy, and particularly in recent years, there have been attempts to defend a doctrine of natural kinds. The central thought is that objects are members of natural kinds in virtue of certain intrinsic properties, quite independently of other objects and, in particular, quite independently of ourselves and our systems of classification. Typical examples include kinds of chemical elements and compounds (carbon, oxygen, water, nitric acid) and kinds of biological individuals (chimpanzee, human, beech, oak). What makes carbon carbon, water water, a chimpanzee a chimpanzee, an oak an oak, is in each case a certain real essence, a property or set of properties necessary and sufficient for membership of the kind. We may not have the wit to discover all the natural kinds that exist but they are, as it were, out there, waiting to be discovered, and it is the job of scientists to discover them. Presented in that way, the doctrine of natural kinds is a metaphysical thesis, a view about what the world contains and how it works. It involves talking about natural kinds and real essences, and does not involve asking, for example, how names of natural kinds function in natural languages. Some philosophers will consider that omission a very serious one, and will argue that a sane account of natural kinds must rest'upon an understanding of the way in which we learn and use general names, and natural-kind names in particular. One very influential account of general names can be found in a number of papers</page><page sequence="2">2 T. E. WILKERSON by Putnam,1 and in this paper I want to consider whether the account applies to the names of biological kinds. So, although Putnam has a great deal to say about such names as 'gold' and 'water', I am only interested in what he has to say about such names as 'tiger' and 'lemon'. I shall discuss two alleged problems and, although I have broad sympathy with Putnam's view, I shall disagree over many important details. In the papers that form the focus of our discussion Putnam develops the general outlines of a view since dubbed 'externalism' - that is, the view that representations represent only if they have the right sort of causal connection with objects of the kind represented. 'Meanings ain't in the head.' In particular, he argues, words get their meaning, not because we are in certain special internal states when we use them, but rather because their use is causally connected in an appropriate way with the objects referred to. When I use a word like 'tiger', I may well have certain thoughts or ideas running through my head, but it really does not matter very much what they are. I may, for example, have thoughts of striped, feline, fierce Indian quadrupeds going through my mind - a set of properties that Locke would have called the 'nominal essence' of the animals in question - but such thoughts do not determine the meaning of the word 'tiger'. The crucial (though not perhaps the only) consideration is that my use of the word 'tiger' should have the right sort of causal connection with tigers. How then are general names, and particularly names of natural kinds, introduced? According to Putnam, we are blessed with a curious mixture of confidence and ignorance. We naturally find ourselves focusing on a group of objects that are superficially similar in colour, shape, habit, geographical position, etc., and we begin to think of certain objects as typical of the whole group. The general name is introduced originally as an indexical expression, that is, as an expression which allows us to point, literally or metaphorically, to objects in the group. So, for example, we focus on a group of animals that are large, striped, fierce felines from India, and we introduce the word 'tiger' to point to any one of those, in other words, to one of the typical tigers. Not only can we confidently apply the general name to any one of a number of objects, but with equal confidence we can list the properties of tigers: they are large, striped, fierce felines from India. But - and this is a crucial point - according to Putnam, these properties do not determine membership of the kind, and the list is not a list of ' See H. Putnam, 'Is Semantics Possible?', 'Explanation and Reference' and 'The Meaning of "Meaning" ', collected as Chapters 8, 11 and 12 of his Philosophical Papers, vol. II (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975).</page><page sequence="3">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 3 defining properties of tigers. They merely help us, in Kripke's words, to 'fix the reference' of the word 'tiger'.2 Indeed, such properties could not determine membership of the kind, because some members are abnormal and will lack one or more of them: there are albino tigers, toothless tigers, tigers that are mild and amiable, three-legged, or native to Regent's Park. At best, the properties define a tiger 'stereotype', and in practice our readiness to classify something as a tiger will depend on the extent to which it approximates to the stereotype. Confidence may now give way to ignorance. We confidently apply the word 'tiger', literally or metaphorically pointing to certain typical tigers, but may not have the faintest idea what actually determines membership of the kind. In introducing the name we suppose that there is some underlying property common to all the animals in question, and not merely to the stereotypical animals, a property that, in nature, determines membership of the kind. Moreover, in introducing the word 'tiger', we have committed ourselves to applying it to anything that has that underlying property, that has the relevant sameness relation to our original stereotypical tigers. But we may not know what the property is, and quite often will not know what it is. At this point, Putnam argues, most of us are compelled to exploit the 'division of linguistic labour'; that is, we wait upon the discoveries of experts, who will reveal the underlying property that supports our use of'tiger', and mutatis mutandis all the other underlying properties that support our use of other names for natural kinds. II. THE FIRST PROBLEM: ORDINARY LANGUAGE Two implicit assumptions now need to be brought to the surface. First, Putnam never says explicitly how we are supposed to connect his account with a formal taxonomy, but if we read between the lines, I think it is quite clear that he regards the names of biological kinds as names of species, and the underlying properties determining natural kinds as genetic properties that determine species. Second, I do not think it would be at all unfair to characterize Putnam's account as quasi-historical. Indeed, he introduces his remarks about the division of linguistic labour as a 'socio-linguistic hypothesis'.3 He is therefore committed to an empirical theory about the way in which general 2 S. Kripke, Naming and Necessity (London: Basil Blackwell, 1980), passim, esp. pp. 134-9. 3 See 'The Meaning of "Meaning" ', p. 227.</page><page sequence="4">4 T. E. WILKERSON words, and especially natural-kind names, are introduced and used in natural languages such as English. If Putnam is right, we should expect to find that English names of biological kinds normally refer to species, and that their use is supported by underlying genetic real essences which determine membership of species. We should also expect to find that we wait upon the experts to tell us what those genetic real essences are. At this point we encounter the first objection, namely that ordinary- language classifications (hereafter OLC) do not fit Putnam's model. That is, English names of biological kinds do not pick out species, their use is not supported by genetic real essences which determine the species, and we do not wait upon the discoveries of biological experts. John Dupre has produced a large number of interesting counter- examples,4 which I shall borrow with gratitude, mixing in a few of my own as we go. First, Putnam thinks of biological names as picking out species, but many OLC names pick out kinds of a higher level than the species. For example, 'oak', 'beech', 'elm', 'willow', 'rose', 'iris', 'chrysanthemum', 'rhododendron', 'narcissus' pick out genera; 'duck', 'wren', 'woodpecker' pick out families; 'gull' and 'tern' pick out sub- families; 'owl' and 'pigeon' pick out orders. Second, some OLC names fail to pick out any formal taxonomic kinds at all: for example, Dupre tells us, Americans easily distinguish between prickly pears and chollas, but the distinction corresponds to no taxonomic division. The same point applies to the very general OLC kinds tree, shrub, perennial, weed, vegetable and fruit. Third, some OLC names collect very different and unrelated species together, for example, 'wren', 'lily', 'daisy', 'orchid' and 'wolf'. Fourth, some OLC names have different uses in different dialects: according to Dupre, 'robin' collects one species in North America, another in Britain and a genus of flycatchers in Australia. What follows from all this? I think it clearly follows that Putnam's account of natural-kind names cannot be regarded as a quasi-historical account of the development of our ordinary-language classifications. But does anything else follow? For example, do Dupr's examples have any bearing on general attempts, such as my own, to defend an account of natural kinds? Dupre believes that they do. For his careful analysis of OLC names is a central part of his argument against the doctrine of natural kinds, and in favour of a view that he calls 'promiscuous realism'. Those who defend a doctrine of natural kinds claim that, although there are many similarities and differences between things, 4 SeeJ. Dupre, 'Natural Kinds and Biological Taxa', The Philosophical Review (1981), passim.</page><page sequence="5">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 5 one set of similarities is privileged, because they are the real essences which determine natural kinds. In contrast, the promiscuous realist argues that none of the similarities is privileged, and each is important only relative to a particular concern. As far as biological individuals are concerned, a formal taxonomic classification will be of interest to biologists, horticultural and agricultural classifications will be of interest to gardeners and farmers, gastronomic classifications to cooks and gourmets, taxidermal classifications to taxidermists, floral classific- ations to florists, and everyday classifications will serve many of us very well for ordinary non-specialist purposes. This view is a version of realism, because the similarities and differences that underpin each system of classification are independent of our beliefs and theories, but the realism is promiscuous, because there will be an indefinitely large number of possible systems of classification, each one reflecting a different interest and concern. Moreover, the various classifications may overlap and run across each other: we would, for example, expect to find a considerable overlap between formal taxonomic classifications and the classifications of gardeners, farmers and zoo keepers. (Dupre might have mentioned a short story by R. K. Narayan, in which his gardener has only two kind names. One is an example of a name that elsewhere5 I have called a hybrid name, and the other is a very high level natural-kind name: 'This, Sir, is a weed.' 'And that?' 'That, Sir, is a flowering plant.') I shall return to promiscuous realism later on, and for the moment I want to argue that Dupre's examples, though important and interesting, do not seriously undermine Putnam's account, and are not counter-examples to a doctrine of natural kinds. Let us return to Putnam. He claims that I introduce a natural-kind name by pointing, literally or metaphorically, to apparently typical examples of the kind, examples which share various properties that are associated with, but do not strictly define, the kind name. And I suppose that the kind is determined by some property common both to the original stereo- typical individuals and to other members of the kind, though I may not know what it is, and will usually need to call on experts to tell me. Now there is one important omission in this account, though Putnam can remedy it without serious inconsistency. The omission consists in a failure to notice that many of our attempts to invent new natural-kind names misfire, because our assumption that there is some underlying property common to all the members of the supposed kind may be false. Our language has a long memory, and is littered with the debris of 5 See T. E. Wilkerson, 'Natural Kinds', Philosophy (1988), p. 42.</page><page sequence="6">6 T. E. WILKERSON numerous botched shots at natural-kind classification. For example, we collect various stereotypical animals together, and use their superficial features to fix the reference of 'wolf' or 'wren' or 'lily' or 'orchid', not realizing that we are collecting different species together. Or our popular names for species suggest a close relationship where none in fact exists ('ash' and 'mountain ash'; 'fox' and 'flying fox'). Or, in an attempt to collect species, we collect genera (oak, beech, elm, willow) or kinds that correspond to no taxonomic categories (prickly pear, cholla). At the limit, we even introduce natural-kind names that turn out to refer to nothing at all, such as 'animalcule', 'ether' or 'the Missing Link'.6 Such failures are not surprising. Until fairly recently, we have had neither the scientific expertise nor the necessary technology to discover the real essences that determine physical, chemical and biological natural kinds. We have had to lean heavily, even exclusively, on superficial features, on Lockean nominal essences, for they were the only features accessible to our experimental instruments, our five senses, For example, in attempting to classify plants and animals we have had to concentrate solely on gross morphological and physio- logical features, and have inevitably been misled by them. I suppose someone might try to argue that the survival of antiquated systems of classification is highly significant, and might wonder why we pay so little attention to the received wisdom of the experts. But again I cannot see that such survival is either surprising or significant. As Scott Altran has pointed out, even when a name has originally been introduced as a supposed natural-kind name (or, as he puts it, an 'underlying trait term'), whose use is underpinned by some underlying but unknown property, it may survive the discovery that our supposition is incorrect. We may have such a strong interest in the objects in question that we are not in the least concerned to modify our classification with the help of experts: the 'phenomenological concept' may persist as an underlying trait term regardless of science's opinion on the matter. 'Hawk' and 'sparrow' persist as underlying trait terms because their usual denotations are readily perceived to be components of local 6 If I read him correctly, Kripke denies that there can be the limiting case, where the supposed natural-kind name turns out to refer to nothing at all. See his Naming and Necessity, p. I35n. Talking of gold, he says: 'We know in advance, a priori, that it is not the case that the items are typically fool's gold.' But that seems an odd view. In a sense we have discovered that all our samples are samples offool's phlogiston, or fool's ether! So we could not have known a priori that they are not.</page><page sequence="7">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 7 nature; the Tzeltal Maya, for instance, recognise similar taxa.7 Furthermore, even when we have the scientific expertise and the necessary technology, we cannot guarantee that we shall produce the right answers, or routinely uncover the real essences of things. So my response to Dupre's examples is to say that many of them simply commemorate unsuccessful attempts at a natural-kind classific- ation. The point, no doubt, tends to get lost in Putnam's zealous flight from intension, but I think that he can concede it, by slightly changing the emphasis here and there. Instead of saying that I introduce a name by pointing to a group of objects, which share some underlying property that determines membership of the kind, he should say that I may try to introduce the name, and that I suppose (sometimes wrongly) that the objects share some underlying property. I conclude that Dupre's examples do not undermine Putnam's account of biological names. III. THE SECOND PROBLEM: SPECIES, ESSENCES AND NATURAL KINDS We now turn to a second problem, which concerns Putnam's assumption that species are good examples of natural kinds, and his apparent confidence that membership of species is determined by underlying genetic properties. It might seem obvious that humans are humans, chimpanzees chimpanzees, weeping willows weeping willows, etc., in virtue of their distinctive and peculiar genetic constitution. But this suggestion is open to a very serious objection, namely that species are not uniquely determined by genetic constitution. There is typically enormous genetic variation between members of the same biological kind, and there is often considerable genetic similarity between closely related species. That is, genetic real essences of natural kinds do not exist. Consider examples. Any gardener will be aware of the enormous variation between different varieties of the same species. No doubt the variations can be explained by reference to genetic features, but there may be no genetic features that unite all the members of the species, all the individual examples of the many varieties. There may not even be a genetic feature to unite all parts of the same individual, for, particularly in plants, different parts of the same individual may be genetically 7 Scott Altran, 'Ordinary Constraints on the Semantics of Living Kinds', Mind and Language (1987), pp. 51-2.</page><page sequence="8">8 T. E. WILKERSON different. Gardeners who notice genetic variation in a new stem call it a 'sport', cut it off and propagate it, in the hope that it will prove to be commercially successful. Someone might suggest that the genetic feature we are looking for is a structural feature of the genetic material - for example, the number of chromosomes peculiar to each species. Despite the wide genetic variation between individual humans, we might say, they all have twenty-three pairs of chromosomes. Sadly, they do not! Down's syndrome, for example, is due to an extra chromosome, and, as athletics administrators, interested in genetic sex testing, have discovered with dismay, some humans carry an extra sex chromosome. In plants polyploidy is very common. In other words, because of an irregular division of genetic material in ancestors, many plants have three or more sets of chromosomes, rather than the normal two. In some cases different varieties of the same species will have different numbers of chromosomes: in apples, for example, a few varieties are haploid, with seventeen chromosomes, many are diploid, with thirty-four, some (such. as Bramley's Seedling) are triploid, with fifty-one, some tetraploid, with sixty-eight, and so on. So the more we attempt to isolate the genetic features that determine biological species, the more hopeless the task becomes. And perhaps we have unconsciously been driven by a misleading picture of natural kinds as marked by nature, rather in the way in which the boundaries between pigeonholes are clearly marked. Darwin, it might be said, demolished that picture for ever. It is not just that the work of evolutionary biologists has revealed many more boundaries than had ever been imagined - many more species, many more intermediate and hybrid species - but the conception of boundaries is a thoroughly misguided one. If we are properly to understand evolution and genetic variation, and if we must have some picture to help us, then the picture must somehow reflect the fluidity of species, the way in which they may merge, almost imperceptibly, into one another. Boundaries are no doubt helpful for field biologists, gardeners and zoo keepers, but they do not exist in nature. John Dupre makes this suggestion: The existence of species . . . may be seen as consisting in the following fact. If it were possible to map individual organisms on a multi-dimensional quality space we would find numerous clusters or bumps. In some parts of biology these clusters will be almost entirely discrete. In other areas there will be a continuum of individuals between the peaks. It can then be seen as the business of biology to identify these peaks.8 8 Dupr6, 'Natural Kinds and Biological Taxa', p. 82; also compare his 'Wilkerson on</page><page sequence="9">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 9 The biologist Stephen Jay Gould also favours the picture of continua: Islands of form exist, to be sure: cats do not flow together in a sea of continuity, but rather come to us as lions, tigers, lynxes, tabbies, and so forth. Still, although species may be discrete, they have no immutable essence. Variation is the raw material of evolutionary change. It represents the fundamental reality of nature, not an accident about a created norm. . . . Anti- essentialist thinking forces us to view the world differently. We must accept shadings and continua as fundamental.9 Gould's readers will notice that he wishes to draw certain liberal moral and political conclusions but, although those conclusions are appeal- ing, they are irrelevant for my purposes here. I merely wish to explore his, and Dupre's, suggestion that species should be thought of as forming continua, rather than as separated like pigeonholes. Incidentally, we should note in passing that the claim that there are no genetic real essences, and the claim that species should be thought of as forming continua, are distinct claims. The second claim probably implies the first. That is, if species are arranged in a continuum, it is difficult to argue that each species is determined by a peculiar real essence. But the first claim certainly does not imply the second. That is, if there are no genetic real essences, it does not follow that there are no discrete species. Even if each species were discrete, and qualitatively quite distinct from every other, it would not follow that it was determined by a single property or set of properties necessary and sufficient for membership of that species. Members of different species may turn out to be genetically very similar; members of the same species may turn out to be genetically very different. Again compare Dupre: the existence of discrete species is one of the most striking and least disputable of biological data. If one examines the trees or birds in a particular area, it is apparent that these fall into a number of classes that differ from one another in numerous respects. But the essentialist conclusion that one might be tempted to draw from this fact is dissipated first by more careful study, which reveals that these distinguishing characteristics are by no means constant within the classes, and second by Natural Kinds', Philosophy (1989), passim. 9 Stephen Jay Gould, The Flamingo's Smile (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1987), pp. 160-1.</page><page sequence="10">10 T. E. WILKERSON extending the scope of the investigation in both space and time, whereupon the limitations both of intraspecific similarity and interspecific difference will become increasingly apparent.10 IV. A BAD REPLY: PROMISCUOUS REALISM So that is our second problem: if natural kinds are determined by real essences, and if species are good examples of natural kinds, then we appear to have produced a contradiction, since species are not determined by real essences. And realists of a nervous and pessimistic disposition might fear that realism will have to be given up altogether, and that we shall have to endure some kind of anti-realism, some version of the view that the features we attribute to the world are strictly features of ourselves and our systems of belief, rather than features of the world as it is in itself. But that pessimism is too hasty. Even if we were eventually forced to abandon essentialism (and I hope to salvage it later on), there would be at least one other version of realism available, namely Dupre's 'promiscuous realism', which I touched on earlier. In the course of criticizing Putnam, Dupre is struck by the range of purposes served by our ordinary-language classifications. Some names are borrowed from biologists or are relics of discarded biological classifications; some reflect the interests of farmers; others those of cooks and gourmets, or timber merchants, or flower arrangers, or gardeners, or furriers, or hunters, or zoo keepers, and so on. Each classification is admirable for its purposes, and typically reflects them. One classific- ation may be entirely useless for other purposes: cooks and gardeners insist on a strong distinction between onions, garlic and ornamental Allium species, but biologists do not; zoo keepers' questions about the habits of animals cut right across taxidermists' questions about their suitability for stuffing and embalming; and so on. Each classification focuses on certain similarities and differences, but no similarities or differences are privileged or significant in themselves. A range of similarities and differences is significant only relative to a special interest, for example, the interests of farmers, or gardeners, or cooks, etc. So, in contrast to the essentialist such as Putnam, who argues that similarities and differences of interest to biologists are privileged, and somehow mark the real joints of nature, Dupre offers us 'promiscuous realism': The realism derives from the fact that there are many sameness relations that serve to distinguish classes of organisms in ways '1 Dupre, 'Natural Kinds and Biological Taxa', p. 89.</page><page sequence="11">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 11 that are relevant to various concerns; the promiscuity derives from the fact that none of these relations is privileged." At the risk of being tediously repetitive, I should stress that promiscuous realism is a version of realism. I say that, because so often in philosophical discussion the claim that some concept reflects our interests quickly degenerates into the claim that it merely reflects our interests, and anti-realism is never far behind. But that is not Dupre's view. He wants to say that the features fastened on to by, for example, farmers or gardeners are real features of the world. It is just a fact about the world, not a fact about us, that some animals produce milk, that some plants survive the British winter, that some plants are edible, and so on. The only relevant fact about us is that if we are farmers, we will concentrate on one set of real features; if we are gardeners, we will concentrate on a rather different set; if we are zoo keepers, we will concentrate on another set; and so on. It is pleasing to be offered different versions of realism, but I want to reject promiscuous realism, for two main reasons. Both reasons turn on the general thought that the promiscuous realist leaves too much unexplained. I concede straight away that there are many different, but often overlapping, ordinary-language classifications, and that typically each classification reflects the peculiar interests of, say, farmers or gardeners or cooks or gourmets or flower arrangers or taxidermists or zoo keepers, or, of course, of professional biologists. But my first worry concerns the reference to the interests and purposes of each group. The word 'interest' is ambiguous, and I suggest that Dupre's argument trades on the ambiguity. Sometimes when we say that someone has an interest in something, we mean merely that they think a lot about it, devote their leisure hours to it, easily focus their attention on it, and so on. The football fan is interested in football, the philatelist in stamps and the botanist in botany. Sometimes, however, when we say that someone has an interest in something, we mean that they have some practical benefit in view. Despite the sad decline of the English word 'disinterested', some of us still manage to mark the distinction by distinguishing two different failures of interest: someone may be uninterested, or disinterested. If the legal dispute is nothing to do with me, but is full of juicy and scandalous detail, I will be interested but disinterested. If my name is Jarndyce, and I am heartily sick of the whole thing, I may be uninterested but have an interest. " Ibid., p. 82.</page><page sequence="12">12 T. E. WILKERSON There are related ambiguities in such words as 'anthropocentric' and 'anthropomorphic', which also occur in Dupre's comparison of ordinary-language classifications and scientific taxonomy (TC): The functions of OLC, unsurprisingly enough, are over- whelmingly anthropocentric. A group of organisms may be distinguished in ordinary language . . . because it is economically or sociologically important . . . because its members are intellectually intriguing... furry and empathetic ... or just very noticeable. TC, hopefully, avoids this anthropocentric viewpoint. The number of species names is here intended to reflect the number of species that exist. Nonetheless, even here there is an anthropomorphic aspect. For an adequate taxonomy ... must also be practically usable.'2 But several different senses are being muddled together here. When I say that a classification is anthropocentric, I might mean that it is logically anthropocentric, that any analysis of the classification would involve essential reference to an actual or possible person. For example, our names for artefacts are typically logically anthropocentric: a table is something with a flat surface capable of supporting the portable goods of a normal human being; a house provides shelter for human beings; and so on. Narayan's gardener uses a classification that is, in part, logically anthropocentric, for a weed is a plant that human gardeners typically do not want in the garden. But sometimes when I say that a classification is anthropocentric, I mean that there is a direct causal connection between the classification and some practical human interest or concern. Taxidermists classify skins and carcasses in a particular way because they want to find skins that survive pre- servation and stuffing; cooks are looking for things good to eat; zoo keepers want to entertain visitors and preserve threatened species; timber merchants hope to sell wood at a profit; and so on. And finally, sometimes when I say that a classification is anthropocentric, I may mean very little. I may be trying vainly to make something of the obvious and dreary fact that classifications are invented and used by classifiers. I can now make my first point against promiscuous realism. I suggest that there is an important difference between many ordinary-language classifications and scientific taxonomies - between OLC and TC. 12 Ibid., pp. 80 and 81.</page><page sequence="13">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 13 Much of our work with OLC is overwhelmingly connected with some purely practical interest. (I say 'much' rather than 'all' because, as I explained earlier, some OLC names are the debris from one or other failed attempt at TC.) It arises from, and is stimulated by, a wish to make money, or eat agreeable food, or satisfy a desire to grow the pretty and the profitable, and would make little sense in the absence of such practical interest. Moreover, many OLC names are anthropocentric in the two most interesting senses I distinguished. That is, they are logically anthropocentric, and implicitly make essential reference to human desires ('weed', 'houseplant', 'cattle', 'pet'); or they are causally anthropocentric, and their use causally depends on someone's desires and practical interests ('shrub', 'ground cover', 'guard dog', 'poultry'); or, of course, both. In contrast, TC names have no necessary connection with our practical interests. No doubt serious taxonomy would grind to a halt if there were no one with a consuming professional or amateur passion for such things, but the classification would still have some point, for it would, at least in intention, record the important distinctions in nature. Furthermore, TC is neither logically nor causally anthropocentric. It neither refers implicitly but essentially to the desires and practical interests of human beings, nor causally depends on those practical interests. Indeed, it is very difficult to say what the 'practical interests' of biologists might be. Every answer seems fatuously circular ('their practical interest is in biological classific- ation'), trivial ('they are interested in producing a classification that is usable'), or cynical to the point of obstinate irrelevance ('they want to gain prizes and honours, astonish the crowd and humiliate their colleagues'). My second point against promiscuous realism is a point about causation and explanation. One central scientific concern is to explain the world around us and to predict how it will behave. But that requires an interest in the causal powers of things. At the risk of hyperbole, we might say that the scientist is concerned to expose the causal structure of reality. Now, as I have argued elsewhere,13 many of the kinds we distinguish do not lend themselves to serious scientific investigation, because they are not systematically connected with the causal powers of things. There can be no science of tables and chairs, as such, or even of trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals, as such, because the classific- ations in question do not implicitly classify causal powers. Of course, tables, chairs, trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals obey causal laws, but only relative to another, quite different system of classification, namely classification of natural kinds. So the causal powers of my table 13 See Wilkerson, 'Natural Kinds', esp. pp. 29-34.</page><page sequence="14">14 T. E. WILKERSON are determined by its being made of cellulose, not by its being a table; those of my tree by its being an Acer, not by its being a tree; those of the perennial by its being a hosta, not by its being a perennial; and so on. So my second point against promiscuous realism is that it overlooks an important difference between OLCs and TC (or a formal taxonomy): typically, only TC is intended as a classification that implicitly reveals the causal powers of things. And that is why natural kinds, unlike many of the kinds we find in OLC, lend themselves to serious scientific investigation. Once again I make the obvious concession: cooks, gourmets, taxidermists, farmers, gardeners and other users of OLC have a profound interest in cause and effect. If not, they could not guarantee that the meat was cooked, the skin preserved, the cattle fed and the seeds germinated. But my claim is that such guarantees are possible only if tacitly we move from the rather superficial concerns of OLC and lean heavily on the causal stories systematically interwoven with TC. V. A BETTER REPLY I therefore reject promiscuous realism, and continue to argue that, among the various overlapping systems of classification available to us, one (namely TC) is privileged, and the similarities and differences it records are privileged. But we are now faced once again with our original problem. Biological species are apparently good examples of natural kinds, and each natural kind is supposedly determined by an intrinsic property or set of properties necessary and sufficient for membership of the kind. But there are typically no intrinsic properties or sets of properties necessary and sufficient for membership of species. The only candidate that looks remotely plausible, genetic structure, fails to do the trick, because in the real world there is considerable interspecific genetic similarity and intraspecific genetic variation. We should, in the words of Gould and Dupre, think of species as forming continua, albeit with occasional bumps and clusters, rather than as forming quite separate, discrete islands of form. In this section I shall offer my own solution of this problem, by exploiting a number of important points that have emerged from the discussion so far. One general point is that an account of natural kinds arises from an interest in causal explanation and prediction, and that interest cannot be served by a promiscuous realism which gives equal weight to any useful system of classification. A second point is that, although typically it is impossible to find genetic features that uniquely determine each species, there can be no doubt that an interest in causal</page><page sequence="15">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 15 explanation inevitably produces an interest in genetic explanations. There is a striking asymmetry between the gross macroscopic features of plants and animals and their microscopic - and especially their genetic - features. The macroscopic do not causally determine the microscopic, but the microscopic do causally determine the macro- scopic. Anyone seriously interested in explaining and predicting the behaviour of plants and animals would be foolish to concentrate on, for example, morphological features, on the structure of leaf and root, of fur and tooth. The fundamental engines of structure and change are genetic. A third point can now be brought into the open. Causal explanations are implicitly or explicitly general. I may be trying to explain a particular event or state of affairs, but I am committed to offering the same explanation of all relevantly similar events or states of affairs. One common way of making the point is to appeal to the notion of a subjunctive conditional (though I am not clear what one says in languages that have no subjunctive!). I may say, for example, that the chlorotic yellowing of the leaves in this plant was caused by the relative alkalinity of this soil, but I imply that any other plant of a relevantly similar kind would suffer from chlorosis if it were growing in a relevantly similar alkaline soil. Even when the event to be explained is historically unique, the explanation is implicitly general, and implies an appropriate subjunctive conditional. So to our problem. How can I continue to defend a doctrine of natural kinds, while conceding that species are not determined by genetic real essences? The simple (some might say, the wildly heroic) answer is that we should abandon the assumption that species are good examples of natural kinds. There are natural kinds, kinds determined by properties necessary and sufficient for membership in each case, but the kinds are typically not species. Indeed, in many cases the kind will be very much narrower than the species, and may have only one member. My line of thought is as follows. Let us return for a moment to Gould's remarks about continua: We must accept shadings and continua as fundamental.... The taxonomic essentialist scoops up a handful of fossil snails in a single species, tries to abstract an essence, and rates his snails by their match to this average. The anti-essentialist sees something entirely different in his hand - a range of irreducible variation defining the species, some variants more frequent than others, but all perfectly good snails.'4 14 Gould, The Flamingo's Smile, p. 161.</page><page sequence="16">16 T. E. WILKERSON Now, of what are the continua continua? Fairly obviously, we have a continuum of individuals, where two adjacent individuals would share many similarities but would be distinguished by at least one significant difference. But clearly, we also have a continuum of kinds. Even in a species characterized by considerable genetic variation, where some individuals are genetically unique in all interesting respects, there will be a continuum of kinds. For explanation of the features of each unique individual requires generalization, and that requires the dependence of certain features of a kind on certain other features of a kind. The real essence which is in part causally responsible for the behaviour of the genetically unique individual is the essence of the kind of which the unique individual is the only member. To sum up, then, my view is this. There are natural kinds. Each natural kind is determined by a real essence, a property or set of properties necessary and sufficient for membership of the kind in question. The real essence in turn grounds the causal powers of individual members of the kind. Biological natural kinds are determ- ined by genetic real essences which are causally responsible for the behaviour of individual members of the kind. But, since there is considerable interspecific genetic similarity and intraspecific genetic variation, there are far more biological natural kinds than species. I should add three further comments - though I suspect that some readers will regard the comments as objections to my view. The first comment is this. I have stressed the role of genetic structure in causal explanations and have argued that, even when explaining the behaviour of an individual, I am implicitly explaining the behaviour of individuals of a kind. I have also stressed the range of interspecific genetic similarity and intraspecific genetic variation. But presumably any genetic feature may have a causal role and any genetic difference between two individuals may determine a difference in their behaviour. Since I want to say that natural kinds are determined by causal powers, I am forced to leave open the very definite possibility that there will be as many kinds as individuals. Is that not absurd? I think not. I would not be particularly worried if we finished up with as many individuals as natural kinds, but, for two reasons, I think that it is very unlikely that we shall. One reason is that many genetic features are causally inert. Only a small fraction of the information carried in strings of DNA has any role in affecting the overall structure and behaviour of the individual concerned. The second reason is that there is a great deal of fog surrounding the expression 'genetic feature'. If I may help myself to the distinction between function and realization, which is normally prominent in a very different context, the point can be put like this.</page><page sequence="17">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 17 When I say that genetic features affect the structure and behaviour of the individual concerned, are the genetic features to be characterized in terms of their realization (e.g., as complex molecules consisting of atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, etc.), or in terms of their functional role (e.g., in terms of their anatomical and physiological effects)? Certainly, if we characterize them in terms of their realization, we may well be committed to as many kinds as individuals. But, if we characterize genetic features in terms of their functional role, we can take advantage of the fact that there will be a wide range of different realizations of the same genetic feature, and in turn will be able to regard two individuals different at the level of realization as belonging to the same natural kind. Now there is a compelling reason for characterizing genetic features in terms of their functional role. The crucial consideration is that the concept of a gene is itselfa functional concept: that is, a gene is precisely a structure that directly affects the anatomical and physiological features of the whole organism. Moreover, the causal powers of a gene are the causal powers of the whole gene, not the causal powers of its microscopic realization. As with any other object or structure in which we can distinguish function from realization, it does not matter what it is made of, or how it is constructed, as long as the causal powers of the whole object or structure remain the same. The pencils on my desk, or the washing machines in the shop, will be different at the level of realization, but at the functional level - qua pencils or washing machines - will have the same causal powers. Similarly, there may be many different realizations of the same gene, many different arrange- ments of atoms which at the level of the whole gene have exactly similar causal powers. So if natural biological kinds are determined by genetic structure, and if genetic structure is to be characterized functionally, that is, in terms of the causal powers of the whole gene, we should not expect there to be as many kinds as individuals. The second comment takes me back to Putnam. Even if my first comment turns out to be true, I am still committed to far more natural kinds than species, for, typically, any species contains individuals genetically different from one another in ways that significantly affect their structure and behaviour. But such differences are not reflected in our names for natural kinds. Indeed, compared with the number of natural kinds, as I conceive of them, we have only a handful of names. Nor is it worth our while to invent names for every natural kind even if we are committed to developing an accurate taxonomy. As long as biologists have the language of molecular biology, they can charac- terize the many variations in genetic structure that underlie kinds of</page><page sequence="18">18 T. E. WILKERSON biological individual, and will not need names for all the kinds. But that seriously undermines Putnam's account of general names. Since, on my account, both professional biologists and ordinary folk will draw the boundaries of nature with a very broad brush, it is not true that our use of general names is consistently underpinned by certain underlying properties of the things in question, and afortiori it is not true that the extension of the names is determined by those underlying properties. Nor, of course, is it true that the extension of a general word is determined by the real features of objects, rather than by human decision. For, in introducing and using general names, we must decide how closely we wish our names to reflect the full range of natural kinds, and how far we are prepared to extend our use of existing names to individuals that share some genetic features of our original stereo- typical individuals, but not others. My third comment is an attempt to confront a difficulty about the status of formal taxonomy. I began by entertaining the thought that every species is a natural kind, determined by a real essence, that is, by a property or set of properties necessary and sufficient for membership of the kind. I went on to reject it, on the ground that species were not determined by real essences, and finished by arguing that on my conception of natural kinds there may be far more natural kinds than species. However, I consistently rejected any anti-realist or instru- mentalist account of formal taxonomy: according to me, a formal taxonomy is supposed to tell us what kinds of thing really exist in nature. But I also resisted Dupre's 'promiscuous realism', and insisted that, although many systems of classification are available to us, a formal taxonomy has a special or privileged status. Two connected questions immediately arise. First, am I guilty of inconsistency? If I deny that species are typically natural kinds, am I not thereby committed either to anti-realism or instrumentalism or to promiscuous realism? Second, what do I take taxonomists to be doing? If they are not marking out natural kinds, what are they doing? The answers to those questions emerge as soon as we pick out one important thread in my account of natural kinds. At the centre of my account is the notion of an intrinsic property, a property that does not consist in, or depend on, a relation to something else. For example, as I have argued in this paper, biological kinds are determined by intrinsic properties, for they are determined by genetic properties. And the genetic features of an organism logically do not consist in, or depend on, a relation to something else. In contrast, the biologist's conception of a species is rather more complex. As I argued earlier, the interest in intrinsic properties is certainly there, for the biologist is concerned to</page><page sequence="19">SPECIES, ESSENCES, NAMES OF NATURAL KINDS 19 explain and predict the behaviour of plants and animals, and the fundamental engines of structure and change are genetic. But the conception of a species also has at its centre the notion of a certain historical relation. That complexity of interest has, of course, emerged comparatively recently. Until biologists became preoccupied with evolution, taxonomy was an Aristotelian attempt to discover the intrinsic substantial forms that marked off one kind from another. But, particularly since the publication of The Origin of Species, biologists have become keenly interested in descent. Their account of species is an account of stable populations of interbreeding individuals, often geographically isolated from other populations, and that account is meant to fit into an overall historical picture of the descent of various populations from others by natural selection. I conclude that I am not guilty of inconsistency. I can deny that species are typically natural kinds, but resist anti-realist or instru- mentalist accounts of formal taxonomy. My account of natural kinds, and the biologist's account of species, do rather different work. My account of natural kinds is concerned exclusively with the intrinsic features, and the causal powers, of individuals. In sharp contrast, the biologist's account of species rests both on considerations about intrinsic genetic properties and on considerations about the historical relations between different groups ofindividuals. If Richard Dawkins is right,'5 the two sets of considerations are, of course, intimately connected: historical descent must be explained by natural selection, and the fundamental mechanism of natural selection is genetic. For it consists in the selection and replication of the 'successful' genes and the disappearance of the 'unsuccessful'. So it is right to interpret a formal taxonomy realistically, for it is, at least in intention, part of an account of real historical relations. And it is also right to resist promiscuous realism, for the biologist's interest in the causal powers of things, the fundamental mechanisms of change, is enough to justify the special status of formal taxonomies.'6 University of Nottingham 15 See R.
