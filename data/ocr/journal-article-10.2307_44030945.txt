<plain_text><page sequence="1">Siding with Things Sudesh Mishra (Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia) OLR In what ways and to what effect does the domination of the humanities by educational institutions of the United States affect thinking in your field and your place or places of work? Sudesh Mishra Domination immediately takes hold of me, holds me up. It strikes me as possessing an unusual degree of psychic and, therefore, semiotic intensity in the dream-work of the question. It is where the utterance attains a certain pitch of gravity. From its unassailable position, it dominates the machinery of the sentence before it even achieves the sense of domination. It does absolutely nothing to win over the other signifiers that make up the chainwork of the question: it reigns over them, exerting a formidable mastery. Consequently, it begets resent- ment, one wants to eject it from the orbit of the question, to banish it altogether because of its arrogant will-to-power. Domination is above the scandal of incorporation; it will not incorporate what it dominates and refuses to be, in turn, incorporated: it bears the telltale impress of a decree that brooks no reply. It seeks to dictate terms and therefore its relationship to any field or context can only be offensively coercive. The question begins with a clear assumption - that there is a global domina- tion of the humanities by educational institutions based in North America. It then invites discussion on whether this domination dominates or not (for this is the suggestive aspect to the question) - and in what ways and to what effect - thought regimes in my disciplinary area as well my place of employment? At this point I rise up in revolt, not against any domination of my disciplinary thinking or place of work by US institutions, but against a question that presumes that one would not have long ago rebelled in the face of such one-sided mastery. And so my response, which cannot take the simple form of a yes or no, travels a different route by taking up the more entangled issue of hegemony. The hegemonic entity exerts its influence through a mixture of coercion and consent: that much is received wisdom. It incorporates antagonism</page><page sequence="2">1 04 Oxford Literary Review to the degree that dissenters generally consent to abide by the law laid down by the entity. Expressive dissent ensures structural consent in line with the prevailing position. Any form of subversion not revolutionary in the world systems sense may be considered an epiphenomenon of hegemony. Not uncommonly, expressions of dissent are cited by the hegemonic entity as proofs of its own latitude and flexibility, thereby concealing destructive acts of authority. I shall return to this matter of hegemony shortly. First, however, an aside on another morsel of received wisdom. The ugly phrase economic rationalism' has been around for some time now; it represents the ascendant neoliberal dimension of late capitalism which seeks to exercise its hegemony on a planetary scale. Since the spectac- ular unravelling of the left in Europe and elsewhere, economic rationalists have been busy consolidating their position by fabricating a whole discourse around globalisation - fundamentally an economic idea that functions as a shorthand for capital movements not subject to nation-state regulation, but which continues to benefit oligopolies situated mostly in the overdeveloped centres. The United States is, of course, the chief testing ground and the most forceful exponent of this 'transnational' neoliberal orthodoxy that wants to, as has been said of bourgeois capital as a whole, 'nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere' (Marx and Engels, 1978, 476). It seeks out every nook and cranny of society, even the most sublime spaces of knowledge, of non-instrumental knowledge, and to suffuse them with the meretricious glow of the commodity. It strives to transform everyone into an entrepreneur or a consumer and everything into a business. Long before Australia or Britain, I expect the humanities in North America, since the US is manifestly in advance of advanced capitalism, had to justify its existence in some demystified commercial sense. In Australia, where universities are dependent on the public purse to a significant degree, the humanities had managed, by means of strategic adjustments, to put off this moment, despite all the structural changes - enforced amalgamations, to be sure - effected by the Minister for Education, John Dawkins, during the ascendancy of the Labour Party in the 1980s. Since then things have rapidly come to a head. The hard- nosed iconoclasm of the decade-old liberal government has had little tolerance for gradual strategic adjustment. Universities are under intense pressure to become financially self-sufficient, to attract funding from</page><page sequence="3">Sudesh Mishra 1 05 the private sector and charity from their alumni and to recruit fee-paying students from abroad. A recent article in The Australian observes: Australian universities are increasingly being asked to think and behave like corporations. There are a couple of reasons for this. . . Real commonwealth funding has fallen substantially. Universities are told to raise more and more money themselves: from students in Australia and overseas, and from the business sector. The bottom line is, increasingly, the dollar. The other concerns governance. Our governance systems are moving universities towards a corporate model. At the insistence of the commonwealth Government, which is intervening in the internal management of univer- sities in ways unlike any predecessor, universities are being forced to reduce the size of and reshape their governing councils or senates to fit in with a new corporate model. ( The Australian , September 6, 2006, 30) The tendency to hire academic managers and entrepreneurs (as opposed to scholars) is so widespread and deep-rooted in Australian universities as to seem almost a thing of splendour. It is rare to find an institution that possesses either the courage or the foolhardiness to make a senior level appointment, say a Head of School or Dean of Faculty, principally on scholarly merit or related non-economic grounds. This trend, which is scarcely novel, testifies to the king-tide of neoliberal ideas now inundating the tertiary sector. Perhaps the best way to illustrate the overall impact of economic rationalism on the humanities is to consider the rapid rise of what are called the creative industries and the demise of linguistics, literary studies, etc. Any area within the university that struggles to attract a prescribed number of students constitutes a financial liability and faces the possibility of painful reform, staff redundancy or plain shutdown. (In my present institution, for instance, the discipline of literary studies survives, remora-like, by feeding off creative writing and by putting most of its resources into the popular field of children's literature). Out of the ashes of financially-deficient disciplines emerge new areas that are clearly more pragmatic and market-</page><page sequence="4">1 06 Oxford Literary Review savvy and less hobbled by non-instrumental knowledge categories. It is no accident that the creative industries - creative and professional writing, visual, digital and performing arts, journalism, new media technologies (animation, games, cyber design, etc.), publishing, editing and broadcasting, music production, film-making and photography - are swiftly supplanting those interrogative domains that once exemplified, not to mention exuded, sexiness: gender, cultural and postcolonial studies. These new disciplines are not only applied and skill-based in the obvious instrumental sense, but also non-theoretical brand areas: i.e. they are designed and delivered (often electronically) for a fee-paying clientele and in direct or implied collaboration with 'industries' in the private sector. Creativity - once astonishingly at odds with the mysterious' commodity - is recast in terms recognisable to the market and easily put at its service; it now generates surplus in the twin forms of metaphor and money. If the question what is creativity (and its offshoots wit, fancy, imagination, etc.)?' once puzzled and provoked the 'greats' - Donne, Marvell, Johnson, Coleridge, Keats, etc. - it now reeks of mothballs and anachronism. For whatever it is, we all seem to have it, and the point is to profit by it. If in the past creativity was held up as an object of philosophical, aesthetic or psychoanalytical contem- plation (even Sigmund Freud had something to say on the matter), it is now an immaterial resource to be wilfully exploited. It has lost its primordial use-value, its indescribable halo, and circulates in a market system of exchange. When our private-sector guest speakers start imparting the ancient virtues of book packaging to our young writers, it is time to admit the intimate kinship between creativities, commodi- ties and corporations. None of the above is possible without hegemony. For is it not true that, like many others of my generation, I express outrage at neoliberal incursions, either covertly or through sporadic action, while simulta- neously adapting to the encroachments of the new orthodoxy? Does this, then, constitute a species of 'cynical reason in that I perpetuate the very thing that I seek to resist (Zizek, 2004, 717-19). My current status is that of a teacher of creative writing at Deakin University. This was not always so. I was trained as a literary critic and taught in English Departments (in Suva, Adelaide and Stirling) for many years, but reinvented myself, allowed myself to be reinvented, in order to secure an academic position in Australia. The situation here is such that for</page><page sequence="5">Sudesh Mishra 1 07 every position in literary studies, there are at least six in creative writing. Should I be vexed with economic pragmatists for refashioning my disciplinary subjectivity by shutting down options in my area of expertise? Or am I actually indebted to them for giving formal recogni- tion to the secret species-life of a poet? Is it, indeed, possible to forget that my acts of poetry had previously gone unnoticed for the simple reason that value happened to be calculated, at least in my last institu- tion, according to the criteria set down by a research assessment framework? Had things finally taken a turn for the better? Sadly, it took little to lay bare the ruse. In my institution acts of creativity are not worthy as acts-in-themselves but as signatures or brands of authority. My author s credential, in short, authorised me to become an instructor in the nationwide explosion of creative writing. (This explosion is at best a secondary phenomenon since it is inspired, more or less, by a decade-old trend in North America). I was hired, and allowed myself to be hired, to sell a craft not to practise it. Students turned up in droves, some understandably lured by the romance of self-expression, others seeking to bypass the rigours of archival research, and my colleagues and I processed them with due care. The situation, as it stands, is such that my union representative has taken to calling the university a 'degree factory'. It may be that his motives are ideological, polemical and tendentious, but clearly the phrase also designates a state of affairs. It names the thing as it is, relieved of connotation, and in all its grubby obviousness. For what is the present arrangement in the tertiary sector if not a form of industrial pedagogy? My status as a teacher, in short, bears fundamentally no relation to any institutional revaluation of the creative act or to any realignment of research expectations. Indeed, whats encouraged all over Australia is not disciplinary expertise but schizophrenic flexibility - an internalised division of labour regimes. The neoliberal mindset is bent on constructing its narcissistic double in the form of the academic techno- crat. This monstrous hybrid is expected to assume several discontinuous roles: it is expected to dream up and deliver profit-returning courses, to carry out research in a grant-generating target area unrelated to pedagogy, to fulfil a range of arduous administrative and service obliga- tions, and to periodically renew the creative brand-name by publishing the odd book of verse (preferably prize-winning) or by mounting an exhibition. The corporate university has secured an elusive and invalu-</page><page sequence="6">1 08 Oxford Literary Review able prize: it has successfully identified, isolated and redistributed the once-integrated labour power of the academic into discrete and exploitable sections, each working diligently towards the generation of surplus value. It has shed the archaic generation of 'tenured intransi- gents' and given birth to an expendable species of contracted sessionals' while strategically enlisting those able to reinvent themselves whenever the need arises; and this need is bound to arise in shorter spells and with greater regularity in the future. Plagued by financial uncertainties at every turn, the corporate university has little patience for the non- profitable stabilities of once-hallowed disciplines. A protean, pitiless, hyper-motivated entity, it keeps itself alive by incessantly revolution- ising and policing production, curriculum, subjectivity and delivery. It has forever altered the teacher-pupil contract by bringing that hidden third factor - money - into sharper relief. Even the idioms of our mutual obligation have been systematically restructured to register monetary forms of transaction: provider-client, deliverer-customer, purchaser-product, etc. Indeed, the petite bourgeoisie have raised their standard not so much over the ruins of the university as over a certain idea of it formerly irreducible to the exchange value system. They have, and will doubtless continue to, disintegrate and reconfigure all established social relations, whether within or outside the walls of academe, in the tireless pursuit of that mysterious surplus at the heart of the commodity. OLR What, then, is to be done? What might an 'institutional revalu- ation, as you call it, entail? How might it be effected or at least encouraged? I very much agree with what you say about the explosion of creative writing: it has been going on in the UK as well, and indeed in other European universities. But I wonder if there might also be ways of thinking and teaching this strange new 'subject' differently and, in critical respects perhaps, counter-institutionally. On the one hand we can see this as a controlled explosion, in other words creative writing as a sort of micro-version of what Althusser called an Ideological State Apparatus (though with an insidiously transnational, if essentially Anglo-American character), a predictable and easily-managed offshoot of the modern university collaborating with U.S. -dominated market values. On the other hand, the study and pursuit of creative writing take us to the heart of what a university is, of what it could or should</page><page sequence="7">Sudesh Mishra 1 09 be. 'Creative writing in this sense might become a name for that space of thinking (at once disciplinary and a-disciplinary) most explicitly and intensively given over to exploring what links together the very notions of literature, democracy and the university itself. As Derrida describes it in the essay entitled 'The University Without Condition : 'the right to say everything (or not to say everything) . . . founds both democracy and the idea of unconditional sovereignty claimed by the university' (Derrida 2002, 232). I wonder if you could say a little more about the affirmative, generative and/or resistant possibilities of this strange institu- tionalisation called creative writing . Sudesh Mishra The market may profit from the imagination, but the imagination is never wholly in bondage to the market. We must begin with this axiom if we are to answer your question and conceive of creative writing as an alternative sphere for some kind of counter-institutional endeavour within the space of the university. Althusser s thesis on the partial or relative autonomy of ideational categories affords a good point of entry. For Althusser, cultural discourses have degrees of effectivity that submit to the economic only in the last instance. (And this insight he may owe to a letter Engels wrote to Joseph Bloch.) The relationship between cultural discourses and economics is sufficiently flexible and asymmet- rical for the former to create vistas of thought unmotivated by market forces. These thoughts are not meant to be toothless day-dreams, but bearers of relative effectivity - i.e. relative to the economic mode - with some influence in the social domain. They open up possible worlds which, though tethered to economic relations in the last count, may not be quite in synch with it. What might we be able to say about creative thoughts largely out of synch with extant practices, laws, habits, discourses and realities? Might we characterise them as supplements, even remote visitants, enabling us to contemplate the becoming-body of possible' selves, societies, polities and being-worlds? Classical opinion on the creative impulse concerned precisely this sort of radical proposi- tion. As a repository of asystemic energies, it was felt that the imagination transported the poet outside existing social, structural and aesthetic orders. If we accept that there is a partial disjoint between cultural discourses and brute economic processes, then perhaps the institution of creative writing may go the other way of the detouring</page><page sequence="8">110 Oxford Literary Review supplement while serving market forces. Indeed, it may open up elsewhere' spaces not quite penetrated by commodity logic. The work of the imagination can push language to that limit where spectral forms of non-language, of events and entities that have yet to find a language, begin to manifest themselves as possibilities in language. The radical potential of creative writing lies in this sort of aporetic manoeuvre. Only when the ruminative imagination transforms Wallace Stevens's listener into a wintry nothing ('The Snow Man'), is he able to behold 'Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is' (Stevens, 1996, 1151). At one with winter, the mind ascribes the value of nothing to the season while withholding all values not equivalent to nothing. It is this sort of extreme reorientation of consciousness that permits language to stand in a radical relationship to itself and to open up the space of a truly revolutionary philosophy. Any partial disengagement of creative writing from commodity logic will have to occur, I believe, at the dramatic level of enaction as opposed to exegetical analysis. One would not want to understate the influence of commodity logic on such matters as curriculum and delivery, and the immense pressure put on universities by funding bodies to come up with profit-returning courses. Still, it is possible to pin our slight hopes on the heteroglossic field of creative texts which have the capacity to operate as counter-sites, a kind of effectively enacted utopia in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted' (Foucault, 1986, 24). Not only that, however. In harnessing the movement of the supplement, which happens to lead us astray and thence into unfamiliar territory, the imaginative work may push language to the limit, to that point where something new enters our consciousness, the becoming- body of scarcely-understood thoughts. When Zbigniew Herbert writes that the pebble is 'filled exactly / with a pebbly meaning' (Herbert, 1968, 108), he sides with the other, posits language on the side of other, the pebble, thereby creating the possibility of emptying the human from an adjective that wants to speak the non-human exactly. Language, that very human of technologies, then, may take us to the terminal point of humanity where an understanding of the non-human begins. Herbert feels a profound remorse when his touch permeates the pebble with 'false warmth', investing it with human property, because it compro- mises his ability to think at that extremity where language expresses it</page><page sequence="9">Sudesh Mishra 111 own limitation in the face of the radical other, that is, in the face of the thing without language. What might it mean for commodity logic if we were to accept the pebble as absolutely meaningful to itself, as taking place within itself and, consequently, outside all meaning as we know it? Moreover, what might be the planetary implications of such an obstinately minor question? Surely the revolutionary potential of the creative act lies in being led astray by the supplement so that we teeter on the brink of an imagina- tive chaos where many of our assumptions are in state of suspension or disarray. Good novelists, for instance, have the gift - and we must strive to keep alive the non-essentialist implications of this beautiful word - for putting themselves in the place of unlikely others. These others may be anything from character, setting or gender to culture, period or profession. Held together in the heteroglossic weave of the imaginative text, these unlikely others offer up possible worlds, and constitute the experimental arena for testing every given assumption under the sun. What would happen, for instance, if we were to invent a character for whom fasting was a form of sustenance? What would this do to our assumptions about the very conditions for organic existence? If the biological desire for food has been surmounted, what implication might it have for other types of desire, including the desire for surplus accumu- lation? When the mind is led astray by the rhizomatic supplement, what seems most remote, strange and inconsequential may be brought into some sort of (revolutionary) propinquity. It is the radical supplement that allows Emily Dickinson to speak from the impossible place of death, Wislawa Szymborska to side with a stone in its intractable stoniness, Hughes to call up the restless energy of a caged jaguar, Francis Ponge to ponder the becoming-door of a man and becoming-man of a door, and Kafka to contemplate the nourishing action of hunger. We have long been accustomed to creative writers admitting us into life-worlds, situations, viewpoints and cultures unrelated to our own. Indeed, they have made it possible for us to participate in imagined worlds without the burden of membership. Nevertheless, such forms of participation without belonging do have the potential for opening up other lives, other modes of being human and, yes, other ways of being deprived of humanity. At least in this sense every reader is the writer s double: they too subject themselves to the participatory process which has the trace effect, potentially at any rate, of extending their</page><page sequence="10">1 12 Oxford Literary Review understanding of what it means to be human in different situations. Creative writers in the past have been broadly concerned with interro- gating the various facets of human potentiality, but this is no longer, I believe, the urgent issue of the day, not by itself at any rate. It seems certain that commodity desire is a species-based death-drive without the possibility of sublimation unless we start thinking at the very limits of the human as we grasp it. Is it really possible for language to side with things from the other side, the side of non-language, non-desire and non-value extraction? What solutions might we have for the present impasse between the planet and ourselves if we stopped privileging the beingness of human beings and human modes of extentionality (ontological as well as economic), and started thinking of the irreducible meaningfulness of things-in-themselves? Is this not the most critical issue confronting the writer, reader and teacher of the language arts? OLR One of our topics here is colonized thinking. You've made it clear how deeply this sort of figure is at work today in and beyond the humanities, above all vis-à-vis commodity logic and that haunting phrase from Marx and Engels about what nestles everywhere, settles everywhere, establishes connexions everywhere'. I was also struck by your evocation, in passing, of the remora. Like 'gift', as you say, remora is a beautiful word. It is a figure of hindrance, strange lodging and commensalism, connected with 'delay' [mora]. I wonder if I could, finally, ask you to comment on another kind of remora, in other words on something which you haven't explicitly talked about, but which also seems to nestle everywhere and to be, however obliquely or surrep- titiously, at work 'colonizing thinking' today, in some ways perhaps more violently than ever. I am thinking of religion. How do you see your own teaching and writing, and your commitment to enaction', as you put it, negotiating or otherwise relating to issues of religion and religious beließ Sudesh Mishra I would want to draw a clear distinction between the creative impulse and religious belief. The latter has the literal structure of a hallucina- tion in that the human subject projects an objective entity to which it attributes causality, purpose, intentionality, design, omniscience, etc. When the products of our own mind take on an external form to which</page><page sequence="11">Sudesh Mishra 1 13 we ascribe sacred motivation, we are clearly in the realm of the fetish. It follows that all forms of fetishism, whether related to the commodity, divinity or sexuality, has the religious aspect of a profound hallucina- tion. History shows us how real acts - good, evil or indifferent - have been performed in the name of the fetish object which - and this consti- tutes the incomprehensible and tragic ruse - incites us and yet is somehow wholly and powerfully independent of us. Marx held the view that true history - and he imagined it as dynamically future-oriented and transnational in character - relieves us of all varieties of fetishism and fantasy. He was of the opinion that alienation from species-life has its basis in religious ideology which attributes to an external agent the products of human labour power. The worker, he notes, 'is related to the product of his labour as to an alien object' and 'the more powerful the alien objective world becomes which he creates over-against himself, the poorer he himself - his inner world - becomes, the less belongs to him as his own. It is the same in religion (Marx, 1978, 72). He later used this insight to demonstrate how the mystical perception of the social character of commodities is based on the displacement of a halluci- natory religious impulse. He called this the fetishism of commodities. Since it is by implication profane and heretical, the creative impulse, to my mind, lacks the hallucinatory thrust that engenders the fetish object. Once the sacred is disavowed or deprived of significance, there is no possibility of incitement from an independent entity. Good and evil emanate solely from the human subject. The so-called miraculous is nothing less than human labour power itself. The tradition of invoca- tion in poetry is profane precisely because it reverses the sacred incitement of man by god. If the poet sees things, he or she craftily ascribes the seeing to language - metaphor, prosopopoeia, so on - which produces and is a product of his own consciousness. I would want to describe the creative impulse as heretical energy that resists the halluci- natory projections of the kind implied by the fetish object. It is this energy that holds my interest - as writer-teacher - for it embodies a spirit that is counter-religious while conceding the ethical possibility of a relationship with radical others. What is ethics if not the capacity to move empathetically towards radical phenomena without yielding to the colonial' desire for annexation or to the religious dogma of mystical incitement? We find this ethical capacity for non-fetishistic reverence in the best of writers. Seen in these terms, Gerard Manley Hopkins is</page><page sequence="12">114 Oxford Literary Review not strictly a religious poet. What matters to him is boundless extention- ality - the springing up - of the creative-alliterative spirit (in shook foil, wimpling wing, silk-sack clouds, etc.) and not the edicts of a fetish object. Perhaps I imagine a type of enlightened animism that permits us to extend towards the non-extractive meaningfulness of things-in- themselves. As life is to death, so language is to non-language. It is life that permits us to relate to that which it cannot ever be - death. We know that death terminates all relationship with oneself and others, but this possibility which ends all possibilities can only manifest itself in life. Correspondingly, it is language that permits us to relate to that which it cannot be, to the thing-without-language. In naming a name language may name the impossibility of the naming process itself. It may take us to the limit of the signifying function by saying what it is that it cannot say. At the terminal point of the signifying function is that which is absolutely and radically other to language. To put it another way: we grasp in language the possibility of not-grasping itself. Take the case of the word sublime', for instance. It names an affective- aesthetic experience whose meaning eludes the name itself. At the limit point of the signifying function, then, is an absolute difference which we grasp as not-grasped. Emmanuel Lévinas comments that the otherness of the other is absolute and without explanation and that an ethical inviolability' must feature in any relationship we keep with the others non-relatedness (Lévinas, 2002, 516). For too long we have shirked the ethical dimension opened up by the limit case. Out of an anthropocentric habit, we have attempted to 'colonize' the other's absolute difference either through fetishism and anthropomorphism or through value attribution and extraction. But what if we were to put language on the side of absolute difference where it came up against the other in its immutable indifference to the human? What would it mean to let things be since that is an ethical precondition for dealing with absolute difference? Listen to Szymborska: We call it a grain of sand, But it calls itself neither grain nor sand. It does just fine without a name, Whether general, particular, Permanent, passing, Incorrect, or apt.</page><page sequence="13">Sudesh Mishra 1 15 Our glance, our touch mean nothing to it. It doesn't feel itself seen and touched. And that it fell on the windowsill Is only our experience, not its. For, it is no different from falling on anything else With no assurance that it has finished falling Or that it is falling still. (Szymborska, 1996, 135) Given the scale of the crisis facing the planet, it behoves the creative spirit to revive the primal capacity for non-extractive wonder where the radical difference of the other at the limit point of language elicits the ethical response of letting the other be in and for itself. And that, I feel, is an obligation emptied of all religious significance. References Foucault, Michel (1988), 'Of Other Spaces', Diacritics, 16, 1, 22-21 .
