<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religious discourse and first person authority Terry F Godlove, Jr. Abstract Competent speakers are normally authoritative as to the meaning of their words. Increasingly students of religion seem to be discounting this "first person authority claiming that religious persons are not - as they seem to be - talking about what Hume called "invisible intelligent powers", gods, goddesses, ancestors, angels, and the like. This interpretative stance has understandably drawn criticism. I argue that the force of first person authority is diminished in religious discourse, and that this explains why it is so widely discounted. My argument turns on a broadly externalist account of linguistic meaning. When we view linguistic meaning as somehow "in the head" of the speaker, the interpreter will be set the incoherent task of trying to extract it with a minimum of distortion. But by viewing the meaning of words as emerging from the circumstances, mental and physical, and of their use, we may uncover the basis of first person authority and come to understand why its place in religious discourse has proved elusive. The study of religion, as I understand it, shares the basic aim of the other branches of the human sciences. It aims, as they do, to understand the beliefs, actions, and values of persons. What makes the study of religion distinctive - if perhaps not unique - is that the beliefs, actions, and values at stake typically have to do with, in David Hume's apt phrase, "invisible, intelligent powers", with angels, ancestors, demons, spirits, gods, goddesses, and all the rest. Many times "have to do" cashes out without remainder as poetry, song, dance, myth, metaphysics, or metaphor. But religious people very often seem to speak as if they believe these creatures to exist, and therein lies a problem, for as far as we observers can tell, they do not. Not that all disagreement or apparent error leads to interpretive problems. There is no problem - to take one of Wayne Proudfoot's examples (1985: 216) - about interpreting the hiker's exclamation, "There's a bear'", although we can see he is looking at a partially obscured log. By contrast, many people - perhaps most influentially, Ludwig Wittgenstein - have felt that there often is a problem in attributing Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 0943-3058 6-2 (1994), pp. 147-161 © Walter de Gruyter, Berlin</page><page sequence="2">148 Terry F Godlove, Jr to someone the belief that voodoo really works or that the king is related by kinship to a grove of trees or that god became man. Recently, philosophers, linguists, and social scientists have had much to say about the attribution of error. This subject's cross-disciplinary appeal is unsurprising, for it naturally falls at the intersection of interpretation theory and epistemology While I will shortly take up aspects of this debate, for now, I simply want to observe that many scholars of religion seem to have aligned themselves with Wittgenstein in tending to construe what sound like straightforward assertions about invisible, intelligent powers as neither true nor false. The question becomes: What do religious people really mean when they seem to be talking about invisible, intelligent beings? Or: What are they really doing9 Today we have plenty of theoretical perspectives from which to choose when attempting to answer these questions. To mention only a few, we have continuing contributions from various forms of critical theory (Bataille 1989; Blumenberg 1983), functionalism (Douglas 1966; Turner 1967), psychoanal ysis (Jones 1991, Meisner 1984), structuralism (Penner 1989- part 2), ethnol ogy (Staal 1989), deconstruction (Taylor 1987), cognitive linguistics (Sperber 1975; Lawson - McCauley 1990; for a discussion of important differences between these two works see Godlove 1993), social ecology (Smith 1987; Bell 1992), Kantian-style and other comparative moral theories (for the for mer see Green 1978; 1988; for the latter, Little - Twiss 1978), socio-biology (Wilson 1978: chapter 8), a newly resurgent, sophisticated venficatiomsm (Martin 1990), and from neo-Wittgensteinian theologians who urge us to treat religious traditions as "language-games" (Lmdbeck 1984). Perhaps the only important feature which these diverse approaches share is the assump tion that, m the nature of the case, religious people are often not talking about what they claim or appear to be talking about, namely, invisible, intelligent powers. In fact, the common assumption is that we interpreters are often in a better position than they are to know the true significance of their words. To use the phrase common in the current literature, all these theories often seem to deny persons their usual "first person authority" (see, for example, Burge 1979; 1982; 1986; Davidson 1984b; 1987). From the standpoint of theory and method, the apparent widespread denial of first person authority seems to me to be one of the most striking aspects of the contemporary study of religion. In what follows, I discuss the nature and ground of first person authority, and ask why scholars of religion appear to deny it with such regularity</page><page sequence="3">Religious discourse and first person authority 149 1. The edible God Ordinarily, competent speakers are authoritative about the meaning of their own words. This fact seems to be traceable in some way to the directness of the evidence language-users have concerning their own speech. We do not normally have to listen to our words in order to interpret them. This imme diacy sets us apart from our audience. Our listeners must gather evidence through their senses - their interpretations are based on a complex set of hypotheses and background assumptions that undergo constant, if generally unnoticed, revision. And, of course, such listeners can only marshall their evidence after witnessing each successive speech act. By contrast, the insight competent speakers have into the meaning of their own speech-behaviour is, as a rule, neither so hypothetical nor so tardy As competent speakers, we are authoritative about the meaning of the vast bulk of our words. As competent interpreters, we ordinarily presume and do our best, all things being equal, to preserve one another's first person authority To note this common phenomenon is of course not to explain or justify it. What, then, is its basis, and why is it so often allowed to lapse in the academic study of religion? Hume was perhaps first in pointing the way toward a serious treatment of these issues. In his Natural History of Religion (1957" 55-56), he tells the story of a young Turkish prisoner, who was taken to the Sorbonne for instruction. It seems that some of the priests solicited Mustapha very hard to turn Christian, and promised him, for his en couragement, plenty of good wine in this world, and paradise in the next. These allurements were too powerful to be resisted; and therefore, having been well instructed and catechized, he at last agreed to receive the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper. The pnest, however, to make everything sure and solid, still continued his instructions, and began the next day with the usual question, How many Gods are there? None at all, replies Benedict; for that was his new name. How? None at all! cries the priest. To be sure, said the honest proselyte. You have told me all along that there is but one God: And yesterday I eat him. Nearly everyone - including Hume - would agree that, whatever the priest meant by the term "God", he did not mean the wafer. And probably a majority would even say that the boy made a mistake in taking that as the priest's intended meaning. But the second judgment is, I think, just what Hume wants to put in doubt. Let us ask how the boy has arrived at his humorous interpretation of the priest's discourse. We may imagine some such scene as this: the boy is seated before the priest, who is explaining the significance of the sacrament. In the course of his explanation, the priest now and then makes this sound, "God"</page><page sequence="4">150 Terry F Godlove, Jr Further, at those times when the priest makes this sound - for simplicity's sake, let us say at only those times - he handles and directs his attention to the holy wafer. In time, the boy comes to take this pairing as more than coincidental; that is, he comes to hold the sound "God" applicable when - and only when - in the presence of the wafer. And this is as much as to say that he learns that the word "God" refers to, and means, the wafer. Accepting something like this reconstruction, we may now reconsider whether the boy has made a mistake in interpreting the priest's "God" Whatever our eventual verdict, certainly some such learning process - one involving the pairing of verbal behaviour to publicly observable objects and events - does play a crucial role m our everyday assignments of reference and meaning. This point has recently been emphasized by a number of philoso phers, including Hilary Putnam (1975: 227), whose thought experiments are designed to show that, as he has famously put it, "meanings just ain't in the head" Writing m the same spirit, Donald Davidson (1987- 450) notes that "a sentence someone is inspired (caused) to hold true by and only by sightings of the moon is apt to mean something like 'there's the moon', the thought expressed is apt to be that the moon is there" Davidson's claim is that, at least in "basic cases", we must take the cause of a belief also to be its object. With Putnam's slogan in mind - that "meanings just ain't in the head" - we can mount a pretty fair defense of the boy's interpretation. He has focused, after all, on the one aspect of the environment that he can see - and that he has every reason to think that the priest also sees - is reliably tied to the priest's discourse. In his approach to interpretation Mustapha is a good behaviourist, and, as Quine has long emphasized (1992: 38), in that he joins the rest of us. As long as our command of the language fits all external checkpoints, where our utterance or our reaction to someone else's utterance can be appraised in light of some shared situation, all is well. Our mental life between checkpoints is indiffer ent to our rating as master of the language. There is nothing in linguistic meaning beyond what is to be gleaned from overt behaviour in observable circumstances. As far as Mustapha could tell, his own wafer-talk was behavioral indis tinguishable from the priest's God-talk.1 And, for Mustapha and Quine, that exhausts the notion of sameness of meaning. But we can further sharpen the boy's defense. We can well imagine that the priest's verbal behaviour cannot be correlated with any change m the environment except that involving the wafer. Some such result would be no ' But see Davidson 1986: 318: "Communication begins where causes converge: your utterance means what mine does if belief in its truth is systematically caused by the same events and objects." It is perhaps worth emphasizing - what Quine and Davidson repeatedly note - that endorsing behaviourism in interpretation does not commit one to it in psychology or in the theory of meaning.</page><page sequence="5">Religious discourse and first person authority 151 surprise. For it is a matter of orthodoxy in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam that speech about God cannot be paired with an actual, physical appearance; though intelligent and powerful, God is immaterial. But more radically, there is not even any indirect correlation to be had; the deity leaves no trace - at least no public trace, and, in the context of interpretation, such traces are what we require - they allow us to infer its properties. God is, so to speak, more invisible than a magnetic field or a sub-atomic particle. These considerations should, it seems to me, generate no little sympathy for the boy's interpretation, even if we do not want to go so far as to conclude that the priest's use of "God" really meant wafer (that the boy was flat-out right). But some will be unmoved. Surely, they will say, the boy has just failed in his attempt to grasp correctly the meaning of "God" operative within the priest's linguistic community Since the priest was a competent member of that community, and intended his words to be understood in the way he knew to be standard within that community, his words are correctly interpreted only when understood in that standard sense. Whatever that standard sense is, that is both what the priest's words meant and (given his intentions) what the priest meant by his words, and that is what the boy - perhaps through no fault of his own - failed to master. At issue here is the difficult question of whether speakers' words must always be given the meaning they have in their own speech community We may agree that speakers must intend to be understood as they want, and that this will promote uniformity in interpretation, since competent speak ers know from experience that they cannot typically interpret other speakers from scratch (Davidson 1987- 449; Burge 1982: 289) (and competent hear ers know that competent speakers know this, and also know that competent speakers know that competent hearers know that competent speakers know this). Further, speakers can only have this intention if they expect their lis teners to grasp how they (the speakers) want to be interpreted. (I assume that a speaker cannot intend to be understood as he wishes by a hearer he knows or believes cannot so interpret him - that, more generally, we cannot intend to do what we know or believe to be impossible.) What, then, has gone awry between the priest and Mustapha - if anything has7 We must distinguish between three points of view From the priest's van tage point, he may justly claim to be authoritative about what his words mean. He is a member in good standing of a speech community within which the words he used carry just the standard meaning that he intended them to in spire (assuming of course that his "God-talk" has a standard intra-community meaning, that it is not, for example, a deliberate misuse of language). From Mustapha's point of view, Mustapha can only appeal to the best principles of interpretation he knows in decoding both the meaning of the speaker's sounds and what the speaker meant by making those sounds then and there. I</page><page sequence="6">152 Terry F Godlove, Jr have already suggested that it is at least plausible that Mustapha has fully dis charged that obligation. While it would not be plausible to hold that the boy's interpretive resources should confer a non-standard meaning to the priest's words (that they could somehow reach out and override the speaker's inten tions), it does not follow that the boy has violated the priest's first person authority by interpreting his words in (from the priest's point of view) a non standard way If, in forming his interpretation of the priest's words, the boy has appealed to principles of interpretation that are, under the circumstances, defensible, what sense can there be in concluding that he has made a mistake or that he has violated anything9 Lastly, we come to our own point of view as - relative to the exchange between Mustapha and the priest - well-informed observer-interpreters. We can see that the priest's expectation that the boy would understand his words m the standard (intended) sense was spectacularly ill-founded. The priest expected to be understood in a way that he should have known was, at the very least, unlikely Further, it was unlikely for the apparent reason that he had not given the boy sufficient clues to prompt the understanding that he intended (here assuming that we have somehow gleaned clues sufficient to enable our appreciation of a gap between the two). The priest's theory about the boy's theory about the priest's theory of meaning was wildly mistaken. If anyone has failed, it is the priest. Having beaten Hume's little story pretty well to a pulp, let me extract three morals. First, the prime casualty of Mustapha's collision with the priest is the notion that there exists one correct interpretation of a speaker's words - a notion associated with the further thesis that words have meaning m them selves, apart from the conditions, mental and physical, surrounding their use. These two ideas in turn go hand in hand with the thought that linguistic meaning is somehow in the heads of speakers, and that the interpreter's job is somehow to get inside the speaker's head in order to extract it with a mini mum of distortion. Hume's story illustrates, on the contrary, Putnam's slogan that "meanings just ain't m the head" For here, a bit of the world (the wafer), a speaker, and an interpreter clever enough to notice a connection between the first two have all conspired to produce a defensible interpretation. It may be objected that Mustapha worked from an evidential base that was simply too thin - that, while he may be epistemically justified in his interpretation, it is simply false. But that would be to miss the deeper point that, under even optimal conditions, the interpretation of speech (and non-linguistic be haviour) will always involve balancing the same sorts of considerations that Mustapha had to consider, according to maxims that often must undergo con tinual adjustment.2 Far from having direct access to a speaker's beliefs and 21 have in mind in particular the so-called principle of chanty, in all its multifaceted glory.</page><page sequence="7">Religious discourse and first person authority 153 theory of meaning, we must construct each of them on the basis of the other. From an interpreter's point of view, the product of this constructive activity is all there is to the notion of a speaker's beliefs and meanings. In that sense, there simply was no fact of the matter for Mustapha to get right or wrong.3 I take it that this is one way to approach Quine's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation or Davidson's variation on it, the indeterminacy of interpretation. Second, discourse ostensibly about an invisible, intelligent power is hard to interpret because its component sentences are held true under any and all observable circumstances. Whatever goes on in the world, still, "the Re deemer liveth", and, "there is but one God" With respect to environmental change, the discourse of (at least) abstract monotheism is indifferent. But this very indifference flaunts what is apparently basic to the interpretation of verbal behaviour - namely, our ability to identify the object or event which systematically prompts an utterance with what that utterance is about. By refusing to be paired, even indirectly, with an aspect of the environment, dis course about invisible, intelligent powers tries to be meaningful exclusively "in the head" Third, and finally, reflection on Hume's tale suggests a first, rough answer to the question concerning why scholars of religion often appear to run rough shod over first person authority For why are competent speakers generally authoritative about the meaning of their words9 If we agree to the externalist position and take the meaning of a word to be fixed (at least in basic cases) by the aspect of the world that prompts the word's use, then the answer is clear. Speakers can be certain of the meaning of their words because whatever they regularly apply them to gives them their meaning. Then, to doubt the general validity of first person authority is to doubt that competent speakers For discussion see Gauker 1986. I have explored some of the issues that arise in incorporating chanty into the interpretation of religious discourse in Godlove 1989: chapter 4; and 1992. 3 For a discussion of the nature and sources of evidence in interpretation see Fpllesdal 1986: 117-220. I am ignoring the question to what extent communication by means of language involves interpretation. According to Dummett, it "is of necessity an exceptional occurrence" In the normal case, the speaker simply says what he means. By this I do not mean that he first has the thought and then puts it into words, but that, knowing the language, he simply speaks. In the normal case, likewise, the hearer simply understands. That is, knowing the language, he hears and thereby understands; given that he knows the language, there is nothing that his understanding the words consists in save hearing them. There are, of course, many exceptional cases. (Dummett 1986: 471) Those who side with Dummett here will view the encounter between Mustapha and the priest as an "exceptional case" Those who, agreeing with Davidson and Quine, see interpretation as an essential moment in linguistic communication, will generalize their encounter across the board. I pass over this issue because either position could accommodate my treatment of Mustapha's theological education.</page><page sequence="8">154 Terry F Godlove, Jr generally know what is prompting them to use the words they are using. But, for all but the Cartesian sceptic, that doubt will seem far-fetched.4 Taking, then, the basis of first person authority to be "outside the head" in something like the way that I have outlined, our question is whether it extends to talk of invisible, intelligent power. We must ask: What aspect of the world prompts, directly or indirectly, use of the word "God'"' In the limiting case of the thoroughly abstract, immaterial deity, the answer is: nothing, no-thing. But, on the line we are pursuing, it is just this prompting that makes for first person authority Thus, by eschewing a semantic natural history - by trying to purchase its meaning strictly "in the head" - talk of an abstract, immaterial deity denies itself the very basis of first person authority While these remarks are in many respects incomplete,5 they suggest, I believe, why scholars of religion often seem not to let religious people speak for themselves. 2. The natural history of "God" I have so far referred to the thoroughly abstract god - perhaps Tillich's "God above the God of theism" - as a limiting case. But of course most gods and goddesses, devils and demons, are more substantial than this. In part to drive home just this contrast, Hume's Natural History traces the ironic degeneration of religion from polytheistic nature-worship to abstract monotheism. Hume's point is that belief in, for example, the solar god can be understood because it has a specifiable natural history - that is, a causal trail traceable outside the head of the worshipper. Thus, we notice that worshippers turn toward the sun when they utter the word "sun" Here we can easily make the sort of connection between speaker and world that in turn tends to make for the strongest first person authority By contrast, the field linguist out to interpret 4 The thought that we might be systematically mistaken about what features of the world, on given occasions, prompt our application of concepts, may also tempt persons who think that reference to an object is fixed by essential features of that object. Such persons may hold that, in pointing to the colourless, odourless, potable, universal solvent in the local trout stream, my "water" refers to water only if that liquid has the requisite molecular structure (H20). The systematic doubt might then be taken to anse because no finite language-user is in a position to verify the molecular structure of the objects around her as she speaks. These issues are beyond the scope of the present paper. For discussion see Knpke 1979. 5 In particular, I have said nothing that ought to persuade the person who thinks my position reflects nothing more than empiricist prejudice - who thinks that it is just a brute fact that lots of religious (and other) people do hold beliefs about invisible, intelligent powers. This person may feel that my error stems from the unwarranted assumption that the content of a belief has something to do with its relation to things. (I owe this reminder to Tony Dardis.) In this paper, I am simply diagnosing some issues surrounding first person authority in the contemporary study of religion from the point of view of what seems to me a very plausible picture of linguistic interpretation. I have not defended that picture or even filled in its details.</page><page sequence="9">Religious discourse and first person authority 155 speech about a thoroughly abstract god does not have this advantage - that was what made for Mustapha's predicament and what called for his ingenuity An invisible, intelligent power cannot have a causal history that identifies it as an invisible, intelligent power - and so interpretation of speech about it is, if perhaps not impossible, inherently problematic. For my purposes, Hume's contrast between polytheistic nature-worship and abstract monotheism is crucial. On the line I am urging, we ought to find that theories of nature-religions rely, for interpretive purposes, on the evident causal contexts of the beliefs they aim to decode. And this is in fact the case, for each of the two main competing meta-theoretical stances found in the modern literature. Thus, the so-called intellectualist model follows Hume in making nature-worship a kind of proto-science, seeing it as primarily a means-end or instrumental mode of behaviour. Champions of this view include Robin Horton and, at times, Bronislaw Malinowski. But even if we endorse the competing model - the symbolist approach - we will still not have lost sight of the literal. The symbolist - say, Edmund Leach, Talcott Parsons, John Beattie or, in a recent book, Stanley Tambiah (1990) - counsels us to decode the symbolic significance of religious belief, the one that lies beneath the overt meaning. But then of course the symbolist has not denied the importance of the literal interpretation of the belief; in fact it is crucial, precisely as that which must be decoded. The point is that, for both of these approaches, nature-worship is intelli gible - is interpretable - because of the agent's interaction with aspects of the shared, public environment. We may and ought to let polytheistic nature worshippers speak for themselves. Or, rather than us, it is the world, in the form of the public objects (suitably anthropomorphized) they worship, that allows them to speak for themselves - even if, with the symbolists, we are inclined not to rest content with what they say As before, the theme is that "meaning ain't in the head" By contrast, it is not so clear how we are to let believers in thoroughly immaterial deities speak for themselves. Just as objective features of the world - the sun, the moon, and so on - tend to make possible the interpretation of nature religions, so their absence tends to block our understanding of, for example, classical monotheism. The problem is age-old: how to understand talk about a god who is said to be, for example, intelligent and yet completely immaterial and undetectable. Let me emphasize that I do not say that it cannot be done. From early on, what we know today as philosophical theology has been preoccupied with showing that we finite humans can sensibly talk about an invisible, intelligent power. To this end, theologians and philosophers have constructed ingenious conceptions of God and equally ingenious accounts of linguistic reference. In the Christian tradition, one thinks of Augustine's appeal in the Confessions</page><page sequence="10">156 Terry F Godlove, Jr to the image of light, or of Aquinas' discussion of analogical predication; in recent times, we have the panentheistic deity of process metaphysics and the suggestion that all language is, at bottom, metaphorical. All of these theories try to show that human speech can, to some degree, bridge the gap between divinity and humanity But let us grant these theories complete success; still, they show at most the abstract possibility of referring to an invisible, intelligent power. As Hume's tale vividly illustrates, they establish nothing about whether a given interpreter's construal of a given bit of speech behaviour is justified. Put differently, philosophical theology rarely has any role to play in our understanding of religious speech and action.6 We should expect, then, to find that first person authority is strongest in the nature-religions and weakest in the abstract monotheisms. Now this dis tinction is obviously crude and far from exhaustive. The lunar god and the ineffable god above god anchor opposite ends of a spectrum filled out by a familiar cast of religious characters - what Hume calls "middle beings" - angels, ancestors, demons, the holy spirit, and the like. It would be a mis take to look for a definite place where talk about such things ceases to be meaningful, for the data is too diverse and the talents of the interpreter too variable. By way of generalization, we can say only that, as religious per sons ascend the scale of abstractness they tend to forfeit the right to speak for themselves; similarly, the power of speech returns to the extent that they embrace anthropomorphism and thereby supply the local deity (etc.) with an identifiable trail within the world of public objects and events. The basic claim is that the strength of a person's authority over the mean ing of his or her words varies with the interpreter's ability to appreciate their natural history, to unearth their systematic - even if subtle and indirect - ties to the world that all language-users must share. This is to be expected, for it is just such a tie that gives the words their meaning. We should find, then, what we do find - that talk of the angels is more secure than is talk of the holy spirit; speech about the continuing activity of our revered ancestors is more readily interpreted than is talk about the god beyond the god of theism. In sum, first person authority turns out to be a matter of degree. It ranges over a gradient formed, roughly, by the degree of abstractness claimed for the putative object of a belief, action, or value. If something like this is right, then among all those pursuing one or another of the human sciences, scholars of religion are best prepared to ap preciate the ebb and flow of first person authonty For they are trained to deal on a daily basis with a range of more or less abstract beings and so - in order to give religious persons their rightful semantic authority - have had to be 6 "Rarely" recognizes those instances in which we require the philosophical theologian's help in understanding a conversation between philosophical theologians.</page><page sequence="11">Religious discourse and first person authority 157 come skilled in the arts of taste, sympathy, intuition, and imaginative surmise (Davidson 1984a: 279; 1984b: 438). But no amount of training or sympathy on the part of the interpreter can confer authority to a speaker where none is warranted. If Putnam, Davidson, and others are right that "meaning just ain't in the head", then even the omniscient interpreter will stumble over talk of a thoroughly immaterial, intelligent power (even God cannot interpret god talk). Like the boy who thought he had eaten God, of course we interpreters must do our best to understand the priest as he wishes to be understood. But, also like Mustapha, we must be ready to accept what our best evidence dictates. We cannot be blamed for appealing to interpretive principles which are themselves wholly defensible. 3. Reductionism and the first person authority Recently, some influential voices from within the religious studies commu nity have alleged the widespread abuse of first person authority and have called for reform. Perhaps the most eloquent and powerful of these has been Robert Wilken's, contained in his 1989 Presidential Address to the American Academy of Religion. Wilken writes (1989- 707): When we allow the 'ostensible' meaning of religious language to be taken hostage to the etiquette of disinterested secondary discourse, or to things that have only a tangential relation to things religious people care about, not only do we prune the list of things we talk about, we also narrow the circle of people we will talk to, or better, of those who will talk to us. And that is a great loss, a kind of self-imposed deafness.7 I shall close by considering some aspects of Wilken's charge. Wilken seems to be targeting those guilty of what Proudfoot terms "descriptive re ductionism" It is one thing to assign content to a belief, something else to explain how its holder came to hold its content true. When we attempt the former, an important touchstone of success will be the subject's agreement with our assignment - vigorous protest will likely be enough by itself to make us re-think our theory of his understanding of his words (and perhaps our theory of his theory of our theory of his understanding of his words). But, having once satisfied ourselves on this score, there is no methodologi cal reason why we cannot then pursue explanatory reductionism, that is, to explain the holding of the belief m terms that our subject may dispute just as vigorously (Proudfoot 1985: chapter 6). In so far as Wilken is condemning descriptive reductionism, we can only add our voices to his. 71 have pursued other aspects of Wilken's charge in Godlove (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="12">158 Terry F Godlove, Jr However, in considering Wilken's charge, we must remember that the belief in invisible, intelligent power presents a built-in obstacle to the (from the speaker's point of view) exercise and (from the interpreter's standpoint) recognition of first person authority - or so I have been urging. This means that, before applying Proudfoot's distinction to alleged cases of abuse, we will have to be doubly sure that first person authority has already been established beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, Proudfoot notes of the person who mistakes the log for the bear that - on pain of descriptive reductionism - we must describe his fear as of a bear. The clarity and force of the example - that is, the strength and vividness of this person's first person authority - denves from our prior confidence in our ability to match up a piece of behaviour (the frightened exclamation) with a piece of the world (the log). ("Meaning just ain't m the head.") For just this reason we will almost certainly want the person who worships the lunar god to speak for him or herself. This person cannot mean to be speaking of, say, society, however striking the Durkheimian correlation we observe between her belief-formation and the gathering of her clan. For the nature of the situation in which the person learned to use the term "moon" - that is, the objective presence of the moon - will exert a powerful methodological pressure to prevent us from assigning any meaning and reference to the term other than the one the speaker claims for it. (We are free, as I have noted, to pursue its symbolic significance - we may well decide that has nothing to do with the anthropomorphized moon. My comments are neutral as between the intellectualist and symbolist stances.) On the other hand, interpreters of, for example, the abstract monotheisms do not face this methodological pressure m so potent a form. For there, as I have been suggesting, the presumption of first person authority has likely been weakened, if it has not lapsed altogether. It has likely been weakened because the causal context that grounds first person authority is in principle absent, or nearly so. At issue is not the interpreter's own belief, disbelief, or agnosticism, nor - at this point - is there any question of descriptive reductionism. Rather, the very methodology of interpretation guarantees the so-called primitive nature religions an interpretive advantage over their more abstract cousins, in the sense that devotees of the former will naturally be counted as more authoritative than those of the latter concerning the meaning of their words. While the relevance of this consideration must of course be judged case by case, this, I think, should be the basic line of defense for the interpreter of religious discourse who feels wrongly accused of violating first person authority Having sketched a line of defense, I would like to offer a counter-charge. There is, I think, a danger in an over-zealous respect for first person authority The danger is that it may become what Proudfoot has called a "protective strategy", serving apologetic interests. It may be possible for humans to speak</page><page sequence="13">Religious discourse and first person authority 159 meaningfully of an invisible, intelligent power; and Wilken and others are right that the religious traditions themselves have offered ingenious theories about how that might be so. But the more resolute our allegiance to such theories, the more likely we are to become insensitive to, or even to ignore, both the often subtle and surprising causal contexts of the behaviour that confronts us, and the welter of ever-present competing and complementary maxims that govern responsible interpretive practice. (One example: only when Wittgenstein [1979- 4] stopped asking whether a certain people really believe that the rain-king can make rain did he notice that they only petition for rain in the rainy season.) It would be an interesting question - though one which I cannot pursue here - to determine to what extent modern students of religion have been distracted by the effort to understand how a speaker can use a vocalization, "God", perhaps, to refer to an invisible, intelligent power. Proudfoot (1985) and Hans Penner (1989' part 1) have recently argued persuasively that the detour has been great. When we as scholars of religion insist that "God" and its kin be assigned religious content we risk forgetting what Dagfinn Fpllesdal (1986: 117) has called the "hypothetical element" m all our perception of human action. We risk forgetting that, with further evidence, we may be led to see a different intentional action or even a bodily movement explainable in purely physical terms. I hope to have made plausible the suggestion that religious discourse is inherently liable to being seen, in Fpllesdal's sense, anew I suggest that that liability at least partially explains the apparent violation of first person authority suggested by the welter of theoretical perspectives I listed at the outset. By doggedly pursuing the presumed theological content of "god"-talk, scholars of religion nsk ignoring its all too tangible natural history But now we have come full-circle: If first person authority rests on our appreciation of just these natural-historical connections, to ignore them would be the most profound form of scholarly deafness.8 Hofstra University References Bataille, Georges (1989).
