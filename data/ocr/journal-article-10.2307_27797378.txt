<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL EDUCATION IN FINDE SIECLE AMERICA: TOWARD A POSTMODERN APPROACH Michael C. Parker Part 3: Examining the Pedagogy and Content of General Education In part 1 of this essay, I compared modernism and postmodernism as sequential moments in the social evolution of the Western in tellectual tradition. I briefly examined the warrant for the postmodern distinction of a discontinuity between the modern and postmodern and posed some questions as to what the social val ues of postmodernism might be and whether they might be salient to general education. Several arguments are commonly made that we are in the middle of a sea change away from modernity. First, since World War II, digital technologies have been changing the ways we think, interact, work, and play. Second, entertainment industries have turned current events into sensation-seeking dis tractions and amusements and made entertainments so real that they blur the distinction between simulation and reality. Third, the arts and literature, appreciating the social construction of knowledge and values, have developed a self-referential irony that questions and throws into doubt all beliefs. Finally, when academia is examined from the postmodern vantage point, ques tions of the legitimacy of knowledge and learning come to the foreground and the possibility of general education is questioned. In part 2,1 shifted the focus from modernism and postmodernism as a social distinction to a distinction about the nature of knowl edge claims. I examined the discontinuities between the modern project of searching for the basic nature of things and the post modern claim that such a search is misguided. I also examined science's claim that the normative and rhetorical can be separated from its discourse and argued that it cannot. Postmodernism chal lenges the idea that the world of knowledge consists of disciplines, of distinct methods and their application to produce truth and that JGE: THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION, Vol. 47, No. 3, 1998. Copyright ? 1998 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA.</page><page sequence="2">196 Parker general education is the interpretation of a canon by professors and to students. It is ironic, the postmoderns argue, that in our search for universal truth, our own critical powers seem to dem onstrate that we cannot make noncontingent, nonpositional claims about anything. After reviewing the nature of this contingency, I identified questions about the implications for reconceptualizing general education. In part 3, I speculate about the pedagogy and content of a gen eral education curriculum influenced by postmodern assumptions about society, the academy, and knowledge. I suggests a more flex ible curriculum, focusing upon the skills needed for adapting to accelerating change as well as for preserving traditions. In addi tion, I suggests ways that the balkanization of the disciplines should be overcome in general education if critical thinking and problem solving skills are to be the powerful tools needed in the world ahead. In the first two essays in this series I have argued that social changes and discoveries about knowledge make it difficult to think of general education as we have previously. We tend to think of general education as the sharing of the liberal tradition and pro viding the intellectual and social knowledge, skills, and values needed to maintain that tradition; we also think of it as the fund of great ideas and useful metaphors to make sense of and enjoy the world around us. Behind such notions is the belief that through general education we study the universal and foundational knowl edge needed for a basic understanding of nature, culture and our place in it. The Western intellectual tradition has long been chang ing, however. Heliocentric cosmology decentered renaissance thinkers and exposed anthropomorphism for what it was?we were not at the center of the universe, nor were we its purpose?and inquiry was never the same. The twentieth-century understanding of the contingency of history and culture exposed both ethnocen trism and male domination in ways that further decentered the Western intellectual tradition and again changed inquiry. Appre ciation of the constructive and political nature of language and theory has cast further doubts upon our ability to conceive of gen eral knowledge as we have. Now the social changes brought about by accelerating technology and instant information may be creat ing yet another discontinuity in inquiry. The future does not seem to be emerging simply as postindustrialism or postcapitalism and</page><page sequence="3">Fin de Si?cle America 197 the fulfillment of the modern project of a democratic utopia. Our tradition of the separation of knowledge into the objective and the normative is challenged, and even the utility of the modern West ern way is in doubt. It appears that general education may have to prepare students for an unprecedented world, a world in which interpreting the modern canon?as we have done for a century or more?will be inadequate. A Contingent General Education Twentieth-century thought has made it all but impossible for us to claim General Education as an uppercase designation for eternal knowledge. If, however, we think of general education as a pro visional and critical examination of the ideas and ways of know ing that our community holds dear, then the name should be spelled lower case. We have much to offer through a general education program, not because knowledge is certain, but because of what we can know and do although our knowledge is necessarily lim ited. We can appreciate the irony of our knowledge claims: we want to make absolute claims about truth although our individual grip on truth is local and limited by feedback; we want to state truths about reality although truth is only a property of language? a compliment we sometimes pay to the efficacy of the language tool (Rorty, 1989, chap. 1). We want to make claims about reality although we can never get outside our skins?all our observa tions are mediated by our embodiment, our peculiar neural sen sory apparatus. We want to make claims about human nature al though we can never escape enmeshment in a particular culture at a single historical moment. We want to make absolute claims about ethics although we can never transcend our shared stories about particular conduct and its consequences in a particular con text and why it mattered to us (Rorty, 1995, p. 12). What kind of general education would address the social and epistemological issues posed by postmodernism? First, our gen eral education must emphasize that knowledge is?contrary to the Western intellectual tradition?contingent. The power of disci plines is not their special method or access to reality, but the judg ment of their community about the current importance of what we call the successes of each "discipline." The disciplines emerge</page><page sequence="4">198 Parker and survive to the extent that they have an innovative way to deal with our ongoing problems and help us adapt. What is unique about American general education is not the way it captures truth, but the way it emphasizes our hopes and places the test of truth in future action rather than in eternal absolutes. John Dewey, in Phi losophy and Civilization (1931), emphasizes that inquiry's task is to reconcile the "stubborn past and the insistent future." This may be the central value of the things that "postmodernism" emphasizes. The structure of modern higher education was developed as part of the ongoing discourse about method and the justification for foundational knowledge. To the antique disciplines of logic, math ematics, rhetoric, history, language, literature, and art were added the empirical sciences. In the late 1800s, engineering, econom ics, law, and medicine became accepted disciplines, and by the twentieth century the social sciences and business were included. To be a discipline, each field of study had to offer a set of problem solving methods and a reference literature together with theories of the phenomena with which they worked. Engineering adapted theo ries such as thermodynamics and laboratory methods from phys ics. Social sciences adapted data collection and statistical tech niques from the sciences and applied them to social phenomena. Similarly, psychology divorced itself from classical philosophy by applying experimental methods from medical research and sta tistical techniques from other sciences. This discipline-based ap proach to education presented conceptual and proprietary prob lems for the academy. Acceptance of the sciences into the curricu lum put into question what was foundational and what were spe cialist and professional. If natural science was general education, why were the social sciences and law excluded? Why were engi neering and medicine, physical education, and all the rest excluded? Since knowledge appears to be contingent, no inherent infor mation or method of inquiry is justified as general, timeless, or basic. What is common to the candidate notions for general knowl edge is the process of controlled inquiry (e.g., being specific and precise, holding conditions as constant as possible while seeing the consequences of manipulating other conditions, referring to evidence to support assertions, etc.). Moreover, since any par ticular knowledge set can be seen as a political force that prompts its own resistance, only studies that provide for critical inquiry</page><page sequence="5">Fin de Si?cle America 199 have a hope of not obliviously promulgating the power of one group over another. If we embrace a postmodernist perspective, perhaps the best way to foster controlled and critical inquiry among students of general education in fin de si?cle America is to (1) avoid the stan dard course that suggests knowledge comes in standard packages, (2) avoid teaching general education within single disciplines and offer learning experiences with teams of professors across disci plines, and (3) offer a set of various inquiry experiences. These experiences should be relatively extensive and vary in credit in perhaps only a few changing categories (e.g., five to ten classes totaling fifty-some credit units). The experiences would draw from diverse instructional forms but should involve only a small por tion of seat time and quite a bit of collaborative, creative, hands on activities. These experiences would involve temporary "com munities of learners" focusing upon some contemporary problem worked out by an instructional team. Each student would often work collaboratively, but would produce an individual digital port folio along with other forms of assessment. General education might be better thought of as a description of the ways in which we put information and ideas into a "profit able" context. General education could focus upon the disciplines as sets of tools, sometimes overlapping. The "linguistic turn" in the study of knowledge has disclosed that disciplines are evolv ing symbolic forms or manifolds?vocabularies of distinctions and beliefs that are tools for dealing with particular problems and not ways of picturing reality. Of course, these tools demonstrate both problem-solving powers and profound limitations. Several pos sible "extensive experiences," instead of standard classes, might help students function better in our postmodern world. First, "General" experiences more consistent with a postmodern perspective are all consistent with a sense that all knowledge can be treated profitably as a text with endless possible interpreta tions. Hypertext becomes a central feature of pedagogy. Second, the progressive fragmentation of power that undermines the he gemony of the Western intellectual tradition invites an emphasis upon critical synopsis as a central feature of pedagogy. The tacit personal and cultural experiences that students bring to the uni versity are too often ignored or invalidated. Nowadays many pro</page><page sequence="6">200 Parker fessors begin by eliciting, validating, and using these experiences to accelerate learning. In a postmodern approach, these pre-univer sity beliefs can be pitted consciously against various and often con tradictory frameworks; the result is not a shared view so much as a shared power to tolerate differences critically and to see consequences for holding beliefs. Subsequent to surveying these postmodern pedagogical ap proaches of hypertext and critical synopsis, issues of general edu cation subject matter can be better addressed. General Education as Text Deconstruction and Reinterpretation Perhaps the most central feature of a postmodern general educa tion curriculum would be to excite students about the linguistic turn in the twentieth century and how it has changed the Western intellectual tradition. The technology that made the printed text possible is the cen tral feature creating the modern world and its power structures. At first, the printed manuscript empowered primarily priests and monarchs (Landow, 1992, p. 13). The elitist use of writing was expanded with print media, which more easily provided multiple copies, dispersed speech, and allowed authoritarian power to be better bureaucratized. Print-centered language created a print cul ture with editors, bibliographers, scholars, and critics. Print even tually reorganized the social world and made possible a market driven, democratic literary system. The typewriter further democ ratized pagination, bibliography, indexing, and other book and periodical technologies. Recently, the word processor made text more flexible and easier to draft and replicate and this gave the writer greater control of the inspirational process. The computer database vastly simplified the process of accessing print and link ing text blocks nonsequentially. But, as Derrida (1981) noted, "one cannot tamper" with the book "without disturbing everything else." The "linguistic turn" made it clear that language (especially the choice of vocabulary and argument) was a tool, a game, and a political force. Recent technologies that advanced word process ing now make it possible for the undergraduate student to be lib</page><page sequence="7">Fin de Si?cle America 201 erated from the idea of language as merely a representational medium. Word processing at first seems to make footnotes and indexes simpler to create, but this leads to radical consequences, since text blocks relate to indexes and notes electronically and automatically: parallel texts, source information, and commen tary are always virtually on the same page. This is much more than a matter of convenience, since now each text block invites the reader to trace the potential connections intended and unin tended by the writer. This intertextuality is revolutionizing the nature of writing. Hypertext creates a liberated discourse, but at the price of a decentralized complexity. Electronic writing creates a new rela tionship between writers and their text; it also creates a new rela tionship between the reader and the retrieved text. Just as non sequential writing frees the author, it frees the reader to branch at will. Text becomes part of a database that links texts to each other. Just as paragraphs were linked linearly, they can now be linked in any order or with paragraphs in other texts. No writer's authority governs the order and linkages, only the reader. Each passage becomes a node in an infinite series of possible new texts. The text loses its boundaries. Any part can become footnote or cen terpiece. Just as a scholarly article has always existed in the con text of prior articles, all texts now take on this trait. In this way text inevitably becomes hypertext and authorship becomes decentered?text becomes democratized. The narrative and dialogue of oral communication that was variable, nonlinear, and r?visable is recreated in hypertext discourse, which restores the interplay of opinion and shared authorship. The linear book gives way to links, associative indexing, trails of links, and webs of trails (Landow, 1992). The boundary between writer and reader becomes indistinct. Text becomes intertext and related to an en tire universe of information. The historical, logical, cultural, and psychological context of the writer becomes wholly contingent; the journal article and the book, the products of scientific and humanistic scholarship, become less recognizable. Text blocks lose their center and become infinitely decentered and recentered. The author-centered work becomes a text-centered or reader-centered system (Bolter, 1990). Moreover, the authors' categories, distinctions, and chains of logic lose their solidity. The overarching narratives of</page><page sequence="8">202 Parker modernism, what Lyotard calls "grand narratives," become no more central than anything else. The way that knowledge is ex pressed and the way that it is learned keep changing. From a postmodern perspective, the study of discourse and textuality, of how language operates to construct social reality and maintain both institutions and "regimes of knowledge," is the most central feature of higher education. The introductory general edu cation experience would be one that demonstrates the many ways in which language operates to create, maintain, and change the sociocultural world. This intertextuality can be used to reorga nize the multiple ways we use language as an inquirential tool in our communities. When inquiry is interpreted pragmatically as the production of useful novelty or innovation, the logic of problem solving becomes something different than the application of "method" to phenom ena. The "logic" of discovery is, in important ways, not logic at all, but the use of metaphor that is further refined into analogy and models using feedback. We try to understand something un familiar or mysterious in terms of something better understood. This implies that our categories for understanding are not "neces sary presuppositions," as Kant would have it, but metaphorical constructions. A conventional way of languaging about the fa miliar, with all of its associations, can be applied hypothetically to an unfamiliar issue to see the ways it fits and fails to fit. For example, biological phenomena are often described mechani cally (cybernetics, hydraulics, negative entropy, telecommunications, control systems). Mechanical devices and processes are often de scribed biologically using terms such as homeostasis or growth. Mental and social phenomena are described using both types (men tal ontogeny and pylogeny, instinctual "drives" that are "channeled," imprinting, social bonds, attraction, dynamics, etc). Darwinian no tions of adaptation and competition are social metaphors while natu ral selection is a metaphor based upon comparing artificial breed ing with "nature's own." His notion of the "decent of man" is cap tured with the aid of the metaphor of a branching tree. What we call denotation and common sense is better thought of as old stale metaphor that proved so apt over so long that its origin is forgotten. In fact the vocabulary of specialized disci</page><page sequence="9">Fin de Si?cle America 203 plines emerges gradually by progressively modifying common language until it becomes distinctly less like common sense, but a more useful symbolic manifold. The seemingly apt metaphor pro motes a new line of public discourse, observation, and experiment. In the hypertext "adventures," the pragmatic, metaphoric, and frequently qualitative strategies employed in inquiry can be pre sented. Rather than tell about research, the hypertext guides and demonstrates. A foundation of hands-on experience gradually cre ates a fund of experience to use to reflect back more abstractly upon ideas such as method and warrant. General Education as Critical Synopsis Postmodernism suggests that knowledge emerges in the adven ture of the dialectic, in opposing viewpoints, rather than from only one transcendental and hegemonic viewpoint. The appreciation of what it means to claim warrant for beliefs emerges only by sifting, sorting, and weighing viewpoints, by appreciating the evo lution of ideas within and between frames of reference and posi tions of power. Typically, the postmodern term for this activity is called deconstruction?one attempts to take apart or deconstrue research results such as the historical, linguistic, political, logi cal, and so forth. The term critical synopsis may be more intelli gible. Consider the evolution of economic theory in general educa tion. In the 1960s, Paul Samuelson was at the height of his influ ence with his university text Principles of Economics. Classes throughout the country received the impression that finally econo mists had pretty much worked out how economies operate. Di viding the discipline into micro and macro components was the final breakthrough and the coming years of research would em pirically validate the theory.1 The belief that the current economic consensus would be the enduring or true one was not new, however. At the beginning of what we now call "economic theory" during the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, theorists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo searched for an impersonal, suprasocial, or</page><page sequence="10">204 Parker natural order in the dynamics of wealth and scarcity. They thought that they had discovered a science-like lawfulness in the market's constrained drive for capital and in the function of rents, tariffs, and so forth. That their work unquestioningly assumed the aristo cratic class system of English society to be natural was not clearly exposed until Marx articulated the social causes behind the sup posed "natural economic forces" in classical political economy. By the twentieth century, social and economic conditions had changed and so had economic theory. Alfred Marshall articulated the reciprocal dynamics of supply and demand, costs and ben efits, and other constructs related to price formation. The "classi cal economics" of Smith, Ricardo, and J. S. Mill had little support in this much more analytical approach. But Marshall, too, was soon to be displaced as the vessel of economic truth when, subsequent to World War I, conditions had changed again. John Maynard Keynes's theory shifted the focus of analysis from marginal utilities and costs to the wider topics of characterizing national savings, investment, output, and employment. He brought these constructs to the task of understanding market failure and, with the Great Depression, how to create government policies to induce growth. In the case of each of these economic models over the last two centuries, they garnered widespread support at the time and even expressed a consensual outlook lasting several decades. When social and historical conditions changed, however, a new model replaced the old one. During the zenith of influence, each model was considered to be essentially accurate and all encompassing, yet each was replaced. Keynesian theory, of which Paul Samuel son's model was a late expression, lost its hegemony in the 1970s for several reasons. Per capita income had risen substantially for over two decades, making the model created to contend with de pression less topical; moreover, decades of research had failed to link macro and micro analysis into a coherent whole. In the prac tical realm, the Keynesian model proved inadequate to explain inflation or to predict stagflation. By the 1980s, those ideologi cally opposed to government regulation of the economy were in power and Keynesianism was treated with derision. At present, a mix of models (i.e., "New Classical," "Monetarist," "Post Keynesian," "New Institutional," and "rational expectations") all</page><page sequence="11">Fin de Si?cle America 205 compete unsuccessfully for dominance. Using economics as an example, not of a subject matter par ticularly, but of an approach to general education, pedagogy sug gests the postmodern. Rather than conceiving of the course as sharing the current received view and as the interpretation of a canon, students could benefit from examining the conditions under which each model was created, came to dominate, and subsequently declined in influence. Teaching the construction and critical evalu ation of knowledge would not be postponed until and unless the student went on to higher studies. Although one can reasonably argue that the new student may be confused by the complexity of evolving viewpoints, in the long run the opposite may be true. Leaving a topic with the false impression that the received view is and will remain static ill prepares students for a dynamic future. Critical synopsis, the summarizing and comparing of alterna tive viewpoints concerning a topic, is a hallmark of a postmodern general education?viewpoints are considered as texts and these texts in turn refer to others as the topic is elaborated. This inter textuality is made even more central to the postmodern by the in vention and use of a second hallmark, hypertext. Hypertext takes the traditional activity of checking references and cross-references and shifts them to the center of inquiring. The subject matter is not augmented by references; rather, the expanding network of refer ences, viewpoints, and counterviewpoints is the subject matter. Beyond hypertext and critical synopsis, a third hallmark of a gen eral education influenced by postmodernism might be that it is pri marily inquirential. Often modern approaches emphasize the dis coveries and creations of a discipline in entry-level courses and the research or inquiry method may be less apparent. Highlighting the findings of a discipline may mistakenly suggest to the student that the knowledge is not embedded in method, culture, and history. Treating the method as the central feature and the findings as sec ondary both emphasizes the local nature of the knowledge and empowers the student to think of methods as tools for purposes. Using hypertext and critical synopsis, traditional inquirential methods take on new features. The emerging electronic library and Internet free users from some of the slow and arduous aspects of research and place materials at hand as desired. Without these</page><page sequence="12">206 Parker innovations, the postmodern approach to general education prob ably would not be possible. In what follows, methods of social inquiry are examined. This, in turn, leads to a discussion of logi cal analysis and, finally, natural inquiry. Constructing or Characterizing Oneself and Society in a Global, Multicultural World In the previous essay (part 2 of "General Education in Fin de Si?cle America"), the social construction of self was juxtaposed to the modern notion of self-discovery. The modern ideal of sovereign and homogenous nation states with unchanging institutions and roles is coming to be seen as antique. The breakdown of Western individualism in a secular culture in which instant global commu nication and mass media develop superficial mass culture sug gests shifting and even contradictory loyalties. However, this condition demonstrates how subjectivity and the creation of val ues, conscience, and aspirations are created linguistically and con tingently. Difference, identity, and solidarity are coming to be seen as constructed. This may enable self-creation by exposing false universals and ideal homogeneity. Taking one's place in culture requires not only the overcoming of parochial views, but also the cultivation of cosmopolitanism through exploring various belief systems and value systems, the history that made them so, their comparative value. This might serve to clarify the claim that con tingency makes knowledge?including the subjective?different from the Western tradition, but not meaningless. In the middle of the century, George Kelley, a psychologist, proposed a view of human nature far outside mainstream thought.2 His "psychology of personal constructs" suggests that the self is constructed linguistically as a set of bipolar constructs that map nature and one's place in it idiosyncratically. Each individual se lects certain pairs of opposites (e.g., smart or average, shy or out going, ambitious or lazy) to map her own character, opportuni ties, and barriers. This theory seems quite compatible with a postmodern view. The subject becomes a self-written text and the challenges of the future invite one to articulate one's self-world description and modify it based upon feedback. For Kelly, psy</page><page sequence="13">Fin de Si?cle America 207 chotherapy was the opportunity to hypothetically reconstrue alter natives and test them. In this sense general education as self-ex ploration becomes self-redescription in the face of a multicultural, international world where values are not homogenous. Perhaps the language of characterizing human being and cul ture can be treated critically and textually within social inquiry. The terminology of psychology, sociology, anthropology, take on a different significance when seen as social constructions designed to serve both institutional and personal purposes. Although some postmodernists desire to abandon all large-scale theory as "grand narratives," Best and Keller (1991, p. 172) are more cautious and argue that large-scale subjects need not necessarily be "totalizing narratives." They discriminate between "master narratives" like those of Hegel, Marx, or Parsons; "big stories" such as the "rise" of some institution or nation; the metanarratives of philosophy; the "synchronie narratives" or stories about a group at a place and time; and "diachronic narratives," or stories about discontinuity. In making this distinction, they suggest that even big stories do not have to be constructed as, or accepted as, grand narratives. Postmodernism requires only that we not privilege single dis courses and that we expose dogma masquerading as reason. Examining how humanities and social-science methods might appear in a general education influenced by postmodernism sug gests how they produce local knowledge rather than grand narra tives. Three such examples include case study, ethnography, and historical analysis. In the individual case study, a subject is observed and inter viewed, and corroborative evidence for his/her report is gathered from documents and reports of others. One attempts to under stand behavior, opinions, and so forth by looking at past person alized events. The answers constitute the evidence for generaliza tions as to what makes the case typical or exceptional (depending upon the intent of the study). Effective case study situates the subject in historical, economic, political, or cultural context so that the significance of the actions at that time can be interpreted. From a postmodern view, the purposes and values of those doing the study become as important and prominent as the method. The case study does not attempt to create transcendent truths, is rela</page><page sequence="14">208 Parker tively easy to understand, and produces limited "local" knowledge. The anthropology of modern social institutions, or ethnogra phy, uses methods of field investigation and concrete description of a time and place makes it possible to compare groups, organi zations, and subcultures. The challenge is to show the relation ship between individual behavior and group behavior (culture). However, from a postmodern position, the question of the valid ity of ethnographic studies, the degree to which they portray the group "accurately," is misguided. The degree to which the meth ods were explained well enough that the study could be replicated and the extent to which cross-comparisons with other cases, stud ies, researchers are possible remains important, of course. Like wise "triangulation" (e.g., the consonance between responses/ob servations, of informants and artifacts/documents) remains impor tant. However, the intent is to get not a picture of reality, but a version or narrative of the ethnographic phenomenon from one per spective or context to contrast with others. Lessons may be found, but they are not expected to be transcendental, merely provisional. Historical narrative tries to use present traces of the past to describe the past and perhaps conjecture implications for the fu ture. Fragments are collected to describe the past. In addition, structural or model-based historians try to apply theories of why something happened in order to explain it. Historical research attempts to control for reliability and validity of data (reports and artifacts), for anachronism and one-sided interpretations of ob servers or chroniclers. In descriptive narration, the historical in quirer asks what occurred in what sequence with whom, when, where, and how? Additional interpretive narration may focus upon the relationship between antecedents and consequences as plau sible causes. Again, from a postmodern perspective, the lessons learned are not transcendental. The results are interpretations of a particular historian or group for their own purposes. Explicat ing these is part of the task of the postmodern student. For other social methods that have attempted to create more sweeping generalizations, the supposed "objectivity" of empiri cism can simply be deconstructed as part of the effort. Beneath any given inquirential activity, the limited local logic can be ex plicated as the method is taught.</page><page sequence="15">Fin de Si?cle America 209 Deconstructing Logic The postmodern thinker asks, "How do logical analysis and refer ence to existential evidence actually operate within the inquirential community?" "How do the two types of generality (grouping par ticulars into kinds by similarity and grouping event sequences into "causal relations") operate in an inquirential world appreciative of contingency?" In the previous essay, I argued that the professed ways that analysis, criticism, and consensus work are different than the modern paradigm suggested (i.e., that the properly used method ultimately will achieve noncontingent objective knowledge). As a frame of reference, consider the overused analogy of inquiry's parallels with the activity of the justice system: inquiry begins a little like the work of a detective (research investigator) who must match possible means, motives, and opportunities (facts of the inquirential situation) with suspects (subjects, cases, samples, etc.). The detective looks for clues (evidence) to match suspects to the criteria (support/refute hypotheses) until he or she successively eliminates all alternatives except one. Inquiry con cludes a little like a court case that can always be appealed. The court trial (the professional discourse) is a problematic situation in which the significance of what has occurred and who is respon sible are disputed (counter journal articles). The rival attorney (researcher) asserts judgments about the facts of the case and what they imply?then hypothetical alternatives are proposed by each. Each produces evidence for their judgments (records, witnesses, protocols, etc.) that may be disputed by the rival attorney. Rules of law (accepted methods) are introduced to determine the rel evance of the evidence. Prior cases (other studies) are cited as precedents. The judge (the professional elders) brings all of this together to produce a final judgment (received wisdom). In the previous essay, I noted that twentieth-century philoso phy has illustrated that grammatical form is ambiguous with re spect to logical structure. The ideas of qualities and kinds are complex notions that are seriously conflated in classical Greek philosophy. For Aristotle, qualities are either necessary or con tingent properties of things observed in nature and language is</page><page sequence="16">210 Parker capable of unequivocally depicting them. His theory of defini tion assumes that inquiry leads to the identification of kinds. Characteristic traits signify kinds through inference (Hickman, 1992, p. 102). Through the power of careful description, tangible objects become implicative of possible kinds of objects. Identifi cation of these natural essences places particular objects in nature's classifying scheme and exhausts the possibilities of inquiry. When inquiry is considered as the production of novel solu tions through the act of transforming or redescribing situations, objectivization?the name for this transforming process?takes on new meaning. The "problem of universals," or how similari ties between objects or their qualities makes it possible to general ize kinds by grouping particulars, is as old as Plato. Plato posited forms as the dynamic behind grouping. The essences were real and existed in a realm independent of the everyday welter of expe rience. Aristotle considered them to be self-subsisting attributes of particular objects, which effectively pointed to their way of grouping or their "kind." Nominalists, upon finding no evidence for such "essential" qualities, considered them as merely linguis tic conventions?similarities were not real, but merely convenient names. Conceptualists argued, alternatively, that certain natural properties of particular objects could be used for grouping. The conceptions that arise are ideational rather than existential. Dewey proposed that generality is not a property, but an activ ity of inquiry in the ways that inference is enacted. It deals with a product of inquiry and not with existential things prior to inquiry. Generality is a habit or disposition to deal with things in certain ways for certain purposes. A proposition is a proposal and group ing into kinds is proposed. As a proposal, it can be tested. The proposal is a statement of expectation. An expectation is a habit that institutes a readiness to act or operate in a particular way. This expectation is verified not by natural kinds, but by logical kinds. Kinds are an activity proposed not by nature, but by in quirers. Qualities are characteristics of a kind when they are consequences of operations that are modes or ways of changing and acting. This fact indicates that it is the operations that are themselves general and not kinds (Dewey, 1935, p. 254; Hickman, 1992, pp. 130-31). The attempts to objectify affairs through systematic specula tion, through contemplating logical coherence, through instrumen</page><page sequence="17">Fin de Si?cle America 211 tation, quantification, and experimentation, are necessarily limited. The contingencies of inquiry are natural, biological, linguistic, his torical, ethical, and both purposive and culturally interpretive. No appeal to logic or nature's evidence can escape these contingen cies. Postmodern criticism offers not a substitute for logical foun dations, but only a forthright appreciation of our limitations. What constitutes general education is not so much generally useful methods or facts, but the activity of making comparative interpretations. This activity makes progressively broader and logically coherent (though provisional) generalities. From the postmodern view, when general education is presented as a smor gasbord of classes, the interdisciplinary character of inquiry and the interrelation of content are obscured. Distribution require ments have the advantage of helping students see the same inquirential activity applying in art history, physics, and psychol ogy, but only if the "chunks" are large. When the requirements move from a half dozen complex topics to eighteen or twenty three unit courses, the theme of inquiry and generalizing is lost. Experience with Characterizing Natural Phenomena In the previous essay, I noted that the classical Greek philoso phers, especially Aristotle, assumed that grammar and logic were both unequivocally and ideally suited to each other and as a result major confusions as to the nature of categorical thought and logic were ignored or unnoticed. Science tried to overcome these se vere difficulties with the logic of inquiry by instituting experi mental and mathematical aids. Nevertheless, subsequent philo sophical analysis (even by philosophers awed by scientific suc cesses) demonstrated that science was not grounded either logi cally or empirically. The postmodern view of inquiry and verifi cation, while loosing pretensions to methods for discovering eter nal truths, uncovers many false assumptions of past inquiry, and it places inquiry firmly in the practical activities of the commu nity and not in a theory of knowledge. Deduction was thought to be the taking of an assured general belief (or major premise) and a particular statement about the con ditions at hand (the minor premise) and then arriving at a new conclusion about the current situation that was not obvious until</page><page sequence="18">212 Parker the major premise was linked to it. The proofs of geometry and mathematics were considered the model of deductive reason, and deduction was held to be the algorithm for reaching truth.3 Faith, tradition, folklore, and such could still be the source of premises, however; and these premises could be mistaken. In deductive logic itself, there was no recipe for guaranteeing sure premises. In fact, many of the notions arrived at by early philosophers turned out to be wrong because the premises, not the logic, was wrong. Science evolved over the last four centuries with the apprecia tion that further methods to assure the certainty of premises were needed to control logic itself. Logic alone was incapable of con trolling inquiry. Nothing in logic prevents one from grouping phenomena into seemingly arbitrary and fanciful classes. Noth ing in logic prevents one from using premises that turn out to be false. Empirical science emerged from the recognition that only immediate personal experience, the first-hand study of the facts of the matter in question, could supply the distinctions of kinds (or categories) and assured premises based upon nature and not upon speculation. Improvement in objectivization was furthered next by the aid of three technologies: (1) instruments or tools for progressively refined observation and measurement, (2) calcula tion, and (3) experiment. The new conceptions made possible by explorers such as Henry the Navigator, Columbus, Megellan, and others showed new vistas for thought through first-hand discovery. The invention of the tele scope and microscope showed other no-less-important domains to understand. Sticking to descriptions of observations produces bet ter premises. Through methodically recording observations using careful drawings and tables listing what was observed, the facts of the matter would be available for logical analysis. Reasoning would be from representative cases rather than simply from known cases. Not only natural objects, but also events could be studied in this way. Examining and recording sequences of events could help one to identify unsuspected patterns of occurrence?orderly changes such as natural cycles, ultimately even causal laws. Forces could even be manipulated to see what happens to one thing when an other is intentionally changed; thus, as Francis Bacon noted, the scientist could question nature. In this way, knowledge has a new ally: to the method of logical refutation is added empirical refuta</page><page sequence="19">Fin de Si?cle America 213 tion. Statements may be shown to be predictively false as well as logically false. In this way, empirical verification shifts from sim ply finding supporting cases to predicting their occurrence. Galileo implemented this new method by relying upon three cornerstones of modern science: (1) the search for order in change itself, (2) the conceiving of nature mathematically, and (3) the experimental manipulation of phenomena to understand the rela tion of antecedent conditions to consequences. Instead of look ing for truth in the immutable and enduring (as the ancient Greeks had typically done), Galileo conceived change itself as the source of knowledge. He searched for order in change, and gradually natural phenomena were conceived of as relations between con stants and variables. By controlling observation through carefully measuring the motions of objects rolling down incline planes and swinging as pendulums, for example, Galileo developed formulas integrating time and distance traveled into statements about velocity and ac celeration. He overturned Aristotle's "fact" that objects have a tendency to come to rest and substituted the principle of inertia. Likewise, he showed that objects do not fall at a speed propor tional to their weight, but at a constant velocity. By mathematizing description in a way reminiscent of Pathagoras, he provided a way to control observation as the measurement of constants and vari ables and explanation as the specification of mathematical rela tionships. Nature must be mathematized to understand it. Through the research journals in England and then across the continent, a new type of public discourse emerged?the scientific debate. Over the coming centuries, the following questions cap tured the interest of the scientific community: How do you construe phenomena as sets of constants and variables? How do you con strue particular events as representative of natural phenomena? How do you construe events as variable associations? How do you con strue events as the results of the effect of independent variables upon dependent variables? How do you exclude other interpretations? By conducting a series of observations in which natural condi tions are intentionally manipulated, features that otherwise would not be noted are exposed. The subject matter of inquiry is no longer the sensuous objects found in nature, but data. The given and the natural cease to be ends to understand through logical definition,</page><page sequence="20">214 Parker arrangement, categorization. They become transformed into data that indicate: clues or signs of something else?qualities become dependable signs (Dewey, 1960, pp. 98-99). Objectification shifts from determining the essential nature of an object (by sifting through the welter of sensuous properties for something endur ing) and becomes the specification of data that in turn imply pos sible relations of constants and variables. Scientific inquiry adds the power of quantification to inference. Objects conceived quantitatively are capable of systematic sub stitutions, controls, and transformations?the institution of equiva lencies. As instrumentation and measurement are attended to, observation may lead to manipulation. Through measurement, properties become more dependable signs. The objects of sci ence are more than the logical signs, clues, and evidence they were for Aristotle; they become data that can be related dynamically. Passively observed traits give way to logical traits to a much greater extent. Enduring objects or kinds are seen as constructions, not given to immediate experience, but instituted and maintained through recurring operations that treat data as signs of the pres ence of something less apparent. Tangible objects and data are treated as implicative and thus control inference. A good theory of phenomena, then, becomes merely the ex haustive analysis of it. Theoretical statements, then, are simply conditional proposals of the form: if... then. Like the proposal of kinds, causal notions are a form of constructed or proposed gen erality (Dewey, 1935, p. 102). Cause and effect are not related by laws that inquiry discovers through argument or scientific experi ment?they do not describe what is necessarily so, but simply what is so (Hickman, 1992, p. 120). Hypothetical propositions transform phenomenal statements of fact into generalizations: "jt exists under conditions a, b, c" is transformed into "if a, by c conditions occur/exist, then jt," or "if , then a, b, c." They become statements of relations that might possibly exist in particular cases and as such may be fanciful as in "objects in motion seek to come to rest" or more accurate as in "a moving body not resisted or obstructed will continue indefinitely at the same velocity in the same direction." Hypothetical propo sitions make systematic doubt and experiment possible. Experimental activities are suggested by the hypotheses and the supposed facts of the matter. If a hypothetical solution is right,</page><page sequence="21">Fin de Si?cle America 215 then that solution should solve the problem or, less directly, if the solution is right, then certain facts could be anticipated. If the hypothesis is right, then, if we try the solution, we should observe these factual outcomes. If the hypothesis is wrong, then, if we try the solution, we should not observe these factual outcomes. A postmodern approach to the study of science might empha size the constructive nature of logic, the twists and turns needed to arrive at coherence and the way that final reports redescribe their logic as deductive or hypothetico-deductive. A postmodern approach might also emphasize the historical, normative, and pur posive context behind a research agenda. As discussed above, hypertext and critical synopsis make pos sible a reinterpretation of several common elements of general education. Three of these, self and cultural construction, con structing logic, and characterizing natural phenomena, were dis cussed above. In what follows, other potential themes are men tioned. It should be noted, however, that an essential perspective is that each approach and topic be inquirential. As James Ratcliff notes, "The current prevailing practice of packaged bodies of knowledge developed and taught by individual instructors does not lead students to learn that the precisely defined methods, modes of inquiry, models, and theories presented in the curriculum are in practice fraught with discord, debate, and disagreement. The gen eral education many students encounter may produce a false sense of hegemony or harmony" (Gaff and Ratcliff, 1997, p. 147). This and the prior two essays argue that this practice is not only mis leading, but ill adapts students to the world on the horizon. Data Collection and Characterization Many diverse disciplines, including all of the social sciences, busi ness, communications, marketing, and so forth, rely upon the abil ity to acquire and interpret data from multiple subjects, including qualitative (nominal), ordinal, and parametric. Distinctions of kinds can sometimes be ordinated and provide increased evalua tive utility. More rarely, some may be considered parametrically and gain still greater precision and be open to substantial inferen tial uses in hypothesis testing. Citizens as consumers of these data, need to be able to evaluate critically their meaning and util</page><page sequence="22">216 Parker ity. In addition, they need to be able to understand that data are never pure and objective, but always perspectival and embedded in the power and value struggles of the community. Two statistical methods employed by researchers in the last one hundred years exemplify both the strengths and the limitations of quantification in the social sciences. The general approach has been to assume that the causes for social phenomena are so com plex and involve so many variables that anything like a lawful formula for individual or group behavior of the "if...then..." type is out of the question. An inexact form of lawfulness might be discovered, not for the particular case, but for "typical" cases. Probability theory examines orderly sequences at this molar level. Since the probability of the likelihood of an event can be thought of as favorable outcomes divided by the number of equally pos sible outcomes, the probability can be calculated by sampling the frequency of occurrences (Kerlinger, 1964). This knowledge of probability can then be used inquirentially. The two primary meth ods of relating variables into laws of probability are measures of association, such as correlation, and measures of group differences, such as analysis of variance. In association research, one attempts to find variables that co vary in systematic ways, such as human height and weight or edu cation and income. Although these vary together only to some extent, they make it possible to predict partially one covariate from knowledge of the other (with some degree of confidence) for cases similar to those already known. If the degree of correlation be tween two variables (for a large set of observations) is extremely unlikely if the variables are related by chance, then the hypoth esis of a chance relationship can be rejected. Analysis of variance allows one to design and interpret experi ments by comparing the differences between control and treatment groups in "before" and "after" circumstances. The likelihood that the differences found are probable under chance or random cir cumstances gives researchers a frame of reference for interpreting the effect of their treatments. If the differences produced by the treatment are extremely unlikely by chance, then the hypothesis that the treatment effect was do to chance can be rejected. A general education experience in data collection, measurement, and analysis is not the same as a traditional statistics course. The</page><page sequence="23">Fin de Si?cle America 217 intent is to create critical collectors and consumers of informa tion. For example, the collection of demographic data is always based upon political or economic purposes. Measures of ability presuppose theories of intelligence that evolved for specific pur poses. Opinion data is indirectly shaped by the structure of the questions and the means of obtaining the data, and these, in turn, are determined by the purposes of the researchers. The ability to evaluate conclusions critically has as much to do with purposes, ideologies, and the history of ideas as it does with technical is sues of survey and data analysis. Construing Technology A world relying more and more upon digital technologies to sus tain itself makes two demands upon the educated. A phrase like "computer literacy" does not capture the need, however. It is not using and understanding current technology that will be so impor tant, but an attitude of not being intimidated by technology, of be ing intrigued by technical developments and what they do, and a connoisseurship of social effects and the challenges they pose. Comfort with mastering new technologies and a critical concern for their impact may be crucial for living in a world of accelerating change. Understanding the ways that software can mimic cogni tive strategies can make technology less esoteric and show us the differences between the artificial, the biological, and the cognitive. General education themes about how various technologies work could teach mathematics, science, and engineering "basics" while improving the student's ability to adapt successfully to innova tion. Exploring topics such as "What is computable?" or "Could a computer be manufactured that could think, calculate, believe, perceive?" or "Is the brain a computer?" could help students learn, not only about the subjects just mentioned, but also about biol ogy, organic chemistry, philosophy, psychology, and so forth. New digital technologies make vast amounts of information more easily accessible from virtually anywhere. At the same time, these technologies eliminate old ways and old institutions; they change the value we place on commuting, shopping, or going to school. Just as agrarianism dramatically changed life for nomads</page><page sequence="24">218 Parker who became farmers, and industrialism changed the life of farm ers, a global cosmopolitanism will change life for us. It seems that general education needs to offer an "anthropology of the new" if we are to have the tools to understand who and where we are. Experience with Innovation, Invention, and Entrepreneurship The act of creation, whether in the arts and humanities, business, engineering, community affairs, or the sciences, is a central fea ture of the world. If the dynamics of creativity remain a mystery, then a rigid and Stereotypie view of knowledge is the result. Al ready, our citizens are being challenged to insert themselves into a world where innovation changes the landscape in remarkable ways every year. Case studies of the context and activities of innova tors could be used to introduce the subject, and then teams of stu dents could be invited to create solutions for problems of the cam pus and the wider community. Not only would this prepare stu dents to be sensitive to change and familiar with its processes, but it might open opportunities for them to be more comfortable with change and perhaps to construe themselves as innovators. Currently most campuses avoid considering business a general subject even though it constitutes the work life of most Americans. From the perspective of the postmodern, however, the activities of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship are not simply areas of professional knowledge, but basic adaptive skills. To the extent that this new world is discontinuous with modernity, it is in large part because of the workings of technology and business. Promulgating an Argument/Debating/Negotiating Dialogical persuasion remains a central feature of many knowl edge activities across professions and disciplines from science, to human services, to advertising, to collective bargaining, and to attempting to act as a leader. The tradition of debating teams to select a broad common topic and debate it may have a broader general education use. What has been considered a basic speech</page><page sequence="25">Fin de Si?cle America 219 or rhetoric experience takes on a new meaning in a postmodern curriculum. Since postmodernism argues that logical and "ob jective" inquiry can never be separated from normative issues, it returns us in a sense to a pre-Socratic world where all subjects are rhetorical. Our hope, postmodernism argues, is not in transcend ing rhetoric, but in making one's arguments more sophisticated, coherent, and inclusive, whether the topic is quantum mechanics, the phenomenology of knowledge, rhythm, attitude development, medical ethics, or gourmet cooking. In an approach that has a long pedigree?at least back to Gorgias?our speech and philosophy departments could present ethics and morality in a powerful new way. In essay 2, I dis cussed how deference to tradition, to custom, to long-term plea sure (happiness), to duty or social obligation, or to public utility were contingent decisions and not based upon any transcendental foundations. Their power has been in the context of the appeal to authority?in how well they were judged to work by the individual in the community. Just as the long-term success of science has been based upon the use of the feedback of observation and ex periment, rather than upon appeal to a particular paradigm, so, too, with ethics. Appeals to the ethical authority of social obliga tion, public utility, or to private ambitions may gain in authority only as they are analyzed in debate. Where philosophy can iden tify prior justifications that might apply to a particular conduct, public debate can search for corrupt reasoning and can place the conduct in its contemporary context. The students of general edu cation in a postmodern world need to know more than how to survey ethical authorities; they must practice the discourse that will lead them away from parochial and cosmopolitan censure. In this way, they can develop skills to adapt to changing social circumstance and to defend themselves should they find reason to go against the public grain. A general education segment that promotes skills of deconstructing and reconstructing ethical and moral rationales could be very powerful. The same cross-disciplinary approach could be used to under stand and resist the ways that market forces guide our conduct. The Hidden Persuaders (Packard, 1962) was perhaps the first work to analyze extensively the way advertising could have great con trol over consumer behavior. Since then, the problem of the</page><page sequence="26">220 Parker commoditization of aspirations has become one of the central fea tures of postmodern discourse. Only the well-sensitized and trained citizen can identify, resist, and cope with the onslaught of marketing hype that channels conduct in superficial and destruc tive ways. Just as with ethics, the discourse deconstructing mass marketing can provide the tools to help students achieve a higher level of autonomy. A general education segment that fosters skills in deconstructing and reconstructing ethical and moral rationales could be very helpful. An Experience of Collaborative Planning for Excellence Working together to determine goals, develop means for their achievement, identify constraints, and reciprocally adjust means and ends to achieve workable results teach cooperative group liv ing and allow for the integration of knowledge otherwise held in fragmented form. Overcoming the frequent criticism that general education classes often end without integration or synthesis of material might be possible through several ways, including capstone or assessment courses. An advantage to a collaborative experience is that it offers students a chance to develop skills for acting effectively in the highly interdependent context of the com ing years. Collaborative experiences can be provided within other elements of the general education curriculum, such as laborato ries, library research, and so forth. By occasionally focusing the students' attention upon the "social" aspects of knowledge con struction, the values of cooperation, tolerance, and organization of efforts can be learned. A collaborative experience planning for excellence could easily be integrated, with the examination of ethics and with the prob lems of the conformity and commoditization wrought by mass mar keting. A general education segment on the postmodern condition could weave several of the above themes into studies that would seem relevant to students while providing them with significant higher-order coping skills of critical thinking and cooperation. Of course, not every aspect of a liberal education would neces sarily be influenced to a great degree by postmodernism. Several other cross-disciplinary experiences remain likely candidates for such a cross-disciplinary approach, including the following:</page><page sequence="27">Fin de Si?cle America 221 A teaching/public performance experience enhances the power of learning in preparing, demonstrating, and expressing a topic. That which was tacitly held as well understood becomes prob lematic when one attempts to "do it" or "teach it." A greater ap preciation and readiness for dealing with complexity comes about when one develops habits of rehearsal and performance. Our teacher training programs are an untapped resource for the most part and could add much to general education. Moreover, the dis covery of every new professor, that preparing a course greatly broadens and deepens one's own understanding, is a discovery that should not be kept secret from undergraduates. A public service experience is common for upper division stu dents in some majors. However, the ability to appreciate the chal lenges of citizenship and the complexities of culture can be ac quired through discovery of the workings of our institutions. A more profound sense of belonging can be achieved through community involvement. The counterintuitive way in which meaning is cre ated through commitment can become apparent. Finally, learnings that seem abstract in text and dialogue become more real in ac tion?they allow for feedback in ways that help students to modify their means of achieving goals when their plans go awry. They suggest modifying goals when these come to be seen as na?ve. An art, dance, music, or theater appreciation course cannot be left off of the list, but since probably all general education programs have such an offering already, it need not be discussed here. Of course, it could to some degree be integrated into above elements. It should be obvious that the experiences described above care fully avoid grouping by discipline or traditional general educa tion categories and could be achieved by teams of faculty across disciplines. Each team would avail itself of technology, demon strations/expositions, and out-of-class activities. The courses need not consist of just so many hours of "seat time," but many alter natives for the use of time should be considered. Summary The term postmodern, almost unknown outside academia, is a term that has easily polarized opinion. It added a further distinction to the earlier distinction between classical and modern. Modern has</page><page sequence="28">222 Parker often been used to mean the renaissance's break with antiquity. In our century, it has been used to mean the repudiation of the traditional or classical in architecture, literature, and technology. Arnold Toynbee and C. W. Mills among others popularized the term postmodern in the 1950s to mean an iconoclastic reaction against the modern, and it has subsequently been used in litera ture and architecture the same way. The argument boils down to whether one thinks that current Western society is breaking with the recent past or merely evolving. The present series of articles sides with those who believe that a sea change is in its earliest stages. To many, it may appear that technology and unprecedented wealth suggest a new height for modernism or its end. The previ ous two essays, however, are based upon the historical maxim that social genres, like artistic ones, appear to reach their fullest expression just before they disappear. The first of these essays argues that the "big picture" narratives of the social sciences and philosophy are suggestive rather than convincing?the accelerating changes of postindustrialism, con vergence of technologies as digital, and avant-garde art and lit erature may be only evolutionary. Yet certain changes seem so discontinuous that they are hard to dispel and give credence to the idea of a break with our social traditions: the pervasive nature of mass media and unprecedented personal wealth (and the promise of overcoming poverty) to name two such discontinuities with the past. William Mulholland, who engineered the water system for Los Angeles, suggested that "we are doomed to success." In the context of the postmodern, this has a chilling and challenging meaning unintended by its author, who, as a child of modernity, assumed that the application of technology to nature would pro duce a progress that would be only positive and would leave tra ditional values intact. To the extent that a general education program acts mainly to pass on received wisdom, it fails to prepare students to adapt to the very different world that lies ahead. This is problematic, not only because some of what is taught is irrelevant (a problem in all times of change), but also because the intellectual skills of criti cal thinking, adapting to novelty, being self-reliant, and being able to nurture community solidarity need to be emphasized and fos tered. The modern curriculum, consisting of lectures, demonstra</page><page sequence="29">Fin de Si?cle America 223 tions, readings, and tests is inadequate to promote these adaptive skills. To the extent that we ignore these forces of change and merely pass on the humanistic and scientific traditions, we risk unintentionally teaching that general education is irrelevant to the problems of contemporary life and producing the cynicism and absolute relativity of values we abhor. This cynicism, not only will affect the students, but also will progressively undermine the already weakened social mandate for a liberal higher education. The second essay in this series suggests that when we turn from social speculation to the examination of knowledge, radical changes?at least as great at those that occurred with the rise of science and humanism?have been occurring throughout the twen tieth century. Following the spirit of discovery that arose in the renaissance, the modern search for objective certainty turned to empiricism as its method. The enlightenment hoped to avoid using systematic speculation and faith to justify knowledge, but subse quent attempts to insure that science could accurately describe re ality proved discouraging and finally hopeless. Attempts to relate mind, perception, and reality unequivocally focused upon the search for noncontingent aspects of logical coherence, measurement in strumentation, quantification, and experimentation. Ironically, the opposite was discovered in every case. Inquiry is limited by our biological nature, and upon the contingency of our language, his tory, and the values of the inquirer. Inquiry is purposive, cultur ally interpretive, and it indirectly implies a political position. Thus the idea of objective inquiry, inquiry transcending the viewpoint of an individual, a culture, its institutions, and a particular lan guage, is unfounded. A constructive element always seems to be central to inquiry, and this is antithetical to the project of the West ern intellectual tradition upon which the modern is founded. "Epistemologically," it appears that our society is entering "a new cycle" in which the guideposts of the past have limited value. Accelerating change is becoming relentless, and no end is in sight. As mentioned above, the autonomy made possible for our stu dents by interpreting the various canons of the Western intellec tual tradition was effective for centuries. However, it has now produced a citizenry and a society that is becoming progressively discontinuous with its own traditions. The self-governance needed to succeed in a multicultural, international world, a world of greater</page><page sequence="30">224 Parker disarray, a world not simply "postindustrial," or "postcapitalist," but perhaps "post-Western " may be very different. Likewise, the autonomy needed to thrive in a world of accelerating technological change may be quite different: opportunities may appear and disap pear within days, not years, and persistently changing job demands may make the words career and profession terms of nostalgia.
