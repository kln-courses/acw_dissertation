<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEADLESS CONTOUR IN THE ART TRADITION OF ORISSA, EASTERN INDIA BABA MISHRA and PRADEEP MOHANTY Art tradition of Orissa is rich and varied. Richness of Orissan art has been dealt with by a host of scholars and connoisseurs. But the varied aspects of the art heritage of Orissa still remains obscure in view of the fact that systematic survey and documentation of the art objects of Orissa are lacking. The vast stretch of the upland zones of Orissa, studded with artefacts, remain unexplored. This lacu- ana in the art history of Orissa also baffles scholars who want to provide an all-inclusive chronological order to Orissan art. Our three seasons (1997-99 and 1999- 2000) of archaeological exploration in and around Kalahandi district of modern Orissa have yielded remarkable antiquities in the pa-Indian context (Mishra and Mohanty 1999-2000). In the course of this present survey work, a separate set of art objects- headless icons (Male), came to our notice at Junagarh (Old Fort) of Kalahandi district. Before this discovery, two Lajja-Gauri plaques were reported from the adjoining Nupada district (Mohanty and Singh Deo 2000). The present paper therefore aims to study the headless contour of the art tradition of Orissa on the basis of these findings. For the convenience of the study, the art-objects can be grouped into two categories on the basis of their possible chronological position in his- torical outline. Thus, Category-I comprises two stone plaques of headless motif, whereas Cat- egory-II consists of two headless stone images. Category-I (Plaques I and II) During the period 1993 and 1996 two stone plaques were recovered in Nuapada district of Orissa. Plaque No.I was found while excavating the plinth area of Komna Pänchayat College building in 1996. Plaque No.II was discovered by Mr. J.P. Singh Deo in the Kotipadar village, which is about 10 km. from Khariar sub-division of Nuapada in 1993. While the former plaque is in posses- sion of Komna Panchayat College authority, the latter is preserved in the personal collec- tion of Mr.Singh Deo, in Khariar. Iconography: Plaque No.I (Fig.l) A headless goddess is carved on a stone plaque measuring 10 cm x 11 cm. On sty- listic grounds, it can be assigned to the 8th century A.D. The image, however, is consid- erably damaged. The figurine is nude and headless. It is carved in squatting position with outstreched legs, the common posture of female during child birth (Bolon 1992). While fashioning the motif, attempt is made to show anatomical details like bulbous breasts, navel, vulva etc, which are indicative of its bloom- ing youth and also an indication of the fer- tility aspect. Legs are shaped in outstretched posture as far as possible to expose the vulva region. Even the right foot is placed on a raised platform to meet this objective. There is a design, which seems to be a wrinkling</page><page sequence="2">312 Bulletin of the Deccan College 62-63 (2002-2003) of skin or fold of garment on either thigh of the figurine. While the navel is faintly visible the abdomen of the deity is partly chopped off. Below the navel the folding of skin is dis- cerned which betokens a sense of woman- hood. The vulva is carefully carved. Proba- bly the artist had shown the clitoris, which is however, unclear at present. The motif as cited already is modelled in a squatting posi- tion within a shallow tub-like pedestal. But sufficient care was taken to exhibit its genitals prominently. The figurine is two-armed, both broken. The most striking aspect of the motif is that it is headless. Instead of the head, lotus leaves along with its elongated stem are delin- eated on the neck as if it is flowering from it. Some other lotus leaves along with its stems are also discerned on the right side of the shoulder, as if they are emerging from the neck and bending to the right. Thus the upper part of the motif adorned with vegetation unfolds vegetative and fecundity aspects of its nature (Mishra 2000). Fig. 1 Plaque No.II (Fig. 2) This plaque measures 11 cm x 12 cm. The motif is also carved in squatting posi- tion on a Mat, which served the purpose of platform. Unlike the former example, it is characterised by a round and polished body. Plaque No.II of a headless figurine, thus, may be ascribed to the later part of 8th or 9th century A.D. The motif, more- over, wears a cloth (typical of Jama) which covers the lower part of the body up to the ankle and loiters on the Mat. The fold of garment is marked also on either thigh. The feet are of normal flat shape with the toes. The navel is prominently shown with wrin- kles of skin on either side just below and the breasts are carefully fashioned to provide an aesthetic sense to the figurine. The full bosom and heavy hips of the motif, indi- cate its fertility feature. Unlike Plaque No.I, headless goddess, the vulva of Plaque No.II deity, is covered by garment (Jama). The motif, moreover, is two-armed, which is shaped in upright posture. In her right hand, she holds a lotus-bud having a long stem, while the object upheld in left hand is muti- lated. Annulate design indicating armlet is carved on both arm and elbo of the god- dess. There are also punch-marks around her neck, which represent the necklace. The motif is deviod of head. As a substitute for the head, a full-blown lotus is exhibited on the shoulder, blooming from the neck. Fluted petals of the lotus are meticulously carved and it also indicates the vegetative and fertility aspect of the goddess. These two figurines of headless goddess of Nuapada, Orissa, however, demonstrate the artist's mastery of form and conception. The posture of the motifs appears natural. Their body movement is vivacious and elastic. The composition is coherent and it produces a feel- ing of indivisible wholeness of unity, where the</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 Headless Contour in the Art Tradition of Orissa, Eastern India 313 artist, art form and art object remain within an inseparable bond (Mishra 2000). Category-II (Icon No.I and II) Findspot Recently, during our archaeological explo- ration of Kalahandi region, Orissa, we came across two headless statues, modelled in gran- ite stone near Junagarh Block office of Kala- handi District. The site is significant from archaeological context, as it represents the dilapidated temple of 10th century A.D. In the heap of debris of brick and stone slabs, some other cultish icons are also found in situ along with the following two Headless icons. Iconography : Icon No.I (Fig. 3) The two-armed icon measures 36x30 cm. The male image holds its own chopped off head by a tuft of hair in the left hand. The object in the right hand is indistinct, but it seems to be dagger. The figure, which appears to be nude, has sturdy body and muscular limbs. Ornaments if there were any, on the body of the sculpture are considerá- bale abraded. The figure has a slender waist and broad chest, befitting the physical fea- tures of warrior. A dog is carved on the left ridge of the semi-circular pedestal. The over- all shape of the figure is round and the surface is polished. The icon is fashioned in "Sama- vanga" posture on a slab of granite. The strik- ing aspect of the figure is that it is headless. The modelling of the figure was abruptly com- pleted, when the fashioning of chest and limbs were finished. The upper part of the shoulder is not only devoid of throat and head, but at the same time, it looks polished, which was deliberate (Mishra and Mohanty 2001). Fig. 3 Icon No.II (Fig.V) The figure measures 30 x 20 cm. It also has two arms and is fashioned in "Samab- hanga' posture on a slab of granite, but the arms are obliterated. This icon is consider- ably damaged than its counterpart icon No.I. It is also nude, severed head carried in the left hand is missing. Also the dog, carved on</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4 314 Bulletin of the Deccan College 62-63 (2002-2003) the pedestal, is worn out. A separate rectan- gular pedestal is designed on a slab of granite to position the image in "Samabhanga Pos- ture' (Mishra and Mohanty 2001) Icon No.II is also headless. The modelling abruptly stops with the completion of chest and limbs. As usual, the shoulder remains fin- ished and polished. Antiquities and Identity of the Headless Motifs It has been rightly pointed out that head- less deities do not occupy an exalted position in the pantheon of Hindu deities (Dhavalikar 1979-80: 40, 30). There is also no standard iconographie text on the subject matter. Con- sequently confusion arises in the sphere of satisfactory identification of these gods and goddesses. Also, no all-inclusive explantation has yet been made pertaining to the origin and development of headless contour of the deities in the art tradition of India. The most bewildering issue now is that while the riddle of headless figurines (goddess) has not yet been solved, the discovery of headless icons (gods) further makes the whole issue more complicated. In the latter case, however, no paralle has yet been found in India. There are also no such iconographie elements to construe these sculptures as a head offering- motif (Ghosal 1994: 337, 338). Category - I In the hoary antiquity of Indian art tra- dition, however, it is goddess, both in ico- nography and iconology parameters, which first appeared and enamoured the inquisitive mind. The goddess has been labelled as fer- tility figurine, which was also widely popular throughout the ancient world. This reveals the veneration of maternity as a divine prin- ciple. Usually such fertility goddesses were fashioned as headless. The primary empha- sis was given in fashioning the breasts, navel and the vulva regions (James 1960: 47). Indigenous Chalcolithic origin of such motif was suggested by Sankalia after the Inamgaon excavation (Sankalia 1968: 123). Dhere, however, went a^step further in eluci- dating the folk tradition and textual evidences to point out the origin and development of so-called Lajja-Gauri or Headless Goddess (Dhere 1978: 228). As there is no standarised iconographie text on the subject, confusion arises in the satisfactory identification of the goddess. Hitherto, Indologists have identified the said image as "Aditi Uttanapada" (Kramrisch 1959: 259-270) and "Lajja Gauri" or Shameless Women (Sankalia 1968: 123). The denomi- nation "Lajja-Gauri" ascribed to the Headlss deity has been accepted by a host of Indian and foreign scholars. Still identification from other angles has been postulated. In view of the exhibition of vulva region, she has been categorized as "personified Yoni" type of fer- tility figurine (Desai, 1975, 19). The spouting of vegetation from the throat impelis schol- ars to identify her as "Sakambari' (Banerjee 1956: 489: Mukhapadhyay 1972: 74, 94;</page><page sequence="5">Headless Contour in the Art Tradition of Orissa, Eastern India 315 Dhavalikar 1996: 116-117). Marshall, how- ever has identified the lotus-head motif as "Prithvi' (Marshall 1915:12). While others saw an affinity with the nude folk goddess "Kotavi" (C.S. Gupta 1987:49). Hunter, further coined the nomenclature "Nagnakavandha" for the headless goddess (Deo 1972:2). To Bolon, Lajja-Gauri was the next evolution of Gram- adevi (Bolon 68:1992). The headless goddess, therefore, remains a riddle (Mishra 2000). The two stone plaques of headless goddess discovered from Nua- pada district of Orissa (Eastern India), differ from each other in their physical features. The common characteristics of these deities are the headless, outstretched leg posture (squatting position) and vegetative fertility or nourishment aspect. It thus unfolds some clue pertaining to the origin and development of the headless female deity and also the male deity and their respective identities. Headlessness of divinity, especially the mother goddess, in Indian context is dis- cerned since the protohistoric period as the fertility figurines recovered from Mohenjo- daro (Marshall 1931: 52) and Inamgaon (Dhavalikar 1979: 259) show. Later on, in Brahmanical tradition also headless contour of divinity was well fathomed. In this sphere, the story of Renuka (Wife of Sage-Jama- dagni) is an illustration. The icon of Renuka has been worshipped as "Matangi Devi" and "Yallamma" and "Prthvi" for procuring off- spring by barren women today. Another glar- ing example in this sphere is Devi Chinna- masta (split-head) of Dasamahavidya. As enumerated in the chandi saptasati section of Markandeya Purana, Devi Parvati alias sati, transformed herself into Ten God- desses in order to frighten Siva, when the latter refused her from going to attend the sacrifice of Daksa Prajapati (Father of Parvati alias sati). These Ten Goddesses are known as Dasamahavidya like Kali, Tara, Sodasi, Bhu- vaneswari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhuma- vati, Vagala, Matangi and Kamala etc (Das- gupta 1977: 901). Tantric texts further allude to the circumstances of the emanation of Devi Chinnamasta. According to Kubjika Tantra, Devi Parvati cut-off her own head and nour- ished her attendants, Dakini and Varnani by the blood that came out from her throat. Henceforth Parvati came to be known as Chinnamasta (Mishra 1990: 52). The Dhyana (Hymn) of Chinnamasta alludes to her iconography, that she is head- less having two hands; right hand holds dagger or disc, left hand carries severed head (Chinnamasta tatha Chinna, Chinna Mun- dava-Dharini). She is attended by two sakhis (attendant) on either side. Three streams of blood come out from the chopped off throat and fall into the mouth of the sakhis (Sat- apathy 1991: 145-146). Her right leg is in front, while the left leg is a little behind. She is naked (Digambari), fearful in appearance and usually exhibited in standing posture on Rati and Kama who are involved in inverted coitus (Satapathy 1991: 145-146). It shows thus her sexual aspect or her intimate con- nection with sex. This feature is also high- lighted in her Dhyana: - "Kunti Kum udini Kulia Kurukulla Karalika Kameswari Kamamata Kamatapa Vimochani" (Sahasranama) In view of her nourishing feature, she has also been praised as "Jagat Vandya Jagat Pujya Jagat Prana-Pärayani", Chinnamasta of Hindu Tantra may be equated with Vajrayogini of Buddhist Tantra. Consequently, the Vajrayogini motif of Buddist art seems to be the replica of the former (Bhattacharya 1968: 247-248). It seems that the various forms of mother goddess (including the goddesses of Dasa-</page><page sequence="6">316 Bulletin of the Deccan College 62-63 (2002-2003) mahavidya) originally belong to different folk culutures and social substrata. Between the first century A.D. and the tenth century A.D., these goddesses were absorbed with a uni- versal mother goddess in Indian culture (Das- gupta 1977: 72). In Parvati legend, therefore, her sexual aspect, nourishing feature and headless con- tour are commonly met with. Analogy can be drawn in this respect from the "Sri' and "Laksmi" concept in art and literature. The sexual aspect of earlier images of "Sri' was evinced in the "Personified Yoni type" having squatting posture of the deity. The squatting posture is a prescribed position of women during child birth as out- lined in Charaka and Susruta Samhita (Jan- seen 1991: 461); yet, the said posture is also a prescribed posture of "Kamasastriya Vandha" (coitus) (Desai 1975:15). In fact, in the tribal culture of India often the outstretched leģ posture of female is noticed. One such instance is a painting in Gotul or Youth Dormitory of Muria rtibe of Bastar region of Madhya Pradesh (Middle India) (Elwin 1998: 36, Fig.-I). Sexuality and sexual foreplay are intimately associated with the youth dormitory of the Tribais. The out- stretched leg posture or semi-squatting posi- tion of the motif consequently convey the sense of "Kama' (sexuality). At the same time, sexuality correlates with fertility and fertility ritual or vice-versa (Lannoy 1971: 41-42). Belief in the relation of sex and vegetative fertility is also fath- omed among the tribais of Eastern India like the Oraons. Santals and the Mundas (Bagchi 1980: 162-163). The village goddesses of ferility embody very often, the composite features of sex and fertility. As such, numer- ous female deities of fertility nature either in anthropomorphic shape or in aniconic fea- tures are commonly found in peasant India. High regard is accorded to the womenfolk, who combine sexuality and fertility, like cop- ulation, conception and birth. The idea tra- versed to the art tradition of India, where erotic art is found fused with fertility sym- bolism (Lannoy 1971: 41-42). The cult of goddess "Sri" therefore had direct bearing on sexuality and fertility (nourishment feature). Literary texts like Sankhayana grihasutra also bring out her profile as goddess of sex and fertility. Srisukta of Rigveda, further describes her as "Arda,' as such, she was recokned as the guardian deity of farmers (Desai 1975: 18); she, therefore, embodies in herself vegetative fertility or the nourshing element. Just before the 1st century A.D. "Sri" was assimilated with other goddesses like Lakshmi, Prithvi, Sasthi, Raka, Jaya, Sachi etc. (Gonda 1900:217). The cult of "Sri" was also assimilated in Buddhist culture. Goddess Lakshi alias "Sri1 has been exhibited between two Husks, who pour water on her head to keep her "Arda1. In Buddist art she is some- times fashioned in "personified yoni type' fig- urine. Such type of motfs have been retrieved from the Buddist art centres like Sanchi, Bharhut, Kosambi and Buddhgaya (Gonda 1900:217). Goddess 'Sri' has also been equated with corn in Jaiminiya Brahman (Dhavalikar 1979-80: 32). She has also been described in Padmapurana and Visnudharmottara Purana as "Lotus-headed" (Ibid.). Thus, her lotus- head aspect betokens her vegetative fertility feature. At the same time her headless con- tour, being deviod of anthropomorphic head, is conspicuous (Mishra 2000). She, therefore, has very often been equated with Sakambari, as one covered with vegetation or the "herb nourishing goddess." Sakambari is also an epithet of goddess Durga. Indeed at one time, Devi Durga had been conceived as goddess of vegetation (Wilkins 1900: 306). In the evolution of Durga-Parvati and Sri- Laksmi concept, therefore, the cardinal traits</page><page sequence="7">Headless Contour in the Art Tradition of Orissa, Eastern India 317 like headless, amorous feature and fertility/ nourishment aspects are commonly met with. In Brahmanical tradition, moreover, although Durga-Parvati and Sri-Laksmi, appear dis- tinct, very often, they are also considered as one. They had a common source of origin; that the goddesses were different manifesta- tions of a single universal mother goddess is also apparent from the Mahabharata, which appends Durga stotra (Mahabharata, IV, 6.). Their close affinity, however, is discerned from the Gupta coins, where Laksmi is shown as seated on lion, the mount of goddess Durga (Altekar 1954:23). As such, it seems that both the goddesses had a common source of origin. In this con- text, the fertility deity of Mohenjodaro and the Inamgaon headless clay figurine may be reiterated as being the forerunner of Durga- Pärvati alias Sri-Laksmi (Mishra 2000). It is heartening to note further that the head- less (devoid of anthropomorphic head) so- called Lajja Gauri, combines in herself these common characteristics of Durga-Parvati alias Sri-Lakshmi. Covertly, sometime the artist, therefore, in order to exemplify the Durga- Lakshmi traits in the person of headless god- dess, alludes to the cardinal emblems of the Saiva-Sakta and Vaishnava creeds. Some of the examples may be furnished here: that the Lajja-Gauri plaque discovered from Padri (Ist century A.D.) displays the small figure Ganesh, Nandi and severed human head (Shinde 1994: 481-485). The Lajja-Gauri icon retrieved from Mandhal, Maharastra (3rd century A.D.), shows Linga, Vrisava and lion's head by its side (Janssen 1991: 464). A damaged plaque of Lajja-Gauri from Ter (Ter Museum) shows the deity as armless and lotus-headed. The bull faces the linga on the right edge and the devotee and lion faces are carved on the left edge (Bolon 1992: 44-45). Similarly, the Vaishnavite emblem conch is noticed in another Lajja-Gauri plaque of Ter Museum (Bolon 1992: 45). Moreover very often Lajja-Gauri image is also found amidst Saptamatrika (Bolon 1986: 51). However, the important realization aris- ing from the above duscussion is that Mother Goddess worship goes back at least to the inception of Indian civilization and culture. From the 1st century A.D. numerous Mother Goddesses came to the forefront. Although these goddesses appear different at a superfi- cial level, yet all of them fuse together in one universal mother goddess. (II) Chinnamasta and Sakambari, other manifestations of the great mother-goddess, moreover, combine in themselves the cardi- nal traits of Lajja-Gauri or headless deity like headlessness, sexuality, fertility and nourish- ing aspect (Mishra 2000). Headless Goddess versus Devi Sakambari In our present context, however, it is goddess Sakambari whose iconography and iconology seem to tally well with the headless goddess. Laksmi Tantra alludes to the origin of Sakambari during the fourteenth cycle of vaiv- asata manvantara, the blue coloured Sakam- bari manifested from the body of Parvati (Tat- tawananda 1970: 120-123). The lotus head of the deity as cited already, cognates the motif with Sri-Laksmi. Sanskrit literature fur- ther reveals the link of Sakambari with veg- etative fertility. Sakambari is known to have lived a thousand Divya (Divine) years only on vegetables (Bagchi 1980: 162). In the Sri- Chandi portion of Markandeya Purana, it has been pointed out that the worship of Sakambari soon bestows all kinds of inex- haustible store of food and drink (Tattwa- nanda 1970: 120-123). Furthermore, in Devi Mahatmaya, Sakambari declares to provide the whole world including the gods with nourishing vegetable produced from its body</page><page sequence="8">318 Bulletin of the Deccan College 62-63 (2002-2003) until the rains came (Markandeya Purana, 91,43,44). As such, she came to be wor- shipped in India at the time of drought and famine. Sakambari-Mahatmya, a section of Skan- dapurana, describes the sacred place Maha- kuta as the original abode of Devi Sakambari (Dhavalikar 1996: 116). Mahakuta region, identified with Badami (Bijapur district, Kar- nataka) is full of archaeological ruins, where a nude torso of female with all the insignia of headless goddess, often called Lajja-Gauri has been discovered. The nude torso there- fore seems to be the representation of deity Sakambhari (Dhavalikar 1996: 116). The stone plaques, which contain the head- less figurines, recovered from the Nuapada dis- trict of modern Orissa appear to be none other than goddess Sakambari (Mishra 2000). Drought Situation in Nuapada Region and the Necessity of Propitiating the Deity The precedding pages show, therefore, that the headless goddess was none other than Sakambari, the manifestation of Durga- Pärvati but equated with Laksmi: veneration of such a deity was felt necessary to ward off drought and famine in Indian culture. Hosts of scholars have hitherto studied such headless icons recovered from South India, Deccan and middle India, which witnessed drought and arid climate during the post- Gupta period (Dhavalikar 1996: 114). The present finding of two such figurines, carved on stone plaques, are not only unique in East- ern India, but tell the tale of perennial drought situation in Nuapada region of Orissa; this necessitated the carving of such motif in the sphere of art for the purpose of worship. Nuapada district in Orissa is a drought prone region in Indian peninsula. Frequent occurrence of starvation deaths in this eco- zone has drawn the nation's sympathy and support. On the other hand, Nuapada boasts of the effloresence of culture and civilisation from early history up to pre-medievel period. There was a flourishing urban civilization in Maraguda valley, whose excavated relics unfold the prospserity of the land (Patel 1993: 11, 35, 37). Maraguda was the epi- centre of the famous Sarabapuriya dynasty during the 6th-7th centuries A.D. (Tiwari 1984: 143-144). The Chinese pilgrim Hieun- Tsang, who visited South Kosala during the 7th century A.D. has left a graphic account about its capital city, which is ably substan- tiated by its antiquities (Singhdeo 1987: 8). The prosperity of Nuapada region, however, did not last long. During the early part of 8th century A.D. the Sarbapuriya dynansty began to disintegrate and subsequently Maraguda city complex was deserted and liquidated, as is the case with other urban centres of India like Champa, Vaisali, Pàtaliputra and Vara- nasi. One of the major factors of the downfall of Maraguda civilization of Nuapada could be the climatic changes, resulting in drought and famine. The discovery of art objects of headless contour (Category - I) representing the goddess, identified with Sakambari is a pointer to prevailing arid climate, drought and famine in Nuapada zone of Eastern India during the 8th and 9th centuries A.D. Category - II Two other headless icons encountered in Junagarh (Old Fort) of Kalahandi district, Orissa, are not only unique but also per- plexing. Although there is no such standard text on the iconography of the headless figure sculpture, yet mythical embellishment of headless contour in the literary tradition of the East is well fathomed. One such awe- struck reference is found in the Milinda- Panho, in connection with the great struggle between the Nandas and the Maury as :- " When one great Head Holocaust has taken place ,</page><page sequence="9">Headless Contour in the Art Tradition of Orissa, Eastern India 319 by which is meant the slaughter of Ten thousand elephants and a Lac of horses and Five thousand Charioteers and a Hundred Kotis of soldiers on foot, then the Headless corpses arise and dance in frenzy over the battlefield (Raychaudhury 1972: 210) The myth of the rise of split-head corpse in the event of bloody encounter, was an age- old belief among the Indian people. On the other hand, the description of headless contour in normal circumstances is not wanting in Indian literature. Ramayana of poet Valmiki (Aranya Kanda, Canto, 69) fur- ther provides a graphic account of the demon known as "kavandha', who came across Ram- achandra during the latter' s sojourn in the Dandaka forest. The poet writes thus:- "Asedatuchha Tadraksa Sthabubhau Pramukhesthitam vibrudham asirogrivam kavandhamu-daremukham. " (V.R. Aranya Kanda, Canto, 69) According to Ramayana, the headless demon who encountered Ramachandra in Dandaka forest was called "Kavandha". It appears that in view of the lack of throat and head, the demon was designated as kavandha by poet Valmiki. But demon kavandha had his mouth and face on the belly. From the depic- tion of poet Valmiki, it is also apparent that the body of Kavandha was like a blue mountain and is two armed (V.R. Aranya Kanda, 69). These literary references, however, show that headless figure was well known in Indian tradition. But the sculptures of Junagarh do not unfold any such iconographie feature to link with the headless contour of either one of the aforesaid literary fictions. In reverse, the throatless and headless contour of the sculptures partly share the iconographie fea- tures of the goddess Chinnamasta. The Saiva-Sakta Tantric tradition and its sacred literature reveal the headless divine male principle as a counterpart of headless female energy. In the hoary antiquity of Saiva-Sakta creed, the idea is embodied that male principle is the best support of energy whose quality is feminine. It led eventually to the fruition of the concept of Siva-Sakti (Colaavala 1980: 20). Siva and Sakti are two aspects of the same truth, the static and the dynamic, the negative and the positive, the abstract and the concrete and the male and the female (Dasgupta 1977: 82). According to the second concept, neither of it is real without the other as Sakti tannot be conceived of without Siva, so also Siva becomes Save (dead) without Sakti (Ibid.)è The third view makes Sakti the highest truth and Siva is conceived of as the best support of Sakti. Siva therefore is invariably found to be entangled with his Sakti or vice-versa. Tantric texts further elaborate this con- cept in Dasamahavidya or Ten Goddesses, who emanated from the primordial mother goddess, Durga-Parvati alias Sati (Woodroffe 1978: 260). In the Tantric text, these ten goddesses (Mahavidya) have also been con- ceived as "Bhairavi1. Todala Tantra thus pos- tulates nine Bhairavas as the consorts of these nine Bhairavis of Mahavidya (Mishra 1990: 52). Devi Dhuma Vati being widow, no Bhai- rava is assigned to her. Devi Chinnamasta of Mahavidya, therefore, has her Bhairava known as Kavandha or "Kavandha Bhairava" (Ibid) who was deemed to be the best sup- port of Devi Chinnamasta. As such, the god Kavandha Bhairava appropriates the cardi- nal physical traits of Chinnamasta and Bhai- rava aspect in his person. In the delineation of Kavandha Bhairava, therefore, some cardinal features and attri- butes of Devi Chinnamasta like headlessness, nudity, and two arms with attributes are dis-</page><page sequence="10">320 Bulletin of the Deccan College 62-63 (2002-2003) cerned. But at the same time, to demon- strate the Bhairava aspect, the deity is also shown along with the dog on the pedestal. The headless icons of Junagarh (Category - II) can thus be successfully identified as Kavandha Bhairava, a composite figure of Chinnamasta and Bhairava. Kalahandi region of modern Orissa breathes with strong Saiva-Sakta tradition. The presiding deity of the land is goddess Manikeswari, whose worship began in the land from the 10th century A.D., during the reign of Chindakanaga dynsty (Mishra 1992: 38). Deity Manikeswari has been con- ceived as none other than Devi Chinnamasta of Dasamahavidya both in iconography and iconology contexts (Mishra 1992: 38). Consequently, it is customary to install and worship her consort, Kavandha Bhairava in the land. It can be conjectured at the pres- ent state of our knowledge that the modelling and installation of Kavandha Bhairava in the temple art of the land was inspired by Saiva- Sakta Tantra. A brick temple of Kakta creed, appears to have been constructed in about 10th century A.D. in Junagarh where the god Kavandha Bhairava was installed as Par- swadevata of the shrine.
