<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Archaeological Wealth ofAncient Trace Ivan Venedikov Professor National Archaeological Institute Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia Whoever travels in Bulgaria today has noticed the countless grass-covered Thracian burial mounds that dot the plains and hilly regions. Here, as all over Europe, they are the most important sources for the study of ancient cultures. Besides the rich and interesting finds, there are stone tombs within these mounds that reveal something of the history of Thracian architecture. These burial mounds have produced jewelry worn by women, arms borne by men, the ornaments of their cuirasses and shields and the trappings of their horses, vessels made of clay, bronze, glass, silver, and gold, and countless other articles used in daily life. The treasures hidden in the earth are of no less im- portance. Composed of wonderful gold and silver vases, of coins in circulation in Thrace, and sometimes of jewels and ornaments made of precious metals, they all complete the picture of the development of Thracian culture. The Thracian settlements are being carefully studied. However, in this country, as in the Eastern kingdoms, it is the palaces of the kings that would provide a fuller picture of the achievements of Thracian architecture. The greater number of them, however, still escape the archaeologist's eye; the only residence of Thracian rulers discovered so far is Seuthopolis, capital of one of the Thracian kings, Seuthes III, who reigned in the period of Alexander the Great and Lysimachus. In offering a selection of Thracian wealth it should be borne in mind that it does not come from the whole of ancient Thrace, but only that part which is now within the present boundaries of Bulgaria. It originates there- fore from an area of only 110,000 sq. km., yet it shows a variety not to be found in any other country, and which is due largely to the proximity of Thrace to the great cultures of the first millennium B.C. This variety was the fruit of the inner development of Thrace, which, lying as it did between several cultures totally different in character from one another, adopted elements from them all. For Thrace, which was a European country, had a culture that was not very different from those of the neighboring countries of central and western Europe. However, Thrace was very near Greece and was divided from Asia Minor by only two straits, neither of them wider than a big river. Persia, the most highly cultured country of the East, which had absorbed the cultures of almost all the peoples she had conquered (Assyrians, Babylonians, Urartians, Phrygians, Lydians, and Cari- ans, and even the Bithynian Thracians), lay beyond those two narrow straits. On the other hand, the Greeks sur- rounded her on all sides. Their colonies sprang up along the entire coast of Asia Minor, of southern Russia, and of Thrace herself. Lastly, we should not forget the Scyth- ians of southern Russia, to whom research workers assign a considerable contribution to the development of Thracian culture. Situated on the outskirts of four very different cultures, Thrace could most easily pass from within the range of one into the range of another, ac- cepting elements from all these cultures. Moreover, when it is borne in mind that in the last three centuries of the first millennium B.C. the Celts and, after them, the Romans penetrated deep into the Balkan Peninsula, we cannot expect a steady and calm development in Thrace, such as has been observed in western or central Europe. The Thracian material and spiritual culture, highly original and richly colored by fruitful interrelations, is the result of many centuries of dramatic historical devel- opment, and can be considered one of the most beauti- ful and brilliant stones in the mosaic of civilizations in the period of the slave-owning society.

The forms of its artifacts were original, and seem to have occurred spon- taneously without evidence of any earlier developments in the country. This culture belonged to an unknown and mysterious people. Scholars cannot explain it, but ascribe to it a slow and regular growth. This culture ap- peared throughout almost the entire country at the same time. It is possible, however, to find certain similarities between Thrace and Asia Minor during this period. In Asia Minor the walls of forts were made of stone and those of houses of lath and plaster; in Thrace both types of walls were made of lath and plaster. The burial mounds were similar in both regions. Local pot- tery, gracefully made from its very beginnings, was often brightly colored and richly ornamented. In Thrace, as in Asia Minor, images of the mother-goddess pre- dominated in idols made of clay or bone, whether as pregnant women, women in labor, or mothers. About the end of the fourth millennium, this culture reached its zenith. Models of houses were made of pot- tery, and the first stone sculptures and sickles (figure 4) made of antlers, with flint cutting edges, were developed. These examples, too, have close parallels in Asia Minor. It often happens that accepted opinions about a given society, previously thought to be primitive and back- ward, are seriously upset by the discovery of a necropolis such as the one near Varna dating back to the end of the fourth millenium B.C. The richness of its treasures, especially the considerable quantity of gold jewelry, in- dicates that these were the tombs of rulers. At a later date, about 2800 B.C., during the Bronze Age, far-reaching changes took place. These changes, connected with a strongly centralized rule, contributed to the disappearance of all traces of this culture. The decline that followed does not permit us to present many works of the Early and Middle Bronze ages. Here we are restricted to the Late Bronze Age, which was already part of the Thracian culture. 1 * Female idol. Bone, height 15 cm. (57/8 in.).

They were dis- covered in Tombs 1 and 36 of the necropolis, where digging has been in progress since 1972, and are shown to the public for the first time in this exhibition. We are most grateful to the director of the excavation, Re- search Fellow Ivan S. Ivanov, for permission to show these objects, only part of this unique find. Digging is still in progress at the site, and so far forty-four tombs have been brought to light, in many of which there are similar articles. Some of the tombs have no skeletons and were probably symbolic burials, or cenotaphs. This necropolis offers surprising information about a highly organized society, with the beginnings of social differ- entiation, existing in the Balkan Peninsula at the end of the Chalcolithic Age. 5 ?

In Greek legends the history of the Achaean kings of Mycenae is interwoven with that of the Thracian kings. This has led many scholars, who consider the Iliad and the Odyssey as a source for the earliest history of the people of the Aegean, to believe that the culture dis- covered in Thrace belonged to the Thracians mentioned in these legends. In the age of Orpheus, of Maron, or of Diomedes, whose horses tore strangers to pieces, Troy dominated the Hellespont. To the east of that city lay the king- dom of the Hittites; to the west, in the southern part of Macedonia, lay the land of the Phrygians; while the Scythians and the Paeonians had not yet settled in cen- tral Russia and in Macedonia. In this period, as yet only slightly known, the life of the Thracian tribes did not differ greatly from that of the other peoples in the northern part of the Balkan Peninsula. Pottery was the most widespread art, and the distant influence of Mycenae is to be felt in it; but Thracian pottery differs from Mycenaean both in form and in orna- mentation. The proportions are rather heavy, and the vessels are ornamented with incisions (see figure 8) and encrustations of a white paste; these characteristics also apply to vessels shaped like birds and to idols in the form of women (figure 7), who wear long dresses like those of Mycenaean figures. The distinct features of both coun- tries are once more found in the western Balkan Range, in the Carpathians, and along the middle and lower reaches of the Danube. The pottery of southern and western Thrace is similar in character, but it is more primitive, as, in general, the entire culture of the regions in the northwest was calmer than in the south and the east-a fact that may be due to the way of life. The bronze weapons of the Thracians of this period are found throughout the Danubian Plain, where two- edged swords with a very long point were used. The rapier with a cross-shaped handle, which made thrusting possible, was also known. The rapiers found in Thrace are of the same quality as those discovered in Greece, and it was thought for a long time that they had been imported from Mycenae. However, aside from articles common to Thracians and 7 * Female idol. Pottery, height 11.5 cm. (41/2 in.). Late Bronze Age, 1500-1200 B.C., Orsoya, near Lom. Museum of History, Lom, Inv.

Improved ornamentation indicates they were intended for Thracian chieftains, and shows how the technique of the master bronze workers had been perfected to satisfy the wishes of their clients. On the other hand, the discovery of these matrices, which were probably deliberately buried, is evidence of the incursion into Thrace of a population that surely did not possess such highly perfected articles. Some articles cast in similar matrices were found in Romania, and therefore provide evidence of a local art. Another treasure, that of Vulchitrun, demonstrates the skill of the craftsmen better still, not only in cast metal but also in wrought metal. 9 * Spearheads. Bronze, heights 19.2 cm.

Nos. 3193, 3192 The Vulchitrun Treasure [ Color plate 1 This treasure is a masterpiece of the Thracian gold- smith's art. Composed of a large, two-handled vessel, a triple vase, four cups, and seven lids, for a total weight of 12.5 kg. (about 271/2 lbs.), it is the most important find of gold articles to come to light in Thrace. Some archaeologists date it to the end of the Early Iron Age, others to the Bronze Age. More recent dis- coveries of the Iron Age, as well as two finds in Sofia and Belogradets, near Provadia, prove that metal was not so finely worked in the Iron Age; on the other hand, the gold studs with conical heads, which rivet the han- dles of the large vessel (figure 11), and the studs of the cups (figure 11) are reminiscent of those found on Cretan-Mycenaean swords. In addition, the silver inlays on the lids also offer evidence in support of the Late Bronze Age date. The most characteristic feature of this treasure, be- sides the simplicity of its forms, is the sparing use of ornament, which is limited to the grooved handles. This shows a sense of proportion not to be found in later articles. However, the Thracian goldworkers were quite able to make intricate articles, as is apparent in the triple vessel (figures 12, 13). The electrum handle in the form of a trident and the small silver tubes connect- ing the elements prove that the master who cast them worked with the same precision as a goldsmith. The craftsmanship of the large lids (color plate 1) reveals the same skill: under the handles a bronze pad, which continues in a bronze circle, provides a firm hold, and an openwork cross strengthens the handles. In this period the difference in quality between pot- tery and metalwork is proof of the power of the aristoc- racy, which had craftsmen at its disposal well able to satisfy its requirements and refined taste. Perhaps origi- nally hidden in the walls of the palace of a Thracian chieftain, this treasure also indicates that political power was linked with religious power, for such a find was, indeed, intended for ritual use. Originally this treasure must have been far greater. The gold lids should have belonged to seven vessels, all of them larger than the two-handled lidless one. The number of large vessels was probably considerably greater than that of the small ones, which are shaped as though they were intended for pouring rather than for drinking. These cups were used to fill the big ves- sels with liquid, which was then poured into the cups of each individual, a ceremony that accompanied the mystical rites of the Thracians. The triple vessel, whose strange form proves the ritual nature of the find, must have been used to mix three different liquids. In composition the Vulchitrun treasure may be com- pared to another one, which bears an inscribed dedica- tion to the Thracian deity Pyrmerulas. However, the latter is of a much later date, since it belongs to the period of the Roman Empire. 13</page><page sequence="8">12 12 * Triple vase. Gold, width 23.9 cm. (93/8 in.); weight 1190 gr.

No name of a king or a chieftain, and no exact records of any events have come down to us in myths and legends. Only burial mounds remain in large numbers, for at that time they were very widespread. The archaeologi- cal name for this period is the Early Iron Age, and it can also be defined as the era of megaliths, or of geo- metric art. No matter how the invasions may have taken place in the twelfth century B.C., it is obvious that the farther to the southeast they reached, the more important they became. These movements from Europe into Asia passed through Thrace in great waves. The Thracian population experienced times of hardship, and some had to flee the broad plains and take refuge in the mountainous regions of Sakar and Strandja, in the Rhodopes, and in the east- ern sections of the Balkan Range. Huge stone tombs appeared in the southeastern re- gions when these invasions came to an end. They were dolmens built of very large slabs. The walls of these tombs, made of one or two slabs, surrounded a burial chamber, which could be from 2 to 2.5 m. (61/2-8 ft.) long, with a single slab as a cover. Sometimes a pas- sage (dromos) and an antechamber led to the burial chamber, over which were constructed a false vault and a mound. In the southeast, rock-cut tombs were also found. All these tombs were intended solely for the aristocracy of the tribe. They were robbed in antiquity, in the Middle Ages, and in still more recent times, so that today only pottery is to be found in the dolmens and the rock tombs. But the richest archaeological dis- coveries were made in northwestern Thrace, where the work of craftsmen was also intended for the aristocracy. The chief finds in women's tombs were fibulae, while in the men's there were weapons and horse trappings. As in Greece, pottery of this period in Thrace re- turned to old techniques and old decorative designs. However, the execution was simpler, sometimes even clumsy. The principal ornament was composed of circles with a dot in the middle, connected by triangles and other geometrical motifs, loops, or spirals. These de- signs were usually painted and often encrusted with white paint and at times were also worked in relief. Metalwork did not reach the perfection of former ages. In eastern Thrace the fibulae went back to models from the Ionian Islands, while in western Thrace those in vogue came from Greece and Macedonia. The small bronze figures of animals made in this period are char- 14 * Ritual axe. Bronze, height 10.6 cm. (41/8 in.). 10th-7th centuries B.C., provenance unknown. Archaeological Museum, Sofia, Inv.

Certain royal insignia, known in Asia Minor, also appeared among the Thracians under the influence of the East; most notable is the iron scepter, whose upper part, made of bronze, is in the form of an axe (figure 14) and is ornamented with heads or animal figures, which in Thrace included rams, bulls, goats, stags, horses, and birds. Whereas in the East axes had wooden handles, 15</page><page sequence="10">18 20 19 T ' iI 16 * Headstall. Bronze, height 7 cm. (23/4 in.). 6th century B.C., Sophronievo, Vrasta district.

This type of axe spread far to the northwest and has been found in the cemeteries at Hallstatt (Austria). Other royal insignia of this period, also mentioned by Homer in connection with Caria and Lydia, are the headstalls decorated with appliques that were known throughout the northern part of the Balkan Peninsula. These appliques, cast in bronze, sometimes took the form of little crosses, circles, or rosettes. The only head- stall with animal ornamentation is the one from Sophro- nievo (figure 16). The statuette of a stag from Sevlievo (figure 17) should be mentioned among the animal figures: its symmetrical antlers end in stylized animal 18 * Bowl. Gold, diameter 24 cm. (97/6 in.).

Goldwork of this period is represented by several pairs of earrings in the form of open rings and by brace- lets. Few other examples have survived, but what has come down to us is particularly important, such as a gold bowl (figure 18), dated about 700 B.C., from Kazichane, a suburb of Sofia. Its simple ornamentation is reminiscent of pottery, heavy and clumsy both in form and decoration: the ribs are deep and irregular and at some distance from one another. This is curious, when we remember that a large number of pottery vessels are thought to be imitations of metalwork. 16</page><page sequence="11">1 y 1) ) ;"</page><page sequence="12">I -:- i , W" 6-0. r :.t- *^L :w -:OW --- \ a-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--: - - &lt; '--:1 !!wl s 1 -.....6. : , ^ t - , 6 # ! ?:.

In the mid-sixth century B.C. Thrace attained a high degree of development, as is evidenced by the finds from many burial mounds. Her culture was at its zenith, but at the same time underwent far-reaching changes. The Greeks founded a great number of colonies, until the whole Thracian coast was in their hands. Here they built forts, temples, theaters, and rich houses; they made statues and reliefs and vessels of bronze, gold, and silver. Under the influence of the Orient, they wore garments made of expensive fabrics and gold jewelry and intro- duced filigree work. A rich inhabitant of Thrace could easily buy Greek works of art, either in the cities on the coast or in the large centers of continental Greece. Greek coins also made their appearance in the Thracian marketplaces along with these objects. On the other hand, the shores of Asia Minor were in the hands of the Persian Achaemenids, who ruled these territories until Alexander the Great conquered them. Everything was adapted to the Persian monetary system. Thrace could not fail to be influenced by this Eastern power, and even the Greek colonies on her shores ex- tended their contacts with the East. In the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. trade flourished between the interior of Thrace and the towns of Cyzicus on the Propontis in Asia Minor, Appollonia on the European shores of the Black Sea, and Parium, as well as the Thracian Chersonese on the Hellespont. All of the treasures of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. found in Thrace contain coins of these places. At that time, through her trade with the Persians and the Greeks, Thrace emerged from the general isolation of the previous period. The Thracian burials are a good illustration of this change. In them has been found much gold jewelry, as well as alabaster vessels, glass, and classical pottery. At the end of the fourth century B.C. imports from Greece increased greatly, and at the same time many works were made by Thracian master craftsmen under the influence of the Orient. The Mounds of Douvanli [Color plates 2, 3] Of the numerous mounds near the village of Douvanli, in the Plovdiv district of southern Bulgaria, about fifty have been excavated to date. They belong to various periods from the sixth to the first centuries B.C. Five of the mounds proved to be the greatest discoveries in Thracian archaeology, and the articles found in them could well fill a large museum. They were the richest mounds, and also the oldest, since they date back to 21 * Mug. (Illustrated here more than twice actual size.) Silver, height 8.6 cm. (33/8 in.); weight 236 gr.

[Color plates 3, 41 Numerous articles found in various mounds in the course of chance discoveries reveal the splendor sur- rounding the Thracian aristocracy at the end of the sixth and during the fifth centuries B.C. Such are the finds at Tatarevo, Turnichene, Svetlen, Rouvets, Pas- tousha, Pesnopoi, Sadovets, Staro Selo, Chervenkova Mogila, near Brezovo, Mazrachevo, Daskal Athanas- sovo, Ezerovo, and Skrebetno. It is also evident that the kinds of military equipment (helmets and cuirasses) and jewelry (rings, torques, bracelets, and earrings) found at Douvanli were widespread throughout the Thracian area (see figures 30-32). The presence of the same elements of grave furniture is a characteristic feature of all these tombs. Changes took place only at the turn of the fifth and fourth cen- turies B.C., when, more particularly, hydriai (water jars) and helmets disappeared, being replaced by other vases and another type of armor. Two objects of particular importance among the chance finds, and those which are difficult to date with any certainty, should be mentioned here: a belt (figure 29) from Lovets and a matrix (color plate 4) from Gurchinovo that was used in ornamenting beakers. Beakers with this kind of decoration have not been found in Bulgaria, but did come to light in another region of Thrace, now in Romania, as part of a treasure found at Agighiol. It contained a silver beaker, whose ornamentation can be compared to that of the Gurchi- novo matrix. The principal motif is a stag, with antlers ending in the shape of animal heads. The stag is used in connection with other animal motifs. The belt from Lovets has a type of ornamentation often found on gold pectorals from Anatolia: a com- position of hunting scenes symmetrically placed on both sides of a plant motif. This motif is influenced by an Oriental model, the symbol of the Tree of Life.</page><page sequence="18">Color Plates Plate 1 Thracian craftsman.

The grave goods included this magnificent greave and small gold mug. The mug has a handle in the shape of a square knot, known as the knot of Herakles. The body is decorated with two winged quadrigas, thought to represent the chariot of Apollo. While much detail has been lavished on the horses' harnesses, the chariots are summarily executed. The mouth of the mug is beaded, and the lip is decorated with a kymation; another kymation is around the base. Palmettes encircle the shoulder, and one separates the quadrigas. The mug's shape and part of its decoration (knot-handle, kymation on top) are Greek, but the figure style represents local taste. The top of the greave, covering the kneecap, is decorated with the head of a woman, following the Greek tradition in which tops of greaves were sometimes rendered as gorgoneia, or medusa heads. Two locks of her hair are snakes that ter- minate in ferocious lions; two lion-headed snakes, emerging from snail shells, form a clavicle; the stylized calf muscles are snakes terminating in the heads and wings of kete, or sea monsters. (Because of its fragility, the greave is shown in the exhibition in facsimile; the photograph at the right is that of the original.) The disk-shaped upper part of the earrings is decorated with tendrils and rosettes, and looped to it is a crescent-shaped pendant with spirals and rosettes. Suspended from the crescent are beads; attached to the upper rim are sirens with outspread wings. Mug: height 9 cm. (31/2 in.) ; weight 240 gr. Greave: silver and gold, height 46 cm. (181/8 in.).

Its sheer weight in gold-almost 131/2 pounds- is in itself most impressive, but its rich decoration, interesting iconography, superb workmanship, and excellent preservation all add to the uniqueness of the discovery. Since the inscribed weights are expressed in the monetary unit of Lampsakos, on the Asiatic shores of the Dardanelles, it may be assumed that the nine vessels were made there. This splendid amphora-rhyton is of a shape that was originally Persian, but the artist has turned the handles into two opposing centaurs, one of which is shown in the detail above, and has liberally covered the entire body with figural scenes. The main subject, framed above and below by floral ornament, is an attack on a palace (see color plate 11). On the bottom are shown Silenus and the infant Herakles strangling snakes and two heads of Negroes, whose mouths form the openings of the rhyton; arranged opposite each other, they allow the wine to flow in two streams. Perhaps the amphora-rhyton was used to drink blood brotherhood or in treaty ceremonies. Gold, height 28 cm. (11 in.) ; weight 1695.25 gr. Turn of the 4th-3rd centuries B.C.

The only group of mounds of this period to have been discovered and systematically studied is at Mezek. In other cases the objects were obtained from chance finds, which did not yield an archaeological context. It should, moreover, be noted that despite the existence of the Odrysian kingdom (mainly in the southeast), the richest finds were discovered in the north on both sides of the Balkan Range. The splendor of Douvanli should there- fore be attributed to tribes that were detached from the kingdom of the Odrysians or had never been subjected by it. The crisis that this kingdom experienced at the end of the fifth and in the early fourth centuries B.C. is very clearly shown by these archaeological finds. Another interesting fact revealed by these excavations is the widespread distribution of bronze and silver plaques for horse trappings (figures 33-35, 37). Al- though some archaeologists explain this by the presence of the Scythians, it should be noted that there were no Scythians in southeastern Thrace, which bordered on Asia Minor, or in the northeast, the region nearer to the Scythians. No matter how strange it may seem, it is pre- cisely in northwest Thrace that a large number of these plaques were found. Phialai (figure 38) and vases made of silver were most widespread, and ornaments for shields appeared at the same time. These articles were orna- mented with animal motifs, treated in a style close to that of the Scythians, but preserving a certain purely Achae- menid character. In contrast to the Geometric period, the animals most frequently depicted were lions, bears, wolves, griffins, and lion-griffins, not counting other imaginary animals with the bodies of snakes, which are quite strange, and alien to old Thracian art. Human fig- ures were also shown, and sometimes we come across a whole composition in which a deity in the form of a horseman occupies the central place. Fighting animals 35 and animal motifs are depicted, motifs whose complexity sometimes makes interpretation difficult, and these works are close to Scythian art. Certain distinctive features none- theless reveal the originality of Thracian art. 33 * Lion's-head headstall. Silver, height 4.7 cm. (11e6 in.).

The Greeks who lived in the coastal cities of Thrace introduced many Oriental elements into their metalwork under the influence of the Achaemenids. The rhyton (a drinking vessel) in the form of a human or an animal head appeared in Thrace at the same time, and also much jewelry, brought from Greek workshops, which was ornamented with animals: heads of lions, bulls, or horned lions. The Greek craftsmen tried to achieve an even greater styli- zation, and so did the Thracian craftsmen; for example, muscles and wrinkles around the mouth and eyes were treated in a very abstract manner. In brief, the finds from this period indicate influences from the East, which increased and culminated with the campaigns of Alexander the Great in Asia. 36 * Helmet. Bronze, height 23.7 cm.

The trea- sure consists of a phiale (color plate 11) and eight rhyta (color plates 9-14); one is in the form of an amphora, while the others are shaped like the heads of women and animals and the protome of a goat. These vessels have openings at the base through which the liquid flowed and which had to be stopped when the vessel was filled. The amphora has two openings, making it possible for two persons to drink from it at the same time, and it was perhaps intended for blood-brotherhood or treaty cere- monies. These articles seem to have been made by several craftsmen at Lampsakos, on the Asiatic shores of the Dardanelles; the inscriptions give the actual weight of some of the vessels in terms of staters of Lampsakos. The subjects and ornamentation (an attack on a pal- ace, the Judgment of Paris, and bacchantes) belong to the Hellenistic repertory; also in accordance with the style of this period, the craftsman placed the figures in tense attitudes and emphasized their muscles and strong facial expressions. 39 -Vase.

In 280 B.C. upon the death of Lysimachus, the last great ruler of Thrace, Thracian culture began to decline. The conflicts between this ambitious general of Alexander the Great and the Thracian kings and the wars against the other successors had exhausted the economic and mili- tary resources of Thrace. This opened the way for a new conqueror to enter the country: the Celts of western Europe who ravaged the Thracian regions and the Greek cities of the coast. In 216 B.C. their rule was overthrown. In the same year the Romans reached the Adriatic coast of the Balkan Peninsula. After engaging the Macedoni- ans (who had tried to restore their rule over Thrace in three prolonged and consecutive wars), and occupying Macedonia in 164 B.C., the Romans invaded Thrace, first aiding the Odrysians and then the other Thracian tribes. In the second half of the first century B.C., when the Thracian tribes in the northwest had been subjected, the Odrysian kingdom became a Roman protectorate that preserved its independence until A.D. 49. This period can be called the epoch of great invasions from the West. There are few monuments connected with it: the campaigns of the Macedonians, the Celts, and the Romans devastated the region, and the mounds of the third to first centuries B.C. offer only ordinary articles. The fibulae, swords, and shield plaques are identical with those of central Europe and Italy. North of the Balkan Range, as in southern Russia, occur the so- called Sarmatian monuments, the treasures of Galiche and Yakimovo. The coins found in them are imitations of Macedonian coins and of those struck in Thasos. 46 * Phalera, or chest ornament, in a silver bowl. Bowl: diameter 14.7 cm. (53/4 in.).

Archaeological Museum, Sofia, Inv. No. 4766 The Roman Period [Color plates 15-17] After the Roman conquest, Thrace was divided into three provinces, Macedonia, Moesia, and Thracia. Ur- banization increased, and the Thracian cities possessed almost all the usual features of Roman cities: architec- ture on a large scale, sculpture, paintings, and the ap- plied arts, the latter always influenced by Hellenistic art. The religion of the conquerors was also established in the urban centers, while the Thracian deities, displaced and isolated in solitary areas, were only worshiped in the inaccessible mountains. Rich cemeteries with tombstones, marble statues, and painted tombs surrounded the cities. But, in general, the Thracians remained true to the old burial customs and preserved their burial mounds right down to the Christian era. In the mounds of the Roman period, helmet masks (color plate 16, figure 49) and plaques (color plate 15 ) of the types found in Stara Zagora (the second half of the first century B.C.) came to light, objects that had always been considered Eastern in character. However, most typical of this period are the Thracian chariots, which were discovered in the mounds with horses in rich trappings still harnessed to them. The articles from Shishkovtsi (figures 51-5 3 ) give us an idea of the orna- mentation of these chariots, of which more than fifty have been found. Most of the art originating in Roman Thrace is quite similar to that found in all the Roman provinces of Eur- ope: portraits on gravestones, reliefs and statues, bronze vessels, glass and silver vases, weapons, silver and gold jewelry. However, there is a group of articles found only in Thrace: votive tablets depicting Zeus (Jupiter), Hera (Juno), Asklepios (Aesculapius, god of medicine) and Hygieia (goddess of health), Sylvanus, Dionysos (Bacchus), Pan, satyrs and maenads, Herakles (Her- cules), and other Greek and Roman deities. The most interesting are the reliefs that depict a horseman (figure 54), the Thracian "Hero," a strange local deity who combined the characteristics of many gods (Asklepios, Zeus, Dionysos, Sylvanus, Apollo, Pluto, and Mithras). The "Hero" is also portrayed in bronze (color plate 17), and there is no doubt that these figures,found only in Thrace, were locally made. Another frequently treated theme is that of the three nymphs, depicted as goddesses of humility and fertility, whose images are similar to those of the Three Graces. The Roman period is represented in the exhibition by typically Thracian monuments. Gold and silver jewelry was then also very plentiful in Thrace; the pieces shown are from the Nikolayevo treasure (figure 50, color plate 16). 67 49 50</page><page sequence="62">1 51-53 * Chariot ornaments from Shishkovtsi, Kyustendil district.
