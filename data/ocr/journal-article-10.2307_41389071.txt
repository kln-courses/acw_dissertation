<plain_text><page sequence="1">53 Alexander Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere: The Construction Site of Counter-History by Miriam Hansen Contemporary German Cinema is making its way into Film Stu- dies as an instance of deviation- a deviation from dominant classical narrative, but, in the same move, also a deviation from modernist, deconstructive modes of cinema and the theoretical apparatus support- ing them. Thomas Elsaesser considers recent German films "to represent... a confirmation of Baudry's and Metz's arguments [concern- ing the mirroring effect, the specularization of subject/object relations, the construction of a transcendental subject], and at the same time [to oifer] a textual practice which might make apparent a dimension elided or repressed in The Imaginary Signifier Z'1 In his analysis of voyeurism and fascination in the films of Fassbinder, Elsaesser suggests that we read strategies of spectator-positioning in historical terms, recognizing a particular subjectivity at stake in the specular organization of the sub- ject. The specularization of all social relations, which Fassbinder fore- grounds in his films, is undeniably linked to the problematic constitu- tion of social identity under German fascism, a system that- for pur- poses of its own- promoted a massive specularization of public and private life. By implicating the spectator in analogous constellations, Fassbinder both mobilizes and critically dissects a specific social ima- ginary as it sustained the Third Reich and continued to haunt political and social relations under its legal successor, the Federal Republic of Germany. While Elsaesser grants Metz's concept of primary identification a descriptive validity with regard to "the specularization of consciousness and social production," he clearly states the inadequacy of Metz's categories for grasping the dialectics of cinema and history at work in this process. Consequently, Elsaesser himself opens his framework to includes sources that reflect on the formation of subject positions within the German tradition- for example, in the case of Fassbinder, the work of Alexander Mitscherlich, or, in a recent essay on Syberberg, the writings of Ernst Bloch and of the Frankfurt School.2 In a similar vein, Timothy Corrigan situates his readings of Wenders, Schroeter, and other German filmmakers in a field of force between Hollywood</page><page sequence="2">54 DISCOURSE and the problematic continuity of German history; using the reception- alist approach of Hans-Robert Jauss, he persistently mediates the con- ceptual framework of film theory with the hermeneutical challenge posed by the films under consideration.3 Such a confrontation of discourses not only succeeds in reinvesting psychoanalytic-semiological categories with social and cultural specificity, but also demonstrates its usefulness in comparison with German criticism of German films which has as yet to reach a certain level of theoretical self-consciousness. The challenge recent German cinema presents to the foreign critic and, by the same token, to a type of film theory inspired mostly by French sources, consists in the particular way in which these films relate to their primary context of reception, that is to the historically determined public sphere of West Germany. Beyond the commonplace assertion that all reception differs according to gender, class, ethnic, national and even personal backgrounds of the empirical spectator, there is a wide range of possibilities in which cinema traditions either suppress or productively interact with the specificity of their audiences. If Hollywood represents the prime instance of an economically and ideologically inherent tendency towards universalization,4 recent Ger- man cinema, for the most part, situates itself in a countercurrent: the reference to a specific context of reception seems to be built into these films at the level of organization of discourse and articulation of subject positions. Thus they demand a space, both in film theory and criticism, for the dimensions of history, memory, and experience, discourses in the combat zone between public and private realms. My own interest in Alexander Kluge is motivated, in part, by a growing dissatisfaction with the degree of abstractness prevalent in current discourse on film, in particular a tendency to bury the object of analysis under the structure of the methodological framework employed. Kluge's work offers an alternative on at least three distinct yet inseparable levels: his theoretical writings (which situate him in the tradition of the Frankfurt School); his concept of the cinema as put into political practice through legal and organizational intervention; and his textual practices which sometimes take the shape of films (as opposed to literary activities). While Kluge's work raises a number of issues that overlap with the concerns of current film theory, it also presents a number of stra- tegies beyond the scope of academic discourse. This includes Kluge's attempt- in a Utopian and a pragmatic sense- to bridge the gap between transcendental cinematic subject and empirical spectator; cru- cial to this project is the category of Erfahrung (only inadequately translatable as "experience") which, through a dialectics of representa- tion and repression, links subjectivity to the concept of Öffentlichkeit, the public sphere. Another impulse to revision can be gained from Kluge's reshuffling of "history" and "discourse," in a direction that</page><page sequence="3">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 5 S reclaims the cinema as a space for historical practice, the work of remembering and rewriting. Moreover, Kluge's textual practices sug- gest a reconsideration of the problem of figuration in film, a set of questions occluded by the collapse of rhetoric into semiotics. The figurative dimension in Kluge's work informs his theoretical discourse as well and thus provides an alternative to the stylistic poverty of much of current film theory and analysis. Finally, Kluge's cinema offers a different conception of the relationship between theory and practice, both in the films themselves and with regard to the cinema's function within the public sphere. The difficulty in writing about Kluge lies precisely in this entan- glement of theory and practice, the degree to which his films can be read as an illustration of his theory while the theory itself operates within a larger context of practice. Analyzing the films as textual sys- tems in their own right is necessary, but such analysis must not lose sight of their contextual orientation. Therefore, I will begin with a dis- cussion of Germany in Autumn, a film that has received modest atten- tion in this country yet is also an excellent example of how crucial the primary context of reception is to such a film's functioning as a text. As a second step, I will sketch out some of the theoretical assumptions underlying Kluge's work. A final section will deal with the discursive practices projected by his films, in particular the fragmentation of pri- mary identification by means of quotation, figuration, voice-over, and character-look. 1. Deutschland im Herbst, Germars/ in Autumn- one could not have thought of a better title for this film: the name of a place that no longer exists (legally, at least, there are two German states), a temporal reference to a season rather than a point in history. The title evokes a sense of loss, mitigated by the rhythm of nature, luminous colors of falling leaves, a vision rendered opaque by mists and melancholia. Hardly appropriate: the harvest was violent, reaped in cold blood, the crop German in its peculiar monstrosity. While Romantic irony may be a convenient label for this incongruity, it does not explain sufficiently what moved intellectuals on the left to resort to such troping. The obvious answer, implied yet elided in the title phrase, pertains to the historical moment at which the events of September/October 1977 imposed themselves on public discourse.5 The kidnapping and killing of Schleyer, the highjacking of a Lufthansa plane and its liberation at Mogadishu, the alleged suicides of Baader, Meinhof, and Raspe in the prison of Stuttgart-Stammheim-</page><page sequence="4">56 DISCOURSE this catastrophic concatenation of events not only created a fatal sense of 'history-in-the-making,' but also provoked a crisis of historical cons- ciousness which temporarily bared the precarious foundations of Ger- man national identity. As Kluge observed at the time, the moment of shock briefly illuminated the falsely integrated elements of German his- tory as a fundamentally impossible relationship.6 The moment of illumination, however, was already one of distortion, unlikely to yield what Benjamin has called a dialectical leap in the open air of history- rather a tiger's leap, not into, but out of the past. Whereas public recognition of the historical implications of the crisis was drowned in a wave of patriotism, especially after the "vic- tory" of Mogadishu,7 there remained an increasing awareness among German leftists and liberals that the systematic misencounters between the warring forces, the Bundeskriminalamt and the Rote Armee Fraktion, were outgrowths, in method and mentality, of a particularly fatal Ger- man tradition. The terrorists who were ostracized by the press as "Hitler's children" had found little support in the mainstream of the German left; yet their fate is inscribed, with all its consequences, in the history of oppositional movements in Germany, a history of too many failures. In addition to grief and disorientation, intellectuals and activists were struck by the recognition that the complicity of antagonis- tic scenarios had effectively eliminated the space from which to articu- late strategies for a more humane society. If the left was to redefine its positions as a political subject, it had to acknowledge- and attempt to describe- the complex series of displacements that had produced the current catastrophe. As an effort to turn paralysis into political action, Germany in Autumn has become part of the historical moment that prompted its production. The format of the film, its modes of address, the hetero- geneity of styles and discourses are inseparable from its conditions of production, including the mode of collaboration, the sense of urgency, the compromises of topicality. Intended for immediate reception, the film defines its interventionist status in response to the crisis of leftist subjectivity within an increasingly restrictive public sphere: what was at stake was not merely an alternative version of political events but the very possibility of an alternative political disourse which would allow for contradictions, revisions, and the freedom- and "labor"- of mourning. What technically looks like a collage of documentary and fictional episodes, is more significantly a confrontation of the personal and the political, a challenge to the institutionalized divisions of public and private spheres. When criticized for the omission of "the workers' point-of-view," the filmmakers replied that they could only, "in all honesty, represent the subjective reactions of a specific group of bour- geois intellectuals."8 Bourgeois intellectuals, certainly, and mostly male; yet also a group of filmmakers who problematize their public role</page><page sequence="5">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 57 along with that of their medium. Strategically situated at the beginning of the film, the episode by and with Fassbinder forcefully dramatizes the distance between auteur cinema and public sphere.9 Cutting through conventionally segregated levels of enunciation, Fassbinder transforms the enclosed space of his apartment into a public stage that exposes the personal-political double-bind of the individual artist. Taken by itself, the episode would probably leave the spectator in the grip of left-wing melancholia, but contextualized as it is by the rest of the film, it assumes the function of a thesis proposed for dialectical scrutiny. Moreover, the pessimistic stylization of Fassbinder's persona is counterbalanced by his actual participation in a collective project. The collaboration of nine directors, writers, several leading actors and the editor, Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus resulted in a format somewhat different from the usual omnibus film. The montage structure of Ger- many in Autumn, created by the editor in close consultation with Kluge, intercuts various episodes and documentary footage with little respect for auteurial signatures, thus emphasizing the priority of a collective textual practice over the contributions of individual stars. With this emphasis, Germany in Autumn has become a catalyst for a new "politics of production" ( Produktionspolitik ) which involves collaboration films as well as the coordination of projects and programming strategies.10 Paradoxical as it may seem, this concept of cooperation revolves around the figure of Kluge, whose activities as a film-maker, lawyer, lobbyist, writer, teacher, and theorist have decisively shaped the development of German cinema since Oberhausen. Such a statement neither implies him to be the secret super-author of Produktionspolitik- let alone the ulterior source of enunciation for a film like Germany in Autumn- not does it mean to efface the dimension of personal style from the project of collectivity. In Kluge's view, the only viable form of Autorenkino (inadequately translated by the term "auteur cinema") is one of cooperation: only if independent film- makers combine their forces can radically personal modes of cinema hope to have an impact on the public sphere. The very notion, and particular assessment, of the public sphere- a keyword in post-student movement oppositional politics- owes much to Kluge's influential study, co-authored with Oskar Negt, on Public Sphere and Experience (1972). 11 As a medium that organizes human needs and qualities in a social form, the existing public sphere maintains a claim to be representative while excluding large areas of people's experience. Among the media that increasingly constitute the public sphere, the cinema lags behind on account of its primarily artisa- nal mode of production (In Germany, at least), preserving a certain degree of independence thanks to state and television funding.12 This ironic constellation provides the cinema with a potential for creating an alternative, oppositional public sphere wthin the larger one, addressing</page><page sequence="6">58 DISCOURSE itself precisely to the kinds of experience repressed by the latter. Thus, the cinema's intervention aims not only at the systematic non- or misrepresentation of specific issues- e.g., family, factory, security, war, and Nazism- but also at the structure of the public sphere itself. Germany in Autumn (which, needless to say, received neither federal nor television funding) illustrates this strategy in its two-fold direction. Beyond the topical intervention- providing an oppositional public sphere for the events of fall '77- the film presents a critique of, as well as an alternative to, the discourse of German television as it had once more demonstrated its impermeability to crucial layers of experi- ence. Given its public status in the Federal Republic, television occu- pies a precarious position in the changing structure of the public sphere. Not quite subsumed by the sphere of commodity circulation as the privately owned media would have it, televison has largely taken over the function- the prerogatives as well as limitations- of a defunct bour- geois public sphere (among them the patronage of non-commercial filmmaking). As Negt and Kluge show in their study, the mechanisms of television as a "program industry" organize- or rather de- organize- the viewers' experience on the principle of a pluralistic abun- dance of material and a systematic shortage of time, thus creating a mediocre amalgam of "general" interests with the exclusion of vital interests of both entertainment and information. In a situation as criti- cal as the one at hand, the pluralistic pretensions faded into news black-out and self-censorship; the supposed autonomy of cultural pro- grams collapsed as the representatives of the public tried to prove themselves defenders of the state. Böll/SchlöndorfTs satire (in Ger- many in Autumn) on a program committee's decision to postpone Sophocles' Antigone seems to exaggerate only in its attempt at unification and closure, hardly, however, in its assessment of the situa- tion. Throughout Germany in Autumn, television is inscribed as a prob- lematic counterpoint to the enterprise of the film itself. A pan to the spotlight of a TV crew filming the Schleyer ceremony establishes its own crew on the opposition bench. Polemically rejecting the hierarchy of perception ordained by the dramaturgy of TV news, Schlöndorff/Kluge's camera pans to the margins of so-called public events, discovering there a Turkish labor immigrant stopped by the pol- ice for carrying a rifle with which he had planned to shoot a pigeon for his lunch. During the video transmission of the ceremony for employ- ees of Daimler-Benz, a series of identical, larger than life overhead pro- jections of Schleyer's photograph, shot across a series of black mirror- finished antique Mercedes models, hyperbolizes the official effort to preserve Schleyer's image while making no attempt to save his life. Later on, we witness Herbert Wehner's speech at the Social Democratic Party convention on a monitor in the foreground, whereas the speaker</page><page sequence="7">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 59 himself is seen only from an oblique angle in the background. Finally, after Böll/Schlöndorifs explicit treatment of television politics, the ter- rorists' funeral intercuts video footage with 35mm, underlining the impossibility of mourning in the face of an ubiquitous host of police cameras; the slow pace and duration of the whole sequence reclaims its significance as a public event. More important than these various instances, however, is the way in which the format of the film reflects- and at the same time subverts- the overall structure of television programming. The juxta- position of documentary and fictional genres, of newsreel and historical footage, interview, show, thriller, and short film episodes, the con- stantly shifting modes of representation and address indeed parallel if not exceed the formal diversity of daily television programs. Whereas the programming policies of public television impose an exclusive, uni- fying order on the diversity of people's experience, thereby effectively reducing the scope of the public sphere, Germany in Autumn offers an even more diverse, self-consciously heterogeneous structure with a different timing, allowing space for contingencies, incongruities and contradictions to unfold- ruptures through which the discourse of the spectator is provoked to enter. Such exercise in subversive mimicry finally points to the institu- tional differences between cinema and television- differences all too often obliterated by the TV-sponsored 'amphibious' film. The diversity that may lull the TV-spectator into the complacent security of a world- wise subject of the state is more likely to irritate the spectator in the cinema who, after all, came to see a single feature film. From the per- spective of the latter, Germany in Autumn appears to be employing the staple techniques of avant-garde films for disrupting primary identification, deconstructing the subject-effect of conventional cinema. The critical distance imposed on the spectator is, however, linked to a recognition of the programming strategies of television and their decep- tive subject constructions. Thus, the conjunction of distance and fami- liarity produces the conditions for a pragmatic subjectivity, a subjec- tivity that has to define its position within the public sphere. In an even more pragmatic sense, the cinema, as an urban public space, offers a social configuration different from that of television which assumes its public function in a privatized environment, i.e., people's living rooms. Collective reception, as classical cinema has taught us to forget, still holds the potential of communicative interaction, which is the prerequisite of political practice. The ambitious project of transforming the public sphere for and through an alternative cinematic discourse, inspires Kluge's film prac- tice as much as his theorizing. The Utopian springboard in Kluge's con- cept of cinema is what he calls "the film in the head of the spectator." In a Marxian mode of prolepsis, he declares that the only real means of</page><page sequence="8">60 DISCOURSE production reside with the spectators, in their desires, their needs and fantasies, however alienated, and in their collective yet historically privatized experience. All the official agencies of the mass media- TV studios, video corporations, filmmakers- only parade as producers, determining the forms and conditions under which the so-called consu- mers produce and reproduce the medium of experience. The mass media are thus "standing on their heads," and a materialist practice, consequentiallly, would have to put them on their feet, i.e., organize them according to the interests of the spectators.13 The notion of the film in the spectator's head prompts a com- parison with psychoanalytic film theory, in particular the writings of Metz in The Imaginary Signifier.14 In the classic essay of the same title, Metz analyzes spectatorship as a repressed instance of cinematic textu- ality, elaborating on mechanisms such as the mirroring effect and pri- mary identification, the transcendental determination of the perceiving subject, the fetishistic structure of representation. The spectator is seen as a vital link in a chain of many mirrors, endlessly rehearsing- as the institution demands- the circular motions of desire. As indicated above, this construction tends to reduce spectatorship to its cinematic positionality and the psychoanalytic framework employed in analyzing it, while leaving more specific- historical, social, cultural- qualifications outside of theory. These however are crucial to Kluge's concept of the film in the spectator's head which subsumes psychoanalytic considera- tions within the larger- and necessarily more vague- category of experience. The film in the head of the spectator, after all, is a trope, rather than a scientific term, and as such figures the political priority of the spectator's experience as the basis of production. "Cinema learns from the spectator, the spectator does not learn from the cinema. Unfor- tunately, historical development has reversed this relationship- spectators have allowed themselves to have their experience constricted by cinematic and TV conventions."15 The obvious difference at stake is one between a filmmaker's program, prone to indulge in utopianism, and an academic theory, risking the fallacy of normative descriptive- ness. Granting a divergence of premises, there remains nonetheless a common ground of empirical observation; it is on the basis of the latter that Kluge insists on an irreducible degree of autonomy in the spectator's involvement, even with films that make every effort to elim- inate it. A potential incongruity between the spectator's disposition and the organization of desire on the screen emerges in a reading, some- what against the grain, of Metz's essay, "The Fiction Film and Its Spectator," a Freudian analysis which is in many ways closer to Kluge's notions than the essentially Lacanian framework of "The Imaginary Signifier." Considering the convergence of the impression of reality,</page><page sequence="9">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 61 the impression of the dream and the impression of the daydream in the "confused territory" of the filmic state, Metz elaborates in detail on the contradictions involved in that process- contradictions between dream- ing and being awake, between pleasure and reality principles, and, most important, between the individual's authorship and the heteronomy of the cinematic phantasy. With regard to the latter, he even goes so far as to admit cautiously a social dimension to the cinema's solution to the contradictions at hand. "The material existence of the filmic images.. .helps recover some advantages that compensate more or less completely for the images' immediately alien origin: their profound conformity to one's own phantasy is never guaranteed, but when chance permits this to a sufficient degree, the satisfaction-the feeling of a little miracle, as in the state of shared amorous passion- results in a sort of effect, rare in nature, which can be defined as the temporary rupture of a quite ordinary solitude."16 The promise of collectivity is nothing more than an effect, to be sure, and thus in the realm of ideol- ogy, but nevertheless it is a potential to be appropriated by an alterna- tive practice. Such practice, however, is not one of Metz's most press- ing concerns, as his stabs in the direction of avant-garde cinema- in the same essay- once again confirm. The division of labor between the film theorist and the avant- garde practitioner is also reflected in a difference of emphasis when it comes to the point at which spectator and film collude, respectively col- lide. Whereas Metz, in "The Imaginary Signifier," proceeds from the mirroring effect of the cinematic image and the illusion of imaginary plenitude it temporarily affords, Kluge's strategic focus is on the moment of negation: the empty space between shots (Leerstelle), and the emptying out of the image itself, the non-image (Nichtbild, rhyming with the German word Lichtbild, i.e., slide, transparency).17 Frequently mocking Adorno's apothegm, "I love to go to the movies, the only thing that bothers me is the image on the screen," Kluge himself invests in a similar aesthetics of negativity. Over against the flood of images that beckons the spectator of the contemporary Hollywood pro- duct, an alternative cinema has to engender a resistance- in the psychoanalytic sense- resistances that provoke the spectator into auto- nomous co-authorship. Hence the importance of cuts, ruptures, silences, breaks- whatever may counteract the obtrusive referentiality of the image flow; hence the emphasis on a radical practice of montage. Kluge's concept of montage (which I discuss in greater detail else- where18) can be roughly characterized in analogy to Barthes's notion of the "writerly' text, a self-conscious interplay of discourses depending for its meaning of the discursive activity of the reader/ spectator. 19 The individual montage sequence does not produce a new, unifying idea, but, on the contrary, aims to dissolve fixed positions of meaning through a continuous overlayering and unmaking of one discourse by</page><page sequence="10">62 DISCOURSE another, thus constructing multiple points of entry for the spectator. Whereas representationalist concepts of montage, even if they function dialectically, tend to reinscribe a unified spectator through the backdoor of an overall narrative design, Kluge's mode of montage provides both an excess and an indeterminacy of meanings and subject positions. In a number of ways to be discussed below, primary identification is broken down, fragmented into a kaleidoscopic oscillation which, ideally, approaches the multiplicity of empirical spectators and the diversity of their experience. Kluge claims, with materialist pathos, that this type of montage is patterned on the stream of associations in the human mind, on what he calls "the ten-thousand-year-old cinema in people's heads," to which technical inventions like camera, projector, and screen only responded on an industrial scale.20 If this is an allusion to Bazin, it is certainly a polemical one: Kluge's leap into the beginnings of history is motivated by intentions both more radically mimetic and more radically construc- tivist than that parallel may suggest. The stream of associations Kluge invokes has clearly psychoanalytic underpinnings, mediating as it does between fact and phantasy. In cinematic terms, this approach calls for a crossing of documentary and fictional genres. Moreover, its implica- tions for the practice of montage reach into the fields of literature (the example of Joyce), rhetoric, and epistemology. In a late essay strongly influenced by Kluge, Adorno points out that the images of the interior monologue (i.e., the subjective mode of experience on which an aesthetics of film should base itself) are set off against each other in their very movement, therein resembling the flow of writing under our eyes which is similarly discontinuous in its discrete signs; in the same essay, Adorno refers to the practice of montage as arranging things "in a constellation akin to that of writing."21 Taking into account the problematic status of "writing" (Schrift) in Adorno's philosophy,22 the filmmaker's task would be analogous to that of dialec- tical thought- unmasking the ideology of images, revealing them as allegories in disguise, makig them readable, decipherable, through cinematic means of figuration. Translated into Kluge's concept of mon- tage, this involves a highly mediated discourse, figuring itself forth in self-conscious construction, which sets it quite apart from what is com- monly understood by associational montage. The grounding of Kluge's concept of montage in the stream of associations can be further elucidated with recourse to the notion of "inner speech" which Paul Willeman, resuming the work of Boris Eikenbaum, applies to cinematic disburse. While all visual perception is structured by verbal discourse, Willemen argues, this inner speech is nevertheless different from manifest speech. The greater tendency towards predication and condensation allows inner speech to "freely integrate thing-representations in its chain of signifiers, a facility it</page><page sequence="11">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 63 shares with cinema."23 A cinematic practice that foregrounds the work- ings of inner speech (rather than suppressing its verbality, as does clas- sical cinema) would restore to the image ("thing-representation") its high degree of indeterminacy and thus its poetic function, dispelling the illusionist myth of visual accuracy. In a similar vein, Kluge adheres to the photographe capability of the camera, for precisely this reason: if discursively contextualized visual particularity can itself function as a critique of language and thereby set off new processes of figuration.24 In a less technical sense, Kluge's images, charged with connota- tions of memory and phantasy, aspire to the condition of Benjamin's "dialectical image"- an image that flashes up in the moment of recog- nition, its shock arresting and crystallizing configurations of thought into a monad, capturing and redeeming a moment of the past.25 This notion, criticized as it was by the more rationalistic Adorno, is as cru- cial to Benjamin's philosophy of history as it appears to be to Kluge's historical projects- in film, fictional prose, and theory26- projects of deconstruction and redemption. "The relationship of a Love Story to History," sequence from The Patriot (1979). Voice-over accompanying this and the following shots: "Rome, August 1939.

Now they are expected to resume the love story of August 1939."</page><page sequence="12">64 DISCOURSE At this point, it seems useful to confront Kluge's work with the Metzian distinction between histoire and discours, based on the lingustic distinction between énoncé and énonciation.27 The completeness and seeming self-sufficiency of the narrative, the pastness and immutability of events thus related, is what links "history" and "story" in the French word histoire and the German word Geschichte. So we know that the absence of an enunciating subject is ideological, that historical events are never closed, that they do not have the status of natural facts or transparent artifacts. But how do we distinguish between "story" and "history," how do the functions of narrative and discourse intersect with either of them? The construction of these issues in linguistic terms seems to occlude a dimension which is certainly not outside languge, yet is by no means exhausted or sufficiently defined by the economy of signification: the specific relationship of historical indi- viduals to history. To invoke Marx- a rather old-fashioned Marx as it were- human beings do make their own history, but not of their own free will. The deconstruction of subject ideology notwithstanding, the question remains as to why the enormous productivity of generations has yielded so little praxis, so little self-determination by human beings of their real conditions of existence. Or rather, and this is a question particularly relevant to German history, why does it tend to produce the opposite- failure, non-identity, and catastrophe? Kluge proceeds from the assumption that actual life histories are generally not determined by the individuals who live them; instead the catastrophic continuity of history imposes structures of interruption and discontinuity on individual experience. The ideology of the fiction film, i.e., classical narrative, seeks to imprint the structure of the family romance on the world, which Kluge reads as an instance of negative utopianism. The method of the "antagonistic realist," however, the construction of scenes through reduction and interruption, is already prefigured- arbitrarily- by the way in which historical reality interferes with the stories of human life- "empirical forms (Realformen) which history employs to cut human beings to size for its fiction of reality (Real-Roman). "The task of the filmmaker, then, is to provide complex models with which the spectators can organize their experience for and by themselves. "Either social history continues to tell its fiction of reality, regardless of the human beings, or human beings tell their own story, that is, counter-history (Gegengeschichte)."28 The dialectical mediation of the categories of Real-Roman and Gegengeschichte offers an Ац/hebung of the formalist opposition of histoire/discours into a con- cept of praxis, in which the transformation of story into discourse is functionally subjected to the cinema's seeking of access to history. The dialectical conception of histoire and discours enables Kluge to maintain the basically narrative function of cinema, his critique of clas- sical fiction film notwithstanding. The emphasis is on the act of</page><page sequence="13">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 65 narration, not story: "Telling stories, this is precisely my conception of narrative cinema." And he adds slyly, undercutting the seeming simpli- city of his statement, "what else is the history of a country but the vastest narrative surface of all? Not one story but many stories."29 The aspiration of narrative cinema to historical practice, however, requires a radical revision of genre conventions. The division of labor between documentary and fictional genres, according to Kluge, is ideo- logical in that it disregards the coexistence of fact and desire in the human mind; the fiction film falls short because of its repression of his- tory and social experience, the documentary in so far as it adheres to the ideology of representational authenticity which only reduplicates the "wicked fiction of reality."30 As an alternative, Kluge proposes nothing less than a crossing of radical observation and radical fiction which would leave neither genre intact but rather appropriate them both into the field of discourse. 3. In Kluge's films, the field of discourse is projected in a number of ways, the most obvious being the use of quotations- or misquotations- on the level of silent titles and voice-over. Reminis- cent of modernist practices in poetry (e.g., Pound, Eliot), Kluge's quo- tations however show no cultural reverence whatsoever; the sources remain for the most part anonymous or insignificant, and accuracy gives way to usurpation. "Give me a point outside the family and I shall move the world," reads a title from Gelegenheitsarbeit einer Sklavin (Part-Time Work of a Domestic Slave, 1973); or, to take a phrase from Germany in Autumn, rendered by the voice-over, "suicide- the choice of those who have no place in this world" ("Selbstmord begeht, иш nicht in diese Welt passt"), echoing a sentence from Adorno's Aesthe- tische Theorie, "Denn wahr ist nur, was nicht in diese Welt passt. "31 Other quotations present proverbs, set phrases (Redensarten), commonplaces, fragments of discourse that are half-familiar and half-esoteric but mostly forgotten, rendered strange in new constellations. (A similar method is at work in the arrangement of still images and music, that is, second hand music which bears the traces and connotations of previous usage;32 even if referred to a subjective source- as the suicide images or the Deutschlandlied to the mind of Gabi Teichert- these image clus- ters or musical themes more often than not outrun diegetical anchor- ing.) Kluge's obsessive use of quotation marks, figuratively speaking, foregrounds the act of enunciation itself, suspending and simultane- ously provoking the question of authorship: a discourse in search of spectators who can remember and revise. Applied to documentary footage, this strategy attempts the transformation of events- past, completed, "natural"- into instances of discourse. In the Frankfurt film, In Gefahr und grösster Not bringt der Mittelweg den Tod (In Danger and Extremities the Middle Road Leads to Death; co-directed with Edgar Reitz, 1975), the title "Die Sprechweise</page><page sequence="14">66 DISCOURSE öffentlicher Ereignisse" (the diction, or discourse, of public events) introduces a documentary sequence juxtaposing the fortification of an occupied house, a carnivalistic evening of the police choir, the annual convention of astrophysicists and a meeting of junior entrepreneurs. "Punctuating 'representation' with 'formulation,'" as Brecht recom- mended, Kluge raises questions as to who speaks these events, what connects them in their disconnectedness, how dö the different degrees of representation and displacement characterize the structure of the public sphere.33 The most striking instance of events breaking into discourse remains the Talking Knee in Die Patriotin (The Patriot, 1979). This knee belongs to Corporal Wieland, killed in the battle of Stalingrad, and was invented by Mainka-Jellinghaus with reference to a poem by Mor- genstern. Over vast montages of battlefield footage, authentic as well as reconstructed, the Knee tries to refute the fundamental misunder- standing that "the dead are really and simply dead when they die." Insisting on an independent memory of generations of body parts, the Knee defends its right to "talk, talk, talk," even if it doesn't make sense. (Towards the end of the film, the Knee holds forth at length in Latin which is topped off with an even more incomprehensible interpre- tation of the text.) In its discursive confusion, the Knee presents both a parody of and a challenge to the history of books and libraries, as it itself points out, thus hyperbolizing the difficulty of giving history a voice- or rather, many voices- beyond the narrative of histoire, which is what motivates and irritates the film's protagonist, history teacher Gabi Teichert. The character of Gabi Teichert touches on the most interesting yet also problematic device of genre-crossing in Kluge's films; the insertion of a fictional protagonist in an intermittently documentary context. As Kluge maintains in his critique of genre divisions, there can be no objectivity without emotions, intentions, actions, human eyes and ears; in cinematic terms, the spectator needs an instance of secon- dary identification which structures the look in a comprehensible, anthropomorphic way. In Kluge's practice, however, secondary identification remains highly rudimentary, in the measure that the char- acters upon whom it rests are themselves highly fragmentary, artificial figures. Primary identification is not only broken down by the peculiar construction of secondary identification- as Elsaesser shows for the case of Fassbinder- but is problematized from the start, through the inscription of a many-voiced, pragmatically positioned subject. The status of character in Kluge's films is inseparable from its relation to the voice-over, the absent narrator who intervenes, seem- ingly, to mediate the character for the spectator. The relationship of voice-over to character inevitably provokes criticism for its gender- specific division of labor: a male voice- that of the filmmaker himself- speaks a female figure.34 The validity of this criticism hinges,</page><page sequence="15">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 67 in part at least, on the dimension of authority and closure traditionally associated with voice-over narration, especially in its documentary usage. Let us take a brief look at Gabi Teicherťs appearance in Ger- many in Autumn. Over an image of the character getting ready to go out, looking at herself in a mirror, the narrator introduces her as a his- tory teacher in doubt of her profession, since the events of fall '77, now searching for "the foundations of German history." In the next shot she trudges through a deserted winter landscape with a shovel- are we to read this as a literalization of a worn-out trope? After a pause, the voice-over enters again, this time from a different position: "Either she is digging a shelter for World War III, or she is digging for prehis- torical remnants." The uncertainty implied in the alternative- both possibilities making as much and as little sense- subverts the previous assumption of narrative control over character intention; the figure takes on a life of its/her own, as she is engaged in a project that neither narrator nor spectator as yet understand. Taken as a separate strand of discourse, Kluge's voice-over consistently shifts its stance and mode of articulation, deconstructing itself as it goes along. The credibility gap between the first and the second comment as well as the instability and distance of the voice-over/character relationship stimulate the viewer to search for another meaning him/herself. (It has been suggested- as is plausible for a film structured by a series of funerals- that Gabi Teichert is digging a grave; rather than calling this an instance of suppression, I would cite it as an example of how, as Kluge insists, the film's meaning materializes in the spectator's head.) Digging, or, The Archeology of Fairytales, - "how a people works on its desires over a period of eight hundred years."</page><page sequence="16">68 DISCOURSE There is nevertheless, as always, the other source of enunciation: the absent filmmaker who directs, and who might have had in mind Benjamin's Denkbild on remembering as a mode of digging ("Ausgraben und Erinnern"35). If this were the hidden motive behind Gabi Teicherťs arcane archeological activities, the female character would indeed be reduced to an allegory, conceived in the communion of one male intellect with another. As it comes across, however, the allegori- cal effect exceeds the sense of mere personification. Subverting the codes of the psychological vraisemblable, the allegorical conception of Kluge's characters does not pretend to the illusionistic wholeness of conventional female protagonists, but makes the character readable as a construction, as a focal point of intersecting discourses. Thus, she achieves the relative autonomy of a rhetorical figure that defies literal interpretation by its yoking together of incongruous levels of mean- ing.36 Since when, to return to Gabi Teichert, does an allegory take a hot bath to warm her frozen feet? This figurative complexity of character conception owes much to the fact that the actors in Kluge's film not only quote, in the Brechtian tradition, but also improvise. In a film like The Patriot, which neither has a script nor gives direction credit, the dialogues were invented by the actors who speak them. Gabi Teichert as a walking instance of catachresis is as much a creation of the filmmaker as of the actress, Hannelore Hoger, herself. The mock mise-en-scène device of her appearance at the Social Democratic Party convention (only in the course of her actually being there did she transmogrify into a fictional character), the intersection of documentary and fictional space brings out the highly fictional character of the political muscle show.37 The question she asks, deadpan as throughout The Patriot, of individual delegates is as inappropriate in the pragmatic context as it is legitimate from a radical perspective: dissatisfied with the teaching material Ger- man history has provided so far, she demands of these real politicians that they change history- "here and now"- so as to enable her to render German history in a patriotic version.38 The incongruity of goals, means, and results, finally, is inscribed in the specular organization of Kluge's films, in particular the way in which character-look rejects the role it has in traditional narrative. In classical cinema, character-look predominantly serves to stitch spaces together under the laws of diegesis, a process that keeps binding the spectator in a fetishistic structure of representation; when looking itself is figured, it predominantly assumes a voyeuristic and sado-masochistic function.39 Character-look in Kluge's films, however, is rarely part of point-of-view constructions, eyelines hardly ever match, and when a character is shown looking, we can more likely expect a montage cluster of semi-autonomous images than a reverse shot of an object within diegetic space. Character-look far from merely failing to integrate</page><page sequence="17">Kluge, Cinema and the Public Sphere 69 spaces, emphasizes their disparity and incongruity. Conversely, the act of looking is barely tied to action but is motivated by the scopic drive itself, thus establishing an explicit, non-illusionistic relationship with the spectator. The foregrounding of looking as a legitimate activity- even though sometimes practiced in less than legitimate professions- raises the question as to whether there can be a fetishistic mode of scopophi- lia, an alternative to the voyeurism that governs the fiction film and its' spectator.40 Gabi Teichert discusses this alternative in a section of The Patriot entitled "Der Spanner" ("The Peeping Tom"). Staatsschützer M./The Voyeur, addressing the camera, complains he is overworked: as an employee of the State Intelligence Service, he spends his days observing politically suspect individuals while at night he continues this activity for purposes of sexual gratification. In his latter capacity, he can be seen observing Gabi Teichert behind a lit window (she is sup- posed to be ironing, which may be as difficult to discern for the voyeur as it is for the spectator), when a cut to a different angle shows the object of his look entering the very scene of observation. "Don't disturb me, I'm working," he tells her; "I am down here now," she responds. There follows a professional conversation about voyeurism, bracketed by shots through a window of the restaurant where the two are meanwhile seated. Stating an affinity between their occupations- his as an observer of the present, hers as one of the past- Gabi Teichert understands his predicament and gives valuable advice: "If you want to be a voyeur you have to be relaxed," she says, punning on the German words for "voyeur" and "tension." ("Als Spanner müssen Sie entspannen"), and points to the tense area on his forehead. "You make a mistake, you put your eyes on a leash- during the day when you spy on people and at night when you restrict yourself to this perverse business. This hampers the overall vision." As a relaxing exercise, she recommends a rapid blinking of the eyelids, "as if you were taking little shots with a camera. That's how you get the energy to flow." Gabi Teichert speaks for herself. But she is also speaking for Kluge, as she links the redemption of voyeurism as a form of social practice with cinematographic imagery. Refusing to provide the glue between primary and secondary identification, her own look in the film rather functions like a Lacanian gaze,42 the look that pre-exists the sub- ject in the field of desire. Never satisfied nor ever satisfiable, this gaze is challenged by the vast panorama of disasters which is German his- tory. "The more closely you look at a word, the more distantly it looks back," a title in The Patriot quotes from Karl Kraus, and Kluge adds, in capital letters, the word "DEUTSCHLAND." Benjamin, recalling the same phrase in "Hashish in Marseilles," adds from his notes the "surprised comment": "How things withstand the gaze."43 It is only</page><page sequence="18">70 DISCOURSE consistent that the activity of looking figured as a gaze does not yield positive results, or any form of fulfilment: Gabi Teichert never develops a successful teaching unit, Roswitha Bronski fails to take a photograph of the Portuguese construction site, Leni Peickerťs circus never performs, Rita Miiller-Eisert does not report as befits an agent for the GDR.44 That this deferment of success is not just an instance of female incompetence can be seen when contrasted with the role of Franziska Busch in Germany in Autumn. Sinkel-Brustellin's imitation of a Kluge character not only situates her in a relation of property- "in private life she belongs to a TV editor"- but also condescendingly endows her with a film of her own, a meager example of "radical per- ception film." Gabi Teichert's work, eventually, is the work of the film itself. To enlist the scopic drive in the service of deconstruction and redemp- tion is at the core of Kluge's concept of cinema, although not restricted to his authorship. The imbrication of what Kluge has theorized as "female modes of production"45 with his own aesthetic program may appear parasitic at first sight, but cannot be dismissed as such. Gabi Teicher may be Kluge's version of Benjamin's backward flying angel of history, but Hannelore Hoger makes the allegory turn upon itself, as she- together with the Talking Knee- begins to take stock of the wreckage. Her view of history consists of projecting oblique angles onto found material- such as the suicide montage in Germany in Autumn, including the Rommel connection. "Die meiste Zeit ist Gabi Teichert verwirrt. Das ist eine Frage des Zusammenhangs. (Most of the time Gabi Teichert is disoriented. This is a matter of putting things in perspective.)" The notion of Zusammenhang that troubles Gabi Teichert opposes to the fictive coherence of histoire the dialectical historian's task of arranging things in cognitive constellations. In a similar vein, Kluge's films (and also his writings) engage in salvaging historical rubble from the drift of amnesia, taking on objects as cumbersome as the battle of Stalingrad. The method is allegorical, again in the Benjaminian sense, wresting fragments from petrified con- texts and inserting them into a new discourse while preserving their strange and jarring character. An esoteric practice, to be sure, but one that is not content with merely unmaking existent mythologies and suppressions. As part of a larger project, Kluge's texts propose alterna- tive readings of history, readings as indebted to the spirit of Dialectic of Enlightenment as to that of literary modernism. The reorganization of historical experience, a work of memory and morning, inevitably requires deconstructive strategies, yet it pragmatically contextualizes them on the level of what Kluge refers to as a "construction site" ("Baustelle"),46 a cinema that projects discursive models, as in Ger- many in Autumn or The Patriot, for the spectators to construct their own history - "Gegengeschichte.

For the distinction between a voyeurism that allows for the ambivalence of perverse relationships, e.g., that characteristic of the theater and its exhibitionist aspect, and a voyeurism governed by the system of the primal scene and the keyhole, i.e., the fetishis- tic structure of the cinema, see Metz, 4 'History/ Discourse," p. 23; also "The Imaginary Signifier," Screen, p. 64. In addition to the interactional dimension of voyeurism/exhibitionism, I would assume that Kluge's redemption of scopophilia also aims at the subversive elements of that drive as Freud theorized it in his writings on infantile sexuality. In a similar direction cf.
