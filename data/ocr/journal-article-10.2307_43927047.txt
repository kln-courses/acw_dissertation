The East the West and the Unknown The of information vast land mass swept of back Eurasia and was forth a vehicle in antiquity, by which not only tides through and eddies mi- of information swept back and forth in antiquity, not only through mi- gration and trade, but often simply through a complex network of contacts passing seemingly at random with increasing modifications over time and distance. Both China and the Mediterranean world had little accurate knowl- edge of what lay beyond their own purview, relying mostly on myths, and misunderstandings about a world in which they occupied the center of civi- lized humanity Beyond them lay strange beings and supernatural monsters inhabiting the mysterious outer regions. Some of this lore may have been promoted by those who wanted to keep foreigners away, and most can be regarded as pure fantasy, tall tales of the unknown designed to enthrall the gullible. In the Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas) an early Chinese text of pre-Han origins Yu, the legendary founder of the Xia Dynasty, traveled westward to lands inhabited by monstrous human mutants, giant ants, and winged tigers.1 One race is described as having a single eye.2 These, as Mal- lory and Mair point out, are not far removed from the odd beings described by the Greek fabulist Aristeas of Proconnesus whose descriptions of simi- lar oddities of Scythia are preserved by Herodotus.3 The Greek historian's one-eyed people were the Arimaspians whose name was probably a Scythian mistranslation of "owners of horses". The Chinese account of winged tigers can be compared to the griffins, and the elephant-sized ants to the ferocious giant gold-guarding ants of Greek Scythia. The Mutiançi çhuan, a fourth century BCE text now extant only in later works, deals with the fabulous western peregrinations of king Mu (956-918 BCE) of the Zhou Dynasty.4 Mu visited the a place identified as being in the Kunlun Mountains where he came to a lake filled with a myriad of water birds shedding their feathers, a detail echoing Herodotus' odd description of northern Scythia as smoth- ered in falling feathers which he rationalized as snow.5 Accounts of Amazon women, pigmies and cranes, and numerous other tales appear to have been shared by both the East Asia and the West, suggesting that both absorbed 1 See Birrell 1999 for the most recent translation of the text, and Strassberg 2002 for further text and commentary. 2 Ibid., p. 121 (Book 8), p. 187 (Book 17); Strassberg 2002, p. 176 (xlviii: 242), p. 223 (lxxiii: 333). 3 Mallory and Mair 2000, pp. 42-43. 4 Ibid., pp. 54-55. 5 Ibid., loc. cit.</page><page sequence="2">98 MARTHA L. CARTER [2] related versions of these stories despite the vast distances between them. Hence, it would not be surprising to discover that a goddess whose cult was immensely popular during the era of the Han Dynasty had absorbed some characteristics similar to those of a contemporary goddess whose cult was thriving in Iran and Bactria during the same era. The Han Dynasty ; Trade, and the Western Regions In China during the second century BCE Han military power gradually over- came the domination of the warlike barbarian Xiongnu in Xinjiang, and es- tablished military outposts in oasis towns along the trade routes in the edge of the Taklamakan desert, thus allowing trade with the Western Regions to increase without pillage, harassment or onerous imposts. Thanks to the vigorous policies of the emperor Wudi (149-86 BCE) and to the dogged de- termination of his envoy Zhang Qian, China learned much more of what lay to its west, discovering that there were not only marauding tribes but civilized states in existence there where advantages might be gained from trade. Ferghana was discovered to be a land of fortified cities with a dense population, a place where the Chinese found superior horses, grapes made into wine, and alfalfa. Parthian Iran welcomed trade, especially in silk yarn and cloth. The first century BCE was a time when vassal states sent princes to the Chinese court to be educated along with tributary gifts, in exchange for trading opportunities. China in turn gave numerous countries and tribes huge quantities of silk, estimated at ten percent of its state revenue. Iran un- der the Parthians was a great beneficiary of this westward flow of wealth, experiencing an economic and military expansion that culminated in the fa- mous victory over the Romans at Carrhae in Syria where, according to the historian Florus ( Epitome I, xlvi) they awed their Roman adversaries by un- furling large silk banners. 6 The taste for 'serie cloth' increased in the nouveau riche upper classes of Roman Empire of the Augustan Era when ladies of fashion paraded in diaphanous garments of silk gauze.7 Under Tiberius silks for men were banned as too overtly extravagant and effeminate.8 Ironically, it was during the Augustan Era that Former Han China experi- enced a series of crippling natural disasters and political disorder. The reign of the usurper Wang Mang (9 to 25 CE) ended in a civil war and almost ex- terminated Han rule altogether. Due to this series of catastrophes, Chinese control over the Western Regions was destroyed for the next several decades. As the Later Han Dynasty once more reasserted itself militarily, territories and influences that had been lost were slowly regained by extensive military campaigns. By the end of the first century a Han army under general Ban Chao had marched across Xinjiang to Kashgar; but during the interim most 6 Publius Annius Florus , epitome de tito livio bellorum omnium annorum. 7 See Seneca de beneficiti vii, 9; Pliny historia naturalis vi, 17 (20), 54; also Hirth 1975, pp. 257-260. 8 Tacitus annali 11, 33.</page><page sequence="3">[3] CHINA AND THE MYSTERIOUS OCCIDENT 99 of it trade routes to the West had been disrupted at the same time that the Roman world acquired an insatiable desire for silk. This caused a classic eco- nomic problem of demand exceeding supply, with Chinese silk fetching ex- tremely high prices in the Rome. In C.E. 97 Ban Chao sent his emissary Gan Ying through the Pamirs to Parthia to try to reach the Roman Empire, but he was bamboozled by Parthians who frightened him out of continuing beyond the Persian Gulf.9 More successfully, merchant sailors from Egypt and the Arabian Coast began to take advantage of the monsoon winds to speed di- rectly across the Indian Ocean early in the first century of the Common Era, bypassing the Parthian Empire completely to trade in ports on India's west- ern coast.10 Some silk may have filtered to India from Xinjiang to Sogdiana and Bactria, but instability throughout the region of the eastern land routes through Xinjiang made other routes between China and India more attrac- tive. Tellingly, the guidebook of Isadore of Charax sends caravans crossing Iran to Seistan and the Indus Coast.11 Here, newly founded Indo-Scythian kingdoms capitalized on brisk sea and land trade. The large amount of Ro- man first century gold coinage discovered in hoards in South India suggests that Roman sea traders in large merchant vessels were active at ports as far as the Malabar Coast.12 Others, however, were responsible for the hazard- ous journey to the Coromandel Coast and eastward across the Bay of Ben- gal to obtain 'serie cloth'. ii. Indo-Scythians at Kongwangshan By the early first century CE Buddhism was thriving in India and Sri Lan- ka. New converts to Buddhism, especially the Indo-Scythian kingdoms that flourished from trade in their newly established coastal territories were ready to spread its teachings. Buddhism may have reached Eastern Iran before the Common Era, since the Mahãvamsa describes a large delegation of Par- thian Buddhists reaching a Ceylonese Buddhist council in the time of king Dutthagāmani (108-77 BCE).13 Possibly not long after this some foreign Bud- dhists were present in China, although not yet an unidentified minority. The famous dream of the Buddha as a 'golden man by emperor Mingdi in 68 CE and his subsequent mission to the West to bring back scriptures and im- ages is likely to have been a later fabrication to justify the legitimacy of the foreign religion under imperial aegis; but there can be no doubt that by the mid-first century Buddhism was known and tolerated in China, but as a for- 9 Hou Han shu (Xiyu juan) 88.10 (The Kingdom of Anxi). 10 Casson 1989. 11 Schoff 1914, nos. 18-19.

CARTER [4] eign faith with only a minor impact on its intellectual life. 14 The first reliable reference deals to actual Buddhist practice in China lies in the account of the exemplary deeds of a Prince Ying who ruled a small Han fiefdom near the modern port city of Lianyungang in northern Jiangsu between 52 and 70 CE. In a petition to the emperor regarding his moral character it is reported that among other virtues he attended temples of the Buddha and provided food for laymen and monks. (How Han shu, chuan 42, bio. 32) 15 Since these Buddhists are generally thought to have been foreigners centered in a can- tonment near China's coast, it is reasonable to assume that they came by sea rather than by land, a proposition that reinforces the hypothesis that sea trade with India picked up considerably when land routes from China to the west became far more dangerous at the beginning the first century. Sig- nificantly, close to Lianyungang is a rock-faced hill displaying a large num- ber of reliefs, including a scene of the Buddha's Pannirvãna and one of the Màhãsattva Jãtaka where in a former life the Buddha leapt from a cliff to his death in order to feed a hungry tigress about to devour her cubs.16 (Fig. 1) In both the natural shapes of the rock appear to have been used in the defi- nition of the figures. The Pannirvãna relief is unlike any known version from Fig. 1. Drawing of a panoramic view of rock reliefs on the rock face of Kongwan- shan, Jiangsu Province, China. Later Han Era.

See also Zürcher 1957, 1, p. 23 who believes that Buddhism entered China by slow infiltration in the early first century BCE over land routes and consolidated during the first century CE. 15 Prince Ying was evidently trying to get back into the Emperor's good graces. There is no evidence that he was a devoted Buddhist himself, only that he showed generosity toward Buddhism. 16 This discovery was first reported in Wenwu 1981, 7, pp. 1-19, subsequently treated in Wenwu 1982, 9, pp. 61-70.

In the Jãtaka scene the corpse of the bodhisattva has a bare torso, crossed legs and one arm flexed behind his head, in a pose that seems more like relaxation than death. He appears to wear a pointed cap. Three Buddha images are found there, two standing (X2 and X61) and one seated (X76). In a study of the Kongwangshan Bud- dhist figures Marylin Rhie suggests that X2 appears to resemble standing representations of Śakyamuni Buddha on copper coin reverses of Kaniska I whose reign began around 128 CE.17 She also finds the crude, flat linear style of the carvings comparable to that of rock reliefs at Tang-i Sarvak in late second century Parthian Elymais.18 X61 seems to show elements of cos- tume indigenous to China and may be later than X2, perhaps post-Han. The seated Buddha (X76) also appears to be in a more sinified mode. The hap- hazard placement of the reliefs suggests that were probably not all created at the same time. Some are perhaps as early as prince Ying, while the latest are post-Han in date. Other smaller figures scattered around the Buddhist scenes and Buddha images wear Indo-Scythian trousers and pointed caps. Rhie compares a pro- file head (X78) with coin portraits of Vima II Kadphises, (c. 100 CE) Kaniska's immediate predecessor in the Kusāna Dynasty.19 One odd dwarf-like figure (X85) facing frontally with bowed legs and a large belly is reminiscent of the Egyptian god Bes, a grotesque protective deity represented in figurines found throughout Inner Asia in antiquity 20 Rhie tentatively dates the Kongwangshan reliefs to the late second century, noting that such scenes were well-known in Gandhār an art. 2 1 Oddly, there are many renditions of Pannirvãna in Gandhāran art, but she can find only one example of the Mahãsattva Jãtaka scene.22 No Gandhāran representations resemble the Kongwangshan Pannirvãna in style or format. The Buddha image (X2) vaguely echoes Gandhāran types, but is flat and linear like many of the rock reliefs of contemporary Iran. Evidence for the possibility that some of the reliefs might have been created as early as the first century CE is suggested by the unusual presentation of the Pannirvãna scene. By the late second century, during the Kušana Era in Northwest India, this scene had been set into a standard schema and was undoubtedly well- known in other illustrative materials as well. The Kongwangshan Pannirvãna is atypical, suggesting either that it was carved by artisans who had no knowl- 17 Rhie 1999, p. 34, fig. 1.18. It could be that illustrations other than coins were available. We have no drawings or illustrated manuscripts from that era, but it seems reasonable to suggest that two-dimen- sional Buddhist imagery of a portable type existed. Also there is a question of who actually carved the reliefs. They are variable in style and were likely created by a number or different hands some Chinese and some foreigners. 18 Rhie 1999, pp. 32-33. 19 Ibid., pp. 40-41, 45- 20 Hodjash 2000, pp. 61-69. 21 Rhie 1999, pp. 44-45. Rhie notes that some might be later than the Kusāna Era although her referenc- es are from the second century at the latest.

Kunlun, the Han sacred mountain and world axis. (Fig. 2) She sits up- right in Han-style lose sleeved robe with hands clasped in a pose not unlike that of the seat- ed Buddha, and wears a high round-topped headdress, possibly with a peacock-tail shaped ornament hanging on one side of it and ear flaps or hair bunches on either side of her head.24 Her presence above a mélange of Buddhist scenes, Buddha images, and odd groups of Indo-Scythian is puzzling. An obvious rationale might be that since the hill site of Konwangshan was believed to represent the magical mountain in the West where the goddess resided, its Buddhist re- lief scenes and figures were set in that same general location. Also, she might have been shown on her mountaintop presiding over the rest of the imagery to lend the cachet of her popularity to a new and relatively unknown reli- gion in China. We may note that both the Buddhist scenes deal with virtuous death. In Xiwangmďs cult during the Han era she was thought to aid souls in their journey to heaven. As for the foreigners, their presence on her mountain might indicate that they too had been blessed by her in their quest for para- dise. Nevertheless, her presence is notable, having other possible ramifica- tions that will be dealt with below. Fig. 2.

Frontality also exists in some of the earliest Gandhāran Buddhist re- lief scenes, especially from Swat. 24 Li Hung-fu 1982, p. 66, fig. 1; Rhie 1999, pp. 29-30, fig. 1.4a.</page><page sequence="7">[7] CHINA AND THE MYSTERIOUS OCCIDENT IO3 In any event, it is significant that the foreigners represented at Kongwang- shan were most probably seafaring Indo-Scythians, descendents of Eastern Inner Asian peoples historically familiar with China. Among their ancestors were the Yuezhi, nomads who roamed the Gansu Corridor before they were driven far to the West finally settling in Bactria in the mid-second century BCE, the Indo-Parthians whose Iranian forbears had a history of trade with China from the early first century BCE, and Sakas who were dislodged by the flight of the Yuezhi, settling in Seistan, the Indus coast, and Northern India. Parthians probably pioneered both land and sea routes to China from the Persian Gulf and Iran during the first century before the Common Era. During the following decades Indo-Scythians came under nominal Indo-Par- thian rule but flourished in trade with the West from ports at the mouth of the Indus. It is safe to assume that these newcomers to South Asia were not merchant-sailors by tradition, but became so during the early first century, utilizing their recently established ports on the Indus coast for transshipment of Chinese goods, particularly silks bound for the luxury markets of the Ro- man Empire. By that time many Indo-Scythians had become enthusiastic converts to Buddhism, and some of their sea-going mercantile activities ap- pear to have been responsible for its first recorded appearance in China. in. Indo-Scythians in Sichuan One of the earliest Buddha images in China is found in the Mahao Tomb at Leshan known as Cave IX and dated to the late second century of the Later Han period. 25 (Fig. 3) The tomb itself is unusual in that it is rock-cut and faces north and is not an underground structure facing south like most Han tombs. It has an antechamber and three separate shafts, a plan which Rhie suggests is comparable to Kušana Era Buddhist caves at Karatepe in Northern Bactria, dating to the second or third century CE.26 The Buddha image 37 c. in height is carved above the entrance to the middle tomb shaft, evidently an important location for worship. Another Later Han tomb near Leshan has two unfor- tunately badly weathered seated Buddha images in low relief, each above the entrance to a shaft.27 A cursory examination of the Mahao Buddha immedi- ately recalls Kusāņa style seated Buddhas. The treatment of the lower body as a lozenge shape with no indication of turned-over feet is similar to that of the seated Buddha at Kongwangshan. The apparent seated pose with the abhayã mudrã of the right hand, the robe grasped fairly high by the left, and the parallel cascading folds on the chest could have been taken from either a Gandhäran or Mathurān model.28 Unfortunately the head is badly abraded, and earless with only a vague indication of a low nsņīsa.

Another version of a Buddha image in Sichuan may be found on bronze funerary 'money trees'. In one tomb near Mianyang north of Chengdu bronze 'tree' was found in the main chamber near the coffin.29 Along its vertical stalk are five small seated Buddha images 6.5 cm in height with a representation of Xiwangmu at its apex. (Fig. 4) Whether these represent the five Dhyäna Buddhas of Mahäyäna Buddhism is problematic; but their appearance with Xiwangmu recalls Kongwangshan, and the goddess' place- ment on her sacred mountain above the Buddhist imagery. The little Bud- dhas are almost identical with the drape between the hands forming a promi- nent 'U' shape and a face with a wide very flaring mustache. Buddha images of this type occur in early Gandhāran art, especially in the Baj aur region of Swat.30 In this style the usņīsa was treated as a large flat-topped bun of hair, 29 Ho Chih-kuo 1991, pp. 1-8; Wu Cho 1992, pp. 40-50; Rhie 1999, pp. 59-61, fig. i.3i.a.,b,c,d. Also of interest is a ceramic base of a money tree in the Nanjing Museum.

Other tiny Buddhas from 'money trees' have also turned up, probably from around the Later Han or third century, all seemingly follow- ing the same model. Indo-Scythians appear to have been active in Sichuan during the later Han era, bringing more than one type of Kusāņa Buddha image with them. How they managed to leave such a mark on local religious practices seems puz- zling, until one recalls that trade in luxuries for the West was the engine that also drove cultural connections with China. The little 'money tree' Buddhas appear to have had an origin early in Gandhāran imagery from Baj aur or Swat, with this model seemingly repeated over a fairly long period of time. The tomb lintel Buddhas are quite different perhaps having a later, more evolved Mathurān or Gandhāran origin within the Kusāņa Era. In some recently excavated tombs in Sichuan, small clay statuettes of fig- ures in trousers and pointed hats have been found, described as having non-</page><page sequence="10">10 6 MARTHA L.

Some Chinese archaeologists studying southwest China have come to the conclusion that wandering Inner Asian tribes filtered into the area from as early as 1000 BCE.32 Zhang Zenqi has presented evidence that Yunnan with the unusual 'animal style' art of its Dian culture, absorbed influences from the Inner Asian steppes.33 She suggests that when the Yuezhi displaced the Saka, some moved south in the late second and first century BCE to set- tle in Yunnan. If this is true, it would not be surprising to find that com- mercial relations between Indo-Scythians in India and their ethnic cousins Southwest China existed during the Later Han Era. Zhang Qian on his visit to Bactria discovered that the Yuezhi had already imported Sichuan goods from India.34 Subsequently, he endeavored on behalf of his emperor Wudi to find the southern trade route linking Sichuan to India, but without suc- cess.35 This was probably an impossible task, since at that time the Southwest had only a nominal Han presence, the natives were hostile and the terrain difficult. Saka tribes in Southwest China in the first century CE would very likely have known the routes to the southern sea by some variation of the 'Burma Roaď. The most probable itinerary would have run from Chengdu south to the Dian region, west to Dali and southwest to Mandalay on the Irrawaddy River, then to the Bay of Bengal.36 Another more arduous route might have gone west by land from Dali over several high mountain ranges to the upper Brahmaputra. At the Burmese terminus on the lower Irrawad- dy the trekkers could meet ships from India's coastal ports. Although these routes from China to India were clearly difficult, we know that some were in use at least from the second century BCE and probably earlier. Trade would have picked up substantially during an era of high prices and heavy demand for Sichuan silks. One interesting account by Pliny tells of an ambassadorial mission from Taprobane (Sri Lanka) that visited the Roman emperor Claudi- us.37 The father of one of these visiting officials was said to have gone on 31 Hong Kong University Newsletter, June 2004, pp. 1-3.

According to the Roman account, he was said to have met men on a riverbank within their country who were described as very tall, with fair hair and blue eyes, speaking in harsh unintelligible tones. Obvious- ly the ambassador's father did not trade with East Asians, but could easily have sailed northwest across the Bay of Bengal to meet with traders of Saka heritage on the banks of the Irrawaddy. Pliny also informs us that, accord- ing to information provided by the visitors, the coast of their island that ran southeast faced the land of the Seres, a geographical impossibility unless it was misunderstood as a location in Southeast Asia. It is noteworthy that the Saka elements may have persisted well into the period of the Wei Dynasty. A Buddhist Avalokitesvara stele dated to 548 CE shows along its base a band of eight foreign-looking male musicians and dancers wearing breeches and caps whose appearance is not dissimilar to that of enthusiastic Indo-Scyth- ian devotees portrayed similarly in Kusāņa Buddhist sculpture.38 Accounts of the Queen Mother of the West It is evident that Xiwangmu and the Buddha had a number of things in com- mon other than their Western origins. Wu Hung notes that '...during the Eastern Han the understanding of the Buddha was modified to fit that of Xi- wangmu while the image of Xiwangmu assumed the form of the Buddha'.39 Significantly, they seem to have had some sort of symbiotic relationship, each developing a cult following in China during the later Han, although the Queen Mother's cult must have started earlier reached far greater pop- ularity among the masses than nascent Buddhism. Anthropomorphic rep- resentations of the Buddha were not created in India before the early first century CE, while varied although relatively inconspicuous depictions of the Queen Mother are known from Chinese funerary art from the first cen- tury BCE. A glimpse of the actual power of her cult among common folk, however, lies in the sudden manifestation of a soteriological movement that must have evolved over time, culminating in a series of strange incidents of mass hysteria. Official accounts inform us that a severe drought occurred in the spring of three BCE.40 At that time masses of devotees of the Queen Mother marched on the Han capital declaring that she was coming to save them. These people carried 'manikins' of straw or hemp, exchanging these emblems with one another, and announcing that they were carrying out an advent procession of the goddess. Thousands crowded the roads creating much disorder and even set up relay stations to convey the Queen Mother's emblems. During the following summer her followers must have been cer- 38 Howard 1998, p. 119, pl. 1, p. 120.

They hand- ed out written messages declaring that those who wore her talisman would not die and warning unbelievers that they would not share in their salva- tion. In one version of these events we are told that it was predicted that 'straight eyeď folk were due to appear.41 It would not be overly speculative to suggest the possibility that, prior to the introduction of Buddhism, other foreign cults and images might have had some affect on Chinese popular re- ligion, especially after the Former Han Dynasty's opening of western land routes across Xinjiang. There can be not doubt that Xiwangmu must have played a significant role in folk religion in the period around the turn of the first millennium of the Common Era in China as a savior in troubled times, a bestower of blessings, and an aid to attaining paradise after death. As Loewe points out, her mythos evolved from popular beliefs and cults rather than the result of imposition by an authority from above.42 The evolution of her persona is unclear, since pre-Han texts describe her as ageless, remote from mankind, and frighten- ing in appearance. The earliest clear reference to the goddess found in the Zhuang-ęi (c.300 BCE), places her among the immortal beings who succeed- ed in attaining the Dao.43 In the text she sits isolated on a mythical western mountain, possibly in the western region of the sky. Among the fabulous creatures of the voluminous Shanhaijing, a pre-Han era section of the work portrays her as living far from humanity on Jade Mountain, semi-human in form, with a leopard's tail and teeth of a tiger.44 She is a skillful whistler, and in her disheveled hair wears a Victory crown' ( sheng ). She is described as being in charge of Catastrophes from the Sky and the Five Destructive Forces. Han era references to Xiwangmu in the same text places her north of the wastes of Kunlun where she dwells in a cave, seemingly a reference to a tomb.45 At this point she is also said to reign over a mountain paradise on Kunlun Mountain, the Han axis mundi and home of the gods.46 Interest- ingly, Cahill notes that in Han works within the Daoist cannon there are no records of any cult dedicated to her in spite of her obvious popularity, very possibly because of its low esteem among the Daoist intelligentsia.47 41 Loewe 1979, p. 150, fn. 62.

In a slightly different version by Strassberg (2002, pp. 109-110) she wears a sheng crown on top of her unkempt hair and administers 'calamities from heaven' as well as 'five punishments'. 45 Birrell 1999, p. 195; Strassberg 2002, p. 145. 46 For more information on Kunlun Mountain see Loewe 1979, pp. 110-112. 47 Cahill 1993, p. 32.</page><page sequence="13">[l3] CHINA AND THE MYSTERIOUS OCCIDENT IO9 Her connections with royalty are also revealing. In a tradition probably dating as far back as the Early Han era the Yellow Thearch, first ruler of China and first man to become immortal, are linked. When the Dao is lost the Thearch 'whistles and intones' and the Old Lady of the West breaks her sheng headdress.48 Cahill suggests that the dumbbell-shaped sheng headdress represents her loom, and when it breaks the fabric of the cosmos that she has created and maintains falls to pieces.49 Xun-zi (c. 250 BCE) founder of the Legalist school of Chinese philosophy relates that the heroic mythical emperor Yu, who saved the world from a universal flood in ancient times, studied with the Queen Mother.50 Cahill notes that as Yu's tutor she con- ferred both legitimacy and right to rule upon him.51 Another notable oc- currence is related in the Bamboo Annals , a text purportedly of the third cen- tury BCE but discovered in a late third century CE tomb. In this text the Queen Mother is said to have come to visit the Emperor Shun, Yu's prede- cessor; and in one version of the story gave him a ritual object with which he could regulate the seasons.52 The Bamboo Annals mentions that king Mu of the Zhou Dynasty visited the Queen Mother in 989 BCE in her Kunlun mountain paradise.53 That same year she visited his court. In later texts that expand on Mu and his visit to the mountain paradise, the goddess becomes more human, feasting, composing poetry, and even falling in love the king. A third century monograph gives us an account of a fable about the histori- cal emperor of the Former Han Dynasty Wudi, evidently an avid seeker of immortality. 54 His encounter with the goddess supposedly took place in a special pavilion he built for her visit. After sailing into his shrine on a purple chariot, she produced seven tiny magical peaches the size of cross-bow pel- lets. These she shared with the king giving him five to eat while she con- sumed the rest. When he saved the pits, the Queen Mother remarked that it would be useless to plant them since they bore fruit only once in three thousand years. Essentially, the implication is that Wudi could not become an immortal. This is the first time that the peach, later the Queen Mother s foremost emblem, is mentioned. It is also mentioned that the Queen mother and Wudi drank wine made from grapes.55 Grapes and grape wine produced in Inner Asia were first known during the reign of Wudi due to his contacts with Ferghana; yet until the Tang Era viticulture was unsuccessful and grape wine unpopular in China.56 In all wine-making regions of the West it was a beverage traditionally reserved for the aristocracy, and particularly at royal feasts. The allusion to wine from grapes is interesting here, linking the feast- ing ruler and goddess with a tradition of the exotic West. 48 Huainan zi 6.13a. 49 Cahill 1993, p. 44. 50 Xun ņ 19.3b.

The Iconography of Xiwangmu A ceiling painting from the tomb of Bu Qianqiu near Luoyang in Henan Province dated to the mid-first century BCE shows the goddess as a minor figure almost obscured by clouds wearing what looks like the dumbbell- shaped sheng on her head approached by an airborne male, probably Bu rid- ing a serpent below his wife riding a three-headed bird.57 (Fig. 5) The ma- jor figures in this cosmological panorama are a host of flying mythological creatures flanking lunar and solar symbols and the much larger human-ser- pent figures of Fuxi and Nuwa, mythical ancestors of mankind. The female Nuwa and the moon represent the primal principle of female yin, while the sun and Fuxi are male yang. An early example illustrated by Jean James is a pictorial brick from another Henan tomb showing an enigmatic scene with in an upper register, evidently the heavens, with the seated goddess before a suppliant.58 Still, she is not the focus of the scene, simply one of a cast of supernatural characters. Two other scenes of late Former Han date, also from Henan appear to give the Queen Mother a more prominent position. One shows her seated on a mountaintop with a prominent sheng headdress. 59 Around her are the animal members of her court, a nine-tailed fox, a hare with a mortar and pestle, and a bird that brings her food. A tall female fig- ure stands on the left side of the scene in a valley, and is tentatively identi- fied by Chinese scholars as the mythical mother of ten suns. Theoretically, this figure could be used to balance the hare, symbolic of the moon, thus centering the goddess between lunar and solar and yin and yang ; but this is unclear. The second pictorial brick, simpler and quite different in composi- tion, shows only Xiwangmu and her lunar hare.60 (Fig. 6) She is seated in a frontal more iconic pose, and the 'mountain' she sits on is a pedestal-like structure tapering inward from its base and outward at the top. The use of frontal poses for the goddess seen here anticipates that adopted for her im- agery in Sichuan and Shandong during the second century CE. Stone reliefs Fig. 5.

(After Wu Hung 1987, fig. 7 p. 28) ed that in Wu Hung's version of the Han Shu report on that disturbance, the devotees of the Queen Mother carry stalks of hemp rather than manikins made of hemp.69 Nonetheless it is an unusual detail. It is evident that the importance of the goddess changed dramatically from the first century BCE to the second century CE in Han funerary art in North and Central China Over that time she was transformed from one in a cast of helpful supernatural characters to a commanding figure and object of worship. Moreover, she acquired a royal mate of equal status whose yang theoretically balanced her formidable yin. Her throne or seat also changed from a simple mountain form to a high pedestal tapered toward the center, and often became a triple form. She also became involved in the lives of her worshippers, aiding them to escape ill fortune and bring worldly happi- ness and prosperity In essence her persona became that of a goddess who could aid her devotees to achieve their greatest desires in both this world and the next. If we turn to Sichuan in the far southwest, we find a very different imagery for the Queen Mother. As Wu Hung notes, Xiwangmu does not embody yin as seen elsewhere' and Dongwanggong is missing.70 Here the Queen Mother alone seems supreme, depicted at the center of the universe surrounded by the opposing forces that she commands. Her symbiotic relationship with the Buddha and Buddhist imagery suggest that they were seen by their devotees in similar ways, and that in some instances their cults intermingled. Never- 69 In Loewe's version (1979, p. 99) we find that '...the population were running around in a state of alarm, each person carrying a manikin of straw or hemp'. According to Wu Hung (1987, p. 29) each person was holding a stalk of hemp. 70 Wu Hung 1987, p. 26.</page><page sequence="18">114 MARTHA L. CARTER [l8] theless, the changes in Han era Xiwangmu iconography in Sichuan need not have been due solely to the introduction of Buddhism and the Buddha image from the West. Both are found in a funerary setting, but here we may note that this setting is most unusual for a Buddha image, but not for the Queen Mother. It would not be untoward to suggest that it was cult of the goddess that influenced the placement of Buddha images in such environments. In Sichuan her imagery may be found on Later Han bomb tiles and stone cof- fin ends. On tomb tile scenes she is clearly seen as the central figure seated on a mat under a canopy. (Fig. 9) Although she is not seated on a throne or mountain in the usual sense, she is enthroned on a double protome of a tiger on the left and a dragon on the right, reflecting not only West and East but also seemingly as theriomorphs of the goddess herself in triune form. On a typical tomb tile her bizarre attendants include a dancing toad and hare, both lunar symbols, a three-legged crow symbolic of the sun, the auspicious nine- tailed fox, an emaciated guard with a halberd, and three human worshippers in the foreground, one larger prostrate male and two smaller women.71 In one tomb tile from Pengshan her animals cavort wildly and play musical in- Fig. 9.

One par- ticularly interesting fragment of a bronze 'money tree' discussed by James shows the Queen Moth- er in more detail.73 The scene de- picted in a drawing of the flat cut-out metal surface shows the goddess on the pedestal-like mountain supporting what looks like a richly ornamented carpet with a wide border on which she is seated between her rampant ti- ger and dragon. (Fig. 10) In the drawing she wears a high head- dress with its ends splayed out on either side of her head. She wears a circular gem or decora- tion in the center of her brow, like the Buddha's urnā, and, as James notes, her gown closes on the left in the manner of western non-Chinese pastoralists. She in- terprets this to be an allusion to the fact that the goddess lives in the West beyond China. It is pos- sible that the left closing of the robe is also depicted on the Pengshan tile and on other examples from Sichuan as well. Inscribed on the pedestal moun- tain is a tree-like form above a flower or single stalk of grain. A ring around its base has parallel rippling lines to indicate that water flows around it like a moat. The hare and toad are shown on either side of the ring worshipping her. James concludes that in this instance the Queen Mother is quite appeal- ing with more delicate features than usual. She certainly does not have the large head and stern matronly visage of the tomb tiles, but here resembles a young woman of non-Chinese ethnicity. 72 Lim, pl. 62. 73 James 1995, p. 39, fig. 22.</page><page sequence="20">11 6 MARTHA L. CARTER [20] v. A Great Goddess of the West As the Chinese of the Han Era grew more knowledgeable about lands be- yond their borders Xiwangmu receded ever farther beyond the Western hori- zon. It was suggested that she might live in Tiaozhi (most probably Elymais and Susiana), which, as we shall see further on, seems prescient.74 That the Westerners had not heard of the Queen Mother of the West is not surpris- ing, although if questioned they might have replied that they were well ac- quainted of a great goddess whose name was Nana (also Nanaya or Nanaia). When the Yuezhi settled in northern Bactria they must have discovered that Nana was revered in the region, and later adopted her as a patron goddess of the illustrious Kusāņa Dynasty. Her name first appears on pre-Kusāņa sil- ver coin reverses Sapadbizes a minor ruler among the Yuezhi principalities in northern Afghanistan in the late first century BCE.75 (Fig. na) She is rep- resented by a standing lion below a crescent moon. Like Ishtar and Cybele, the lion is almost universally associated with her. On a silver disc found at the Bactrian Greek city of Aï Khanum on the Oxus, the goddess stands frontally in a chariot pulled across a plain by a pair of lions while a priest performs a ritual on a mountain top at the right.76 We know less about her than the Chinese Queen Mother, simply because of the lack of written records. Nev- ertheless, thanks to the newly discovered Rabatak Inscription of Kaniska I from northern Afghanistan, it is clearly stated that she was the primary de- ity involved in worship at the dynastic shrine he erected when be became ruler of the Kusāņa Empire c. 128-130 CE.77 On Kusāņa gold coin reverses she is one of the figures most frequently depicted, usually standing in profile, wearing a long gown and holding a wand with the protome of a leaping ani- mal resembling a leopard or lynx at its tip, seen here with the title Nanašao78 (Fig. 11b) There is a crescent on top of her head. She is also seen in a gown under a flared short tunic holding a bow while reaching over her right shoul- der for an arrow from a quiver.79 Nana is also shown seated on a lion on a gold reverse type of Huviska, holding her wand and a bowl or patera with a nimbus behind her and a crescent on her head.80 On a gold reverse type of Kaniska II also inscribed Nanašao , she appears on a lion seated en face hold- 74 Han shu 96 A. 28b; Shiji 123. 13; See Loewe 1979, pp. 95-96.

There is a triangle without a base, a vertical wedge shape below the crescent, a shape that also may appear in the center of Nana's upturned lunar crescent. This might possibly be the wedge symbol of the Mesopotamian deity Nabu with whom Nana was symbolically united in Sacred Marriage. 76 Bernard 1970, pp. 339-347, fig. 31.

Reverse drachm types of Agathocles and Pantaleon show Zeus holding a statuette of Hecate with two torches. 84 (Fig. nd) Although there is little direct evidence concerning the persona of the goddess Nana in pre- Kusāņa times during the Bactrian-Greek and Indo-Greek eras, it seems clear that Bactrian deities already popular in earlier times were adapted to their closest Greek counterparts in the process of theocrasia, utilized throughout the Hellenistic world. Thus the Greek Artemis and Hecate can be consid- ered as possible stand-ins for the native Nana. After the Greek kingdom of Bactria fell in the mid-second century BCE, the Yuezhi inherited a number of Hellenized versions of Bactrian deities, including Nana, and took her on particularly as a royal deity, granting legitimacy to the Kusāņa dynasty from the period of Kaniska I. The power of the goddess as a dynastic patroness is indicated by her title on coin reverses as Saonanã or Nanãsao.85 A copper reverse of Huviska shows a diademed male kneeling before her.86 Nana or Nanaia in Greek form was known in Seleucid Iran as well as Bac- tria, and most certainly was well-established before their arrival. Her tem- ple at Susa was ransacked by a Macedonian officer in 325 BCE who was later punished by Alexander.87 When Susa became Hellenized as Seleucia-on-Eu- laios one series of the local coinage shows a lion reverse.88 When the Seleu- cid ruler Antiochus IV stopped in Elam at the temple of Nanaia in 165 BCE he was said to have desired to confiscate the temple treasure, but the official political reason for the visit to perform a ritual Micros gamos between the rul- er and the goddess. When he died shortly afterward a story circulated that he was struck down by the goddess for his transgressions.89 Twenty-five years later the same temple was looted by Parthian ruler Mithridates I as a punishment for its citizens support the Seleucid Demetrios II. A temple at Dura-Europos was dedicated to Artemis- Nanaia as the city's patron god- dess.90 Clearly Nanaia had a following in both Seleucid and Parthian Iran, with her most famous temple located at Susa. Recently Daniel Potts has pos- tulated convincingly that the Bactrian Nana is the descendent of an ancient Mesopotamian goddess named Nanaya who is distinct from either Inanna or Ishtar.91 He suggests that her cult migrated to the East on trade routes that had established her in the BMAC (Bactro-Margian) Bronze Age culture be- 84 Ibid., for Agathocles' silver tetradrachm reverse see p. 172 , pl. 7, for Pantaleon see p. 181, pl. 9. 85 Rosenfield 1967, pp. 90-91, pl. vii nos. 145-147. 86 Mukhertee 1969, P. 117, pl. ix, 36. 87 Arrian anabasis vi. 27. 3-5.

Her original Mesopotamian cult appears to have been popular in Uruk during the late third millennium BCE. The Neo-Assyrian king Assurbanipal (669-633 BCE) returned a stat- ue of Nanaya from Susa which was recorded to have been stolen by an ear- ly Elamite king. The date of this act is controversial, but Potts suggests that, if we take Assurbanipal at his word, the statue's theft and placement in Susa would have been between 2182 and 2477 BCE.92 Much later a statue of her was carried off again by Elamites and returned to Uruk by the Neo-Assyrian king Essarhaddon (680-669 BCE)93 It would seem that the Elamites, who had trading and perhaps other connections with the BMAC culture of Bactria and Northeastern Iran, developed a particular fondness for the goddess and her Mesopotamian images at an early period. During the Seleucid and Parthian eras a yearly festival in her honor was celebrated in Uruk featuring costumed actors wearing masks, music and a banquet.94 Two hymns offered by kings of the Old Babylonian Period dedi- cated to Nanaya are extant, and it is known that in the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Periods sacred marriage rites were carried out yearly at her temple in Uruk.95 An interesting detail in Mesopotamian literature of the Old Babylonian Era occurs in a hymn mentioning Nana as bestowing her lion scepter on a king who is described as her beloved.96 It is not impossible, as Potts notes, that the 'lion scepter' of Nanaya in second millennium BCE Mesopotamia was transmitted down through the ages to become that of the Hellenized Nanaia or Bactrian Nana of the Kusāņa Era.97 Her Mesopota- mian persona at Uruk, has been thoroughly investigated through ancient in- scriptions and texts by Westenholz, who describes the goddess as nurturing, erotic, wealth-giving, especially in regard to kings whom she endows with life, progeny, and sensuality.98 In her large temple, the Emeurur at Uruk there were statues of living and dead kings and also in another temple dedicated to her at Larsa statues of deceased kings received gifts.99 There are many ref- erences to her with lunar associations, but also some that are solar, but she was never closely associated with the moon until a very late period. Kings are blessed by sacred unions with her. She also seems to have had a particularly strong cult among royal women and daughters of kings.100 Her name may have been derived originally from an Elamite word for 'day' in the sense of a twenty-four hour period of time.101 In a hymn dedicated to Nanaya from the reign of Sargon II (721-705 BCE) she is addressed as 'Queen Nanay', and 92 Ibid., pp. 29-30. 93 Westenholz 1997, pp. 74-75. 94 Ibid. pp. 76-77.

She is wrapped in a heavy robe wears a feathered crown and sits on a raised throne with lion legs.104 (Fig. 12) Over her are the three celestial symbols of the sun (Shamash) the moon (Sin) and the star of Ishtar. It is signifi- cant to note that the same sym- bols appear in the sky on the sil- ver disc found at Greek-Bactrian Aï Khanum. Many representations of god- desses occur on compartmented bronze stamp seals BMAC seals c. 2000 BCE. Sarianidi states that they de- pict anthropomorphic winged personages seated on or standing with felines, presumably lions.105 He also notes that since there no lions existed in Bac- tria the motif must have come from Mesopotamian glyptics. The figure on the seals is identified by Potts as Nanaya /Nana whose cult was handed down from the BMAC culture in Bactria where the goddess often shown seated on a leonine beast.106 It is significant to note, however, that the BMAC ve- hicle of the goddess is often a lion-dragon with horns, a short beard and of- ten with wings. 107(Fig. 13) This demonic creature, resembling a lion griffon, appears to have been a creation of local imagination, not a borrowing from Elam or Mesopotamia. If her cult arrived in the Bactro-Margian region in the late third millennium BCE as Potts suggests, her powerful persona had two millennia to develop and flourish within the native population.

The creature is an unusual hybrid since the iront of the animal is scaled and dragon-like while the rear appears to be feline. The typical Mesopotamian creature is a lion/bird-of- prey or lion-griffin with the front part a winged lion and the hind part avian. It may have had some connection to storms as a weather-beast in Mesopotamia.</page><page sequence="25">[25] CHINA AND THE MYSTERIOUS OCCIDENT 121 Fig. 13.

Sarianidi has suggested that gold belt plaques from Burial Four of the Tillya-Tepe Treasure dating from the early first century CE Bactria repeat a strongly Hellenistic version of Na- naia/Nanā lounging on the back of a lion.108 Here she looks much like Ar- temis in hunting costume with her hair pinned up, wearing a short skirt and greaves. Another gold plaque inlaid with turquoise from the same treasure shows the figure of a female in a long robe with a mural crown standing en face holding a pair of rampant dragons.109 (Fig. 14) This could easily be the same goddess depicted in a hieratic Sarmatian style. Perhaps significantly, the goddess is shown with slanted eyes. This brings up an interesting and little documented facet Nana in small terracotta statuettes from Bactria datable from the first through third century CE studied by Abdullaev.110 These in- variably show an enthroned goddess, some having faces with a pronounced Mongoloid cast, long straight hair, and a high headdress or mound of hair tied with a fillet. Several show a crescent on the forehead and others have a headdress with crescent ornaments. This brings up the important fact that the Yeuzhi who crossed to Bactria from China's borders were a confedera- tion of people with heterogeneous ethnic backgrounds, some Europoid and 108 Sarianidi 1985, pp. 38-39, figs. 88-97.

(after Abdullaev, 2003, fig. 13) some likely East Asian. At Tillya Tepe other East Asian elements have been found in its gold funerary ornaments, and most significantly a Former Han dynasty Chinese mirror.111 The Yuezhi tribes knew China well before mak- ing their hasty flight to avoid hostile Xiongnu forces. If some had previously heard of the Queen Mother of the West while wandering about on China's western borderlands they might have assumed that they had found her when they reached Bactria. Contemporary Parthian imagery of Nanaia is extremely varied from Hel- lenizing to local. On coins from Susa issued in 110 BCE she is as a goddess of both sun and moon with a rayed head, like that of the Diodotus coins.112 In a graffito found on a jar excavated as Assur she is shown in local style as a figure wearing a voluminous celestial robe covered with stars and crescents standing on a platform decorated with a row of plants within an arcade.113 (Fig. 15) The headdress she wears is made up of a solar rosette with a cres- cent under it supported by a flat base with large rounded ends each deco- rated with a dot. At Palmyra she appears with bow and arrows and on sev- eral tesserae.114 Terracotta statuettes of female figures crowned with cres- cents found within the Parthian Empire have been identified as Nanaya/ Nanaia.115 Her cosmic sway is still recognizable in post-Kusāņa Central Asia 111 Sarianidi, 1985, fig. 145. 112 Westenholz, 1997, pp. 79-80. 113 Andrae and Lenzen, 1933, pp. 109-111, fig. 46; Westenholz, p. 80, fig. 2. 114 Ingholt 1955, nos. 285,286, and 310. 115 Cumont 1926, p. 199, and fn. 2.</page><page sequence="27">[27] CHINA AND THE MYSTERIOUS OCCIDENT 123 where she is shown in medallion of a seventh century silver bowls from Choresmia as a four-armed goddess seated on a lion wearing a mural crown with a crescent on it holding patera and scepter in her lower hands and a sun and moon the upper ones.116 (Fig. i 6) The same goddess rides a dragon on another bowl.117 Thus both lion and dragon appear to have been retained as her vehicles in these instances. In essence we may characterize the ancient Bactrian goddess Nana by her attributes of the lion, lu- nar crescent, and distinctive scep- ter. Her lunar crescent may have been added at a rather late date, possibly due to the Greek associa- tion with Artemis. If her cult mi- grated to Bactria from Elam dur- ing the Bronze Age BMAC era, it is possible there was a more an- cient deity in that region whose persona was absorbed into that of the Mesopotamian goddess. In early Mesopotamia Nanaya had her own tem- ples and images distinct from those of Inanna or Ishtar, and was portrayed in texts as the goddess beloved of kings, blessing them life, fertility, and prosper- ity, also having a special devotion from ladies of the royal house. She is also a goddess associated with both the sun and moon with her name in Elamite possibly derived from time itself in the diurnal /nocturnal cycle of 'day'. Her character is sensual, erotic, and quintessentially feminine. In Bronze Age Bactria, however, it is possible that she combined with a more sinister deity who is depicted sitting on a lion-dragon monster. Her Mesopotamian attri- bute as divine consort and bestower of sovereignty on kings appears to have filtered down over two millennia to the Kusāņa Dynasty in Bactria. Inter- estingly enough, the Mesopotamian references to Nanā's temple as a place where the statues of living and dead kings were placed echo the character- Fig. 15.

Conclusion If we compare the Han Dynas- ty goddess Xiwangmu and her contemporary Nana / Nanaia in the Parthian/ Indo-Scythian world, we will discover a great many shared attributes. First, both are quintessential yin , with a distinct aura of eroticism about them, and have natures that can be dangerous or nurturing depend- ing on the circumstances. Both are strongly connected with the royal legiti- macy and well-being of rulers with whom they may perform ritual unions. Nanaya in Mesopotamia and Iran appears to have been involved in varied forms of sacred marriage. Xiwangmu in China performed a similar func- tion. Here the reception of royalty to the goddess' paradise takes place in a mythical past, however, and ultimately results in the creation of the King Father of the East whose conjugal visits were meant to keep the cosmic yin and yang in balance. In their darker personae the goddesses echo the Hindu Durgā and Artemis /Hecate, since they are all-powerful, self-sufficient, and have no male deity as spouse. Xiwangmu begins here career in the Classic of Mountains and Seas as a forbidding combination of female and tiger living alone and far from human habitation. The two symbolic animals depicted emerging from either side of her seat are a tiger and a dragon. The BMAC goddess sits on a strange leonine monster that is also a dragon, and Nana/ Nanaia has a lion vehicle and is symbolized by a lion. In Han China the ti- ger and dragon are directional animals, affirming in a sense her power as a goddess of cosmic sway, but also they may be seen as theriomorphic incar- nations of the goddess herself. Xiwangmu lives on a mountain peak. Umā- Pārvatī and Durgā are associated with mountains, and it would not be sur- prising to find that the Bactrian Nana at home on a peak in the Hindu Kush 118 Rosenfield, 1967, pp. 139-172.</page><page sequence="29">[29] CHINA AND THE MYSTERIOUS OCCIDENT 125 or Pamirs. The mythical ancient Indian axis mundi is Meru, mountain of the gods, which supposedly developed an hour-glass shape due to its having been used as the churning stick for the creation of the universe in the primordial Ocean of Milk with the serpent Vasuki wrapped around its middle as the rope pulled back and forth by gods and demons. Polyaenus, a Macedonian military writer of the second century CE records that Meros (Meru), sacred to Dionysos, was a three-peaked mountain.119 We may note that Mt. Kun- lun in Han imagery seems to have evolved into a similarly inwardly tapered shape and triple form. Xiwangmu's image is exclusively from tomb settings mainly because she was a deity who could assist her devotees in achieving a paradisical afterlife. The little clay figurines of the goddess Nana in Bactria and Sogdiana appear in tomb contexts as well, and suggest that she was con- sidered to be a deity whose influence reached beyond the grave. In Kusāņa iconography Nana wears a lunar crescent but is not a moon god- dess. This is made abundantly clear by the presence in the coin pantheon of the male moon god Mao. In the Parthian graffito she wears a mantle of stars and crescents with a sun and moon headdress, all clearly indicating her celes- tial dimension. In later pre-Islamic Sogdian and Choresmian imagery Nana holds the sun and moon in her upper hands in another allusion to her celes- tial powers. Even in her earliest appearances in Chinese literature the Queen Mother appears to have been described as a controller of constellations. So- lar and lunar allusions may be found in the animals and birds that surround her in her mountain paradise. In Sichuan particularly, she is at the center of the cosmos with the sun and moon birds as figures on either side. Clearly, there are enough correspondences between the personae of Xi- wanmgu and Nana to warrant the possibility that they may be linked in some manner. In Kongwangshan near the northern Chinese coast and in Sichuan images of the Buddha and Queen Mother are found together, and even look alike. This would not be surprising, if among the Indo-Scythians who came to China in the first two centuries of the Common Era there were some who were Buddhists, and some who were familiar with the cult of the Great Goddess of Bactria. In such instances the two goddesses might have been considered to have had interchangeable identities. The use of symbolic lan- guage to define the attributes of Xiwangmu is totally Chinese, especially in the solar/lunar animals such as the crow, toad, hare, and birds that surround her, but their meaning is not much different from the more literal symbols of Western Asia that surround Nana. The point of this analysis, however, is not to claim that the two goddess- es were originally one, although this is not beyond the realm of possibility. If we may postulate the presence of Nana in Bactria and Margiana from as early as the late third millennium BCE, as Daniel Potts suggests, some 119 Polyaenus, strategica, I. i. 1-3. See Majumdar, i960, p. 456.</page><page sequence="30">126 MARTHA L. CARTER [30] knowledge of her might have filtered across Xinjiang this very early period, coloring the creation of an archaic ancestress of Xiwangmu in the Chinese mind. She might have stayed an obscure figure of folklore if China had not opened land trade routes to the West during the first century BCE, a peri- od when the Arsacid Empire in Iran became its chief trading partner. The Yuezhi, after their conquest of Bactria in the late second century BCE, must have quickly discovered the value of their strategic location as the middle- man for trade between China and Western Asia, and had the advantage of having a familiarity with Chinese culture, since they had left its borders only a few decades before. Neither the Parthian traders with China nor the Yuezhi were likely to have been active prosely tizers for Buddhism at this time, but could easily have provided accounts of a Great Goddess of the West who brought salvation to her worshippers. This might help explain the phenom- enon of the great peasant uprising of three BCE in China, when a supposed- ly minor supernatural figure suddenly became a savior of the masses whose advent was predicted as imminent. Her unofficial cult among the common people is likely to have evolved to a large extent through increased contacts with Westerners during the previous century This hypothesis is not meant to suggest that Chinese Queen Mother became Nana in disguise, only that knowledge among the masses that a great goddess of the West really exist- ed, and information about her vast powers must have been an impetus for Xiwangmu's sudden prominence and affected her persona. After the disasters that weakened Han Dynasty at the turn of the first cen- tury of the Common Era, trade by land became more difficult due to China's loss of protection of the trade routes of Xinjiang. At that very same time the newly created Roman Empire of the Augustan age, flush with recently acquired wealth saw a vastly increased demand for silk cloth and yarn. Using the sea trade from Red Sea ports commercial relations with India increased dramatically as an alternative to land trade. As noted above, it seems like- ly that Saka kingdoms under Indo-Parthian control maintained flourishing coastal ports from which Chinese silks were sent to the West. By the mid- dle decades of the first century foreign Buddhists had outposts on China's northern coast near rich silk producing areas of Shandong. Although the rock carvings of Kongwangshan cannot be specifically dated, they seem to be among the earliest known examples of Buddhist art in China. The for- eigners depicted there appear to be Indo-Scythians, among whom there were likely to have been a considerable number of recent converts to Buddhism. At Kongwangshan the rock face of the hill was transformed into Kunlun Mountain with the Queen Mother at its apex above the Buddhist imagery in a prime example of the melding of the two ideologies. In Sichuan during the Later Han Era Xiwangmu's imagery is also intimately connected with Buddha figures in a process that must have involved land and sea trade with Indian ports, most probably via Burma and the Bay of Bengal. Here again</page><page sequence="31">[3l] CHINA AND THE MYSTERIOUS OCCIDENT 127 the influence of Indo-Scythian or Saka traders may have initiated the blend- ing of the two ideologies. Influences along the trade routes can run in both directions. We have not- ed that during the period of Yuezhi (later the Kusāņa Dynasty) rule in Bac- tria some renditions of the goddess Nana appear show unusual traits. The figure of the goddess from the Tillya Tepe Treasure and numerous terracot- ta statuettes are given faces with a Mongoloid cast. As an explanation Ab- dullaev reminds us that there were East Asian ethnic elements in the Yuezhi confederation. Nevertheless, an East Asian looking Nana could also be seen as echo of the Chinese Xiwangmu. Bibliography Abdullaev, K. 2003. 'Nana in Bactrian Arť, Silk Road Art and Archaeology.
