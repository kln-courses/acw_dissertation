PISMO CLAM* This department features regular competitions. Any number of entries may be submitted, but each must be 250 words or less, and none can be returned. One prize of $10.00, and $3.00 prizes for addi- tional published entries, will be awarded. RESULTS OF COMPETITION No. 1 Competitors were asked to review certain "unreal- ized" films in the style of a well-known critic or magazine. First prize goes to Noilly Prat, whose imitation of Variety seems closest to the original. I especially liked his "DEATH is a natural for exploitation here ..." Threnody Cooper's Tyler vs. Bresson fell further from the mark, but its grandly swelling period was deemed worthy of inclusion. I sadly missed reference to Robert Flaherty in Mr. Harker's Museum of Modern Art note, yet his "In- cidentally providing a glimpse . . ." is a model of perverse sentence structure, and undoubtedly vin- tage MMA. VARIETY, Paris, Nov. 30 H. G. Clouzot, of DIABOLIC renown, has sent grosses soaring at the Atelier Lyrique with a new three hour Cinemascope shocker, DEATH ON THE INSTALMENT PLAN (MORT A CREDIT). Pic shapes as bonanza for this small (482) nabe, first frame chalking up record-breaking 900,000 francs. Based on Celine's Depression days novels JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE NIGHT and DEATH ON THE INSTALMENT PLAN, flick tells sordid story of author's adolescence and ca- reer in Cameroons and U.S. Director spoke open- ing nite to jammed house, urging "greater freedom in a new political climate," had some Americans here concerned over alleged Red tinge to reels de- picting hero's adventures in World War I and brief term at Ford plant. DEATH is a natural for ex- ploitation here, but dubbing and heavy shearing would improve U.S. artie prospects, with shapely Simone Signoret and heavy Yves Montand plus factors. Algerian street-fighting limited attendance Sunday (29) but rave reviews in key mags are packing them in, with S.R.O. sign diplayed today. Direction excellent, lensing so-so. -NOILLY PRAT Although in choosing to symbolize the deep re- jection of society and its demands that Thoreau's book demanded, M. Bresson has employed his char- acteristic strategy of merging real and phantasmic actions, attempting to produce a species of sur- realism al fresco, through the use of a nonactor, an unknown New England farmer, and exploiting his uncanny natural skill at handling bean seeds (around which, as a kind of grail, the entire center sequence of the film is ponderously but meticulously constructed) while keeping always in view, at a level just shading below the conscious, Thoreau's fundamental phobia for human relationships, dis- guised as it so skillfully was under resistances im- pervious to the ordinary inquiring reader's mind; nonetheless we may still wonder if he has been en- tirely successful in preserving the profound emo- tional contact which Thoreau was able, perhaps unwitting of his real techniques, to build up in the reader-or, for that matter, whether in following the structure of Walden so strictly, and refusing tout court to introduce any alleviating plot elements, he has not turned the cinema inside out, as it were, and made it a mere appendage of literature. -THRENODY COOPER THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. Originally a cameraman, David Lean turned to direction as early as 1942, when he co-directed In Which We Serve (1942). More recently, he has specialized in literate, if not especially cinematic, adaptations drawn from classic English novels. His Hound of the Baskervilles (1958), shown here by kind per- mission of its American owners Product Pictures, captures an ambiance of solipsistic dread unparal- leled since the wunderkind days of Orson Welles (Citizen Kane, 1941; The Magnificent Ambersons, 1944), eschewing though it does the more taxing * Mr. Clam is a director well known from his non- performance of that role in The Bank Dick.</page><page sequence="2">63 character complexities of this late Victorian set- piece. John Gielgud's Holmes, inscrutable master of needle and slipper, and his eminence grise Dr. Wat- son (admirably delineated by Sir Ralph Richard- son) serve as perfect foils for the masterful Moriarty and Mrs. Hudson of Orson Welles and Brenda de Banzie. If the hound at times exhibits that lament- able anthropomorphism characteristic of the late Rin Tin Tin, he still fills his brief, deadly function almost beyond cavil. Incidentally providing a glimpse of another notable English director, Sir Carol Reed appears briefly as the country doctor of the first scene. While one must reserve the highest measure of praise from a film patently dedicated to the cele- bration of a world long since forgotten, The Hound yet commands our attention for the high gloss and polish which Mr. Lean brings to his camerawork, forcing us to wish once more that this able director would turn his hand to those contemporary themes with which his colleagues-most notably Paul Rotha -have so long and fruitfully been engaged.-JoNA- THAN HARKER COMPETITION NO. 2 Entries should be addressed to: "Film Quartered," University of California Press, Berkeley 4, Califor- nia. Deadline: January 15, 1959. Prizes will be announced in the Spring issue. A Los Angeles psychiatrist was recently quoted (out of context) as saying that horror films such as I Was a Teen-Age Werewolf and Blood of Dracula con- stitute a form of "self-administered psychiatric therapy for America's adolescents." Submit a title, with brief synopsis, for a similar film of equal or greater psychotherapeutic value to the nation's teen-agers.</page></plain_text>
