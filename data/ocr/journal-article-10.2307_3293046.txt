<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pietas Epicurea William H. FitzGerald, S.J. Apart from the intrinsic merit of this paper, it is impressive (though not surprising to one who knows the order) that a defense of the sincerity of Epicurus' religion should come from such a source. G. F. Else and I have printed independent opinions that Lucretius 3.14-30 constitutes the poet's account of his experience of conversion. Father FitzGerald is at Weston College, Mass. N O OTHER SCHOOL of Greek philosophy has found among Christians fewer sym- pathetic students than that of Epicurus. The adjective "epicurean" has become a synonym for gross hedonism; it is commonly used in no other than this pejorative sense. With the notion of a contemptible sensualism there is closely allied, in the popular concept of Epi- cureanism, the accusation of atheism. Refer- ences to the gods and to man's obligation in their regard found in the writings of Epicurus or Lucretius the casual reader ascribes to hypocrisy or passes over as a mere device to deceive the multitude and protect the school from the storm of indignation which the knowledge of its true doctrine would sup- posedly have aroused. There is no denying the fact that many professed disciples of Epicurus, and especially the Roman Epicureans, who were for the most part interested only in the ethical doctrine of the school, brought the Philosophy of the Garden to disrepute and deserved, by their scandalous lives, the odium attached to the word "epicure." But such defections from the Epicurean ideal of the harmonious balance of pleasures the Master himself would have been the first to censure. Epicurus, like many an- other, was not always blessed in his disciples and, in his case at least, the sins of the pupils have, all too successfully, been laid upon the teacher. Our present concern, however, is not with the supposed hedonism of Epicurus but with the charge that he was an atheist, and, more specifically, with his concept of the virtue of piety. Tradition to the contrary, neither Epi- curus nor his authentic disciples, among whom Lucretius is facile princeps, denied the existence of gods. It is true that the undis- guised contempt manifested by the Epi- cureans both for the popular anthropomorphic religions (which they despised as a mass of superstitions) and the more refined astral re- ligion (which Epicurus loathed as a breeder of despair) gave a ready handle to those who would accuse the school of atheism. It is true, moreover, that the Epicurean Theology was too esoteric to fill the religious vacuum which its crusade against current beliefs was bound to create in the popular mind. The Epi- cureans, nevertheless, did have a positive theology and a concept of pietas as sincere as it was unique. It seems worthwhile to pre- sent, in the interest of truth, some of the evidence on which the charge of atheism rests and the facts by which it is refuted. For the traditional concept of Epicurean- ism Cicero is, in no small measure, responsi- ble. He was, in fact, formulating the common opinion of posterity when he wrote in De Natura Deorum concerning the Epicurean attitude toward the gods: Sunt enim philosophi et fuerunt qui omnino nullam habere censerent rerum humanarum procurationem deos. quorum si vera sententia est, quae potest esse pietas quae sanctitas quae religio? haec enim omnia pure atque caste tribuenda deorum numini ita sunt, si animad' vertuntur ab is et si est aliquid a deis immortalibus hominum generi tributum; sin autem dei neque possunt nos iuvare nec volunt nec omnino curant nec quid agamus animadvertunt nec est quod ab is ad hominum vitam permanare possit, quid est quod ullos deis im- mortalibus cultus honores preces adhibeamus? in specie '95 </page><page sequence="2">WILLIAM H. FITZGERALD autem fictae simulationis sicut reliquae virtutes item pietas inesse non potest; cum qua simul sanctitatem et religionem tolli necesse est, quibus sublatis perturbatio vitae sequitur et magna confusio.1 Cicero saw in Epicureanism a threat to the very foundation of the social order; for, by denying the possibility of divine intervention in the affairs of men, it was undermining the basis of reverence for the gods and, in conse- quence, respect for domestic and public or- der and the very virtue of justice which was the corner-stone of civil institutions. . . . haut scio an pietate adversus deos sublata fides etiam et societas generis humani et una excellentissuma virtus justitia tollatur.2 That Epicurus himself was an atheist neither in theory nor in practice Cicero was, of course, well aware; but he saw clearly enough that his concept of man's relation to the gods was too nebulous to counteract the danger inherent in his attack on the tradi- tional religio. Cicero believed no more in the crudities of the popular anthropomorphic re- ligion than did the Epicureans, but he was profoundly convinced of its practical value as a bulwark of public order and the status quo. From this point of view, his strictures on the Philosophy of the Garden are both under- standable and correct. One has but to read Lucretius, as Cicero himself amost certainly did, to realize that the practical consequences of Epicureanism, which was much the vogue throughout Italy at the time, especially among the upper ranks of society, might well be re- ligious anarchy and social disintegration. It is not surprising, therefore, that, despite his cordial relationships with many Epicure- ans and their sympathizers, he showed for their opinions an hostility bordering on con- tempt. His criticism, in consequence, is not always to be accepted without reservation, nor is he an altogether unimpeachable witness to the true doctrine of Epicurus. Unfor- tunately his suspicions about the sincerity of the Epicurean Theology have been generally accepted without investigation. Cicero's dis- cussion of the doctrine of Epicurus in the First Book De Natura Deorum is hastily done and incomplete. This is not to imply that the author is consciously unfair, but he would scarcely have been human had he not shown some impatience in explaining a system of thought for which he had so little sympathy. More than half of Book I is devoted to a criti- cism and refutation of the Epicurean position made by Cotta, a follower of the New Acad- emy. Of the space allotted to Velleius, the Epicurean spokesman, about half is taken up with a polemic directed at Plato and the Stoics and an unintelligent, careless review of the teaching of philosophers from Tbales to Diogenes of Seleucia. The polemic is super- ficial and does less than justice to the opinions it discusses; the historical review, however accurate it may be as an example of the Epi- curean mode of argumentation, has been ex- panded out of all proportion. To the positive exposition of the doctrine of Epicurus Cicero devotes a little less than fourteen numbers out of a total of one hundred and twenty-four. Mayor has correctly observed: The Epicurean exposition ... is far superior to the his- torical section, but it suffers from curtailments, just where full explanation was most needed. Unhappily Cicero had not time to think out a difficulty; so when he comes to one, he either omits, or satisfies himself with a rendering which is unintelligible to himself as well as to every one else ....3 There is good reason, accordingly, to suspect that what Cicero says of the theology of Epicurus is not the whole truth; at best he is a prejudiced witness. It is possible, however, to check Cicero's statements to some extent and to indicate, at least in outline, the nature of Epicurean religious practice from hints found in the writings of Epicurus and the poem of Lucretius. The speculative side of Epicurean Theology-its arguments for the existence of gods, its explanation of their atomic structure, and its description of their life in the intermundane spaces to which their activity, if activity it may be called, was confined-is a study too vast to be encompassed within the limits of a brief paper. It is possible, however, to demon- strate that authentic Epicureans professed a piety which was by no means mere hypoc- risy. The gods of Epicurus are deities sui generis, not only in their nature and mode of existence, I96</page><page sequence="3">PIETAS EPICUREA but, above all, in their relationship to the uni- verse and to man. It is a cardinal principle of Epicureanism, enunciated in the first of the Golden Sayings of Epicurus, and repeated by Lucretius, that the gods have absolutely no concern with the government of the world and the affairs of men. To make petition to them is useless, for they neither listen to nor are moved by human supplication. Indeed, prayer is worse than useless, for the convic- tion that the gods somehow control the des- tiny of man is, according to Epicurus, the foundation of the whole apparatus of super- stitition which has enslaved mankind. The doctrine of providence and of survival after death is the double chain which binds the race of men in abject servitude at the feet of the hideous gods of the anthropomorphic pan- theon. The express purpose of Lucretius' poem, in fact, is to free mankind from the ter- rors of supersitition and of the fear of death by explaining the true nature of things, by proclaiming the basic doctrines of the mor- tality of the soul and divine non-interference in the world. It is this evangel which is the starting point and the culmination of the whole Epicurean system as it is propounded by Lucretius. Indeed, it seems true to say that, even in the case of Epicurus himself, the physics, the canonic and the ethics, as well as the theology, are an elaborate rationaliza- tion of the conviction that the death of the gods of tradition is the indispensable condi- tion of human happiness. The violence of the Epicurean attack on contemporary religion can be explained, in part at least, by the fact that both Epicurus and Lucretius, men of keen intelligence and extraordinary sensitivity of soul, knew it and loathed it for the contemptible thing it was. The character of Lucretius, limned in every line of his poem, was that of a man consumed with a passion for truth, highly introspective, tortured with doubts about the future, terri- fied by the specter of despair which loomed behind the implacable statues of the gods. If Epicurus succeeded in freeing some at least from a religion of fear, he did so at the risk of denying the possibility of a practical religion of any kind. A theology of gods re- siding in the remote spaces of the intermundia which were the Epicurean heaven, absorbed completely in the enjoyment of their own beatitude, incapable of hearing or answering the prayers of mankind, has no place for peti- tion and sacrifice. To the pagan Roman mind, with its legalistic concept of religion, such a theology was unintelligible.4 Yet Lucretius explicitly denies that piety involves sacrifice: nec pietas ullast velatum saepe videri vertier ad lapidem atque omnis accedere ad aras nec procumbere humi prostratum et pandere palmas ante deum delubra nec aras sanguine multo spargere quadrupedum nec votis nectere vota....5 A religion of sacrifice, he asserts, is capable of heinous crimes; it has inspired sinful and unholy deeds such as human sacrifice.6 Lucre- tius ends his description of the tragic immola- tion of Iphigenia with the bitter indictment: tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.7 Taken at its face value, such a statement seems to inspire the charge, repeatedly made by Cotta in his reply to Velleius in De Natura Deorum, that Epicurus has destroyed the rational basis of all religion.8 Yet Epicurus not only believed in gods, but regarded them with reverence.9 He even wrote on the subject of piety,O1 though his books are now lost to us. It is not surprising to find this professed reverence for the gods set down to hypocrisy, even before Cicero's time; for the charge was a common calumny hurled by one philosophical school against an- other." The accusation is made by Cotta: Ludimur ab homine non tam faceto quam ad scribendi licentiam libero. quae enim potest esse sanctitas si dii humana non curant, quae autem animans natura nihil curans? Verius est igitur nimirum illud quod familiaris omnium nostrum Posidonius disseruit in libro quinto de natura deorum nullos esse deos Epicuro videri, quaequae is de deis immortalibus dixerit invidiae detestandae gratia dixisse .... Epicurus re tollit oratione relinquit deos ....12 This insinuation is baseless. As Guyau has pointed out, referring to this very passage, the time had long passed when one need fear openly to doubt the existence of the gods.'3 According to Festugiere, a recent and emi- I97</page><page sequence="4">WILLIAM H. FITZGERALD nently competent critic, Epicurus belongs, not with the sceptics of the latter half of the Fourth Century, but with those who were then reacting against the ever increasing dis- belief.14 Epicurus himself says that " ... the impious man is not he who denies the gods of the many, but he who attaches to the gods the beliefs of the many."15 He claimed that, though he had destroyed the doctrine of providence, he had left a place for piety.16 It is much. more difficult to discover just what this pietas was than to determine what it was not. Bailey recognizes three more or less distinct aspects-contemplation, imitation and communion.17 The Epicurean religion ap- parently included the notion of an untroubled contemplation of the universe. Lucretius, re- jecting the traditional concept, asserts that, true piety is rather . . . pacata posse omnia mente tueri.18 The exalted nature of the gods is, according to Velleius, a natural object of man's contemplation and reverence: ... nam et praestans deorum natura hominum pietate coleretur, cum et aeterna esset et beatissima (habet enim venerationem iustam quicquid excellit) ....19 Cotta quotes the Epicurean opinion: "At est eorum [deorum] eximia quaedam praestansque natura, ut ea debeat ipsa per se colendam elicere sapi- entem."20 This was not intended, however, as a mere sterile act of the intellect without reference to the will. The eternal and blessed existence of the gods which was the chief and most worthy object of contemplation was, in fact, the realization and model of the Epicurean moral ideal. Epicurus wrote to his disciple Menoeceus, exhorting him to fidelity to the moral teachings of the School: Meditate therefore on these things and things akin to them night and day by yourself and with a companion like to yourself, and never shall you be disturbed, wak- ing or sleeping, but you shall live like a god among men.2' Lucretius repeats this thought in the lines: illud in his rebus video firmare potesse usque adeo naturarum vestigia linqui parvula quae nequeat ratio depellere nobis ut nil impediat dignam dis degere vitam.22 It would be a mistake to interpret these lines as mere conventional expressions. So perfectly, in fact, do the descriptions of the divine life in the intermundia reflect the ethi- cal ideals of Epicurus that it is difficult not to see in these descriptions a projection into the theology of a preconceived standard of ex- cellence. The gods of the intraspatial Olym- pus were for the Epicureans humanity "writ large" as truly as were the traditional gods of mythology.23 The third and most interesting aspect of Epicurean piety, the notion of communion with the gods, is thus described by Lucretius: quae nisi respuis ex animo longeque remittis dis indigna putare alienaque pacis eorum, delibata deum per te tibi numina sancta saepe oberunt; non quo violari summa deum vis possit, ut ex ira poenas petere imbibat acris, sed quia tute tibi placida cum pace quietos constitues magnos irarum volvere fluctus, nec delubra deum placido cum pectore adibis, nec de corpore quae sancto simulacra feruntur in mentis hominum divinae nuntia formae, suscipere haec animi tranquilla pace valebis.24 These lines are the fullest explanation of Epicurean religion known to us.25 Supposi- tions which are unworthy of the majesty of the gods do harm to the worshiper because they disturb the tranquility of the reverent act. When his mind is agitated he is unable to receive in peace the simulacra of the gods which bring calm to the souls of men. Clearly, there is here expressed the belief that there is a communion between gods and men ef- fected by the visitations of divine "images." The exact nature of the religious experience thus described is, unfortunately, not known to us; it seems certain, however, that such moments of union with the simulacra and the peace of spirit consequent thereon are the supreme reward of true piety. It is important to remember that such "visitations" could, according to Epicurus, take place only by physical contact of the atoms which consti- tuted the divine "idols" with the atoms of which the human mind was composed, a fact clear from the Epicurean psychology which attempts to validate in terms of atomic mon- ism, perception, both sensory and supra- sensory, only through the medium of "idols" -atomic films cast off from the surface of the object perceived and impinging upon the I98</page><page sequence="5">PIETAS EPICUREA organ of perception. The absolute inerrancy of such perception was a fundamental postu- late of the system; for to deny its validity was to faii into a hopeless scepticism. This prin- ciple is of peculiar importance in Epicurean theology, for the occurrence of "divine vi- sions" through the medium of the simulacra is the empirical basis on which the chief ar- gument for the existence of gods was con- structed.26 Lucretius describes such visita- tions in some detail.27 Owing to the subtlety of their component atoms-for the gods of Epicurus were com- posed of the finest matter possible-the di- vine images could be perceived by the mind only with considerable difficulty; in fact, a special mode of perception seems to have been required.28 It is this act of reception which is dissipated by internal disquiet and external distractions. The pious man, therefore, if he is to profit by the advent of the divinae nuntia formae, must free his mind and his heart from all thoughts unworthy of the gods. The public religious festivals were happy occasions for experiencing such communion with the gods; for the reverence of the circum- stances assisted the act of reception which was a prerequisite to the perception of the divine visitations. That is why Epicurus was a faithful attendant at acts of public worship (nothing is known of Lucretius' practice in this regard); it is this, not hypocrisy, which explains his profession of piety. Invocations and petitions he considered worthless; it was the internal experience which he treasured, for in it was rooted that tranquility of soul which was man's true and only happiness. Contemplation, imitation and communion -these were the elements of Epicurean piety. Vague and misty as it may seem (the evidence on the matter being very incomplete), it was a positive religious doctrine whose sincerity there is no legitimate reason to doubt. It was, according to Bailey, a religious concept "far more exalted than the traditional beliefs which Lucretius decries."29 That the gods of Epicurus were worthy of so lofty a reverence may well be doubted; that a theology so subtle would easily elude the intelligence of the multi intent on finding in Epicureanism only a rational justification of hedonism is a fact tllat cannot be denied. To this extent history is on the side of Cicero. That Epicurus or Lucretius professed athe- ism, however, is an error directly contradicted by the evidence. NOTES 1 De Natura Deorum 1.2.3.
