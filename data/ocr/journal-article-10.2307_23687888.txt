In Woodstock, as soon as we were settled in a spacious, sunny studio perched on a hill—above the brook and off the main road—I began at once to compose the music of Jephtha's Daughter. I finished it at the end of our seven weeks in Woodstock. It is curious how cycles of creative life round themselves out, and how gleams of mental affinities strain each other like the needles of a sea star in a live coral reef. The spurt for the composing of ]ephtha surely came from my browsing about in papal Rome and viewing the great repositories of Biblical art. I surely thought again, without perhaps being aware of it, of turning the Jephtha story into a musical drama, while looking at Michelangelo's Moses at San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome; or when I stood only a few steps from his David at the Accademia of Florence—just before speaking to the large academic audience gathered to hear my address and concert.
