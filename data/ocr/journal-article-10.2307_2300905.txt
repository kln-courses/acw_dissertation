<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DECEMBER MEETING OF THE MARYLAND-VIRGINIA- DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SECTION The twenty-eighth regular meeting of the Maryland-Virginia-District of Columbia Section of the Mathematical Association of America was held at American University, Washington, D.C., on Saturday, December 13, 1930. Ses- sions were held in the morning and in the afternoon; Professor Clara L. Bacon, chairman of the Section, presided at both sessions. Seventy persons attended the meeting, including the following thirty-nine members of the Association: 0. S. Adams, Beatrice Aitchison, G. F. Alrich, R. N. Ashmun, Clara L. Bacon, G. A. Bingley, J. G. Burke, G. R. Clements, Abraham Cohen, Alexander Dillingham, J. A. Duerksen, P. J. Federico, Michael Goldberg, Harry Gwinner, W. M. Hamilton, F. E. Johnston, L. M. Kells, W. D. Lambert, Florence M. Mears, Eugenie M. Morenus, W. K. Morrill, F. D. Murnaghan, 0. J. Ramler, C. H. Rawlins, Jr., W. F. Reynolds, J. N. Rice, H. M. Robert, Jr., R. E. Root, W. F. Shenton, J. H. Taylor, John Tyler, WV. J. Wallis, F. M. Weida, C. H.Wheeler, III, John Williamson, G. T. Whyburn E. W. Woolard, R. C. Yates, Oscar Zariski. Preceding the afternoon session, a business meeting was held. A nominating committee, to report at the next meeting, was appointed, as follows: W. D. Lam- bert, chairman, A. Cohen and J. B. Scarborough. It was decided that the custom of having a luncheon provided for those attending the meetings of the Section should be abandoned, and that in the future each individual should personally bear the expense of his own luncheon, but that arrangements should be made for the group to have luncheon together. Appreciation of the hospitality accorded the Section by American University was expressed. An invitation from Professor C. H. Wheeler, III to hold the next meeting at the University of Richmond, Va., and to be guests of the University, was accepted. At the morning session the following four papers were presented: 1. "An engineer's method of solving cubic and quiartic equations" by Harry Gwinner, University of Maryland. 2. "Small vibrations of particles in systems analogous to certain organic compounds" by R. C. Yates, The Johns Hopkins University. 3. "Integral powers of Bazin's matrix" by J. \Villiamson, The Johns Hop- kins University. 4. "Some naval tactics in analytic geometry" by C. H. Rawlins, Jr., Post- graduate School, U. S. Naval Academy. An abstract of the second of these papers follows: 2. The dynamics of various systems of particles were studied with the pur- pose of determining the characteristic properties of the homopolar chemical bond. The equations of motion were set up and fundamental frequencies found and compared with Raman data of representative organic compounds. Certain pro- portionality (force) constants were calculated, and resulting wave numbers for 363</page><page sequence="2">364 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE KANSAS SECTION [Aug.-Sept., C02, CH2Cl2, C2H50H, C6H6, C3H6, CH3CHO, and CH3CN were found to be in good agreement with observed data. After luncheon the unique library of rare old mathematical books in the possession of American University was open for inspection. A special exhibit of many of the works of particular interest had been arranged by Professor Shen- ton, who presented much interesting information about the library. The afternoon session was devoted to an excellent expository lecture on "The modern trend in geometry, and its connection with physical theories" by Professor F. D. Murnaghan, of The Johns Hopkins University. Professor Mur- naghan traced the development of geometry from Euclid, through Riemann and Levi-Civita, to the most recent contributions of Cartan; outlined the evolution of physical theories from the ancient period of anthropomorphism and personi- fication, through the period of mechanical models, to the present era of abstract mathematical representations; and pointed out the role of modern geometry in the construction of an absolute mathematical representation which shall be independent of the coordinate-language that is used.
