<plain_text><page sequence="1">Family Resemblance and the Definition of Religion Benson Saler In this article I attempt to do three things. First, to express my views about the idea of family resemblance relative to the problem of defining religion. Second, to suggest a partial answer to a question posed by Luther Martin and his fellow panelists at the 1996 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion: if we assign causality to religion, to what are we assigning it? And third, to enter a caveat respecting the replacement of popular analytical categories. Fitzgerald and Byrne The idea of family resemblance as it may relate to the definition of religion has recently been considered by Timothy Fitzgerald.1 Fitzgerald adduces reasons to fault both essentialist and family resemblance solutions to the problem of defining religion. With respect to the latter, he claims that "the concept of religion must have some essential characteristic, and if it does not, then the family of religion becomes so large as to be practically meaningless and analytically useless." He maintains, moreover, that "the concept of religion has no distinctive 1.

And he recommends that persons in departments of religious studies turn their attentions to "cultural studies," which he characterizes as "the analysis and interpretation of the values institutionalized by different societies."2 As a cultural anthropologist, I endorse Fitzgerald's call for the study of values. But I do so independently of his claim about family resemblance. Indeed, I reject that claim. And 1 deem the strategy that he adopted for justifying it to be dubious in principle and unfortunate in execution. Fitzgerald chose to depend very largely on one effort to connect family resemblance and religion, that of Peter Byrne in an article of twenty-five pages published in 1988. Fitzgerald's dependence on that one source is relieved only modestly by references to a book that Byrne published in 1989 on the legacy of deism, by brief allusions to Ninian Smart, and by a one-sentence quotation from A.J. Ayer describing what Wittgenstein meant by family resemblance.3 Fitzgerald does not quote, cite or otherwise engage Wittgenstein directly, perhaps supposing Byrne's reading of that philosopher to be adequate. Nor, in a paper in which the word philosophy is given a prominent place in the title, does he expand our understanding by invoking the views of other philosophers (save for Byrne) on the subject of family resemblance. He thus ignores such oft cited works, pro and con, as those of J. R. Bambrough and Keith Campbell.4 Nor does he consider the contributions of the recurrence theorist Richard Aaron or such resemblance theorists as H. H. Price and A. D. Woozley, philosophers whose views bear certain family resemblances to those of Wittgenstein but who offer their own distinct perspectives and advocacies.5 Fitzgerald's declared justification for his strategy is that Byrne is "a competent Oxford-trained philosopher with a lucid style and a considerable ability to present systematic argument." Further, he notes 2. Ibid, 1996, pp. 216, 232-233. 3. Peter Byrne, "Religion and the Religions" in The World's Religions, S.R. Sutherland et al, ed.

Fitzgerald intimates that these are occasioned by application of the idea of family resemblance to the definition of religion. I, in contrast, deem them to be occasioned by Byrne's efforts to apply that idea. While Fitzgerald is prepared to reject family resemblance on the basis of his analysis of Byrne's essay, I am not. Byrne's paper makes some valuable points, but it also suffers from certain limitations. And, of course, it is only one of several efforts to apply family resemblance to the problem of defining religion. Some appreciation of the problems involved can be gleaned from a consideration of two matters noted by Fitzgerald. First, Byrne writes that religious beliefs in his schema are concerned with "God, or the gods or more generally sacred things," and he opines that the "sacred" (in a more or less Durkheimian sense) can contribute to distinguishing religion from other things.7 Fitzgerald rightly observes that Byrne's use of the sacred moves in the direction of introducing a necessary condition for distinguishing religion.8 Byrne, on my reading, attempts to guard against such a charge by stressing that the sacred is "vague," that there is no "simple formula" that can give an adequate idea of its complexity, and that "fixing the object of religion" by using the sacred is advantageous because the object is then "broad enough to include religious realities (such as nirvana) which are none the less not divine."9 In part, then, the sacred is to be preferred because it frees us from making gods the object of religion. But this would seem to substitute a broader necessity for a narrower one. Second, Fitzgerald remarks that it is "unclear . . . whether Byrne is advocating a use for the word religion, or merely drawing our attention to how it is in fact used."10 That observation touches on a crucial problem: how to go from an understanding of the way people actually use many words and concepts to the scholarly prescription of an analytical category. 6.

Fitzgerald, 1996, p. 216.</page><page sequence="4">394 Historical Reflections/Réñexions Historiques Byrne recognizes common uses of the term religion. He goes on to draw a distinction between operational and essentialist definitions, a distinction that Fitzgerald finds unconvincing. In an effort to formulate an operational definition, Byrne proffers a definition by genus and differentiae. He describes religion as an "institution" with four dimensions: the theoretical, the practical, the sociological, the experiential. These conjunctively establish it as a genus, albeit he notes that "a religion need not show all four dimensions in developed form"11 The institution, moreover, "may be further distinguished by three types of differentiae which qualify the dimensions making up its genus." These are the object of the complex ("gods or sacred things"), goals ("salvation or ultimate good"), and functions ("giving an overall meaning to life or providing the identity or cohesion of a social group").12 This neat and cerebral exercise, if not actually a case of essentialist recidivism, strikes me as coming uncomfortably close to being such. Byrne, nevertheless, verges on a solution that could be true to the spirit of family resemblance. He notes that ordinary usage of the term religion points to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism as religions, but that we get "no clear guidance from ordinary usage as to whether Confucianism" is to be included as a religion or as an ethical system. And in various places in his essay he talks of "central examples of religion."13 Unfortunately, however, Byrne does not enlarge productively on these insights. He might have done so had he invoked some arresting findings and powerful theorizing in the cognitive sciences. In any case, Byrne's self-defeating maneuvers to solve the definitional problem by invoking family resemblance indirectly support what I regard as an important point: namely, that a family resemblance approach by itself is inadequate to the task of formulating a prescriptive analytical category. Something else is also required. We can begin to solve the definitional problem by first considering family resemblance and then going beyond it in directions taken by prototype theory. These directions are suggested to some extent by certain of Wittgenstein's insights, such as his recognition of the centrality 1 1 . Byrne, pp. 8-9, emphasis added. 12. Ibid., p. 7. 13. Ibid., pp. 9, 20.</page><page sequence="5">Family Resemblance 395 or paradigmatic status of natural numbers for the conceptualization of other kinds of numbers.14 But prototype theory goes further. Family Resemblance Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblance, as Richard Chaney points out, has "to do with how we use our words and concepts. " 15 When, for instance, we apply a general word such as "game" to a diversity of different games, it is not because all games share some one feature or some specific conjunction of features in common. "Don't say:," Wittgenstein advises, "There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games' - but look and see whether there is anything common to all." And when you look, you do not find some specific commonality. Rather, you see "a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail."16 Wittgenstein does not claim that members of groups never share something in common. Rather, he holds that the same general term can be applied to diverse phenomena even when they do not share any one feature or specific conjunction of features in common. Indeed, in some cases some things to which the same general term is applied share no discrete features in common. In such cases, however, they typically overlap in features with still other things called by the same general term, those others serving as intermediaries that link together those that share no features, just as the intermediary links in a chain connect the peripheral links on either end. The philosopher J. Renford Bambrough, in explicating Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblance, compares and contrasts Wittgenstein to nominalists and realists. The nominalist, Bambrough says, is right to insist that the instances of a general term need not share some one feature in common; but the nominalist is wrong to suppose that the application of such a term lacks objective justification. And the realist is right to maintain that there is some objective justification for the application of a general term; but the realist is wrong to insist that the instances of a general term 1 4.

Wittgenstein, says Bambrough, is in accord with what is supportable in the respective positions of nominalists and realists while avoiding their respective mistakes. "He asserts at one and the same time," says Bambrough, "the realist's claim that there is an objective justification for the application of the word 'game' to games and the nominalist's claim that there is no element that is common to all games."17 That objective justification is the linkage, the apperceived overlapping similarities, that supports the practice of applying the same general term to those diverse phenomena that we call "games." The same, I think, can be said of our application of the term "religion." We - both as scholars and as participants in other discourses - use the term "religion" in various ways. I advocate that for scholarly purposes we build on this, and that we formally conceive of religion in terms of a pool of elements that more or less co-occur in what scholars generally regard as the clearest or least problematical examples of what they call religion. Those elements - we could conceive of them as a set of predicates - collectively define our conceptual model. The instantiations of that model are what we call religions, and they differentially participate in the pool. The instantiations are linked by family resemblances; they need not all share some one element or some specific subset of elements. Further, the category facilitated by our model is unbounded in that there is no sure or stable border where religion ends and nonreligion begins. Rather, we have some very clear cases of what we mean by religion, and then increasingly peripheral cases. Whether or not to admit peripheral cases (e.g., Canonical Theravada Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Communism) is a matter for scholarly argument relative to our defining pool of features and their linkages rather than a matter to be settled by definitional fiat. The elements that we predicate of our general model of religion are what Jackendoff calls typicality features.18 That is, they can be said to be typical of religion, although they may sometimes be discerned in the instantiations of other categories. All of them pertain to our conceptual model of religion, and many of them are found in our clearest exemplars of the category. Less clear cases are less clear because, typically, they manifest fewer of the typicality features of our model; moreover, they typically show less elaboration and emphases of those features. 17.

Analytical categories are likely to engender problems in application regardless of how they are organized. But there are special difficulties that attach to family resemblance categories. Fitzgerald voices the most commonly heard complaint when he warns (wrongly, I believe) that if religion has no "essential characteristic, . . . then the family of religion becomes so large as to be practically meaningless and analytically useless."19 He misses what I regard as the paramount difficulty. That is, if we once accept and try to use "religion" as an analytical category organized by family resemblances, our commitment to the very idea of family resemblance may well lead us to recognize a terrible (but not a fatal) truth: that it is family resemblances all the way down! I illustrate what I mean at two different analytical levels. First, denominated religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and so forth, are not unitary phenomena. They constitute families of religions, and each of those families is organized by resemblances. Thus, for instance, Christianity is a congeries of many Christianities linked by overlapping similarities but divided by differences. Elements that unite some Christianities separate off still others. Take, for example, the doctrine of the dual nature of Christ, a doctrine specifically predicable of the Christian family of religions but not predicable of all Christianities. Monophysite churches reject the doctrine. And so, too, do various persons who consider themselves Christians but hold that Christ is human and not divine. Some other Christians, who claim that Christ is both human and divine, reject as Christians those who do not profess belief in the divinity of Christ. And some persons who deem themselves Christians repudiate the Monophysites as well, on the ground that a "true" Christian regards Christ as fully human as well as fully divine. In either case, of course, the rejecters essentialize Christianity since they stipulate a necessary condition for being Christian. What is the scholar to do? Take sides and say that some people who call themselves Christian are not really such? Or treat them all as Christians, though of different kinds? The latter alternative, in my opinion, is the responsible and productive one. Second, the elements that we predicate of our general model of religion - theism, belief in souls, ritual, sacrifice, sacred canon, eschatology, pilgrimage, etc. - are themselves family resemblance categories. While many anthropologists may not quite realize that is so, numbers of them recognize that conventional, essentialist definitions of 19. Fitzgerald, 1996, p. 216.</page><page sequence="8">398 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques category terms do not suffice for cross-cultural purposes in any precise fashion. Thus, for example, Maurice Bloch writes: Anthropologists are increasingly familiar with the idea that such terms as "sacrifice," "possession" and "initiation" have a very limited validity in religious anthropology. Such definitions are always rooted in a specific cultural tradition, whether that of the author or of the people he writes about, and are therefore inadequate for cross-cultural analyses. They may be used provisionally, as convenient pointers, but if their application is stretched beyond that they become arbitrary. If general theoretical interpretations are to be attempted at all, they cannot be confined within these sorts of boundaries. And, again, Like a number of recent writers ... I believe it is right to stress the great variety that exists among the various examples of "sacrifice" as they have been described in the anthropological literature. . . . The phenomena which have been called by names such as totemism or sacrifice are not so varied as to make the words useless as general indicators of linked manifestations. On the other hand these manifestations are so loosely connected that it would be totally pointless to look for an explanation of sacrifice as such . . .20 Prototype Theory While there maybe no necessary core element, no common essence, to all of the phenomena that scholars treat as examples of "sacrifice" in religions, two observations can be entered by way of suggesting that there is some systematicity to such treatments. First, scholars tend to identify occurrences in non-Western cultures as instances of "sacrifice" by positing analogies to what they elsewhere call sacrifices. Analogies are ways of discerning similarities in things that otherwise differ. Analogous things are not identical. Grouping by analogy is common, both in ordinary life and scholarship, and things grouped together are typically assigned the same general term. Thus, for instance, 20. Maurice Bloch, Prey Into Hunter: The Politics of Religious Experience (Cambridge, 1992), pp. 2, 25.</page><page sequence="9">Family Resemblance 399 the Western scholar identifies "religion" in non-Western societies that have no name for, or concept of, "religion" by finding analogies to what that scholar regards as instances of religion elsewhere. This, of course, raises a very important question: analogy to what? Second, phenomena that serve as springboards for drawing analogies are usually things that we take to be fairly clear examples of their categories. With respect to "sacrifice," for instance, scholars may have in mind ancient Greek sacrifices (which were varied), Jewish sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem (which arose out of earlier forms of sacrifice), and Christian ideas about the sacrifice of Christ (where in most accounts the sacrificer sacrifices himself). None fully matches in form, content, meaning or social significance the sacrifices performed by the Dinka of the Sudan as described and analyzed by Lienhardt and discussed by Bloch.21 It would be foolish to impose, say, Christian ideas about Christ's sacrifice in an effort to achieve an understanding of Dinka practices. But if we suppose, as Bloch maintains, that there is no common essence to all sacrifices, our clearest examples of sacrifice can nevertheless prove useful. They can provide the wherewithal for drawing analogies and foregrounding similarities and differences. Our clearest examples, indeed, can prove useful for purposes of illustration, reference and comparison. But they themselves do not disclose the structure of their category. We may call these clearest examples "prototypes," or the most prototypical exemplars of their category, following the psychologist Eleanor Rosch, who writes: "By prototypes of categories we have generally meant the clearest cases of category membership defined operationally by peoples' judgements of goodness of membership in the category."22 And this serves to introduce the subject of prototype theory. Prototype theory can be narrowly characterized as systematic efforts to account for prototype effects. Prototype effects are asymmetries in judgments people render respecting how well examples or instantiations of categories exemplify their categories. Thus, for example, some people judge apples and oranges to be clearer examples of fruit than olives, and some people judge robins and sparrows to be clearer examples of birds than penguins. 21.

(Hillsdale, NJ, 1978), p. 36.</page><page sequence="10">400 Historical Reflections/Réfíexions Historiques Research indicates that prototype effects are virtually ubiquitous for natural language categories of all sorts, including not only those organized by family resemblance but essentialist categories as well.23 Prototype effects, for instance, are registered for ungraded bounded categories such as "bird" as well as for graded categories such as "tall person." These finding cannot be accounted for by the classical or essentialist Western theory of categorization. That theory holds that all members of a category must meet the same necessary conditions for inclusion, and that those that do are equally members of the group comprehended by the category. The classical view constitutes a bivalent (or, metaphorically speaking, a "digital") approach to categorizing whereby everything in the world is either a member or not a member of any denominated category. What, then, gives rise to prototype effects? Prototype theorists propose various answers for different sorts of categories, and they suggest that for some (but not necessarily all) categories a multivalent (or, metaphorically speaking, an "analog") approach is realistic. Instead of category membership always being a matter of "yes or no," it is sometimes a matter of "more or less," as, I argue, is the case for the category religion.24 The discovery that prototype effects are virtually ubiquitous for all sorts of natural language categories, and the recognition that the classical theory of categorization is inadequate because it cannot account for that finding, have momentous implications for the scholarly enterprise. Our attentions to the world, and our understandings, depend on categorization. And now we have evidence that our classical theory of categorization - the theory entertained (and positively cathected) by many (probably most) of the readers of these lines - needs to be discarded and to be replaced by a new theory - one that will take adequate account of the appreciable complexity in the developments, structures and uses of categories. The linguist George Lakoff affirms - and he should be taken seriously - that, "To change the very concept of a category is to change not only our concept of the mind, but also our understanding of the world."25 Prototype theory complements and in certain ways incorporates Wittgenstein's family resemblance construct. Indeed, it celebrates various 23. See, e.g., Sharon Lee Armstrong, lila R. Gleitman and Henry Gleitman, "On What Some Concepts Might Not Be," Cognition 13 (1983): 263-308. 24.

George Lakoff, Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind (Chicago, 1987), p. 9.</page><page sequence="11">Family Resemblance 401 of his ideas, including, as Eleanor Rosch phrases it, the important "insight that we can judge how clear a case something is and deal with categories on the basis of clear cases in the total absence of information about boundaries."26 Prototype theory goes beyond family resemblance. While Wittgenstein's construct is a handy, almost colloquial, way of freeing us from certain "bewitchments" in our thinking about the ways we use terms and concepts, prototype theory seeks to comprehend and explain the structures of different sorts of categories (e.g., graded categories, radial categories and others). In one promising line of investigation, for example, efforts are made to posit different sorts of "idealized cognitive models" that could account for those different structures.27 It also has much of value to say about tropes and their important place in human life. My recommendation, given in greater detail elsewhere, is that we view religion as a graded category the instantiations of which are linked by family resemblances.28 Graded categories are exemplified by such familiar categories as "tall person" and "rich person." There are no universally accepted standards for drawing a sharp line between the tall and the not tall and the rich and the not rich, although public and private agencies sometimes offer guidelines. And these categories are graded because some tall persons are taller than others and some rich persons richer than others. Religion, of course, is a far more complex matter than these homey examples, since it rests on a large set of elements or predicates and, moreover, we need to take account of their elaborations and complexities. But it otherwise resembles the examples cited. Some religions are characterized by more of the typicality features that we associate with religion than others. In a manner of speaking, some religions (e.g., Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism) are more religious than what some (but not all) scholars regard as other religions (e.g., Taoism, Confucianism, Communism). Where, you may ask, does the category give out? There is no sharp cutoff point, nor do we need one. Rather, we have some clear cases of religion and then increasingly less clear ones. As I suggested earlier, scholars must make recommendations about inclusion or exclusion relative to their interests, and they must support those recommendations with analysis and argument, not definitional fiat. While the category is in this sense unbounded, that does not mean, as Fitzgerald charges, that 26. Rosch, p. 36. 27. Lakoff. 28. See my Conceptualizing Religion.</page><page sequence="12">402 Historical Reflections/Reflexions Historiques "the family of religion becomes so large as to be practically meaningless and analytically useless. "29 As our typicality features increasingly diminish, there will be fewer reasons to label increasingly peripheral candidates "religion." Our category is distinguished by central tendencies, not necessary features, and centrality implies periphery rather than fixed borders. Perhaps I can render this strategy more understandable by using illustrations drawn from recommendations about defining religion proposed by my fellow panelists at the 1 997 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, Stewart Guthrie and Brian K. Smith.30 Smith proposes to define religion in terms of canonical reflexivity. Using that as a distinguishing feature, he is compelled by the logic of his position to include "Marxism" and "Freudianism" under the rubric of religion. I deem Smith's discussion of canonical reflexivity to be a valuable contribution to the study of religions. But I regard canonical reflexivity to be typical of religions and not, by itself, definitive of them. The fact, then, that it can be predicated of both Marxism and Freudianism does not, ipso facto, identify them as religions. Guthrie's discussion of the significance of anthropomorphism in human life is the most wide-ranging by far of any that I have seen, and I find his account of why anthropomorphism is so widely distributed to be cogent and persuasive. His characterization of religion in terms of what he calls "systematic" anthropomorphism, moreover, seems agreeably analog, for systematicity cannot be fixed in any precise or exhaustive way. I regard anthropomorphism to be typical of religions. But, as Guthrie demonstrates, it is also found in many other things. I do not deem systematic anthropomorphism in itself to be definitive of religion. Religion, like love, is "a many-splendored thing," and I prefer to conceptualize it as such. Religion as a Causal Factor Based on my conceptualization of religion, I can suggest a partial answer to the question posed by Luther Martin and his fellow panelists at the 1 996 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion. If we invoke religion as a causal factor in explanatory chains, to what are 29. Fitzgerald, 1996, p. 216. 30. Stewart E.

Smith, "Exorcising the Transcendent: Strategies for Defining Hinduism and Religion," History of Religions 27 (1987): 32-55.</page><page sequence="13">Family Resemblance 403 we attributing causality? My answer, very briefly, is that while we may use "religion" as a term of convenience, we need to identify in each instance those specific aspects or elements of religion to which we might ascribe causal powers. Other features of religion may well support those aspects or elements, and so might be said to have causal value also, but less intensely or less directly in whatever may be the case at hand. In most instances, I think, it will be specific aspects of religions, as variously localized in time and place, that deserve emphasis in causal posits. Substituting Categories Finally, I want to enter a brief caveat respecting calls to do away with popular analytical categories- and perhaps the disciplines with which they are associated- because they are problem-plagued. Fitzgerald, it may be recalled, urges scholars of religion to abandon "religion" in favor of "cultural studies," the "analysis and interpretation of the values institutionalized by different societies."31 I think it very likely that if we substitute one category for another, let alone one discipline for another, we will find that we have substituted one set of problems for some other. The term "value," for example, has a number of connotations; it is not easy to define in a way that elicits consensus among scholars, and values are sometimes difficult to establish in any clear way.32 And "ideology," which is currently very fashionable, is difficult to discuss without waxing ideological. Terms such as "religion," "sacrifice," "value" and so forth are conveniences. They allow us to talk about things that interest us in more or less intelligible fashion. And we can do so even though the terms themselves are polysemous and the categories to which they pertain are organized by family resemblances. We need to be cognizant of their complexities and subtleties, however, if we are to avoid using them in rigid and otherwise nonproductive ways. And we need also to have some sense of their connotations. That is an especially vexing source of problems in the human sciences for, as John Dewey notes: 31. Fitzgerald, 1996, p. 232. 32. See Ethel M. Albert, "The Classification of Values," American Anthropologist 58 (1 956): 22 1 -248; Victor Ayoub, "The Study of Values" in Introduction to Cultural Anthropology.

There is almost no word employed in psychological or societal analysis and description that does not reflect this influence.33 If substitution of categories or disciplines will not save us from problems, how, then, might scholars avoid them? We could attempt to emulate that paragon of philosophers, Cratylus, who eventually judged language to be so deceitful that he retired into silence, wagging a finger now and then to communicate. He, it must be admitted, adopted a solution that was consistent with his analysis. But I suspect that most of you will join me in rejecting it. And by rejecting it, we go on talking in a scholarly vein: which is to say, problematically. 33. John Dewey, "Antinaturalism in Extremis" in Naturalism and the Human Spirit, Yervant H. Krikorian, ed.
