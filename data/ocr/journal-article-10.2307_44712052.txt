<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT* We are never more human than when we are dogs. H. Cixous1 1. It's no use. There is no hope, not a dog's chance. Whatever I write in this essay, who will go root out Grattius' poem The World of Hunting to Houndsl No course- teacher will track him down, whether as Augustan writer or as didactic poet. Big books about Latin Literature have to be perfectly inclusive works of reference if they are to spare him a sop, and even then he'll barely get a sniff (of precis) in the paragraph he is allotted. Ancient writers leave him without a trace: only the exceptional circum- stances of exile had whining Ovid lump him - in 28th place - into his exhaustively comprehensive catalogue of contemporary writers, meant to figure collectively that non-event The Action at Rome minus Naso', in the last of his Letters from Pontus (4.16.34: our sole testimonium). So he has never been needed for writing about any other author. Grattius could in theory lead the pack in any investigation of the impact and reception of Virgil's Georgics in the Latin literary tradition, but his work has got lost in the tangled undergrowth of minor Silver Latin poetry. Even the most gargantuan and panoramic Latin scholarship takes no notice. Most work on classical didactic is equally blank - and, trust me or check it out, even Latin didactic poetry normally gets by without Grattius.2 So it's not at all clear (and this must be the justification) that * This primae lucis opus is dedicated to early bird Richard Hunter, and in mem. Pharoah, magna fides tutelaque. It was written for my friends Don Fowler and Alessandro Schiesaro. 1 H.

Pohlmann, 'Charakteristika des r√∂mischen Lehrgedichts' , ANRW 1.3(1 973) 8 1 3-90, at 858f., has just one grudging nullity of a paragraph. B. Effe, 'Dichtung und Lehre. Untersuchungen zur Typologie des antiken Lehrgedichts' (Munich, 1977 = Zetemata 69) 154-65 is the most generous (and useful) allotment. Collections such as A. Cox, 'Didactic poetry', in J. Higginbotham (ed.), Greek and Latin Literature. A comparative study (London, 1969) 124-61 pass Grattius by, no question, in the tracks of e.g. J. Conington, revised by H. Nettleship (ed.), P.

(But ...) ... There is no point pretending that Grottius is a long-scorned classic overdue for revaluation, or - Goodness Grattius! - that Greattius is a coming thing, soon to receive overdue attention.3 Even his content , which figures surprisingly mutely even in books on ancient canines, Roman horses, or hunting through Antiquity, claims virtually no share of our interest in the social life of classical civilisation, however broad-focussed our vista.4 No, not every dog has his day. So. So there is everything to learn here, about Teaching Texts. The text we do not teach ought to be just the place for us to catch the cradle of assumptions we rest our teaching on. If we're ferreting out the conditions of literary pedagogy by studying the habits and dispositions of texts that play to a didactic rhetoric, in relation to the manipulation and hustling we ourselves practise by teaching (with, through, over) texts. To make no bones about it, writing up (or even writing down) Grattius is not the way to enter the critical ring.5 The dogfight of fresh contributions to the understanding of a canonical author is normally an axiomatic dimension of any Latinist' s performance. In fact, many hold it to be constitutive - and I imagine that has a lot to do with why they write the way they do. Despite this, the ground rules of criticism are, you may be relieved to learn/recall, set by the practice of the players as readers, not as writers. For very little indeed is published about classical works that is lapped up for the critic rather than the work. The basic result of the classical canon being so deeply settled is that our teachers - uniquely -, are not obliged to learn what to read, what to regard as rewarding, what is central. The author is the thing, not the critic. Whereas in the present instance, either my vanity must imaginarily anticipate a line of readers longing for my latest effusion, or I must be meaning to buck the system (what else?). I shall not provide an authorised statement about this (this - ironic? - provocation is all you get) - but rather I shall present Grattius as my subject, because I know this will not satisfy you. The most important pay-off from exclusive devotion to the Classical Text has been that the conditions within which critics write are relegated to a negligible nuisance-value, compared to their significance in throwing light on their chosen classic. 3 F. Buecheler, 'Coniectanea', RhM 35 ( 1 880) 407, himself punning Grattius/ gratius , re-doubles the case for spelling -tt-. (But not for thinking it: the poem puns repeatedly on the forbidden name, cf. Formicola (n. 2) 154, on v. 216.) 4 One mention in the text of D. B. Hull, Hounds and Hunting in Ancient Greece (Chicago, 1 964) 34: 'And what were Grattius' "Metagontes"?'. None at all in J. M. C. Toynbee, Animals in Roman Art and Life (London, 1973) 102-24, 'Dogs' (102-6, 'Hunting Dogs', 330f., on treatment of sick dogs). J. K. Anderson, Hunting in the Ancient World (California, 1985) 93-5 whips through Grattius' Cyneg., patting him for knowledge, but lamenting his 'after-dinner audiences' literariness. 5 Grattius is so marginal, so minor, that the scholarship on him is sporadic, extraordinarily tralaticious, and either casually ob iter or else tirocinium commissioned by a series, for completeness' sake. There is nothing conceivably like a critical debate. Only dogmatic Housman, in fine fettle: 'Notes on Grattius', CQ 28 (1934) 127-33.</page><page sequence="3">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 3 This allows and ensures that classicists write as if in the company of the great chain of their predecessors, and as if they should regret it when, or rather that, they cannot. With Grattius, there is not even any deflection from this schema in the (marginalised) form of a contribution from reception across the history of reading. For Grattius' day has never dawned. No, it's no use, the situation is stark - and, cynicism apart, there is no hope at all. The more doomed, then, the more this speedy essay hares along for all its worth, to impugn the grattuitous anthropocentrism of the West.6 2. Grattius' Cynegetica is a substantial Augustan work (you would think that in itself would absolutely guarantee attention?), so how can it not be fair game? The poem does lack dedicatee and precipitating occasion. It discloses zilch about the person of its author. And it isn't complete: the last (few?) lines of what might have been a first book are lacking (spoiled by the wearing of a final dog-eared page, or - ?). Did we lose a climax, or were what we have once just preliminaries? Who can say? Anyhow, Grattius trots out his material with a straight face, as if it mattered. His work has traditionally been misdirected to the delectation of connoisseurs of hunting, but, let's be clear, there is no hunting in (our) Grattius. (So you'd need to be a real connoisseur?) The hue and cry itself is still to come, the kill never arrives. The Hunt is (instead, as it would be in any case) a technological domain, a challenge for ingenuity and systematic thinking, not (yet) salivating fun or full-blooded sado-sport. The poem invests energy in all its referential trappings and paraphernalia, rubs our noses in its dog's breakfast of insemination and surgery, but by the same token the writing bids us, in no uncertain terms, to attend from the start to the replication of the work of hunting in its representation. So why not play the dualistic (schizoid) game of reading didactic: follow the writer/teacher, earnestly absorbing the details, and orienting around the pattern of affect which their explication cathects; join in with the writer's effort to embody in textual rhetoric the collective exploit of rationality that may be read in the inventiveness materialised in all the devices and know-how of hunters all and everywhere, from when we came down from the trees; and savour the writer's effort to impersonate - but also to theorise, to capture conceptually - the Hunter's mindset?7 Not that this can be enthused over, but Grattius presumably chased up and chewed over Greek writings on hunting to hounds other than Xenophon's extant prose essay, 6 Grattius doesn't lecture on his attitude to animals, but with it. For the standard traits of Graeco-Roman stoicising anthropocentrism, see U. Dierauer, Tier und Mensch im Denken der Antike (Amsterdam, 1 977), esp. 238^15. 7 Cf. esp. C. M. C. Green, 'Terms of venery: Ars Amatoria I', TAPA 126 (1996) 221-63, D. F. Kennedy, 'Bluff your way in didactic: Ovid's Ars Amatoria and Remedia Amoris' Arethusa 33 (2000) 159-86. Carlo Ginzburg' s narratological notion of a 'paradigme cyn√©g√©tique', where narrative mimes the primeval hermeneutics of running down material clues, points hypothetical readers of Grattius (and me) toward retrieving a distinctive model of knowledge-formation from his specific management of diegesis (see C. Prendergast, The Order of Mimesis. Balzac , Stendhal, Nerval, Flaubert (Cambridge, 1986) 220-3). So, if I am not much mistaken, does Cyneg. 1-23.</page><page sequence="4">4 JOHN HENDERSON Kunegetikos'% more interestingly, he provides an array of more or less weird data and lore which may (as) well be his own - Greek, Graeco-Roman, Italian, Roman - and makes the ensemble into a showcase of thinking about hunting within the history of classical culture.9 Lucretius and the Georgics are the chief extant influences on his writing (the poet knew all Virgil's work, as well as most of Ovid), but Grattius' project strikes out in a direction of its own. This poem has standardly been dissected as fumbled caniculars (doggerel) from a cackhanded poetaster,10 but that is only because no one could help him out of the manger of formalist trivialisation into which Latinists formerly insisted on tipping all but the sublime few of its texts: ars Grattia artis. 3. Today, people like me would like to be all about figuring out what our ancient Latin texts are 'all about': don't look and you won't find. Grattius gives ideal cover for chasing the politics of didactic, without distraction. Cultural history isn't going to catch up with him in a hurry, but he really does make a striking contribution to the normative discourse of the Roman √©lite in the middle years of Augustus' reign. His dog Latin is (we said) free from the diversions of patronal and panegyrical superstructure, from the biographical baggage of a genius' historicality; but the author-reader relations inscribed into the narration are actually what is on show here. In the name of a domain of culture, the text whistles up a mentality which revolves around its own regime of order. The subject of hunting models values of very general implication, as the poet treats topics which centre on dogged application and faithful attention, or run on canny experience and sustained habituation, evoking notions of propriety, prudence and pragmatism. That is, the subject shapes by reflex the subjectivity of its handler, and the handling of the reader implies and ordains terms for a sociality. If there were any such thing as a reader of Grattius, they would enter a world where the limits on human skill and invention alternately recede in the wake of progress and re-assert themselves through the myriad assaults of disease, defaults of nature, difficulties of programming success. The design of the work would communicate a rhythmic release of mood and modality where culture battles it out with its reflex, nature, only to be interrupted by 8 G. Curcio, 'Grazio poeta didattico', RFIC 26 ( 1 898) 55-69, at 67-9, sums up: 'nessuna relazione esiste fra i due trattati, perch√® probabilmente Grazio non conosceva l'opera dello storico greco'; cf. V. J. Gray, 'Xenophon's " Cynegeticus"' Hermes 1 13 (1985) 156-72 for Xenophon's happy hunting-ground, proud of his Spartan pack. H. Herter, 'Grattianum', RhM 78 (1929) 361-8 probes Posidonius' influence and posits that stand-by, the unknown Hellenistic source. (Did Nemesianus know Grattius? See Formicola (n. 2) 168-70, on vv. 298f.) 9 On the ticklish problem of the actual/notional/ideological valency of hunting at Rome: C. M. C. Green, 'Did the Romans hunt?', CA 15 (1996) 222-60. Villa facilities featured provision of game reserves for seigneurial shoots: Green (n. 7). 10 As still trotted out by the 'authentically and onomastically' dubbed N. Horsfall, 'An edition of Grattius', CR 39 (1989) 213-14, at 213, 'It is notably hard to define just how bad a poet G. is ...'. A jolly thumbs down from G. Pierleoni, 'Fu poeta Grattius?', RFIC 34 (1906) 580-97: 'io ritengo che, se Grattius fu dai Romani dimenticato, la colpa non fu tutta di chi lo dimentic√≤'.</page><page sequence="5">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 5 surprise vignettes of eulogy, moral declamation and pious prayer that weave their way in and out of the manual's instructions. Since hunting involves eugenics and phys- iognomies, dietary and mating rules, a ramifying nosology and pharmacopoeia, the analogical dimensions of Grattius' subject for figuring the dispensations of authority to the human pack thrust themselves forward. Truly, Grattius' performance represents a close reading of and from Augustan civil- isation. Survey the world at the feet of Rome - the head, he will boast, of the world - and you will see the canaille of tribes in all their ethnic/national/regional characteristics. The Hunt, he'll claim in so many words, is a suggestive conceptual melting-pot for imag(in)ing an imperial system. No, the volatility, fragility and madness of a hunting hound are not a (Hippolytan) paradigm for the colonialising universalism of the Julio- Claudian consciousness; but they are not not one, either. Know how a society treats, and writes, its dogs, and you can take it for a walk. 4. The ultimate subject here, then, is the production of the Augustan subject. The topic, however, is not hunting game but, rather, hunting to hounds. If this focussing is what Grattius and Grattius' construction of Augustanism are all about, what is that, can that be, to us? If that could be a question, then would this be my answer: an acceptable face for western anthropocentrism, no less - where dog don't eat dog? Now, conceptuali- sations of the place of humanity and inhumanity within the animate world always negotiate degrees of distance and association between man and other animal life-forms, and I mean to treat the Cynegetica as a prime instance. 1 1 In history, the institutions and discourse of Roman hunting were as likely to be engendered and refracted through the staged uenationes of the amphitheatre12 as by the gentleman's recreational 'shoot' in pursuit of his Hellenistic credentials as a proper member of the estate-owning, pseudo-officer class of toy cavalry riding down savage beasts of one sort or another;13 as close to the genteel art of verse dilettantism and banquet-room flooring as distant from any laborious countrified stalking for the pot, let alone outback hunter-gatherer subsistence. But the accounts of the chase that Roman gentry gave each other framed a conceptual topography for humankind none the less 11 See esp. T. Ingold, 'From trust to domination: an alternative history of human-animal relations', in A. Manning and J. Serpell (eds.) Animals and Human Society (London, 1994) 1-22, esp. 1, 'The story we tell in the West about the human exploitation and eventual domestication of animals is part of a more encompassing story about how humans have risen above, and sought to bring under control, a world of nature that includes their own animality.' Work such as K. Lorenz, Man Meets Dog (London, 1954), M. Leach, God Had a Dog (Princeton, 1961), and essays in M. H. Nitechi and D. V. Nitechi (eds.) The Evolution of Human Hunting (London, 1986) might make us sit up and beg. If - 12 See esp. S. Brown, 'Death as decoration: scenes from the arena on Roman domestic mosaics', in A. Richlin (ed.), Pornography and Representation in Greece and Rome (Oxford, 1992) 180-211, at 194-202, 'Animals against Men: Stronger vs. Weaker', 'Animals against Men: Equally Matched Opponents'. 13 See esp. J. Aymard, 'A propos de Grattius', RPh 12 (1938) 325-9, at 326f., with P.-J. Dehon, 'Horace et la chasse', Latomus 47 (1988) 830-3.</page><page sequence="6">6 JOHN HENDERSON for that. Suppose that the ideology of animal/human relations articulated in the armature of Grattius' Cynegetica can only become visible to a western eye/I once it loses axiomatic status as a banal truism. Then, reading his text might be 'all about' the uselessness of hoping that this ideo- logical complex will come into question, as it might if it were interrogated for the mix of types of basic attitude toward animals that it enshrines and that it would promulgate, for example by reference to the following grid: Naturalistic: Primary interest and affection for wildlife and the outdoors. Ecologistic: Primary concern for the environment as a system, for the interrelationships between wildlife species and natural habitats. Humanistic: Primary interest and strong affection for individual animals such as pets or large wild animals with strong anthropomorphic associations. Moralistic: Primary concern for the right and wrong treatment of animals, with strong opposition to the perceived overexploitation of and/or cruelty to animals. Scientistic: Primary interest in the physical attributes and biological functioning of animals. Aesthetic: Primary interest in the physical attractiveness and symbolic appeal of animals. Utilitarian: Primary interest in the practical values of animals, or in the subordination of animals for the practical benefit of people. Dominionistic: Primary interest in the mastery and control of animals. Negativistic: Primary orientation an active avoidance of animals due to dislike and fear. Neutralistic: Primary orientation a passive avoidance of animals due to indifference or lack of interest.14 Grattius does unearth ties between human/animal relations and political ideology: in particular, he clears a path for imperialist chauvinism by naturalising domination of the earth within the human jungle's struggle to be fittest. Does his reasoning merit more than oblivion? Give a dog a bad name ... 14 S. R. Kellert, 'Attitudes, knowledge and behaviour toward wildlife among the industrial superpowers: The United States, Japan and Germany', in Manning and Serpell (n. 11) 166-87, at 167. What a mess this diagnostic makes of our do-good postures.</page><page sequence="7">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 7 5. The opus opens - take it for granted that I'll take nothing for granted (except that you won't read Grattius) - with a sequence of exordia. The first philosophises grandly (vv. 1-23); the second works up close on some hunting gear (vv. 24-60): both from first principles. A third pronunciamento launches a busy salvo on the armaments of venery (vv. 61-74, prefacing 75-149), before all this is impatiently dismissed as swill delaying our initiation into dog-handling (vv. 150-496). A brief 'close-down with horses for hunting' seems to be promised, before the text prematurely runs ragged and tails off (vv. 497-541). 15 The first two verses emphatically twin artes | with armis |, and the pair of opening sequences intertwine, and pontificate about, parts of the hunter's panoply of 'equipment' and the repertoire of 'techniques' available to skill in using them. The first section winds up by underlining their combination as the poetic programme: carmine etarma dabo et uenandi pe rsequar artes (v. 23; arma x 20, ars x 17 in Cyneg.). If this seems to flag a pattern of the transcendence of 'arms' by supervenient 'expertise', in fact Grattius will extensively show that each invention of arms is grounded in skill, as its material precipitate and enabling pre-condition. What he says about the relation may, however, make a less ingrained impression on a reader than how it is instanced; and how performed. Leaving the first section aside for the moment, let me say how the text meant to rope readers in. It dives straight from polite invocation and urbane ratiocination into a skein of detailed particulars, calculated to string together a network of associated thoughts and wind up feelings. We are supposed to join in. The making of nets, and of their ropes, manufactures the poem's | armorum ... exordia (v. 24: cf. Cato, De Agr. 136, funem exordiri oportet). As we shall consider later, the exegesis entwines with its content,16 as Grattius shows precisely how to create 'from slender thread' twisted in four-ply a line that will be 'proof against wear and time' and then expertly urges 'pockets expansive enough to hold the largest prey, but not so ungrattiusly expensive as to hurt' ( tenui ...fdo, ... operum patiens, ... usus ... longi , v v. 25-7, si quisquam est plurimus ..., ingrati maiora impendia , vv. 30-3). 17 If the net is the hunter's equivalent of the farmer's plough, the instru/mental symbol of applied intelligence, Grattius insists, it is also already a secondary sophistication dependent on primary skills required to furnish the requisite materials (&lt; armamento 15 Grattius' horses (cf. A. Hyland, Equus: the horse in the Roman world (London, 1990) 150-4, 212, etc.) recap his lesson on, or with, dogs: gathering unto Rome the subjected world's stock of breeds, he curtly 'restricts his interest in them to hunting purposes' ( rest√¢t equos finire notis, quod arma Dianae ' admittant , vv. 497f.), where Virgil's horses double amateurishly between warhorse and chariot-team (W. Liebeschuetz, 'Beast and man in in the third book of Virgil's Georgics' G&amp;R 12 (1965) 64-77, at 65f. D. O. Ross, Jr., Virgil's Elements. Physics and Poetry in the Georgics (Princeton, 1987), esp. 150f., however, exposes the symbolic schema that links arma to armenta in Virgil, binding the binary war and peace). Indeed, before going out with a whimper, just as he gets to the Italian turf, Grattius may even rub this in: non omne meas genus audet in artes ... (v. 498). 16 Cf. Herter (n. 8) 368: Hor. Epp. 2.1.225, tenui deduc√≠a poemata filo. 17 Grattius knows the ropes better than most of us ever will, cf. F. Capponi, 'Il cassis ed i suoi poeti', Latomus 17 (1958) 669-86, J. A. Richmond, 'Ancient rope - Grattius 24-7', CQ 62 (1968) 380-1.</page><page sequence="8">8 JOHN HENDERSON operi , v. 48). So where do the fibres for the cables come from in the first place? Your guide can locate the best flax in a trice, and show you round the world's stock of good, bad, inappropriate, useless, labour-intensive but aptly high-strength crops, before exploring 'damp-proof conditions that threaten long life' ( non est umentibus usus in armis , ... tanto respondent longior usus , vv. 5 1 , 60). Patently, Cynegetica is underlining that these all-important nets depend on the combination of design in the abstract with well-selected raw components; but we also learn that both phases of the production- line require skilful management of resources, and many pitfalls demand caution along the way. Moreover, as the poet takes pains to get back behind the miracle of human craftwork to scrutinise the natural provision of resources, he makes this the opening he needs to lionise 'thoroughgoing carefulness: - the significance of poem and subject alike depend equally on this principle' (magnum opus et tangi , nisi cura uincitur , impar , v. 61: an early construal, or denial, of Georg. 1.145f., labor omnia uicit ' improbus ).18 6. In the facetious editorial he lets himself run on into, before the next lesson, Grattius briskly valorises his own epic pretensions with traditional scorn for the neanderthal subjects of mythological epic, giants lumbering through the jungle without their copies of Grattius,19 heroes hunting-casualties, heavily armed or not. Abruptly facing about, he then appropriates Hercules' legendary hunting scalps to glamorise his game (vv. 62-72).20 He means to show that 'grattiusness is the pay-off of his poetic skill, sc. his skill at conveying hunting skill' (si qua meis respondei ab artibus , ... gratia , vv. 73f.). The object, he promises, is 'to trick brutes' strength, by providing powerful hardware' (uires fallai ...ferinas ..., non parua facultas ..., satis armorum est , vv. 74, 76, 78). Stinking feathers, for example! Correctly arranged feathers along a line, that is (= the formido ), will scare game toward waiting huntsmen. Or, again, take trip-wire traps, and sprung snares ... Still tricking out its nets, Cynegetica brings on its own authority- figure, saluting for its 'featured culture-hero' (not Hercules, but one) Derkulos of Arcadia, who once spread his nets near Sparta, and 'was blessed by Diana to spread the word to mankind', and so to prefigure our unheeded guru Grattius (auctorem ... operi dignata inscribere magno , ... suas etpandere gentibus artes , vv. 1 06f . ; cf. v. 14). As well as pioneering those 'tricksy weapons' we just noticed (dissimulantibus armis , v. 93), Derkulos saw how to 'strengthen' hunting-spears for power, and for safety in 'dealing with kamikaze beasts' (ualido ... dente , ... omne ... excepit onus , v v. 108-10). Others have taken his ideas further, along the same lines ... But beware fashion, which either overdoes or underdoes shaft or head, and learn that 'moderation always makes the best missiles' (v. 121). And, in getting javelins sorted, don't leave Diana's arms behind, for 'flying arrows can add up to a hunting epic' (magnum opus et uolucres quondam f ecere sagittae, v. 126). 18 Cf. A. Loupiac, 'Le labor chez Virgile: essai d'interpr√©tation', REL 70 (1993) 92-106. 19 This is an absurdist twist to the prooemial recusatio of Gigantomachy, for which you should cf. P. R. Hardie, Virgil's Aeneid: Cosmos and Imperium (Oxford, 1986) 87 and nn. 6-7. 20 Hercules' 'conquest' of the beasts is thoroughly satirised by Lucretius (5.22-36).</page><page sequence="9">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 9 7. This memo proves to spur Grattius' second tracking of an item of equipment back to its natural materials: how to pick a strong shaft? The cosmopolitan eye surveys the Roman world's store, for plenty, variety, quality, and labour-intensiveness, then scrupulously feeds instructions for training and cutting successfully straight javelins; which is to say, the writer studies the Roman literary store, and strips Virgil's poetic wood (esp. Georg. 2.1 10-35 ~ Cyneg. 127-39, with uirga Sabaeis |, 132 quoting 1 17; and 138f., sponte sua ... curua- ... genistae | quoting 1 If.). Although this section will be impatiently discarded as 'minor detail obstructing the main business', dogs (vv. 150f.), this should throw no (hypothetical) reader off the scent. The lessons learned through the instances of net and spear are valuable. And they preinforce the main course to come, the essay on hounds. The repetition drives the thinking home - and boosts the game of role-playing between bright pupil and wisened teacher. 8. The opening lines of the poem caught at our goodwill by revving up the poem's impetus, but at the same time by doling out 'good cheer' from the outset ( laetas ). Proems must always decoy critical response. What would we make of the inaugural dedication to Diana , who echoes through the programme: | Dona cano diuum ... (vv. 1-2) ? As he recounts, Grattius' song of 'divine gifts of skill wins her blessing', for in the operation of recounting he repeats 'the founding moment in which god blessed hunting with skills' ( dona ... diuum , ... artes , ƒº auspicio ... tuo ; ... prim≈Øm auspicium deus artibus ... dedit, vv. lf., 10f.). Diana's 'aid protected primeval humanity', and her entourage of hunting-gods will now 'guard the poet's defence of humankind with his song/spell' ( uitam protegere auxiliis' his ... praesidibus nostram defendere sortem ... non sine carmine , vv. 14, 2 If.; cf. 8). This carapace of pious puffery, however, shares attention with the triumphant 'teleology' of 'Reason', which 'taught humanity to learn how to graft one skill onto another' and 'save the world' (te sociam , Ratio ...; ex artibus artes ' proserere' ... tetigitque industria finem ; orbem ... soluere , vv. 6, 8f., 12, 15). So philosophy provides the didaxis with a suitably managerial aura for its mission statement.21 Poetry begins to weld content ('hunting operations') to vehicle ('the writing of Cynegetica ': opus x 21, in all), finding metapoetic images for its own project. Thus the hunter's net is a miraculous whole spun from space graphically framed by every 'line' (linea) - 'tautened', as we were taught, 'to take the strain of a poet's output into aeons of fame' (vv. 25-7). His emblematic spear interacts dialectically with it, as projectile to receptor, object to structure, point to grid. The technology 'in' the spear clearly represents very different mentation: there is 'heavy investment of craftsmanship' (multo ...ficta labore , v. 136), and 'its product is a trajectory lined up straight at the stars' ( uirgae , v. 143). 21 See esp. Effe (n. 2) 154f. I have not seen A. De Vivo, 'Il proemio del Cynegeticon liber di Grattio', in C. Santini and N. Scivoletto (eds.), Prefazioni, prologhi, proemi di opere tecnico-scientifiche latine II (Rome, 1992) 749-65.</page><page sequence="10">10 JOHN HENDERSON Crucially, it achieves 'noble sublimity' through the severe pruning of skilfully-selected raw material. The poem verbally enacts this artistry behind the arma , for - hey presto! - 'shear sprouting suckers' spells, exactly, 'cut sparkling verses' (gemmantis exige uersus, 144: cf. Georg. 4.144, in uersum = 'in rows, for an orchard of verse'). Here, in Cyneg. 142-4, post ubi proce≈Ñs gene rosam stirpibus arbos ' se dederit teretisque f e rent ad sidera uirgae ' str√¨nge notas circum et gemmantis exige uersus , Grattius parades quotation from Georg. 2.368-70, inde ubi iam ualidis amplexae stirpibus ulmos / exierint , tum str√¨nge comas , tum bracchia tonde: ' ante reformidatferrum ; tum denique dura exerce imperia et ramos compesce fluentis. Which is to say, the poet in him reflexi vely accentuates and parades the intertextual operations of literariness. On the grandest scale of all, rhetoric will build seething narration of the global pack into the definitive syntagm of the Cynegetica. This grat extravaganza of antithesis and rhyme gathers something like epic energy, stretching amplificatory totalisation clear across the text it dominates. 9. Imagery pictures prehistoric progress toward culture as itself a 'hunt' for success, eventually grasped through the discovery of hunting techniques: 'before, life consisted in getting "lost"; later, a second expedition took the inside line and fetched along Reason as assistant for the enterprise' ( error ..., alia propiore uia ..., te sociam ... sumpsere , vv. 2-6; cf. qua propior peteret uia ... unus praesidium atque operi spes magna petito ' adsumptus metagon , vv. 218-21). But what is this reasoning that keys the poem all about? The humans who once upon a time combed the woods reliant on bare courage and on 'weapons' alone ( armis , v. 2: were their 'muscles', armi , the original armai) were non-human in their 'lack of reasoning' ( inconsulti , v. 4). Later, homo sapiens was self-realised in 'the enlightenment that revealed the straight path of order', when 'constructive learning' took off and 'crazed violence fell away' (vv. 7-9). Yet this beatified alliance of gods and men strictly depends on the axiom that proto- hominids needed 'saving from the affliction' of 'a life terrorised by war with wild animals' ( trepidam bello uitam ... ferino , orbemque hac soluere noxa , vv. 13-15). So the entire apparatus of enculturation is laid at the door of hunting defined as 'defence of the human condition against myriad species of wild animals' (praesidibus nostram defendere sortem ' contra mille feras, vv. 21-3). This is the banner under which Grattius will array the weapons and techniques of hunting. Our very first glimpse of the hunt spoke of it as bellum, in the phrase 'all hope rested on weapons' (e.g. Sail. Bell. lug. 14.10, Liv. 32.23.5). The Cynegetica never stops brandishing a posited state of 'war' as the natural relationship between people and animals. All the poem's cultural apparatus of arma and artes targets 'wild beasts' to this day. So 'phobia' grounds and motivates 'help, assistance, protection, defence, guardianship'; and is at once the raison ƒèetre for such advanced bibliotherapy as the Cynegetica, and the determinant of its literary genre as an epic of arma. The hunter nets, not fauna, but 'the enemy' ( hostem , v. 30, cf. 45, etc., etc.). Our Faliscan flax is 'unfit for active service' ( imbellia lina, v. 40) and the White Hunter Hercules is invoked</page><page sequence="11">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 1 1 as 'culture-hero of a wild world' ( cultor ... feri ... orbis , v. 69). Huntsmen use 'the display of terror' ( terribilis species = metus , vv. 79, 85, 88), they 'trick and ambush' (fraus ... insidias , v. 91), and prepare 'bite to maximise potential for damage' ( dentatas ..., dente ..., proni uulneris ..., uerutis dentibus ..., totis ... ensibus ..., hƒç cessarei iners in uulnere massa ferino , dentes ..., aƒá /ƒçmƒç uulnus eat , w. 92, 108-13, 1 18, 123). In effect, the preliminary 'arming-scenes' have kitted out this 'retiarian' epic, with net and spear, in readiness for action once the troops muster for their catalogue: 'the top priority responsibility is for dogs, whether you are running down an indomitable foe with full vigour, in naked military aggression, or conducting a tactical war' (... siue ind√≥mitos uehementior hostes | nudo marte premas seu bellum ex arte ministres , w. 152f.).22 10. This Iliadic conflict in dogdom launches 'a thousand ... pups' {mille canum patriae , v. 154).23 To the eye of a connoisseur of those antithetical pairings ordained by the Roman arena to figure the ends of Empire, warrior hounds clearly replicated, with some wildly paradoxical displacements, the 'ethnic temperaments' that were supposed to characterise human fighters ( ducti ... ab origine mores , v. 154) - 'Medes are a rabble, just right for major sorties, Celts a horde of soloists transfigured by mega kudos' {magna indocilis dat proelia Medus ' magnaque diuersos extollit gloria Celtas , vv. 155f.); 'Geloni refuse the fray, but are smart: Persians at your service either way; Tibetans go berserk and out of control, Lycaonians are easily managed, yet heroically built' (vv. 157-60: ... magni ... armis , 160 - vs. arma , 158 - rubs it in that these mastiff soldiers are indeed 'armed bodies', cf. v v. 274, 471). Hyrcanines, though, fetch in genetic stiffening from the wild, crossing themselves with tigers to manufacture 'pelimeli courage ..., mighty battlers, they're worth all their embarrassing bloodiness to civvies, back at barracks' (vv. 161-70); whereas Umbrians are expert scouts, but run from the enemy (vv. 171-4). British bulldogs do lousy turn-out on parade, 'but when the epic episode for aristeia arrives and pelimeli War calls in a desperate crisis', you'll admire Molossians less (... at magnum cum uenit opus promendaque uirtus ' et uocat extremo praeceps discrimine Mauors ... , vv. 1 74-8 1 ). Et cetera ... And now the moment has arrived to underscore all the implicit rhyming between canine and hominid performance - with the first of Spartan Cynegetica 's brace of similes -: sicut Acarnanes subie runt proelia furto , | sic canis illa suo s taciturna superuenit hostes (v v. 1 84f.). The logic firmly inculcated (like dog, like master), the lecture can now turn to the next topic, of specialised techniques for utilising these natural resources. 22 I am indebted to the anon, reader for drawing attention to this point; this writing does what it says. 23 J.

Cynegetics, we learn, wage 'WAR, across the world' ( magnum opus). Recce 'the enemy', then, in this War on the Wild: something very big to net (a giant ... hare?); Thessalian bear; Adonis and Ovid's Ancaeus slain (by boar);24 Hercules triumphant over the planet's zoo 'across an Odyssey of ocean and land, plus Hades' gateway (scene of ... his dogfight with the hellhound Cerberus)' ; fearful stags, and other kinds of, ahem, 'monster' ( belua ); a thing enraged by a wound, something heavyweight (vv. 30, 49, 66f., 69-72, 85, 88, 109f.) ... Such is the terrifying foe against whom the myriad battalions of braves have been marshalled for the fray. The intimidatory levy rendez- vouses wave after wave of offensive might. Whose blood will they bay for? Ranged against them will be: scented boar; the 'unepic saga' ( leue ... opus) of terrorising antelope, or beagling diminutive hare; lions can be pulled down by thoes (- but this is 'the best known of stories , a myth': clar√≠ssima fama) (vv. 186, 199-201, 256f.). Whatever ferae demand all the heroism Grattius can muster, and (unless the patching up is just for wear and tear on the road) something must have 'wounded' all the hounds we must treat ( Mauortia bello ' uulnera , vv. 344f.) - not least that unspecified 'foe whose urine you need to grab, and apply to the wound it inflicted' (vv. 354-6: a tall enough order, this 'hair of the dog'), - they are nevertheless steadfastly withheld from our inspection. (Grattius' mounts will face no adversaries, or targets. None at all.) Lurking in their jungle lairs where we must hound them down, these hostes (remember) are supposed to call for divine protection, aid, and defence from the team of Diana and her hierophant Grattius (vv. 13-22, cf. 99). Cynegetica even pretended to roll on its 'thousand' breeds of dog, in order to match 'a thousand' feral threats to survival (vv. 22, 154, 479: cf. Virg. Aen. 7. 338, | mille nocendi artes). For sure, if comparison of hunt with war makes hunt come over all comical, then comparison of war with hunt tips satirical mockery all over war. Representation of the ritual histrionics of massed attack on game must always have a dimension, at least, of exhibitionist/voyeurist false consciousness; the barbarous obscenity of war is always being massaged when it trades on the fresh air sports of hue and cry ... So The Hunt is a phoney war that never took place, and this apologist must pour divine unction onto a myth projected away onto the blank of prehistory. There he can pull off his Indian rope trick and kid us all that nature red in tooth and claw threatens our survival. See how the gaze of didactic nostalgia constitutively effaces the very distance that, so it means to teach, cultural didaxis has itself opened up between the mythic origin and the present context of our backward look.25 No. It is the pack that monopolises attention, because it is the hunter's cynosure. This is not war, but ludic domination of nature. This nexus of power/knowledge takes what grows wild, and breeds, then cross-breeds, it, in a ceaseless and boundless drive for mastery, through technological engineering, tool-making, proliferating techniques, and experiment with eco-resources, both animal and vegetable, in the global laboratory. 24 Cf.

Sweet Reason was mobilised to condemn the 'savagery' of sylvan nature for the crime of eluding human control.27 To charter and beatify the separation of humanity from animality, Grattius turns the god in man on the beasts most thoroughly appro- priated for human utilisation and re-programmed through the ages in accordance with the demands of human imagination. All dogs sanctify the human power to re-fashion nature, as these prodigiously teachable social creatures have provided optimal subjects for socialisation from of old, learning, precisely, new tricks, including response to human language as order and encouragement.28 But not every Hund is a hound. These hunting-dog fighting-machines are the handiwork of play-god bio-imperialism. Cynegetics are cybernetics, they engineer brutalised animate docility: haec tua militia est ... (v. 344) 12. Grattius' first words signalled Virgilian epic (dona cano diuum , v. 1 ~ arma uirum cano , Aen. 1.1); but his first line also promenaded that quotation from the Georgics opening ( laetas ~ laetas). We readers of Virgil must always come at the oeuvre with hindsight, aware that the heroes' Homeric arma that founded Rome (p)re-figured the arma of the farmer's Hesiodic equipment (dicendum et quae sint duris agrestibus arma , Georg. 1.160). Grattius' catalogue of guardian angels of the hunt soon stresses his affinity with Ge√≥rgica , as he re-points the invocation catechism (vv. 16-20 ~ Georg. 1.16-20; 'Nymphs in three figures' from Georg. 4.382f.). Readers would see that Grattius presents his work as at once a filial expansion of an aspect of country life that The Poet's work merely glanced at. Hunting is just one of the various artes pioneered by usus (1.133, 140: inuentum et magnos canibus circumdare saltus , 145), a winter pastime (tum gruibus pedicas et retia ponere ceruis ' auritosque sequi lepores, turn figere dammas , 1.307f.), and handled in its own right only as a minor component of farm husbandry.29 Virgil dwells on horses and cattle, giving just ten-line sketches of sheep for wool, goats for milk, and then dogs, sheepdogs and hunting-dogs in one (3.384-93, 394-^-03, 404-13: canibus leporem, canibus uenabere dammas ...).30 26 Cf. S. H. Lonsdale, 'Attitudes towards animals in ancient Greece', G&amp;R 26 (1979) 146-59, at 153f. 27 Cf. Ingold(n. 11) l^L 28 D. F. Armstrong, W. C. Stokoe, S. E.

Connor, 'The Georgics as description: aspects and qualifications', in Boyle (n. 25) 34-58, at 50f. Grattius thus anticipates Columella's supplement of the book on flowers Virgil left to be written ( Res Rust. 10. praef. 3, after Georg. 4. 147f.); though he comes across, perhaps, more like a didactic equivalent of Calpurnius Siculus' emulous bucolic. 30 Cf. M. C. J. Putnam, Virgil's Poem of the Earth. Studies in the Georgics (Princeton, 1979) 211,213.</page><page sequence="14">14 JOHN HENDERSON Where Virgil confutes his own rubric by 'caring for dogs l(e)as≈• - as his preceptor Varro had also done, but had so proclaimed, not disavowed ( nec tibi cura canum fue rit postrema ..., 3.403; relinquitur ...de quadripedibus quod ad canes attinet ..., Res Rust. 2.9.1) -, Grattius will theatrically push aside those opening presentations of arma , (neither the farmer's plough and crops of Georgie I, nor the arboriculture of Georgie II, but) the hunter's nets and flax, or hemp, then his spear shaft and its woodcraft, in favour of his real project, the pack of hounds, with a corrective flourish of disrespect: prima ilia canum , non ulla per artes ' cura prior ... (vv. 15 If.). Nor could a Grattius ever confuse sheepdog with hunting hound, emphatically kept apart by the expert Varro (Res Rust. 2.9.2 : the genus uenaticum bracketed). Now Virgil cued in his cameo on dogs with the advance details that Saharan herdsmen hump their armaque Amyclaeumque canem on their backs (3.345), whereas at the other extreme Steppe winters freeze game, so Scyths hunt non immissis canibus, non cassibus ullis, ' puniceaeue ...formidine pennae (37 1 f., re-worked by Cyneg. 85-8); and he soon goes on to list dogs among the side-victims of his Norie cattle plague (canibus blandis rabies uenit , 496), their caninity entirely perished (dammae ceruique fugaces I nunc inter.... canes ... uagantur, 539f.). Careful study of Georgics III, Virgil's gospel on livestock, would show Grattius that dogs featured also in the chaos brought to the animal kingdom by amor (265). How suggestive it would be that Virgil's eventual paragraph on dogs leads at once into an infestation of foul snake- venom (414-39), ushering in the sequence on diseases (from 440, | morborum ... causas et signa docebo ...: after Lucr. 6.1090, 1 138), which oozes contagiously, for all the anticipatory culling that can be urged and tried, into the catastrophic ruination of the Norie cattle-plague that takes the book on out (440-556 ~ Cyneg. 344-496). Cynegetica may fairly be said to recapitulate, not just the entire domain of the Georgics in general, but specifically the ensemble of the third book, whose content-list he follows, in a sense, even more faithfully than does his master, its author (uocat ... Cithaeron ' Taygetique canes domitrixque Epidaurus equorum ' et uox adsensu nemorum ingeminata remugit , 3.43-5). 'Hounds, then horses', we note, the perfect formula for human/animal relations: master and servants (fidelissimum ... ante omnia homini canis atque equus , Plin. Nat. Hist. 8.61). Virgil's opening gusto on the points of good horses or cattle, followed by careful preparations for servicing, protection of whelping bitches, fostering of young, and their early training for specific functions (Georg. 3.49-208 ~ Cyneg. 260-306, | iunge pares , 263 quoting 169 in poetic lusus ),31 leads up to explosion into the cosmic fall-out of amor through all the realm of the animate. Grattius' catalogue of dog-breeds leads, from the Hyrcanian bitch mating herself with a tiger (vv. 161-70), into the topic of breeders' crossing of the different hounds, sparked off by reflection on the 'pluses and minuses' of yapping Aetolian dogs (uariis miscebo gentibus usum , vv. 186-94). Between further examples, there 31 For the seamless montage of these topics, cf. Putnam (n. 30) 174f.</page><page sequence="15">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 1 5 intervenes a second emblematic passage (√† la Aristaeus, Georg. 4.3 15), where a certain Hagnon (grattiously hymned by hunters so long as the poem - standing in for the Capitol - survives: plurima semper ' gratia ..., semper eris, dum carmina dumque manebunt ' ... arma Diania , vv. 215f., 25 If.) is feted for devising a better way to cope with highspeed prey than merely to pick swift varieties. Hagnon invented the - proto- typically Glympic (v. 214: never heard of the Glympics?) - new-fangled metagon , or 'tracker-dog', that goes out on the leash, well before the noonday sun. One man and his dog, specially trained up for all the ins and outs of this sophisticated work.32 But, to rejoin the argument, divinely blessed Hagnon was also a breeder. He bred a cross from those thoes - a customised superdog-fox-hound, said (we saw) to take on lions and win (vv. 253-62). This is the moment for Grattius to play Virgil in the doghouse: pick out points for sire and dam of your tracker-hound; carefully prepare for grattious mating (v. 266); protect pregnant bitches; after a cull, foster the litter. Dietary strictures at once enlarge to take in all humanos ... sensus , as we, or at any rate I, shall soon explore. But for now let us register that in Latin 'caring' always spells 'cure' as well as 'care' (cura).33 Hounds' wounds must be seen to, and infection must be prevented from oozing conta- giously through the pack to introduce that catastrophic ruination, rabid whelps: to anticipate that, anything should be tried - de- 'worming' tongues,34 or competing for most bizarre amulet (badgers' tufts on the collars to ward off the evil-eye, and whatever next?). Like Virgil's sheep, hounds get mange ( scabies , 1 .441 ~ v. 409): culling is again the tough remedy, steel yourself and repeat the mantra 'one for all' (1.468f. ~ v v. 410-12); though if there is a chance to try some veterinary science, either there is bathing (1.445-7 ~ v. 418), or there are various salves (medicata bitumina ..., | Hipponiasque pices neglectaeque unguen amurcae |, vv. 415f., citing tristi ... amurca I ... I Idaeasque pices ..., unguine ..., nigrumque bitumen , 3.448-51). 35 Where Virgil plunges into doom, Cynegetica goes upbeat, proactively snatching 'gracious outcomes' from the jaws of perdition (gratos ... fines , v. 429). Grattius wants to take someone decent and clean, for the cure, to his magical version of the cave of Proteus which hosts the finale of the Fourth Georgie (est in Trinacria specus ingens ..., v. 430 quotes est specus ingens ..., 4. 418). Virgil's pastor Aristaeus went off to beg resurrection for his swarm; dog-handlers can beg the god of fire for relief from bane such as tetanus, and get succour. Or (to conclude), since there are myriad ailments, and 32 For Grattius' (otherwise unattested) metagon as a function, not a specific breed, cf. D. R. Shackleton- Bailey, 'Notes on minor Latin poetry', Phoenix 32 (1978) 311-15, at 314 (with Aymard (n. 23) 257-61). 33 Cf. A. Schiesaro, 'Il destinatario discreto.

This is how Grattius' kennels make sure to drop anyone still there reading where they came in, in with the goddess, 'whether our priority care is triumph over the woods or evasion of the bane and threat of deathstiny' (| cura prior ..., v. 496, quoting v. 152 in boldly affirmed ring-structure). Reason, as I shall explain very shortly, takes a back seat as that pious invocation, which I wrote off as an urbane carapace of pious puffery , in the event gets the part of deus ex machina : the destination was, all along, tua magna fides tutelaque Virgo | (v. 496). 1 3. Now Grattius also 'read through' Virgil to his inspiration in Lucretius for the Third Georgie ,36 and waved the fact at readers by some more conspicuous citation in his proem. | te sociam, Ratio , rebus sumpsere gerendis (v. 6) forcibly corrects | te sociam studeo scribendis uersibus esse ( DRN 1.24). 37 Grattius calms the enlistment of Venus genetrix for the writing-project, substituting a report on the progress long since accom- plished by reason. (Lucretius will falsely bid his 'cur' Memmius to apply ears and sagacity ueram ad rationem , 1.50f.) Of course Grattius could also reflect on the difference to the cynegetic cosmology that its antecedents in agricultural didactic and Epicurean philosophy could make; and so could we, if we read him. The point to grasp right now is that Grattius' poetic of extrapolation from Virgil's gaps to a compacted extension of his work is a strategy of sidestepping that most faithfully emulates his model's own procedure. For Lucretius had as good as pointed to a site for further development in parallel with his own project in the course of his grand finale, the re-presentation he himself offers of Thucydides' human plague of Athens. Lucretius all but predestines a Ge√≥rgica to come: consimili ratione uenitbubus quoque saepe ' pestilitas et iam pig ris balantibus aegror ( DRN 6.1 13 If.). He reinforces the signal, too, as if to infect Virgil's thoughts: nullo cessabant tempore apisci ' ex aliis alios auidi contagia morbi , | lan√≠geras tamquam pecudes et bucera saecla (6.1235-7). More specifically, Grattius read 'through' Virgil's re-casting for Noricum of Lucretius' notice that at Athens cum primis fida canum uis ' strata uiis animam ponebat in omnibus aegre (6.1222L: tailpiece to his ten-line feature on animals, these mutts the only victims glimpsed suffering), which itself injected pathos into Thucydides' original remark o√≠ √¥√® x√∫ve√ß 'iƒÅXkov aƒ´a0iƒºoiv jtaQeixov to√µ ajto√üaivovxog √¥i√† x√≤ ^uv√¥iaix√¢oGai ... (2.50.2: on eating contagious victims). Virgil picked up on Lucretius' shot of innocent suffering.38 That sick vignette he came up with, canibus bland√≠s rabies uenit (Georg. 3.496), was provocation for a 36 Cf.

How would a dog's eye-view alter the change of perspective that Virgil's cattle-farmer brought with him to The Plague? The tradition of teaching with the terror of plague had shifted from diagnosis of the collapse of a political order, to psychic ordeal-cwm-parable of the order of mortality,39 to metaphorised melt-down of animality ... - what next? 14. At the structural level, Grattius could home in on Virgil's synthetic decoction, within the span of Georgie III, of Lucretius' entire epic project. He might incorporate the rhythm of bipartite division with programmatic prooemia, a central climax with the topic of sex, diagrammed against death in the finale of the plague.40 Brought out all the more clearly for the difference within such parallelism, Grattius' own decoction of the Ge√≥rgica within his (almost extant) laconic monobiblos accentuates everything differently. If dogs are like other domesticated animals, as they are for selection, breeding, tending and feeding, still they are uniquely alarming in sickness. Always (or until we drove our cannibalised cows mad as us), the scourge of rabies has trounced the field, with sheep and their scabies a poor second. (Bad enough to start wars, cf. Virg. Aen. 7.479-95, subitam canibus rabiem ...) Virgil had agonised over the inefficacy of human efforts to aid his farmyard of immuno-deficiency. He had articulated an epidemic that levelled all living creation like nothing on earth bar the imperative to mate. He had envisioned sex and decimation as the polar extremes where vitality will not come to heel.41 His totalised Evil beggars all the caring/curative labour the teacher can drill into existence,42 until we face the despair where kindness only kills,43 where what has helped only tortures,44 where 'inadequate technique aggravates infection' (... quae- sitaeque nocent artes , 3.549). Grattius, for his part, disowns any such view of The End. He gobbles up despair, in rhythmic waves of decisive intervention, through points of triumph and set-back. He turns steadily and not always stealthily toward his trump card of pietism. His strategy is, we could put it, to incorporate into a job description what Lucretian logic had implacably seized on for the non-negotiable other of human life. Lucretius 39 Cf. esp. D. F.

He finds us the final reason to reason.45 To gaze on futility, the underside of purposive effort, Virgil - however momentarily - buries the boundaries between the animals.46 He shows the abyss risked by human ambition to direct life on earth.47 Grattius, by contrast, contains epidemiology within his medicine chest, and chants from his book of spells. He does know despair, but battles on nonetheless. Yes, the man to see about a dog does share the rationalism of Lucretius' satirical sanity, and, yes, he does share some of the humanism of the Virgilian farmer's anthropocentricity; but he models a very different mind-set, and he services a very different cultural politics. 15. Texts have meanings in relation to other texts: but classic texts and their trailing epigoni work dialectically with other texts, too, not least as synecdochic construais of the Texts' of historicality. Lucretius' ending with the plague of Athenian democracy must mark the beginning of psychic resistance to the incipient collapse of the Roman republic: his text breaks off where Thucydides moves on, away from the coacervation of corpses, to mark the defoliation of social morality in the polity (jtq√¥jt√≥v tb f 'qƒ∂e xal √®√ß x√†kXa tQ Jt√≥√Äei √®m JtX√©ov √†vop√≠a√ß x√≤ voorƒºƒºia ..., 2.53.1, cf. 47. 2f., 54.1). Virgil's temporary ending with the cattle plague marked the historical moment of an emergent cultural order from the nadir of civil war undifference at Actium (to be continued). We know we have a book more of bones to pick with Virgil before we need turn to re-read (our only option on Lucretius' Epicurean curriculum of palin-genesis). After the downward plunge of Georgie III, dousing us with the napalm of contagion, IV duly serves up a hive of 'micro-activity to contemplate on the humdrum front of the farmer's/poet's round of chores' - business as usual, that is to say, and another chance to shore up morale against whatever the future may hold ( admiranda tibi leuium spectacula rerum ... in tenui labor ; at tenuis non gloria ..., 4.3-6). Grattius learned, not least through this feint from Virgil, how he meant to teach the learning of political morality from a World of Nature curriculum. This is what he did. Half-way, he warned us not to spoil our litter of pups with fancy grub. From there, he bolts into open analogical diatribe against human indulgence. He lambasts the way of life (uita = √¥√≠aixa) that 'eats' (sic) 'into human experience, unless reason eliminates it and grasps the nettle before weaknesses arrive' (vv. 310f.). What is this 'all about'? Where Virgil would tentatively 'dubitate on presumptuousness' (si parua licet componere magnis , 4. 176), his successor presumes to reverse the lesson of right living 45 Cf. C. Segal, Poetry and Philosophy in De Rerum Natura (Princeton, 1990) 235. 46 Cf. esp. Gale (n. 40) 418. One carnivore's beefburger is another carnivore's dogfood in today's conta- minated foodchain. 47 Miles (n. 41 ) 223 argues that 'for Virgil, as for Lucretius and Thucydides, disease and plague, however disruptive they may be, are not anomalous intrusions into the workings of the universe but are a part of them. As a consequence they offer a vivid warning of man's limited ability to impose his own order on nature.' Has A.I. D.S. given such rationalisation a thrashing? The band plays on.</page><page sequence="19">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 1 9 in accordance with nature48 and ' deduce from the grand socio-political truth of Augustus' cultural order how to moderate his mini-universe' (, scilicet exiguis magna sub imagine rebus ' prospicies quae sit ratio et quo fine regendae , vv. 326f.). Grattius teaches anyone out there who may be in range to learn to manage their lives as if fighting the good fight for Rome. Frankly, but not prosaically, he positions himself as docile Augustan subject convinced by the fall of the 'Ptolemaic dynasty beaconed across the world' ( Pharios ... reges , v. 312). He snarls that Cleopatra's line was demoralised by excess, as were the Lydia of Herodotus' Croesus and degenerate Greece before them, eventually deposed by the Roman heroes immortalised by epic and history ('Camilluses', v. 321 : from Georg. 2. 169, and/or 'you, o Serranus', v. 322: from Aen. 6.844). Augustan Rome knew in its bones the ideology that encoded the moralised politics of subjection to the princip√°te in the abjection of the unnatural regality of a Pharaoh. The need to repulse Parthian encroachment via Armenia at the interface between West and East cast them as the recycled 'Achaemenids' their Arsacid dynasty bragged of being, and Romans could comfort themselves with the hope that the fall of a Xerxes is sure to unravel the rise of any Cyrus (e.g. Sail. Bell. Cat. 2.2). The triumphalism of world conquest was best codified in Aeneid VI' s roll-call of heroes, who teach the true artes of Rome, at the expense of Hellenic civilisation (hae tibi e runt artes |, Aen. 6.852 ~ tu ... luxuriae fictas ... colligis artes |, Cyneg. 318). These were the truths that Romans were (supposed) to live as the core of their cultural didaxis, eternally (post-)Augustan, for as long as Rome bossed the planet and apotheosised her exempla , called from the plough to ... Jupiter's table.49 Any resemblance of Grattius to Virgil's mythic patriarch and originator of Roman didaxis Anchises was precisely intended: for the grand march-past review of the soldier citizens who have built, and are to build, the eternal Empire lets slip just what Grattius has in mind for his catalogued dogs of war. 16. Cynegetica , as we insisted, sees its business as war: ayaGrj yap JCoX√©pou √¥i√¥√°axa^o√ß r' 0f|Qa.50 Al preparations for a pukka shoot have always outlined a mannequin for imperialism, at least from Rome to the Raj. Grattius' proem decoyed us with The Hunt's charter myth of prehistoric fight for survival. Grattius demonstrably pondered Lucretius' narrative of the rise of culture, where the first hominids hunted other beasts in the woods manuum mira f reti uirtute pedumque ( DRN 5.965, ~ Cyneg. 3, nuda ... uirtute ), but took to the caves and hills before boar or lion, far more likely 48 Bolt down A. Wallace-Hadrill, 'Pliny the Elder and man's unnatural history', G&amp;R 37 (1990) 80-96, esp. 85-90, for the normative function of luxury in the imperial discourse on proper ordering of behaviour - and thought. 49 Cf. J. Henderson, Figuring out Roman Nobility: Juvenal's Eighth Satire (Exeter, 1997). Lucretius' Athens risen ad summum ... cacumen | (5.1457) yields to Virgil's rerum facta ... pulcherrima Roma (Georg. 2.534), and is thrashed by Cyneg. 324f., orbi Romam caput ..., ad caelum ... summosque ... honores.

This replaced the original body arma of feral 'hands-nails/claws-teeth' (manus ungues dentesque , 1283). So Kill or be Killed was the primal contract - obsolete as the dodo, ever since fire handed homines the edge in their bellum siluestre, in their longing either to till, or to kill rich prey (1245-9). In time, the larger species would be pressed into the service of Man as smart weapons of war ( 1 308^19). 52 In short, arms dominate Lucretius' theory of the technology race. In this light, Grattius' hounds show up as crack troops in a 'heroic' standing 'army' (ex ercitus ingens , v. 370). They must, however, scour the outback if they are to locate an 'enemy'. They can produce no credible threat to neutralise. Rather, they hold wargame jamborees, and call it 'defence of the realm'. In short, the poet lectures us, the pack incarnates the living traditions of Roman militarism (vv. 326-4-4). These prove to be more strictly Augustan than you would readily believe (even if you did make the mistake, somehow, of reading Grattius for yourself).53 17. Virgil's farming communities knew groups of keepers ( maƒ£istri , Georg. 3.445, 549). But Grattius comes at once to the point, with the system of administration he would (have you) put in place: idcirco imperium catulis unusque magister additur: ille dapes poenamque operamque &lt;moramque&gt; temperet, hune spectet siluas domitura iuuentus. 330 nec uile arbitrium est: quoicumque haec regna dicantur, ille tibi egregia iuuenis de pube legendus, utrumque et prudens et sumptis impiger armis . quod nisi et accessus et agendi tempora belli nouerit et socios tutabitur hoste minores, 335 aut cedent aut illa tarnen uictoria damnost ... Chief of Staff empowered to command undivided loyalties; magisterial and censorial sumptuary prescription, judicial control, regulation of employment, recreational discipline ...; the pick of the √©lite, and in the pink; that ideal compound of cool head + military aggression; percentage strategy, minimised risk ... 51 Cf.

Henderson, 'Fighting for Augustus', Omnibus 37 (1999) 21-2.</page><page sequence="21">GOING TO THE DOGS / GRATTIUS &lt;&amp;&gt; THE AUGUSTAN SUBJECT 2 1 The Hunt does not even stop at sketching this blueprint for the princip√°te. After this enthusiastic paean to dictatorship, figured at one remove through the servants, the reader is directly conscripted, in propria persona , to become Rome's latest, keenest recruit (vv. 337, 344): ergo in opus uigila ?factusque? ades omnibus armis ... haec tua militia est. So work at your work and never nod. You have your rifle: use it. ... Your country needs you. This fantasy commando struts armed to the teeth he fakes to bare. From nicely wet nose to well turned-out tail, this huzzar is every inch the officer and gentleman. Hunting livery is just perfect for the show - 'a frightfully macho uniform, shiny paws and coat in perfect condition. Topped off by one of those dirks from Toledo, a screamer of a throwing-spear, plus a brute of a machete to mow down anything that gets in his way' (vv. 338^13). Let sleeping dogs lie, but here the game is out in the open. Imperatorial domination poses as care for the troops, sure as care for his dogs veils the huntsman's histrionic power-play. (The royal lesson of the Great Hunt learned by impressionable Scipio after Pydna, Polyb. 3 1 .29. 1-12.) But what the careworn dog-leader curates with all the laborious persistence he can raise is not the pack's legion lesions (vv. 344ff.), but the psychic structure of his own subjectivity. At the same time, Grattius himself trades on the lavish care he devotes to his vocation, the pains he takes on behalf of his beloved dogs, and the hoops he has jumped through for our delectation. In general this is his bid for (imperatorial?) ascendancy over any readers he might scrape together. But specifically, power/knowledge in the register of m√©dicalisation54 makes a Caesar of this vet. Again, just to make us sit up and beg, Grattius shadows the Emperor's role as High Priest of Rome. Modelling for the pious devotee who humbly ministers the cult of his chosen deity, Diana (and friends), Grattius vindicates religio from Lucretian scorn - and from the uncharacteristic depths of Virgilian despair. Dogs have a heaven, there's one thing he knows, and they have their own guardian godhead to heal them (vv. 349-51). Kindly to Grattius' artes , Apollo himself watches over and aids keepers as they dunk dogs to deal with mange (v. 426). Grottius personally testifies that seriously diseased dogs are tarred and cauterised by Vulcan in the god's Sicilian grotto, where Fire fights the sacer ignis of the raging 'tempest' of contagious disease {Georg. 3.5√ì6).55 The poet slides into the part as he ventriloquises the priest at Vulcan's chthonic epiphany, and they sort the sheep from the goats in a hieratic display of sacral power worthy of a Horatian Roman Ode (vv. 446-64, e.g. 451-6 ~ Carm. 3.2). 54 Cf. J. Henderson, 'Persius' didactic satire: the pupil as teacher', Ramus 20 (1991) 123^-8, at 129. 55 Cf. Ross (n. 15) passim , and esp. 177-83.</page><page sequence="22">22 JOHN HENDERSON As a climax, the losing battle to control the myriad afflictions of his pack culminates in Grattius 'abandoning Reason altogether' in his version of the crisis of Plague. But watch his reaction! He slips on his trusty dog-collar again and barks out a sermon on cult propriety: mitte age (non opibus tanta est fiducia nostris) 480 mitte, anime: ex alto ducendum numen Olympo, supplicibusque sacris tutela uocanda deorum ... Put it right out of your mind. Now! - We can only give you just so much cover. - Just drop it. Divine help needs fetching down from Heaven above. Holy prayers need to call on the gods for help ... This time the idcirco ... ('Wherefore ...', v. 483, cf. 328) will introduce the detailed orchestration of lustration ritual in Diana's grove to honour her holy day that has already, you may or may not recall, been mentioned (vv. 483-96). Here there is the treat, for our last glimpse of hounds, of whelps dolled up in garlands, while those lucky dogs, the hunters, sling their precious arma down in the flowers for the day of peace (vv. 485, 486f.).56 By arrogating control over his pack of reader-followers for this wee excerpt from the Fasti , Grattius rustles up salvation by baling out of chaos. His powerplay saves the cultural order with proper apportionment of roles between god, man and beast: wild animals are excluded from the scene; the domesticated herd of animals supplies the sacrificial animal; the hyper-cultural pack of puppies plays mock-human, joining the fawning young men of the hunting lodge; the human animals commune with divinity through prayer; the supra-human priest speaks for the numen. What, finally, does the fraternity pray for? 'Either to conquer the woods or to escape plague threatening from Deathstiny' ( seu uincere siluas | seu ... fatorum labes exire minasque , v v. 494f.). Doggone it, 'which priority do you care for? ( tibi ... cura prior , vv. 495f.) 18. Hownderson: 'The subject of human relations with other animals is essentially a painful one. It is not something that the learned have overlooked merely by chance. It is a topic that has been systematically evaded by our whole culture, because it makes fearful trouble.'57 There, but for Grattius' dog, go I. What about Laika the space dog ? They sent her up in a sputnik ... She starved to death.5* KING'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE JOHN HENDERSON 56 Green (n. 7) 240-5 fully explores the easy assumption that Grattius' Huntress Diana is to be located at Aricia. 57 M.
