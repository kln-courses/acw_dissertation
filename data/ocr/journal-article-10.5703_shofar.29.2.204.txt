In the sixth and final chapter, Schwartz pulls  together the different strands of his analysis, concluding that the Jews’ unusual  set of social values was a major hindrance in the process of their integration  into the Hellenistic world, and especially into the Roman empire. Newcomers to the field of ancient Judaism would probably find much  of this book too specific and too daunting, and are likely to be put off by  Schwartz’s tendency to disparage the work of earlier scholars even when he  grudgingly agrees with their conclusions. More experienced scholars will wel- come the shift from the religious-cultural focus of older scholarship—which  tended to focus on the encounter between “Judaism” and “Hellenism” or be- tween monotheism and polytheism—to the sociological, anthropological,  and post-colonial perspective taken here. They would also welcome the use of  well-known texts to illuminate issues of broad relevance not just for “Jewish”  history, but for ancient history as a whole. They too, however, might wonder  whether Schwartz was right to choose a model with which he mostly dis- agrees as the axe with which to carve into some of his favorite sources. I myself  often wondered, while reading the book, whether Schwartz’s analysis of the  ancient Jewish sources would not have benefited from a comparative glance at  the extensive data gathered by Goitein and his successors for a later period of  the Jews’ Mediterranean history. Such a comparison would easily have high- lighted a point rightly stressed by Schwartz, namely, how little we actually  know about ancient Jewish history as it was experienced in the everyday lives  of ordinary Jews. I have no doubt, however, that the late Keith Hopkins—to  whose memory this book is dedicated—would have enjoyed the combination  of originality, erudition, theoretical sophistication, and refusal to accept ac- cepted wisdoms that are evident on almost every page of this book.

Writing on Maimonides is difficult for several reasons: first there is the depth  and breadth of his thought, second the vast literature that already exists, third  the esoteric nature of his philosophic writing, and fourth the need to say some- thing new. In the past five years, three leading scholars have come out with  intellectual biographies that merit attention: Herbert Davidson, Moses Mai- monides: The Man and His Work (2005), Joel L. Kraemer, Maimonides: The  Life and World of One of Civilization’s Greatest Minds (2008), and Stroumsa’s  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="2">  General Book Reviews ♦ 205 Maimonides in His World. It is a pity that Kraemer and Stroumsa did not have  access to each other’s books prior to publication. Stroumsa is an intellectual historian whose mastery of her material is  impressive on many levels. She discusses all aspects of Maimonides’ thought  including legal, philosophic, and scientific. What is new in her approach is the  idea that we need to do a better job of presenting Maimonides as a product of  the culture that produced him: a Judeo-Arabic culture that had reached a high  degree of philosophic and scientific sophistication. Jewish audiences are often  surprised to hear that Maimonides does not mention other Jewish thinkers in  the Guide of the Perplexed and thought of himself as a disciple of Alfarabi. The  problem is that many of those who focus on his Talmudic writings overlook  the Islamic influences on his thought, while many of those who work on medi- eval Islam give short schrift to Maimonides on the grounds that he was a Jew.  One has to hope that Stroumsa’s book will change this. How much de- pends on what one thinks about Maimonides’ relation to the Almohads. Ac- cording to the standard view, the Almohads were a fundamentalist sect of Is- lam whose intolerance to anything that did not follow a strict interpretation  of the Koran was legendary both for its dogmatism and asceticism. It was the  Almohad invasion of Andalusia that forced Maimonides’ family to flee. Ac- cording to some accounts, the Almohads destroyed synagogues and may have  massacred Jews. Against this background, Stroumsa argues that Maimonides  spent nearly twenty years of his life (1148–1165) under Almohad rule, wrote  what is in effect a Jewish creed, was deeply immersed in Islamic law, produced  a systematic study of Jewish law, was often as “puritanical” in his views about  music and women as the Almohads, insisted that a strict denial of anything  that smacked of anthropomorphism be taught to all Jews, and followed many  Islamic thinkers in Almohad lands in preferring Aristotelian astronomy to  Ptolemaic.  All this is true. But does it follow that (p. 83) “Maimonides closely fol- lowed the Almohad paradigm” so that his ability to cast the Almohad revolu- tion in Jewish terms allowed him to incorporate this paradigm seamlessly into  his work? According to the dates Stroumsa gives, Maimonides lived under  Almohad rule from the ages 10 to 27. The Mishneh Torah was written when  he was in his thirties and not completed until he was 39. Having spent 17  years under Almohad rule in a formative period of his life, it is hard to imagine  that he did not absorb significant parts of its culture. But it is equally hard to  imagine that he was unaware of its harsh treatment of Jews.  Aside from historical data, there is the fact that all great thinkers not only  borrow from their surroundings but at some point go beyond them. That is a  large part of what makes them great. This is certainly true of the Guide, which   Vol. 29, No. 2   ♦   2011 </page> <page sequence="3"> 206 ♦ General Book Reviews     was completed in 1190, when Maimonides was 52. No one doubts that there  are many Islamic influences at work. In addition to the thought of Alfarabi,  one does not have to read very far to see that Maimonides is thinking about  the problems raised by Averroes’ “Decisive Treatise.” If my reading of his ac- count of creation is accurate, then despite a firm rejection of the mutakallimun  in Book One, he is indebted to Alghazali in Book Two. Still, the Guide breaks  new ground in a host of areas including metaphysics, Bible commentary, phi- losophy of religion, and, last but not least, Judaism’s understanding of itself.  This is not the place to resolve the issue of Maimonides’ relation to the Almo- hads, only to point out that Stroumsa has raised it in a perspicuous way.  Overall, Maimonides in His World is not a book for amateurs. It is, how- ever, a book that will be considered required reading for anyone who works  on Maimonides’ life and thought. Stroumsa’s scholarship is much too good  for anyone in the field to ignore. The lesson one learns from reading books  on Maimonides is that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work for a thinker  this profound—whether that approach is philosophic, rabbinic, historical, or  philological. All are needed if we are to make an honest effort to come to grips  with the full scope of Maimonides’ thought. Stroumsa has made an important  contribution in helping this effort to succeed.

Berlin: Vandenhoeck &amp; Rupecht, 2008.  360 pp.  $35.15. Thoroughly documented and written in clear prose, Veronika Lipphardt’s Bi- ology of the Jews: Jewish Scientists on “Race” and Inheritance, 1900–1935 offers  a comprehensive, detailed, and nuanced history of writers of Jewish descent  who wrote on race in the German language from the turn of the 1890s into  the early Nazi period. The book comprises an introduction, four main sections, and a conclu- sion. The introduction sets out the main questions of the book, its theoretical  approach, and a short overview of existing research on the topic. The first,  relatively short, section provides the wider context of the biologization of Jews  within the massive biologization of society, culture, and history in the latter  third of the nineteenth century, mapping out the disciplinary terrain of bio- logical sciences around 1900, and addressing the question of the role of anti- semitism in the academy at the time. The second section deals with the con- Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> </plain_text>
