<plain_text><page sequence="1">CICERO'S EDITING OF MYTHOGRAPHIC MATERIAL IN THE DE NATURA DEORUM* When Cicero uses material that survives independently elsewhere' or translates Plato,2 there is a valuable chance to watch a great stylist at work. In all three books of the De Natura Deorum, when Cicero's Epicurean, Stoic, and Academic spokesmen discuss myth, the accounts are paralleled by independent Greek versions. By comparing the Latin and Greek accounts, we can trace Cicero's ways of shaping his material.3 The material itself is especially interesting because it stems from the controversies between Stoics and their critics about the value of myth. Although every thoughtful reader of the De Natura Deorum guesses at Cicero's methods of adapting material, only one of his habits-providing Roman illustrations--has been demonstrated.4 By our comparisons we will be able to see Cicero not only inserting Roman examples while he follows the general order of his models, but also providing his own introduction and conclusions to frame borrowed material, and associating items by repeating important words and ideas. *Thanks are due to Albert Henrichs and Zeph Stewart for helpful criticisms. 1Study of the parallels has concentrated almost exclusively on the question of the nature of Cicero's sources. Much of the scholarship has been listed in M. Tulli Ciceronis De Natura Deorum, ed. A.S. Pease, 1-11 (Cambridge, MA 1955, 1958) either in the general introduction, 1.36- 51, or in the notes to particular passages. (This commentary will be cited as Pease.) In view of Pease's lengthy lists and the critical bibliography in Kleywegt's work noted below, I will indicate only those studies I found most useful, along with references to the editions of the texts used. The work of the source critics was summarized by R. Philippson, "M. Tullius Cicero, Philosophische Schriften," RE, 2e Reihe 13 (1939); 1104-1192; "Die Quelle der epikureischen Gotterlehre in Ciceros erstem Buche De Natura Deorum, " Symbolae Osloenses 19 (1939) 15-40; "Cicero, De Natura Deorum Buch II und III, eine Quellenuntersuchung," SO 21 (1941) 11-38; SO 22 (1942) 8-39; SO 23 (1944) 4-31; and SO 24 (1945) 16-47. L. Krumme perceptively indicated that Cicero's organization can be clarified in terms of these surviving texts which parallel Cicero's exposition (Die Kritik der stoischen Theologie in Ciceros Schrift De Natura Deorum [Gottingen 1941]). A less certain achievement resulted from A.J. Kleywegt's analysis of the De Natura Deorum in terms of "thought-atoms" which the author defined on the basis of discontinuities perceived in Cicero's work (Ciceros Arbeitsweise im zweiten und dritten Buch der Schrift De Natura Deorum [Groningen 1961]). Study along the lines of this present article has been called for recently by O. Gigon, "Cicero und die griechische Philosophie," Aufstieg und Niedergang der riimischen Welt, ed. H. Temporini, vol. 1.4 (Berlin 1974) pp. 241- 243. 2See R. Poncelet's Ciceron, Traducteur de Platon: 1'expression de la pens&amp;e complexe en latin classique (Paris 1957), which concentrates on technical questions of language. 3Cicero's references to his procedures include De Finibus 1.6: Quid? si nos non interpretum fungimur munere, sed tuemur ea, quae dicta sunt ab iis, quos probamus, eisque nostrum iudicium et nostrum scribendi ordinem adiungimus, quid habent, cur Graeca anteponant iis, quae et splendide dicta sint neque sint conversa de Graecis; and Ep. adAtticam XII.52.3: dir6Typac sunt, minore labore fiunt; verba tantum adfero, quibus abundo. 4See Pease 1.49-50. 143</page><page sequence="2">144 CYNTHIA L. THOMPSON Although none of the surviving Greek parallels is clearly older than Cicero, they all must be derived from the same various written sources he used. The Greek authors certainly did not copy Cicero, since they employ Greek philosophical terms correctly (not likely in re-translating from Latin) and show no signs of Ciceronian style. Here we will focus on the final use of the material, not its origin in the debate over myth between the allegorizing Stoic Chrysippus and his critics among Epicureans and in the Academy.5 Similar to the Epicurean criticism of Chrysippus' views in De Natura Deorum 1.39-41, is part of the papyrus generally identified as the Peri Eusebeias of Philodemus (c. 110-40/35 B.C.). A parallel to the presentation by the Stoic spokesman in De Natura Deorum 11.60-63 can be found in a passage attributed to Aetius (first or second century A.D.). Finally, Cicero's Academic spokesman responds in 111.40-64 to the preceding Stoic account. Parallels here come from the works of Sextus Empiricus (c. 200 A.D.) and Clement of Alexandria (c. 150-211/216 A.D.). When these sets of parallel material are compared, Cicero's editorial habits can be observed repeatedly within his dramatic context of a debate. I It is striking how closely the Epicurean account of Chrysippus' theology in De Natura Deorum 1.39-41 resembles that of its Greek parallel, the Peri Eusebeias of Philodemus.6 The outstanding type of similarity is the sequence of technical terms which represent, according to both authors, the contents of the first book of Chrysippus' Peri Thegn. At the core of Cicero's passage is a series of Latin philosophical terms, which resemble their Greek counterparts in both meaning and order. Cicero introduces the series as aspects of vis divina. column in P Herc 1428 1 ratio xAyo' iv.18 2 universae naturae animus atque mens oif) 6Xov q vX iv. 19-20 3 mundus . . . et eius animi fusio universa K6co-/Lo E4'vX4o iv.26-27 4 principatus ~yqtovtK6v iv.28-29 5 in mente et ratione qrVX71 iv.29-30 6 communis rerum natura universa atque omnia -7 KOLVW continens Tr&amp;vrcTw &amp; ojvOpv iv.32-v. 1 7 fatalis umbra Eiappe"r) v.1-2 necessitas rerum futurarum cdvyK? v.2 5Chrysippus is mentioned in all three accounts of mythography: 1.39, 1.63, and 111.63. 6The most authoritative treatment of the relationship between the two texts is found in H. Diels' Doxographi Graeci (Berlin 1879) pp. 121-129. Diels was primarily concerned whether Cicero copied Philodemus or a common source, which he identified as Phaedrus. Still standard as a text is Philodem Ober Frbmmigkeit, ed. H. Gomperz (Leipzig 1866). The readings of the passage on the Stoics have recently been checked by A. Henrichs, "Die Kritik der stoischen Theologie im P.

In the first seven items the equivalents correspond closely in Latin and Greek, although as will be noted shortly, Cicero varies stylistically the terms for mental aspects of deity. The next items, 8 through 12, are alike in content, although items 9 and 10 occur in reversed order in Philodemus' text. The last three items, which are associated with Jove by Cicero, consist of items repeated from earlier: the natural elements (item 10) and fate (item 7), with the addition of law (lex), which is paralleled toward the end of Philodemus' list. It is significant and characteristic that Cicero has made a change at the beginning of the traditional material (here the addition of the rubric vis divina) and at the end in order to set the material firmly in context. When the similarities are recognized, repeated types of difference from parallels become meaningful. The differences from Philodemus in this passage illustrate both Cicero's tendency to repeat elements and his insertion of Latin materials into a pattern derived from Greek tradition. Occasionally Cicero's account is fuller than the parallel one of Philodemus. A number of such instances are noted by Hermann Diels, who says they could be ascribed to Cicero's stylistic fullness.' One important reason for Cicero's fullness is that he repeats particular words. For example, Cicero has a liking for forms of universus and related words (2,3,6,11), natura (2,6) and res (7,11). By re- using some of these terms Cicero avoids consistently translating a particular Greek term by a particular Latin one. There is some deliberate variation in the choice of Latin equivalents. This procedure can be observed in the Latin translation of Greek words for mental aspects of deity (logos and psyche). Ratio in item 1 translates logos, while in 5 ratio, along with the paired mens, corresponds to psyche. In 2 psyche is paralleled by the paired animus and mens, and in 3 (empsychos) by animus alone. Clearly rhetorical variatio is at work here in the choice of Latin technical terms, especially in Cicero's frequent stylistic use of paired terms. Some of Cicero's length which is not paralleled by Philodemus is due to the repetition of items at the end of the list, as has already been noted. Finally, some unparalleled material is reused from Cicero's recently completed Tusculan Disputations. When law is 7Doxographi, p. 126.</page><page sequence="4">146 CYNTHIA L. THOMPSON identified in the present passage as dux vitae and magistra officiorum, these phrases echo the qualification of philosophy in the earlier work as dux vitae (5.5) and in officio magister (2.12). Since the sequence of technical terms has established adequately that in the central part of the passage Cicero follows traditional material quite closely, it will be useful now to examine the context in which he places the borrowed material. The following comparison will show how Cicero places a more general framework around the traditional material and introduces a basically chiastic type of arrangement, with sarcasm and criticism both at the beginning and at the end of the passage. Unparalleled by Philodemus Cicero's account starts with a humorous identification of Chrysippus as Stoicorum somniorum vaferrumus interpres and continues with a commonplace criticism, that his gods are incomprehensible. Next occurs the list, after which Cicero places criticism in the form of a flat denial that the items participate in vis divina. This denial, which has no parallel in Philodemus' account, balances Cicero's introduction to the list by the repetition of vis divina. Like Philodemus, Cicero distinguishes the contents of the first book of Chrysippus' Peri Thebn from the contents of the second book. Both writers maintain that the philosopher accommodated these ideas to the works of ancient Greek poets. Finally, in unparalleled fashion, Cicero's section closes with the sarcastic observation that innocent poets are made to seem Stoic. In contrast, the technical terms quoted above comprise the bulk of Philodemus' account in the immediately parallel section of Peri Eusebeias. The most important features in it which are missing from Cicero's version are two blocks of material that criticize the anthropomorphism of Greek gods (in v.8-14 and v.28-vi.1). II As with the Epicurean critique of Chrysippus, the Stoic presentation of the gods of popular religion (11.60-72) uses traditional material. The first main part (A) (11.60-63) parallels a list of types of Stoic answers to the question "where did people derive the notion of gods" contained in Aitius' doxography (I.6).8 The second part (B) (11.64-69) includes allegorical interpretation of stories from Hesiod's Theogony (64) and etymological interpretation of the names of many important Roman gods, much of which is specifically Roman.9 The third part (C) (11.70-72), a denunciation of superstition, forms the peroration of the entire section of the speech which treats the nature of the gods (quales sunt) (II.45-72). Stress here will fall on the first part, where the close parallels of content and structure make clear Cicero's methods of adapting material. Comparison between Cicero and Aitius suggests that in the De Natura "The list is attributed to Aetius' work by Diels (Doxographi, p. 58), who remarked that the treatment differs from the usual form of "opinions" by not comparing the views of several schools. The list is included among fragments of Chrysippus by H. Von Arnim in Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta (Leipzig 1903-1924) 11.10009. 9Philippson observed in SO 21 (1941) p. 38, that Cicero drew Roman examples and etymologies from a Roman work, possibly of Varro or Nigidius Figulus.</page><page sequence="5">CICERO'S EDITING OF MYTHOGRAPHIC MATERIAL 147 Deorum borrowed material is altered slightly at the beginning and end in order to fix it relevantly in context. The close resemblance of the items themselves and their order demonstrates a literary relationship between Aietius' list and Cicero's. The parallel terms for categories, which illustrate the tie, are underlined in the following schematic comparison: 1 Xa'l rpcTov tpv 7T x r76v ppatrvop~evov xaot /LETEopPOV, teo5 y&amp;p EvvotaV oOv o ror 7oiv ?paotlvol.Ew aovEripow p;uTE9 TO7VTOV /LEyaX"&amp;kq o-vtpOiwiag 6uVra aiTiov,, Xa0' TeTayTC.iVE ti.LEpaV Te xaL YVVXTa XEtl.V&amp;a TE xaL t.po0 dvaroXhai 7TE xaot 8voTax xa'Ot 7T&amp; irTo7 77T Y; ?(QoyovovlEva xa't xap7iroyovoo1Eva. 68to "7raTr )p tp Ev E80o fE ar3oe t oi3pcao6 VI7TadPXEw, i'rjTrp 8E" y" 707'rOw 8E 6 piv "7TaraTp 8t bT 7r 7&amp; w 87V ` w Ex 'eV XX"EL; -7TEp/agTw EXELV Ta r6w, 7 )8E [y'] 4r7qp 8 706 4XE(TkL raT80a xai TXTEJV fX.i7Trovre E "roi)" dr.-paT d' iEtt.ovraoT aiTrTov' TE rE70 eEpPfE jL&amp; 9pW Xthou xa'it O-EXhI'jrV Eoi)"; 7rpoqyO6pevo-a.

The present survey deals with the categories in both texts and accordingly Cicero's passage is given in abbreviated form. (Discussion of his Latin exam- ples follows shortly.) In content, although not in literary form, items and examples on Aitius' list resemble material attributed to Chrysippus' Peri Theon by Philodemus in Peri Eusebeias."' Since Chrysippan material was clearly reshaped into the seven-fold list before Cicero, however, the most meaningful comparison is between Cicero's and Aitius' versions. Aitius' first category, the traditional proof of god from the regularity of the heavens, includes the phenomena of sublunar nature as well as the courses of the heavenly bodies. Whereas in the passages quoted Aitius concisely provides examples of types of celestial and sublunar regularity, Cicero in 11.60 lengthily ties the parallel material to his long preceding discussion of celestial phenomena (11.45-58). (A short attack on Epicurean anthropomorphism [59] separates earlier discussion of heavenly matters from the quoted passage in 11.60). Accordingly, Cicero here again has altered the beginning of his traditional material in placing it within his larger context. In the center of the passage Cicero's account corresponds more closely to the parallels in Aetius, although his thematic emphasis on the beneficial effects of deity has caused one omission. Of Aitius' second and third categories, beneficial and harmful forces, Cicero's Stoic account includes only beneficial forces, although mention of harmful forces occurs in the corresponding Academic refutation (111.63). Aitius' fourth and fifth categories, passions (pathj) and "things" (pragmata) are grouped together by Cicero when he identifies res ipsa in qua vis inest maior aliqua as divine, using some of his favored vague terms (res, vis) that have been noted already in Book I. Cicero carries forward into this group the notion of beneficence derived from the previous one. The "things" he cites as examples are all positive moral forces. Cicero labels the examples of passions, which are found also in Aitius' version, as vitiosae res, and uses them as a convenient means to attack the Epicurean doctrine of pleasure, an element of dramatic dialogue. To continue the theme of benefactions Cicero reverses the order of Aitius' sixth and seventh categories. In this way human benefactors who have been deified are 1oThe category of celestial phenomena (Aitius' first)-Philodemus, Peri Eusebeias on Chrysippus = PHerc 1428 col. vi.9-13; the example of harmful forces (Aetius' second), Ares - v. 16; Zeus as a helpful force (Aitius' third) iv. 16-v.2; Eunomia and Dike as examples of "things" (Aitius' fourth) - v.4; the category of pathe (Aitius' fifth) - v.35-36; Hesiod as a poetic contriver of gods (Aitius' sixth) - vi. 20-21; category of deification of benefactors (Aitius' seventh) - vi.14-16.</page><page sequence="7">CICERO'S EDITING OF MYTHOGRAPHIC MATERIAL 149 associated by Cicero with the beneficial things which have just been enumerated. In this category many examples, such as Hercules, the Dioscuroi, and Dionysus-Liber are supplied by both Cicero and Aeitius. Aietius' sixth group, the gods invented by the poets, is listed last by Cicero. Cicero uses "poets' gods" (which allegorically convey truths of physics) as a transition to his next section (B) (11.64-69). This surveys some famous myths from Hesiod and interprets etymologically the names of many important Roman deities. Here at the end of the list too Cicero has altered material in order to fit the context. The reader may have observed in this passage Cicero's tendency to repeat important words, particularly those associated with benefits: bonitas, beneficia, utilitas. These are used not only in the passages quoted above, corresponding to specific items, but also within transitions; for example, an introduction to the categories associated with benefits (11.60): Multae autem aliae naturae deorum ex magnis beneficiis eorum non sine causa et a Graeciae sapientissimis et a maioribus nostris constitutae nominataeque sunt. and in the transition between beneficial things and human benefactors (11.62): Utilitatum igitur magnitudine constituti sunt ei di qui utilitates quasque gignebant, atque his quidem nominibus quae paulo ante dicta sunt quae vis sit in quoque declaratur deo. Such ways of emphasizing continuities alter a Greek model, as does Cicero's habit of inserting Roman examples. Cicero in effect justifies the practice by insisting that Roman maiores nostri are in agreement with the Graeciae sapientissimi. Following Cicero's statement and elaboration of the theme of beneficia, he supplies commonplace examples in Romanized form: Ceres as fruges and Liber as vinum, supported by a quotation from Terence. To illustrate the category of res ipsa in qua vis inest maior aliqua (11.61) Cicero offers a series of examples (which correspond roughly to Aitius' pragmata) that were known to have been honored by cults in Rome: ut Fides, ut Mens, quas in Capitolio dedicatas videmus proxume a M. Aemilio Scauro, ante autem ab [A.] Atilio Calatino erat Fides conse- crata. Vides Virtutis templum vides Honoris a M. Marcello renovatum, quod multis ante annis erat bello Ligustico a Q. Maxumo dedicatum. Quid Opis, quid Salutis, quid Concordiae, Libertatis, Victoriae ... Next the examples of pathi are Roman equivalents of Aeitius' (Eros-Cupid, Pothos-Voluptas, Aphrodite-Venus) with the addition of the Roman title Lubentina. Finally, Cicero's examples of deified benefactors are also Roman- ized: Hercules, Castor and Pollux, and Dionysus-Liber. Cicero adds two other examples, Aesculapius and Romulus-Quirinus. Romulus may be borrowed from a similar list of deified people in the Tusculan Disputations (1.28), which also included Hercules, Liber, Castor and Pollux, as well as Ino-Leucothea, who is mentioned in the De Natura Deorum III.48 in refutation of this present passage. Clearly Cicero has repeatedly supplied Roman examples to illustrate the validity of Greek categories.</page><page sequence="8">150 CYNTHIA L. THOMPSON III In Book 111.40-64 the Academic spokesman responds to the Stoic presentation in 11.60-72. A number of similar editorial trends may be observed. First, once again Cicero places traditional material in the center of a passage, where he follows it rather closely. There are two types of traditional material. One, paralleled by Sextus Empiricus, consists of sorites arguments that demonstrate by examples that distinctions between what is divine and what is not are very hard to draw." Most of Cicero's material comparable to this is found in 111.43-52. There are indications that Cicero is following a common source. Both Cicero and Sextus mention that they are quoting from the tradition of Carneades. The parallels between Cicero's sorites arguments and those preserved by Sextus, with one exception, follow the same order.,2 The second type of traditional material, which is found in 111.42, 53-60, consists of lists of deities who are called by the same name, but whose histories are incompatible. Three very similar lists are included by Clement of Alexandria in his Protrepticus (11.28-29)."' The remarkable similarities here too suggest that Cicero is following a common source, although it is impossible to tell if he is copying the order of items. Information given by Cicero and Clement about Jove-Zeus14 is alike except for minor details. Cicero is slightly fuller, and the Latin account is organized by locality rather than paternity. The lists of Apollos'" have the same items in the same order, with only minor divergences. "1.182-190. The text of Sextus followed is Sexti Empirici Opera II, ed. H. Mutschmann (Leipzig 1914). 12The lists begin with similar items, then diverge: Cicero 44, Sextus 182, mention Carneades, begin with Zeus and Poseidon as brother; 46 (Latona, Hecate) - 185 (Artemis, Enodia); 47 abstractions of emotions (Honos, Fides, Mens, Concordia - 188 pathW (Cicero fuses Aitius' 4 + 5); 51-184 (sun); 52 (Ceres) - 189 (Demeter). My view is that Cicero starts with an outline received from tradition, but introduces examples of his own which cause the divergences. The view of previous scholars is that Cicero's differences from Sextus should be ascribed to a source that differed from Sextus in reporting more material from Carneades. See A. Weische, Cicero und die neue Akademie (Miinster 1961) p. 38, n.7; P. Couissin, "Les Sorites de Carn6ade contre le polytheisme," REG 51 (1941) 43-57: and C.

Aside from these three specific parallels, Cicero in 111.53-60 includes many more lists of the same type. Clement, after giving details about three gods, thinks his point has been made and simply indicates that similar lists could be compiled for Aesculapius, Hermes, and Hephaestus, all of whom Cicero treats at length. Around this core of material that is paralleled by independent works is a more general frame, which will be studied under the following heading. Second, Cicero associates items once again by repeated words and ideas. In this passage of Book III the most significant repetitions indicate to what part of the Stoic presentation in Book II the Academic refutation is meant to correspond. When these correlations are traced, it becomes apparent that the general introduction (I1.40-41) and conclusion (111.61-63) recall important categories from II A (II.60-63). In the introduction, these are heavenly bodies,17 helpful forces,'8 and deified benefactors.19 In the conclusion, first the category of res ipsa occurs, with a series of personified abstractions repeated from II.62.20 Subsequently there is criticism of the explicatio fabularum, which recalls mention of poets' gods.2' In 111.63 occurs A'etius' third category, harmful forces, which is missing from Cicero's presentation in 11.60-63. It is clear, then, that substantial parts of the frame have been composed by Cicero to correspond to the categories in II A, and that the treatment aims to be comprehensive. Repetitions also mark correspondences with other major parts of the Stoic presentation. The Academic criticism of explicatiofabularum and enodatio nominum (111.62) is related to II B: the Hesiodicfabulae in 11.63-64, and the elaborate etymologies in 11.66-69. The repetition of words related to nomen is striking througout II B.22 The examples offered in 111.62 repeat those from Hesiod (Caelus and Saturn) and the etymologies of Mars (11.67), Minerva (11.67), Venus (11.69), Ceres (1I.67) and Neptune (11.66). Here Cicero has provided a part corresponding to II B, and he proceeds with echoes of II C, 16II.28.2 eEl 8~ o wIzrF e 'AO'- v&amp;q IoTiLovtraL, rv p7 v 'H T aiarov, rVi'v 'AM9,vaiav. iqjv 6~ NeiXov. rilv AiTvriT'av.

Third, within material derived from Greek sources Cicero has again inserted Roman illustrations. Some of this material is clearly related to the presentation in Book II. Cicero includes within the sorites section (111.43-52) examples of deified men from 11.6223 and res ipsae from 11.61.24 Once again Cicero recalls his Tusculan Disputations, where he anticipates not only the use of Ino- Leucothea, but also the honors given to Codrus and Erechtheus, mentioned in De Natura Deorum III.48-50.25 In addition Cicero seems to draw material from his own practical experience. A clear instance is his mention of Amphiaraus (111.49) and the decision by Roman tax-farmers about land belonging to deities who had once been human. In 73 B.C. Cicero had served on an advisory council which reviewed the claims to exemption of the Amphiaraum at Oropos.26 In sum, Cicero's ways of treating traditional material help him to produce philosophical works which are clear and eloquent. At times, however, these habits-particularly his additions and his moral bias against deification of harmful forces-reduce the accuracy of his testimony to earlier thought. Nevertheless, the presentations which frame detailed traditional material with more general introductions and conclusions can be easily understood and remembered. The slight alterations at both ends give the material relevance and balance. Second, Cicero's frequent repetition of important words and ideas contributes to literary effectiveness. In Book I the repetition of terms gives a kind of coherence to a disparate list. In Book II the repeated theme of beneficence simplifies the model by associating a number of items. In Book III elements repeated from Book II identify corresponding parts and are an important factor in creating the impression of a debate. Third, Cicero's insertion of Roman examples from his own experience or elsewhere gives immediacy and vitality to a treatise intended to popularize philosophy among a Roman audience. CYNTHIA L.
