<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bir-kot-ghundai (Swat, Pakistan) 1978 Excavation Report by Giorgio Stacul In Autumn 1978 the Italian Archaeological Mission resumed excavation work at Bir-kot-ghundai in the Sw?t Valley, as part of the programme of the Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici of IsMEO and with the collaboration of the University of Trieste. Excavation was carried out in two areas (B and C) very close to the pre? viously excavated one (Area A): Area B measures c. 42 sq.m. and Area C 14 sq.m. (fig. 1). The occupation layers and the cultural sequence showed some general features closely resembling those of the previous site (Stacul 1978). Area B The first occupation in the area rested on a very compact and clayey deposit which corresponds to the natural soil (layer ?) (fig. 2). On the floor level there were a large number of potsherds, mostly in a worn condition, and two terracotta human figurines (fig. 7.1, 2). On the eastern side of the area, layer ? was cut in such a way as to frame a flight of steps cut in the slope (figs. 9, 10). At the bottom, on a step cut in the slope, two pits were dug in the clayey soil. Pit 1. A shallow, circular pit with sloping sides and a flat bottom. Max. diam. 1.25 m., depth 0.35 m. The filling consisted of grey clay mixed with small, worn potsherds. At the bottom the fill was of discoloured clay subsoil. Pit 2. A beehive-shaped pit, almost circular in plan. Main axis 1.40 m. at the top and 1.65 m. at the bottom, depth 0.53 m. The fill was comprised of two deposits, the upper one of clayey soil (layer (D) and the lower one of (*) The excavation was directed by the author. Mr Aftab Ahmed Khan joined the Mis? sion on behalf of the Department of Archaeology and Museums of the Pakistan Govern? ment.

Both drawings and photographs are filed in the archives of the Museo Nazionale d'Arte Orientale in Rome. 55</page><page sequence="2">ash mixed with potsherds. The typological features of the potsherds we re? covered enabled us to connect the pit with the earliest occupation of the area. Layer ? showed the remains of two walls made of irregularly shaped stones and river pebbles, which had been built into layer ?. Wall c (in the NW corner of the area) is 0.45-0.50 m. wide and represents the northward exten? sion of wall c in Area A (Stacul 1978: fig. 11). The eastern end of wall b rested on the slope of layer @ (figs. 9, 10). On a reddish clay floor-level, at the base of layer ?, was a flat quern-stone and a large quantity of potsherds. As in Area A, a thick, fairly loose deposit of light-brown clay divides this occupation phase from the following one, shown by layer ?. Layer ? consisted of dark-grey, very stony earth with ashes and charcoal remains. It was marked by a hard-packed clay floor, on which lay some almost complete pots (fig. 5.2-4) and two terracotta figurines (fig. 7.3,4). No walls appeared in the cutting. Layer ? was marked by a hard clayey floor on which were found potsherds and faunal remains. Layer ? consisted of light-brown earth with only a few potsherds. Layer ? showed remains of a solid walling 0.50-0.55 m. wide, built into layer ? (fig. 8). Along the northern side there were four large slabs fixed into the soil, 1.40-1.60 m. from each other. The floor was a hard clayey soil mixed with pebbles and small slabs. Area C As in Area A (Stacul 1978: fig. 2), the excavated layers were likewise featureless. Layer ? showed the earliest occupation phase. A large area of burnt clay, which represents a hearth, rested on layer ?. Potsherds and faunal remains were recovered here, mixed with charcoal and ashes. Layer ? produced fragmentary indications of a wall made of irregularly shaped slabs and pebbles, almost 0.50 m. wide, built into layer ? (wall a). On the reddish, hard clay floor-level, a large number of potsherds and faunal re? mains were recovered. Layer ? was a thick deposit of fairly loose clay, superimposed by layer ?, which was marked by a hard clay floor. On the floor was found a storage-jar and a large quantity of potsherds. This level and layer ? which extended below it were cut by four almost circular pits (fig. 11). Pit 1 was circular-oval in plan, with almost vertical sides and a flat bottom. Main axis 1.90 m., depth 1.10 m. The filling was black soil mixed with ashes and charcoal remains. At the bottom there were fragments of large pots. 56</page><page sequence="3">Pit 2 was circular in plan, with slightly sloping sides and an irregular, flat base. Diam. 1.15 m., depth 0.75 m. The filling was grey clay with only a few potsherds. Pit 3 was almost circular in plan, with vertical sides and a flat base. Diam. 0.95 m., depth 0.60 m. It was filled with uniform grey soil mixed with small stones. Pit 4 lay on the NW edge of the area and only half of it has been exca? vated. Main axis 1.70 m. or more, depth 1.05 m. The lower filling consisted of black soil mixed with potsherds, charcoal and faunal remains. The filling of layer ? consisted of black or grey soil mixed with a large quantity of potsherds and faunal remains. Layer ? produced only a few potsherds. Layer @ showed no structural features but its floor was covered with charcoal remains and ash. Layer 0 consisted of dark-grey earth with potsherds and faunal remains. As in Area A the floor was paved with small slabs and pebbles. Two almost complete pots rested on it (fig. 5.9,11). Finds According to the stratigraphical sequence and the typology of the finds, the pottery and the other objects have been grouped in four assemblages: (I) from layers ? and ?; (II) from layer ?; (III) from layers ?-?; (IV) from layer ?. With reference to the chronological sequence of Ghaligai (Stacul 1969), the assemblages are ascribed to Period IV (I), to an intermediate phase between Period IV and Period V (II), to Period V (III) and to Period VII (IV). (I) Period IV Pottery. The best collection of pottery came from Area C, where the sherds were fresh, unworn and fairly large. On the contrary, a large part of the pottery from Area B, layer @, consisted of small sherds with rolled edges (the same feature was observed in the same layer of Area A). As in the previous excavation the main ranges of pottery are the follow? ing: (A) grey to brown gritty ware; (B) black to grey and buff ware, generally burnished; {C) Red, usually painted ware (black-on-red). Some sherds of soapy grey painted ware (black-on-grey) were also recovered. Including the pottery from Area A, the ratio is as follows: (A) 36%, (B) 44%, (C) 19%. 57</page><page sequence="4">The gritty ware (A) is represented by globular or oval-shaped jars with rippled rim and disk-base (fig. 3.1,2). Out of a total of twenty-six fragments including the disk-base, which very probably belongs to this shape, mat- or basketjimpressions on the outer surface have been observed on three specimens only, recovered in layer ?. The burnished ware (B) include types such as the bowl on a conical pedestal (fig. 3.3), the deep bowl with sinuous profile and straight rim (fig. 3.4,5) and the large storage-jar with straight sides (fig. 3.6). The surface-colour is usually black or grey (less commonly buff), with both colours occurring sometimes on the same vase in a mottled surface. Some few sherds show on the inner sur? face traces of the fast wheel. Red ware (C) is represented by such types as the bowl with flared sides on a conical pedestal (fig. 4.1,2,7), the small globular bowl with low conical pedestal (figs. 4.3; 18), the globular (?) vase with disk-base (fig. 4.13) and the large roll-rimmed storage-jar with flared sides (fig. 4.14). The majority of this ware shows traces of having been turned on the fast wheel. A large quantity of potsherds of red ware are painted with black bands and sometimes with other motifs too. Simple horizontal bands, in groups from two to six, mostly occur on the body of the vases or on conical pedestals. Groups of slanting and wavy lines occur also on conical pedestals (figs. 4.10,11; 23). As in the previous excavation, other painted motifs included floral and fau nal representations (figs. 6; 12-17). We may distinguish the pipal tree (figs. 6.2; 17), different species of leaves (figs. 6.6-9; 15) and birds (figs. 6.3,4; 12-14). Stars (fig. 6.2,8) and a human-like figure near a disk-tipped cross (figs. 6.10; 16) are also represented. On a potsherd of grey soapy ware we have a black-painted double-axe shaped leaf (?) (fig. 6.6). Other decorations on red ware consist of cord-marked impressions, which mostly occur on fragments of bowls with flared sides (fig. 22). Terracotta figurines. Two human terracotta figurines were recovered in layer @: ? the upper part of a highly simplified, brown, female figurine with al? most flattened body, slightly pointed arms, eyes and nose suggested by simple dots and with the dotted outline of a necklace on the breast and shoulders (fig. 7.1); ? a rough, brown female figurine with irregular, roundish body, dotted eyes and prominent breast (fig. 7.2). Other clay artifacts. Other fired clay artifacts consisted of three biconical spindle-whorls, seven discoid potsherds with a central hole and fifteen plain discoid potsherds (fig. 31). 58</page><page sequence="5">Stone artifacts. The stone artifacts include: ? a fragment of a schist mould with shapes of axe (?) and of another object on one side, from layer ? (fig. 7.15); ? two fragments of mace-heads or ring-stones, trapezoid in section with central hole; ? eight irregularly shaped disks of schist with central hole, from 0.06 to 0.09 m. in diameter; ? four irregularly shaped plain disks of schist, from 0.06 to 0.10 m. in diameter; ? ten discoid scrapers made from pebbles. Bone artifacts. The bone artifacts include: ? a fine sharp polished point made from a piece of large bone, from layer ? (fig. 7.9); ? a flat axe-like amulet with central hole and with red painted signs on one side, from layer ? (fig. 7.7); ? a polished arrow-head round in section with cylindrical hole at the end, from layer ? (fig. 7.8); ? two fragments of flat polished objects with roundish end, decorated with incised lines on both sides, from layer ? (fig. 7.11,12); ? a fragment of polished pin with two flattened globules at the end and with incised crossed lines on the body, from layer ? (fig. 7.10); ? three fragments of polished pin, round in section; ? two narrow points made on metacarpal or metatarsal of sheep or goat; ? two flat points made from pieces of large long bones. Metal artifacts. Three metal artifacts were recovered in layer ?: ? a copper fish-hook (fig. 7.16); ? a fragment of flat copper wire; ? a very small fragment of thin gold plate. "Faience" beads. The "faience" beads include: ? a quadrifoliate bead with four dotted incised circles at both sides and with transverse hole, from layer ? (fig. 7.13); ? a cog-wheel shaped bead with central dotted circles at both sides and transverse hole (fig. 7.14); ? two very small discoid beads with central transverse hole. (II) Intermediate phase Pottery. As in the earliest occupation layers of the site, the pottery from layer ? comprises (A) grey to brown gritty ware, (B) black-grey and buff burnished 59</page><page sequence="6">ware and (C) red or black-on-red painted ware. The other pottery consists of (D) grey-metallic ware, medium to fine in texture, sometimes turned on the fast wheel, and (E) brown medium-textured ware. The selected shapes include: ? two buff-burnished bowls with shallow body, high carination and con? cave neck (figs. 5.1,2; 19); ? two grey-metallic carinated bowls with deep body, concave sides and disk base (figs. 5.3,4; 21); ? two grey^metallic bowls with sinuous profile and almost straight rim (figs. 5.5,6; 20). Grooved decoration occurs on grey-metallic ware (figs. 5.5; 20). Terracotta figurines. Two terracotta figurines were recovered: ? a brown human figurine with flattened body, pointed arms, dotted out? line of necklace on the breast and dotted concentric circles showing the sex (figs. 7.3; 28); ? a grey figurine with almost flattened body decorated with impressed circles, and with conical end (figs. 7.4; 26; 27). Other clay artifacts. The other fired clay artifacts include a brown discoid spindle-whorl (fig. 7) and five grey and brown discoid potsherds with central hole. Stone artifacts. The stone artifacts include two discoid scrapers made from peb? bles and three irregularly shaped disks of schist with central hole. Bone artifacts. They include a tubular object, oval in section, with incised lines on one end, and one narrow polished point made from an unidentified bone. (Ill) Period V Pottery. The main ranges of pottery from layers ?-? comprise shapes on grey and red surface with thick sides (Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972: p. 15). They include: ? a grey pot with almost globular body, straight rim and disk-base, from layer ? (fig. 5.6); ? a grey cordoned vessel with sinuous profile, flared rim and disk-base, from layer ? (fig. 5.9); ? a fragment of grey ware decorated with plain and dotted incised tri? angles (fig. 24); ? the upper part of a red jar with flared rim, from layer ? (fig. 5.8); 60</page><page sequence="7">? a grey miniature pot with sinuous profile and disk-base, from layer ? (fig. 5.7). Other clay artifacts. The other fired clay artifacts include: ? a brown biconical spindle-whorl with incised straight lines on the body, from layer ? (fig. 7.6); ? Three grey and brown biconical spindle-whorls, from layers ? and ?; ? a brown almost globular spindle-whorl, from layer ?; ? five grey and brown discoid potsherds with central hole, from layers ? and ?. Metal artifacts. The metal artifacts include three copper specimens: ? a point with quadrangular-sectioned body, from layer ? (fig. 7.17); ? an incurved wire, circular in section with pointed ends, from layer ? (% 31); ? three fragments of pins (?), circular in section, from layers ? and ?. (IV) Period VII Pottery. The pottery includes red ware with thick and thin sides and a few pieces of fine grey ware. Selected shapes from layer ?: ? a grey miniature pot with deep body, slightly concave sides, low carina tion and curved bottom (fig. 5.11); ? a red carinated bowl with large mouth and with incurved and cordoned rim (fig. 5.12). Commentary 1. The earliest occupations of the site, ascribed to Period IV in the Gh? ligai sequence (c. 1700-1400 B.C.), show two subsequent structural phases: an early one which is evidenced by pits cut in the natural soil, and a late one characterized by stone-walled rooms. It seems remarkable that a similar subsequence of structural features, dur? ing Period IV, has been observed recently at Loebanr III too, where under? ground structures were superimposed by stone-walled constructions (Stacul, in this issue of EW). Only a few typological differences have been noticed here between the pottery and the other finds of the two occupation periods. Both may be ascribed to Late Period IV, which is especially characterized by the red wheel-turned and painted ware. As in the previous excavations, the black-on-red painted ware includes spe 61</page><page sequence="8">cimens decorated with faunal and floral representations, such as birds (figs. 6.1,3,4; 12-14), pipal leaves (figs. 6.2; 17), double-axe shaped leaves (?) (fig. 6.6, 7). The other motifs include stars (fig. 6.2, 8), spirals (fig. 6.5) and a human-like stylized figure near a disk-tipped cross (figs. 6.10; 16). Some painted patterns such as the pipal leaves or tree recall somewhat the Harappan painting tradition. The representation of the pipal leaves in a group of three is mostly recorded on pottery from Cemetery R 37 at Harappa (Wheeler 1947: pi. XLVI 6) and from Mundigak IV (Casal 1961: fig. 65). The survival of the Harappan decoration pattern in this cultural complex has been already ob? served by the occurrence of the four-petalled rosette or intersecting-circle motif (Stacul 1978: figs. 7.6; 26). Other designs may be compared rather with patterns of the so-called Cul? ture of Cemetery H. We refer to the stars, the birds' heads like multi-rayed sun motifs (fig. 6.3,4) (Vats 1940: PI. LXVI, 82), the double-axe shaped leaves (fig. 6.5,6) (Vats 1940: PI. LXVI, 86). The spiral motif (fig. 6.5) shows some af? finities with a pattern common in the Bara assemblage (Pur?tattva 1971-72: fig. 10.17). This assemblage includes also a singular representation consisting of a human-like figure near a disk-tipped cross (figs. 6.10; 16). The figure is composed of a vertical line, which corresponds to the body, connected with two sharp cornered lines, corresponding to the arms. At the opposite sides, close to the arms, there are four or five vertical strokes indicating hands and fingers. The above interpretation was suggested by the occurrence of similar human? like representations on pottery connected with the Ma-ch'ang stage of the Yang shao culture in Northern China (Andersson 1943: pis. 190, 191), i.e. a stylistical horizon which was evidenced also in the Tarim basin in Sinkiang region (Berg? man 1939; Andersson 1943: 279). More evidence for the relation with Harappan peoples seems also to be provided by some types of beads recovered in layers ? and ?. We refer first to a quadrifoliate "faience" bead with four dot-centred cir? cles (fig. 7.13), which may be compared with the trefoliate and quadrifoliate beads with dot-centred circles, common in the Indus Valley during the period of the Harappa Culture (Marshall 1931: PI. CXLVI, 40; Jarrige and Le chevallier 1979: fig. 45.3). Another quadrifoliate bead, with five dot-centred circles, was recovered at this site in the previous excavation (Stacul 1978: figs. 9.2, 41). We refer also to a cog-wheel shaped "faience" bead with dotted circles at the centre (fig. 7.14), similar to a star-shaped bone bead previously found at this site (Stacul 1978: figs. 9.1, 40). Both recall some painted patterns which are very common on jars and lids from Cemetery H (Vats 1940: PI. LXIII.4, 12,14; PI. LXIV.10; PI. LXV.26-29). 62</page><page sequence="9">2. Layer ? produced evidence of a intermediate phase between periods IV and V. The pottery includes the main ranges of the recovered ware in the earliest occupation layers (gritty-brown, black-burnished and red-painted wares), as well as a new fabric (grey-metallic ware) which was especially evidenced in Period V. Peculiar shapes of this phase are three types of bowl: the carinated bowl, the bowl with sinuous profile and the shallow open bowl. The type of carinated bowl with concave sides is represented here by two specimens (figs. 5.3,4; 21), while another three specimens were recovered in the previous excavation (Stacul 1978: figs. 6.1-3; 17). The very sharp and pointed carination distinguished this shape from the carinated bowls common during the Period IV at Loebanr III (Stacul 1977: fig. 13.1-8). The same type shows also a marked difference in comparison to the grey carinated vessels common in the Early Period V, which are characterized by a deeper body and a narrower mouth (Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972: PI. XVIII a,b). The type of bowl with sinuous profile is represented by two specimens of grey-metallic ware (figs. 5.5,6; 20). A similar shape has been recovered in layer ? of the same area (fig. 3.4) as well as at Loebanr III (Stacul 1976: fig. 10 m) and at Aligr?ma (Stacul and Tusa 1977: fig. 12 h). The grooved decoration on the body (fig. 5.5) is a decorative pattern which usually appears on the pottery of Period V. The type of open bowl with shallow body and rim bent outwards, is repre? sented by two buff-burnished specimens (fig. 5.1,2). They show some affinities with shapes from the Dashly complex in Northern Afghanistan (Sarianidi 1976: fig. 31.4) and from the Tulkar graveyard in the Bishken Valley, Southern Tad zhikistan (Mandelstam 1968: PI. XIV 1-5), both ascribed to the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. In this cultural assemblage, of particular interest is a flat-shaped human figurine with the pointed outline of a necklace and pointed sex (figs. 7.3, 28). The flattened and very simplified body, as well the pointed necklace, seem to be de? rived from a model common during Period IV, which is noticed at this same site (figs. 7.1, 26). As regards the flat-shaped human figurines in Central Asia, it was ob? served that ?in contrast to Chalcolithic figurines, where there was an attempt at realistic modelling in the round, the figurines of the Bronze Age were flat and stylized, without any tridimensional modelling ? (Masson and Sarianidi 1972: 129). It was also noticed that this new iconographic tradition, as well the con? nected ideology, spread from Northern Iran (Tepe Hissar, Tureng Tepe) to Sou? thern Turkmenia (Altin-depe, Namazga-depe IV-V) and further to the east, to? gether with the spreading of the black pottery (Ghirshman 1977: 36-38). 63</page><page sequence="10">In the Sw?t Valley the earliest bidimensional human figurines have been recovered at Loebanr III (Stacul 1977: fig. 20.1-6). They were generally found around the fire-places, associated with animal figurines representing the humped bull. As in other sites and cultures (Masson and Sarianidi 1972: 134), the bi? dimensional stylization was applied here only to the anthropomorphic representa? tions, while the zoomorphic ones were shaped in the three-dimensional style. 3. As has been noticed in the previous report, the upper layers showed stone-walled structures and occupation layers ascribed to Middle-Late Period V and to Period VII. Some shapes in grey ware with deep body and disk-base, from layer (Z) (fig. 5.8-11), are characteristic of Middle Period V, as it is shown by the strati graphical evidence of Aligr?ma, where a similar assemblage of pottery has also been found on the same floor-level (Stacul 1979: figs. 47, 48). The subsequent Period VI, evidenced in the nearby areas by sherds and other finds collected on the surface, is not represented at this site. A very common shape of Period VII is the red carinated bowl recovered in layer ? (fig. 5.13), which is almost identical with a type common in the graves of the same period (Silvi Antonini and Stacul 1972: PI. VIII c). The finds here include iron objects.
