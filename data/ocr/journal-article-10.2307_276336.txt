<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY OF COTUA ISLAND, AMAZONAS TERRITORY, VENEZUELA JOSE M. CRUXENT* COTUA Island is situated among the Yavariven Rapids of the Orinoco River northwest of the island of Maria Auxiliadora in Latitude 5?35'N and Longitude 67?35'W (Fig. 4). It measures some 2000 meters long and 500 meters wide. About four years ago, when the waters of the Orinoco were unusually high, they completely covered the island. Nevertheless, a Creole is now living there, as the fertility of the soil is great enough to overcome his fear that the river will again rise over the island. Directly west of his house, the water has eroded pebbles and Indian potsherds from the ground (Fig. 4, 4). To the southeast, on Maria Auxiliadora Island, there are petroglyphs (Fig. 4, 1), and in addition both islands bear workshops, where the Indians appear to have ground stone artifacts on outcrops of rock (Fig. 4, 2, 3, 5). During a visit to Cotua Island in 1948, we collected artifacts from both the pottery de- posit and the workshops. The following is an account of the circumstances and nature of our finds. POTTERY DEPOSIT The base of Cotua Island consists of a granite outcrop, and it was on an eroded section of this rock that sherds and other artifacts were most numerous (cf. Fig. 5, upper right and lower left). All had been much broken by the stream. POTSHERDS Rims The rims can be divided into 37 types, which are illustrated in Figure 6. In the following description, the letters refer both to the types and to the drawings in Figure 6. Type a: simple, somewhat thickened rim from a medium sized vessel for holding liquids. Four examples. Type b: simple, slightly thickened rim. The curvatures suggest a shallow, open bowl of medium size. Eight exam- ples. Type c: straight, flat rim, which is moderately polished only on one side. This appears to be from a straight- rather than a curving-sided vessel. Twelve examples, one of which has a conical hole, as shown in the illustration. Type d: flat rim, slightly indented beneath the lip; from a medium-sized vessel for holding liquids. One example. * Translated by Irving Rouse. Type e: simple, thickened rim from a large vessel for hold- ing liquids. Ten examples. Type f: simple rim from a medium-sized open bowl. Six examples. Type g: simple rim from a plate, very open bowl, or possibly a lid. Its curvature indicates a diameter of approxi- mately 31 cms. Eight examples. Type h: rim of a shallow, open bowl some 30 cm. in di- ameter. Three examples. Type i: rim of a shallow (?), open bowl about 40 cm. in diameter. One example. Type j: simple, thickened rim, possibly from a plate. Two examples. Type k: simple rim, from a constricted bowl of medium size. One example. Type 1: neck and rim with part of a vertical, flat loop handle attached. One example. Type m: rim of an open bowl, decorated on the lip with modeled projections. One example. Type n: flat, expanded rim from an open bowl or platter, measuring some 18 cm. in diameter, with an incised line near the edge of the lip. One example. Type o: flat, expanded rim from an open bowl or platter. Three examples. Type p: flanged rim from an open bowl about 30 cm. in diameter. Two examples, one having incised decoration. Type q: flanged rim from an open bowl some 30 cm. in diameter. Three examples. Type r: flanged rim from an open bowl about 30 cm. in diameter. Incised decoration similar to Type p. One exam- ple. Type s: flanged rim from an open bowl. The thickness is irregular because of the presence of ornamented appendages and incision. Three examples.

Type a has two peculiarities: its hori- zontal curvature is not what one would expect in the case of a round vessel, and it is polished on the inner rather than the outer surface. We have made a hypothetical reconstruction of the FIG. 5. Cotua Island, Venezuela. U.pper left, rapids of Yavariven, seen from the island.

The type is represented by two specimens. We have only a single example of Type b, a tall annular base; eleven of Type c, a short annular base; and one of Type d, a flat base. Handles The four fragmentary handles are of two types (Fig. 7, B, a, b). Type a consists of a broad, vertical strap handle with relatively little curvature, so that it is far from being semiannular when viewed from the side. Its top was attached to the lip of the vessel. There are two examples, one 98 mm. wide and the other 97. The one illustrated has a conical lug in the center of the top of the loop; the other is plain. Type b is also a vertical strap handle but narrower and with a thicker, more ovoid cross section. Like a, this type has the form of a flattened loop. There are two examples, one measuring 68 mm. in width and the other 67. Both are too fragmentary to determine their position on the vessel. Decoration Incision. Figure 7, C illustrates the incised designs to be found on body sherds; incision on rim sherds is illustrated in Figure 6, p, r-x, b', ct, f', g', 1'. The designs may be divided into two groups, one with narrow lines (1 mm.) and the other with broad lines (2 mm.). All appear to be geometric. Painting. Some sherds have traces of a uni- form red or white slip, or are red on one sur- face and white on the other. Two white- slipped specimens have been rubbed with a hard object before or after firing so that the reddish clay shows through the white paint in the form of stripes. Modeling. The pottery has been so broken by the action of the river that only a few examples of lugs and other appendages have survived. We obtained the following, which are illustrated in Figure 7, D: a) An appendage rising above the rim of an open bowl and decorated with incision. b) A mammiform lug, which may have been a false handle. c) A lug similar to b, which has three small mammelary projections on its end. d) A curve( sherl, possibly from the l)ody of the vessel, which bears three somewhat flattened lugs, each wvith a conical punctation in its center. e) Another mammiform lug, similar to b, but smaller in size. Like the latter, it is hollow. f) A mammiform lug applied to the body of a vessel. g) An interesting fragment which, if it was part of an anthropomorphic lug, may have been the lower half of a thick-lipoed mouth such as those found at Los Barrancos on the lowxer Orinoco,' and Rlo Chico, El Palito, and San Javier along the north coast of Venezuela.2 OTHER ARTIFACTS Discs We obtained two discs or counters of clay, which we have been careful not to-confuse with potsherds that may have acquired a discoidal shape through rolling (Fig. 7, E). It is apparent that these specimens were manufactured as discs. They have a thickness of 8 mm. and a diameter of 80 and 102 mm. respectively. Polishers Two stone polishers were found. These are composed of the local granitic rock and show only traces of use. They may possibly have served in the manufacture of pottery. Stamps The site yielded two fragments of clay stamps (Fig. 7, F, a, b). Specimen a is from a cylindri- cal, ocher-colored specimen with a central perforation. It is decorated with linear and triangular motives. Specimen b is also cylindri- cal, but greyish in color. It may possibly have had an interior perforation. The design consists of concentric triangles. We also obtained one complete stamp of bone (Fig. 7, F, c). This is triangular in shape and decorated with concentric circles and triangles Whorls There are two spindle whorls of clay, circular in shape, with a conical perforation in the center of each. Their maximum diameters are 102 and 104 mm. and their thicknesses 5 and 7 mm. respectively. Beads Several stone beads were collected. These had a discoidal shape. I Cornelius Osgood and George D.

Since the material has been eroded from the ground and is not in stratigraphic position, we cannot attach any chronological significance to the presence of these sherds. WORKSHOPS NATURE OF THE SITES The workshops were situated near the house (Fig. 4, 2, 3). It was here that the Indians made stone beads and possibly other artifacts of the same material. Workshop 700. The most important of the workshops may be seen in Figure 5, lower right. It is composed of seven half-lenticular basins and a circular one. We believe that the former served for the manufacture of stone imple- ments and cylindrical beads. The latter, which is of a type not previously encountered, may have been used in the trimming, grooving, and facial polishing of discoidal beads and other flat-surfaced artifacts. The abrasive quality of the rock must have been important for the work of grinding. It is possible that fine sand and water were added to increase the efficiency of the process, al- though we have no evidence of this except for the fact that all the workshops are near water. The half-lenticular basins illustrated in Figure 5, lower right have the following lengths and widths: 1, 127X33 mm.; 2, 114X16mm.; 3, 192X15 mm.; 4, 112X11 mm.; 5, 94X24 mm.; and 6, 83X10 mm. The circular basin (7) measures 167 mm. in diameter and 12 mm. in depth. Workshop 701. This consists of two elongated basins near a depression in the rock filled with water. Both this site and Workshops 702 and 703 appear to be best adapted to the sharpening of stone adzes and axes, in that one wall of each basin is almost vertical whereas the other is sloping. The two basins measure respectively 129X28 mm. and 112X11 mm. Workshop 702. Here, there is a single elon- gated basin near a pool of water, measuring 134 mm. in length and 19 mm. in width. Workshop 703. This also consists of a single elongated basin alongside a pool of water. The length is 129 mm. and its width 23 mm. Workshop 704. The final basin is of the same type as 7 at Workshop 700, but only a part of the circle remains. We believe that it had simi- lar uses. If it was circular, its measurements were the same. OBJECTS FOUND Sandstone pebbles and chips of various sizes and colors were collected at the workshops. These may be classified so as to illustrate stages in the manufacture of discoidal beads: (1) pebbles, as found in their natural state; (2) pebbles from which chips have been struck off; (3) the chips themselves, which in their crude state are more or less leaf-shaped and rough surfaced; (4) chips with the first traces of the battering necessary to make them circu- lar; (5) chips on which the grinding of the two faces and the edge has been begun; (6) beads which have been well rounded and polished on both faces; (7) beads on which a conical per- foration has been started from one side; and (8) circular, polished beads with biconical per- forations. CONCLUSIONS The pottery deposit has considerable interest because it is the southernmost known in Vene- zuela and is situated on the route of travel between the Orinoco and Amazon rivers. While the collection is small, it permits us to suggest some ideas concerning relationships in material culture of the Indian inhabitants. In connection with the rim typology, it is important to note a similarity in profile be- tween the projecting flanges with incised de- signs and comparable specimens from Los Barrancos on the lower Orinoco,3 although the Cotua flanges are less elaborately and artisti- cally decorated. The two sites also resemble each other in the presence of vertical handles and annular bases, traits which are found, however, in different contexts at other sites. The incised and modeled decoration is too fragmentary to characterize in any detail. However, it is to be noted that Cotua pottery differs both from that which Howard4 obtained in the upper levels at Ronquin on the middle Orinoco and from the comparable material collected by Petrullo in Amazonas Territory and by the Evans in Brazilian Guiana,5 in that it is much less elaborately incised and punc- tated. Cotua pottery can also be distinguished I Osgood and Howard, op. cit., Fig. 18. 4George D.

In view of these distinctions, and because the comparable Los Barrancos pottery appears to be intermediate in age between Early and Late Roonquin,6 we suggest that Cotua occupied an intermediate chronological position. This is consistent with its location on the route of communication from Ronquin to the compara- ble Brazilian sites, between which some rela- tion at a later date now seems to be indicated.
