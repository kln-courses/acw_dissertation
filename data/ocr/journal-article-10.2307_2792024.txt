MURRAY Surv'eyor of Antiquities, Nigeria J Wooden inasks combininlg lhuman and animal features in one carving are common among the Ijo of Southern Nigeria, as Mr.' William Fagg states in his recent article (MAN, I947, II3). These carvings sometimes include other things besides, such as aeroplanes, trees and birds, in a manner suggestive of thlC designs of Surrealist art: the features of the face are always extremely formalized. The most distinctive characteristic of the Ijo style of carving is that the masks are really headdresses, to be worn like caps on the top of the dancer's head, with the human features looking up at the sky instead of in an upright, niatural position looking forward. This does not, however, apply to all Ijo hieaddresses, nor do we always find several kinds of objects and beings combined in onie carving. Some headdresses with humani faces are carried vertically; others, unmixed with fish, animlial or bird, look upwards. Others again are straightforward representations of fish or bird carved on an oval base or cap. Nevertlheless, the conception of a carving carried on top of the head witlh a lhumlani face looking up at the sky, often with horns and a prolongation of what would be the clhin into a fislh's, animllal's or bird's mouth, is Ijo and is not found, except perlhaps very excep- tionally, or by derivationi from the Ijo, in the carving of adjacent peoples (I have hiad no opportunity to make a close study of Sobo carving). The type has a distributioni in Nigeria along the creeks near the sea froml Epe near Lagos to Opobo in Calabar Province. The carvings usuallv represent water spirits, and an explanationi comillonly given for the positioIn of the face is that they were originally copied from spirits seen floating or sUInIing tlhemselves on the surface of the water. The people living along the Nigerian creeks show a markedly superstitious interest in any uinusual object that appears in the water. Carvings embodying the same conception occur also among the Ibo, but onlv in an area near Onitsha-froim Aguleri in the north to the boundary between Orlu Divi- sioIn and Onitslha Province in the south, and eastwards as far as Okigwi. In view of thiis limited distribution and the fact that no carvings of related design are found elsewlhere among the Ibo, the type is unlikely to be an Ibo inventioin, and it seemIis a reasonable assumption thiat its geIneral formi was copied from the Ijo. It is noticeable hiow often Ibo carvings show influences from the art of neighbouring peoples, which influences, if plotted on a map, would appear like fingers spreading into Iboland. The Ibo are great borrowers, and it is- commoIn now to find instances * With Plate A atnd 3 text J_iures where traders have been responisible for the introduction to their home district of a play that they saw during their travels. It is probablc, therefore, that Ibos trading along the River Niger introduced this Ijo desigin of headdress to the district round Onitsha. There are two main varieties among the Ibo of this dis- tinctive type of carving: one clearly hias a bird's (probably a hornbill's) head, and the other hias an elongated, rect- angular 'mouth' that miglht represent bird, fish or animal. - SE 7~~~~Q FIG. 5. 'OJI ONU FCROM OZUBULU They are called, according to thc clan, either ulagla or oji onilu, and sometimiies both names are used in the same clan but for different carvings: oji otiti is described as a 'singing juju' and ulaga as one that 'beats' people. They are used at festivals and funerals by miemlibers of the tmmtio society. The first variety, tulaga from north-west of Awka, is shown in figs. i and 2, from Achalla and Umluigwedo respectively. They botlh distinctly hiave a lhuman nose and forehead in a horizontal position together with the head of a bird with a curved beak and a pair of ram's horns, which are siniilar to those on some of the Ibo figure-carvings I</page><page sequence="3">No. i Man, JANUARY, I948 called ikenga. The ulaga are male spirits; this is shown by the carving from Achalla, which has cicatrizations on the forehead like the ichi marks worn by men who have taken title. The Umuigwedo carving is a more curvilinear type of composition and has two small 'nmedicinie' pots on top of the horns. Both carvings have a stand, the conical shape of which would help to secure the cloth or raffia hangings which hide the dancer's face; holes in the base are for tying the carving on the head. In both carvings the eyes have been given their correct place in the bird's heads but have been omitted from the human faces. This is a variation from Ijo fashion, for the Ijo represent the eyes in such headdresses by cylinders standing vertically below the forehead. These ulaga carvings are not slavish copies of Ijo work but are re- interpretations. Their age is estimated at about twenty years, and the fact that they are the work of different carvers suggests that the form has been in existence with the Ibo for some time. FIG. 6. 'ULAGA FROM IDEMILI The other variety is illustrated by an oji onu from Agulu, south of Awka (fig. 3), and by an ulaga from Idemili, south of Onitsha (fig. 4). In the general form of human face, horns, pots of medicine and ichi marks it resembles figs. i and 2, but the 'mouth' is severely rectangular and is not recognizable as that of a bird. Since birds' beaks occur frequently in Ibo carving it is unlikely that the shape of these 'mouths' is due merely to the clumsiness of the carvers. Their form may be due to fantasy combined with memories of Ijo carvings. Ibo carvers do not usually attempt veri- similitude, and when they do it is apparently because the chosen form corresponds to an imaginative conception. An oji onu with a different type of carving, seen perform- ing at Ozubulu near Newi in I938, and called oji onu egbu oji, confirms that birds, and not fish or animals, are meant to be represented (fig. 7). The headdress is a rectangular box, ornamented with mirrors, with a large wooden beak sticking out in front. The wearer spoke with a hoarse and quivering voice and walked withl careful bird-like steps supporting himself on a stick. No part of his body was visible, for the ends of his trousers and sleeves were closed like bags and a cloth covered his face. Another variety of the basic type, an iilaga from Idemili, is shown in fig. 8. In this the rectangular mouthpiece has been shaved off to a more bird-like shape. iEsthetically it is a less effective design than figs. I and 4, giving a feeling of being unfinished or of indecision. It is probably the work of a carver who had the desire but lacked the skill to break away from the prototvpe. The headdresses showni in figs. 5 and 6 are from Okigwi District, which is the farthest east that this style has spread in the Ibo country. They come frolim different clans, but both have square 'cheeks' and no horns. A peculiar variety of an (ji oniii at Idemili is shown in fig. 9 and is suggestive as evidence that the design with the head looking up at the sky is not of Ibo origin. In this case FIG. 9. 'OjI ONU FROM IDEMILI the carving has the face in an upright and normal position and is more like the usual Ibo style. The dancer, however, looks out through a cloth below the headdress, which is made up of two masks fitted back to back or against a ruff of raffia. The elements that make up the previous carvings can be recognized: the human face, the bird's beak and the horns. The horns are on the sides of the face and end in a human head. On top of the mask is a cock, whose two tail feathers can be seen hanging over the top of the rear mask. This carving appears to be unique in Onitsha, but near Port Harcourt there are masks, probablv copied from the Ogoni tribe, which have mouths in the form of birds' beaks. Carved anthropomorphic heads, usually with horns and worn on top of the head, also occur in various places about the Benue River, but not along the Cross River. There is no existing geographic connexion between the Ijo and Benue work: the Ijo style has disappeared along the Niger before the Benue type begins. 2</page></plain_text>
