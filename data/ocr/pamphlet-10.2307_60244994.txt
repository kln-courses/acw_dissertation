This is the subject of which I propose to treat. No theme can be conceived more noble or more great, more intimately connected with the dear¬ est interests of individuals, and more absolutely conditioning the welfare of society. Yet not alone by reflection on the intrinsic importance and dignity of the matter has the choice of the essayist been determined, but also by the considera¬ tion that the question of Education is fast approaching the close of the empirical or experimental period, and that all the facts point to a speedy and satisfactory solution of the problem. It is always good that the theoretically desirable should coincide with the actually opportune; and that the general recognition of an imperative necessity should confirm the conclusions of specu¬ lative science by the ultima ratio of immediate expediency. In this stage, discussion is especially valuable and acceptable, since it gives especial promise of probable fruit. And that this stage has been reached in'the present instance, is apparent to every one who has observed the course of public opinion and the ten¬ dency of political action for the past few years. It is true that the classes to be instructed, the kind of instruction to be given, and the manner in which that instruction ought to be given, still afford a margin for debate—wide as the interval from the Eight Honourable the Member for Tamworth to the Very Reverend the Rector of the Catholic University—significant as the divergence in estimation of religious education between his Eminence the TDardinal Primate of Dublin and the titular Arch¬ bishop thereof. But the very acrimony of opposition evidences the mutual intensity of feeling and, perhaps, the mutual honesty' 2</page><page sequence="4">of conviction. And although those are yet to be found who would avowedly pervert the free republic of letters to a selfish oligarchy, fortunately for the common good, their sentiments are now in less repute than formerly, and a comprehensive system of useful education promises to become, day by day, more and more generally recognized as the indispensable condition of mental progress and material prosperity. Encouraged, then, by the tone of public thought, but nevertheless remembering that the appa¬ rent, and to a considerable extent real, unanimity of demand for useful education veils much and grave discordance on many par¬ ticulars of the highest importance, it will be the object of the essayist, by an impartial, utilitarian method, by a free and full examination of the fundamental ideas involved in the subject, to arrive at and impart an useful knowledge of the essential consti¬ tutive elements of such a system of Public Education as may satisfy the social and political requirements of a civilized and Christian nation in this, the nineteenth, century of Christian civilization. I. In considering the general question of Education, we may ob¬ serve it from any one of many points of view, and make use of, with greater or less propriety, any one of many principles of classification, according as we have occasion to consider it in this or that relation, or, in other words, according to the respec¬ tive utility of different points of view for certain given purposes. Accordingly, I must discard as adventitious to my present pur¬ pose many principles of classification which might otherwise possibly be fruitful of philosophical results. To me the ques¬ tion, What is the aim of Education? unfolds the subject in a triple aspect. And the method of convenient analysis and in¬ vestigation may be best pursued by regarding the general question of Education as comprehending the three distinct questions of Professional, Literary, and Political Education. II. With regard to Professional Education, whether we take it in its largest sense, as including all those species of instruction by</page><page sequence="5">which men learn to obtain a livelihood for themselves by minis¬ tering to the necessities or satisfying the desires of their fellows, or in the narrower sense, in which a real or conventional dis¬ tinction has caused the title of Profession to appertain to certain pursuits to the exclusion of all others, it does not appear un¬ reasonable to think that there is no imperative demand for exhor¬ tation to the cultivation of studies, which will always find their most efficient advocate in the powerful promptings of self- interest and individual incliuation. It is true that from a public point of view it is always a matter of policy that the greatest possible number of citizens should be placed beyond the tempta¬ tions of indigence and saved from the sad necessity of public charity, or what passes for such. It is also true that eventu¬ alities may not unnaturally arise in which the public happiness may be in no small degree dependent upon professional skill, and, indeed, in a manner, it is the aggregate of professions which makes up the state. But, so long as professions are generally adopted and due facilities for such adoption generally afforded, it cannot be a matter of much importance, politically speaking, what profession may be followed in any particular instance, and there would be small reason to anticipate a benefit from the interference of authority with the healthy principles of private interest and free competition. III. Neither would it be advisable to enter on a disquisition re¬ garding that second subdivision which we have distinguished in the general question of Education. The subjects grouped under the head of Literary Education, and usually confounded under the incomprehensible designation of Arts, are debarred from consideration, partly from the fact that the advantages to be derived from such studies have been already sufficiently set forth and, perhaps, exaggerated by writers of every calibre, and sufficiently recognized, at least in theory, by the bulk of society, and partly from the fact that rules could not easily be set to de¬ termine in what proportions literary accomplishments should enter into the education of each one of a multitude of indi¬ viduals, differing infinitely inter se in chaiacter, capacities, and</page><page sequence="6">4 pursuits. However, in spite of these inherent uncertainties and diificulties, it is nevertheless true that there is no sufficient reason why the want of scholarship so often displayed by pro¬ fessional men should not be at least mitigated by some arrange¬ ment of studies which would make the attainment of a certain amount of literary knowledge incumbent on every professional student. A measure, therefore, which would offer stronger im¬ mediate inducements to professional students to be conversant with, at least, the rudiments of Literary Education, would, I opine, be no small improvement on the mass of educational spe¬ culations now on their trial. There is no so imperative necessity for the pedantic adherence to the forms of mediseval instruction which still hang around modern universities. We have dis¬ carded the science, and retain little of the spirit of the middle ages. The modern mind runs in grooves of thought other than of old. And, though we may not have been always wise in our rejections, though philomediasvalism is often pardonable as the amiable weakness of retrospective minds, and sometimes laud¬ able as the judicious result of independent observation, it yet would be a hardy assertion, that the development of modern civilization has not, on the whole, proceeded in conformity with the instincts of progress in the best sense of that expression. We are the ancients of the earth. Why continue wearing the trappings of our childhood, the small clothes of our under¬ growth? Utility is the watchword of our era. Why, then, cling so fondly to effete distinctions from mere sentimental reasons A was an Archer and 3 was a Bow, may have been at one time no inappropriate method of instruction. It suited a certain stage of intellectual development. The forms of medi- sevalism may have had a like comparative utility. At any rate, aberration can have scarcely been so marked in the beginnings of things as it becomes at a distance from the source. But neither argument nor analogy can afford a reason why the Faculty of Arts should still remain the irrelevant title of a hete¬ rogeneous mass of studies which are not arts, and by its arbitrary designation, suggesting the idea of a profession, only serve as a bar to useful knowledge by the operation of that process so fami¬ liar to mediocre minds, which ever tends to transmute nominal</page><page sequence="7">distinctions into real ones, and erect into an independent system what primarily is nothing but the complement and adjunct of Professional and Political Education. IV. The all-important question of Political Education next presents itself to our consideration, and claims our most serious attention. For, if it appears that it is to Political Education we must look for the satisfaction of those higher requirements on which the social union depends, and the fulfilment of that higher des¬ tiny to which social man is always tending, the time cannot be considered wasted which we devote to this profound and en¬ nobling investigation; and where nevertheless so little accurate treatment, not to say so much culpable negligence, has been displayed, there is at least room for an attempt at elucidation. Since the Christian era, Political Education has been generally recognized, though always generally, as to a great extent it is at present, confusedly and indistinctly, as that education which incul¬ cates the ends and objects of political organization, the respective rights and duties of men in political society, and the knowledge of the means by which citizens may perpetuate the institutions and accomplish the amendments to which they have been deter¬ mined by rational considerations of the common welfare and the sacred obligations of Christian morality. And even among those who do not know and do not recognize the overshadowing claims of Christian religion and Christian morality, the other elements of the definition have remained unaltered, and Political Education has been declared to be the study of social facts in order to the right providing of the things pertaining to the common weal, ad omnia circa Bene Esse civitatis. And, though the study of social facts in this latter sense, or, to the systematic ignoral of the predominant fact of Christianity, is strikingly sug¬ gestive of the tale of the play of Hamlet with Hamlet's part omitted, the anatomy of the fallacy may be safely postponed to another time, when we shall investigate more thoroughly the labyrinthine error of that modern pseudo-philosophy to whom it has remained to sever the ancient union between Christian morality and national prosperity, and by a dishonest juggle cast</page><page sequence="8">discredit on the grand old Christian political maxim, Quod est ad Dei gloriam est ad bonum commune. The wisest and the best in every age have upheld the neces¬ sity of Political Education as indispensable to the maintenance of social and political rights and the performance of social and political obligations. The accurate Austin has but summarised the doctrines of his greatest predecessors when he declares that the principal cause of tyranny or bad government is ignorance on the part of the multitude of sound 'political science (in the largest sense of the expression): that is to say, political economy, with the two great branches of ethics, as well as politics, in the strict acceptation of the term. And if such be the principal cause of tyrannous or bad government, the principal preventive of the evil must lie in the diffusion of such knowledge through¬ out the mass of the community. Thus the great French economists of the eighteenth century maintained all constitutional reform to be futile which did not provide for the enlightenment of the community generally. In order, say the economists, to the being of a good government, two things must preexist: 1. Knowledge by the bulk of the people of the elements of political science; 2. A numerous body of citizens versed in political science, and not misled by interests conflicting with the common weal, who may shape the political opinions and steer the politi¬ cal conduct of the less profoundly informed, though instructed and rational, multitude. Without that knowledge in the bulk of the people, and without that numerous body of gens lumineux —light-diffusing citizens—the government, say the economists, will surely be bad, be it a government of one or a few, or be it a government of many. Thus, too, the profound and philosophic Hobbes rests his defence of absolutism on the positions: that good and stable government is simply or nearly impossible unless the fundamentals of political science are known by the bulk of the people: that the bulk of the people are as capable of receiv¬ ing such science as the loftiest and proudest of their superiors in station, wealth, or learning: and that, where such political edu¬ cation has been provided, there can be small danger of an abso¬ lute monarch misusing his authority; while, where such educa¬ tion has been culpably neglected or criminally suppressed, a</page><page sequence="9">quasi-representative government may be all the more pernicious to the common weal, so far forth as it clothes itself with the pretence of popular sanction, and masks the promptings of class interest under the guise of public providence and benevolent authority. The same principles are inculcated by the greatest of English economists, the illustrious thinker whose keen science has done so much to laying bare the rooted mischiefs which have impeded the free action of the great English democracy, and to whose wise prevision we look for an emphatic enunciation of the only means by which the English race can rise to the level of their lofty destiny, and make amends to all futurity for the evils which their stupid oligarchism and selfish semi-civiliza¬ tion have inflicted on mankind. " Without entering into dis¬ putable points", says Stuart Mill, " it may be asserted without scruple, that the aim of all intellectual training for the mass of the people should be to qualify them for forming a sound prac¬ tical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded. Whatever in the intellectual department can be superadded to this is chiefly ornamental, while this is the indispensable ground* work on which education must rest". Yes. We accept the pro¬ position. An education directed to diffuse good sense among the people, with such knowledge as would qualify them to judge of the tendency of their own actions, the working of public insti¬ tutions, and the expediency of legislative enactments, must be something more than a mere education of words or a mere culti¬ vation of taste and sensibility. It must be something more practical than literature or calfesthetics. Not that I would dis¬ countenance the rational study of the tongues of Greece and Rome. The glorious thoughts enshrined within those envelopes, the relations in which they stand to great world-questions of history and civilization, all, all unite in claiming at our hands study and appreciation. But while we acknowledge them to be a means, it cannot be admitted that they are the great end of Education. V. The Hellenes styled the uncivic citizen whom a selfish inert¬ ness withdrew from the performance of political duties JSuirtjc;</page><page sequence="10">w- and we may fitly apply the ancient designation, coloured by its modern meaning, to the human being whom a miserable epicu¬ reanism or a debasing indifference perverts from his allotted duties—who can accept the benefits of social intercourse, and enjoy the protection of political organization, without a social feeling or a grateful exertion, constantly contented to protract a vegetable existence on the hypothesis that some one else Avill rule and care him. Nor can we accord a much higher position to the hereditary radical or the hereditary conservative, who, without an intelligible principle or a political perception, but because of birthright bias and congenital distortion, is content to growl and growl or fawn and fawn a lifelong vacuum through. We want, then, an education proceeding by the method of assisted and independent thought, and calculated to train the minds of men to the recognition of their social and political rights and duties, to the knowledge of the ways and means of maximising human happiness and ennobling human nature under the guidance of the sovereign principles of the public good and Christian morality. For these sovereign principles may be thus considered as constituting an inseparable duality. They each denote the same fundamental idea. And while each especially characterizes, for the purpose of convenient analysis, one par¬ ticular phase of the fundamental thought, each, properly under¬ stood, implies the other, and they are summed up in the vcord Civilization. Surely literature is only useful for the lessons it contains. If, then, Greek and Roman literature be chosen as the media of instruction, it is at least necessary that the lessons which they teach should be rendered available ~bj the adoption of some ra¬ tional principle of study and prelection. A course of political philosophy might fitly serve as the introduction and consort of classical learning; and, when the mind had been trained to the observation of social and political phenomena, there might be some hope of deriving an useful benefit even from the single study of the customs, literature, and social life of nations dead a score of centuries. It has been too much forgotten, that, while the materials- of knowledge vary through the changes of the years, the mental constitution of man remains essentially invaria-</page><page sequence="11">9 ble in its capacity, limits, and necessity of training, and must present the same typical characteristics through all time. It has been too much forgotten, that the necessity of rational edu¬ cation exists at least as strongly in the nineteenth century as in the ninth, and that the development of intellect must pro¬ ceed not by contravening, but by obeying the laws of mind. It has been too much forgotten, amid the silly vapouring about " human freedom1' and " comprehensive reason", with which our ears have been stunned, that the human mind is incapable or potent, the blind slave of some misleading cant or the ex- haustless fountain of creative thoughts, just as we reject or accept the order of nature, just as we cast it adrift, the sport of chance, to waste its godlike powers in aimless efforts, or direct it, according to the teachings of experience and the conclusions of science, to some grand end of general utility, the perception of which will guide it in the selection of its instances and the application of its knowledge. The necessity then exists of fol¬ lowing some rational system which will guide and utilize our studies. To cast the untrained mind upon a complex subject, without assigning an end to which studies ought to tend, and to tell it, in the spirit of the most primitive and unphilosophical empiricism, " select for yourself", " assume that experience has done nothing before you, that system and science may be safely disregarded", is to nullify all previous investigation, to affirm the inutility of all regulated research, and for ever to throw back society to the intellectual stage from which it may be supposed to have started on the pursuit of knowledge. In any of the mental or material sciences, such a proceeding would meet with certain condemnation; but what all men would reject in this or that particular science, is precisely the approved method in that study of ancient literature which passes as a general education for modern youth. For, as it is, nothing can surpass the absence of all system and the utter want of all definite aim which the studies called " classical" present. Languishing love songs, boisterous- drinking songs, fierce philippics, misanthropic epigrams, snatches of political or theosophic discussion, the quips of knavish domestics, the follies of disreputable elders, the amours of dissipated bachelors, are hurried before the mental</page><page sequence="12">10 vision of the suckling humanist in a bewildering phantasmagoria, which is dimly and distractedly repeated in unconnected recol¬ lections of " Quis midta gracilis te puer in rosa ?"—" Hem,! Dromo, Dromo"—and " Catalina evasit". This is not as it should be. Such a provocative to mental indigestion cannot be regarded as an equivalent or substitute for Political Education Neither is society governed by the laws of acatalectic tetrameters, nor will the detection of the pseudo-Phaleric correspondence lead logi¬ cally to the detection of the economic fallacies of my Lord Dufferin. I speak in metaphor. I perhaps exaggerate the case against " classical" studies. But none the less do my words convey a solemn truth. All error is mal-education. Social man must be trained to the knowledge of his position in society. And although peculiarly constituted and highly original intel¬ lects may regaid it as a paradox, yet the common sense of man¬ kind will accept it as a truism, that, however interesting and sensational may be hypothetical conjectures about the Eleusinian mysteries, and the rites of the Bona Dea. yet, for all social and political purposes, for all the purposes for which men emphati¬ cally live, our intelligent youth might as well be learning how they chin-chin Joss in China, or worship mighty Mumbo Jumbo in the Mountains of the Moon. But, even at the best, I strongly doubt if Greek and Roman literature should be chosen as the exclusive media of instruc¬ tion. It is scarcely consonant with reason and policy to model the education of a modern country on the hypothesis, that its youth should learn to be citizens of the Dead Past instead of the Living Present, and that to be, in views, feelings, and asso¬ ciations, Antediluvians or Athenians, is the most fitting prepa¬ ration for performing the duties of modern citizenship. Granted that the fullest facilities should be afforded for the cultivation of the various literary inclinations of individuals, it remains cer¬ tain that the method of the public instruction should be such as to prepare every citizen of the country, in the first place, for the performance of his contemporary political and social duties by a sound political education, which, proceeding from the ob¬ servation of facts, ethic and economic, will insure an adequate knowledge of those fundamental principles on which modem</page><page sequence="13">11 society, as distinguished from ancient and hypothetical, essentially depends. VI. Assuming that mathematics without their special sphere can at most induce general habits of exactitude, and that rfo very strong analogy exists between the principles of taxation and the properties of a parallelopiped; then, since any benefit, other than private delectation, derivable from the study of ancient literature, presupposes a mind trained by political studies to discover the springs of public action under the shifting phases of social phenomena; since the irregular efforts of undisciplined ability are naturally unequal to the conduct of calculations so important and intricate as those which make up the business of the citizen, and so peculiarly liable to the perversions of self-in¬ terest and the misleading influence of "impassioned terms"; and since it is not good that the benefits of authority should be marred or its abuse encouraged by the irrational opposition or the irrational acquiescence of an uninstructed and unreflecting multitude, it follows that the establishment of a sound political education, based upon the sure foundations of an enlightened utilitarianism, can only be neglected with the certainty of per¬ petuating a pernicious ignorance, and at the peril of being sus¬ pected to have a base interest in such perpetuation. The nations ought not to be enfranchised, for the nations are in ignorance, say the oligarchs. Oligarchs, for centuries you have had all power of instruction in your own hands, and for every excess which has arisen from your culpable neglect of political educa¬ tion before Heaven and Earth you are responsible. Next, following the indications afforded by the best writers, we may, without difficulty, arrive at the interdependent and in- terillustrative sciences which must unite to constitute political education. Since, so far forth as the public wealth is conducive to the public happiness, every portion of wealth represents a portion of happiness; since, so far forth as the public morality is conducive to the public happiness, every portion of morality re¬ presents a portion of happiness; since the advancement of the public happiness is the proper object of all social union and political organisation; and since the conclusions of public science</page><page sequence="14">12 require the illustration of historical examples; we must accept the conclusion that to the constitution of a complete political education must be united as inseparable elements the science of the laws of the production, distribution, and exchange of wealth, the science which investigates the nature of moral dis¬ tinctions and the influence of moral principles, the science which directs public opinion and political action to the true means of maximising the common happiness, together with the philosophical observation of the development of political societies as exhibiting the workings of fundamental social laws and the progressive effects of formative ideas. Behold, then, in Economic Science, in the Science of Ethics, in General Juris¬ prudence, and the Philosophy of History, the grand Quadrivium of modern education. Here I anticipate an objection. " Granted that this is the high ideal of political instruction, yet studies so profound and so endlessly connected with all branches of human knowledge are naturally above the capacities of all but the hereditary statesmen whose birth and title necessarily qualify them for political leader¬ ship". This objection has Noodle been making so long time as High Conservativism has existed, and this objection will Noodle continue to make until High Conservativism shall have been emptied into its appropriate receptacle. But with all due defer¬ ence to the hereditary intelligence of that aristocratic personage, and with all due allowance for the right divine of Twopence- Halfpenny to look down on Twopence, it is not at all so certain, a priori, that the mass of the citizens are really naturally unfitted for such an education as would qualify them for forming a sound practical judgment of the circumstances by which they are surrounded, since into this political education practically resolves itself. We quote the absolutist Hobbes tlwt the mass of the citizens are as capable of understanding the fundamentals of political science as the loftiest and proud¬ est of their "superiors" in station, wealth, or learning; and we unhesitatingly declare that, at the furthest, such objection can only be valid as affecting the degree and not the kind of education. Granting that all men are not equally advantaged to attain a high proficiency, it is certain that the fundamentals</page><page sequence="15">of political science are within the understanding of all, and it re¬ mains the duty of those to whom society has lent its powers for the advancement of the common welfare, to provide for the due diffusion of such knowledge throughout the mass of the commu¬ nity. We superadd a grave consideration, strong in all the strength of selfishness, to which we respectfully invite the at¬ tention of reluctant oligarchs, and for which we expect with some show of confidence, that their hereditary love of a whole skin will plead to gain a favourable hearing. We would be un¬ derstood to ask, Is it not true that where sound political science is persistently denied to the bulk of the people, a gate is only left open and a premium offered for the subtle propagation of quasi-popular opinions, whose influence, if often, as might be expected, unproductive of the maximum of popular prosperity, is at least pretty generally completely effective of oligarchic ruin VII. No difficulty need be apprehended from the apparent or real magnitude of the subject. Granting that such a profound and comprehensive study of all the facts, ethic and economic, as would be necessary for estimating the whole causes operating over a wide extent of space and time, might be the all-absorbing labour of a life; yet it remains certain that no such intense appli¬ cation is required for the acquisition of that limited portion of useful knowledge which can qualify a citizen for the duties of citizenship. On the contrary, it would be very easy to construct and carry out such a plan of studies as would completely satisfy the conditions of the problem. For, while every encouragement should be afforded for the profounder prosecution of political studies, the constitution of an useful course, adapted to meet the general requirements, might be easily arrived at by the use of some such competent treatise upon economic science as the famous work of Stuart Mill, the attendance upon fifty lectures in a single session, or the same number divided over two sessions, and the instructions of a lecturer able and willing to supply, from the related sciences, facts and principles to confirm the conclusions of the great economist, where accurate, or to correct</page><page sequence="16">14 them where his materialissimism has sometimes clouded his fine genius and led him to the adoption of startling theories whose operation would strangely antedate our era If we are to have a model university—and a model university I need not say would be pretty nearly at the opposite pole to most of the educational systems with which I am acquainted—it will be an indispensable condition that some such course of education shall be incumbent on all its alumni. We adopt the opinions of those great French economists who maintained all constitutional re¬ form to be futile which did not provide for the enlightenment of the community generally, and we would hold such an inesti¬ mable advantage to be cheaply purchased by the compulsory incorporation of political science in the curriculum of studies, by superadding copious inducements to the profounder acquisition of such useful knowledge, and by making the all-important pro¬ fessorships appurtenant, not the worst, but the best paid of chairs. The diffusion of political knowledge is the primary ground of public interference, as distinguished from private enterprise, in matters of education; and I cannot admit that any educational system merits the status of public, which has not the diffusion of such political knowledge as the chief object of its institution, however successful it may be otherwise in expatriating its alumni to interesting stations at Bundlegunge and Boggley Wollah, in order to their incorporation with that Great British Universal Civilizing Machine, which has hitherto worked in India with its usual success. VIII. At this stage of the discussion it might not be inappropriate to consider briefly the sphere and limits of governmental inter¬ ference in matters of education, and perhaps the most accurate views on the subject cannot be better expressed than by follow¬ ing the reasoning of Stuart Mill. Granting that there are cer¬ tain primary elements and means of knowledge, which it is in the highest degree desirable that every human being born into the community should acquire, both because the benefits of knowledge are in the highest degree useful to every individual member of society, and because the common interests of the community require to be guarded against the pernicious conse-</page><page sequence="17">15 quences of ignorance and want of education in the citizens; it hence follows that it is an allowable exercise of authority by the government, as the guardian of the public interests and the ex¬ pression of the public sentiment, to make education, at least to such an extent as will insure a practical knowledge of political science, a matter of legal obligation. " But", continues Mill, " one thing must be strenuously insisted on—that the government must claim no monopoly for its education, either in the lower or in the higher branches; must exert neither authority nor influence to induce the people to resort to its teachers in preference to others; and must confer no peculiar advantages on those who have been instructed by them. It is not endurable that a government should, either in laiv or in fact, have a complete control over the educa¬ tion of the people. To possess such a control, and actually exert it, is to be despotic. A government which can mould the opinions and sentiments of the people from their youth upwards, can do with them whatever it pleases". It will be perceived that this reasoning, perfectly valid as far as it goes, and always capable of the utmost generalisation, is yet coloured by the assumption, which unfortunately is generally true, that government is something different from, and possibly antagonistic to, the people. In this case it is undeniable that where government has assumed, or tends to assume, the status of a dominant caste, it would be sounding the death-knell of civil liberty to permit it to engross the education of the people, and to mould the sentiments of the national youth in servile confor¬ mity with the interests of that dominant caste. It might be one of the greatest misfortunes which could happen a nation that a government which was anything but the conscientious guardian of the national interests, should have it in its power to pervert the young minds of the country, by the judicious suppression of obnoxious information within the authorised institutions, and by the judicious bait of government patronage beyond, to subserve its hostile interests in the perpetuation of degrading anomalies and gigantic frauds. To a government, then, of this description, which' is, or is possibly, influenced by any other motives than the public utility, the reasonings of Stuart Mill are applicable in their fullest extent.</page><page sequence="18">16 But it is to be observed, that the objections of Mill to a monopoly of education by the government apply with a con¬ stantly diminishing force as the government approaches the form of truly popular. For where a government is truly popular, where it truly represents the intelligent requirements of the citizens, it would be difficult to prove what evils could flow from the subjection of the popular education to the control and super¬ vision of the parties most interested, that is, of the people or government, since in this case the terms are synonymous. But so long as a government retains the character of being foreign or unnational and oligarchical, so long, in fine, as it is not strictly true that the governed govern and the governors are governed, the conclusions of Mill follow as truths of demonstration. " Tliough, for the purpose of disseminating useful knowledge, a government may, and in many cases ought to, establish schools and colleges, it must neither compel nor bribe any person to come to them; nor ought the power of individuals to set up rival estab¬ lishments to depend in any degree upon its authorization. It would be justified in requiring from the people that they shall possess instruction in certain things, but not in prescribing to them how or from whom they shall obtain it". IX. The public endowment of educational institutions is a necessary corollary of the recognition of useful education as a matter most intimately connected with the public welfare. And I cannot but think, when the nation has once determined to devote a portion of the public contributions or taxes to the encourage¬ ment of education, that, at least in order to the diffusion of political knowledge, considerations of expediency would point to the extension of the principle of subvention or assistance to the making of education free or gratuitous to all the citizens. For what is to the general advantage should be supported at the general expense, and not imposed as a particular burthen upon a portion of the community. And I cannot but regard the setting of a price upon the acquisition of political knowledge as a pernicious tax, levied at the most inopportune moment, with the smallest possible advantage to the coffers of the state, and</page><page sequence="19">17 imposed upon the persons who least of .all should be subjected to such a peculiar burthen, namely, those who, from a public point of view, are favourably distinguished from all others through their praiseworthy resolution to prepare themselves for the per¬ formance of their duties as citizens by making themselves ac¬ quainted with the science of citizenship. Proceeding then on the assumption, and on any other assumption political science is impossible, that the public welfare is the sole end of that com¬ mon action of the governed which is called government, and that a thorough measure of useful education is a necessary means to that end, it logically follows that the endowment of such systems of public education as, with the least possible shock to the feelings of different classes where different classes exist, will prepare the citizens for the duties of citizenship, is in the highest degree a matter of public expediency and legislative action. X. Here we enter upon a discussion where it seems to have been the fashion to talk the most stupendous nonsense in a sort of mock-proportion to the gravity of the subject, and, what is a remarkable feature, where men who have never been known to display any symptoms of aberration in ordinary matters, have suddenly become so incomprehensibly irrational as almost to jus¬ tify the suspicion that they have only assumed the cloak of folly to mask some sinister intention. Yet it is a subject which, though profound and important, and even the profoundest and the most important, is so entirely free from ambiguity, that if we only follow the usual method of reasoning, we cannot fail to com¬ prehend it with sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes. Should Public Education be Religious? or in other words, should the necessity of religious knowledge be recognized in an educational system which assumes to suit the requirements of a Christian people? This is the question for discussion. And we may best proceed in its consideration by investigating con¬ secutively the stock objections, pseudo-political and pseudo- liberal, which are wont to be produced in support of the negative. 2</page><page sequence="20">18 XI. We will commence with the pseudo-political objections, or those which assume to be supported by the positions of political science; and clearness and distinctness in our analysis will be best preserved by investigating the most general form of the fallacy under examination before proceeding to the particular case. " Government education ought not to be religious, because it is no part of the province of government to countenance the dis¬ semination of religious knowledge". In the first place, it may be observed that the statement of this objection unveils a very instructive example of that popular fallacy known as arguing in a circle, and which consists in the dexterous repetition, through the medium of plausible synonyms, of the proposition which re¬ quires to be proved, and then assuming that by the repetition the proposition has been proved. As if one would say, in the instance given by Whately, " to allow every man absolute free¬ dom of speech must always be on the whole advantageous to the state; for it is highly conducive to the interests of the commu¬ nity, that each individual should enjoy an unlimited liberty of expressing his- sentiments". In the second -place, this obj ection in reality proceeds upon a total misconception of the true office of government. It negatives all the relations which ought to exist between a government and the governed. It is a mon¬ strous anomaly, which cannot be supported by a single argument that is not destructive of all political science itself. For so far from its being universally true that a government ought not to support religious education, it may very possibly happen, accord¬ ing to the requirements of the governed, that the obligation may lie all the other way. Government is no capricious and hyper- physical being, whose resolutions are inscrutable, for whose actions there is no accounting, and whose slightest favours should be re¬ ceived with prostrate gratitude. Government is no such thing. It is simply a number of citizens to whom is committed the super¬ vision of the public interests in order to the satisfaction of the pub¬ lic requirements, and whose hands are strengthened by the com¬ mon forces to the attainment of the common happiness or good. Such is the republican ideal of government, the ideal which poli-</page><page sequence="21">10 tical science contemplates; and so far as any existing government departs from this ideal, so far it departs from what it ought to be. The rational requirements of the community should then be considered as binding on those qui citram oommunitatis habent. And if, regardless of its obligations, a government persists in enforcing a system of measures which the public sense rejects, such unconstitutional proceedings are emphatically outrages rather than laws, and should be repelled by every means which expediency inculcates on citizens, in order to the maintenance of the sacred sanctions and safeguards of constitutional society. Thus, then, so far from there being any inherent reason why a government ought not to give effect to the requirements of the governed in the matter of religious education, on the con¬ trary, it becomes obligatory on it to support that educational system which the public wishes point to, rather than any other, and, unless it is prepared to prove that such religious education is generally pernicious, to support it absolutely. Therefore, if the requirements of a Christian people point to a system of Christian education, it is incumbent on the government, in the first place, to give effect to such requirements unless at least it is prepared to prove that Christian education is a thing gene¬ rally pernicious. And, even though it were considered gene¬ rally pernicious in the enlightened opinion of a pseudo-tolerant government, still, if the nation remained unconvinced in the opposite belief, there are many high precedents on record which relate how such governments have ere now been compelled to pay the penalty of their inopportune enlightenment. But, a fortiori, if, so far from being a thing generally pernicious, the knowledge of that immense historical fact and system of social philosophy which is Christianity, is absolutely necessary to the right understanding of modern political society, as distinguished from ancient and hypothetical, then does the inseparable connec¬ tion of religious knowledge with every modern educational system, which would avoid the reproach of mischievous superfi¬ ciality, become a truth of demonstration. So far for the more pretentious form of the pseudo-political objection. A subordinate theory awaits examination. " Government ought not to support any particular system of</page><page sequence="22">20 religious education". I would observe, in the first place, that even if this objection were generally valid, it is worthless where it is affected with the glaring inconsistency of being applied only as against one system of religious education, while its pro- pounders do not feel themselves called on to apply it impartially as against any. Besides, even if this objection were fairly acted upon, and not merely brought forward as a specious pretext for a very questionable purpose, it entirely overlooks the probability of its being greatly to the general advantage of the community that the government, while carefully providing for the necessary diffusion of political knowledge, should afford the fullest facili¬ ties for the establishment of the various educational systems de¬ manded by different classes of citizens, all equally entitled to the protection of the common government alike against the domination of an alien religion and an alien irreligion. For the rest, this objection is only a particular case of the more general misconception which we have already investigated. XII. Having thus disposed of the two pseudo-political objections, or those which assume to be based on the positions of political science, we will now proceed to the consideration of those re¬ maining objections, which may be conveniently classed as pseudo-liberal, and which, while appealing copiously to such imposing but vague and misleading ideas as " freedom", " harmony", " progress", and so forth, resolve themselves in the last analysis into covert attempts to prove Christian education to be a thing generally pernicious—attempts, let me add, designed and directed aforethought by the scientific infidelity of professed or disguised rationalists, and furiously seconded by the unreason¬ ing intolerance of sectarian bigots in the worst, or north-Irish, sense of that expression. XIII. 1. " Religious education would produce national discord". In the first place, I question the sincerity of this objection. For when I remember the quarter from which it emanates, it seems certainly doubtful whether England does not fancy she has ia</page><page sequence="23">21 gained rather than lost by Irish disunion; although to us it does not appear so very certain that the means which England has adopted have really redounded upon the whole so greatly to her advantage. Secondly, it is not so very evident a priori that harmony and union would be in reality accelerated by the addi¬ tion of an irreligious sect to the various religious sects already in existence. And, thirdly, I absolutely deny the truth of the ob¬ jection. It is a falsehood and an impudent falsehood to assert that the disunion and miseries of Ireland have flown sponta¬ neously from religious teaching and religious convictions. On the contrary, every page of my wretched country's history proclaims the suggestive truth, that the reason why in Ireland men of dif¬ ferent creeds have not always lived and laboured, as in other countries, in the spirit of Christian fellowship and kindly patriotism, is that in Ireland religious differences have been carefully fanned from without. The policy of England has been for centuries sedulously directed to the pitting of religion against religion. Divide and govern, has been her motto. And, therefore, has she immemorially imported every selfish consideration which could inflame party hostility, and therefore has she constantly inculcated that the Christian precept, love your neighbour, should always yield to the diabolic precept, hate your neighbour, as often and as long as English greed had any thing to gain from Irish disunion. Let me add that I am more than ever confirmed in my position, that unpatriotic dissensions in Ireland are not the natural result of Christian teaching, but the unblessed consequences of foreign intrigue, by the fact that, in the teeth of a system of laws which offered a premium for the breach of every principle of honour and every commandment of charity, Ireland hath never wanted sincere and patriotic sons, who refused to allow their religious convictions to be perverted to the ruin of their country. Read ye, and with reverence read, the roll of Ireland's glorious dead. Did sec¬ tarianism dull the eloquence of Grattan? Would it have blunted, think ye, the bayonets of the Volunteers? Have we not known Emmet—nostras delicim—and the good Lord Edward Were not Curran, and Bushe, and Plunket, Protes¬ tant Does not Tom Steele sleep by O'Connell's grave Is</page><page sequence="24">22 still further proof required I summon a witness who cannot be suspected of partiality to Ireland—a British peer—a leader in the British senate. I summon Charles Earl Grey to give his testimony, so that we may learn whether in reality religious con¬ victions, as distinguished from foreign subornation, have uni¬ formly prevented Irishmen from taking common action in the interest of their common country. In a speech delivered by him in 1800, he thus bears witness to that grand unanimity with which the Irish nation spake its will that it would never recog¬ nize the transparent artifice and abominable wrong, by which the bought minions of Castlereagh attempted to afford a pretext for the definite suspension of the constitution and the definite provin- cialisation of our old heroic land. " Twenty-seven counties", said his lordship," have petitioned against the measure. The petition from the county of Down is signed by upwards of seventeen thousand respectable independent men, and all the others are in a similar proportion. Dublin petitioned under the great seal of the city, and each of the corporations in it followed the example. Drogheda petitioned against the union, and almost every other town in the kingdom in like manner testified its disapprobation. Those in favour of the measure, by the exertion of great influ¬ ence, obtained a few counter-petitions. Yet though the petition from the county of Down was signed by 17,000, the counter- petition was signed by only 415. Though there were seven hundred and seven thousand who had signed petitions against the measure, the total number of those who declared themselves in favour of it did not exceed three thousand, and many of these only prayed that the measure might be discussed. If the facts I state are true", continued the orator, " and I chal¬ lenge any man to falsify them, could a natio?i in more direct terms express its disapprobation of a political measure, than Ireland has done of a legislative union with Great Britain? In fact, the nation is nearlg unanimous, and this great majority is composed, not of bigots, fanatics, and jacobins, but of the most respectable of every class in the community'". Such was the testimony of the English noble; and, in significant confir¬ mation, Saurin arose in his ultra-Protestantism, and, with official deliberateness, gave shape and emphatic expression to the deep</page><page sequence="25">23 conviction and resolve of his compatriots. " Nothing", said he, " can make the union obligatory on conscience. It will be obeyed so long as England is strong, but resistance to it will be in the abstract a duty. And the exhibition of that resis¬ tance will be a mere question of prudence". The example of their chief found a ready response among the Irish Orange¬ men. From heart to heart the kindly flame leaped on, proving what it'could do with the most unlikely and most stubborn materials; and the 1st of March, 1800, saw two-and-thirty Orange lodges gloriously unite to place on record their in¬ dignant repudiation of the dishonest revolution which had struck down the constitution of their country, and hurried to an untimely doom the glorious promise of national independence. History has preserved their protest, and for that one good act of theirs might generous Ireland well forget them many an error of head and many an error of heart. Therefore, then, do we affirm that when Irish domestic interests shall cease to be at the mercy of persons practically irresponsible to Irish public opinion—when Caithness and Cornwall shall cease to intermeddle with what they do not care to understand—when Bungle and Bully shall cease their revolting alternation—when the constitution shall no longer be suspended—when the money-changers shall have been chased from the National Temple—though every man within that old assembly hall should sincerely worship the common Creator in a manner somewhat different from the rest of his countrymen, yet for all common interests, and not alone great state measures, whose startling necessity might strike even strangers, but the thousand and one instances where the com¬ mercial prosperity of a nation is vitally dependent on community of interest between the governed and the legislators—from land tenure and garrison ecclesiastics to Galway contracts—it will be found, as it would have been found, that religious convictions, when not criminally tampered with, never lead to national dis¬ union and national degradation. And therefore do we dismiss this objection as an atrocious and ignorant, if not deliberate, calumny on Christianity, trumped up for a purpose by twopenny loyalists, who would trail the Scriptures in the mire to satisfy the promptings of their servile adulation.</page><page sequence="26">24 2. " Religious education would produce religious bigotry". With regard to this objection, I would observe, in the first place, that though there may exist only too numerous examples of reli¬ gious bigots, as well Catholics as Protestants or anomalous, the worst bigotry of all is the bigotry of those who, in the in¬ sulted name of freedom, would force their negative rationalism and intrusive ignorance on the possessors of a positive creed. There was a time, fortunately not yet altogether past, when liberality did not mean monopoly, and when courtesy was generally understood to mark the educated man. But some in our day have endeavoured to reverse all this. These are they who, while they pour out wild invectives against the parti pritre, and liberally distribute choice phrases of vituperation on all who venture to differ from their narrow-minded arrogance, babble of " ultramontanism", and rave of " lay morality", and prate about "broad principles" with a foolish face of praise. In the second place, it may be said that this objection in the mouth of a professing Christian may fairly be construed as a damaging admission with regard to the practical social effect of those particular tenets of which he has had personal experience, and of whose working he is competent to speak. And, thirdly, I flatly deny that religious education necessarily produces reli¬ gious bigotry in the worst sense of that expression. And here I would be understood to observe that " religious bigotry" is one of those phrases, grandiloquent but undetermined, which form the stock-in-trade of a certain class of orators all the world over. For thus it is that men are the fools of phrases, and the idola fori remain the most inveterate of all illusions, twining themselves around and hampering the understanding by the associations of words and names. That religious educa¬ tion will probably produce religious consistency, I grant; but it is not at all so very certain that religious consistency ought to be generally matter of reproach. Toleration—what is the meaning of this toord It means, properly speaking, the patience with which we suffer a thing ivhich we judge to be bad, but which we think it desirable not to punish. When toleration is exercised in the order of ideas, it always supposes a misunderstanding or error. No one will say that he tolerates the truth, Thence it</page><page sequence="27">25 follows that the word toleration, as applied to opinion, always means the toleration of an error. He who says yes, thinks no i-s false; and he who says no, thinks yes is a mistake. This is only an application of the well-known principle, that it is impos¬ sible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time. Proceeding then with our inquiry, we shall discover that there are two kinds of tolerance and intolerance, which we may respectively call religious tolerance and intolerance, and infidel tolerance and intolerance. It is quite possible for religious and humane men to be very intolerant. Nay, in some circumstances it would be contrary to human nature to suppose them anything else. Men who have never had intercourse with any but the faithful, who have always heard religion spoken of with respect, and all whose holiest and tenderest associations twine themselves around the ancient altars, will be indignant, will be horrified at the first word they shall hear against the faith or ceremonies of the Church. The old man lifts his withered hands to invoke the swift anathema of Heaven. While his shearing sword descends in flashing, the Templar thunders, hoarse with passion: Die, dog of an unbeliever. But, on the other hand, the shock of novelty once over, and the recognition of a thousand common interests confirming the precepts of a common Christian charity, the different religious convictions of citizens will be no longer incom¬ patible with the unity of patriotism; petty insults and sectarian corruption will be contemptuously abandoned to the votaries of folly and the stipendiaries of scoundrelism; and the Irish Catholic and the Irish Protestant know no cause of fratricidal hate when they stand together, heart knit to heart, and shoulder to shoulder, for the good cause of Ireland. This, then, is religious tolerance. This is the tolerance founded on sincere conviction, mutual forbearance, and love of country, and this is the tolerance which it should be our duty to promote. Now, if we consider infidels, we will easily perceive that the fact of their infidelity does not at all prevent their being ex¬ tremely intolerant. There are men who not only have no religion, but who have an animosity against it, either on account of some fatal error they entertain, cuvijacause they find it an OF BRISTOL UBRARY</page><page sequence="28">2Q obstacle to their designs. These men are extremely intolerant, and their intolerance is the worst of all, because it is not accom¬ panied by any moral principle which can restrain it. This is a sad truth of which all history is the witness. Intolerant infi¬ delity has been the most merciless of persecutors; and even when axe and sword have been denied to his ready hand, who can rival the intolerant infidel- in uncompromising insolence, in abusive bigotry But there is another class of men who, though devoid of religion, are not strongly prejudiced against the faith. They live in a kind of scepticism, into which the reading of a corrupted literature or the observations of a superficial and frivolous philosophy, uncorrected by any sound education, have unfortunately led them; they are not attached to religion, but they are not its violent enemies. Many of them even acknow¬ ledge the importance of religion for the good of society. They may perhaps love to cherish the hope of being reconciled with the God of their fathers before they descend into the grave. These men are tolerant, but, if carefully examined, their toler¬ ance is not a principle or a virtue—it is only a necessity result¬ ing from their sad position. It is difficult to be intolerant of the opinions of others when we have none of our own. It is difficult to be violently opposed to religion when we consider it as a thing necessary for the good of society. It is difficult to cherish hatred against faith when perhaps we fix our eyes upon it as the last beam of hope amid the terrors of an unknown and an inevitable future. This is the helpless tolerance of a vacillating infidelity. But it may be doubted whether such unstable scepticism is in truth the grand ideal of all science and the glorious goal of human perfectibility, and it is not all so certain that we should accept a sign of progress and a principle of union in common forgetfulness of God. Said Mazzini, " We must corrupt a generation before the revolution can take root". Are then the lovers of Mazzini conscious of an intimate connection between the theory of the man they admire and the educational system which they themselves support 3. Beaten successively from position to position, the cham¬ pions of infidel education play their last desperate card, in the ob¬ jection: " Religious education ought to be left exclusively to the</page><page sequence="29">27 ministers of religion ". But, in the first place, if we remember that it is but brief time since all the outcry of pseudo-liberalism was against the monopoly of religious education by the ministers of religion, such a facility of variation cannot but excite sus¬ picion, and such a transparent inconsistency may not unreason¬ ably be regarded as dictated by expediency to serve the dishonest purpose of a subterfuge. Secondly, this objection is shallow, since it proceeds upon an ignorant depreciation of Christianity. For, if Christianity be anything more than a mere surface-polish or a mere subjective feeling—if it extends beyond the narrow bounds of church and cloister—if it per¬ meates all the strata of society, and influences all the social relations—if it is the immense historical fact and system of philosophy which throughout nineteen centuries hath been the centre of forces and the principle of development in modern political society, as distinguished from ancient and hypothetical,— then does the inseparable connection of Christian science with every modern educational institution which would avoid the reproach of pernicious superficiality, become a truth of demon¬ stration : and religious education must be extended beyond the province of purely priestly teaching, unless the glib objectors are prepared to fill the all-important chairs of political economy, ethics, history, and general jurisprudence with the ministers of religion alone. XIV. In fine, with regard to these pseudo-liberal objections, which resolve themselves at bottom into covert attempts to prove Christian education to be a thing generally useless or generally pernicious, we would observe that, granting Christianity to be possibly useless or possibly pernicious, it remains certain tkat there is no sufficient reason why we should accept this proposition as proven, on the mere assertion of persons probably as fallible as ourselves; and it follows from the great right of private inquiry, that the fullest opportunity should be afforded to us for the exercise of our independent judgments upon the whole and unmutilated facts of a system which, to say the least, has so many presumptions in its favour. Said Stuart Mill: " Since</page><page sequence="30">28 Christianity is a historical religion, Christian education should proceed by a historical method". And oertainly the searching and candid study of Christian history is a prerequisite, from the most material point of view, of any decision upon the subject. But we go further, and leaving to others the denun¬ ciation of infidel education in the terms and with the ceremonial of ecclesiastical anathema, we proceed to show, and for the pur¬ pose we have in hand such proof will be sufficient, that irreligious education is inevitably superficial, and in itself generally per¬ nicious. XV. We base our argument on the position, that where a civiliza¬ tion exists which owes not merely some accidental circum¬ stances, but all that is essential and characteristic, in fine, its whole principle of development, its entire being and continued existence, to the operation of certain obvious and inseparable causes, then the attempt to investigate and understand such civilization, to the systematic exclusion of these obvious and inseparable causes, can only produce a superficial, a mutilated, and a mischievous science. Attempt to analyze the civilization of Greece and Rome, and set out by assuming the non-existence or the non-significance of their religious institutions, conduct your inquiries with a systematic ignoral of these potent in¬ fluences, but do not be surprised if the conclusions you draw from your fanciful selections cannot coincide with the stubborn facts of positive reality. And if grave error may be confidently predicted to result from the pursuit of such a course with regard to the pagan social systems, a fortiori may it be counted on if we extend the application of this method of mistake to that European civilization which has grown up under Christian auspices. For, apart from esoteric speculations, the method of pagan superstition was so universally the mere apotheosis of human instincts and passions, that by generally recognizing the sovereignty of the passions, as a principle to argue from, in an analysis of the ancient civilizations, we may approximate to the facts of those civilizations with more exactitude than if the</page><page sequence="31">29 influence of pagan religion had been such, and so uniformly exerted, as to limit their empire and control their exercise. But, since Christianity is emphatically, what Stuart Mill has defined modern civilization to be, "in every one of its aspects a struggle against the animal instincts", we can never hope to arrive at a just estimate of that modern society which has been moulded by the teaching of Christian religion and morality, if, in the teeth of history and philosophy, we proceed by systematically elimi¬ nating all study of the fundamental institution which is the breath of the life of European civilization. XVI In the words of a great publicist, one of those illustrious minds of that cast of grave magnificence in which Spain has been so fruitful: " The spirit of Christianity circulates in the veins of modern society; its seal is set upon all legislation; its light is shed upon all branches of morals; its phraseology is found in all languages; its precepts regulate morals; habits and manners have assumed its form; the fine arts breathe its per¬ fume, and all the monuments of genius are full of its inspira¬ tions. Christianity, in a word, pervades all parts of that great, varied, and fertile civilization which is the glory of modern society". Since, then, it is no arbitrary date, no merely con¬ venient nomenclature, which distinguishes the modern from the ancient world; but, on the contrary, since it required the con¬ stant operation of a great system of moral and social philosophy to create from effete Romanism and untutored Barbarism the goodly frame of modem Europe, and since it is the constant operation of that same great system which in all the relations of the indi¬ vidual, the sexes, the family, and the state, has preserved in modern times, amid a hundred revolutions, that civil liberty and personal dignity which establish and limit the true sphere of political organization and action; thence it follows, with the force of the most unerring demonstration, that the Science of Christianity is inseparably united with every modern educational institution which would avoid the reproach of pernicious super¬ ficiality.</page><page sequence="32">30 XVII. At no time was the knowledge of the great principles, which form the real basis of civilization as we know it, more necessary than now, when an uncompromising Rationalism, which, pre¬ mising the non-significance of Christian religion, and conse¬ quently unacquainted with the true conditions of the problem that it attempts to solve, conclusively leads, if its assumptions are granted, to theories which, after nineteen centuries of progress, would repeat in our own day the debasing speculations of Plato and Aristotle, and leave us no alternative between the ferocious patriotism of Rome Republican and the desperate sensuality of Rome Imperial. Yes; if we grant its premises to Rationalism, we must accept its conclusions. If we grant the assumption, in the teeth of all experience, which is all history, that Christianity is unnecessary to our civilization, we must, unless society be dissolved into its individual elements, admit the despotism of a demoniac public utility, which we would vainly attempt to limit, as with bonds of sand, by the untenable restrictions of a timorous and vacillating sophistry, or desperately endeavour to forget amid the horrible excesses of a sensual delirium: let us eat and let us drink, for to-morrow we shall die. A first-class anarch, but a tenth-rate statesman, has declared that " Italy is not a revolution, but a religion". The vain man thinks to have enunciated a dogma of progress. Rather has he signed the confession of his own political impotence. It is only to be re¬ gretted that, among mediocre and undiscerning minds, the holy cause of universal liberty suffers, and must suffer, from such irrelevant vagaries of its pseudo-apostles. So far then is it from being generally true, that in a Christian country, amid a Christian civilization, religious education ought to be suppressed, it is on the contrary absolutely necessary that as many as possible of the citizens of that country should be educated to understand and appreciate the conditions of the social and political life by which they are surrounded. Educa¬ tion Political and Christian is the condition of Christian civiliza¬ tion. Education Political and Godless, or Education Godless alone, is the condition of Red Republicanism. Christian Education</page><page sequence="33">31 is thus an inseparable branch of the Political Education of a Christian state or polity; and the theory that stripling under- graduates should be denied a Christian education, is identical with the theory that even senseless children should be brought up as infidels, to strike out some chance creed and frame some sort of accidental opinions, according to the transient impulses of their own untutored fancy. And this is the reductio ad absurdum or ad diabolicum of the system. XVIII. Let me add some particular considerations adapted to the case of Ireland, which may confirm the general conclusions we have drawn. And, in the first place, if a collegiate course, conducted according to Presbyterian or Anglican religious principles, is distasteful to the coteries of Liberalism—if they avow that the teachings of their own religions should be shunned as alien to Christian harmony and national progress—if their own observa¬ tion and experience confirm their opinions in these familiar instances, and if they are led by a common, though inconsequent, induction to manifest their not unnatural distrust of their own here¬ ditary creeds by the choice of an educational system from which all religion is eliminated, by what right, may we ask, do they daie to attribute similar opinions to the Catholics of Ireland? What have they seen to encourage them to impute to the Catholic Irish a similar distrust of the teachings of Ireland's ancient and illustrious Church? Surely such a feeling is not evinced by those countless petitions that sought to wring from the London Parliament a charter for the Catholic University. We would warn, then, these shallow observers not to base their hopes on the weakened influence of the Irish clergy. That influence has never shown itself weakened, save where the Catholic precept of charity towards all men comes into collision with the national desire of vengeance on one kingdom of men. And we would admonish them to well believe that the faith of fourteen hundred years of national existence through glory, and gloom, and misery, and hope (for these are the four ages of Catholic Ireland, of which the last is the present), the faith of Patrick and Columba, of mitred Lawrence and of martyred Plunket, is not so lightly</page><page sequence="34">32 rooted in the hearts and recollections of Irishmen, that they now should welcome the new-fangled theories of merely material economists, and turn a deaf ear to the warning voices of their immemorial priesthood. If, then, it must be acknowledged that irreligious opinions upon education do not obtain among the Catholics of Ireland, by what flight of audacious intolerance do these pseudo-liberals presume to make their own darkened vision the limit of Catholic thought, and their own material speculations the laws of the Catholic mind? The enforcement of irreligious and unnational education was but another phase of that aggressive Anglicanism which has been for centuries the cause of all the miseries of Ireland. The fetter and the prison-house had failed; but what force could not ac¬ complish, fraud might yet effect. The means must be changed, the end remaining the same. The Irish could not be protestant¬ ized; they might be decatholicized, and at all events incidentally denationalized. For centuries an alien and hostile government had sought to impose the Anglican state system upon Ireland. With axe, and gibbet, and rack, and wheel, the Irish were " affectionately invited" to accept the novel worship of the stranger. The broad lands of their ancient clans were parcelled out among apt oppres¬ sors, apostate or imported. The great cathedrals of their fathers, built to hold a mightier faith, were handed over to the stern priests and scanty congregations of the persecuting creed. Now, indeed, the scene is somewhat changed. The headsman and the torturer are repugnant to the nineteenth century. Our own days have seen the gallows baulked. But still must weeping Ireland sadly view the felon usage of stainless gentlemen and soldiers—the too prompt champions of her outraged nationhood. Still doth the brisk bailiff ply against a people's homesteads the picks and crowbars of insensate landocrats, who will not see the Writing on the Wall. " Fertile our soil where honest men starve; Empty the mart, and shipless the bay s Out of our -want the oligarchs carve j Foreigners fatten on our deoay I" The alien churchmen still grow sleek on mass-money. The</page><page sequence="35">33 blood-cemented fabric of persecution still stands within our midst, in form a temple, but in reality a fortress, frowning down upon the helpless nation from which it extorts rations for its ample garrison. The imported oppressors, summoning insolence to the aid of insignificance, seek to brazen out the old injustice by audacious dictation and undisguised intolerance. And, just as in the mouths of Sussex, and Spenser, and Bacon, murder, and robbery, and arson were called " the settling of the Irishry", so in the mouths of their successois, "liberality" and "progress" mean irreligious and unnational education. But we are not to be gulled, and we will not be bullied Our own Irish morals suffice for us. We want neither the theoretic sentimentality nor the practical paganism of England. We reject the fatalist's abject creed—Ave refuse to glory in the name of Briton. Another line of policy must soon be tried, and he best will know the cunning of statecraft who hastens to supply the remedy. Has Young Ireland fallen? Behold how New Ireland rises in majesty and beauty, and now has grasped the flaming torch, and will bear it aloft to a glorious futurity. No corruption can de¬ ceive, no menaces can daunt, no tortures can subdue thee— dauntless, long-suffering Prometheus. But let Him take heed, the New One, who sits in the seat of the elder gods. Ancient Themis, changeless Justice, hath breathed her mission to thy secret ear. So let the rolling thunders roar, and the lightnings rift the shuddering rock. Thou canst not die, immortal cham¬ pion—and this the baffled Thunderer knows. Thou hast the secret of his reign. What, then, though he fetter thee! Is it not written that, from out the sunset, young Hercules will come to free the victim of his tyrant sire? The key of the situation is in our hands, and on the reconciliation of the Irish race de¬ pends the future of the empire. We are five millions within the seas, and twelve millions beyond the seas. The Irish vote in the Great Republic alone numbers ten hundred thousand men, and hundreds of thousands are there beside who as yet wield not the American franchise. The hewers of wood and the drawers of water are rapidly assuming the character and proportions of a people, prosjjerous, intelligent, and powerful, as becomes those whose hands are hardened by 3</page><page sequence="36">34 honest toil, and whose brows are furrowed by a mighty purpose. The very powers of nature are working in our favour. Little England cannot extend her narrow bounds. Her colonies can¬ not be counted on for the enforcement of domestic despotism— at any rate they are half our own. But it is no extravagant notion to suppose, and I am confirmed in my views by the testimony of American writers, that before a quarter of a cen¬ tury will have elapsed, the empire cities of the Atlantic sea¬ board, the broad plains of the middle and western states, where no Malthusian cautions, no laws of diminishing production yet obtain, will be teeming with an Irish population equal in wealth and numbers to the millions of England. The revolution is abroad and the revolution is at home, and, long before our hairs are gray, a political necessity will have forced on English statesmen the expediency of initiating a course of conciliation towards Ireland. In truth, it were not well to wait the returning Heracleidas. I know there are those who will dispute these anticipations. I know there are men of small science and of scant morality with whom the worship of accomplished facts has developed into a debasing fetichism, and who swear by the Genius of England, as Prastorians, and Publicans, and Proconsuls swore by the Genius of ancient Rome. But let them take heed. For as ancient Rome has fallen, so may imperial England fall, unless her states¬ men, with a sagacity which they have sometimes shown, cleanse the Augean stables of the state, and adapt their administration to the purer morality of our time. There was a voice that breathed in fearful whispers in the homes of starving tradesmen, and the huts of an oppressed and plundered peasantry. It rose above the din of revelry in courtly mansions. It spoke in lord¬ lier tones and with a more commanding majesty in the halls of the National Assembly. It rolled in reverberating thunder over a hundred fields of battle. To the music of the Marseillaise, with the war-cry of the Republic, the untaught valour of the enfranchised masses broke the pipe-clayed ranks of despotic Europe, and from the cannon's mouth and the levelled musket flashed forth freedom to the world. History often repeats itself. The tide of empire is setting westward. And the erratic New</page><page sequence="37">35 Zealander may anticipate his time allotted, and all too soon fulfil his artistic destiny, amid the ruins of the greatest of earthly cities, sketching the broken columns of one of earth's proudest temples. XIX. But, to postpone such political considerations, it remains that it is the judgment of the highest Catholic minds, the great Catho¬ lic publicists and the great Catholic theologians, that, on all the points on which Christianity comes into collision with nationalism, nominal Protestants are not to be trusted with, and conscientious Protestants are incapable of, the education of Catholic youth. This is as old as Bellarmine and Bossuet. And, if the whole earth is beginning to perceive it now, the only wonder is that the discovery should have been so long delayed. For Protes¬ tantism, shallow in its conception, suicidal in its development, could only preserve a specious appearance of vitality so long as observation was withdrawn from its fundamental character. The first moment that criticism was applied, and preeminently infidel criticism, with its triumphant sneer, which carries such strangely strong conviction, the inability of Protestantism to bear any but the most superficial examination was at once ex¬ emplified. The ceaseless commotion and ceaseless transforma¬ tion pervading its huge frame, could be no longer mistaken for the healthy exertion of vigorous life, but undisguisedly appalled the offended senses with the sights and smells of matter hasten¬ ing to dissolution. It were long to tell how this came about. It were long to relate the successive steps of that secular in¬ vestigation which has exposed the baselessness of the great Pro¬ testant revolt. All the world now knows the means by which Protestantism built up its arrogant dominion—the violence—the pretension—the chicane—the furious invectives against every ordinance and usage which was not the apotheosis of passion and animal instinct—the insidious appeals to throw off the yoke of all authority, with an ever-present afterthought to the substi¬ tution of its own—the suggestive art with which it invited men to the free exercise of their private judgment, with the studied inuendo that the resolve to abide by Catholic doctrine was not,</page><page sequence="38">36 however, an exercise of judgment in as true a sense as the re¬ solve to abandon it—the reckless sycophancy with which it whispered to every narrow forehead of them all, that his rude and darkened intellect was competent to appreciate not merely the great fact of the Church's mission, but the nice distinctions and connections of every word, sentence, verse, chapter, and book of those wondrous Writings, before the difficulties of whose interpretation the difficulties of all other books and libraries are nothing—the accommodating tenderness with which it could make allowance for every frailty and for every crime on the part of its supporters—the politic evasion of a radical danger, with which it laboured to compact the jarring contradictions of its heterogeneous progeny by the strong bond of a common hatred, and, in default of any holier principle of union, inculcated on Oalvinist the love of Lutheran for the sake of their mutual non- Catholicism. All the world knows these things now. And all the world now rejects that conception of Christianity which de¬ fines it, in the true spirit and practice of Protestant theology, through all the sects from Oxford to Geneva, as the unlimited and illimitable capacity for the simultaneous belief of direct con¬ tradictions. Above a certain level, men begin to question the necessary truth of a religion that avows its fallibility, and illus¬ trates its avowal by perpetual variation, and it may be doubted whether even the most crotchety of logicians will much longer continue to make Protestantism the sole exception in the sphere of thought to the operation of the Lex exclusi medii. But this salutary recognition of the errors of an effete heresy is not sufficient for the well-being of the Christian commonwealth. Care must be taken that the exploded fallacy be not consi¬ dered as the representative of Christianity in the eyes of those who have just come from detecting its unsoundness. And this, the present, danger can only be averted by all Catholic Chris¬ tians decisively assuming the position which belongs to them as the faithful and resolute members of that One Church, whose founder was the Man-God, whose first bishop was the Rock, and whose present is Pius IX. We live in an era of transition. The minds of men are active as they have not been for three weary centuries. The regeneration of the nations and the en-</page><page sequence="39">franchisement of the religious intellect are proceeding together. If the greatest benefit is to be reaped from these favourable dispo¬ sitions, it must be by completely and scientifically answering that interrogative, which sounds so imperiously from the proud lips of the confident philosopher, so plaintively from the wearied seeker disheartened by many a mirage: Give us a reason for your faith. Christianity is a science. To cast an untrained mind upon the complex mass of religious facts and religious speculation, and to tell it in the spirit of the most primitive and most unphilo- sophical empiricism, " select for yourself", " assume that obser¬ vation has done nothing before you, that system and science may be safely disregarded", is to affirm the inutility of all regu¬ lated research, to nullify all previous investigation, and, for that mind, whatever special skill it may possess in special subjects, to reduce the search for moral and religious truth to hap-hazard gropings in unknown paths, on which the chance combinations of surrounding social accidents shed by times a coloured light which too often only flashes to delude. The want of religious education is emphatically the want of the age. Therefore are the vulgar minds inevitably abandoned to all the frauds and all the delusions of some Joseph Smith, an inspired polygamist, of some Giles Jowls, an illuminated cobbler. Therefore does the roll of richest intellects present that sad exemplar of the knowledge that puffeth up, in the Rationalism of Strauss and Renan, the Positivism of Comte and Littre, the Anthropomorphism of Fichte, the Atheism of Feuerbach, and all the other distract¬ ing Isms which have never ceased to be significant of error. No wonder that, amid the contending din of suicidal specu¬ lations, the minds of men are fearfully perverted to accept the wildest theories of a revolting and uncompromising socialism, or to hopelessly abandon them to the blind regrets and aspira¬ tions of an unsatisfied scepticism, vainly seeking for the better things which no mere material progress can supply. The heavens have too long been darkened against us. From shore to shore wo hear the longings of a deep unrest. " The world is too much with us, late and soon, Getting and spending, we lny waste our powers; Little we see in Nature that is ours :</page><page sequence="40">38 We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon Tins sea that bares her bosom to the moon ; The winds that will be howling at all hours, And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers j For this, for everything, we are out of tune 5 It moves us not,—Great God! I 'd rather be A pagan, suckled in a creed out-worn, So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn, Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea, Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn", XX. In the teeth of Positivism, the Church hath always held and will always hold that the moral and religious nature of man is subject to no law of variation, is dependent on no canon of development, but continues through all ages bounded by the same limitations and determined to the same duties. The intel¬ lectual nature of man, it is true, varies with every condition of the race. The civilization of the Semitic is not thatt of the Aryan nations. The genius of the subtle Greek was not the genius of the broad-browed Teuton. The speculations of the Vedanta show other grooves of thought than the Novum Organum or the Essay on Human Understanding. And still we tread the path of change, and call it the path of progress. And still we thirst for knowledge, and seeking are not satisfied. But, though the forms of civilization be the creatures of custom, or climate, or acoident, the truths of religion and morality are adapted to all conditions of the race and the individual; Hindoo, and Moor, and Latin, and Gael can worship at the same altars and acknowledge the same moral obligations; and, it is mere impious rant, and more than senile folly, to talk of subjecting these universal and immutable principles to the fancied requirements of material progress or the presumptuous empiricism of an incomplete physical science. Rather should we accord to these immutable principles—the only stable elements amid the shifting universe of things—a position above and beyond all others. Such a view, and such only, is correct. Adopt any other theory. With the disciples of Bentham, resolve the good into the expedient, and conscience into causation. Call your system</page><page sequence="41">39 Deontology. Call it Ethology. It at least is not Mora¬ lity. Therefore hath the Catholic Church always held, and must always hold, that since religion and morality are not the creatures of human institutions, they shall not be subordinated to human law or made subservient to human policy. And therefore does she now declare, as she always hath declared, that in all doc¬ trinal and moral questions, the authority of the Church is neces¬ sarily superior to that of the State, that she alone has the right to determine where political expediency trenches on the domain of spiritual interests; and, since it is no more her office to sow the faith among the nations than to preserve it when impaited, that to her, and to her alone, belongs the supreme jurisdiction and final arbitrement in all matters relating to instruction and educa¬ tion. Such are and have ever been the principles and practice of the Catholic Church. To conceive them susceptible of alteration would involve not merely an error of prejudice, but a fundamental misconception of the nature of Catholic dogma. To those who hold such language or who dare cherish such a presumptuous hope, I would address myself and be understood to ask: Is this all that history has taught them of that inexorable and uncompromising Church of Rome? Have they yet to learn that change is an unknown word in the annals of that shiftless Church And, do they yet expect, with some show of confidence, that the condemned propositions of the Encyclical yet will be recalled, that the Queen's Colleges yet will be included in the annual benediction Urbi et Orbi, and be, perchance, adorned by some grateful Pontiff with the style and title of Bulwarks of the Faith I am sorry that I must dispel these pleasing anticipations— these consolatory illusions. The Catholic Church cannot, from the nature of her institution, alter, rescind, or revoke one authoritative utterance. The reasons which once have led to the definition and sanctioned promulgation of a dogma must, from the nature of truth, also cause it to obtain, with its original binding force, through all time to come. The Catholic Church offers no concessions to " the spirit of the age". She makes no compromise with any number of " philosophical conclusions".</page><page sequence="42">40 The divine non possumus is her only answer to the solicitations of hollow friends and the threats of open enemies. And before that she abandons her sacred conservativism, she is prepared to encounter every danger and suffer every trial with her supreme visible head upon earth, the King-Bishop of Rome. For faith is one, and morality i3 one, and the same moral and doctrinal teachings, which won the wisest of the ancients, and tamed the warriors of Clovis, must for ever continue to rule the hearts and understandings of men, unmoved and uninfluenced by the giddy whirl of merely material speculation. xxr. The Red Revolution, the latest offspring, or rather the closing scene and final development, of the Lutheran revolt, is the enemy with which the Church has now to deal. It rages idly around her eternal foundations, and the hoarse roar of its baffled anger may appal the timid, but cannot daunt the brave. Is Christian feeling extinguished? Is the Papacy on the verge of dissolution? Let the dreamers wait awhile. The end is not yet. The milk-white hind again doomed to death is fated not to die. Infidelity is not now so rife as in the last years of the eighteenth century. Democracy is learning to recognize in Christianity a guide and friend, and to adapt its requirements to the kindred institutions of the Christian Commonwealth. Catholic feeling is more intense. Catholic influence is more powerful. In all respects we are stronger, more united than in that disastrous time. We rose then; so shall we rise again. Soon from land to land shall beacon the signals of a mightier reaction, and our rebound shall be the greater in proportion to the rudeness of our trial. Three times already have the Pontiff Kings remodelled the frame of European society. Through them the Roman world bowed before the Crucified, and the exalted cross became the symbol of Roman civilization and the pledge of imperial vic¬ tory. And when the crash came, and the stately fabric of the Roman Empire fell beneath the torrent of the barbarians, whose outstretched hands and commanding aspect won mercy for the vanquished from the awed invaders, and saved the terrified pro-</page><page sequence="43">41 vincials half the shock of that tremendous revolution? In pro¬ moting the fusion of the Latin and Gothic races—in subduing the untutored victors to the practices of Catholic religion and the forms of Roman civilization—and, finally, by a wise resus¬ citation of the ancient empire, which consecrated the principle of authority in the person of Charlemagne to be a symbol of union and a type for imitation to the nascent peoples—the Popes facilitated the progress of the nations, and fitted them to endure the tempests of an era of transition. Nor do we less owe to the Popes the origination of those principles and institutions which, taking their rise in the middle ages, still constitute the fundamental elements of modern society. The natural equality of the human family, obscured by long ages of Roman and barbarian oppression, first found itself vindicated in the prin¬ ciples and practice of a republican church, which bestowed its highest dignities as impartially on the son of trader or me¬ chanic, as on him in whose veins ran the blood of Pepin, and all the Ceesars of the Carlovingian throne. The mo¬ nastic orders had set the example to the ancient world of labour by the hands of freemen; and the principle of personal dignity had its further development and final consecration in the emancipation of the serfs on the ecclesiastical domains. The chastity of the Christian virgin, the sanctity of the marriage tie, were the constant objects of a paternal solicitude which never relaxed its tender sternness until it had impressed the sentiment of woman's honour on the public conscience of Europe, and for ever averted the degradation of the harem. The Truce of God gave a sanctioned protection to the harvest of the husbandman and the traffic of the burgher. The establishment of numerous schools, colleges, and universities provided for the diffusion and cultivation of learning, and formed rallying points for future progress. When the fifteenth century closed, the long labours of the Popes were beginning to give promise of abundant fruit. The world was starting forward on an unexampled career of mental and material prosperity. The discovery of a new continent gave an outlet to adventure, and offered an incentive to research. A new and larger love for literature and science was fascinating the keenest spirits of the age. Christendom</page><page sequence="44">42 seemed about to enjoy the full benefits of repose with the blessings of activity. The Lutheran revolt broke up the commonwealth of nations. It broke the unity of European civilization; it introduced dis¬ cord into the bosom of that civilization, and weakened the physical and moral action which it exercised on the rest of the world. Why, for the past three hundred years has so little been effected towards the conversion and civilizing of the un¬ believer and the savage? Why does Asia sit in darkness? Why is the Maori hunted to the Red Indian's grave Because for the past three hundred years Protestantism has robbed Europe of her destiny. Without the fatal event of the six¬ teenth century, the condition of the world would now be very different from what it is. Thenceforth the largest part of our intellectual, moral, and physical powers were condemned to be employed and sadly wasted in a struggle which armed brethren against brethren. The voice of nature was too weak amid the carnival of furious passions, to whom the cloak of religion was but the convenient mantle of the bravo. The same century which saw the Apostate Monk play pander to the Hessian Landgrave, and Calvin gloating over charred Servetus, saw the revival of a more abominable slave trade—saw the massacres of Elizabeth—saw the massacres of Medici. But why multiply instances To every thinking man it is evident that Europe is not what she would have been without the appearance of Pro¬ testantism ; and certainly it is not less evident that the results of her civilizing influence on the world have not answered the promises of the early years of the sixteenth century. For three hundred years the Papacy, the embodiment of legitimate authority, has been assailed by Protestantism, the embodiment of anarchical revolt. For three hundred years the Christian Church has had to defend herself against the Parthian tactics of an ever-shifting foe. The death struggle has now begun, and some think the opponents are not unfairly matched. Let the dreamers wait a while. The Red Revolution now leads on its forces for conclusive contest with resolute Rome, and, true to its native policy of disruption, seeks to sever the ancient union between Christian morality and national prosperity, and</page><page sequence="45">43 by a dishonest juggle cast discredit on the grand old Christian political maxim: Quod est ad Dei gloriam est ad bonum com¬ muned But let the fiend look up and know his mounted scale aloft. " For the Vicars of Jesus Christ have only begun their toil in guiding the Christian order of Europe, as the centre of a vaster commonwealth of nations, which shall hereafter touch upon the sunrise and the sunset". XXII. An insensate patriotism, in some countries, yet clings to the fallacy of insulated churches. Said an accomplished English¬ man in a popular work: " It is the anti-national character of the Romish system which mainly revolts Englishmen; and, if their sense of this should ever grow weak, their protest against that system would soon lose nearly all of its energy and strength". In this explicit avowal of Dr. Trench we read the certain assur¬ ance, that Protestantism, like Protectionism, is doomed to disap¬ pear before the every day increasing comprehension of the true nature and conditions of national and international welfare. The sovereign power in each state is supreme and without appeal within its own limits, moral and constitutional Be it so. But beyond these limits it finds itself controlled by a higher power, by international law. This is not a theory, but a fact of universal history. Wherever a state-system exists—and it must exist ex¬ cept in the single case of universal empire—the establishment of the Church must be very imperfect, if it is only set side by side with the civil power within each state, and not also set side by side with the external all-controlling power. It is not enough that national law admit the Church as an element in the state, unless international law admit it as an element in the state-system. It is not enough that the Christian Church should be distinctive and national. It must also be Catholic and international. Not to any particular race or people does its mission speak, but by its fundamental character and divine charter of incorporation hath it been instituted to teach all nations. To it the distinctions of national and anti-national are foreign and non significant, or rather in its view are all nations only one. It is conterminous alone with Christian morality, which is the breath of the life of</page><page sequence="46">44 Christian civilization. It is the organ of that universal morality. And, binding as the Divine law by which it speaks, its sen¬ tences are addressed to all men, as well corporate bodies as in¬ dividuals within the Christian commonwealth. Such is the only ideal which at all corresponds with the high position and uni¬ versal operation of Christian religion and morality. Such is not the Protestant ideal. Such is the theory on which the " Romish System" proceeds. And in no question docs that Christian Church, Catholic and Roman, more decisively interfere than in the question of Education. For no other question is so radically, intimately, eternally, bound up with the most solemn interests of morality and the enduring welfare of nations and in¬ dividuals. XXIII. At this stage recapitulating, according to the method of affir¬ mation, the phases of the subject which have been discussed, and entirely rejecting the great conservative principle—Whatever is, therefore ought to be—we may arrange our conclusions with regard to the ideas involved in Public Education, as follows: 1. Education should be permissively Professional. So long as professions are generally adopted, and due facilities for such adoption generally afforded, it cannot be a matter of much im¬ portance, politically speaking, what profession may be followed in any particular instance; and, there would be small reason to anticipate a benefit from the interference of authority with the healthy principles of private interest and free competition. 2. Education should be adequately Literary. Such know¬ ledge is highly conducive to the general refinement and general well-being of the community. And a measure which would offer stronger immediate inducement to professional students to be conversant with at least the rudiments of scholarship, would, I opine, be no small improvement on the mass of educational spe¬ culations now on their trial 3. Education should be compulsorily Political. The diffu¬ sion of political knowledge is the primary ground of public in¬ terference in matters of education. For, where political education has been provided, there can be small danger of an absolute</page><page sequence="47">45 monarch misusing his authority, while, where such education has been culpably neglected or criminally suppressed, a quasi- representative government may be all the more pernicious to the commonweal, so far forth as it clothes itself with the pretence of popular sanction, and masks the promptings of class interest under the guise of public providence and benevolent authority. 4. Education should be permissively Religious—at least so far as is not subversive of the general morality—certainly so far as is required by the community or the bulk of it. And, if to the right understanding of a Christian civilization, Christian education is a necessary condition, then does the establishment of such education become a matter of the first importance in a Christian state, and necessarily enters into the public and politi¬ cal education of that state. 5. Education must be National. This is the same as saying that the education of a country should be suited to that country rather than any other. If it were unsuited to the place of its application, it would be stupid to parade its suitability to some foreign and indifferent locality. Besides, in a particular sense, education must be national Ireland is a co equal and co-ordinate nation of the nations which makeup the great Anglo-Irish Em¬ pire. We are Irishmen. We are not West Britons. At least we will not be West Britons until the Britons become East Irish. And, it is not for us to be unmindful of the by-gone glories and the brightening future of our race. I have come from reading in the Revue des Deux Mondes, the demand which M. Ernest Renan makes for extended culture of the old Celtic tongues. " Why", asks he, " has not France her chairs of Celtic literature? In Germany there is not, I do not say a single university, but a single school of high standing, which has not its chair of ancient German language and litera¬ ture. Do the Celtic tongues possess fewer monuments of the past? Do they suggest critical problems less interesting and less varied? No, certainly. The written texts in the four Celtic dialects form a whole equal to the mass of ancient German texts; they ascend as high, and in point of historic and poetic in¬ terest, they aie superior. Alas! these national treasures are among us forgotten". In the protest and the self-reproach of the</page><page sequence="48">46 patriotic Frenchman, every Irishman must join. Why have we not chairs of Celtic literature Why is not the spoken language, still so universal in many parts of Ireland, lovingly preserved from the approaching doom with which the foreign tongue threatens it Where is the patriotic munificence of our wealthy Irishmen Better, morally, religiously, nationally, and intellectually, the en¬ dowment of one professorship of Celtic, than the renovation of ten superfluous cathedrals at one hundred and fifty thousand pounds a piece. I advocate no Utopian aim. Accomplished facts are stern realities. Besides, the conservation of tongues and dialects too often prevents men and nations from being reached by the influence of civilization, and from bearing their contingent to progress. There is this advantage in the use, however acquired, of a world-language. But, none the less, even on the lowest grounds of material expediency, must the extinction of a lan¬ guage like the Irish, glowing with the aspirations of patriotism, Avarm with the hues of poesy, venerable with the* hallowed re¬ collections of immemorial antiquity, be predicted with regret— with dangerous regret. The antiquary, the historian, the philolo¬ gist, may justly mourn over the lowly tomb that foreign hands are scooping for the eldest born of Europe's stately sisterhood. And with what kindling aspect shall Eire's soldier race endure the rude-enforced silence of that music which erewhile hushed the sorrows of their dark Rosaleen? Yet how easy it were to assure to the Irish tongue an honourable existence, perchance a glorious immortality! Within the memory of man, the Hungarian was a subject dialect, scornfully abandoned to the rude intercourse of boors. To-day, on the lips of a hundred noble orators, it wings the burning thoughts, that rush from the statesman-patriot's resolve and steel the courage of Hungary's listening chivalry. But the manhood of Ireland is emasculate. The pride of national existence is forgotten in the pampered degradation of the obsequious parasite. The old tongue is dying, dying—the old tongue which, like a great voice out of the past, meets us at the beginnings of history, and fraught with the memories of un¬ numbered centuries—Brennus and Dathi, Gergovia and Fon- tenoy,—now sees itself condemned to sink for ever in the un- distmguishing oblivion which foreign jealousy exultingly pre-</page><page sequence="49">47 pares for everything that might be to us a memorial of the past, or a suggestion for the future. Vce Victis. It hath been deter¬ mined. 6. Education must not be a government monopoly. It is not endurable that a government should, either in law or in fact, have a complete control over the education of the people. To possess such a control, and actually exert it, is to be despotic. 7. Education, at least in order to the diffusion of political knowledge, must be free, or gratuitous, to all. For what is to the general benefit, should be supported at the general expense, and not imposed as a particular burthen on a portion of the community. And I cannot but consider the setting a price upon the acquisition of political knowledge as a most pernicious tax, levied at the most inconvenient time, with the least possible advantage to the treasury, and imposed upon the persons who, least of all, should be exposed to such a peculiar burthen; being those who, from a public point of view, are favourably distin¬ guished from all others by their praiseworthy resolution to pre¬ pare themselves for their duties as citizens by making themselves acquainted with the science of citizenship. XXIV. Therefore, then, I would suggest, that perhaps the great desideratum of a complete and useful system of public education might be best attained in Ireland by the establishment of one National University, called the University of Ireland, and com¬ prehending under it the various denominational collegiate systems which the requirements of the governed might render imperative on the government to sanction, if not support, together with such especial colleges as might be found expedient for the accommodation of those whom personal, or paternal, distrust of some one particular religion had led by a common though incon¬ sequent induction to the choice of an educational institution from which all religion should be eliminated. For, most certainly and most emphatically, I am opposed to the multiplication of univer¬ sities. The reasons which make denominational schools and col¬ leges imperative to educate the immature intelligence of school boys and undergraduates, abate no small degree of their urgency</page><page sequence="50">48 in the case of matured and scientific scholars, since such, presu¬ mably, graduates must be. Religion being a main object kept steadily in view throughout the whole period of pre-graduate study, scientific excellence might fitly be the grand distinguishing aim of that single university on which should be dependent, and to which should tend, all the denominational collegiate systems of the country, as of inferior scientific station. The noble and con¬ soling theory of United Education, ever impracticable in its full extent, because only adapted to a much higher ideal of society than human nature can be reasonably expected to attain, and utterly condemnable in its present official perversion, would re¬ ceive the highest realization of which it is capable, within the austere halls of science, where the flower of Ireland's educated studenthood would contend, in the generous emulation of honour¬ able scholarship and the regulated enthusiasm of enlightened patriotism, in order to the advancement of philosophic truth, the well-being of their common country, and the best interests of universal humanity. We might then confidently hope that high bcience would incidentally confirm religious truth, and, if the test failed of this result, or was refused without trial, we might fairly doubt entirely the efficiency of denominational education. An assured and uniform standard -of science throughout the national colleges can be arrived at by no other arrangement; and I cannot but think, when the Catholic University, the Queen's University, and Trinity College, have been subordi¬ nated to the one central Unity, that many unpatriotic jealousies will have then been extinguished for ever, and that the best provision will have then been made, by the suppression of mis¬ chievous sinecures and by such other measures as the public wel¬ fare demands, for the just application of the unemployed or mis¬ used revenues of the state to the purposes of a complete and useful system of public education. The event will show whether any such efficient means of promoting the Oneness of Nationhood is at all within the intention of Ireland's quasi-benefactors. 1 UNlVEf-WTTV t I OFBRJSIOL ' I UWARY</page></plain_text>
