Paul Douglass Lecture PASSIVE VOICE THEORIES IN RELIGIOUS SOCIOLOGY MARY DOUGLAS Russell Sage Foundation Review of Religious Research, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Fall, 1979): 51-61 "Passive Voice Theories" include all sociological and psychological approaches which imply a passive human object influenced by imper- sonal forces. This paper argues that a sociology of religion which pur- ports to take account of human intentions and do justice to individual beliefs can develop an active voice theoretical approach. This would proceed by tracing the accountability systems which individuals develop when they make claims against each other, and which they reinforce by appeals to unseen powers or attributes of the personality. Account- ability systems rest on moral assumptions but can be investigated anthropologically by tested methods. They can provide a basis for objective comparison of beliefs between different cultures. A wide range of criticisms of sociology and psychology agree in protest- ing against mechanistic procedures and naive determinism. One form of complaint is that the theoretical apparatus treats the human agent as a passive arena in which impersonal forces are alleged to contend. The passivity attributed to the agent gives me my title and focuses a question I wish to address about the relations between language and theory. Some of these critics maintain that if terminology were to be changed, right thinking would follow. I do not agree that a switch into, the active voice in speaking about the human agent is enough; there still would have to be new theoretical approaches to match the new form of language. "Sociological determinism" stands for an attitude on the part of the sociologist. We can treat it as a kind of belief, not one necessarily adopted by the sociologist personally, but an attitude which is implicit in the terms in which the inquiry is set. It assumes, for the sake of inquiry, that some social forces external to the individual are acting upon him. The external agencies are active; the individual is a passive respondent. The sociologist's belief or attitude is itself like a passive response to a theoretical framework which requires it. By using this theoretical framework, the sociologist expects to carry out an important sociological enterprise. He intends to discover and measure the extent of social pressures upon belief. However, by one of the several paradoxes inherent to the case, he can- not use the theoretical framework to investigate his own professional atti- tude. The machinery of analysis has these blind spots. It cannot study the validity of religious beliefs in the way that it is designed to study the validity of beliefs that the weather will change. The methods of natural science seem to have this disadvantage in religious studies: they cannot say anything about subjective experience. This gives the sociology of re- ligion four famous disadvantages. It is intended for studying beliefs, yet</page><page sequence="2">52 beliefs are what it cannot study. It is intended toi be objective, yet the observer's bias belittles the status of the belief. It tries to study meaning, by a method that reduces meaning to behavioral response. And, it elimi- nates the subject as an active agent. The dignity of the human subject and of the beliefs espoused by him are both reduced to epiphenomenal disturbances of a normal state. The social causes of beliefs are just as crude a bludgeon as the physiological causes of states of mind. In either case, the autonomity of the subject and the validity of the subject's state- ments is irrelevantly impugned by a whole system of causation: "You don't really mean it, your indigestion makes you irritable;" "It is not sur- prising that you should subscribe to the Episcopal church, given your up- ward social mobility." Believers can certainly try to shrug off the insult, with a tu quoque, "You only belittle the active human subject and distort beliefs because you are talking sociology." But mud-slinging will not save the sociology of religion. Too many serious thinkers worried by these well-known problems have given up the socio- logical enterprise altogether and turned to a literary mode for thinking more profoundly on the human estate. The result has been a shift of sociology as a rigorous explanatory discipline into a richly evocative literary mode, full of insight and beauty. However, the new mode completely shirks the initial project of discovering and estimating the power of social pressures upon individual belief. A century of sociological endeavor is rolled back and, instead of analysis, we are offered essays that are as absorbing and elegant as excerpts might be from War and Peace, The Brothers Karamazov, even Pride and Prejudice in modern dress. The old sociological questions about belief lie rustily on the shelf. PROPOSAL If we are to stay with the original important problems-assessing social factors in belief-we need to change our theoretical stance and our lan- guage as well. The problem is not confined to the sociology of religion. Social psychology and the sociology of knowledge both study social factors in belief and both are without a strong theoretical approach. An agnostic or deterministic view does not undermine their work so drastically. They can honorably chip away at part-problems. But the trouble is much more acute for the sociology of religion than for any other branch of inquiry because it loses all its claims to serious scholarship unless it can surmount the several difficulties simultaneously. Nor can religious studies be greatly helped by those who believe that careful attention to an active voice terminology will be enough to turn the direction of thought towards taking into account the autonomous human agent in the analysis. This belief, that language is strongly determinant of thought, addresses our problems in what can be called the passive voice. It is almost a parable for this essay. It assumes, implicitly, that to correct the language will correct the thinking: the thinker is reduced to a passive element to whom linguistic things happen. It is another exemplification of the error we are examining. The hidden assumption is that the speaker does not</page><page sequence="3">53 exert an independent control over his thought; it is channelled and directed by the structure of his language. Only one step removed from cultural determinism, speech determinism is an uncomfortable assumption with which to attack mechanistic, deterministic thinking in the social sciences. I would like to take Roy Schafer's challenging book The New Language of Psychoanalysis (1976) as a model for this discussion. Schafer is fully apprised of these problems and has expressed them very forcefully. How- ever, his own solution is to change the vocabulary. He maintains that if the form of words gives live agents the credit for their own actions, clearer thinking and better theorizing will result. Most of his examples of the use of the passive voice come from the psychoanalyst in the clinical context, when the patient is given a mechanistic model of the self struggling with extraneous forces. The analyst will say mildly: "You broke through the internal barriers against your feelings of love." Since Schafer does not believe in internal barriers, the new action language that he advocates would say instead: "You finally did not refrain from acting lovingly," thus pinning on the patient the full responsibility for his own emotions. Using passive voice language the analyst will say: "Your chronic deep sense of worthlessness comes from the condemning voice of your mother." But Schafer does not believe that the voice of the mother is really there. Action language would translate: "You regularly imagine your mother's voice condemning you, and you, agreeing with it, regard yourself as being essen- tially worthless." Passive analytic language says: "You are afraid of your impulse to throw caution to the winds." Schafer does not believe in im- pulses as entities to be afraid of any more than he believes in barriers, so his action language retranslates. Shafer expects careful adherence to action language will pin responsi- bility where it belongs. It recognizes the human agency of will and pur- pose. It would accurately convey psychoanalytic thinking instead of con- doning or colluding with the patient's wish to deny his own intentions. For example: If one looks at the idea of 'slip of the tongue' from the standpoint of dis- claimed action, one notices several facts immediately: First, it is being maintained through circumlocution that it is the tongue, not the person, who (that) has slipped-as if the tongue regulates its own activity. Second, it is being maintained that what has happened is an accident-a slip-and not a meaningful extended action. . . . In psychoanalytic practice we do not accept these disclaimers. We do not believe that there has been an accident." (Schafer, 1976:130) The slip is not a disrupted action, but a special kind of action in which two courses are taken simultaneously, corresponding to ambivalence in the speaker. Once action language is fully adopted, a range of picturesque metaphors will be dropped, because they misleadingly allow the speaker to split ele- ments off from himself, to endow them with initiative and energy, and thus to disclaim his own responsibility. Anger can no longer be treated as a sub- stance-liquid when it spills over, solid when it crushes or penetrates the consciousness, or gaseous when the challenge is to keep the lid on it (Schafer, 1976:281).</page><page sequence="4">54 To love and act lovingly are the proper focus for rendering the idea of love in action language. Having thereby lost its status as an entity in this lan- guage, love can no longer make the world go round; it can no longer glow, grow, or wither; and it can no longer be lost or found, cherished, poisoned or destroyed . . . it is we who glow, love more or love less, love at all or stop loving." (Schafer, 1976:279) The reason for radical criticism of the current language in psycho- analysis is that physical science deals with forces, causes, determinants and effects. It cannot deal with meaning and with subjects entertaining mean- ings. The analysis of the human psyche needs to focus on situations, mean- ings, actions and reasons. These four terms co-define each other. No situation can be envisaged unless it is interpreted as such or given meaning; nor can it arise unless human actions have created it; nor can the human actions be explained except by the interpretation of situations which gen- erate reasons for acting. This same foursome which Schafer proposes to put in place of mecha- nistic causes and forces in psychology will do well for the equivalent switch in terminology in the sociology of religion. But Schafer allows himself to rest there, whereas sociology must go on. Schafer has only the limited aim of reconciling clinical practice with high psychoanalytic theory, proposing the same language for each. Benefits surely would flow automatically from any such reconceptualizing exercise. But there must be real concep- tualizing, not mere vocabulary change. Schafer thinks that if we change the sentences from the passive to the active voice, a new theoretical scheme will emerge. But this is surely a mistake. First, he only proposes to change the clinical practice of speaking as if to a passive patient. This will do nothing to change the high theory of which he is mainly critical. It also will create awkwardness and counter-productive strain in the clinical situ- ation. For the passive voice corresponds to a particular social intention. Sociologists who use mechanistic theories and passive voice language in respect of individual beliefs also have an explicit intention set by their theories. The psychoanalyst in his clinic has a social situation to deal with, which would get out of hand if he were to use active voice language for explaining to the hypersensitive patient the full extent of his own responsi- bility. An active voice theory of the relation of words to thought would take systematic account of the intentions of speakers who have chosen to use the passive voice to describe their own thinking. To, hear Schafer sub- scribing to a passive voice theory of language convinces one that thinking the problem through requires more theoretical energy, more questioning and rethinking of the basis of the study than he is prepared to give at this stage. ANALYSIS I will illustrate further the contrast between passive and active voice theories by drawing an impressionistic contrast between Muller's (1873) theory of the disease of language and Whorf's (1956) theory of the re- strictions placed by language on thought.</page><page sequence="5">55 Muller vs. Whorf Muller, the great philogist, has become an antique curiosity in the history of religion. His theory about how some peculiar religious beliefs originated is relevant here. Muller never doubted the human power to reach spiritual heights of imagination or to conceive abstract ideas. He was prepared to credit humans with such powers. Insofar as the gods of classical antiquity were alleged to behave with justice and decorum, he felt no need to explain religious beliefs by any pathological tendency. But to explain stories about their more idiosyncratic and lusty feats, he developed his theory of mythology deriving from a disease of language. This disease he attributed to a universal human weakness, inability to retain an abstract idea as first conceived: a work once devised to carry a complex meaning would soon fall away from abstraction and spirituality and be used only to convey a crass, particular, material sense. This disease of language would always be leaving daily speech cluttered with great words demeaned. Empty of their original connotation, a host of hybrid anthropomorphic agencies poses puzzles for worthy lexi- cographers whose trade drives them to invent stories about them. In this way, the odder parts of Greek and Roman mythology would be seen as later additions to purely intellectual and moral philosophy. The disease of language theory was dismissed for many reasons. Surpris- ingly, in the wider modern context, it was held utterly implausible. Yet other linguists who have proposed equally unconvincing theories about the relation of thought to language have been taken very seriously. Whorf speculated that syntactic structures would tend to limit the possibilities of thought. He pre- sented thought as a kind of moving flow of traffic through the structures of language, channeled and restricted by the latter. The implication is that for each kind of language, only certain ways of thinking are possible. In Whorf's view, thought is limited by language. In Muller's view, thought is limited by itself; language can say anything that humans want to say but, unfortunately, their wants change. They do not always need the more diffi- cult concepts for which they have developed words. This seems to, have some long-run plausibility. Contrasted with Whorf, we can place Muller on the side of those who take meanings as prior and speech constraints as secondary. He did not see language itself as a barrier or constraint to thought and held failures in thinking responsible for a process by which abstract theogonies degenerate into mechanistic, material models. Psyche becomes a seductive girl; Zeus a lecher in comic opera disguises. Going beyond more speculative generalizations, Muller actually proposed his rule as a tendency in language. He can be credited with a theory of downward semantic drift. In like fashion, sociologists who meant to investigate the intellectual and emotional life of human beings have drifted away from their intentions. They talk about human agencies, meanings, and actions. They have not let their grammar lead their thought, but their thought has left their wider intentions stranded, doing justice only to their natural science assumptions and methodology. The use of natural science methodology and its terms have produced rich insights into religious sociology. But our failure to hold to the original complexities of the enterprise have left us with extraordinary entities in our dictionary, belittling of the believers and the beliefs which</page><page sequence="6">56 we would like to understand. We now have to cope with causes (such as relative deprivation, or upward social mobility) and effects (such as routiniza- tion and secularization). At the same time, there is no reason to suppose that we cannot throw out the distracting elements of our language and start with a new effort of will to reinstate Zeus and Psyche in their full majesty. To justify Muller's idea further, we can easily find words which reify strange mechanical forces credited with anthropomorphic intentions. When we view these carefully, we recognize that the words are not doing some- thing to our thoughts; our intentions have weakened and narrowed, our thinking has lost its sharp edge. We have fallen into inertia and exemplify the disease of language. Ordinary speech attributes to other entities the agency which belongs to ourselves. In everyday locutions, we attribute spatial properties to the mind: "It went clean out of my mind"; "Murder entered my mind"; "Suicide was at the back of my mind." These are examples given by Schafer. Recall also the legal formula which speaks of the mind as a machine with a definite equilibrium: "While the balance of his mind was disturbed." Then some- times we refer to the mind as an autonomous agent: "My mind plays tricks on me"; "I wish I knew my own mind"; "I am in twoi minds." These phrases do not mislead the listener. They are couched deliberately as disclaimers of responsibility in which the speaker's goodwill is guaranteed, and guaranteed all the more because, by implication, what the mind will do is left in doubt and outside the speaker's control (Schafer, 1976:132). There is nothing irrational about such disclaimers: "A mad impulse seized me"; "The words poured out of my mouth." Everyday speech has good reasons for interposing another agent between the speaker and his own actions. It is more courteous to say: "It must have escaped your memory" than to suppress the "it" and simply accuse: "You forgot me." Some care for the feelings of others justifies these polite disclaimers. This sensitivity to our own everyday use of the passive voice gives a clue to the approach in the sociology of religion which I wish to propose. Many of the religions of the world have doctrines of multiple personality according to which the individual is divided between several more or less coordinated persons. These constituent persons of the person tend to have different inten- tions and capacities attributed to them. A person who has incurred blame is allowed to feel its force, softened by knowing that the action of which he was guilty can be attributed to one but not to all of his own constituent personalities. This time, the polite disclaimer comes from others in an ordi- nary context, instead of from the psychoanalyst speaking to the patient. The human subject almost disappears from sight, among a throng of other active spirits who are judging, willing, accepting, or rejecting on his behalf; the subject, indeed, in many religious doctrines becomes an object, a passive arena where bizarre forces contend. But we should not interpret this multipli- cation of personalities as a mistake, a form of inertia, or another case of the disease of language. If we take it as our principal assumption that noth- ing is done by mistake, that the subjects are in control of their own thoughts and their own language and have adapted the language to their thoughts, we can reach a better understanding of their stated beliefs.</page><page sequence="7">57 Phenomenology The active voice language is appropriate for a phenomenological theory. As sociologists, we have engaged on an investigation. We are determined that it be an investigation of religious behavior which, fully sociological in its intentions, still insists upon recognizing the active independent agency of the people we are studying. Once, when I described these assumptions as nec- essary, a student asked whether they achieved any better analysis, or whether they merely made me feel good. The claim is precisely that the analysis is improved. At this point, I introduce the concept of the accountability system. As a concept, it owes much to the ethnomethodologists. As a method, it was developed by anthropologists for the comparison of moral principles. The method consists in setting people's beliefs back into the social context of their lives, by careful, intensive field research. With this method, no alleged belief in strange invisible entities is allowed to qualify as a belief until there is evidence that it is acted upon in some socially intelligible way. The moral judgments are supposed not to exist merely as noble sentiments; the interest lies in the way they are daily invoked as means of holding other people to their promises, enforcing contracts, extracting lenient remissions and so on. By systematic research into every kind of confrontation, the general prin- ciples by which people hold each other accountable can be laid bare. Ac- countability systems vary. The moral principles they invoke differ and the institutions into, which they are incorporated differ to that extent. By fasten- ing on moral principles and their use in building systems of accountability, the sociologist has a way of giving value to individuals' free negotiating activities. At the same time, from the limited but firm standpoint of a com- mon cognitive enterprise, we can reckon what are the kinds of social institu- tions that are built upon different outcomes of moral judgment. Each accountability system, to be sufficiently coherent to function, has to create explanations, and attribute qualities such as vengefulness, caprice, or kindness to invisible powers. Each accountability system is likely to call upon the malice of ghosts or on a High God's justice, or use other devices to make its sterner judgments acceptable. In modern industrial culture, we have developed a complex typology of personalities and talents to justify our procedures of exclusion or promotion. "High IQ" is a concept that responds to our need to measure and scale criteria of admission. If we could agree a measure of mental stability, it would enter the repertoire of per- sonality attributes. Sometimes the full responsibility is nailed to the culprit; sometimes the theory of causation will mitigate responsibility so that the offense which is being judged is softened into something that either might happen to anyone or the person could have committed unknowingly-" For the sake of living together in peace, each society will combine the active voice and the passive voice in different measures, tol make harsh judgments acceptable to unfortunate persons who ask why disasters have befallen them. Accountability systems vary, of course, in their internal consistency and completeness and in many other ways that reflect their use within social institutions.</page><page sequence="8">58 The first elaborate examples of this method were Evans-Pritchard's (1937) analyses of Azande and Nuer moral and political systems. H-aimen- dorf's comparison of Hindus and Buddhists in Nepal is another valuable exercise. The essence of the method is to trace beliefs in divine attributes to the moral values which are institutionalized and actionable. These be- liefs are part and parcel of the social life, fully credible within it, sub- scribed to whenever a person in such a society wishes either to exercise his rights or to charge another with default. At that point, when insisting on moral claims, individuals declare their autonomy within society and reveal their own constructive efforts to maintain or change the local world view. Their active agency is a necessary starting point for the analysis. Moreover, the old sociological perspective is still in view. African Beliefs Let me describe a comparison of two belief systems which could be submitted to the old style analysis of sociological determinism. The cul- tures of the West Coast of Africa have variant forms of a belief in multiple personalities. The thinking, willing, acting parts of an individual are split off from each other in various ways, culturally standardized in each case. One such set of beliefs has been described brilliantly by Fo~rtes (1959) writing about the Tallensi in the Volta region of Ghana. Their cult of the ancestors and their belief in Destiny combine to, give them explanations of misfortune which are much more than pure intellectual speculations. They channel the Tallensi ideas of moral responsibility and set them to work in the social context so efficiently that action, institutions, and beliefs are parts of one process. Fortes takes the Tallensi beliefs in their com- posite personality as. seriously as they do. He shows how their concept of the good person is inculcated through early training, and how it integrates the individual into the patrilineal lineage structure of their society, at the same time as finely adjusting the pattern of rewards and punishments (which the dead ancestors administer) to their moral ideas and to, the social structure. Over and above, the relation of the live individual to, the justice and vigilance of his ancestors, the Tallensi have to reckon with a part of the personality which existed before they were born-their indi- vidual Destiny-which is thought to, have accepted or rejected the moral requirements. If the Destiny is a bad one, then they will (not consciously) tend to behave in deviant ways, lacking in respect for their kinsmen, and so bringing down the misfortunes which punish the unfilial. In a paper which should be read by every student of religious sociology, Horton (1961) makes a parallel analysis of similar beliefs. Among the Kalabari Ijo of the Niger Delta, words of Destiny spoken by the prenatal self explain the misfortunes of an individual. But in this case, the choices of the prenatal self are judged good or bad for different kinds of deviance. In the Tallensi case, the bad Destiny was chosen by the man who pitted himself against paternal authority and refused the prescriptions of Tallensi social institutions. In the Kalabari case, the bad Destiny is chosen pre- natally by the person who has no taste for the rat race of an entrepre-</page><page sequence="9">59 neurial, individualist society; their good Destiny is that of the ruthless competitive fisherman and merchant. So here would seem tot be a case for sociological determinism. Given the social institutions, the beliefs are differentiated adaptive responses. But Horton's essay is a vehement criticism of such argumentation. One of the staunchest upholders of the independent status of beliefs, Horton makes a program for the comparative study of religion, which I seek to expand and to emulate. The simple question to follow is this: if the Tallensi and the Kalabari are given their beliefs as part of one packet with their insti- tutions, where do the institutions come from? The usual ways in which sociological determinism answers this question are either by maintaining a thorough-going economic determinism which assumes only one possible adaptive strategy to physical conditions, or by allowing for blind chance in the particular set of adaptations made in any one case. The first solu- tion carries all the limitations to any sociology of religion that denies agency to humans and validity to belief. The second, of course, is an abdication from explanation. I shall proceed on another basis. I shall assume there is a full program for a sociology of religion: the interaction of human agents must be its subject; and insofar as they choose beliefs, they choose their institutional forms and try to make sense of them, justi- fying their choices at the same time. Fortes' Oedipus and Job in West African Religion and Horton's elabo- ration of its theme demonstrate what the sociological exercise could still do in its old comparative program. Writing of Fortes' approach to Tallensi beliefs, Horton says: A great virtue of this essay is that it is one of the few recent socio-anthro- pological works to take religious relationships seriously. By this I mean that it treats talk about gods and their involvements with men at its face value, rather than assuming that such talk is 'merely a way of referring to social structure.' Because Fortes accepts the psychological reality of such relation- ships so far as the people involved in them are concerned, he is led to explore their quality in Talle religion with a fullness and depth rarely seen elsewhere. Again, though he follows a well-worn path in correlating cult structure with social structure, his relation of religious notions specifically to features of the individual's passage through society is a new and exciting approach. (Horton, 1961:111). When he makes a summary comparison of the two similar belief systems, Horton draws attention to the local ideas of personality. It is interesting to compare Kalabari ideas about the locus of these per- sonality conflicts firstly with Tallensi ideas and then with the classical Freud- ian ideas themselves. In Kalabari thought, the conflict centers about the desire to engage in status competition: whilst the conscious self pursues and approves competition, the unconscious may abhor it. There is, however, no focus on conflict of attitudes to particular people. In Tallensi thought, by contrast, the conflict centers on a specific person, the father: whilst the conscious self submits to parental authority, the unconscious hates and rejects it. Switching to Europe, classical Freudian doctrines play down con- flict over status rivalry and lay heavy emphasis on conflict over sexual drives; though it should be noted that the American school of 'Neo-Freudians' has rejected the overwhelming sexual emphasis of classical doctrine in favor of conflicts centering on status competition.' These differences are revealing, for they reflect wider differences of cul- tural and structural emphasis. In Kalabari communities, structural arrange-</page><page sequence="10">60 ments are such that the people involved most intensively in status rivalry at any one time are never in any set relationship to one another; this because in questions of accession to leadership of a group, great latitude is allowed for achievement irrespective of ascribed characteristics of age, pedigree, or relationship to other competitors. Again, whilst aggressive competition is formally enjoined in this culture, it is at the same time discouraged in fact, because current beliefs lay such heavy stress on the use of lethal sorcery by way of reprisal. Correspondingly, Kalabari personality theory features an aggressive Conscious and a timid Unconscious. In Tallensi communities, on the other hand, status advancement can only take place at the expense of a specifically related, figure-the father. Hence the ambivalent attitudes de- scribed in Tallensi personality theory feature him in person; as where the yin ('Destiny,' Unconscious Wishes) of a son is said to, be in chronic opposi- tion to the yin of his father. Another point of contrast with Kalabari is that here amity and non-competitiveness are formally enjoined in all the most important relationships, whilst the culture makes no real provision for the frustrations of a son who remains a jural minor till the day of his father's death. In consonance with this, Tallensi personality theory postulates the reverse of Kalabari theory-an amicable Conscious and an aggressive Un- conscious (Horton, 1961:113-114). The Tallensi use a passive voice theory of responsibility to help a victim of misfortune not take the full weight of guilt upon himself. At least he can believe that some limited part of himself entertained the initial ill-will from which his destiny sprang. The Kalabari use the passive voice theory of personality to focus a victim's will to conquer his fate: he is helped to identify that part of himself which is not fully committed to social com- petition. Horton goes on to call for a systematic study in West Africa, which would note the number of divisions of the personality, the desire attributed to each, and the power relations between them. The variations which emerge could be correlated with structural and cultural variables as demonstrated in Horton's comparison of Kalabari and Tallensi. CONCLUSIONS Whereas Horton suggests his program modestly, as an improvement for ethnographic practice, it is also suggestive for the development of psycho- analysis at the point we left it after considering Schafer's linguistic reforms. Psychoanlytic theory seems too much like a ship at anchor, once fitted out for a great voyage, but sails now furled, ropes flapping, motion stilled. It is not as if theoretical winds were lacking to drive it. But the motive to go somewhere is missing. As Muller said, sometimes the will to hold to a great notion can fail. A mere linguistic switch from the passive to the active voice is not going to give psychoanalysis a purpose or plan. The grand conception must be recalled. The original enterprise of psychology was to, chart the human psyche. But that can never be done without charting, at the same time, the range of possible social constraints laid by one person upon another or by hundreds acting in concert. For good success, the psychological approach to meaning surely will have to keep in step with the sociological approach. We can agree easily enough upon a common language; the terms that deal with meaning, action, situation and reasons are good for both disci- plines. But we still need to agree upon methods for using the language.</page><page sequence="11">61 We also need to agree upon whatever it is we want to say. We will not lie down passively under the constraints of a natural science language of causes and determinants. We believe we are free agents and so free to pick up and work at our original idea. In the sociology of religion that idea was to examine the social factors in belief. This program requires the investigator to trace the controls that the human subjects of his research are laying upon each other. If the soci- ologist investigator always checks the constraints upon action which appear as penalties and moral judgments, the investigation itself is protected from his own imported subjective interpretations. The Kalabari and Tallensi make different judgments of failure; they deploy different resources for explaining, reconciling and reinstating or washing their hands of less for- tunate fellowmen. This is the essence of the powerful method in which action terminology can be used. Never denying active human agency, we can trace how people work their institutions as well as create the condi- tions in which their beliefs get plausibility. The task of careful comparison is a heavy one. It can achieve the same ends as those for which the con- ceptual apparatus of sociological determinants of belief was devised. It is a much more exacting program than anything that has been tried in the sociology of religion. But it is a program for our times, both methodo- logically sophisticated and phenomenological in its assumptions.
