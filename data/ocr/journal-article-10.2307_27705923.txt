Pp. xviii+173. $6. Nathan Scott's newest book is a collection of essays on "the post-modern movement" in literature and the allied arts. Most of them have been pub lished elsewhere, but two of the best, "The 'Conscience' of the New Liter ature" and "The Literary Imagination in a Time of Dearth," which formed the basis of the Cole Lectures at Vanderbilt University in 1968, are new. And it is primarily to these, along with the essay "L'Actuelle?The Primary Norm of Our Period Style," first appearing in W. R. Robinson's symposium on the film, Man and the Movies (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1967), that the following commentary will refer. In his persistent effort to give definition to the ragged terrain of the contemporary literary scene, Scott invokes Keats's famous letter to his brothers in which the poet names the quality of mind making for great achievement in literature as "Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason." It is not Keats, however, but the great Ger man existentialist philosopher, Martin Heidegger, who looms as the guiding presence over Scott's book. For as early as the preface, he brings Keats into the context of our time by a brilliant interpretation of his prophetic insight in the light of the later Heidegger's "anti-anthropomorphism." Keats, Scott observes, knew the absurdity of thinking that truth was available for the taking by a willful, rationally oriented mind. He wanted rather "to keep in view the possibility that?as Heidegger would say?the 'advent' of Being must be waited for, patiently . . ., in a spirit of meditative openness to the full amplitude of the world. Heidegger's term is not 'Negative Capability' but Gelassenheit?which means that spirit of disponibilit? before What-Is which permits us simply to let things be whatever may be their uncertainty and their mystery" (p. xiii). It is precisely this waiting in patient silence, this "refusal to compete with reality," as Scott, borrowing from Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities, puts it, which distinguishes the new literature of writers such as Samuel Beckett, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Charles Olson from the earlier "classic moderns" such as W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and D. H. Lawrence. The latter, "knowing themselves to be disinherited of an effective metaphysical machinery for the ordering of experience . . . , proceeded to improvise into existence new systems of meaning and faith" in their search, as Eliot put it, for "a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary his tory." Their essential vehicle, in other words, was myth. The new postmodern literature, on the other hand, is "violently mythoclastic," having its roots in a militant refusal "to compete with the immense panorama of reality in our time" (p. 41). It rejects what Scott, adapting from Robbe-Grillet, calls "the dimension of depth," which means, I think, the sacred or ontological reality inhering in Being, or, from another point of view, the anthropocentric sub jectivity that infuses meaning into man's relation to the world of things. In stead, it affirms l'actuelle, "the sheer thereness of the raw materials in their</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 557 unhumanized facticity" (p. 10). Thus whereas the old moderns were reaching after resolutions in their fictions, the new literature is a radically " 'anti teleological art,' an art which, taking it for granted that the world is without discoverable purposes or goals, devotes itself therefore to random procedures, to methods of improvisation, giving up any highly 'structured syntax of pattern and form,' in order that it may be truly open to the turbulent inco herence of reality" (p. 48). The equation of the antiteleological aesthetic of the postmodern literary imagination with an antiteleological ontology (which reminds one of the similar concerns, if different conclusions, of Frank Kermode in his brilliant book The Sense of an Ending) is the most interesting aspect of Scott's studies. This antiliterature, which, in Scott's always provocative theological meta phors, lies equidistant between Antioch and Alexandria (commitment to historical time or Reality and commitment to timeless idea or Myth), ex presses the posture not of an aggressor, but, in Kafka's term, of a Hunger Artist, who practices "the art of abstention, the art of doing without that which human selfhood needs for its felicity and fulfillment?whereby prep aration is patiently made for the time when the 'world will freely offer itself " (p. 53). In this significant respect, its antianthropomorphism or, to put it in another way, its refusal to search for resolutions to the crises it discovers, is, like the antianthropomorphic philosophy of the later Heidegger and the European theologians he has profoundly influenced, an expression of an age which lies in the uncertain time between the flight of the gods and the return of another. It is also an expression of that "consenting to let things be and to dwell on the earth without restlessly searching all the time for ways of do mesticating reality within the framework of human design and purpose" (p. 81), of that Gelassenheit "before the absolute presence of Being" (p. 62) which alone can activate its luminous disclosure: whether one turns to the novels of Alain Robbe-Grillet and John Hawkes, or to the theatre of Beckett and Pinter, or to the poetry of Charles Olson and John Ashberry? our literature today, in its way of handling the human reality, seems often disinclined to accept the kind of large reconstructive effort so characteristic of traditionalist modernism. Dans le Labyrinthe, The Crying of Lot 4c, Krapp's Last Tape, Naked Lunch, and Les N?gres belong to a new tradition deeply informed by a sense of the world as so radically contingent and indeterminate as to prevent the artist's doing anything other than simply offering an illustration of the chaos. It is a tradition that wants to forswear the old profondeurs; and thus it is a tradition that has tended to sponsor a kind of ethos in which the artist becomes a specialist in Hunger-Art, and adept in the art of doing without?of waiting . . . 'without hope,' [Eliot] since any kind of hope at all would be hope for that which the human experience offers no sanction in an age which is, as Heidegger says, 'the No-more of the gods that have fled and the Not-yet of the god that is coming.' (p. 85) Professor Scott's analysis of the antiteleological form of contemporary literature in terms of the later Heidegger's rejection of "the will to will" in favor of "letting-be" is immensely provocative and demands our closest attention, especially since the spatial perspective of the New Critical estab lishment, which is radically teleological, has simply failed to prepare criticism to encounter meaningfully the thrusts into the realm of antiart by the modern</page><page sequence="3">558 Spanos literary imagination. Where the New Criticism is driven into the futile gesture of invoking the "fallacy of imitative form" against all antiart, Scott's con ception of the work of literary art as something like a microcosm of the writer's macrocosm, that is, a metaphysical and ontological perspective, begins to shed clarifying light on a literature which for most of us, despite our having lived with the Becketts and the Ionescos for twenty years now, has remained a disturbing mystery?if, that is, we haven't subdued the mystery by "getting with it." It is, then, in the spirit of dialogue that I express certain reservations about Professor Scott's equation of contemporary antiteleological form with the Heideggerian posture of Gelassenheit. I cannot help feeling that there is a logical leap or a misplaced emphasis in the central passage quoted above between the idea that the form of the new literature is infused by a deep sense of an indeterminate and contingent world and the conclusion that it tends to sponsor a kind of Heideggerian waiting in the No-more of the gods that have fled and the Not-yet of the god that is coming. (Indeed, I am inclined to believe that Scott is himself aware of this uneasy discordia concors, since it is obviously an extremely reluctant peace he makes with Robbe-Grillet's critical theory and novelistic practice in order to bring this militant spokesman for antiliterature into the circumference of Heidegger's concept of Gelassenheit.) I certainly agree with Scott's description of the new literature, but I am not so sure that most postmodern works, not even as paradigmatic an instance as Waiting for Godot, generate an attitude of passive waiting. On the contrary, this literature (when it is not indulging in angelic flights out of time) is primarily a literature of assault on a mankind that has increasingly hardened its skin against the intimations of radical mortality, or, to shift the metaphor, that has rigidified its positivistic teleology in the obsessive effort to negate the threat of the contingent. Its anti-form is not intended to trap us "into a kind of radical amazement at the simple thereness of the world" (p. n) or as a upreparatio" (p. 54) "for The Holy . . . , the 'advent' (kommen) of Being itself" (p. 74). It is intended rather to smash those protective and self-decep tive frames of reference of modern man which make him feel comfortably justified, at home, as it were, in an alien world, and to drive him into the dreadful realm of what the early Heidegger calls die Unheimlich, the uncanny or, what is the same thing, the not-at-home. (It will be observed, by the way, that, despite my reservations about Scott's conclusion, the argument about postmodern literature has still, as he observes, to be carried out in Heidegger's terms.) It is not, as Scott too often comes close to saying, the possibility of plenitude that Beckett or Ionesco or Robbe-Grillet reveals; it is, rather, the terrible superfluity of things. It is not wonder and its intimations of unity that they activate; it is dread and its vision of radical solitude. This is why Aristotle (to whom Scott, strangely, does not refer in his discussions of postmodern literary form) is such a negative presence in this literature. As the pervasive "anti-Aristotelianism" of writers like Ionesco, Brecht, and Robbe-Grillet bears witness, he represents, in radical antithesis to Heidegger, that metaphysical-aesthetic tradition (which in modern times has, under the influence of positivistic science, taken the form of the well made work) that insists on the primacy of plot in order to objectify and thus</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 559 evade the objectless dread, or, rather, the dread that has no-thing (das Nicht) as its object, or, to put it in another way, in order to name and thus domesti cate the secret cause of human suffering in the cathartic concordances of an end. I want again, however, to insist that my argument with Professor Scott is quantitative rather than qualitative in essence. I disagree with his general emphasis, not with his analysis of the nature of the form and content of post modern literature. The distinction he makes in these studies between the classical and the postclassical moderns stands as one of the most articulate, if all too tantalizingly general, descriptions we have to date of what is happen ing in the arts of our time, and it is to be recommended to anyone seriously interested in the nature of "modernism."
