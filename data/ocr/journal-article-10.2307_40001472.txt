<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Artistic Consistency of Browning's In a Balcony P. G. MUDFORD Abstract. "In a Balcony" derives its artistic consistency from the un- conscious motivation of the characters and reveals unresolved problems in Browning's life. An examination of the psychological roots of the narrative illuminates issues that have bothered some critics: e.g. Stall's concern for the ease with which the Queen is deceived into thinking that Norbert loves her; and Symons', Brooke's and Herford's concern that Constance's behavior is psychologically inappropriate. The roots of the work are of a very deep kind involving the associa- tion of the theme of incest with barrenness and sacrifice. Despite her marriage the Queen still gives her affection to her cousin Constance-a situation which may account for the defect of her marital relationship, but more importantly suggests the existence of a bond between her and her kin that includes a barrier against incest and the demands of sexual love. The Queen is easily deceived into thinking Norbert loves her, for Norbert has for some time embodied an ideal of asexual love. Constance's sacrifice is, then, an act of propitiatory sacrifice to the Queen's affection for her and an explana- tion of the horror that grows palpable between them. Unconscious ele- ments in the poem may involve the identification of Browning's author- itarian mother with the Queen and reflect on the difficult role Brown- ing's mother played in her son's life during the years of his marriage in Italy. his recent collection of critical essays on Robert Browning, Philip Drew has usefully drawn attention to the bewilderingly various judgments that In a Balcony has attracted.1 The poem is rep- resented in Drew's collection by an extract from Professor Elmer Edgar Stall's From Shakespeare to Joyce. Stall himself concentrates (and this is his major interest in that book) on the use of conventions or postulates in the tragic situation which dispense with probability for the sake of some higher artistic end: here- a "superbly ironical contretemps." The improbability of the poem, according to Stall, consists in the ease with which the Queen is deceived into thinking that Norbert loves her, and in Constance's and Norbert's willingness 1 Robert Browning: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Philip Drew (Lon- don, 1966), pp. 178-188. 31</page><page sequence="2">32 Victorian Poetry to take the risk of deceiving her. This is the inescapable price of the supreme situation (one of "ironical contrasts and tumultuous passions" brought alive by the "perceptibly individual accent and justified by love' "). In arguing his point of view, Stoll reviews the opinions of Arthur Symons, C. H. Herford, and Stopford A. Brooke. These critics had all seen the chief difficulty of the scene in Constance's behavior; and each had, in different respects, got it wrong. According to Symons, Constance relinquishes Norbert in favor of the Queen because "with very feminine but singularly unloverlike instinct, she resolves, as she would phrase it, to sacrifice herself, not seeing that she is insulting her lover by the very notion of his accepting a sacrifice. Her character has not the pure and steadfast nobility of Norbert's but ... it is genuinely human" (pp. 179-180). Herford's view of Constance is even more sympathetic. "Between these powerful, rigid, and simple natures stands Constance, ardent as they, but with the lithe and palpitating ardour of a flame. She is concentrated Romance." Stopford A. Brooke, on the other hand, finds "the lying of Constance unendurable." And he sees Constance's self-sacrifice as "more like Jealousy" than nobility of nature or pity for the Queen (p. 180). Stoll objects to Brooke's view on the grounds that he has not "at the outset yielded himself frankly and freely to the spell, as the common man, reader or spectator, either, would do. ... If the critic had responded generously and adequately to the situation between Constance and the Queen after the latter gets the news, he would have found the justifications for the violations of probability, the answers to his troubled questions" (p. 181). Stop- ford A. Brooke is inadequate as a critic "because he is confined with- in a formula- realistic, psychological and moral." He therefore fails to recognize- according to Stoll- "the price paid for a bigger, higher effect than the probable" (p. 182). With the larger heresies in Professor Stoll's views, regarding the unaccommodated man for whom the popular little tragedy is intend- ed, I shall not contend.2 Rather I intend to show, first, that what Professor Stoll describes as the initial improbability is not an im- probability at all; secondly, that Constance's behavior is not psy- chologically inappropriate; and that while it is in Mr. Symons' words "genuinely human," it is not to be explained by Professor Herford's idea of "concentrated Romance" (a merely mystifying piece of anthropomorphism), or by Brooke's notion of a study in jealousy, 2 On this point, see J. I. M. Stewart, Character and Motive in Shakespeare (London, 1947).</page><page sequence="3">P. G. Mudford 33 which, as Stoll points out, does not seem an adequate description of Constance's behavior after she understands the Queen's mistake. Thirdly, I intend to show that the whole scene does have an artistic consistency, and one in which we can by no means discount- as Professor DeVane desires3- that one of the characters is a "queen and another a prime minister." I intend to argue these points by reference to the material of the narrative whose roots, I shall suggest, are of a very deep kind, involving the association of the theme of incest with barrenness and sacrifice.4 Some forty years later Wilde explored these more openly in his play of Salome. And there, as here, a pledge became of dramatic and psychological significance in awakening the dangerous potentialities of an incest wish- previously held in some kind of balance by repression. In both plays too, anxiety acts as a predominant emotion, creating dramatic tension, and re- vealing the power of psychological menace when its nature remains unspecified. The failure to recognize these elements in Browning's scene accounts, as I think, for the dissatisfaction of the critics whose views have been illustrated. It will at once be apparent, though, that the Freudian terminology I have already used has its dangers and limitations, but it seems to me, in this case, justified, because it makes possible a complete account of the poem's material. And at the very least it saves one of Browning's own favorite poems from dismemberment or dismissal. The most interesting passage, quoted by Stoll, is Professor Her- ford's view of the Queen. He writes of her: "A 'lavish soul' long starved, but kindling into the ecstasy of girlhood at the seeming touch of love; then, as her dream is shattered by the indignant honesty of Norbert, transmuted at once into the daemonic Gudrun or Brynhild glaring in speechless whiteheat and implacable frenzy upon the man who has scorned her proffered heart and the hapless girl he has chosen" (p. 180). This is well stated, and I want to begin by tracing the course of the Queen's double transformation. When the scene begins, Constance is trying to persuade Norbert not to ask the Queen to approve their marriage in recompense for his services as Prime Minister. "You choose," she says, "the single thing she will not grant." And she knows this through her understanding of women's 3 A Browning Handbook (New York, 1955), p. 252: "As in Colombe, we have three persons in a political situation, but again it is of little importance that one is a queen and another a prime minister/' 4 In The Golden Bough, abridged edition (New York, 1922), p. 141, Sir James Frazer points out how the crime of incest was supposed to cause a death. It had therefore to be atoned by an expiatory sacrifice to the goddess of fertility.</page><page sequence="4">34 Victorian Poetry hearts, as well as her knowledge of the Queen's nature and past life. This she explains to Norbert a little later. You told the Queen you served her for herself; If so, to serve her was to serve yourself, She thinks, for all your unbelieving face! I know her. In the hall, six steps from us, One sees the twenty pictures: there's a life Better than life, and yet no life at all. Conceive her born in such a magic dome, Pictures all round her! why, she sees the world, Can recognize its given things and facts, The fight of giants or the feast of gods, Sages in senate, beauties at the bath, Chases and battles, the whole earth's display, Landscape and sea-piece, down to flowers and fruit- And who shall question that she knows them all, In better semblance than the things outside? Yet bring into the silent gallery Some live thing to contrast in breath and blood, Some lion, with the painted lion there- You think she'll understand composedly? (11. 100-118) The Queen's knowledge of the actual world is remote, filtered to her through art. And so it is with some surprise that we learn later in the scene that the Queen has a husband. The marriage, though, only exists in name and is childless; the Queen herself re- gards it as hateful. As a result, she has grown old under an enforced emotional repression whose anguish she admits: There have been moments, if the sentinel Lowering his halbert to salute the queen, Had flung it brutally and clasped my knees, I would have stooped and kissed him with my soul. (11. 421-424) And this prolonged repression has caused a change in the Queen's nature, as Constance points out: for, in that thin frame Pain-twisted, punctured through and through with cares, There lived a lavish soul until it starved, Debarred of healthy food. (11. 271-274) The Queen underlines this again in her references to herself as "marble," and in the evident pain with which she contemplates Con- stance's possible relationship to Norbert: You could not loiter in that garden, step Into this balcony, but I straight was stung And forced to understand. (11. 446-448) Constance leaves us in no doubt that her anxiety about the Queen originates in some understanding of the effects which the repression of natural emotions has produced. The Queen will be forced to see the unreality and deadness of her own life, if Norbert makes a dis-</page><page sequence="5">P. G. Mudford 35 play of his love for Constance; and the results of this, she makes us feel, are likely to be dangerous: "I do not bid you wake her tender- ness, / (That were vain truly- none is left to wake)" (11. 287-288). What Norbert does wake, as we subsequently learn, is the "passion of a long-thwarted nature" which turns to hate when the mistaken assumption of his love is revealed. And this brings us back to what Stoll calls the improbability of the success of the deception. Here, we need to reflect for a moment on the conceivable nature of the Queen's relationship to Norbert. She is, Constance insists, a "withered woman"; Norbert is at the height of his powers as a man. And consistent with this, the force of the Queen's affection is not directed toward any normal sexual relationship, but a celebration of the fact that she is still lovable: Constance, I had abjured the hope of love And being loved, as truly as yon palm The hope of seeing Egypt from that plot. (11. 356-358) Norbert represents, in fact, an ideal in the Queen's life- absent until that time, except in the pale substitute of Constance herself: "I took you to my heart to keep it warm, / When the last chance of love seemed dead in me" (11. 381-382). The relationship of the Queen to her kinswoman is particularly close; and at times she seems almost to echo Norbert's manner of talking to Constance: "I love you, Constance, from my soul" and again, "O Constance, how I love you!" A few pages further on, she insists again: How I loved you from the first! Some queens would hardly seek a cousin out And set her by their side to take the eye! (11. 488-490) In spite of the Queen's kindling at Norbert's supposed proposal, this spontaneous overflow of feeling gives us no grounds for suppos- ing it insincere; and yet at the end of the scene the Queen and Constance are left glaring at each other like panthers. We are aware at this moment of an artistic propriety, at first inexplicable- but clearly connected in some way with Constance's initial insistence on the peculiar subtleties of women's hearts. A natural solution seems to me to occur in the following way. Despite her marriage the Queen still disposes of her affection on a close member of her own family: a situation that may in itself account for the defects of her marital relationship, but more importantly suggests the existence of a bond between her and her kin that would typically include a barrier against incest, and a horror of the demands made by sexual love5- 5 On this point, Freud's essay on some of the distinguishing characteristics of feminine psychology is useful.

In this interpretation the ease with which the Queen is deceived explains itself as the bringing to light of a situation on which she has for some time relied, with Norbert embodying an ideal of asexual love, and Constance acting as the object of an affection that appears irreproachable to the Queen, but is nevertheless perceptibly inclusive of two highly charged and dangerous elements. Such a solution makes sense too of the eventual substitution of the Queen's love for Constance by hate: the result, in the betrothal of Constance to Norbert, of the removal of those psychologically desirable buttresses on which the Queen's emotional orientation depends. As in Salome, the dramatic handling of the theme of repression turns upon a pledge. During Norbert's year of service, the terms of his recompense have been left unspecified; between him and the Queen there exists an unwritten debt which she has an obligation to settle. And the action of the scene depends first upon Constance's at- tempt to prevent Norbert from asking the Queen to settle the debt in the way he wants; and secondly, upon the disastrous effects to the Queen's personality when he does: "I gravely wait / Your pleasure, madam: where is my reward?" (11. 795-796). And his reward turns out to be, as we know, the Queen's impassioned hate. In both plays then, the pledge is the vehicle of dramatic tension and the means of bringing to light dark impulses, which cause the final tragic situation. What then is the significance of the part played by the enigmatic Constance? At the opening of In a Balcony, Browning captures the interest of his reader by communicating Constance's anxiety: Norbert. Let me ask now, Love! Constance. Do, and ruin us! (11. 9-10) Constance's anxiety, both in relation to their ruin and the loss of Norbert, is, in one respect, an accurate assessment of the Queen's possible response, justified by the final outcome of the drama. But, as we listen to Constance, we become aware of other elements in her anxiety which do not seem so well accounted for, and which betray a surplus or excess in her emotion: Had I not loved you from the very first, Were I not yours, could we not steal out thus So wickedly, so wildly, and so well, You might become impatient. ... (11. 180-184)</page><page sequence="7">P. G. Mudford 37 A year of this compression's ecstasy All goes for nothing! you would give this up For the old way, the open way, the world's, His way who beats, and his who sells his wife! (11. 195-198) In short, Constance appears to derive an emotional satisfaction from the secrecy of their relationship; and from the idea that they are "embracing under death's dark hand." Secondly, when she sees con- cealment is no longer possible, she reveals another motive for in- ducing Norbert to make his request in a devious way: her own particularly close relationship to the Queen: I give her love: I feel I ought to help her, and I will. So, for her sake, as yours, I tell you twice That women hate a debt as men a gift. (11. 299-302) And a few lines further on she states, I owe that withered woman everything- Life, fortune, you, remember! (11. 334-335) Constance's anxiety is thus composed of three separate strands: fear for their love, love of compression's ecstasy, and a desire to protect the Queen. In particular, the last two mediate that surplus of anxiety which is surprising and perplexing. No obscurity at all, however, clouds its practical effects. In the second part, when Constance realizes the Queen's mistake, she is willing to let Norbert go with a feeble "He shall" (1. 581). And in the third, she behaves to him as though her sacrifice results from some necessity that can- not be tampered with. She even fails to tell Norbert precisely what has happened; and we catch in this extraordinary prevarication a tone of both guilt and necessary expiation: We cannot kiss, a second day like this; Else were this earth no earth. (11. 625-626) A few moments later, she turns to talking about art. Again, this is very puzzling: unfeminine, and inconsistent with the power of her actual feelings. It is inconceivable, on a moment's reflection, that any woman as much in love with Norbert as Constance is made out to be, could resign him to an older withered woman without some sign of moral struggle- even with all the nobility that Symons at- tributes to her. And yet it is difficult not to agree with him that her behavior seems "genuinely human"- and to resist the spell of the verse when Constance, in fantasy, contemplates the memory of her one moment of love: -I try to see those years- I think I see. You walk quick and new warmth comes; you look back And lay all to the first glow- not sit down Forever brooding on a day like this While seeing embers whiten and love die. (11. 628-632)</page><page sequence="8">38 Victorian Poetry At least the verse carries over to us the powerfulness of Constance's affections; and it is precisely these that are in question. There seems to me one way out of this dilemma; and this is to admit what the poetry suggests. Constance yields because she finds it more satisfy- ing than facing the source of unspecified danger, symptomized by her anxiety. Why should this be so? Surely, it must depend on Constance's recognition, at some level, of the real situation among the three of them, before which she feels psychologically helpless. On this account, Constance's sense of the fitness of what she does depends on an act- not at all of self-sacrifice- but of propitiatory sacrifice for that affection in the Queen, directed upon her, that we may take to be the source of all that is realistic in her anxiety. Such an account is not only consistent with the themes of barrenness and incest already illustrated, but it makes the best possible sense of the play's end. The horror that grows palpable between Constance and the Queen illustrates for the first time the irreconcilable nature of their affective impulses. But the Queen, after overcoming an attack of vertigo- itself commonly associated with psychological trauma- retires. And with the situation thus brought out into the open, Constance achieves a larger degree of identification with Norbert than ever before. They have arrived, as he says, at the center of the laby- rinth, reminding us not only of their devious pathway, but of the harm wrought by the illicit love that gave birth to the Minotaur. For a moment or two the lovers enjoy their new enfranchisement. And then we come to the ambiguous climax which has caused much discussion: Constance. There's the music stopped. What measured heavy tread? It is one blaze About me and within me. Norbert. Oh, some death Will run its sudden finger round this spark And sever us from the rest! Constance. And so do well. Now the doors open, Norbert. 'T is the guard comes. Constance. Kiss! (11. 914-919) The point at issue is whether the guard comes to arrest the lovers, or whether the cessation of the music and the measured heavy tread tell us that the Queen herself has died of the compulsion to face the real situation and the guard is coming to announce this. The second explanation was favored by Browning himself. "The Queen," he said, "had a large and passionate temperament, which had only once been touched and brought into intense life. She would have died as by a knife in her heart. The guard would have come to carry away</page><page sequence="9">P. G. Mudford 39 her dead body."6 In spite of the poet's assertion, the ambiguity re- mains. Browning's reading is surely not the one that strikes most readers; nor does it, on reflection, seem exclusively convincing. What we have here, I think, is the fusion of two possible endings, ap- propriate to the imaginative material of the scene. In the first, the lovers become the propitiation of the hatred that has its origin in the Queen's awakening. And the lyrical sincerity of their relationship makes them particularly suited to their role as sacrificial victims. In the second, the Queen's death becomes a simple refusal to face the reality of the situation. Both seem to me consistent; the weakness exists, however, in Browning's failure to suggest any clear imaginative resolution. Our response to the scene is left unsatisfactorily blurred; and the blurring is not, in this case, an addition to the poetic effect. Conceivably, what may have happened is that Browning's characteris- tic preoccupation with the idea of Love led him at the very end to shy away from a total acceptance of the imaginative level at which he had been working; and, in his inclination to get the emphasis on that final fervid kiss, he pitched the key a little too high. In any case, the problem is typical of Browning's verse in which the mind of the poet adumbrates impulses that his conscious thoughts seem very far from coming to terms with. Unlike Salome, the themes of incest and sacrifice are here heavily concealed; but, as I have tried to show, the recognition of their presence provides a key to the poem's powerful imaginative effect. This does not mean, on the one hand, that the more literary pleasures of irony and dramatic suspense, for example, are to be discounted; or, on the other, that the claims to be made for this poem can not be exaggerated. It lacks the quality of work intensely brooded, and springs from the bedrock of Browning's imagination with a directness that deprives it of complexity in feeling (though not of emotion) and richness of association which is to be found in poems like "Fra Lippo Lippl." And I want, in conclusion, to suggest one further reason why this might be so. It derives from the poet's own life. In her biography of Browning, Betty Miller has revealed how Browning's father showed an "almost total dependence upon the will of others"7; and how the vital decisions of family life were made by his mother. Strict in her religious beliefs and authoritarian in manner, Mrs. Browning was destined to conflict with her son's evolving character as a poet. Recalling Freud's observation that a child's parents often appear in his dreams idealized as King and 6 DeVane, p. 253. 7 Robert Browning, a Portrait (London, 1952), p. 6.</page><page sequence="10">40 Victorian Poetry Queen, we may well consider the significance of there being a single monarch in Browning's poem, and she a woman whose influence has to be destroyed before her Prime Minister's love can be fulfilled. And we may note, in addition, Norbert's preference for the Queen's cousin- a transference already sufficiently elucidated- which may well go some way toward explaining the difficult role Browning's mother played in her son's life during the years of his marriage in Italy. I am suggesting, in short, that the unconscious material of this poem reveals unresolved problems in the poet's own personal life- and that the weaknesses of the work stem from this material being in- sufficiently worked. So far as they are taken, the emotions remain, however, the stuff of which great poetry can be made. At least such a view of the relationship between poet and poem would fit in well with the interpretation of the poem I have suggested, and would avoid the invidious dismissal of elements in the deliberate poetic artifice that Professor DeVane recommends.
