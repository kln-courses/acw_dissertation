<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE TRINITARIAN DOCTRINE OF EUSEBIUS OF EMESA The Eusebius with whom this article1 deals was born in Edessa, Syria, around 300 A. D.2 His mother-tongue was Syriac. While still a boy he studied the Bible, and his well-to-do Christian parents allow ed him to attend a local school where he learned the then fashionable language, Greek. As a young man he furthered his study of Scripture under the direction of the Arian bishop Patrophilus of Scythopolis and the famous historian Eusebius of Cesarea. In 326 or 330,3 at the moment when the patriarch Eustathius was deposed on the charge of Sabellianism, Eusebius was in Antioch. He remained there for several years, still, as it seems, pursuing his studies. Fearing the responsibilities of the priesthood, he at length left for Alexandria where he took courses in philosophy and the sciences.4 Upon his return to Antioch in 335 or shortly after that date, he was proposed by the less orthodox synod of 340 A. D. to succeed Saint Athanasius as patriarch of Alexandria. He wisely refused, but accepted the bishopric of Emesa, a Syrian town now called Homs.

If E. SCHWARTZ and H. CHAD WICK (The Fall of Eustathius of Antioch, art. in The Journal of Theol. Studies XLIX, 1948, 27—35) are right, we shall have to admit that Eusebius had already come to Antioch in 326, since the sources of our biography simply say that he was there when the great Nicene champion had to quit his patriarchate. If the theory of Schwartz-Chad wick is correct, it strengthens our hypothesis that Eusebius was born before 300 A. D.; see L'Héritage littéraire 64. 4 A successor of Eusebius, Nemesius of Emesa, wrote around 400 a tract in psychology that is sometimes considered to be the first Christian work of that type. The alleged connection between this writing and the scientific studies or the works of Eusebius of Emesa is rather hypothetical. 34</page><page sequence="2">Eusebius of Emesa 35 senians did not relish having a scholarly bishop, and the newly-elected Eusebius soon had to quit his diocese. Through the intervention of Georges of Laodicea, who eventually became the first biographer of Eusebius, the patriarch of Antioch himself went down to Emesa and finally installed Eusebius, regardless of the Emesenians' accusation of his being a Sabellianist. The subsequent years of Eusebius' life are not too well known. An Armenian tradition, based on a still extant sermon of his, has it that at one time he was preaching in Jerusalem,6 and two Syrian manuscripts of the Sixth Century contain four small fragments of a speech he delivered at Beirut.6 We know with certainty too that he accompanied the emperor Constantius during the Roman expeditions against the Persians. Eusebius' presence at any of the synods held during these years is not attested to, but this fact cannot be taken as evidence that he abdicated as bishop of Emesa. Eusebius died before the Council of Seleucia (September 359 A. D.), most probably in Antioch, since it was in this city that he was buried. Some modern scholars tell us that Eusebius of Emesa is mentioned in certain ancient martyrologies. However, our research in Latin, Greek, and Oriental literature to find the sources for these statements has been without success. It is true that the Armenian copyists like to refer to Eusebius as "Surb" (Saint) or "Eraneli" (Blessed); and in medieval Latin writings he is quoted as "Beatus" or "Sanctus Eusebius Emi senus".7 But that proves only, if anything, that the respective authors consider him, rightly or wrongly, an orthodox writer. According to Fourth and Fifth Century sources, Eusebius of Emesa was a prolific writer, his specialty being discourses and biblical commen ' L'Héritage littéraire 44* (Armenian text), 79* (our Latin translation of that text); for the authenticity of the sermon, see ibid. 117—120. • Ibid. 33*—34* (Syriac texts), 71* (our Latin version) ; description of the manuscripts La collection de Troyes XXXI—XXXII and XXXVII.

In fact, the medieval Latin writers commit a double mistake: Eusebius of Emesa is not a saint, and the text quoted under his name does not belong to his authentic work;, the facts are sufficiently proved (see e. g. L'Héritage littéraire 94—95 and 159—161) ; consequently, we find it rather strange that even very recent publications perpetuate that old error.</page><page sequence="3">36 E. M. BUYTAERT taries. Up to very recently, however, it was accepted among the better critics that almost everything he wrote was lost; but now we believe that much more is extant than was formerly thought. We still possess in the original Greek one sermon, "De poenitentia", formerly published among the apocrypha of Saint Basil the Great ; an old Latin version of some twenty-nine discourses, fourteen of which have been published since the Seventeenth Century under the name of Eusebius of Cesarea8; one of these Latin sermons is partly preserved in Greek, another partly in Armenian, and still another partly in Syriac.9 Moreover, there are some twenty-seven other fragments in Syriac translation, pieces taken from at least eight different sermons; and three fragmentary dis courses in Armenian. We still have a great number of Greek fragments of Eusebius' biblical commentaries, and these are also partly preserved in an Armenian version.10 His commentary in ten books on the Epistle to the Galatians seems to be lost, however, with the exception of a few fragments.11 It is anticipated that the Armenian manuscripts will yield still more of his sermons,12 and the Greek "Catenae" undoubtedly contain more unpublished fragments of his biblical commentaries. In preparing the following notes on the Trinitarian doctrine of Euse bius of Emesa, — as far as writings of our author were used, — we have restricted ourselves to his discourses.13 8 Eusebii Pamphili Caesareae in Palaestina Episcopi opuscula XIIII nunc primum in lucern edita studio et opere Iacobi SIRMONDI S.

We are less optimistic, as we fear that the copyist of the manuscript made the mistake so common in Armenian codices, viz., the confusion of Eusebius of Emesa with Severian of Gabala, the latter frequently called in Armenian sources "Severian of Emesa". Actually, in contradiction to the general rubric of the collection, the sermons 9 and 12 of the Djulfa manuscript are individually attributed to Severian. 13 Mainly the 29 Latin discourses now published in vol. 26—27 of the Spicilegium sacrum Lovaniense.</page><page sequence="4">Eusebius of Emesa 37 Upon analyzing the literature on the Christian doctrine of the Fourth Century, particularly on Eusebius of Emesa, we discovered that the more recent authors do not agree at all on placing Eusebius' trinitarian doc trine. The bishop of Emesa has been called a pure Arian, a Semi-Arian, a Macedonian,14 an orthodox writer. Those considering him a Semi Arian sometimes define their opinion saying that he was an Homoian, or close to the Homoiousians, or simply an Homoiousian. Some authors claim that he was teaching an antiquated Origenism, others that he was against the school of Origen. And, since during his lifetime Eusebius was accused of Sabellianism, his case presents about every tone of the doctrinal gamut of the Fourth Century. What then was Eusebius of Emesa in fact? In answering this question we have to use at least three criteria: Eusebius' life, the opinion of the authors of Christian antiquity, and the writings of Eusebius himself. The conclusions obtained with the aid of one criterion have to be controlled by the others, the decisive criterion being an objective analysis of Eusebius' writings. This latter observation is most important, because it seems that the reason why the modern authors are so contradictory in explaining the doctrine of Eusebius, is exactly that they analyzed only some short fragments of his, or none of his writings at all.15 X. The Testimony of Antiquity. Modern authors speaking about the trinitarian doctrine of Eusebius of Emesa usually mention only two texts: one from Saint Jerome's Chronicon16 and another from Theodoret's Eranistes17. Jerome calls our author "a standard-bearer of the Arian faction", and according to the text of Theodoret the works of Eusebius are Arian or at least influenced by Arianism. We do not deny, of course, the existence of these texts, but the question is how to interpret them. 14 This anachronistic theory was expounded by H. JORDAN, Geschichte der altchristlichen Liieratur (Leipzig 1911) 283 and 293. Since Eusebius died at the very latest in the spring of 359, he cannot have been a Macedonian. 15 Of course, we cannot severely accuse the authors of modern times writing before 1920—1921, since they did not have too much to analyze. 16 Edit. R. HELM (Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte, Eusebius VII 1), 236, lines 20—21 : "Eusebius Emisenus Arrianae signifer factionis multa et varia conscribit".— According to Helm Saint Jerome writes the name of the heretic "Arrius", and in consequence "Arrianus", etc. ; that is the reason why the reader will find this orthography in our text. 17 P. G. 83 312.</page><page sequence="5">38 E.M.BUYTAERT It is understood that Saint Jeroms, in his judgment of authors more or less contemporaneous with him, is frequently rather severe and even unjust. In his Chronicon, for instance, we find a clear example in the passage where he speaks about Saint Basil the Great.18 Jerome testifies that Basil, bishop of Cesarea in Cappadocia is, in 376 A. D., a famous man; but adds that through his haughtiness he nullifies all his good qualities. We always risk being unjust, if we simply follow or admit the square judgement of Saint Jerome on personalities of the Fourth Century. A consequence of this conclusion is that, in the case of Eusebius of Emesa, we have to check how Jerome in his Chronicon understands the substantive or adjective "Arian", and whether his notion can be justified. The Chronicon uses the term "Arrianus-Arriani" seventeen times.19 The literal translation of course is always "Arian". But, if we consider the facts described by Jerome as we know them by other means, we find that a version "quoad sensum" of the word is in most cases "Arian minded", that is, ranging from the purest Arians to those persons who admit the Nicene doctrine as described and defended by Saint Athana sius and Saint Hilary, but who object only to the validity or the opportuneness of using the "homousios". Or it means "Semi-Arian, anti-Nicene"; and again "anti-Nicene" is not forcibly equivalent to unorthodox, since it includes those who make a reservation concerning the opportuneness of the much debated "consubstantial". In the mind of Jerome, it seems, the word "Arian" always includes some sort of unorthodoxy, but that does not say that the reality covered by the term is necessarily always real unorthodoxy. All this may sound rather paradoxical, and the critical reader certainly has the right to expect some evidence in favor of our assertions. Jerome, describing the ecclesiastical situation under Constantius, says that around 339 the Arian impiety of the emperor persecuted Saint Athanasius and other non-Arian bishops, sending them into exile or putting them in prison.20 Now, that exile of Athanasius, from 339 to 345, was not the work of Constantius. Furthermore, it is acknowledged by modern scholars that the emperor was not, at that time, a pure 18 Edit. cit. 248, lines g—12: "Basilius Caesariensis episcopus Cappadociae clarus habetur, qui multa continentiae et ingenii bona uno superbiae malo perdidit". 19 Ibid. 232, lines 11—12; 234,1. 5 and 26; 235,1. 18, 22 and 25—26; 236, 1. 20 (Eusebius of Emesa) ; 237,1. 4, 9 and 20; 240,1. 3 and 13; 241, 1. 22 and 25; 242, 1. 17; 245, 1. 4; 246, 1. 3. 20 Ibid. 234—235.</page><page sequence="6">Eusebius of Emesa 39 Arian. He favored the majority of the bishops of his (oriental) empire, who were Semi-Arians, allowing them different opinions on particular points within the frame of their common doctrine. Upon relating the exile of Eustathius of Antioch, the Chronicon mentions that from that time down to the moment Jerome composed his work, all the bishops of Antioch — and they are indicated by name — were Arians.21 However, no modern scholar maintains that Eulalius, Eusebius, Euphronius, Flacillus, and the others were simply Arians. In our terminology they were not more than Semi-Arians. Jerome's text on the see of Jerusalem is still more clearly in favor of our interpretation.22 At the year 348 Jerome announces that Maximus, bishop of Jerusalem and successor of Macarius, died. Thereupon, he says, that church was overrun by Arian bishops: Cyril, Eutyches, again Cyril, Irenaeus, a third time Cyril, Hilary, and a fourth time Cyril.23 Now, this "Arian" Cyril is not only acknowledged by the Catholic Church as a saint, and, since 1883, as a Doctor of the Church, but a strict historical analysis of his Catecheses, a work composed most likely in 348, proves that at that time Saint Cyril was anti-Nicene in the sense that he absolutely avoided the use of the Nicene "consub stantial", because this term, according to him, favored Sabellianism. Practically, however, he was an orthodox author, admitting the doctrine of Nicea while rejecting its terminology.24 The Arians and Semi-Arians understood well that this verbally anti-Nicene bishop actually was a Nicene author, and accordingly sent him into exile three times.25 It is clear, it seems, that Jerome's notion of "Arrianus" is much broader than our term "Arian". Consequently, in the case of Eusebius of Emesa, it is unjustifiable to conclude directly from the Chronicon, without further considerations, that the Syrian bishop was an out 21 Ibid. 232, lines 7—17. 22 Ibid. 237, lines 3—15. 23 From this text it appears that the Chronicon was written at the earliest in 378, since in that year, coming back from his third and longest exile, Saint Cyril was for the fourth time in actual control of the see of Jerusalem. 24 See, for instance, J. LEBON, La position de saint Cyrille de Jérusalem dans les luttes provoquées par l'arianisme, art. in Revue d'Histoire eccl. XX (1924) 181—210, 357—386. 25 See B. ALTANER, Patrologie (2d edit. Freiburg 1950) 268; or better G. BARD Y in De la paix constantinienne à la mort de Théodose (Histoire de l'Eglise by A. FLICHE &amp; V. MARTIN, t. 3) 167: first exile in 357 A. D., through the intervention of Acacius of Cesarea, a Semi-Arian himself, but less close to Nicea than Cyril of Jerusalem; 170—171: second exile in 360 through the Homoian synod of Constantinople; Cyril was a third time exiled by the Homoian emperor Valens in 367.</page><page sequence="7">40 E. M. BUYTAERT standing Arian.26 A possible meaning of Jerome's phrase is that Euse bius, among people with some sort of anti-Nicene leanings, was a rather important personality. The text of Theodoret is less troublesome, since it says that the works of Eusebius of Emesa were written under the influence of the Arian doctrine, adding that they aptly and rightly defend the impassibility of the Logos' divinity, though they try to show that the Father is greater than the Son. That means that in our terminology Eusebius is to be called a Semi-Arian or a Subordinationist. We stated above that, in describing the trinitarian doctrine of Euse bius, usually only these two texts of Jerome and Theodoret are quoted. Now, first of all, in the later works of both these authors, their judgment on Eusebius of Emesa become, it seems, less severe.27 Secondly, anti quity has left us much more than just these rather short texts. For instance, in Syrian literature, Eusebius is quoted or referred to by Philoxene of Mabbug,28 James of Edessa,29 and Ebedjesu bar Berika.30 As far as we can judge from their writings, none of them had any idea that Eusebius was an Arian. In Armenian writings he is quoted among the "God-inspired" Fathers, who are the sources of the unknown author of the work entitled Seal of the Faith;31 and two theologians of the Arme nian catholicos Khatchik Arsharunik use his writings in their disputes with the Byzantines, enumerating him among the "columns of the Church".32 In Greek and Latin, too, we find more texts than those of Jerome and Theodoret. Saint Jerome in his De viris illustribus informs us that 26 The mistake was made by an author, who, not unlike Saint Jerome, loves to judge his fellow-writers without too many nuances, namely L. S.

Theo doret says that Eusebius wrote against the Marcionists,34 and both Epi phanius of Salamis and Theodoret mention that he attacked Mani.35 It is not evident that the latter fact has anything to do with trinitarian doctrine, but on the other hand it is suggestive that the same Epi phanius — whose self-imposed task was to unmask every possible heretic — does not list Eusebius of Emesa among the Arians or Semi Arians. Facing this rather vague and even somewhat contradictory testimony of antiquity, one cannot reach a final conclusion. At any rate, it is an exaggeration to maintain that Eusebius of Emesa was a pure Arian. It seems fair to say, however, that he was anti-Nicene, and perhaps that he was a Semi-Arian, of a nuance as yet undefined. 2. Testimony of Eusebius' Biography. Education, and more surely friendship, points to community of ideas and opinions. That is the principle presupposed here. Eusebius' early education in Edessa does not suggest anything parti cular, at least concerning his being an Arian. Maybe he left his native city before the Council of Nicea. At any rate, as far as we know from the records preserved, there is no evidence that at this time the system of Arius was known in Edessa. More likely Eusebius left his country shortly after the first General Council. In that case he knew, through his bishop Aitalaho, who subscribed to the symbol of Nicea and the condemnation of Arius' fundamental teachings,38 that the Arian system was unorthodox. In these circumstances it is strange indeed that he went, for his more formal education, straight to the Arian bishop of Scythopolis, Patrophilus, and to the Semi-Arian Eusebius of Cesarea, who did not subscribe wholeheartedly to the decisions of Nicea.37 But a disciple does not always strictly follow the line of his masters. What then about the subsequent facts in the life of Eusebius of Emesa ? First of all, we have no evidence that at any moment of his career he was in close contact with a strictly Nicene pcrsonalitj'. Perhaps he 33 Edit. cit. 54. 34 Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium, edit. P. G. 83 376—377. 35 For Theodoret, see ibid. 381—382; for Epiphanius, see Panarion edit. HOLL III 48—49 or edit. P.

G. 67 65—77.</page><page sequence="9">42 E. M. BUYTAERT was during the years he spent at Alexandria, but we possess no proof for it. Certainly he was at Antioch witnessing the deposition of Eusta thius, but it does not seem that he was there out of friendship for the luckless patriarch since he was a friend of Eustathius' Semi-Arian successors. On the other hand, there was no intimate relationship with pure Arians either. Under the direction of the Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, one unorthodox synod requested him to take the supposedly vacant see of Saint Athanasius of Alexandria. But Eusebius of Emesa did not show himself a forward candidate for this dubious honor. A short while later, when Eusebius was installed by the patriarch of An tioch as bishop of Emesa, the Arian bishop Narcissus of Neronias was there too, but exactly on that occasion our man was accused of being a Sabellianist, which suggests that the Emesenians, maybe under the influence of his refusing the bishopric at Alexandria, figured that he was pro-Nicene rather than Arian.38 His momentary candidacy for the Alexandrian see certainly had a bad influence on Eusebius' fame. However, his refusal and the silence of Saint Athanasius — who, in cidentally, strongly attacked and accused his actual substitutes — seem to point out that Eusebius was rather an unhappy victim of circum stances. We do not deny, however, that the synod of Antioch was con vinced that, at least, he was not pro-Nicene; otherwise his conditional election would make no sense whatever. During his later life, Eusebius' friends, it seems, were all Semi-Arians: Georges of Laodicea, his future biographer; Acacius of Cesarea, who formerly under Eusebius of Cesarea had been his condisciple; the Semi Arian bishops of Antioch between Eustathius and Leontius; maybe Macedonius of Beirut and the anti-Nicene though orthodox Cyril of Jerusalem, since both bishops allowed Eusebius of Emesa — or invited him? — to preach in their city;39 finally, the Semi-Arian emperor 38 For dating that accusation we follow here the version of SOCRATES, op. et edit. cit. 200; according to SOZOMEN (Church-history edit. P. G. 67 1048) Eusebius was accused of Sabellianism at the end of his career. If Sozomen is right, we have a new reason to believe that Eusebius followed the same line of evolution as his friends Georges of Laodicea and Acacius of Cesarea, namely that at the end of his life he came closer and closer to the doctrine of Nicea. 39 The history of the Beirut diocese in the Fourth Century is not clear at all. At any rate, one Macedonius of Beirut played an important role in the Semi-Arian synod of Antioch in 344. See MANSI, op. cit. II 1361—1368, and R. DEVREESSE, Le patriarcat d'Antioche depuis la paix de l'Eglise jusqu'à la conquête arabe (Paris 1945) 197. That this synod of Antioch was not a gathering of pure Arians is proven by the symbol it published : the funda mental teachings of Arius are condemned; see text in MANSI, op. cit. II 1364.</page><page sequence="10">Eusebius of Emesa 43 Constantius. Now, at least at the end of Eusebius' career, several of these persons, especially Georges and Acacius, not to speak again of Cyril, were certainly closer to the Nicean doctrine than to the pure Arian theories, though they did not adopt the Nicean terminology.40 Consequently, one can deduce from these biographical data that Eusebius was a Semi-Arian. But if he followed the same doctrinal evolution as his companions — and the constant friendship of Georges of Laodicea makes this theory acceptable — then it seems that, at least at the end of his life, he was a Semi-Arian of the extreme right, if not an anti-Nicene orthodox of the type of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem. If we now compare the conclusions reached here with the first point of our exposition, the testimony of antiquity, it would seem that we have to follow the opinion of Theodoret on Eusebius rather than that of Saint Jerome, or that in his Chronicon, Jerome was again using his "Arrianus" in one of its softer meanings. 3. Testimony gathered from some of Eusebius' writings. One fundamental difficulty for an historical analysis of Eusebius' doctrine on the Blessed Trinity is that the writings preserved do not contain enough chronological elements, to permit any dating of the works. There is only one real exception: the "Book" against Sabellius seems to be a panegyric of Eusebius of Emesa's master, Eusebius of Cesarea.41 Thus we know that this discourse was pronounced around 340 A. D., since the historian died in 339. The general lack of chronological indi cations makes it rather impossible, at the present at least, to prove the always possible evolution in the opinions of our author. The writings of Eusebius present still another difficulty, connected with the first : the author avoids making clear references to the persons he is attacking. We presume that for the hearers of his speeches his allusions were obvious enough, but that is not always so for the modern reader. The opuscules we are speaking about here deal only in part with the trinitarian problem. In a certain sense this is an advantage, because the 40 For Acacius of Cesarea, see e. g. J. LEBON, art. cit. 209, 372. 41 The text is published in P. G. 24 1059—1070; a new edition in La col lection de Troyes 105—127. For dating the panegyric, see E. M. BUYTAERT, L'Authenticité des dix-sept opuscules, loe. cit. 86—87. The De fide (edit, in La collection de Troyes 79—104) is composed after 335, probably later than 341 ; see L'Authenticité des dix-sept opuscules, loe. cit. 84. The opuscule from which Theodoret preserved two fragments in Greek (first complete edition of the discourse in La collection de Troyes 13—43) seems to have been written between 353 and 359; see L'Authenticité des dix-sept opuscules, loe. cit. 39—40.</page><page sequence="11">44 £■ M. BUYTAERT non-trinitarian discourses or passages composed without being in fluenced by the greatest struggle of the period allow us sometimes to grasp how Eusebius conceived some notions in the ordinary sense, notions used also in expounding his trinitarian doctrine. All the opuscules we propose to analyze are sermons or discourses, and it seems that most of them, if not all, were finally redacted by Eusebius himself or by somebody else, with the aid of short-hand notes taken in church or wherever the discourses were pronounced. One final observation before considering the contents of the writings : when a passage refers directly to Sabellius for instance, we are not per mitted to draw hasty conclusions, for instance on Eusebius' anti-Arian or anti-Nicene attitude. The context is always decisive in understanding and explaining the real value of a passage. With the same reserve we may use texts dealing with the Son's incarnation, or with our salvation or sanctification, since again and again they contain elements of Euse bius' concept of the Word. * First of all, it seems appropriate to make some observations on Euse bius' theological method. The latter has direct bearing on his trinitarian vocabulary and doctrine. The reader does not have to fear that we shall unduly apply our author's theological method to his doctrine on the Trinity, since most of the time Eusebius reports his methodological statements exactly when writing on that point so much debated during his lifetime. In short, Eusebius of Emesa's theology uses three great principles: the authority of the Bible, of the Church, and of common sense. But, since these criteria are quite common among theologians,42 the problem is, as it is for every theologian: what is the respective value of these principles in the system of Eusebius? We do not exaggerate in stating that Eusebius' writings contain primarily a biblical theology, supposing a rational or realistic method of interpreting Holy Scripture.43 The other theological principles appear " The Scholastics and in modern times the authors called 'speculative theologians' use Philosophy too. This Philosophy, even when it is called "philosophia perennis" is not always, salva reverentia, simply common sense. Eusebius of Emesa, in his extant writings, does not always show any parti cular interest in Philosophy; neither does Saint Athanasius at that time. It does not seem that Eusebius' philosophical studies in Alexandria, attested to by the sources, had any influence on his Theology. 43 From the exegetical viewpoint our Eusebius seems to be at the beginn ing of a famous lineage: Theodore of Mopsuestia, Diodore of Tarsus, Saint John Chrysostom.</page><page sequence="12">Eusebius of Emesa 45 only occasionally, and then usually either as a means of under standing the Bible, or as confirming what is already known through Scripture.44 Before anything else, in the opinion of Eusebius, the Christian has to consult the Bible, which tells us what we have to admit and what we have to reject, what problems we are able to solve — accepting the solution given by the Bible — and what questions are insoluble for us. By "Holy Scripture" the author understands both the Old and the New Testament: there are texts in his discourses attacking the concept of Marcion that the New Testament is to be separated from the Old Testament. The biblical books have authority since they are the work of Moses the Prophets, Saint John, Saint Paul, or because they contain the testimony of Saint Peter, for instance. These men are our criteria of truth, since they received their doctrine from the Holy Ghost, from Christ or from the Father himself. For example, Saint John received his doctrine on the Logos from Jesus, when during the Last Supper the Apostle rested his head upon Jesus' bosom. And Saint Peter was a good witness for the divinity of Christ, since upon the mountain of the trans figuration he heard the Father saying: "This is my beloved Son .. Speaking about God, the Holy Ghost knows what he says, since he re ceives his knowledge from the Son, and the Son himself testifies that he alone knows the Father; the authority of the Father is unquestionable : if the Truth were lying, where is truth to be found? All this is quite right. But the trouble was — and Eusebius knew it — that in the preceding history and even in our author's own days different systems were proposed which were unacceptable to the Church, and nevertheless used evidence taken from the Bible. Therefore Eusebius had to explain how we are to understand the Sacred Books. 44 Such scholars as B. ALTANER (op. cit. 201) and O. BARDENHEWER (Geschichte der altkirchlichen Literatur, III, 2d edit., Freiburg 1923, 263) simply list Eusebius of Emesa under the rubric "Disciples and imitators of Eusebius of Cesarea". We believe that they are over-simplifying matters. Eusebius of Emesa studied under the direction of the great historian, that much is certain. But how long ? And how strong was the influence of the master. In describing the theological principles of our author we already see that the disciple does not slavishly follow the master, Eusebius of Cesarea. Church history and symbolic biblical exegesis play a minor part in the Theo logy of Eusebias of Emesa.</page><page sequence="13">46 E. M. BUYTAERT One principle of Eusebius' biblical exegesis is that we have to accept everything that is in the Scriptures, and that we are not allowed to reject anything written in them. This principle, according to the context, is clearly directed against Sabellius, or better, to avoid mistakes in our interpretation, against all those who admit that "Father" and "Son" are but different names for what in fact is completely identical. Such a theory, according to Eusebius, does not accept the texts "and God had the World abidingwith him", "there was a voice which said to them out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son", "I will ask the Father", etc., which undoubtedly suppose some kind of distinction between the Father and the Son. Although immediately directed against Sabellius or kindred spirits, this principle, if we consider the historical ambience and the rest of Eusebius' doctrine, may contain some point against both Arius and Nicea. Against Arius, since this man does not accept what according to Eusebius is clearly expressed by the Bible, that the Word is God. Against Nicea, since the Council effaced from the symbol pro posed by Eusebius of Cesarea the biblical expressions "the Word" and "primogenitus omnis creaturae", expressions abused by Arius and his supporters. Another principle, connected with the preceding, is that we have to be satisfied with what the Bible tells us. No additions are allowed. This principle is particularly applied to the doctrine on the Blessed Trinity. Among the reasons currently given by Eusebius for this appli cation, are two biblical passages: "Whose birth is beyond our knowing", taken from the Deutero-Isaias; and this text from Saint John: "None knows the Son except the Father, and none knows the Father except the Son". In the opinion of Eusebius apparently the terms of the Nicene creed "consubstantial" and "from the substance of the Father" are among the unjustified additions. As a matter of fact, Eusebius never as much as pronounces or writes the word "consubstantial", not even to discuss its validity or opportuneness; but, where a pro-Nicene author would have used "from the substance of the Father", he simply repeats after Eusebius of Cesarea "from the Father". On the other hand, Eusebius of Emesa follows what sometimes is called "the rationalistic method (of the Antiochene theologians) of interpreting Holy Scripture". He maintains that we have to look for a common sense interpretation, without dispute, not adding our personal ideas, but considering and analyzing what we now call 'text and context' and recalling what other passages of the Bible say about the same pro blem. For him, an exegesis not taking into account the true nature</page><page sequence="14">Eusebius of Emesa 47 of the text and the parallel passages is a "dry" interpretation, and in admissible. One of Eusebius' own applications is this: if a biblical expression is symbolic or, speaking about God, anthropomorphic, we have to find out, if possible, what is the reality covered by the symbol. Thus, in one of his discourses on the spirituality of God, he makes or quotes numerous objections against anthropomorphic expressions, difficulties taken especially from the Old Testament, such as "the mouth of God", "the voice of God", God's hand", God's feet", and the like. About the divine generation he says that it surely is not a generation like that of created beings. Eusebius' sensible principles make it re latively easy to get around this type of difficulty created by biblical symbolism. If a biblical analogy is rightly understood, Eusebius does not fear to use it. He even develops it. The biblical term "Filius" introduces "nasci, gignere, generare, progenies, progeneratio". But as soon as an analogy, even a biblical one, appears to be dangerous, because some authors abuse it, Eusebius does not fear to reject it. What we said in this paragraph proves that Eusebius' principle of "no additions" to the Bible and "no deletions" are understood with moderation. In this context we have to recall the other criterion of Eusebius' theology: the teachings of the Church. What are these teachings? Eusebius does not say it very clearly. Anyhow, according to him, they are not necessarily those of the Council of Nicea.45 In other words he does not consider the decisions of the Council as decisions of the uni versal Church. He rather refers to "the faith of the confessors, the one for which the martyrs died", that is, the doctrines generally accepted before the era of Constantine. This fact and Eusebius' fundamental aversion for disputes, explains the total absence of such terms as "con substantial", Ô7rô&lt;TT«(nç, oÙctlx and the like. The third fundamental principle of Eusebius is common sense, requiring avoidance of fancy interpretation of the Bible and the teachings of the Church, as implied before. * A detailed analysis of Eusebius' doctrine based upon his writings would be in order right here, but it will be published later. We can now only summarize briefly what we found up to the present. Eusebius of 45 This attitude of Eusebius will surprise only those who, for aprioristic reasons, believe that the Church between 325 and 360 already had our clear-cut doctrine on the authority of a general council.</page><page sequence="15">48 E. M. BUYTAERT Emesa keeps silence about Nicea, but strongly attacks pure Arianisin. He uses the Homoian terminology, but „quoad sensum" he belongs to the right wing of the so-called Third Party. This as yet unpublished analysis, consequently, will confirm the conclusion reached in considering the life of our author. Erigius M. Buytaert, O. F. M. Franciscan Institute</page></plain_text>
