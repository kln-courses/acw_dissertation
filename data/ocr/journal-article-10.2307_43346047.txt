ISBN 0-521- 44539-6 The attitude to personification has largely been negative in the 20th century, and many critics have dismissed it as an antiquated poetic figure. On the other hand, C.S. Lewis in The Allegory of Love1 has expressed the belief that personification is an essential way of thinking for humanity. Only a few twentieth-century writers have still believed like Lewis in the power of personification as a trope or have actually endeavoured to rehabilitate it. In 1947, Bertrand H. Bronson undertook to rescue eighteenth-century personification from the disrepute into which it had fallen largely as a result of Romantic and post-Romantic criticism. Earl R. Wasserman continued Bronson's line, revealing eighteenth-century enthusiasm for personified abstractions. The rehabilitation was completed by Chester F. Chapin, who supplemented a survey of theoretical attitudes towards the figure with a history of its poetic practice2. Others have followed, but probably the only person to attempt a complete taxonomy of personification and its related tropes is James Paxson in his doctoral dissertation in 1989, which has now matured into a book entitled The Poetics of Personifi- cation. Paxson states his aim as "to extend and enrich the current theoretical rehabilitation of personification"3 by carefully investigating its formal nature. The first chapter isolates the theoretical problem in terms of a historical survey of ideas about personification, while the second chapter reassesses the conventional terminology associated with the trope. Paxson relates the figure to the sign as it is understood by structuralists, so that the signifier/personifier is the material or linguistic agent by which the signified/personified is given expression4. This idea is relevant to Paxson's interest in the importance of personification in narrative. The various figurai translations - as they are called - are listed on pp. 42^3, where the author presents the related tropes, of which personification is only one. Translations occur between the ontological categories or domains of: human, non-human life form (plant or animal), inanimate object, place, abstract idea, and deity. These translations are given appropriate names, so that when for instance a person is translated into an inanimate object, we speak of reification. Here one would expect to find a complete system which could be used to define and check on occurrences of the various tropes in poetry, but, presumably since the possible combinations are too numerous, Paxson mentions only a few by way of example and leaves the rest to his reader to fill in. It is probably true that listing all possible combinations of translations between six categories would have been out of the question, but at least a few more concrete examples would have been welcome in this context. It is to be particularly noted that the element undergoing ontological translation can, in theory at least, be a member of any of the six ontological categories, but Paxson's list below mentions only a few categories to the left of the arrow; also that at least one trope, that of a translation into a deity, lacks a name (I have suggested elsewhere5 the term 'divinification'). The list of tropes includes: - substantialization ( materialization , hypostasization): non-corporeal quantity =&gt; physi- cal, corporeal one - anthropomorphism: non-human quantity =&gt; character with human form</page><page sequence="2">498 BESPRECHUNGEN - personification: non-human quantity =&gt; sentient human being capable of thought and language, possessing voice and face - animification: human agent, abstraction, inanimate object =&gt; animal - reification : human agent =&gt; inanimate object - ideation: thing or human agent =&gt; abstract idea, essence, spirit, rarefied form - topification: abstraction =&gt; geographical locus. The first three are said to break down into subsets, but it is not fully clear whether the four other tropes are meant to represent these subsets or whether they, or some of them, are independent tropes. Altogether, this part of the book - in some ways its culmination - does not explain sufficiently clearly the interrelations of the tropes, and many of the definitions are either sketchy or missing altogether. This list has been brought over almost intact from Paxson's doctoral dissertation, and I feel it could have been improved on. I have found that by and large the tropes are applicable in an analysis of poetry, but also that some more categories are needed, or that the existing ones need to be re-defined. A case in point is Robert Burns's poem The Holy Tulzie 6 11. 29-30, in which the poet likens the Calvinist doctrine to a fountain-head. This translation - abstract idea into concrete object - is not mentioned by Paxson, but it could well be included in reification (the translation of a human agent into an inanimate being7). (I am not concerned here with the possibility that the image could be treated as a simple metaphorical expression.) Paxson's detailed discussion of ontological translations in Piers Plowman and The Faerie Queene (Chapters 5 and 6) offers a good analysis from a narcological point of view and can be recommended to anyone interested either in these works or in the theory of narrativity. One important aspect is the question of naming as a way of establishing personification figures, discussed by Paxson in Chapter 2, but more specifically in his analysis of Piers. The discussion of literary dreams as discreet narrative levels in Chapter 5 is also highly interesting. To conclude: The usefulness of Paxson's dissertation to anyone interested in personification lies less in the relevance of his material (except for a mediaevalist) than in his scientific approach to the question of what is personification and what are its related tropes. He does not shy away from such fundamental issues as the definition of abstract vs. concrete - a question which, amazingly, does not interest many scholars who have nevertheless attempted to define this figure. Paxson's work is a very welcome contribution to the theory of personification, but he has only indicated the existence of a complete and coherent framework of the trope: his ideas are not a tool waiting to be applied to poetry analysis. Paxson's main interest lies in developing the theory of personification and its related tropes and applying it to the narrative, and will therefore be most useful in a study of narrative poetry as well as further theoretical discussions. A student of mediaeval poetry will naturally find Paxson's material more relevant than someone interested in later centuries. Most importantly perhaps, Paxson has realized the significance of ontological transla- tions other than personification, a facet of the problem which has been largely, if not totally, ignored by other literary scholars.
