The view that it developed out of the fun-making scenes in the religious plays, where they were in reality foreign matter and could, therefore, be easily detached and acted separately, has been discarded by modern historians of the drama. The Fastnachtsspiel or Carni val play, the form in which the secular drama appears in Ger many towards the close of the Middle Ages, is but the natural outgrowth of the Carnival customs themselves.1 The drama, among all peoples, originated in the magical rites of heathen wor ship.2 It can scarcely be doubted that the ceremonies of the old heathen religion were essentially dramatic.3 Neither can the fact be questioned that Greek comedy sprang up and took shape in connection with Dionysiac ritual.4 We may rightly assume, therefore, that the practices of the Germanic cult also had some embryonic dramatic tendencies. As a matter of fact, the Germanic peoples, in the usages of their religion, had a better opportunity for spontaneous acting than the Greeks in their Dionysia.5 Love of the drama, indeed, seems always to have been 1 Cf.

The reason, however, why their religious practices did not develop like the Dionysiac rites is not due to an inherent fault, but to an external cause. The Church hampered the dramatic evolution of the Germanic folk-customs by its intervention with a more complicated drama based on its own ritual and imported from the East.6 But while there is general agreement in regard to the pagan descent of the Carnival comedy, there is great diversity of opinion concerning the particular ceremonies in which it might have originated. It will be the object of this essay to inquire into the ritual origins of the Carnival comedy. A discussion of the origin and nature of the Carnival must naturally precede our inquiry. II. The Origin of Carnival The Carnival, be it understood, is, notwithstanding its present connection with a Christian observance, of pagan origin. In its original form it was a heathen agricultural festival, and, like all feasts and festivals in the pastoral and agricultural days of the Irano-European peoples, was originally connected with a change in Nature. However, it had no relation to the winter solstice, as is generally assumed. The Germano-Keltic tribes had no solstitial festival, for they knew nothing of solstices.7 In its origin the Carnival was a ploughing and sowing festival,8 and formed a part of the public cult of the fertilization spirit. The Church did not institute it, but adopted it from the heathen ritual and changed it into a Christian observance as was done with many other indigenous festivals surviving in all essentials beneath a new faith which was but skin deep.9 Room was found all the more readily for this festival in the scheme of the Church, for it offered the converts an opportunity to recompense them selves for the forty days of abstinence, which were ahead of them. Moreover, the connection between Carnival and Lent may also go back to pre-Christian days. Lent, perhaps, may 8 Cf. J. S. Tunison, Dramatic Traditions of the Dark Ages (1907), p. 307. 7 Cf. Chambers, op. cit., i. 228. 8 Cf. J. H.

Frazer, op. cit., v. 308.</page><page sequence="3">404 Rudwin have been derived from an old pagan period of abstinence intended to promote the growth of the seed,10 and the Church converted this pagan custom, too, into a Christian solemnity now so rigidly observed as commemorative of the fast of Jesus in the wilderness. The English Lent as the equivalent of the German Lenz is a synonym of spring. The English name for Carnival, it may be argued, points to a Christian origin of this festival. Shrovetide as an appellation for the period in which it was customary to shrive, to confess, as a preparation for the forty days' fast, is, of course, an eccle siastical term. This argument may be supported, indeed, by the fact that in the German language this festival is known as Fastnacht, which at first sight cannot mean anything else but the eve of the fast, in accordance with the Teutonic practice of com mencing the day with the evening. In some Rhine districts the term Fastelovend is locally used, Ovend being a vernacular form of Abend (evening). However, the fact of the matter is that the word Fastnacht is a popular corruption of Fass nacht (vasnacht), as this festival still is colloquially called. Perfectly correct, however, is the form Fasenacht (MHG. vasenaht)11, by which the Carnival season was universally known in Germany up to quite recent times. The verb of the first component of this word is not taken from fasten?to fast?but from j'asen (dialectical faseln), to talk nonsense, to have great fun. Fasenacht would thus denote an evening of feasting and fooling.12 The popular interpretation of Fassnacht in medieval times seems to have been the evening of carousing, of diligent application to the F ass (cask). Hans Sachs symbolizes F ass nacht as a kind of beast of the Apocalypse. He describes the symbolical figure of the licentious festival as a "grosses Tier, dess Bauch ist wie ein f?drig F ass, und es hat ein weiten Schlund." 10 Cf. Frazer, op. cit., ix. 317sqq. 11 The form Fasching, which is still currently common especially in Bavaria and Austria, is derived from MHG. vaschanc, a variant of vasenaht. 12 Cf. Wilh. Wackernagel, Geschichte d. deutsch. Literatur (1848), p. 314nl; Kleinere Schriften ii. (1873) 107. The old derivation of Fastnacht from fasten is found in Adelung, W?rterb. ii. 56 and Grimm, Dt. W?rterb. iii. 1353^. G. Schindler, Bayr, W?rterb. (Fromann ed. 1872), pp. 763sqq., points to the form vasnacht as found in old documents. [See, however, H. Hirt in Weigand's Deutsches W?rterbuch6 under Fastnacht. Ed.]</page><page sequence="4">The Origin of the German Carnival Comedy 405 The name Carnival now prevailing in the regions which were for a longer time under Roman domination, viz., Italy, France, and the Rhenish provinces of Germany, has likewise been interpreted as indicative of the Christian origin of the festival. It has been generally derived from the Latin carnem levare (Ital. came levare), the putting away or removal of flesh as food, or, what is still more Carnevalesque, from the Italian cama vale, i.e., flesh, farewell! However, the correct derivation of the word Carnival is from the Latin carrus navalis (Ital. camevale or camovale, French, Spanish and Portuguese carneval or camavel), the ship-cart, which formed the centre of the festal proces sions in many parts of Europe and Western Asia.13 III. The Ship-Procession The central fact of this festival, as of all agricultural fes tivals, was the presence, in the village, of the deity in the form of a ship. This observance originated in the natural or magical stage of belief and was based upon the notion of what Frazer calls "sympathetic magic."14 The ship was led in solemn procession about the fields and around the boundaries of the village in order to spread the influence of its benign presence over the whole community.15 This custom was not limited to certain maritime districts, nor was it a result of the fact that the goddess of fertility in the course of history also took over the charge of sea-faring, as Chambers believes.16 A ship was dedicated annually to Isis, the Egyptian goddess of 13 Hermann M?ller, Das nordische Griechentum und die urgeschichtl.

The view held by Mannhardt that the ship-procession was a rain-charm18 can no longer be seriously entertained. The ship was the symbol of femininity in creation among all the primitive races.19 However, although it was first sacred to the fertility goddess only, it later became the emblem of the fertility god as well. The ship of Ea was after awhile extended to all the great gods of Babylonia. The ship of Isis in the course of time accomodated all other gods of Egypt, and these gods, according to Porphyry20 were also represented in boats. The ship notably became the vehicle of the sun gods in analogy to the "lunar boat" of the moon goddesses, as the cresecent was called by the ancients. Ra, the sun-god of the Egyptians, was represented as sailing across the heavens in a ship.21 The planeteary gods of Greece were always represented in boats. Helios sails in a golden boat as much as he races in a four-horse chariot. The ark or the cup was a modified form of the ship.22 The ark of Jahveh was originally a ship, the ship of Ea. The Israelites adopted it from the Assyrians, who in turn took it from the Babylonians. If the religion of Israel was related to the solar monotheism of Egypt,23 the ark of Jahveh may have been modelled after the ship of Ra. The appellation "Ark of the Covenant" is a later substitution for the earlier name of the "Ark of Jahveh." That the ark was virtually 17 Cf. H. Usener, op. cit., p. 130. 18 Cf. W. Mannhardt, Wdd=u.

The Carnival can be traced back historically to the cult of Isis. This goddess figured prominently among the Egyptian and other Oriental deities, which were brought to Greece. At first the Greeks were fain to recognize in her their earth goddess Demeter, but soon they also came to see in her the sea-goddess and dedicated to her, also, a ship on the annual reopening of navigation. The ship-procession, as has already been noted,26 was not altogether a foreign importation to Greece. It wras observed in Athens long before Isis was known in the Greek lands.26 A ship formed an essential part of the Dionysiac cult. A representation of the epiphany of Dionysus in a ship was seen by Loeschcke on a black-figured amphora of Greek provenience from the end of the seventh century at Corneto.27 A carrus navalis undoubtedly formed the central feature of the Dionysian festal procession in Athens. An Attic vase of the sixth century now at Bologna represents the god Dionysus in a ship set on wheels and drawn by Sil?nes.28 From Greece the worship of Isis penetrated to Rome and Italy. We do not know when the Egyptian goddess arrived there, but we learn that during the closing years of the Roman period, a festival called Navigium Isidis in honor of the Egyp tian Isis was held on March 5, in which a ship-car (carrus navalis) dedicated to the goddess was led in solemn procession.2* The fact that the Carnival of modern Italy and the Navigium Isidis of ancient Rome occur at about the same time confirms 24 Cf. I. Sam. vi. 3 and II. Sam. vi. 14. On the question whether or no Jhvh was present in or on the ark see Karl Budde, "War die Lade Jahwes ein leerer Thron?" Theol. Studien u.

But it must be admitted that the Carnival also shows a remarkable resemblance to the Saturnalia,30 the similarity of which to the folk-festivals of Western Europe is in fact greater than would appear at first. A naval procession was probably also observed in ancient Rome during the Saturnalia prior to the arrival of the goddess Isis. Saturnus, the Assyrian god Baal or Bel, is said to have come up the Tiber into the region of Rome to visit Janus in a ship.31 The name Saturnus, moreover, seems to point to a ploughing and sewing festival,32 although how such a festival came to be held in mid-winter (December 17) must be a matter of conjecture.33 Popular usage, however, extended this festival by degrees until it finally fell in the ploughing season. The Carnival amuse ments in Venice reach back to December 26. The connection of the Roman Saturnalia with the Kelto-Germanic ploughing feast, if such a connection did exist, must have been of great importance for the dramatic evolution of its ritual. Traces of the Saturnalia may be seen in our celebration of Christmas. The modern Italian Carnival may also show some features of the celebration of the resurrection of Attis on March 25, which took the form of a Carnival at Rome and probably elsewhere.34 This day is now celebrated as the Feast of Anunciation. The festival in the form it had acquired in Greece and Rome was carried across the Alps by the Romans, and became merged with a Kelto-Germanic festival of a similar character, though developed in a different way.35 This theory will account for the fact that while in the Rhineland, as in Gaul, the Carnival has distinctly Roman features, the native Carnival customs are retained in their ancient character in other parts of Ger 30 Frazer, op. cit., ix. 312, is of the opinion that the Saturnalia of ancient Rome and the Carnival of modern Italy are identical.

Moreover, there seems to have been a uniformity of religious practices "not only among the Teutonic and Keltic tribes, who inhabited western and northwestern Europe and the British Islands, but also amongst all the Aryan-speaking peoples."37 The ship-procession was also a part of the Germanic worship and a long established custom among all the German tribes. The ship was the symbol of a number of Teutonic goddesses.38 Tacitus records that the Suevi dedicated, in the first century of our era, a ship to their goddess, whom he identifies as Isis.39 The name is, of course, his interpretatio Romana of a Germanic goddess, probably Nehellenia. He calls her Isis as he calls Wootan Mercury and Thor Mars.40 This goddess of fruition appears to have been worshipped by a ship-procession in the Netherlands and Germany.41 Her name is probably derived from Semit. nohal, nihal, to flow or to float, just as is that of St. Nicholas, who is the patron of the mariners. Among the Batavians and Frisians this goddess appears to have been pos sessed with many attributes of Isis, among which is also the ship.42 She is also called Pelagia, and often supports her left foot or both feet on the keel of a ship.43 Aix-la-Chapelle proba bly was the chief centre of her worship. Her old picture is still preserved in the minster of that town.44 The ship-procession was probably also a part of the worship of Nerthus.46 Tacitus46 also speaks of the procession in a "vekiculum" of the image of Nerthus, the Earth-Mother, *Ibid. n Cf. Chambers, op. cit., i. 100. nCf. Simrock, op. cit., p. 390. Mannhardt, op. cit., i. 559n2, rejects this view; cf. also Sepp, op. cit., p. 54. * Germania, 9. 40 Cf. S.

This vehiculum of Nerthus, who, as will be shown forthwith, probably is identical with the goddess Tacitus found worshipped by the Suevi in a ship procession, was a ship-cart, a terrae navis, as was the ship of Isis, which travelled on land and water,47 and also the skidbladnir, the ship of Freyr, which sailed in the air and on the water. The theory that the vehiculum of Nerthus was a ship-cart finds further support in the fact that the procession set out from her sacred grove in an island of the ocean.48 The procession of Nerthus is doubtless identical with the posession of Freyr,49 whose life-size statue was drawn about the country in a ship waggon when the winter was at an end.50 In this procession the god was attended by a beautiful girl called his wife, Freya,51 while in the Nerthus procession recorded by Tacitus, the god dess, present in her ship,52 probably was accompanied by her husband in the form of an image. There is no doubt that Nerthus is the same as Freya, the Teutonic wood-goddess.53 As Freya she is the female counterpart of Freyr, as Nerthus, of Freyr's northern double, Nj?rdr. Nerthus-Freya, moreover, is identical with Wanne Thekla, who also comes and goes in her ship.54 She may perhaps also be the same as Nehellenia.55 In popular legend and lore Freya is known in Lower Germany as Holda (Huida), Frau Holl (Holle), and in the Upper German regions, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria, and in Austria as Hertha, Bertha or Perchta.56 The Germanic Freya 47 Cf.

In medieval German witch-lore this goddess is known as Diana. In popular belief she is succeeded by the Virgin Mary, to whom she has also bequeathed her ship. A number of images of the Holy Virgin on ships are found in Belgium.68 But the Virgin Mary did not find it an easy task to replace the heathen goddess in the hearts of the old Germans. A few centuries of Christianity did not suffice to make them forget their beloved Bona Dea. They continued to worship her down to the twelfth century according to Rudolfus, a monk from the Abbey of St. Trond, in his account of a Carnival festival in the district of Jiilich, in Lower Germany.59 We learn from his detailed report that about the year 1133, in a forest near Inda (in Ripuaria), a ship was built, set upon wheels, and drawn by men, who were yoked to it, about the country, first to Aix-la-Chappelle, then to Maestricht, where mast and sail were added, and up the river to Tongres, Looz, and so on, everywhere with crowds of people assembling and escorting it. Wherever it halted, there were joyful shouts, songs of triumph and dancing round the ship kept up till far into the night. The approach of the ship was made known in advance to the towns; the people opened the gates and went out to meet it. J. Grimm rightly identifies this ship travelling about the country, wel comed by streaming multitudes and honored with festive song and dance, as the car of the goddess whom Tacitus took to be Isis. "How could this pauper rusticus, he asks, "in the wood of Inden have lighted on the thought of building a ship, had there not been floating in his mind recollections of former pro cessions, perhaps of some of his neighboring districts?" Ship-processions at the beginning of spring were continued in various parts of Germany to the end of the Middle Ages.60 The custom of drawing a plough, the central instrument of the opening labor, as an emblem of the agricultural spirit, in the 88 Cf.

In Ulm, in case of snow, the ship is placed on a sleigh.67 A ship-cart was drawn in the Nuremberg procession of maskers ("Schembartlauf") from 1475 on,68 and the analogous Perchtenlauf in the Alpine districts very probably also contained a ship in honor of the goddess Berchta. A curious type of a ship-procession was observed in Oldenburg down to recent times on Whitsunday. Small ships were placed the preceding evening on a waggon, which was drawn the next day through the streets of the town.69 The ship-cart, in Keltic and Teutonic countries as well as in Greece and Rome, was not always a vacant throne. It con tained, as a rule, an image or some other emblem of divinity.70 When its original symbolism was forgotten, the ship represented the most proper place in which a god could dwell in the midst of his people. We have seen that Dionysus paraded in his ship through the streets of Athens.71 The ship-car in the Nuremberg 61 Cf. Chambers, op. cit., i. 118. 62 Cf. J.

The goddess Perchta very probably was visibly represented in her ship72, which, as we surmised, formed a part of the analogous Perchtenlauf. The fertility god on his progress through the streets and market-places of the town did not even stop short at the portals of the Church. There is a record in the sixteenth century of an instance of the combination of the Carnival ship-procession with the Church ass-procession on Palm Sunday. Thomas Naogeorgus relates that the image of the fertility god was placed on a wooden ass, which had been mounted on a platform with wheels, and drawn into the church on Palm Sunday in procession, the priests going before.73 The reforming ecclesiastics violently declaimed against this Carnival custom. They referred to the ship as malignorum spirituum execrabile domicilium (the accursed habitation of evil spirits), and declared that maligni Spiritus (evil spirits) travelled in it.74 Small wonder that the ship-cart in the Nuremberg Schembartlauf was called H?lle and that it was burned together with its occupants at the end of the procession. IV. The Mythical Drama The Carnival customs of Europe also contained a sort of mythical drama, which was composed of a number of rites of the kind which Frazer has termed "mimetic magic."75 This class of charms is based on the principle of similarity, which holds that a thing can be influenced through what is similar to it. It presupposes the belief that "between the imitative rite and the natural event it is intended to cause there is the bond of sympathetic mimesis, consisting in the actual likeness of the act ritually performed to the desired event."76 As the fluctuations of growth and decay, of reproduction and dissolution were 72 Cf.

Aeschylus and Shelley alike speak of the mar riage of the heaven and the earth. A ceremony of a similar nature is the marriage of the sun and the moon, and of the spirits of vegetation conceived as male and female, as gods and goddesses, which was enacted in the European spring ritual in order to bring about the impregnation of nature.78 The marriages of the ancient deities of vegetation, Adonis or Tammuz with Aphrodite or Ishtar, Zeus with Leto, Jupiter with Apia, Saturn with Ops, and Freyr with Freya, had for their object the fertility of field, fold, and family.79 Modern survivals of these customs may be seen in the mock marriages of leaf-clad mummers in Western Europe.80 We have the May-pairs, King and Queen, Lord and Lady of the May, representatives of the spirits of vegetation, united in a nominal troth.81 Often the marriage, though not directly represented, is implied by naming only the human representative of the spirit, the bride, and dressing her in wedding attire.82 The mock marriages of modern times answer in form and meaning to the magical marriages, the sacred unions of the gods and goddesses, of ancient days.83 There is. however, this difference, as Frazer points out, that in those days the ceremonies had not yet dwindled into mere shows and pageants, but were still religious or magical rites in which the actors consciously supported the high parts of gods and goddesses.84 77 Cf.

It was performed as a kind of passion-play in all parts of Europe as well as in certain parts of Asia. The death and resurrection of Adonis, Attis, and Osiris were annually performed in their rites in Western Asia and in Greek lands.85 The passion and resurrec tion of Dionysus were performed at several of his rites and perhaps also at the Anthesteria.86 The modern Thracian Carnival drama still represents the marriage, death and resur rection of Dionysus.87 The myth of Balder, who was slain like Dionysus and Orpheus, was perhaps also performed in his rites.88 Analogous practices are found in India, Australia, and Mexico. This idea of the dying and reviving god, by which primitive man explained the decay and growth of vegetation, has been kept smouldering beneath the ashes of the centuries. It under lies many rural spring customs of modern Europe and is still expressed in a number of varieties of dramatic symbolism.S9 The mock-killing of the leaf-clad mummer, the representative of the old spirit whose powers have failed in the decay of winter, as a necessary step to his revival or resurrection or re-birth in a younger and fresher form, is still a prominent feature of our folk-festivals. It has survived in certain parts of Germany and Austria as a Shrovetide and Whitsuntide custom.90 Often the leaf-clad person, who as the representative of the old spirit of vegetation is about to be executed, is known as the king. There is also, as has been noted, a king and queen of May. The royal title implies that the spirit incorporated in vegetation is a ruler.91 It may, however, with great likelihood, be traced back to the influence of the Saturnalia, at which a mock king after a reign of thirty days was sacrificed to Cronos. This custom has perhaps played a part in the mock crowning of Jesus by the Roman soldiers before his crucifixion. 86 Ibid., v. 224sqq., vi.

The view that in these spring customs Death meant originally the dying or dead vegetation of winter has the high support of Mannhardt. However, when the original meaning of these ceremonies was lost, the good but old god of vegetation, who had to be slain in order that he might rise again in renewed youth and vigor, was transformed into an evil spirit of Death, on whom were laid all the evils that had befallen the people during the past year, as was also the custom of the Jews in their treatment of their bibli cal scapegoat. The custom of carrying out the dead vegetation widened out in this manner into banning or banishing death in general from the village or district. The ceremony of banishing, burying, or burning of Death is found in various parts of Teutonic Germany, but especially in districts such as Thuringia, Bohemia, Silesia where the popu lation is wholly or mainly Slavonic.95 The date of the obser vance is not uniformly fixed. The ceremony takes place on March l,96 on the first Sunday,97 the third Sunday,98 the fourth Sunday (Mid-Lent)99 the fifth Sunday in Lent,100 the first Sunday after Easter,101 and on Ascension Day.102 92 Cf.

The leaf-clad mummer is often called Shrovetide Bear107 or Carnival Fool.108 When the original meaning of the ceremony was lost and the effigy was supposed to embody and to be responsible for all the excesses committed during the Carnival,109 its execution was transferred to Ash Wednesday, and the ceremony was known as the burning of the Carnival Fool.110 In analogy to Carnival, Lent, then, also obtained personification.111 The effigy of Death is also known as Old Woman,112 and that of Winter as Mrs. Winter or Ugly Woman,113 or Winter's Grandmother, i.e., Old Woman or Witch.114 In its simplest form the effigy of Death, Winter or Carnival was carried or carted out of the village,115 or thrown over the boundary of the next village.116 But it was also thrown into the water, beheaded, hanged, burned, not uncommonly, in the 105 Ibid., iv. 247, 260., ix. 4045?., x. 120. 104 Ibid., iv. 209, 221, 226, 22Ssqq., x. 120. 105 Ibid., iv. 208-9, 222, 224-33. 106 Ibid., iv. 252sq., xi. 21sqq.; Chambers, op. cit., i. 186. 107 Cf.

The burning may have been intended to secure, by means of mimetic magic, a supply of sunshine for the crops,118 but it may also have been carried out for purificatory purposes.119 The effigy of the fertility god was perhaps buried as a guarantee of resurrection. The fact that it was very commonly buried under straw or dung would point to its fertilizing power on the new vernal life.120 The drowning of the effigy of the spirit of vegetation may in a like manner have had for its purpose the securing, by means of mimetic magic, of a supply of rain to make the fields and mea dows green in the summer.121 Images of Adonis were also thrown into the sea or into springs.122 The ship as a symbol of the fertility spirit was in early times led at the end of the proces sion to a nearby river, stream, or sea, and surrendered to the water, a fact which led Mannhardt to believe that the ship procession was a rain-charm.123 The water-journey of the goddess Nerthus was, in the opinion of Chambers, a rain charm,124 but according to our conjecture it was rather a wed ding-trip.ia5 We may perhaps look at the sea-voyage of the god or goddess as the ship-burial of the dead spirit of vegetation.126 Balder's body was sent in a ship' out into the sea.127 In the Egyptian Book of the Dead a ship is figured carrying the souls to the other world. Ship-burials were also common among the ancient Germans.

When the dead fertility god was later misconceived to be an evil spirit, the belief may have gained ground that the ship carried the evil spirits out upon the unfruitful ocean.130 Evils are expelled on rafts or in a ship in modern folk-survivals and in savage customs.131 As a result of this misinterpretation of Death we have as a part of the annual Carnival ceremonies an expulsion of demons and witches, death and disease, plague and pain, fire and famine.132 This custom was commonly observed among the heathen of Europe,133 and was not unknown among the ancient Germans.134 The demons at their expulsion were either embod ied in effigies,135 or spersonified by men,136 while witches were always burned in effigy. Torches were used in the expulsion of demons and witches.137 A variant of this ceremony is the custom of burning of effigies in bon-fires. The giants of wicker-work burned in bon-fires at Carnival and other popular festivals138 are believed by Mannhardt to have been originally representa tives of vegetation spirits and later degraded into demons.139 The great season for fire-festivals in Europe is the summer solstice, Midsummer Eve or Midsummer Day.140 Midsummer fires are found all over Europe and especially in German lands.141 The custom of burning effigies in Midsummer fires is still observed in some parts of Europe.142 The Yule log, the Mid 129 "Der d?monische Ursprung d. griechischen Dramas,".

The expulsion of witches is a common custom in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.146 The Banning or Burning of Witches took place generally on Walpurgis Night,147 May day,148 at Midsummer,149 but also on the first Sunday in Lent,150 which would prove that the custom originally formed a part of the Carnival observances. We have already seen151 that the effigy of Death or Winter was sometimes called Old Woman or Witch. The effigies of witches were burned, as a rule, in bon-fires.152 The ceremony of bon-fires is, therefore, sometimes called "burning the witches."153 The Beltane fires in Austria and Saxony were lighted for the purpose of burning the witches.154 A Christian version of this ceremony is the banning or burning of Judas Iscariot, which naturally takes place at Easter.155 In a certain part of Silesia it is observed on Wednes day before Good Friday.156 Judas is burned in Easter-fires in Bavaria, Upper Franken and Bohemia.167 In England the Jack-o'-Lent effigy is taken to represent Judas.158 The Easter fire ceremony is, therefore, sometimes called "burning Judas."

An effigy of Martin Luther was burned at Midsummer in certain Catholic parts of Germany down to the year 1807 or 1808.160 The identification of the effigy with Luther was, as Frazer rightly observes,161 modern, for we may assume that the burning of an effigy in the Midsummer bon-fires is far older than the time of Luther. The ceremony of "Carrying out Death" is generally fol lowed by a ceremony of "Bringing in Summer."162 If Hunger and Death are driven out, Wealth and Life must be brought in to take their places. "Bringing the Summer" was a procession with a tree or branch or with a leaf-clad mummer as symbolical of the spirit of vegetation returning or reviving in spring.163 Some times the resurrection of the "dead Carnival" is also enacted as a symbolical expression of the revival of vernal Ml?, in spring. These ceremonies are still observed in Germany164 and in other countries.165 The contrast between the dormant state of the powers of vegetation in winter and their awakening in spring also took the form of a dramatic contest. In this ceremony the two contending parties are no longer felt to be only two successive representatives of the same principle, but represent two oppos ing principles. They are not considered as the new and old fertility spirits, but as the god of light and life struggling against his antagonist, the demon of darkness and death. The battle is usually fought not between individuals, but between groups. It is not a single but a collective combat. The representatives of summer and winter each have their train of followers. The Antichoria in the Greek comedy, which may be traced back to this battle between Summer and Winter, consisted of two opposed companies with different characters or masks.166 Faded survivals of this combat may be seen in the rural custom 160 Ibid., x. 167, 172, xi. 23. 161 Ibid., x. 167. 162 Ibid., iv. 233. 165 Ibid., ii. 74, iv. 2525gg. 164 Ibid., iv. 233, 2375gg., 2465gg. mIbid., iv. 2495gg. 166 C/.

It is quite common in the German lands, especially on both sides of the Middle Rhine.169 It also formed a part of the Schembartlauf in Nuremberg. The custom is usually observed as a part of the Carnival ceremonies on Shrove Tuesday,170 but also at the spring equinox,171 on May Day,172 and at Whitsuntide.173 There were also held at Carnival more or less serious battles as a means of promoting the fertility of the crops.174 The tug-of war, for instance, is still practised among many primitive peoples as a fertility charm.175 We still have a Shrovetide tug-of-war in England.176 A related custom is the ceremony with whips and brooms on Senseless Thursday, the last Thursday in Carni val, in the Tyrol.177 The broom is considered an excellent protection against witches and evil spirits.178 The marchers in the Carnival procession in Cologne brush those in front of them with brooms in order to rid them of ghosts.179 Whipping on Shrove Tuesday was a similar means of purification.180 This 167 Cf.

The ritual combat between the two champions sometimes became in modern survivals a dialogue in verse, as is still found in some parts of Bavaria.183 The custom in this form gave rise to the rich literature of debates which the Middle Ages produced in Europe. The poetical tournaments, such as the tenso of the Provence and the S?ngerkrieg in Germany may likewise be attributed to the influence of this practice. The contest between the representatives of Summer and Winter may also take the form of a trial, in which a judge pro nounces the sentence of death over the champion of Winter. The custom in this form accounts for the court-proceeding as a part of the ceremony of beheading the straw-man in Germany and France,184 and for the presence of a judge and (somewhat less commonly) of an executioner in a number of mummers' plays in Germany and England.185 The prevalence of the court trial in the Carnival plays may also be traced back to this custom. In the ritual battle between the good and the evil spirit the good spirit is not always the victor. In a great number of instances he is, indeed, slain by his antagonist, is laid in the ground or sent out upon the waters with great lamentations, descends into Hades, and on the third day rises again to a new life.

The Carnival Comedy The ship-procession, although it was, as we have seen, the most prominent and the most permanent feature of the Car nival, could not have issued in drama. The Carnival-waggon could at best but form the stage for the play, and this, in fact, was the case in a number of towns in the Netherlands and Germany,190 though not in Nuremberg, which was the real home of the Carnival play. As the ship-cart in the Schembartlauf was, as a rule, burned at the end of the procession together with its occupants, it would necessarily follow that it contained stuffed figures, but no living persons. The old objection of the Kelto-Germanic peoples to the representation of agricultural gods by human beings191 seems to have continued longer in Nur emberg than in other German towns. It even extended to those figures of the ritual drama, such as the fool and the doctor,192 which, as will be shown later,193 were but the lower demons of vegetation. mIibd., v. 8s?. Ibid., vii. 15.

Mr. Cornford's attempt to lead back the old Attic comedy through the folk-play to the ritual procedure, which he reconstructed with great ingenuity, has in the opinion of the writer, not been very successful. The old Attic comedy, like the medieval German farce, does not show in its plot a similarity to the ritual sufficient to warrant any such assump tion. The ritual in itself had but few histrionic possibilities. The parts of the medieval religious drama which were based on the Church liturgy also proved incapable of dramatic evolution. Between the ritual and the drama, as we understand it, there yawns a mighty chasm. We can have drama only when a wholly new content has been given to the ritual. This fact applies with special force to comedy. The ritual plot, above all, can not be used for the comical drama. The marriage, which forms the canonical ending of all our comedies, may, as Cornford sug gests,194 be a survival of the ritual union of sexes, but the central episode of the ritual drama, the death and resurrection of the fertility god, would in comedy, as Cornford admits,195 be either too serious or too silly. The motive of rejuvenation is only burlesqued in the Carnival plays.196 The marriage, though forming the ending of Aristophanic comedy, is totally lacking in the Carnival plays of Germany, perhaps owing to the fact that, because of the late arrival of spring in Northern Europe, the magical marriage did not seem to form a part there of the Carnival customs. A few Carnival plays, however, have a wedding as a background (Nos. 7, 41, 86, 115, 130, and XVIII).197 The ritual drama never passed into the literary stage, but sank to the plane of a degenerate folk-play, of the kind that we still find in Northern Greece, England and Germany. These mummers' shows are just what we would expect of a ritual 194 Op. cit., p. 18. 196 Ibid., p. 75. 196 Infra, p. 445. 197 The Arabie numerals refer to the edition of Fastnachtsspiele by Adalbert von Keller (1853 &amp; 1858).

They always keep the same plot and the same unvarying char acters from year to year, having taken over the dramatic inci dents of the ritual with the minimum of literary intervention. They may have been turned in some instances into puppet plays in so far as the living actors were degraded into mechanical figures. In the Kasperlespiel and the English Punch and Judy show, the hero, who triumphs over the Devil and Death, may, indeed, originally have been a representative of the vegeta tion spirit. We have seen that stuffed figures stood from the very first for the vegetation powers in the Nuremberg Sehern bertlauf. But these rustic folk-plays never assumed a literary form. They never merged with the main current of dramatic evolu tion. They have lingered on down to the present day wholly independent of the literary drama. While they, indeed, share the plot with the Carnival ritual, they show no links whatever with the Carnival play. The view expressed by J. G. Robertson,198 that the drama in all literatures may ultimately be led back to the conflict of Spring and Winter must not be understood in the sense that the conflict of wills, which is the very centre and soul of all drama, is to be traced back to the ritual combat between the powers of good and evil. The root of the drama we will find neither in this nor in any other incident in the ritual. The dance, and especially the armed dance, has been more commonly considered as the source of the drama.199 We know from analogy with existing savages that the dance formed an essential part of all the agricultural festivals of Europe.200 Early Greek vases show certain masked dances presumably intended to promote the growth of the crops. The ship procession in Nuremberg and probably elsewhere was accom panied by masked dances.201 Processional and round dances 198 A History of German Literature (^1902), p. 181; cf. also Grimm, op. cit., ii. 784. 199 Cf.

The drama of savage peoples is for the most part danced.209 The dances of the Mexicans at their religious festivals remained for a long time the basis of all their dramatic acts.210 The fertility ritual was everywhere performed in pantomimic dances.211 We may, therefore, safely assume that the dance has been a great factor in the development of the drama among the Germanic peoples. This fact will account for the prevalence of the dance in the Carnival plays. Quite a number of them close with an invitation to dance and a call for music (Nos. 6, 51, 59, 67, 89, 111). The word dance occurs even in the titles of a few plays (Nos. 14,67, 89, XIV). The dance seems to have formed such an essential part of the Carnival plays that even Hans Sachs provided for it in two of his earlier pieces (Nos. 2, 9). This fact leads Creizenach212 to the conclusion that the Carnival plays were for the most part but little more 202 Cf. Frazer, op. cit., ix. 2385gg.

Of the dances, which have left their traces in the Carnival plays, the sword-dance is the most important. Like the Pyrrhic dance of the Greeks, the Germanic armed dance was fundament ally mimic in character.213 We know that the sword-dance was quite popular with the Germanic warrior tribes. Tacitus describes it as the one form of spectaculum to be seen at the gatherings of the Germans with which he was conversant. The dancers, he tells us, were young men who leapt with much agility amongst meancing spearpoints and sword-blades.214 This dance was fairly common at Shrovetide and other folk festivals throughout the German lands. The earliest medieval notice of it as a popular ludus is at Nuremberg in 1350, when the Schembartlauf maskers first received permission to perform it. The morris-dance, a variant of the sword-dance,215 was also quite common among the Germans.216 The term occurs in the titles of two Carnival plays (Nos. 14, XIV), and is mentioned in Nos. 99 and 31. The dispute between K. M?llenhofP17 and Chambers218 as to whether the sword-dance, including the morris dance, was originally a fertility rite or a war charm is unimport ant, since the fertility gods were also war-gods, as may be seen from an analogy with old Mexican beliefs.219 We shall now under stand why the Nuremberg Schembartlauf maskers carried in the right hand a wintergreen as a symbol of fertility, and in the left a spear as a symbol of victory in war.220 The symbolical meaning of the swords was later lost, and the dancers were supposed to use them in their fight against the evil spirits of unfruitfulness.221 The morris-dancers replaced the 213 Cf.

In a similar way the bells which were attached to the caps of the morris-dancers were supposed to be a potent means to expel demons223 and to awaken the good spirits of vegetation from their winter sleep,224 whereas, as will be shown later, the swords, the bells, and the black faces, all constituted the char acteristic demonic outfit of the performers of the dances as magical rites for the vernal reanimation of nature. The sword-dancers performed in pantomime the fertility ritual. A few reminiscences of their former r?le as characters In the ritual drama are still clinging to them. Among the names for the sword-dancers in some parts of Germany we find Gr?nwald or Wilder Waldmann, which stamp them as represen tatives of the old vegetation spirits. A great number of the sword-dances in Germany also have the doctor and the fool,225 two of the stock figures in the ritual drama. In three or four of the sword-dances in Germany a dramatic feature of the mock death and resurrection actually precedes or follows the regular figures of the dances.226 Similar instances of sword-dances con taining a scene of the mimic death and resurrection are on record in ancient Thrace227 and modern England.228 In a Bohemian sword-dance the fool has his female counterpart in a Mehlweib.229 This character is the Germanic Mother Corn (Old Bessy in England)?230 Her name points to a function in the ritual drama, which we will understand by analogy with the summer cere monies of the American Indians, at which sacred meal is sprinkled by an old woman on the dancers.231 222 Cf.

Creizenach and Chambers seem to think that having once shown a connection between the sword-dance and the ritual drama the origin of the Carnival play in the sword-dance natural^ follows. What we are warranted in assuming is that the sword-dance is related to the rustic mummery with which, owing to their common origin, it shares a number of features and figures. But we fail to see any common elements in the sword-dances and the Carnival plays. The fact that sword dances were sometimes executed at the close of these plays need not necessarily presuppose an inner connection between them. Dances were, for instance, inserted into Shakespearean plays even when they were not properly in keeping with the action. It is hard to imagine the process by which a literary drama could evolve out of a sword-dance. A sword-dance is not in itself, a drama, for drama is only reached when imitation or representation extends to action. We have, furthermore, no evidence that the sword-dance ever took on comic elements and attempted the protrayal of contemporary life, which is the very essence of the Carnival plays. Together with the ritual drama, for which it appears to have served as a kind of frame-work, the sword-dance, having lost its religious meaning, was perpetuated as a popular game or show, but has never influenced the literary drama. For the origin of the Carnival play as of the drama in general we must look not so much to any of the magical rites, but rather more to the actors who performed them. We know from early Greek vases that the dancers were masked. As a matter of fact, masks were worn at all the ceremonies intended to promote the growth of the crops.232 The masks formed the most essential element of the fertility worship and have survived down to the present day in our Carnival amusements. But it need hardly be said that our ancestors did not put them on for the reason we now do at our mask balls in order to conceal our identity while 232 Cf. Frazer, op. cit., ix. 236, 240, 2425gg., 247, 248, 251.</page><page sequence="30">The Origin of the German Carnival Comedy 431 we behave in a way that might have unpleasant consequences if we were recognized. Neither did they deck themselves in their costumes of leaves and flowers, of hides and horned heads for the beneficial influence of the indwelling divinity, as Chambers conjectures.233 There can be no doubt that the masqueraders meant to impersonate the powers of fertility in nature. We are well familiar with these field and forest spirits from the classic works of Mannhardt.234 The tree-worship of the ancient Ger mans is now well established beyond any possibility of doubt.235 As a matter of fact, it is well attested for all the great European families of the Aryan stock.236 Palm Sunday is a relic of ancient tree-worship. The palm was deified by the ancients. Among the trees worshipped in Egypt the palm ranked highest.237 The fertility spirits were not discarded by primitive man when he conceived the idea of a god. The notion of a god, as Chambers well remarks,238 is much the old notion of an anthropomorphic elemental spirit, widened, extended, and further removed from sense. "The god does not annul the more bounded and the more concrete personifications of natural forces. They survive in popular credence as his servants and ministers."239 The masked men and women who performed the ritual were but acting the r?les of these ministering spirits of vegetation. They were performing the acts which they had learned from these demons. There must have been a time not so far back in their memories when the god or genius of the rite appeared with his demons among them in order to perform the magical acts necessary for the generation of life in spring.240 When the superhuman actors had ceased to appear, their devotees assumed their masks and their r?les in order to continue the religious practices which they considered wholly indispenable for the renewal and prosperity of vegetation. We do not know at what period in the history of the 233 Op. cit., i. 166. 234 Roggenwolf u. Roggenhund (1865); Die Kornd?monen (1868); Wald= u. Feldkulte der Germanen, Bd. I (1875), Bd.

But there can be no doubt that the human performers of the ritual were the successors of the demonic agents of nature. We must bear in mind that it was not the pleasure of imitation, but the reli gious or rather, the magical purpose which made them act the part of the demons. Worship was in its origin by no means a matter of praise and prayer. Primitive man was wholly concerned with his nutritive needs and had but one object with his rites and ceremonies, namely, to influence the course of nature to supply his material wants. When his god no longer appeared with his (god's) agents on earth for the purpose of carrying out the process of the resurrection of nature, consider ing him no longer worthy of this boon, he (primitive man), per force, had to undertake the work himself. When the original meaning of the masks was lost, they were understood to be a necessary outfit at the expulsion of demons.241 Primitive man, then, hoped that by assuming a mask he would not be recognized by the demons and might perhaps even be taken as one of them. But it must be said to the credit of our ancestors that in their eagerness to resemble them they often overshot the mark and wore masks fit to terrify the most fero cious of the demons. The mysterious force which resides in the mask, moreover, was believed to pass into the wearer, to turn him into a mighty demon, and to endow him with the power of banning demons or earning their favor.242 There is not the slightest doubt that the masked men dele gated to perform the ritual acts were regarded by the rest of the community as the demons whom they represented.243 To the primitive mind the actor is, for the time being, the god or demon whom he indicates. The following story from medieval Leipzig will be of interest in the light of our present dis cussion. It is recorded that when, in 1499, a girl had stabbed during Carnival a masked young man to death because he had teased her, she defended herself in court by declaring that she had not killed a human being, but a demonic creature.244 The 241 Cf.

A statute of the ninth century forbids any presbyter to wear masks of demons, for "all this is devilish." Other records of the same century speak of the monks mumming as wolves, foxes, or bears, and of "other diabolical masquerades."246 It has already been stated that the Carnival-waggon was called by its clerical opponents malignorum spirituum execrabile domicilium (the accursed habitation of evil spirits).246 Henricus Lubertus (Lubbert), a Protestant clergyman, who lived in the second half of the seventeenth century, could find no better title for his diatribe against the whole Carnival season than Der Fastnachtsteufel (The Shrovetide Devil.) The Low German name for the pro cession of maskers is Schwodiivel, i.e. running about in a diaboli cal mask. Processions of maskers of this type were common in all parts of Germany in the Middle Ages.247 The best known of these medieval German processions is the Nuremberg Schembartlauf, which existed from about the middle of the fourteenth century down to the time of Hans Sachs.248 Schembart means a bearded mask (MHG. scheme is mask). By popular etymology the word was later changed to Sch?nbart. A parallel custom is the Perch tenlauf in the Alpine regions of Germany, which, at first, probably was held at che Carnival season, but later transferred in some parts of the Tyrol to Perchta's Day, which is Twelfth Night, or Epiphany Day.249 Schembartlaufen and Perchtenlaufen would point to the custom of running and leaping for the purpose 246 Cf.

Among them was a figure called "tailor," who carried a pair of huge stretching-shears. A counterpart of this article is found among the Hopi of Arizona, whose god appears at their summer festivals with a long pair of wooden stretching-shears. J. W. Fewkes believes that the shears represent the lighting-flash hurled by the god.253 As human representatives of the vernal spirits of vegetation, the maskers were dressed in leaves and blossoms, branches and flowers.254 These leaf-clad mummers, the so-called Wilde M?anner und wilde Weiber, were standing figures in the Nurem berg Schembartlauf.2hb To wear green on St. Patrick's day is a survival of this custom. The flowers and fruits on the spring hats of the women of today are also relics of this ancient practice. In the Carnival processions of Central Europe were also seen men and women with heads of animals.256 There are clear traces of a stage in which the demons of vegetation were regarded among the ancients as animals.257 A Christian parallel is to depict Christ in the form of a lamb {Agnus Dei). The Greek stories of the transformation of gods into beasts point to a ritual custom in which the actors representing the gods were masked as animals.258 There were beast choruses in Attic comedy. Men and women with heads of animals were seen in the Nuremberg Schembartlauf.2 In the modern survivals of the ancient spring customs the leaf-clad mummers curiously enough Ibid., ix. 23Ssqq. *lIbid., x. 107sq., llOsqq., U3sqq., 179, 3395g. 252 Supra, p. 422. 253 Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1903, p. 90.

The Perchta-racers wore bells,263 a fact which strengthens our argument that they were representatives of vegetation demons. Bells are also worn by the human representatives of the vegetation spirits in Mexico.264 Their white garments were meant to suggest their incorporeal forms. Garments of this color were also worn by the impersonators of the Roman larvae. Demons of the most varied figure played a significant part in the medieval processions of maskers. Among them there must also have been a masque of Death, which gave rise to the medieval pageant known as dance macabre (Totentanz in German).265 There were masks of devils in the Nuremberg Schembartlauf266 and in the Salzburg Perchtenlauf.2G1 The Ulm maskers painted their faces black,268 and a black face was a feature in the medieval representation of devils. The devil already had appeared as an Ethiopian in the days of the Church fathers. The black face may also be seen in the modern survivals of the ancient agricultural customs in Central Europe.

The leaf-clad mum mer in England, Jack-in-the-Green, is a chimney-sweep.273 In the Carnival folk-plays of Northern Greece274 and in the St. George mummers' plays of England275 the antagonist is sometimes represented with a blackened face. The conjectural reason which Chambers276 gives for the black face as a survival of the primitive custom of smearing the face with the beneficent ashes of the holy festival-fire is too phantastic to be taken seriously. Ashes, moreover, do not entirely blacken the face. It is perhaps more reasonable to assume in the light of our discussion that the black face was typical of a certain type of demons. As only a part of the maskers at the fertility ceremonies had black faces, we must assume that not all demons of vegetation were black. It is, therefore, necessary to postulate different classes of demons with different functions in the train of the heathen god just as there are different kinds of angels at the court of Jahveh. The 'Sooty Ones,' we may in all likelihood assume, were the phallic demons. The black color may perhaps signify the night, out of which they have emerged,277 or stamp them as dark and mysterious powers on whom human procreation depended. Reference has already been made to the black figures on an amphora, which represents the epiphany of Phales or Dionysus in a ship.278 The two actors who perform an obscene panto mime in the modern Thracian Carnival play, which is a survival of the ancient Dionysiac rites, have blackened faces.279 The bearer of the phallus among the phallphori, the human successors to the phallic demons in the Dionysia, was, as we learn from Sernos' book On Paeans, "smeared with soot."280 His companions, who, notwithstanding their name, did not have the phallus, were not black-faced.

The dancers were thought to represent Moors because their faces were blackened.282 The phallic demons may be traced back to the Vedic age.283 There were phallic demons also among the German vegetation spirits.284 The god Freyr of the ancient Norsemen and Germans was worshipped under the form of a phallus.285 His consort Freya was also represented with this symbol.286 The phallic demons were regarded as clowns owing to the fact that their function as participants in the ritual was somewhat comical. Their obscene pantomimic acts could not help but strike the on-lookers as funny. They supplied the comic element in the mythical drama. Few morris-dancers are complete without one or more comical figures. The Fasch ingsnarr ("Carnival-Fool") was also a prominent figure in the medieval procession of maskers.287 Neither is he missing in the Carnival procession of the modern German cities. He is so essential a Carnival figure that the last day of Carnival is named after him in some parts of Germany. Shrove Tuesday is still known in the Rhineland as Narrenfest or N arr en kirchweih. The fool is a stock figure in the English and German mummers' plays.288 There is also a crop of fools in the German Carnival comedies (Nos. 13, 14, 17, 20, 32, 38, 44, 110, 116, 119, 132).

As a matter of fact, the fool and the devil originally were identical in person and may be traced back to the demonic clown of the ancient heathen days. P. Paris correctly derives the French arlequin (German Harlekin) from the Low Germ&amp;nhellekin (Little Devil).290 The fool may now appear to be a supernumerary person among the morris-dancers. But just as the Mehlweib, who also is one of their number, originally had, as we have seen,'291 a magical act to perform, so the fool also played an important part in the ritual drama. His act, though some what comical, was for this reason not any the less sacred than the other acts, as may be seen from its analogy to the sacred customs of the Zu?ians. Our argument that the clownish demon had the phallus will be supported by the analogy to the comic figures in the Turkish play of shades (Karag?z) and in the Javanese puppet-play (Semar.)292 His sooty appearance has in time been shared by one or the other of the ritual performers. When the dead vegetation spirit later came to be looked upon as a sort of scape-goat and was laden with all the follies com mitted during the Carnival season, the name of Carnival Fool was transferred to him293 and he, too, was smeared with soot. The black appearance of the antagonist in the modern survivals is chiefly due to Christian influence, as is very evident from the chain, which he holds at times in his hands. It was the phallic demon, the clown among the fertility agents, who became the actor. How many of his characteristics have gone over to the actor cannot be stated with any precision. It is certain, however, that voracity and obscenity go back to the phallic demon.294 Greek comedy according to Aristotle took its rise in the Phallika (Poet. iv. 12). The phantastic costume of the actor in Greek comedy corresponds entirely to the phallic type of demons,295 as they appear on the Corinthian vases in Thiasos.296 He originally appeared in no other form but as 290 Quoted ibid. 291 Supra, p. 429. 292 Cf.

The theory in regard to the demonic origin of the Greek drama gains further weight by the analogies which Preuss has drawn with the fertility ceremonies of the Mexican and American Indians. The same origin may, there fore, with great probability be assumed also for the German drama. This theory does not contradict the view that the source of the drama is in the dance. The origin of all drama may, indeed, lie in the mimic dance, but the dance belongs to the nature of the demons, and had a phallic significance in Greece as well in the Orient299. The mimic dance is, as a matter of fact, a special feature of the demons.300 It is characteristic for both groups of demons in Greece, the Curet?s in Crete and the Corybants in Phrygia.301 The dancers on the early Greek vases, as has been repeatedly pointed out,302 were beast-clad figures, which means that they were theriomorphic demons. The Kelto-Germanic sword-dancers show their demonic origin by their black faces no less than by their swords and bells. The medieval missionaries and monks, who branded the dance as "devilish," as "the fiendish delight of hell," were not far from the truth after all. The acts of the demons were, as has already been pointed out, originally sacred rites intended for the regeneration of nature. But very soon episodes were added which had no connection with the magical ceremonies. It is wholly in accord with the nature of these clownish demons that they, having acted their part in the ritual drama, should wish to have a little fun with the on-lookers and try their mimic arts on them.303 They were soon, indeed, asked to imitate certain individuals in the throng,304 and they did what was asked of them with great 297 Cf., Preuss, Archiv}.

They gladly exhibited their mimic talent, for they were in a happy mood and in the very swing of it, as it were. We learn from Sernos that the phallophori after having sung the phallic songs ran forward and ridiculed persons in the aud ience.305 Among the Zu?i there is more or less fun-making throughout all their sacred dances.306 We shall not wonder at the fun-making acts in connection with the sacred fertility rites when we bear in mind that fun was not excluded even from the Church service, and that comic scenes taken from real life alter nated in the ecclesiastical drama with episodes drawn from the life and passion of Christ. Furthermore, just as some of these comic scenes were separated in the course of time and performed independently from the Church plays, so some of the farcical acts broke loose from the ritual dramas, and served as entertain ments for our ancestors in their homes and banquet halls. It is very evident, therefore, that all drama is of demonic origin. We must now admit that the Church Fathers were indeed right when they declared that all dramatic arts come from the devil (Pseudo-Cyprian, Sped. 4; Tatian, Or at. ad Graec. 22). The Carnival comedy is, as we have seen, of country origin. Peasants were its first actors. Wlien the Carnival festival, however, was adopted by the towns, the burghers replaced the peasants as Carnival players. It was in their hands that the drama could develop as an art. Among the country people the comic pieces would have remained to the present day mere shows and games just as has been the case with the ritual parts. The actors soon broke with the tradition and laid aside the phallus and the black mask. The phallus was dropped in the West earlier than in the East. Reich has, however, brought to evi dence the fact that the mime retained the phallus for many centuries of our common era.307 The long hair of the actors is a modern survival of their original demonic appearance. The demons in the Dionysiac rites preserved their hair in honor 306 Cf. Cornford, op. cit., p. 43. 306 Cf. J. W. Fewkes, "A Few Summer Ceremonials at Zu?i Pueblos," Journal of Am.

Everything seems to point to the fact that the Carnival originally was in the hands of women. The carrus navalis, after which it has been named, was the sacred symbol of the earth-goddess. The festival originally fell within the Weibermonat (the women's month), as the month of February is called in Germany, for the reason that im Februar j?hren die Frauen das Regiment" (in the month of February the women rule).310 The last day of Carnival?Shrove Tuesday? is still known in certain parts of Germany as Weiberfastnacht (Women's Shrovetide) or Altweiberfastnacht (Old Women's Shrovetide). In certain districts of Germany there still exists a dance at Carnival called ein Tanz der Weiberzunft (a dance of the woman's guild.) The reason for the prominence of women in the Carnival ceremonies is not hard to find. We have seen that the earliest ceremonial observances of this sort were connected with agricultural life, and we know from analogy with existing savages that European agriculture in its early stages was an affair of the women.311 The men, who hunted, worshipped the heavens, whence came the light, but the women, who tilled the soil, carried on earth-worship. The men's divin ity took on a male form, and the women's a female form. The heaven-father had his counterpart in the earth-mother. The goddess of the fertility of the earth, moreover, was also the goddess of the fertility of women.312 The first servants of the goddess of fertility were priestesses, or, at a later date, men dressed as women.313 The procession of men wearing women's clothes, with brooms and fire-works, on Fastnacht at Erlingen314 points to that earlier stage when the priests had to perform 808 Cf.

Men also dressed as women in the Dionysiac rites.315 The witch is a degraded form of the old priestess of fertility, and the Witches' Sabbath, which was not altogether an imaginary affair, but really had a foundation in fact,316 is but a secret survival of the ancient fertility rites.317 The Bacchanalia, the Roman festivals of Bacchus (Dionysus) were at first celebrated by women only. A ceremony similar to our May-pole is still celebrated in Ceylon by women only. In Styria and Carinthia it was the custom down to recent times for women and girls to draw a plough through the fields in the spring.318 The custom of hitching young unmarried women to the plough at Carnival exists down to the present day in some parts of Germany.319 Women were often yoked to the sacred ship, which was led in procession at the Carnival festival. They often rode in the ship apparently as human representatives of the fertility demonesses. In a record of the L?beck Carnival procession of 1458 we read that there were sixteen women and eight men in the ship-cart which accidentally turned over. Down to the middle of the eighteenth century a custom prevailed at Rome that at Carnival women rode in waggons which were shaped like ships.320 We learn from the account of the rigoristic monk Rudolfus321 that women with hair dishevelled and with a shirt for their only garment danced "in devilish fashion" around the ship wherever it halted on 316 Cf. Frazer, op. cit., iv. 258. 316 Cf. Wall, op. cit., p. 367. 317 Cf. Pearson, op. cit., ii. 83. Satan was but the successor to the ancient phallic gods, whom we can recognize in all the disguises which he has assumed at the secret meetings on the Blocksberg. The vows which the ancients ad dressed to their gods the medieval men and women addressed to Satan; cf. S. Brown, II, Sex Worship and Symbolism of Primitive Races (1916), p. 87. It is, however, probable, that the orgies connected with the sex or fertility festivals of the ancient Scandinavians and Germans were due to Roman influences; cf. Dulare, op. cit., pp. 89, 367. In all likelihood the phallic element was directly introduced into Northern Europe by the Phoenicians, who carried on commerce with the tribes of Scandinavia; cf. ibid., p. 90.

Women also danced in the Brussles Ommeganck around the ship-cart "seminu dae, alias simplice tantum cl?mide circumtande,}) and the dances lasted, we are told, "usque ad noctis medium.*22 In a Leipzig Mid-Lent (originally Carnival) custom which lasted down to the eighteenth century, the public women played a part which makes them appear as representatives of the vegetation demon esses. They carried about the streets a puppet fitted with a phallus, which they showed to young married women to make them fruitful.323 Women appear in this quality in the Mexican summer ceremonies when they dance and indulge in obscene acts with soldiers.324 As the god of fertility was also the god of war, soldiers as well as harlots were regarded as demons. We know at least of one instance in Germany in which soldiers appear in a mummers' procession,325 and that is in Pilsen. In Rome there was the mimad as well as the mime, and as a matter of fact she was looked upon as the same as the Greek hetaera or the Roman delicia. They were all demonesses of a low order. The Ger manic Mother Corn was called die grosse Hure. It follows from the facts adduced that there were female counterparts of the phallic demons,326 who in their human form evolved into mimads. We may, therefore, well assume that women had at first a share in the Carnival plays. In the medieval performances of which we have record, however, women's parts were played by men for the reason that it was considered?and in certain parts of the world still is considered?improper for a woman to act a part in public. The elements of vulgarity and obscenity, of nastiness and lasciviousness, which are found in abundance in the Carnival plays must be explained by their phallic origin. Harsh, indeed, 322 Cf., J. W. Wolf, op. cit., xii. 38. 328 Grimm's view {op. cit., ii. 769 n. 1) that it was an effigy of Death is erroneous, as may be seen from parallel customs in the Orient. The women of Egypt carried about at their village festivals, according to Herodotus (Raw linson's translation, ii. 48; cf. also Cornford, op. cit., p. 48) puppets of a cubit in height, fitted with a phallus of nearly the same length, worked by means of strings. 324 Cf.

Says Gervinus: Unanst?ndigkeit ist die Seele des Fastnachtsspiels. ("Indecency is the soul of the Shrovetide play.") Stronger is the condemnation uttered by Goedecke: Jeder Sprecher ein Schwein, jeder Spruch eine Roheit, jeder Witz eine Unfl?terei. ("Every speaker is a pig, every speech is a vulgarity, every joke is an obscenity"). It must be admitted that unchaste scenes were represented in these comedies with an astonishing realism. The modern reader of these plays finds it hardly credible that pieces so frankly indecent could have been performed in public and patronized by assembled families, including both sons and daughters. The players often carried their immorality so far that the city authorities frequently had to impose a fine for immoral or improper words or acts. The only explanation that can be offered is the well-known fact that tradition dies hard. How much decent people will stand when objectionable features have the sanction of tradition may be seen from an analogy with the ceremonies of the so-called back ward races of today. Fewkes tells us that the obscene puns and jokes of the mud-heads, the demonic clowns, who appear at the summer ceremonies of the Zu?i Pueblos, "are so disgusting that it seems impossible to believe that any of the more prominent of the Zu?ians would take this part in the dances. No attempt is made or thought of among the on-lookers, which at the close of the afternoon includes all the population clothed in their best attire, to repress the obscenity and vulgarity of the clowns."327 It would, indeed, be a great injustice to our ances tors to take the Carnival plays as a criterion of their sex moral ity. The Carnival player was not bound by the morals of his day. He owed his freedom to his origin from the phallic demon. A recent German writer, judging from the Carnival amusements in the great cities of modern Germany, deeply laments seeing "how far removed we Germans are from the seriousness attri buted to us."328 The fact of the matter is that the Germans are not a light-hearted race. The jesting and buffoonery so common at the Carnival are not innate in the Germanic peoples. 827 Journal of Am. Ethn. &amp; Arch., i. 23n2. 028 H. S. Rehm, Deutsche Volksfeste u.

They are the bequerts of the phallic demons to their successors in the fertility cult. The Carnival plays, having originated in the buffoonery of the phallic demons, are mainly occupied with the familiar facts of human life. Their subject-matter deals chiefly with the follies and vices of the men and women present or comical events of the day. The most popular acts were domestic quarrels and conjugal fights. The physician in the midst of sick peasants, the peasant-wedding, the comic discussions, the market-scenes and court-proceedings are frequent themes. In a later stage of its development the Carnival plays were also used for satirical, controversial, and didactical purposes. The herald or the principal actor, as a rule, pointed out at the end of the perform ance the lesson which the spectators were to take home with them. This pious interpretation of the Carnival play is due to the influence of the Church drama. The playwrights, later, also drew for their material upon heroic legend (Breton, German and Trojan), beast-fables (in L?beck), popular story (German and Italian), and even upon biblical history. A few plays deal with the lives and legends of the saints. But whatever the subject matter may be, it is always expressed in the crude realism of contemporary life. But although the Carnival plays did not evolve out of the. ritual dramas, they naturally borrowed themes and types from them. The clownish demons in their cheerful mood, it would seem, mimicked not only the on-lookers, but also the sacred acts and their performers. We have seen that the motive of death and resurrection could not be used as a comical plot. However, executions of the type which we still find as an episode in the sword-dances of modern Germany occur in the play of Dietrich of Bern (No. 62) and in the play of the magician (No. IX). In Tanaw?schel (No. 54) the execution is more of the nature of the expulsion of evil. The magical act of rejuvenation is bur lesqued in the comical attempts by the quack doctor to turn old women into young girls, a motive very common in the Swiss plays. In the lost L?beck play of the three knights, who won a young maiden from the world of the dead, and in Jutta (No. Ill), who was redeemed from hell upon the intercession of the Virgin Mary, we have a dramatization of the motive of the descent into</page><page sequence="45">446 Rudwin Hades. The Sterzing play of May and Autumn (No. XVI) is based on the contest of Summer and Winter. It is related to the Dutch Abel speel van dem winter ende van dem somera To this ritual act may be traced, as has been noted,330 the plays which are but dramatized debates or disputations (Nos. 1 and 106). Related to this type are the pieces which have the form of a legal trial {e.g., Nos. 29, 40, 42, 51, 52, 61, 73, 87, 110, 112, 130) or of question and answer {e.g., Nos. 27, 63). The free for-all fights, which often occur in the Carnival farces, may perhaps also be traced back to the ritual battles. A number of Carnival customs also have left their traces in the Carnival plays. The drawing of a plough furnishes a motive for play No. 30. The race for a bride is employed in the competition by representatives of all trades and professions for the hand of a maiden (Nos. 70, XVIII). The basic theme of the Neidhart plays (Nos. 21, 53, XXVI) is a May game, and the lost L?beck play of the youth, who kissed a maiden, probably was a dramatization of a spring custom, in which the sleeping bride, symbolical of the dormant earth, was kissed back to life and love by her bridegroom,331 a motive which also underlies the stories of Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Little Red Riding Hood. First among the types of the ritual drama to be ridiculed was the doctor, whose function was to restore the slain to life. He is the oldest comical figure in the German drama,332 and may be traced back to the Vedic age.333 The Arzt or Salbenkr?mer of theGerman Carnival comedies (Nos. 6, 48, 82, 85, 98, 101, 120, IV, VI, XIX, XXI, XXIV) is kinsman of the Dottore of Italian comedy, of Dr. Caius in the Merry Wives of Windsor, and of the M?decin maigre lui. The priest shared with the doc tor the fate of the medecine-man, a part of whose functions, notably the hocus-pocus, he had taken over. As a comical figure he belongs to the types of a later period, but he, too, is already to be found in the Indian and Greek mime.334 The 329 Text in Horae Belgicae, ed. by Hoffmann von Fallersleben, vi.

The learned pedant is also a subject for ridicule at the Carnival season. He is made a laughing stock in the plays of Solomon and Mdrkolf (No. 60), of The Emperor and the Abbot (No. 22), and of Aristole (Nos. 128, VII). The Old Woman is as ruthlessly caricatured in the German Carnival farce as she was in the Attic comedy.335 She still figures as a mummer in the Carnival folk-survivals,336 where she repre sents ther Germanic Mother Corn (Old Bessy in England).337 In the Thracian festival play she is the rustic prototype of Dem eter.338 We have already seen that in some folk-ceremonies she stands for the old and infirm vegetation spirit.339 The fact that the peasant, first and foremost, is the object of derision and contempt while the burgher is seldom held up to ridicule does not necessarily contradict our theory of the countryside origin of the Carnival play. Everything, in fact, points to a rustic origin of the German Carnival play as of the old Attic comedy.340 Since the peasant was the first successor to the phallic demon, he would naturally try his mimic arts first on his rustic friends and neighbors, the men and women who lived next door to him and whose foibles he well knew. But while the primitive peasant of earlier centuries carried on but a good-natured jesting with his co-devotees, the play became in the hands of the medieval burgher a vehicle of pitiless contempt for the weak and simple-minded countryman. This wholly un-Christian attitude towards the peasant is characteristic of medieval literature. The bourgeois satire, so lavished upon the helpless peasant, shows itself very rarely against the knights. In a few plays, however, they are represented as cowards and degenerates. On the whole, the knight of the medieval farce is the counterpart of the miles gloriosus of the ancient mime. 335 Cf. W.

The head garnished with ears, which he wears in the Nuremberg Carnival, is a heritage of the cap adorned with bells, which jingled at every step, on the heads of the performers of the morris-dance, in whose company he appeared at the fertility festivals. The Einschreier in the Carnival plays of the earliest extant type is identical with the Vors?nger or Leader in the sword dances.341 The fool's twin-brother, the devil, also has an important part in the Carnival plays. He has, however, been introduced into these pieces from the Church drama after he had imparted many of his qualities as the clownish demon of pagan days to the stern Satan from Judea (Nos. 21, 53, 56, 57, 111, 125, 126). The fool in the Carnival plays was, moreover, influenced in his r?le by the Fool-Ass rites, which in time became merged with the Carnival customs. For the Carnival has also fallen heir to the repertoire of the Feast of Fools or Asses342 and the Feast of Boys. These revels were first held by the inferior clergy or boy-choristers respectively in the medieval cathedrals and collegiate churches, but when the stricter clerics succeeded in suppressing them within the walls of the church, they passed from the churches into the streets and then from the vicars and choir-boys to the burghers. In their hands the amusements were transferred in the course of time from the New Year's festival to feasts which happened to fall at more congenial seasons of the year. In this way, the Roman Feast of Kalends, out of which the Feasts of Fools and Boys arose, was merged in the Ger manic Carnival. We find chcir-boys mentioned as Carnival players about the year 1500. The Feast of Fools occurs in Germany sporadically, although the term "Fools" was not used.343 The Feast of Boys appears to have been more popular among the Germans.344 It is also known as the Boy Bishop, since the dominus festi was almost universally a "bishop." 341 Cf. Schroeder, op. cit., p. 451. 842 The ass, an early and widespread, though not an invariable, feature, gave to the Feast of Fools one of its popular names. 843 Cf.

Ludi were played at both these feasts.345 The French sottie was a farce played by the sots, the ribald folk, who for a long time continued on the secular stage the traditions of the Fool-Ass rites.346 The Sotternien, the Dutch equivalents of the German Fastnachtsspiele, may be traced as far back as the fourteenth century. The solemnities of the Church continued to be burlesqued in these productions even in their burghal form; and while these farces originally satirized the canons and the burghers they later in their burghal form, turned their satire chiefly against the peasants; and the canons, too, fared no better in the hands of the burghers than in those of their inferior brethren. The Carnival inherited from the Fool-Ass rites the inversion of the social status and the idea of the univer sal dominion of folly, which had prevailed at the Kalends, Saturnalia and kindred Roman festivals.347 To the diffusion of the sotties throughout Europe may be attributed the abundance of fool-literature at the close of the Middle Ages and the suc ceeding century. The union of the Carnival?carrus navalis ?and the Feast of Fools is best symbolized in the Narrenschi? ("Ship of Fools"), which was a standing feature of the Carnival customs in many medieval German towns, and which gave the title to a satirical work by Sebastian Brandt (1494).348 The fool of the German Carnival play also coalesced with the old stupidus or parasitus of the Roman mime, who was of similar origin. The Fastnachtsspiel would thus serve as a connecting link between the ancient and the modern drama. That some dramatic tradition was handed down from the mimi of the Empire to the mimi of the Middle Ages, is, in the opinion of Chambers, exceedingly likely, although net capable of demonstration.349 "The renaissance of farce in the fifteenth 345 Ibid., i. 295. 346 Ibid., i. 380s?; Petit de Julleville, Histoire du th??tre en France (1886), p. 61; G.

"Driven from their theatres, they still had a vogue, not only at banquets, but at popular merry-makings or whenever in street or country they could gather together the remnant of their old audiences."351 To Teutonic manners these private performances seem to have commended them selves far more than the theatres.352 The Roman mimi were in fact absorbed into that vast body of nomad entertainers? ioculatores, histriones, scenici, homines vagi, on whom so much of the gaiety of the Middle Ages depended.353 What may be broadly designated as medieval minstrelsy was a coalition of the Roman mimus and the Germanic scop. There undoubtedly were elements of drama in minstrelsy.354 The French farce, the Spanish entremesa, and the English comical interlude arose out of the minstrel tradition.355 The best actor of the French farce was known as maistre mymin. The burlesque of Christian service, which we find now and then in the Carnival plays, is, as has been noted,356 a legacy to the Carnival players from the ribald clerics. "Familiarity breeds contempt, and it was almost an obvious sport on the part of the vicars and choir-boys to burlesque the sacred and tedious ceremonies with which they were only too painfully familiar."357 But the parody of Christian rites may also be attributed to the traditions of the Roman mime, with whom it was a favorite act. The comical treatment of Christ and St. Peter, which we find in the medieval drama, may also be put to his credit. Throughout paganism he had ridiculed the 360 Ibid., i. 855g. ^Ibid., i. 24. 352 Ibid. 353 Ibid., i. 25. 354Ibid., i. 77sqq.) Fr.

It cannot be denied that there is a great similarity between the Carnival play and the ancient mime. The risus mimicus may distinctly be heard at the Carnival. The essence of the Roman mime as of the Carnival play was keen observation and audacious portrayal of contemporary life, but both later extended their scope to mythological themes.358 As in the an cient mime so in the Carnival play of the earlier type the characters have no personal names, (e.g. Nos. 16, 18, 25, 33, 35, 36, 64, 65, 74, 86, 90, 91, 94, 99, 100). The imitation of classes and professions was already customary among the mimes of ancient Rome.359 The peasant was the laughing-stock of the mime of all peoples.360 The practice of ridiculing monks on /the stage was a favorite pastime with all mimes.361 The miles gloriosus, the ancient prototype of the medieval knight, is present in the mime of India, Greece and Italy.362 An especially favorite object for ridicule in the ancient mime was the Jew,363 and he is not overlooked in the medieval farce, either. The old woman in the Carnival plays is the cata carissa, and the inn keeper (No. 56) the copo compilatus of the Roman mime. Marital infidelity, which forms such a prominent motive in the medieval pieces, is also prominent in the ancient mimes,364 as is also the realistic-burlesque conception of woman, which we find to be such a marked feature of the Carnival plays. These are all artes mimicae, as Petron calls them. The similarities between the ancient mime and the medieval Carnival comedy may be explained by the fact that the medieval entertainers, the inheritors of the ancient mimes, as has been shown,365 very probably took a prominent part in the Carnival festivities and contributed to the humor of the season.

However, it is very difficult to trace the participation of professional entertainers in the per formances of medieval plays.366 The similarities between the ancient mime and the medieval farce at Carnival may rather be due to their similar origin in the magical rites of the fertility worship, although some amount of foreign influence coming on top of an independent growth in the Germanic Carnival customs need not be altogether denied. In addition to the alien professional spectacula the religious plays were not without influence on the Carnival comedies, although it is very difficult to state with any degree of precision on which side the debt was greater. The interrelations between mystery and mime in the Middle Ages as a fruitful field of investigation have been suggested by Reich in his monumental work on the ancient mime.367 It certainly cannot be possible that the two types of medieval drama should have existed side by side without influencing each other at all. With the lack of early texts of Carnival plays the question of priority must for the present remain unanswered. It is probable that the secular pieces in their literary form were posterior to the sacred plays. They may even have been modelled after them. But, then, the Church plays indirectly owed their origin to the heathen dramatic ceremonies from which the Carnival plays have sprung. For it was with the hope of withdrawing Chris tians from the pagan ludi that the Church permitted a sort of Christian drama. Furthermore, that part in the ecclesiastical ritual which ultimately took shape as drama showrs a most striking similarity to an incident in the heathen ritual. The Antichoria?the half choruses performing antiphonally at the Easter service, in which the roots of the Church drama are found?may, indeed, have been adopted from the heathen spring ritual where, in their original function, they represented two opposing groups in the contest of Summer and Winter. The allegorical lawsuit of Satan versus Christ, the altercatio Ecclesiae et Synagogae, and the conflict of Virtue and Vice may also be traced back to this heathen rite. The death and resurrection 366 Cf. Weinhold, op. cit., pp. 3l5g. See also A. Glock, Zs. f. vgl. Lit Gesch. xvi (1906). 367 Op. cit., ii. 859n.</page><page sequence="52">The Origin of the German Carnival Comedy 453 motive is common, as has been noted,368 to the Carnival ritual drama and the Easter play. The Marienklagen?lamentations of the Maries over the death of the Saviour?find their parallel in the wailings of the women over the death of the old fertility god in the heathen ritual.369 The dance of Mary Magdalene with a Roman officer in the A Isfeld Passion Play forms a parallel to the dance of the harlots with the soldiers at spring festivals, as may still be seen in Mexico.370 The dances of the angels and devils in the religious plays are but Christian adaptations of the dances of demons, which were, as we have seen,371 striking features of the Germanic folk-festivals. The dance of the Virgin Mary with the angels in the Alsfeld Passion Play has its parallel in the dance of Lilith with the devils in the play of Jutta, and both go back to the dance of the old woman at the village festi vals. The cock on a pillar, which warns Peter of his denial of his master in the Donaueschingen Passion Play is of heathen origin.372 We meet this fowl again in the titles of two Carnival plays (Nos. 67, 89). The Hahnentanz was a dance performed by the peasants at their fire-festivals round a cock placed on a pillar,373 and was not named after the prize which consisted of this fowl, as Creizenach surmises.374 The processional type of the religious drama, which was con nected with the Corpus Christi observance, must be attributed to the influence of the Carnival ship-procession. The satire upon social conditions in the pious plays probably came from the profane pieces. The comic types in the Carnival comedies appear also in the Church plays.375 The quack doctor, his wife and the rascally man-servant, the old woman, whom even 368 Supra, pp. 413s??. 369 Cf.

The devil in the mystery-plays owes many of this characteristics to the blackened demon, who had from ancient times been a favorite character at the folk-festivals.376 With the introduction of the vernacular into the Church plays the path was paved for the popular or, what may be more truly called, the comic element of the contemporary secular pieces. In this way the Church play came to have a great deal of the character of the Carnival comedy. Their similarity became, indeed, so great towards the close of the Middle Ages that they imperceptibly merged into each other. On the one hand, some of the comic scenes of the pious plays came to be separated and became independent farces. On the other hand, a Carnival comedy may very likely have served as an interlude in a religious production to add variety to the long-drawn represen tation of sacred subjects. The result is that it is not so easy to draw a line of demarcation between the sacred and the secular plays of the Middle Ages. An obvious link between the two types of drama is to be found in such plays as Theophilus and Jutta, which are brought technically within the scope of the miracle plays by the introduction of the Virgin or some other saint in the action. It would appear from the facts we have adduced that the Church drama owes after all more to the folk-play than the historians of the drama would fain admit, and that conse quently the folk-play has contributed somewhat more than "the tiniest rill to the mighty stream" of modern drama, as Chambers expresses it.377 Maximilian J.
