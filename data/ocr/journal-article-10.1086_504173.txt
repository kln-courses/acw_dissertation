      <p>In <italic>Do Animals Think?</italic> the psychologist Clive Wynne sets himself two tasks: (1) providing a readable overview of research in animal cognition, debunking claims that animals have language, consciousness, or selfawareness, and (2) refuting arguments by ethicists such as Peter Singer that animals deserve legal rights. His partial success regarding the first goal is overshadowed by his failure at the second. Although the book never defines thinking or answers its title question explicitly, Wynnes conclusion is clear: Animal thought is relatively unsophisticated and provides no basis for granting animals rights. I will first consider the books virtues and flaws as an overview of animal cognition research before discussing its ethical arguments.</p>
      <p>Animal cognition is a fastmoving field, with surprising new results appearing each year. Scholars from other disciplines might therefore welcome a balanced, readable introduction to animal cognition. Wynnes book looks promising: easily read in a day, with engaging prose sprinkled with wry humor and anecdote, it provides a broad overview of the field. At his best Wynne uses his personal experiences to intuitively ground the sometimes complex logic underlying the experimental tasks he discusses (e.g., transitive inference). His chapter 3 on animal reasoning is closest to his own research and by far the books best. Unfortunately, the book is peppered with minor errors (especially regarding genetics and biology), none of them egregious alone but troubling in their accumulation. Worse, the coverage of studies is spotty, with many directly relevant studies remaining uncited (e.g., regarding animals number abilitiessee Hauser [2000] for a better overview). Wynne sometimes presents arguments as novel (e.g., regarding theory of mind in chimpanzees) that his opponents have both considered and refuted. This book is an inadequate introduction for a scientist seeking a balanced overview of animal cognition.</p>
      <p>Is the book perhaps more suitable for a lay reader? Wynne provides a useful antidote to some uncritical anthropomorphic attitudes and extravagant claims about animal minds that are common in popular culture and the media, but sometimes his case is weaker than necessary: regarding dolphin language, Wynne presents a largely irrelevant discussion of dolphin sexuality rather than citing Bastians careful studies searching for and failing to find evidence for openended vocal communication in dolphins (Evans and Bastian 1969). Although he correctly stresses the preliminary state of current scientific knowledge, he usually offers his personal conclusions, which are sometimes at variance with current consensus in the field, nonetheless. His propensity to dismiss scientists with whom he disagrees via strawman arguments or oneliners makes him an unreliable guide to this sometimes disputatious field. With more careful factchecking and a more balanced treatment of the work of other scholars, Wynnes book would have provided a lively introduction to animal cognition, but as it stands I cannot recommend it strongly.</p>
      <p>Turning to animal rights, Wynnes treatment of these important issues is deeply unsatisfactory. He is certainly correct that current scientific data on animal cognition provide an important starting point for debate about animal rights, but by glibly dismissing arguments of scholars with different opinions he fails to engage in the debate in a serious, useful manner. Most egregious is his treatment of the ethicist Peter Singer, whose 1975 book galvanized the animal rights movement and helped spark farreaching changes in contemporary animal experimentation (Singers arguments have had less influence on the meat industry, where unnecessary animal suffering is still distressingly common). Although I disagree with some of Singers conclusions, his basic argument is quite simple and, I think, nearly irrefutable: animals can suffer, and we have a moral responsibility to minimize that suffering. Although novel and controversial in 1975, today this argument provides the ethical pillar upon which scientifically acceptable treatment of experimental animals stands. The case that all vertebrates suffer pain if they are injured is far stronger than Wynne allows. Singer based this claim not simply on evidence of behaviour (e.g., screaming when injured or avoiding noxious stimulation) which Wynne deems subjective and unreliable (p. 239) but also on neuroscientific evidence that Wynne leaves unmentioned. The neurotransmitters signaling tissue damage, the fiber types conveying this information, and the neural centers processing pain information are shared, virtually identically, among all vertebrates. So is the efficacy of anesthetics that block pain signals, causing a cessation of pain avoidance. Given these unquestioned scientific findings, it is as perverse to deny that other animals feel pain as to deny this of our fellow humans. Wynne does not acknowledge the force of this evidence or its essential acceptance by the modern scientific community.</p>
      <p>Wynnes misrepresents Singers core argument to support his personal conclusion that the concept of animal rights is as silly as the concept of rights for paintings or other inanimate objects. According to Wynne, rights imply responsibilities, which in turn imply comprehension, which requires language and selfawareness that animals do not have. Therefore, no language means no responsibilities means no rights. Fair enoughbut Wynne incorrectly claims that Singer ignores this (rather obvious) argument when in fact Singer convincingly refutes it. We do not have to claim that animals are moral <italic>agents </italic>to recognize their suffering as moral <italic>patients</italic> and, more important, to recognize our responsibility (as humans who are moral agents) to avoid causing such suffering unnecessarily. Wynnes observation is no more relevant to Singers arguments than a human childs lack of moral responsibility is to its basic human rights.</p>
      <p>Noting the absence of any agreedupon system by which we can perform the complicated calculus needed to ensure that our actions toward animals do indeed lead to a minimization of pain (p. 238), Wynne then claims that without a quantitative moral calculus we cannot reckon whether animal research is justified. But the lack of a moral calculus provides no more justification for causing or ignoring unnecessary animal suffering than for excusing cruelty to humans, where a lack of a quantitative ethical system is considered no impediment. Today, both funding and publication of scientific research require scrutiny by ethics boards that carefully assess whether the research can be justified by expected gains and scrupulously reject proposals that would cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to animals. No calculus is required.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, I agree with many of Wynnes conclusions in this book, in particular his conclusion that animals lack a flexible, openended system comparable to human language for mutually communicating their thoughts. But surely an animals ability to <italic>communicate</italic> suffering linguistically is irrelevant to its capacity to <italic>experience</italic> suffering and thus to the moral responsibilities such potential suffering entails for humans. Wynnes simplistic ethical arguments do a disservice not only to the field of animal cognition and to thoughtful ethicists like Singer but to the scientific establishment in general, which has vastly improved its ethics since 1975, thanks in part to the clarity and logic of Singers arguments. Careful, rigorous research on animal cognition should play an important role in future debates concerning animal ethics, but careful, rigorous ethical reasoning is equally critical if we, as scientists and as society, are to make further progress toward the ethical treatment of animals. Wynnes book elides rather than engaging with these deeper issues.</p>
