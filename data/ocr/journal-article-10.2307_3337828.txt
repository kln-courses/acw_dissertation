<plain_text><page sequence="1">subsistence economy of the Ijo in the Niger Delta between the eighth and the eighteenth centuries of the common era. Some material objects known to have fea- tured in this economy have not survived in the currently available archaeological record. This is why-apart from archae- ology-ethnography, oral traditions, and environmental data serve as useful sources for reconstruction. Both the nature of resource integration at the local level and patterns of exchange at a wider level must be considered. The procuring of food was an essen- tial feature of Niger Delta economies during the period under discussion. In the saltwater mangrove swamps of the Eastern Delta (occupied by the Ijo sub- groups of Okrika, Bonny, Kalabari, and Nembe), the economy consisted mainly of fishing and salt production; making pottery, thatch, basketry, cordage, and mats; and trading. Given the sensitive nature of the Delta ecology, understand- ing the nature of and relationships be- tween the various aquatic and other resources in the immediate ecosystem were, and continue to be, crucial to their responsible exploitation and utilization. Religious and other cultural practices have in fact often evolved as a means to promote the regeneration of resources. Shell middens reveal much about diet and food-gathering practices. They were used-for example, among the Okrika- usually near the waterfront and were essentially accumulations of household refuse assembled over long periods of time from neighboring compounds. In the excavations at Onyoma, Ke, Saikiri- pogu, Ogoloma, Okochiri, Nama Sii, and the limited rescue excavation at Old Finima, Nzewunwa sampled and ana- lyzed shell middens (1988:200-11). The middens contained various shell- fish species (including cockles, periwin- kles, whelks, oysters, and clams), pottery, animal and fish bones, charcoal, palm kernels, metal, objects, and fragments of burnt clay. Land mammals whose bones were excavated at Ogoloma include goats, cows, royal antelope, leopards, dogs, ele- phants, cats, and waterbuck. The bones of aquatic mammals have been identified as manatee and hippopotamus. A fish bone was determined to be that of an angler fish (Lophins piscatoris). Nzewunwa correlated the mammal- ian bones from the Ogoloma site with the depths of the spit levels at which they were found (1988:207). In excavation unit IA, for example, at a depth of 80-100 cen- timeters (at level 5)-where European factory-made smoking pipes began to displace locally made versions-goat, cow, and antelope bones were recovered. Of the six goats identified between levels 1 and 21 (the latter ending at 420 cm), two came from levels 1 to 6, while four came from levels 10 to 21. Thus the first two date from the nineteenth century and the remaining four from a period between the fourteenth and about the eighteenth century. From between levels 23 and 24 (which ends at 480 cm), the highest bone weight appears, 1,630 grams, represent- ing a royal antelope and a leopard. The presence of the manatee and the hip- popotamus in the lower levels of the stratigraphic profile at the Ogoloma site c is also significant. Whereas the goat, dog, cow, and cat are domesticated, the ante- lope, leopard, elephant, waterbuck, man- atee, and hippopotamus must be hunted. Fishing was also very important in the economies of the Eastern Delta Ijo groups. Although no fishing gear was recovered from archaeological excava- tions, ethnographic information and oral tradition clearly indicate that a variety of fishing methods were employed. Many of these did not change significantly dur- ing the period under consideration, although the materials used and the structure of some equipment evolved over time. Nets, traps, hooks, and fish poisons were all part of the repertoire. Similarly, various forms of traps and spears, as well as other equipment and methods, were used in hunting both on land and sea in the Delta during the peri- od under review. The methods remained virtually the same until the Europeans introduced the flint gun. The food sources discussed thus far provided protein, but they constituted only part of the diet of the Delta peoples, as indicated by ethnographic information. Indeed, while shellfish were a very impor- tant source of protein, for all their ubiqui- ty they seem to have played a subsidiary role in the diet of the Ijo of the saltwater Eastern Delta. Even today, the various shellfish and crayfish are used more typi- cally as condiments than as primary pro- tein sources in the soup that is used to eat garri (cassava flour) or pounded yam. Thus, although differential preservation has made it impossible to recover vegetal remains during archaeological excava- tions in the Delta, data drawn from ethnography and oral traditions show that the bulk of the diet was composed of car- bohydrates. If peoples in the Eastern Delta did not do much, if any, farming, how did they obtain the yams, cocoyams, plan- tains, cassava, fruits, and vegetables that were the basis of their diet? This brings us to the significance of the freshwater Central Delta in the subsistence economy of the saltwater Eastern Delta peoples. Unlike the saltwa- ter mangrove swamps, the freshwater swamps of the Central Delta contain very large islands, such as Wilberforce, with ample land for farming. Further, ethnographic evidence shows that spe- cies of yam, oil palm trees, and raffia palms grew wild in the Central Delta. For example, the Kolokuma and Gbarain who inhabit this area have been both fishermen and farmers and have long grown crops such as yams, various veg- etables, and pepper. Introduced later, plantains, cocoyams, and cassava have also become staples.l Evidence from the excavations at Agadagbabou, Koroama, ... 0 I o w Ir 0 0 82 5.

Among my favorites was a fabulous hairdresser using a large comb and scissors to cut a seated client's hair; not only could he move his implements together but he could also turn his head and wink. Another favorite showed two men fighting over a woman, each pulling one of the woman's arms back and forth. The men could bend backward and forward, and when they pulled hard, the woman was suspended in mid-air. A last favorite was a man on a tele- phone; he could move both arms so that while holding the phone to his ear, he could gesture with his other arm. This telephone mask was also on the cover of the catalogue. Although the extremely full and lively installation took a few moments to get used to, the result gave the viewer a sense of the ener- gy potential, or ashe, of a Gelede festival. The clutter of masks transformed the gallery space into a highly charged performance space of moving masks and rotating bases which evoked a surprisingly welcome feeling of the cose crowds and bustling activity of west Africa. The performative ambience of the exhi- bition design was due, in part, to the fact that the exhibition designer, Roel Schneeman, has a strong background in theatrical set design. "World in Motion" successfully maintained the Afrika Museum's newly recognized repu- tation for "risk-taking" (Roberts 2000:80).

HOLLYWOOD ICONS, LOCAL DEMONS Ghanaian Popular Paintings by Mark Anthony Belger Arts Center University of Missouri-Kansas City Kansas City, Missouri August-October 27, 2000 Reviewed by Elisabeth L. Cameron Upon entering the gallery at the UMKC Belger Arts Center, I was greeted-and almost over- whelmed-by large colorful paintings combin- ing both exotic and well-known imagery. As I began to go through "Hollywood Icons," attempting to decipher the stories portrayed and the images presented, I was intrigued by how the familiar and the unusual began to swap places. As a fairly new resident in the Midwest, I had not expected to see such provocative con- temporary African art displayed in a local Kansas City gallery. The exhibition became for me both an introduction to the culture of the Midwest and a glimpse of a kind of African art that is usually seen only by Ghanaians. The aptly titled "Hollywood Icons, Local Demons: Ghanaian Popular Paintings by Mark Anthony" featured eighteen paintings that averaged six feet high by seven feet wide. The size and the combination of image and writing made it feel like an exhibition of bizarre road- side billboards-the type you would pull over on 1-35 to get a better look at. "Billboard" is an appropriate description, since these works are used in Ghana to advertise concert parties, all- night events that combine music, comedic performances, and a multiple-act play with a moral. Portraying typically three to five scenes from the plays, the paintings travel with the musicians and actors as they move from town to town. Upon arrival, troupe members strate- gically place them around town to lure people to the performance. To make these oversize paintings transportable, the artist makes them in two sections connected with hinges. They can then be folded and tossed on and off trucks-and they show the wear from this use and abuse. All the examples in this exhibition were cre- ated by Mark Anthony, an outstanding artist who lives in the town of Swedru, Ghana. His early work included murals for bars, sign painting, and paintings on the sides of small passenger vans ("mammy trucks"). By the time the companion exhibition catalogue was writ- ten, however, he was devoting nearly all his time to concert-party paintings, and his works were reputed to increase attendance at the all- night events. During the twentieth century this type of painting became integrated into the arts of the communities, and instead of going to a European-run academic art school, Anthony was able to apprentice with his father. The exhibition consists of sets of paintings for four different plays: When a Royal Dies, We Take Him Home; Some Rivalries Are Dangerous; If You Do Not Allow Your Brother to Climb; and The Judgement Day. The playwrights often base their plays on well-known stories that nevertheless explore current issues. Of partic- ular interest are tales that reflect the social pressures brought about by rapid change and globalization. Each set portrays key, startling, or bizarre scenes from the plays, designed to attract attention and promote discussion as people walk or ride by. The theme of The Judgement Day is familiar to both Americans and Ghanaians: a church leader uses Satanic powers to draw a large fol- lowing and then, on Judgement Day, is claimed by Satan. The three paintings illustrat- ing this tale are perhaps the easiest for a Midwestern audience to decipher. In the first, the minister stands in the pulpit looking out over his congregation, most of whom are steal- ing, embracing, or sleeping. The second shows an angel protecting a saint from Satan, here portrayed as a furry black beast with wings, 85</page><page sequence="3">$1.20 per word, minimum $30. African Arts box number $15.
