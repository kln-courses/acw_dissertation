A Study of Alchemical Symbolism in Goethe's Literary and Scientific Works. By RONALD D. GRAY. Cambridge: University Press. 1952. x+312 pp. 35s. The thesis of this monograph is that 'Goethe was profoundly influenced throughout his life by the religious and philosophical beliefs he derived from his early study of alchemy' (p. ix). Like most theses, it is so incautiously formulated that it automatically challenges contradiction; unlike them, however, it is so admirably sustained-that is, the importance of 'Alchemical Symbolism in Goethe's Literary and Scientific Works' is so convincingly demonstrated-that the author's positing of an alchemical derivation of religious and philosophical beliefs soon ceases to be disturbing to the reader. One may doubt whether alchemy was 'the form in which [Goethe] first encountered neo-Platonism' (p. ix), if only because he was in his twentieth year, with three years of university study behind him, when von Klet- tenberg introduced him to von Welling's Opus Mago-Cabbalisticum et Theosophicum in the winter of 1768-9. But one can hardly fail to be persuaded that Hermetism furnished Goethe with many specific symbols for expressing neo-Platonic views and other of his beliefs in a seemingly objective concrete form and that it provided him with an understanding of mystics and mysticism which he continued to utilize in his literary works throughout the remainder of his life. The parallels between the symbols of alchemical writers known to Goethe (Chapter I: Alchemy), and between those of the Pietistically important Boehme (Chapter II: Jacob Boehme and Alchemy), and those of Goethe's literary, epistolary, autobiographical and natural- scientific writings are too numerous and too close to represent mere coincidence. Particularly persuasive and illuminating is the third chapter of this monograph, 'From Alchemy to Science', which explains more plausibly than any of the best- known accounts of Goethe the Thinker or Goethe the Scientist the actual direction which Goethe's later studies of anatomy, plant forms, colour, geology and meteoro- logy took: despite a conscious repudiation of the arbitrary methods of symbolical science (alchemy), Goethe continued to let his intuitive belief in the oneness of all the realms of Nature, the inspiration of empirical observations far more objective than those of alchemists, physiognomists or 'Naturphilosophen', decide the im- portance of his discoveries or determine the final formulation of his general theories. The chapters which treat these discoveries and theories (iv, v and vi) constitute an excellent survey of Goethe's scientific interests; despite the monograph's thesis, they are not overburdened with alchemical parallels and yet still contain sufficient evidence to substantiate convincingly the argument that Goethe, consciously or unconsciously, used alchemical-symbolical patterns extensively in connexion with these interests. In later chapters the author offers new light on Goethe's Mdrchen, discusses the symbol of the centre ('Centre and Circle') in various works (although without insisting too much that it is to be thought of as exclusively alchemical), offers a somewhat predominantly alchemical interpretation of Homunculus, and finally traces through his writings and as primarily alchemical in its origin the symbol of the hermaphrodite-including the 'Amazon'-as an expression of Goethe's desire</page><page sequence="2">102 Reviews to synthesize all opposition. The reviewer, perhaps because he is more familiar with Goethe's poetic works than with his other writings, thought these last chapters to be on the whole more tangential and less persuasive than those which preceded them: to focus too exclusively on survivals of Hermetism in Goethe's poetry is almost certainly to see distortedly any one poetic work. In illustration of this incidental stricture the author's remarks on Vermichtnis (pp. 197, 248-9) may be adduced, a poem of which it is asserted that 'the circling of the earth and moon about the sun reveals to man the need to turn about his own inward sun and centre', that when this centre is founld 'past and present become joined in the "eternal moment": '"Dann ist Vergangenheit bestandig, / Das Kiinftige voraus lebendig, / Der Augenblick ist Ewigkeit"'. Both the Copernican discovery and the Kantian one are in this poem separate illustrations of eternal 'Gesetze' which in one sense make it correct to assert 'Kein Wesen kann zu Nichts zerfallen !'. A no less important condition of recognizing the 'eternal moment' is ability 'den Sinnen zu trauen', and a still higher achievement is penetration with the feeling 'Was fruchtbar ist, allein ist wahr'. Vermdchtnis is, of course, an admirable illustration of alchemical elements in Goethe's thought; they are simply somewhat less explicit in it than the discussion in Goethe the Alchemist implies.' Occasionally one wonders if the author has not attempted to credit directly to alchemy elements in Goethe's writing that simply reflect a widespread transfer of alchemical symbolism to other areas of thought. Is the 'profitable calcination' analysed on p. 24 more than a 'Zerreibung' (cf. Oertel's dictionary, kalcinirt)? Would the 'dezidierter Nicht-Christ' of the early 1770's and thereafter have remained so much under the spell of Christian-symbolic alchemy as is suggested in the last pages of the chapter on Boehme and alchemy? Schiller, who did not dabble in alchemy, was as prone to triadic patterns of development as was Goethe (cf. p. 142), and so it may be doubted that Goethe was 'almost certainly intent on concealing' anything from his contemporaries with his Dichtung und Wahrheit account of his alchemical studies (cf. pp. 48 and 53). Is the anthropomorphism of language in Goethe's botanical writings (cf. p. 81) remarkably different from that of other eighteenth-century naturalists? Is it plausible that Goethe sympathized with the Neptunist theory 'because he saw in it a confirmation of the story of creation in Genesis' (p. 137)? It is revealing that the author finds the parallels between Goethe's geological writings and alchemical literature 'not as close as one could wish' (p. 144), only to go on to imply that Goethe's use of 'Schrack' for 'tremor' may derive from Pietistic alchemy (p. 145). Is Faust 1. 11985 clarified by explaining 'Flocken' botanically? Certainly the Emperor in Faust is not thinking of any ' noment', let alone of 'one universal movement of male to female, earth to heaven' (p. 158), when he speaks the words here cited: 'Womit der obern sich die Interwelt, / In Einigkeit begliickt, zusammenstellt' (cf. 11. 6137 if.). As for the theory that Faust's descent to the Mothers represents his discovery of a new 'centre of life' (pp. 200-4)-it is merely another example of the regrettable tendency to read Faust II as an allegory.2 The same tendency weakens the dis- cussion of Homunculus in the otherwise very illuminating chapter on the symbol of the hermaphrodite: patent textual evidence to the contrary, Homunculus is treated as primarily 'the creature of Wagner', and Faust's trance becomes symbolic of the death from which by alchemical symbolism the new spirit (a new Faust) is about to be born. If extraneous knowledge of alchemical symbolism is needed to weld 'into a whole what might otherwise appear to be a succession of disconnected 1 Cf. K.

In its larger implications Goethe the Alchemist remains convincing. Well written, intelligently illustrated with three relevant plates and one text-figure, and printed clearly and accurately,' it is an enduring contribution to our understanding of Goethe and his age.

Die neuere deutsche Lyrik vom Barock bis zur Gegenwart. Sonderdruck aus Deutsche Philologie im Aufri/3. By AUGUST CLOSS. Berlin: Erich Schmidt. 1952. 216 columns. M. 7.80. No one will appreciate to the full this challenging book, packed with interest as it is, unless he realizes to begin with that the author is im Asthetischen verankert, as he says of Rilke. It is indeed in the aesthetic handling that the justification lies for what, to a critic anchored in academic pedantry, may seem to be the loose system of arrangement and the strange sense of proportion; what we are given is not a meticulous build-up, with consecutive dates and poet by poet, but a penetra- tive interpretation of the main movements with whatever interrelations there may be, so that there is a broad sweep with concentric waves. But even so there might well have been some consistency in giving dates of birth and death; these seem to have been thrown in sievewise, so that some remain; one can hardly think that Goethe's and Arno Holz's dates are missing because everybody has them pat. Economy of space may explain initials for Christian names; but at first glance one is somewhat surprised by, say, 'H. Hofmannswaldau', 'P. v. d. Aelst', 'S. Dach', 'G. A. Burger', and others. The argument may be that everybody says 'T. S. Eliot'; but does anybody say 'S. Sassoon'? If there were an index one might hunt for a Christian name or a date, as there is a haphazard possibility that it may have tumbled in earlier or later; as it is, the search is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Minor slips of various sorts there are bound to be in a book marked by quick-stroke artistry; thus foreign terms and names may be dubious-apart from wrong French accents, secole di lume and un ceuvre d'art; and Franz Maria Arouet never was Voltaire's name. More intriguing is der Barock, which may be due to confusion of der Barockstil and das Barock. The line said to be quoted from Holderlin, Nur einen (sic) Sommer g6nnt, ihr Gewalten, must have made the com- positors squeal. The title belongs to the broad sweep of the plan: 'neuere' is recent in so far as it is shown that, in existential terminology, the past is the present; Baroque in particular is of our day in tone and spirit; Brockes' description of flowers tallies with that of Weinheber's famous group of poems, Blumenstraup; there is a reference to Holderlin's 'barocke VersfiiBe' (this may not be so clear); there is comparison (to his disadvantage) of Ewald Christian von Kleist's nature poetry with 'A. Holzens naturalistische Naturphotographie'; and Klopstock is classed as a 'Vorlaufer A. Holzens'. The definition of Baroque as 'eine wuchtige Straffung bauschiger Breite' is rather stunning, but the definition as it pans out is generally helpful. It is a pity, however, that etymological conjecture as to the root meaning of the term is omitted; for, after all, it belongs to 'modern' interpretation of terms 'to drag out meaning from the roots', as Otto zur Linde put it. Schiefrund is more vivid than Scotch pearls, and music might come in-today one is told that, while 1 Two misprints noted were 'ernary' for 'ternary' (p. 40) and 'vieierlei' (p. 273, ch. iv, n. 1).</page></plain_text>
