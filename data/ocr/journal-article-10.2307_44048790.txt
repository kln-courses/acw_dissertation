We are, all of us, so continually called upon to de- scribe our experiences, - conversation consists so largely in the exchange of observations, - that we do not realize in otdinary life how complex and difficult a thing observation is. True, we have been told the story of Eves and ~Ķo Eyes; we assent, if our assent is asked, to the statement that the botanist and the en- tomologist see far more in nature than we ourselves can see; we may have come across Huxley's remark that "there is not one person in a hundred who can describe the commonest occurrence with even an ap- proach to accuracy/' and accepted it as correct. But this is all in the intellectual sphere: I do not think that many people feel their inaccuracy, have a warm and lively sense of their untrustworthiness. That can come only by training under conditions which shall make the difficulties of observation glaringly manifest; e. g., by work in science, where a slovenly or inadequate record is "shown up," mercilessly, in the results of experiment. Nevertheless, a very short and easy excursion into psychology will suffice to bring some of the salient ' facts home to us. Let the reader try to recall the state of the weather for the past fourteen days; let him draw a ground plan of his native town, or of the schcblhouse, which he knew so well, and in which he moved with such automatic precision; nay, let him leave the room in which he is now sitting, and, in an- other room, make out an inventory of its furniture and decoration, noting down the pattern of wall-paper and carpet, the arrangement of books and pictures; or, if he be used to handling a. typewriter, let him write out the order of letters and signs on the key-board, of the instrument. He will be nothing less than amazed at the outcome. . Certain things, certain facts, will stand ouť with â vigorous insistence; the rest of the picture will be an uncertain haze. Blurs, omissions, sheer mistakes, will occur in what seems an unac- countable manner. So we are led to our first conclu- sion: that untrained observation is always selective observation. Some events are "naturally" observed; others, as naturally, pass unobserved (1). Let us, now, set ourselves a task of observation; let us make an effort to note the whole of some phe- nomenon. We have, perhaps, a roomful' of people. Let some member otf the company leave the room; then let him enter again, and go through a series of movements which are to be observed by all present; when the action is completed, let everyone write dçwn what he has seen. Or- to reduce the problem to still lower terms - let an outline figure be drawn on a blackboard, and, after some seconds' contemplation, be wiped out, and reproduced on paper by the specta- tors. In both cases the diversity of result will be sur- prising. Each one sees, not simply what is there to see, but what is there as it is modified by association, by the observer's past experience. As experience has been, so will observation be. The tale is told of a boy, shown a budding yeast-plant under the micro- scope, who informed his father that the doctor had helped him to see a little bit of a goat on glass! Some chance resemblance, some analogy of fancy, had outweighed the direct information given. But the adult is led astray by association, no less than the child. And so we come to a second point; that even when we are interested to observe, when we have selected something for observation, we do not observe accurately. The subjective colors the objective; the trend of our mind determines, in large measure, the matter of observation. ^ ' Observation, then, the unbiased and reliablé de- scription of things experienced, is an idéal that can be realized only by careful training, involving pains and labor. It implies patience, resoluteness, self-sacrifice. And the reason that we are not more acutely aware of this is simply the fact that we are rarely called to ac- count for what we narrate in everyday life. I have been led to pen these remarks by the reading of some of the recent literature of nature study. It is proposed to introduce nature study even into the kindergarten; from the time that they are taught any- thing, children are to be taught the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Now, that the kindergarten as it is exists far more for the sake of the teacher thjan for that of tlier child; and that the "or- thodox'' kindergarten teaching is largely wrong; these are truisms, which will be granted by all save those who are hopelessly committed to the system (2). And if nature study in the kindergarten means, say, the physical geography of the sand-pile, worked out . with spade and bucket, then I am strongly in favor of it. My own kindergarten ideal is that of disciplined play alternating with play undisciplined. But if nature study means discriminative work, the work of comparing, noting minute differences, classifying,- if it means work that demands nice muscular co-ordina- tion, such as the drawing of leaves,- if it means work that requires continuance of observation, sustained interest, - then I am sure that it is out of place. Above all, the "whole truth" about plants ,and ani- mals must not be allowed to displace myth and fairy- tale, Why not? Because these stories are normal and natural to the human being in the first stages ' of his development. Science itself assures us of this: most of our Teutonic fairy-tales are, as Professor Karl Pearson has convincingly shown (3), couched in terms of the matriarchate; and the young child,, so far as it is in its own right a member of any community, is a, member óf a matriarchal community. Another' (1.) The psychological reasons for this selectiveness are set forth in my "Primer of Psychology," 1898, pp. 76 ff. (2.) In the report of a ìecent discussion on education, I find the fol- lowing sentiment attributed to a prominent kindergartner ( sit venia verbo !) : « The child has more to teach the teacher than the teacher lias for the child." For an indictment of kindergarten methods, see Development of the CW14," 1898. ch. V. (8, j Oí. " Tfce CJwnoe» of Deatfo, and Qfter Eps&amp;Fi," 1897. reason ? Because fairy-tales serve to develop the child's sense of humor, as the "whole truth" cannot do; and the Anglo-Saxon race, despite the "Pickwick Papers" and "The Tramp Abroad," is woefully deficient in humor. Matter-of- factness, commonplaceness, is one of our besetting sins. Another reason? Because these fairy tales are a part of our folk-heritage; they permeate our litera- ture, and season ^our serious thinking. Will any man who has known them confess a willingness to give them up? Would any man willingly miss the count- less allusions to them, in poetry and prose, that are scattered through the length and breadth of English literature? I trow not. And there is yet another reason: the fact that, try to write the whole truth as you may, you cannot escape the atmosphere of fairy- land, the "anthropomorphism" of it, if we must have a scientific word. I have been reading a leaflet on the life history of the toad, written by a naturalist of high standing, and intended for pupils who have far out- grown the kindergarten. I find the following sen- tences: "What queer feelings the little toad must have when the soft, smooth bottom of the pond and the pretty plants, and the water that supported.it so nicely, are all to be left behind for the hard, rough, drv land! . . . The little toad is very brave ... it is also careful. ... If it were foolish as well as brave, it might1 be filled with vanity and stay out in the sun till it dried up." The toad of fairy-land may appre- ciate the beauty of plants, and succumb to the emotion of vanity. But if we are in search of truth, we must not do such violence as this to genetic psychology. Our life-history becomes ä pseudo fairy-tale, and we have, unawares, spiced our dish with the very condi- ment that we thought unwholesome. I for one, then, desire no nature study, if (as Chaucer says) it "makith that ther ben no fayeries." Further : I can see objection to nature study be- yond the limits of the kindergarten. As, for instance, that it brings too prominently forward the notion of interest, to the overshadowing of the notion of dis- cipline. The pendulum has swung from teaching by authority to teaching by pleasure. I doubt whether, just now, it has not traveled too far in the latter direc- tion. Again, I think that there is some danger, in offering a "taste of everything" to the pupil, that we fall back towards the old idea of a curriculum, a smattering of all sorts of subjects, with njo thorough knowledge of any. And this is the very thing that the "elective system" has been designed to avoid. Again, I fear that, in the effort to smooth the road of learning, we may not, after all, be quite fair to our pupils. For science is not nature study. Science rs, for several years of the student's life, drudgery,- hard, steady, unremitting, uninteresting work at the orthography and etymology and syntax of nature; very different from the "marvelous" and "fascinat- ing" and "wonderful" things of nature study.,. Science is a hard mistress, and her rewards come late. And yet again, even if nature study be desirable, have we sufficiently educated our teachers, the teachers who teach and the teachers who write? For example, I find no single reference, in the leaflet just mentioned, to the mechanism of sexual reproduction. Now an intelligent child is sure to ask the question: Where do the eggs come from? And, if he seeks the toads in their native haunts (as he is advised to do), he will surely come upon scores of coupled animals in the breeding season; questions will arise here too. The teacĶer should be informed by the writer how such questions are to be met; or, rather, the general topic should be ventilated and discussed, and a conclusion arrived at, before • either teaching or writing is attempted. To come back to my original text: observation is not easy. It is by no means self-evident that one should seek to induce the habit of observation, an attitude of the adult scientific mind, upon the im- mature organism. It is by no means certain that, endeavoring to modify the difficulties of observation for the pupils of primary sehpols, we arp mot losing</page><page sequence="2">268 JÖT JÎtîXJ^Îu OF !E D TT CELTIO IST.

There are two proverbs, a Greek and a E oman, that may well find applica t ion here. The one enjoins us to bewrare of excess, - "Nothing too much," it runs; the other bids us make haste slowly. These two proverbs, indeed, constitute the hinge upon which all that I have written in this Journal turns. In my first paper I tried to show that what is needed for teaching is a theory of education - not a Herbartian theory, or a Hegelian theory, or a Spen- cerian theory, but a theory that shall include all these and more besides. In my second paper, I pointed out that what seemed at first sight to be a, very simple problem (the discovery of a test of mental fatigue) lias attracted the attention of several competent en- quirers, that the method of approaching it has filtered through several minds, and that, nevertheless, there is still work to be done before a satisfactory conclu- sion is reached. In the present paper, I have sought to prove that the benefits of nature study are not so obvious and undeniable as has been supposed. I should, however, fail of my purpose, if I wrought nothing but discouragement in the mind of the reader. He must remember that the scientific man aims to know, the practical man to do. The former will always be keen to see faults and imperfections in a scheme of action; the latter will be prone to act before the time is ripe. Safety lies in a compromise between the two extremes, - in the something which is not too much, and in the progress which is not too hurried.</page></plain_text>
