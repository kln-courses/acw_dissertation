   <page sequence="1"> Akhenaten:  New Theories and Old Facts* Donald B. Redford Arguably the first five years, the “Karnak” period, of Akhenaten’s reign constitute the most im- portant time span in the formulation of the heretic king’s program. In contrast to the 18 years  spent at Amarna, for which textual evidence dwindles drastically, the first half-decade of reign  yields an abundance of inscriptional and epigraphic remains with which to chart both the polit- ical and cultic evolution of the king’s thought. The focus here is on the sequence of events in the   Theban years, the roots of the king’s thought and iconoclasm, his rejection of symbolism, and his  introduction of what has been called “monotheism.” Between the expulsion of the Hyksos and the acces- newly conquered to the victors as that of mrt, “lower class sion of Akhenaten, Egypt experienced two major labor” (Urk.

   <page sequence="10"> 18 DONALD B . REDFORD BASOR 369 It is important to note that in Parennefer’s depiction  of the pr-ἰtn, we have the earliest stage in the layout of  this new installation .34 Nowhere in the tomb does the  term Gm-p3-ἰtn occur, so closely associated with the  sd-festival (D . B . Redford 1994) . The sun-god is still de- picted in his anthropomorphic form, and the “didactic”  name has yet to be enclosed in cartouches . The rows of  kiosks, designated as the “court of the Great Ones” (D . B .  Redford 1973: 80; ATP 1: 62), required for the jubilee,  are also missing . A fragment of raised relief does, admit- tedly, show the piers of the great court, but with columns  of texts yielding the didactic name of the Disc followed  by the double cartouche of the king; the addorsed co- lossoi (Manniche 2010) of the Gm-p3-ἰtn phase are no- where in evidence (Fig. 6c) .35 There can, in fact, be no  dissent from the obvious conclusion that the north wall  of Parennefer’s tomb shows the pr-ἰtn in the second year,  before it was transformed into the Gm-p3-ἰtn . It must have been coincident with the decision to de- vote East Karnak to the Disc that a new size of masonry  unit was adopted . It was relatively small, 52 cm long on  average, and portable by a single individual—I myself  have carried such a block . Modernly called talatat*, the  Egyptian term may be vouchsafed in a happily surviving  text which mentions “sand  .  .  . [  .  .  . ] all those related  functions [  .  .  . ] stone bricks” (121-8, Fig. 7) . The decision to found the pr-ἰtn and the run-up to the  sd-festival would also have been the terminus a quo for  the selection of personnel and the stocking of the new  installation .

   <page sequence="11"> 2013 AKHENATEN: NEW THEORIES AND OLD FACTS 19 Before that time came, however, Akhenaten, per- haps in a burst of naive enthusiasm born of his revela- tion, purposed to publish the Disc’s cult throughout the  realm . Shrines to the new god were begun in a few major  locations;42 but every temple received an altar and offer- ing stand for offerings to the Disc (Saad and Manniche  1971: pl . 21; see also our 1952-2, Fig. 2) .43 Even in the  south, the African province of Egypt’s empire, Akhenaten  felt obliged to promote his father and his worship by in- augurating, modifying, and destroying .44 The Reign of Akhenaten, Phase 3:  The First Jubilee The insistence on year 2 as the time span for Phase 2  arises out of the date of Akhenaten’s sd-festival . All the  evidence militates in favor of the kaleidoscope of revo- lutionary changes associated with Akhenaten’s program  having taken place at his jubilee, or in anticipation  thereof . This includes the new style of art, the new, out- landish representation of the king, the first steps in overt  iconoclasm, the introduction of the Disc as an icon, and  the enclosing of the didactic name in cartouches (1415- 7L, Figs. 3, 9),45 with the added epithet “who is in jubi- lee .” The linen from the tomb of Tutankhamun shows  Fig. 8.

It was at this time that the pr-ἰtn, stretching all the  way from (and encompassing) “the great palace” on the  west to the Re-Harakhty altar on the east, was developed  in its final stage .48 The additions to the temple (now  named Gm[t]-p3-ἰtn) included (1) decorating the walls  of the pierced portico with brightly painted reliefs of the  sd-festival (D . B . Redford 1984: 102–4); (2) introducing  statuary into the first court, colossal sandstone figures  on the south half of the great court set against the piers  (Manniche 2010), and life-size, red quartzite statues in  the northern half (Redford et al . 1991: 87–88; 1174-6,  Fig. 8);49 (3) inserting altars of granite, probably one in  front of each statue, carved with the name of the Disc,  the king, and the queen (Fig. 10);50 (4) transforming the  first court into the equivalent of the itr.ty by construct- ing a series of open-roofed shrines (“the Court of the  Great Ones”) (D . B . Redford 1977: 31 n . 68) . It is uncer- tain how much renovation was expended on the palace  itself (see below) . The talatat scenes often contain depic- tions of pylons with columned texts of offering menus  (ATP 1: pls . 56–57); but it is not entirely clear whether  these gates front a palace or temple . The former might  suggest itself in that the palace apartments are shown in  close proximity . Other components of the palace include  46 The sd-festival was tied to the date of the accession (LdÄ 5: 784);  the announcement of a coming performance was made about a year in  advance, and the gods began to assemble four weeks before the anniver- sary of the accession: cf . the case of Ramesses III, accession ix .26 (KRI  V: 143); assembly year 29, viii .28 (Gardiner 1948: 55:15–16) . 47 One talatat may contain a reference to this authorization: “rest- ing in the [te]mple (ḥwt-nṯr), [  .  .  . ] the House of the Disc, [  .  .  . ] giving  instructions [  .  .  . ]” (1493-7; see Fig . 9) . 48 Parennefer did not include any of the upgraded features of the  temple in his wall scenes .

This 18th Dynasty  structure had a gate to the west and a large space (or  courtyard) within which crowds could gather or tribute  in bulk could be received by the king . The presence of  crowds at Akhenaten’s jubilee—how many were normally  admitted?—feasting outside the palace, both within and  without the colonnade fronting the Window of Appear- ances, conforms admirably to the postulate of wide open  grounds bordering the palace and given over to such  gala events . Now the feasters in these scenes are shown  in several rows, squatting, each before a low tray laden  with food, facing the Window in the palace facade, and  introduced by standing officers (ATP 1: pls . 63–64, 82:4) .  A block containing the back and part of the wig of the  last squatting man in one of the rows shows him backed  up against an architectural feature depicting a head-smit- ing scene (ATP 1: pl . 23:3) .

   <page sequence="20"> 28 DONALD B . REDFORD BASOR 369 not lay stress on the colorless s3 Rʿ and the like, but  rather devises new and imaginative jargon to provide  a multidimensional characterization of his descent . He  was p3 šry nfr n p3 ἰtn, “the beautiful little boy of the  Disc,” conveying the nuance of innocence, immaturity,  and dependence; s3.k pr m ḥʿw.k, (to the Disc) “thy son  who has emerged from thy limbs” (Sandman 1938: 54:2,  75:12, 78:1, 96:1–2); s3.k wʿ pr m ẖt.k, “unique son who  emerged from thy body” (Sandman 1938: 76:7–8); s3  nḥḥ pr m ἰtn, “eternal son who emerged from the Disc”  (Sandman 1938: 59:16) . Extending the trope, he enjoyed  a constant rebirth through the rays of his father:80 p3y.k  šri pr m stwt.k (to the Disc) “thy little boy who emerged  from thy rays” (Sandman 1938: 59:12, 91:1); msy.k ḥm.f  mi msy.k tw rʿ nb bn irt 3bw, ḳd.n.k šw m stwt.k ḏs.k,  “thou hast given birth to His Majesty as thou givest birth  to thyself daily, without let-up, when thou has fashioned  him with thine own rays” (Sandman 1938: 75:14–15; cf .  84:14, 91:3) . This fixation with rays of light as instrumental in  daily birth and rejuvenation betokens naught but an ex- tended metaphor, not a mystic signifier . A “sun-beam”  in Akhenaten’s jargon is nothing but a “script pointer”  (Schank and Abelson 1977: 47) alerting us to a constella- tion of rhetorical figures, not tenets of belief . Of course,  “light” is going to play a pivotal role—what else does the  Disc produce?—but to call Akhenaten’s doctrine a “Re- ligion of Light” is to mistake a concomitant for the core  of the system .81 The centerpiece of Akhenaten’s doctrine is his rela- tionship with his father . Only the Disc has conferred the  office (ἰ3t) of kingship on his son on the terrestrial throne:  “thou hast ensconced him in thine office of King of Upper  and Lower Egypt” (Sandman 1938: 75:7–8, 80:1, 59:19);  the Disc is the one “who set him upon his (the Disc’s)  throne” (Urk. IV: 1982:1; cf . 135–11; see Fig. 9), “who Fig. 14. Talatat texts 2126-6 (top left), 118-11 (bottom left), and TS  set him upon the seat of the living Disc who fabricated 8842 part (bottom right)Translation, 2126-6: [him  .  .  . ]” (D . B .

   <page sequence="27"> Akhenaten:  New Theories and Old Facts* Donald B. Redford Arguably the first five years, the “Karnak” period, of Akhenaten’s reign constitute the most im- portant time span in the formulation of the heretic king’s program. In contrast to the 18 years  spent at Amarna, for which textual evidence dwindles drastically, the first half-decade of reign  yields an abundance of inscriptional and epigraphic remains with which to chart both the polit- ical and cultic evolution of the king’s thought. The focus here is on the sequence of events in the   Theban years, the roots of the king’s thought and iconoclasm, his rejection of symbolism, and his  introduction of what has been called “monotheism.” Between the expulsion of the Hyksos and the acces- newly conquered to the victors as that of mrt, “lower class sion of Akhenaten, Egypt experienced two major labor” (Urk. IV: 102:15; 742:13–743:8; Warburton 1997: jolts in her socioeconomic system, never felt be- 272–74), or nḏt, “tenants, dependents” (Urk. IV: 138:9;  fore nor predicted at the time .

In Egypt, it is almost axiomatic that settlement in Egypt (Helck 1971: 342–70; D . B .

   <page sequence="36"> 18 DONALD B . REDFORD BASOR 369 It is important to note that in Parennefer’s depiction  of the pr-ἰtn, we have the earliest stage in the layout of  this new installation .34 Nowhere in the tomb does the  term Gm-p3-ἰtn occur, so closely associated with the  sd-festival (D . B . Redford 1994) . The sun-god is still de- picted in his anthropomorphic form, and the “didactic”  name has yet to be enclosed in cartouches . The rows of  kiosks, designated as the “court of the Great Ones” (D . B .  Redford 1973: 80; ATP 1: 62), required for the jubilee,  are also missing . A fragment of raised relief does, admit- tedly, show the piers of the great court, but with columns  of texts yielding the didactic name of the Disc followed  by the double cartouche of the king; the addorsed co- lossoi (Manniche 2010) of the Gm-p3-ἰtn phase are no- where in evidence (Fig. 6c) .35 There can, in fact, be no  dissent from the obvious conclusion that the north wall  of Parennefer’s tomb shows the pr-ἰtn in the second year,  before it was transformed into the Gm-p3-ἰtn . It must have been coincident with the decision to de- vote East Karnak to the Disc that a new size of masonry  unit was adopted . It was relatively small, 52 cm long on  average, and portable by a single individual—I myself  have carried such a block .

The decision to found the pr-ἰtn and the run-up to the  sd-festival would also have been the terminus a quo for  the selection of personnel and the stocking of the new  installation .

   <page sequence="37"> 2013 AKHENATEN: NEW THEORIES AND OLD FACTS 19 Before that time came, however, Akhenaten, per- haps in a burst of naive enthusiasm born of his revela- tion, purposed to publish the Disc’s cult throughout the  realm . Shrines to the new god were begun in a few major  locations;42 but every temple received an altar and offer- ing stand for offerings to the Disc (Saad and Manniche  1971: pl . 21; see also our 1952-2, Fig. 2) .43 Even in the  south, the African province of Egypt’s empire, Akhenaten  felt obliged to promote his father and his worship by in- augurating, modifying, and destroying .44 The Reign of Akhenaten, Phase 3:  The First Jubilee The insistence on year 2 as the time span for Phase 2  arises out of the date of Akhenaten’s sd-festival . All the  evidence militates in favor of the kaleidoscope of revo- lutionary changes associated with Akhenaten’s program  having taken place at his jubilee, or in anticipation  thereof . This includes the new style of art, the new, out- landish representation of the king, the first steps in overt  iconoclasm, the introduction of the Disc as an icon, and  the enclosing of the didactic name in cartouches (1415- 7L, Figs. 3, 9),45 with the added epithet “who is in jubi- lee .” The linen from the tomb of Tutankhamun shows  Fig. 8.

It was at this time that the pr-ἰtn, stretching all the  way from (and encompassing) “the great palace” on the  west to the Re-Harakhty altar on the east, was developed  in its final stage .48 The additions to the temple (now  named Gm[t]-p3-ἰtn) included (1) decorating the walls  of the pierced portico with brightly painted reliefs of the  sd-festival (D . B . Redford 1984: 102–4); (2) introducing  statuary into the first court, colossal sandstone figures  on the south half of the great court set against the piers  (Manniche 2010), and life-size, red quartzite statues in  the northern half (Redford et al . 1991: 87–88; 1174-6,  Fig. 8);49 (3) inserting altars of granite, probably one in  front of each statue, carved with the name of the Disc,  the king, and the queen (Fig. 10);50 (4) transforming the  first court into the equivalent of the itr.ty by construct- ing a series of open-roofed shrines (“the Court of the  Great Ones”) (D . B . Redford 1977: 31 n . 68) . It is uncer- tain how much renovation was expended on the palace  itself (see below) . The talatat scenes often contain depic- tions of pylons with columned texts of offering menus  (ATP 1: pls . 56–57); but it is not entirely clear whether  these gates front a palace or temple . The former might  suggest itself in that the palace apartments are shown in  close proximity . Other components of the palace include  46 The sd-festival was tied to the date of the accession (LdÄ 5: 784);  the announcement of a coming performance was made about a year in  advance, and the gods began to assemble four weeks before the anniver- sary of the accession: cf . the case of Ramesses III, accession ix .26 (KRI  V: 143); assembly year 29, viii .28 (Gardiner 1948: 55:15–16) . 47 One talatat may contain a reference to this authorization: “rest- ing in the [te]mple (ḥwt-nṯr), [  .  .  . ] the House of the Disc, [  .  .  . ] giving  instructions [  .  .  . ]” (1493-7; see Fig . 9) . 48 Parennefer did not include any of the upgraded features of the  temple in his wall scenes .

He  was p3 šry nfr n p3 ἰtn, “the beautiful little boy of the  Disc,” conveying the nuance of innocence, immaturity,  and dependence; s3.k pr m ḥʿw.k, (to the Disc) “thy son  who has emerged from thy limbs” (Sandman 1938: 54:2,  75:12, 78:1, 96:1–2); s3.k wʿ pr m ẖt.k, “unique son who  emerged from thy body” (Sandman 1938: 76:7–8); s3  nḥḥ pr m ἰtn, “eternal son who emerged from the Disc”  (Sandman 1938: 59:16) . Extending the trope, he enjoyed  a constant rebirth through the rays of his father:80 p3y.k  šri pr m stwt.k (to the Disc) “thy little boy who emerged  from thy rays” (Sandman 1938: 59:12, 91:1); msy.k ḥm.f  mi msy.k tw rʿ nb bn irt 3bw, ḳd.n.k šw m stwt.k ḏs.k,  “thou hast given birth to His Majesty as thou givest birth  to thyself daily, without let-up, when thou has fashioned  him with thine own rays” (Sandman 1938: 75:14–15; cf .  84:14, 91:3) . This fixation with rays of light as instrumental in  daily birth and rejuvenation betokens naught but an ex- tended metaphor, not a mystic signifier . A “sun-beam”  in Akhenaten’s jargon is nothing but a “script pointer”  (Schank and Abelson 1977: 47) alerting us to a constella- tion of rhetorical figures, not tenets of belief . Of course,  “light” is going to play a pivotal role—what else does the  Disc produce?—but to call Akhenaten’s doctrine a “Re- ligion of Light” is to mistake a concomitant for the core  of the system .81 The centerpiece of Akhenaten’s doctrine is his rela- tionship with his father . Only the Disc has conferred the  office (ἰ3t) of kingship on his son on the terrestrial throne:  “thou hast ensconced him in thine office of King of Upper  and Lower Egypt” (Sandman 1938: 75:7–8, 80:1, 59:19);  the Disc is the one “who set him upon his (the Disc’s)  throne” (Urk.
