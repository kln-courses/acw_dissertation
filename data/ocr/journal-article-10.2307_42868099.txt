<plain_text><page sequence="1">Strategies for Change in the Child Client * GARTH J. BLACKHAM Before the elementary counselor can meaningfully consider strategies for change in the child client, he must consider several basic questions. First, does the strategy he wishes to utilize have sufficient theoretical undergirding that be- havior change can be expected or even predicted? Second, is its application consistent with desirable human goals? Third, does the strategy meet the re- quirements of efficiency and effectiveness in situations to which it is applied? And fourth, does its application lead to any negative or unsought consequences? In order to provide appropriate perspective for considering these questions, as well as to think meaningfully about useful strategies, we must consider the elementary counselor's roles and the nature of behavior change. It has been suggested that by the thoughtful implementation of certain roles, the elementary counselor strives to enhance the total learning environment of the school and to assist all children to fulfill their potential. He is developmen- tally oriented rather than crisis-oriented and committed to the task of facilitat- ing healthy development. Such a focus places the elementary school counselor Garth J.

Consequently, the sometimes-ineffective "brush-fire fighting" or after-the-fact counseling is to be eliminated. Presumably, then, the counselor can devote his counseling and con- sultative skill to the goal of self-actualization. Although such statements are commendable, they do not provide much direction, and some are at variance with the evidence. Developmental psychol- ogists (Ausubel, 1958) have recognized for some time that a given culture selects certain potentials for emphasis while others are left relatively unnurtured. De- pending on the cultural goals, beliefs, and value systems of a particular society, some behaviors are early honed and constantly reinforced. Other behaviors, having less instrumental or survival value, have a stunted, incomplete history. Images and concepts of the nature of man differ. And, as the conceptions differ, self-actualization is variously defined (Singer, 1965). The end result, then, is inevitably a compromise between the "human universais," psychological health, and what a particular culture wants. What is clearly required is a definitive specification of the crucial cognitive, affective, and psychomotor tasks and trans- itions that must be navigated for complete, healthy psychological differentiation. Both Havighurst (1953) and Erikson (1959) have made significant contribu- tions in mapping tasks and crises. A more complete mapping, however, is re- quired before counseling becomes truly developmental. The issue of whether the elementary school counselor facilitates normal development or modifies developmental deviation is a relative one. But given certain dynamic conceptions of health it is apparent that few children, if any, are ever in a state of complete equilibrium for long. Conflict, anxiety, and prob- lem-processing are characteristic of the developmental process. It is often diffi- cult to distinguish growth-related normal coping from unhealthy struggles. At the present time, indices of unsuccessful coping in elementary school children, based on a number of studies, vary from 16 to 50 percent (Kaplan, 1959). Facilitative and preventive strategies are obviously important, but many chil- dren come to school with overtly visible and symbolic wounds. Indeed, many dimensions of the behaving system have progressed a long way. Bloom (1964), for example, has suggested that approximately 50 percent of a child's measured intelligence at age 17 is acquired by age 4. The implication of this is simply that the elementary counselor must be prepared to implement a broad array of facilitative, preventive, and change ex-</page><page sequence="3">176 I ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING periences. He becomes, then, a skillful educational engineer and an effective psychological tactician who mobilizes all the resources of the school milieu to shepherd the child through crucial developmental acquisitions. While a portion of his clientele are children, all persons who have significant interpersonal in- fluences on the child may be properly viewed as his clients. The Nature of Behavior Change When we attempt to apply strategies for change in a child client, we are obvious- ly talking about the conditions of behavior change. Yet a systematic theory that explains all behavior change has not been formulated. Traditionally, as Ford and Urban (1963) have suggested, behavior change has been considered from two basic positions. The first is that behavior is learned in order to terminate a con- dition which is noxious, painful, or distressing. Included in this conception are both drive and anxiety-reduction models. The second theoretical position sug- gests that behavior is learned that arouses positive sensations or leads to some type of satisfying state. To the extent that both types of learning can take place in counseling, behavior change occurs. Counseling theory has long championed the belief that behavior change is a function of a special kind of relationship. Gendlin (1964), for example, has suggested that behavior change is generated as a result of a special affective ex- perience in an intimate and on-going interpersonal relationship with another. Rogers has postulated (and Truax [1966] has provided some verification) that behavior change is facilitated when three conditions characterize a relationship - accurate empathy, unconditional positive regard, and self-congruence. On the surface, then, it would appear that if we could simply implement the "necessary and sufficient conditions" in a counseling relationship we would move the client in the direction of desirable behavior change. Obviously, it is not that simple. We must still describe exactly how these appropriate conditions are established in a relationship. It makes considerable sense to view behavior change as involving two basic propositions: (a) acquisition or development of more effective responses or be- haviors; and (b) altering or extinguishing disordered or maladaptive behavior (Ford &amp; Urban, 1963). Effective behavioral acquisitions involve at the minimum: (a) instrumental responses allowing need satisfaction, prediction of the environment and suc- cessful problem-processing; (b) competence in dealing with a given environ-</page><page sequence="4">1 77 I STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE ment; (c) positive self-evaluations; and (d) appropriate mastery of sex, social, and interpersonal roles. When we consider altering disordered behavior, we might think of (a) di- minishing or extinguishing negative affects inappropriately tied to responses or situations, (b) changing avoidance behaviors associated with negative affects, (c) altering inappropriate attending and perceiving, and (d) modifying inap- propriate self-evaluations (Ford &amp; Urban, 1963). Of course, this concept of behaviors to be learned or changed is illustrative, not exhaustive. The point is that we must be more definite in identifying the nature and direction of behavior change, as well as the steps to be taken to alter it. Then, we can choose the most effective strategy to get there. Once we have identified the behavior to be acquired or changed, we have the task of eliciting or prompting the desired responses or changing those behaviors that prevent them from occurring. Some systems (such as psychoanalysis and client-centered therapy) rely on the self-eliciting responses of the client - what the client chooses to talk about or do determines content and direction. In other systems, the counselor presents a stimulus that elicits certain appropriate client responses and behaviors that move him in a desirable direction. Regardless of one's theoretical position, it is necessary to get the client to make specified cognitive, affective, and psychomotor responses that lead to certain desirable overt or intrapsychic effects. Strategies for Change Assuming that there is some established priority for facilitating normal, healthy development, the counselor builds the conditions that elicit or generate devel- opmentally healthy behaviors. One theoretical base from which such strategies can be created is imitative or model learning. Modeling Bandura (1965a) has substantially demonstrated that new or novel behavior not present in a person's repertoire can be efficiently acquired through such procedures. Modeling tends to strengthen or weaken inhibited responses and elicits already-learned responses that are similar to those exhibited by the model. Significantly, film-mediated models appear to be as effective as real- life models in the acquisition or changing of certain behaviors. Although non- human cartoon characters portrayed in films result in less dramatic modeling effects, they are still useful. Baer and Sherman (1964) have even demon- strated that children adopt or imitate self-reinforcement behavior exhibited by</page><page sequence="5">178 I ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING models. Apparently, children tend to imitate the model's expectations as a means of giving oneself rewards. (This is no news; psychoanalytic theory has postu- lated it for some time.) The power to increase imitative or modeling behavior is greatly enhanced when behaviors in which change is desired are modeled in a graduated se- quence. For example, Bandura (1967b) reports that phobias and inhibitions can be removed by having the fearful person view graduated sequences of modeled activities presented in a hierarchy, beginning with the phobic stimulus most easily tolerated. Such procedures work whether in a real-life situation or a film-mediated version. The modeling studies suggest that counselors can use selected modeling pro- cedures with either direct or vicarious reinforcement, mediated through films, to facilitate behavior acquisition or change. These procedures can be used with equal effectiveness with individuals or groups. A second implication is the im- pact a teacher model has in influencing child behavior. Her model (or person- ality) characteristics, her reinforcement style, and the children to whom she dispenses reinforcement powerfully affect behavior in a classroom. Perhaps high on the counselor's list of role priorities is systematic analysis of classroom inter- action to determine how these variables are operating. A third implication for group counseling follows from this research. If sufficient care in selecting chil- dren for group counseling is exercised so that children provide appropriate models for each other and reinforcement is selectively utilized, behavior change is more likely to move in a predictable direction. Play therapy In this connection, we should not overlook the potential of group play therapy. As is well known, play therapy traditionally has been the preferred treatment for child problems, largely because of the child's incom- pletely developed communication system and his fascination with the object world. Ginott (1961, p. 51) captured its essence when he said, ". . . the child's play is his talk and the toys are his words." Amster (1964) has suggested that play is a means by which a child "registers his growth." It reveals how he relates to others, the types of preoccupations and inhibitions he has and the fractures developing in his emerging ego. Play often provides a detailed photo- graph of cognition and the present state of his affective world. In group play therapy, the child has the opportunity to experience multiple identifications, experiment with new behavior, learn new social roles, and ex- perience multiple feedback from his peers. These gains do not occur naturally</page><page sequence="6">179 I STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE but appear to be a function of the elicitors in the situation. That is, if care is ex- ercised in selecting the children and the materials in the play room, desirable behavior change may be elicited directly. Marcus (1966) describes the use of costume play therapy in the treatment of an underachieving, effeminate, and submissive boy. By encouraging the child to make up a play with various costumes, he was able to elicit behaviors as- sociated with conflict, resolve them, and facilitate desirable learnings. In a sense, the costumes were a safe invitation for an interaction by which the child revealed the conflicts in his intrapsychic self. It would appear, then, that by systematic analysis of the child's developmen- tal lags and maladaptive behaviors, a therapist may use play materials or sit- uations selectively (in a safe environment) to elicit desirable behavior so that unlearning and new learning proceeds effectively. With a little ingenuity, any number of situations may be directly simulated. For example, Schall (19 67) paired 18 subjects on the basis of social adjustment and overt aggression. She then exposed one member of each pair to two different treatments for 21 ses- sions. Children were asked to play individually for 20 minutes in a room equipped with standard play therapy materials. A second group was given the same opportunity but the play materials consisted of two adult-size anthropo- morphic figures (male and female) and a child-size figure. The results sug- gested that the children who experienced the second treatment had a statistically significant decrease in overt aggression. Learning theory approaches A third theoretical base from which strategies may be drawn is the learning theory or behavior modification approach. Patterson (1965a, 1965b) has demonstrated the utility of these methods in the treatment of phobic and hyperactive children, Dickinson (1966) with children who do not complete school assignments, and Wetzel (1966) with a case of stealing. Barclay (1967) has made an application to the classroom setting by combining operant methods with role-playing interventions. Hewett (1967a, 1967b) has utilized operant techniques in small classrooms in changing the behavior of children with learning disabilities and emotional handicaps. Lazarus and Abramovitz (1965) have used systematic desensitization in successfully treating phobic children. Bijou (1965), using operant techniques, has devised an interesting paradigm that has much to recommend it. A child with an adjustment or behavior prob- lem is invited, along with his mother, into a room in which their typical inter- actions are observed. The mother's reinforcement of certain classes of responses</page><page sequence="7">l80 I ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING are observed and analyzed. After analysis of these interactions is completed, the mother is taught to reinforce certain classes of responses on signal from the experimenter while interacting with the child. Thus the maladaptive behavior appears and is changed in a relationship that is instrumental in generating the behavior in the first place. One is not faced with the problem of transferring the treatment effects in the situation to which they apply. Also, the fact that the mother observes directly the change in the child's behavior must be a powerful tonic for continuing the reinforcement style she has learned. Using this paradigm, it is possible that more comprehensive modification of overt behavior and intrapsychic events could be achieved. By adding appropriate play materials to the room so that a greater range of behavior between mother and child could occur, the therapist would have a more complete picture of the conflicts and could systematically modify them. Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the growing interest in family therapy. Learning theory approaches obviously may provide a fertile field from which to build change strategies. We should note, however, Breger and McGaugh's (19 66) criticisms that reported studies have rarely used adequate controls and have tended to ignore clients with problems that do not fit the model (neurotic depressives, general unhappiness, obsessional disorders, etc.). It is also relatively rare to find studies where adequate follow-up has been done to see if behavior changes persist through time. Role Theory Strategies There is one final segment of theory from which useful strategies may be drawn - role theory. Briefly summarized, the theory suggests that each of us enacts a variety of roles consistent with our position and status in particular reference groups. Through the enactment of these roles, social interaction is structured and attitudes consistent with role enactments are assumed. People tend to formulate and re-formulate aspects of their identity based on the roles they have and are presently performing. When a person assumes a new role, expectations and behaviors of others change and performance changes to meet the new role demands. When the at- titudes and actions of a person are consistent with the expectations of the role he performs, he feels at one with himself. If they are not, the role occupant experiences anxiety or dissonance, and he changes by assuming attitudes and</page><page sequence="8">l8l I STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE behaviors consistent with his new role. The more ego-involvement in the role, the more we expect attitudes to change (Sarbin, 1964). If this theory is correct, we assume that when a person shifts his role, others assume roles that complement that role, and behavior alters in certain pre- scribed directions (Keirsey, 1965). Summary The use of modeling, operant conditioning, systematic desensitization, group play therapy, and role shifts do not exhaust the strategies that can be adapted to elementary counselor use. We could mention the utility of simulation, role- playing, and "helper counselors." Those presented do indicate the many strate- gies that can be used to facilitate or change child behavior. Perhaps the major theme is this: Strategies are not applied randomly. The behavior to be changed must be appropriately identified and consistent with well-mapped-out human tasks or acquisitions that lead to healthy psychologi- cal differentiation. Strategies should be built on a substantial theoretical ra- tionale, oriented to the significant change agents and given maximum thrust by utilizing all of the interpersonal forces and resources of the school.
