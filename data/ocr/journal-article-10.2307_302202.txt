<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The Nine of Hearts": Fragment of A Psycho-reading of La NausIe Serge Doubrovsky translated by Carol A. Bove I have selected for our attention a rather insignificant detail in a rather famous scene: the scene at the cafe, the "Rendez-vous des Cheminots," where Roquentin finally experiences Nausea with a capital "N": "Things are bad! Things are very bad: I have it, the filth, the Nausea" (p. 18).1 Along with the print, Nausea here assumes capital importance: it attains a status which is clinical, as the symptom of a malady, ontological, as the revelation, through this malady, of the subject's mode of being-in-the-world, and esthetic, as the call to salvation through art, which is offered here by the "rag-time with a vocal refrain" and which will be taken up again by the "book," the "novel" planned by Roquentin in the conclusion. Sartre produces a discourse which "totalizes," or rather, which progresses by a process of totalization until the moment when Roquentin can say: "I understood that I had found the key to Existence, the key to my Nauseas, to my own life" (p. 129). Fictional language is equipped, is coupled with a metalanguage which is imperious, even imperialistic, and which seems, from the beginning, to exclude commentary, or, what amounts to the same thing, to include it. 411</page><page sequence="2">For years, the critical result has been paraphrase. After the wealth of explanations offered by the narrator himself (an ironic, post-Proustian tribute?) what more or better, or simply, what else, can be said of Nausea than what is said in the text? What remains for the critical eye to see? Nothing, certainly, except this unimportant detail: the Nausea scene closes upon a card game which is fairly intricate, and the game itself, just at the moment when Roquentin gets up, closes upon an exclamation by the "dog-faced young man": "Ah! The nine of hearts" (p. 24). This paper is therefore entitled: " 'The Nine of Hearts': Fragment of a Psycho-reading of La Naus6e." At the level of stylistic analysis, you might call it a purely realistic effect; verisimilitude in the narrative code demands that a card game be played, preferably "manille" or "belote," in a French cafe in the provinces. From this point of view, the ace of clubs or the nine of hearts would do the trick equally well. For me, psycho-criticism begins right where other forms of criticism stop: at the production, in the text, of an insignificant detail which cannot be accounted for by either the Sartrian meta-text or by another meta-discourse. Sartre might certainly just as well have written: "Ah! The ace of clubs" or the "nine of hearts" with the same narrative-stylistic effect. It remains that he has written "nine of hearts," and it is precisely this remains which remains for the critical eye to see, all the more since, strangely enough, this card, displayed right in the middle of the table, is not seen by the players: "One of the players pushes a disordered pack of cards towards another man who picks them up. One card has stayed behind. Don't they see it? It's the nine of hearts" (p. 23). What is insignificant now begins to signify, since the invisibile card which is right in front of their eyes is perceived only by Roquentin. This perception must in turn be perceived, and, hopefully, penetrated, by the psycho-critic. Don't worry, I'm not going to do or redo "The Purloined Letter" act, nor will I play or replay some "instance of the card." Abandoning for now this signifier at the end of its chain (which is our own in this discussion, since it closes precisely the narrative sequence of the cafe), and hoping to find it later in its place, let's leave Lacan for Freud and direct our attention straightaway to sex. Like Roquentin, as a matter of fact: "I was coming to screw, but no sooner had I opened the door than Madeleine, the waitress, called to me: 'The patronne isn't here, she's in town shopping.' I felt a sharp disappointment in the sexual parts, a long, disagreeable tickling" (p. 18). Before it makes your head "whirl," it "tickles," then, uncomfortably, in a definite erogenous zone. Like honor, Roquentin's penis is "ticklish," and of course, only what is by nature delicate, vulnerable to attack, can be ticklish in this way. Now, it strikes us immediately that there is a lack of proportion between the process which sets off Nausea (what in Sartrian terms might be called the "teleological circuit" of fornication: "I was coming to screw") and Antoine's usually 412</page><page sequence="3">very lukewarm ardor for the owner: "I dined at the Rendez-vous des Cheminots. The patronne was there and I had to screw her, but it was mainly out of politeness. She disgusts me a little, she is too white and besides, she smells like a newborn child .... I played distractedly with her genitals under the cover" (p. 59). Without having read Freud, we rightfully wonder why, when the owner is not there, he experiences such "sharp disappointment" in a zone which, when she is there, is, we must admit, hardly erogenous. Why this "long uncomfortable tickling" in a penis which is definitely more ticklish than it is capable of being tickled? Having read Freud, of course, we may wonder whether there is not an unconscious denominator common to the two complementary and antithetic sequences (I was coming to screw/I had to screw her), an operating chart common to the pleasure which is disappointed or received; or again, having read Mauron, we wonder whether the two texts are not superimposable. Once the act is more or less completed, sequence 2 (I had to screw her) produces something which makes the analyst happy: a "dream": "I let my arm run along the woman's thigh and suddenly saw a small garden with low, wide trees on which immense hairy leaves were hanging. Ants were running everywhere, centipedes and ring- worm. . . . Behind the cactus and the Barbary fig trees, the Valleda of the public park pointed a finger at her genitals. 'This park smells of vomit,' I shouted" (p. 59). Since we cannot go into the problematic of the written pseudo-dream, which is not a dream, but can be analyzed as if it were (see Freud on Jensen's Gradiva), and since we don't have the time to undertake a detailed analysis, we will confine ourselves to two remarks: (1) the "dream" subsequent to the consummation of the sex act shows the vagina to be an extremely anxiogenic source, precisely the nauseating site of a nightmare ("this park smells of vomit"), and (2) if we grant the traditional Freudian decoding, vermine=children, in dream language, we understand the nature of Roquentin's "disgust" for the owner who "smells like a newborn child." The parturient organ of the woman anticipates the final horror of a kind of swooning fecundity (the chestnut root scene): "my very flesh throbbed and opened, abandoned itself to the universal burgeoning. It was repugnant" (p. 133). Throbbing, opening, abandoning itself: Roquentin experiences his final Nausea as if his entire body had become the female organ, which is, moreover, "burgeoning," in gestation. It's an absolute nightmare. For whom? "I was coming to screw." For a man. Recalling sequence 1, we observe that the disappointment of a kind of ticklish masculinity is accompanied by another symptom: "at the same time I felt my shirt rubbing against the tips of my breasts and I was surrounded, seized by a slow, coloured mist" (p. 18). Usage demands that the word breast (and the Robert dictionary, I venture to add, confirms it), especially in the plural and in the expression: "the tips of my breasts," refer to a fundamental signifier of femininity, one of its essential appendages and endowments. A man usually speaks of his chest. 413</page><page sequence="4">Everything occurs, then, exactly as if this radical disgust for the female sex, projected as dream at the end of the completed sexual act, is introjected as phantasy in the aborted act, the failure to screw being in no way a failure to enjoy but a failure to prove: from the minute I become unable to prove that I am a man, I am immediately transformed into a woman. Such is the logic of Sartrian phantasy which thoroughly regulates the unfolding of Nausea. We could demonstrate in detail, in its four successive stages (pebble, cafe, little Lucienne, and chestnut root scenes), the inevitable progression of the phantasy, experienced in the merry-go-round of ambivalence, "whirling" from disgust to desire. That is, the phantasy is experienced as a number of stations of the cross at which the man-woman stops, obsessed by the sudden, forced substitution of a female sex for a precarious, masculine one: "How strange it is, how moving, that this hardness should be so fragile" (p. 22). This constitutes, at one and the same time, a malady and a remedy, since, in short, by assuming a femininity which makes you nauseous ("the viscous puddle at the bottom of our time" [p. 21]), it is a question of bartering actual masculinity for a kind of inexpugnable, imaginary one, inscribed in the symbolic domain: the "steel band" of music or the "beautiful," "hard as steel" story into which Roquentin dreams of transposing himself. Those who are suspicious of this analysis can at least give credence to "Sartre Through Flaubert," or, if they prefer, to "Sartre: A Self-Portrait." Thus, by reading Sartre reading Gustave, we reread precisely La Nausee: Flesh is complete inaction.... now, according to Gustave, pleasure arises from a kind of swooning abandonment, from a passivity which is ready and willing; the woman feels pleasure because she is taken. She feels desire, too, of course, but in her own way.... female desire is passive waiting. The text speaks for itself: if Gustave wants to be a woman, it is because his partially female sexuality demands a sex change which will allow the full development of his resources. In this respect, Antoine is Gustave's guilty conscience. "The text speaks for itself," said Sartre: yes, especially when it believes it is talking about the Other. Let's take a look at Sartre as he imagines Flaubert looking at himself in a mirror: At the start, out of his natural passivity, he creates the analagon of a femininity which is concealed .... it is possible for him, at the cost of creating a double illusion, to imagine that he is someone else, who is caressing an actual woman - himself - behind the mirror .... There 414</page><page sequence="5">are two analoga here: his hands, his reflection. In the latter, he apprehends only his caressed flesh, overlooking insignificant details like his penis or his youthful male chest.2 In this "Sartre Through Flaubert," then, we surprise Jean-Paul as he rewrites precisely the progression of Nausea, that is, the progressive feminization of his flesh, which goes from his hands (pebble scene), to his face in the mirror ("An entire half of my face yields.... the eye opens on a white globe, on pink, bleeding flesh" [p. 17] ), preceding the entrance into the cafe where the narrator suddenly "loses" the insignificant detail which is his penis and where his youthful, male chest becomes '.'the tips of his breasts." The discourse of fiction and the discourse of criticism display a strange kind of intertextuality/intersexuality. In fact, if Madame Bovary is a man disguised as a woman,3 there is no reason why Antoine Roquentin cannot be a woman disguised as a man. But if we prefer to believe "Sartre: A Self-Portrait," let's listen to him directly as he answers the formidable questions of the formidable Simone: "Now then, Sartre, I would like to question you on the subject of women . . . you've never talked about women. .. . how do you explain that?" - "I think it stems from my childhood.... girls and women formed, in a way, my natural milieu, and / have always thought that there was a kind of woman in me."4 But, not as "natural" as all that, as La Nausde demonstrates, and this reticence on the subject of women is in no way innocent, analytically speaking (I'll leave ideology to Simone). At the level of unconscious discourse, La Nausee fills precisely the strange gap in the writer's conscious discourse, and the trio "Antoine - Jean-Paul - Gustave" reveals more about it than Sartre would like to say or to admit to himself. We know that the notion of "bisexuality," introduced both as a major and as a poorly defined element in Freudian thought, receives a good deal of attention from psychoanalysts, at least from those of the Psychoanalytic Society of Paris, which devoted its April 1975 meeting to it. According to a recent report by Dr. Christian David, every successful cure implies the integration of the subject's psychic bisexuality; inversely, he tells us: "every serious threat concerning sexual identity or integrity is likely to lead to a variety of disturbances to psychic organization, to the point of psychosis." And the French psychiatrist Kreisler formulates the same idea in a vocabulary which is of particular interest for us: "Belonging to a sex constitutes one of the firmest kernels enabling the personality to cohere, and sexuality may be the most primitive and most powerful form rooting us in existence."5 That Roquentin's final Nausea takes place in front of an eminently phallomorphous root ("the bark, black and swollen, looked like boiled leather . . . this hard and compact skin of a sea lion" [pp. 127-28, 129]) clearly indicates that the form taken by the subject's existential crisis consists in a kind of rooting in masculinity. "I am not at 415</page><page sequence="6">all inclined to call myself insane," writes Roquentin (p. 2). He shouldn't feel this way, especially at a time when neurosis is terribly devalued and when only psychosis gives status to the writer. The critic, however, is not a psychiatrist, and the diagnosis (if you wish, the so-called "construction" element) is of interest only if it produces something which is equivalent to the stream of new, repressed material which Freud sees (Construction in Analysis, 1937) as the touchstone of a correct interpretation. Here, this equivalent would be the increasingly thorough integration of metonymically discreet elements of the text into a coherent, metaphoric sequence. At bottom, a psycho-reading simply establishes what may be called a rigorous logic of details, to the extent that the logic which underlies the possibilities of the narrative is reinserted into the operation of the phantasy. If we fold erotic sequence 1 ("I was coming to screw") down upon erotic sequence 2 ("1 had to screw her"), we might say that the masculine obligation which has been fulfilled avoids the crisis of sexual identity, if it is true, according to R. R. Greenson's remark, that "the adult neurotic behaves as if the sex of his sexual object determined his own sex." But traces of the signifiers' first logic subsist in the second: no sooner does the Valleda in the public or pubic garden point to her genitals as the "sinful parts," in this way reassuring the male sleeper, than upon waking, the latter hears the owner say to him: "I didn't want to wake you up . . . but the sheet got folded under my backside" (p. 59). The syntagmatic order is revealing: this vestige of "daytime" sets off immediately afterwards another "dream" in the fictional text, a dream in which the "backside" signifier proliferates, having been repressed as a simple detail pertaining to the "real" in the vigil scene (the fold in the sheet). The obsession is fully manifested: I gave Maurice Barres a spanking. We were three soldiers and one of us had a hole in the middle of his face. Maurice Barres came up to us and said, "That's fine!" and he gave each of us a small bouquet of violets. "I don't know where to put them," said the soldier with the hole in his head. Then Maurice Barris said, "Put them in the hole you have in your head." The soldier answered, "I'm going to stick them up your ass." (p. 59) Once again, a detailed analysis is impossible here. Let us mention only the triple associative constellation: head with hole - put up your ass - bouquet of violets; and, with a movement reversing the first, let's fold it back upon erotic sequence 1. In the cafe where we left him, we find Roquentin in the throes of Nausea, flopping on the bench: "The bottom of my seat is broken.... I have a broken spring .... My head is all pliable and elastic, as though it had been simply set on my neck; if I turn it, it will fall off" (p. 19). Having 416</page><page sequence="7">become the "little, detachable object," the "broken spring," the head which turns to the point where it risks falling off, reveals severe castration anguish at the source of Nausea: in vertigo, Roquentin actually experiences his head as a penis, facing the castration threat which takes aim at his narcissistic identification. "I dropped to a seat, I no longer knew where I was" (p. 18): the text, however, knows exactly where he is; when he (his head) drops, Antoine is in the spot where the "seat is broken" (d6fonc6e). Now, in the crude slang which is dear to Sartre, "se faire defoncer" (to get buggered) designates the greatly feared act which transforms the masculine subject into a "queer." The anguish of castration, which feminizes, causes a return to a vulnerability which is fundamental to him: the anus is the male's vagina. Disgust (desire) for the female sex becomes interiorized in the phantasmatic register as the obsession to possess a potential feminine sex, which is actualized in Nausea. The fear of castration is accompanied by a severe complementary fear of sodomization. Let's not forget the answer to Maurice Barres who tells the soldier to put the bouquet "in the hole you have in your head" (the soldier's head with a hole in it, Roquentin's head which has been cut off): "I'm going to stick them up your ass." Now what is stuck up this ass, if I may inquire? A bouquet of violets. The obsession with sodomization, experienced as feminization, (phantasy being along with common sense the most widely shared thing in the world, Roquentin finds himself here in the excellent company of Freud's President Schreber who is "God's wife") is, moreover, designated, in the Sartrian text, by a special signifier, violet, since, let's not forget, Roquentin's Nausea is also a colored vertigo: "I saw the colors spin slowly around me" (p. 18). A thematic analysis of the signified would easily show that, in the Sartrian text, this color is the emblem for a sexuality which is feminine and lethal. (A case in point, the cashier with whom Roquentin spontaneously identifies: "she's red haired, as I am; she suffers from a stomach disorder. She is rotting quietly under her skirts with a melancholy smile, like the odour of violets given off by a decomposing body" [p. 55] .) We are, then, less surprised than Annie at this esthetic repugnance on Antoine's part: "You swore indignantly for a year that you wouldn't see Violettes Imperiales" (p. 140). But, still more important, violet is the Sartrian color for a formidable female sexuality even at the level of signification as "viol" (rape), as violated. This is affirmed in the next stage of Nausea when the narrator identifies with "little Lucienne" after he has done so with the putrescent cashier: "Little Lucienne was raped [viole]. Strangled. Her body still exists.... She no longer exists. Her hands . . . I ... there, I . .. Raped [Viol6e]. A soft, bloody desire for rape takes me from behind" (pp. 100-01). The very ambiguity of the expression: "bloody desire for rape" (to rape, to be raped?), which is none other than the ambivalence of active/passive desire, is momentarily resolved for the benefit of a transsexualization which is phantasmatically assumed by way of the place where desire takes hold of 417</page><page sequence="8">the subject: from behind. There is in this an exact symbolic equivalence between the way that he experiences his flesh as feminine ("My body of living flesh which murmurs and turns gently, liquors which turn to cream .. the sweet sugary water of my flesh" [pp. 101-02]) and his universal Schreberian sodomization: "existence takes my thoughts from behind and gently expands them from behind; someone takes me from behind, they force me to think from behind.... he runs, he runs like a ferret, 'from behind' from behind from behind, little Lucienne assaulted from behind, violated by existence from behind" (p. 102). Little Lucienne, having reappeared just in time as the last link in the chain of verbal delirium, is necessarily "assaulted from behind," if Roquentin is to be able to "become" her. Here, according to the law which Freud assigned to the development of the dream sequences of a single night, which progress from what is most hidden to what is most manifest, all elements of the Sartroquentinian phantasma appear unrepressed in the delirious writing (desyntaxization, degrammaticalization, decodification in the narrative indicating that "textual work" is fulfilling sexual impulse). We have not yet arrived at that point, and in the cafe scene, the elements mentioned only show through something else, are a little obscured, hesitant: like cousin Adolph's suspenders (the traditional emblem, if ever there was one, of proletarian machismo, the Gabin-suspenders of the Prevert-Carn4 films), which "hesitate" between blue and mauve ("You feel like saying, 'All right, become violet and let's hear no more about it' " [p. 19] ). But, at this stage, and it is for this reason that they are discussed, that is, written about, the suspenders cannot, do not want to become violet; and where Robbe-Grillet formerly saw naive anthropomorphism in Sartrian description, we see the very clear, precise inscription of phantasy, which already articulates "the time of violet suspenders and broken chair seats" (p. 21) in a strangely condensed form. The drive which is yearning and delirious is controlled by the call already mentioned to a kind of imaginary masculinity, to this "band of steel, the narrow duration of the music which traverses our time through and through" (p. 21), whose effect is indicated as specifically as is its cause: "When the voice was heard in the silence, I felt my body harden and the Nausea vanish" (p. 22).6 A controlled drive, we might say, but nevertheless one in which a dangerous and latent feminization is retained, not only in the female vocalist's song, but also in the very reaction of the veterinarian's little girl listening to the music: "Barely seated, the girl has been seized by it: she holds herself stiffly, her eyes wide open" (pp. 21-22). A phallic, female child, we might say, in whom what holds itself stiffly is a woman's penis. We are hardly surprised that the book's final solution constitutes a kind of fetishism of art. Yet the cafe scene doesn't end with the disappearance of Nausea under the spell of the music; it closes upon that innocuous card game which demanded our attention in the beginning - less innocuous, perhaps, 418</page><page sequence="9">for being "manille," if we consider that Nausea originally attacks the "main" (hand), which is punished later on ("I ... stab the knife into the palm" [p. 100] ). Having averted obsession with sodomization, Roquentin has yet to confront the threat of castration, in order that the well-known "masculine protest" be complete. This second phase of the phantasmatic operation is carried out vicariously in the card players scene. When the "great, red-faced young man" throws down his diamond "manille," the "dog-faced young man" immediately trumps him (this head, like that of a domesticated, male animal, is an improvement over Roquentin's "pliable," "elastic" one): "Hell. He's trumped" (p. 23). You coupe (trump) in cards; you also coupe (castrate) on the analyst's couch; and there, when it comes to the father, there's no cutting out. It's precisely he who appears, only to disappear in his most classic form: The outline of the king of hearts appears between his curled fingers, then it is turned on its face and the game goes on. Mighty king, come from so far, prepared by so many combinations, by so many vanished gestures. He disappears in turn so that other combinations can be born, other gestures. (p. 23) The unexpected lyricism in this passage has no meaning in terms of the "realistic" code of a narrative in which Roquentin is not known to be a great "cardomaniac" or "manillephile." On an Other Stage and in another code, the reading is perfectly logical: the "son" castrates (coupe) the "father," liquidates the Oedipal complex by reversing the threat; in order that the son be born, the "king of hearts" disappears, as Mr. de Rollebon does later on (another imaginary murder of the father). Dubbed male, consecrated truly virile, he is struck by an otherwise unexplainable "emotion" which we can well understand: "I am touched, I feel my body at rest like a precision machine" (p. 23), a rest which is well deserved after such transsexual terrors. We understand equally well the stream of memories which suddenly overwhelms Roquentin precisely at this point in the phantasmatic chain: "I have.. . plunged into forests, always making my way towards other cities. I have had women, I have fought with men" (p. 23). In keeping with a masculinity which is from now on homologized, reassured concerning his two essential attributes, the screwer-fighter is at peace with his "human machine": it is normal that he should see what others do not see, since this is the site of his phantasy: the "neuf de coeur."7 "New of heart," he can set out once again ("That's it, I'm going to leave" [p. 24] ), and gets off on the right foot, except, alas, for one gauche move. It's the card which "has stayed behind": "someone takes it at last, gives it to the dog-faced young man .... Ah! The nine of hearts" (pp. 23-24). There is certainly reason for this surprise. As far as the phantasy's resolution is concerned, you are not "given" masculinity, you 419</page><page sequence="10">have to "take" it yourself, that is, to apprehend it, unless you have "stayed behind," or as we say, "are left back." Not knowing what to do with it and not having yet decided to transmute or to "transmalize" it into writing, "the young man turns and turns the nine of hearts between his fingers" (p. 24). But, along with this failure, there may already be the promise of a (re)solution to come, since, next to the young man, "the violet-faced man bends over a sheet of paper and sucks his pencil."
