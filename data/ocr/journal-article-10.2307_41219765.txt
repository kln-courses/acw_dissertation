<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tombs and Burials in the Monastery tou Libos in Constantinople VASILEIOSMARINIS For Henry Maguire 1929 Theodore Macridy, then assistant curator at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, conducted the first significant survey of the monastery tou Libos, one of the most important complexes to have survived from Byzantine Constantinople (fig. 1). The final report of this survey appeared only much later, in 1964, in an English translation by Cyril Mango and Ernest J. W. Hawkins.1 The quantity and quality of finds unearthed by Macridy were impressive, ranging from fragments of late antique statuettes to glazed tiles, from an archivolt with busts of Christ and his disciples to marble inlaid icons, including the famous icon of Saint Eudokia.2 Further investigations by Mango and Hawkins brought to light additional material,3 while Arthur H. S. Megaw, during the extensive restoration of the complex in the 1960s, was able to clarify some aspects of the original form of the north church, dedi- cated to the Theotokos Panachrantos.4 One of the most striking aspects of the com- plex revealed by Macridy 's survey was the abundance of burials of different types within the monastery: twenty-nine tombs, along with four ossuaries (fig. 2). Although its function as the mausoleum for Theodora Palaiologina's family justifies the existence of numer- ous tombs in the late thirteenth-century south church f^v, This paper has benefited from discussions with several col- leagues.

While the monastery tou Libos is one of Constantinople's better-studied Byzantine buildings, the specifics of its funerary (and by extension memorial) character have been, with few exceptions, all but ignored. The disappearance of almost all evidence for these tombs certainly has contributed to this situation. I revisit the evidence from the monastery tou Libos with the inten- tion of better placing its interment function in the context of Byzantine burial customs and practices, and to offer new suggestions regarding the identification of some individual tombs. The Monastery tou Libos The history, architectural and otherwise, of the monas- tery tou Libos has been sufficiently explored elsewhere.5 Therefore, only a brief outline for the purposes of con- text is necessary here. The complex is located in the Lycus valley, southwest of the present-day Fatih Camii, the site of the church of the Holy Apostles. Constantine Lips, a high military official in the imperial army,6 founded the original monastery and dedicated it to the Theotokos. Its consecration took place in 907, with the participation of Emperor Leo VI.7 The monastery's his- tory from this point until the thirteenth century is not well documented. Between the years 1281 and 1303 the dowager empress Theodora, widow of Michael VIII Palaiologos, restored the complex and added a second church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist to the south of the existing tenth-century church of the Theotokos.8 An outer ambulatory enveloping the two churches along the west and south sides was added shortly after the ° completion of the church of Saint John. The typikon or foundation document (written sometime between 1294 and 1301)9 that Theodora Palaiologina bequeathed to the monastery tou Libos survives to this day.10 Burying the Dead in Monasteries The question of tombs inside monastic churches should be addressed as part of the wider question of the existence of tombs in churches of any kind.11 It is 5 In addition to the sources cited in notes 1, 3, and 4, see A.

Early imperial and ecclesiastical regulations unequivocally prohibit burials inside places of wor- ship. The legislation of Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosios I of 381 orders that above-ground funerary urns and sarcophagi be moved extra urbem, and pro- hibits burials inside the city limits, specifically inside churches of apostles and martyrs: "That no person may evade the purpose of this regulation by false and cunning shrewdness and suppose that the churches of apostles and martyrs are allowed to be used for the burial of bodies; they shall know and appreciate that they are barred from such burial places just as from the rest of the city/'12 In the sixth century, Justinian's legislation repeats the explicit interdiction against burying the dead inside the churches of apostles and martyrs.13 While the ban against intra urbem buri- als was abolished by Leo VTs novella fifty-three,14 the prohibition against tombs inside churches continued to be upheld. The ninth-century Basilika declare: "Nobody should bury the dead in a holy church."15 The archaeological evidence from the churches of Constantinople and elsewhere appears, however, to suggest this legislation was ignored. Leaving aside cases in which tombs were placed in subsidiary funerary cha- pels, as at the Pantokrator and Pammakaristos monas- teries, where such chapel burials were not technically inside "a holy church," Constantinopolitan church burials are located in narthexes and, less frequently, in the naoi. The two churches of the monastery tou Libos are the most extreme examples of this trend, for they contain twenty-nine burials in their narthexes and naves.

The widespread contradictions in Byzantine church burial have often been dismissed as yet another example of the disparity between official legislation and everyday practice. Burying important persons inside a church (and indeed intra urbem) had a very old precedent: emperors, members of the imperial family, and bishops were buried inside the church of the Holy Apostles.17 This practice has been interpreted as a con- tinuation of the early Christian adsanctos burials (buri- als close to a saints tomb), although this is not necessarily the case.18 Nevertheless, the implication that laws were not observed when it came to the wealthy and power- ful would amount to a misapprehension of the religious rationale behind those burial practices. In the majority of cases, such burials are located in areas of secondary liturgical importance, namely in adjacent burial chapels, in the narthex, and in the side aisles of the naos. Thus, in the north church of tou Libos five tombs were found in the narthex (fig. 2, nos. 2-6); four outside the church, aligned with the central and southern entrances to the narthex (nos. 7-10), the former in an area that in the tenth century would have been covered by an open-air portico; and only one in the north aisle of the naos (no. 1), along with an ossuary in the south side (D). In the south church, dedicated to Saint John, all the tombs and ossuaries in the naos were grouped within the corridor created by its colonnaded ambulatory (nos. I-IX and Α-B), whereas several other burials were located in the narthex (X-XII and C) and in the outer ambulatory (XIII-XIX). This arrangement is by no means peculiar to the monastery tou Libos}** The funerary character of middle and late Byzantine churches in the capital is usually associated with the existence of subsidiary burial chapels and outer ambulatories, but in actuality several of the surviving Constantinopolitan churches had tombs in the narthex and the side aisles, a fact that has received little attention.20 For example, in the Vefa Kilise Camii, an eleventh-century church with a Palaiologan exonarthex and north annex, M. I. Nomidis uncovered eight tomb sites in the 1930s: two in the north annex, two in the exonarthex, two in the narthex, and two in the naos - one in the north aisle and one in the southwest corner compartment of the naos. Some of those tombs contained multiple burials.21 The narthex of Hirami Ahmet Раса Camii (usually identified with Saint John of Troullo, twelfth cen- tury) has arcosolia, presumably for tombs.22 The naos of the katholikon of the Pammakaristos monastery, a Komnenian construction, contained several tombs in the ambulatory that envelops the central bay;23 the 16 See A.

Gerstel, "Painted Sources for Female Piety in Medieval Byzantium," DOP 52 (1998): 98-102. The narthex as a place for burials and as a place for commemorations should be differentiated, the two functions not being concomitant all the time. 17 Thus, Valentinian I, Constantia (Gratian's wife), and Paul (Maurice's father) were buried in the church. Patriarch Flavian was also buried there, along with John Chrysostom, whose body was transferred there by Theodosios II.

Kolokotsas, Aliki, vol. 2, La basilique double (Athens, 1984), 219-27.

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 63</page><page sequence="6">цг I VASILEIOSMARINIS funerary parekklesion (ca. 1304), attached to the south side of the katholikon, contained one tomb in an arco- solium set against the wall (presumably that of the two new founders, Michael Tarchaneiotes Glabas and his wife Maria),24 and three (possibly four) more tombs in the narthex.25 Two arcosolia are located in the north and south wall of the narthex in the so-called Manastir Mescidi, probably of Palaiologan date.26 Pasadaios suggested that they were occupied by two anthropoid sarcophagi excavated nearby in the 1960s, which were similar to those found in the north church of the mon- astery tou Libos?1 Two arcosolia were originally located in the south church of the Pantokrator monastery, and were later converted to doors. Megaw suggests that the tomb of Irene, wife of John II Komnenos and founder of the church, might originally have been in the south- ern arcosolium.28 At the Chora monastery, tombs were concentrated in the narthex, exonarthex, and south- ern funerary chapel. Even in centrally planned build- ings, such as the martyrion of Saint Euphemia by the Hippodrome (which contained Palaiologan tombs),29 the Sancaktar Hayreddin Mescidi,30 and the Balaban Aga Mescidi,31 burials were placed in niches, away from the liturgical center. The situation is similar in other parts of the empire, including Cappadocia,32 the Balkans,33 and Greece.34 The location of surviving tombs indicates that the prohibition against burials in churches was liberally interpreted (or circumvented, as it were) as not referring to the church in toto but rather to its liturgical center, primarily the bema and the central bay of the naos. Even when tombs exist inside the naos, they are always on the sides, leaving the central bay and the sanctuary free. The archaeological evidence from Greece, the only area for which a comprehensive overview of the funerary monu- ments exists, confirms this hypothesis.35 Byzantine authors support, directly or indirectly, this differentia- tion between a church s main liturgical space and zones of secondary importance. First, differing importance was attached to the main church and to its unconse- crated subsidiary chapels (and chapels in general). When asked whether the dead may be buried in a church, the canonist Theodore Balsamon in the twelfth century differentiated between properly consecrated churches and the so-called eukteria?6 The latter lacked the relics 24 Mango, Mouriki, and Belting, Pammakaristos, 21-22. 25 C.

This distinction can be applied to the numerous subsidiary funerary chapels in churches of the middle and late Byzantine period. It is easy to comprehend why a non-consecrated chapel would be of secondary liturgical importance. But what about the narthex? In his Interpretation of the Divine Temple, Symeon, archbishop of Thessalonike (d. 1429), makes distinctions between the three parts of the church: And for another reason the whole divine temple can be perceived in triadic terms - the [structures] before the naos, the naos, and the sanctuary. This signifies the Trinity, the triadically arranged orders above, and the pious people divided into three - the clergy, the "'perfect' faithful/' and those in repentance. But the form of the divine church symbolizes the things on earth and in the heavens and those beyond heavens. Thus, the narthex is the earth, the naos is the heavens, and the most holy bema represents those things beyond the heavens.38 In Symeon's scheme the bema is the holiest of places, as the space of the clergy and a signifier for the things beyond the heavens. At the opposite extreme, the narthex symbolizes the earth and serves the needs of the repentant sinners who were not allowed in the church proper.39 Later in the same text Symeon clearly states that the "sinners" are not to cross into the church, but must stay in the narthex.40 Theodore Balsamon, expressing his disdain for what appears to be a common practice and belief dur- ing his lifetime, implicitly testifies that the narthex was not considered as holy as the rest of the church. Commenting on the Second Canon of Dionysios of Alexandria, which bans menstruating women from attending services in the church, Balsamon writes: We see today, mostly in nunneries, such women [i.e., menstruating women] standing without fear in the narthexes, which are beautified with all kinds of holy icons and assigned to the praising of God. And when we ask how is that allowed, we are answered that they are not in the church, which is not what I think! Because the narthexes are not public spaces, like the atria of the churches, but a part of them assigned to women who are not impeded from attending the services. The same narthex is the second place for repentance, called [the place] of the ones who listen. And in it are not allowed to stand even men who were punished with a ban from attending services, but they should stay outside and weep [during the services]. But if such unclean women were meant to stand in these narthexes, the latter would not properly fulfill the role of the church [in the way it does when] the priests cross it with the holy gifts during the Cherubic Hymn [i.e., during the Great Entrance], and cense the tombs and saints that are perhaps located in them, and perform services with holy prayers. Or at least, after [a decision] of a committee of bishops such spaces [i.e., narthexes] Σύνταγμα τών §είων και ιερών κανόνων, 6 vols. (Athens, 1852), 4479· See also a summary of this canon in A.

But I saw such a woman standing in the narthex and the bishop read for her the prayer of the betrothal, something I was amazed at.41 Despite Balsamon's protestations, people in his time assumed that standing in the narthex of the church was different from standing in the church. Thus, menstruating women, otherwise banned from attending services, could indisputably stand there. That this was a widely held belief is indicated by Balsamon's last sentence: even a bishop saw no problem in reading the prayer of the Betrothal to a menstruating woman in the narthex. The fact that the narthex is of secondary liturgical (and therefore spiritual) importance should not come as a surprise. Even Balsamon is at pains when he tries to jus- tify the sanctity of the narthex: it has icons; the priests traverse it briefly during the Great Entrance; if tombs happen to exist in the narthex, they are censed (here Balsamon admits incidentally that tombs in narthexes were a rather common phenomenon); and finally, "ser- vices of holy prayers" are read in those spaces - obviously minor services and prayers addressing specific situations, usually found at the end of the euchologion. Although liturgical activity in the narthex was frequent, it was limited to services of secondary importance (such as the Hours), and these services often required neither the use of an altar nor the presence of an officiating priest.42 41 "βλέπομεν σήμερον εις τα γυναικεία και μάλλον μοναστήρια άδεώς τοιαύτας ίσταμένας γυναίκας ε'ις τους πρόναους, παντοίαις άγίαις είκοσι κεκαλλωπισμένους, και εις δοξολογίαν Θεού άπονεμηθέντας, και ερωτώντες δπως τούτο γίνεται, άκούομεν μή έκκλησιάζειν αύτάς, όπερ έμοι τέως ου δοκεΐ. ού γάρ είσιν οι πρόναοι κοινοί, ώς τα των εκκλησιών προαύλια, άλλα μέρος αυτών άπονεμηθέν ταίς γυναιξί ταΐς μή κωλυομέναις έκκλησιάζειν. δς δή πρόναος, τόπος δεύτερος έστι μετανοίας, ό των άκροωμένων λεγόμενος, και εν αύτω, ουδέ άνδράσιν έφεΐται ϊστασθαι έπιτιμηθεΐσι μή έκκλησιάζειν, άλλα έξωθεν αυτού προσκλαίειν.Έδει γοΰν τους τοιούτους πρόναους, εις ους αί τοιαυται ακάθαρτοι γυναίκες Ιμελλον ϊστασθαι, μή άναπληρουν τόπον εκκλησιών εξ ορθού, ώστε και ιερείς μετά τών θείων αγιασμάτων διέρχεσθαι κατά τον χερουβικον υμνον, και θυμιαν τους εν τούτω όντας ίσως τάφους και αγίους, και τελετας αγίων ευχών ποιείν. ή καν μετά επισκοπικής επιτροπής τους τοιούτους τόπους άφορίζεσθαι, ώστε άποκριματίστως ϊστασθαι έν αύτοίς τας ακάθαρτους γυναίκας.

Taft, The Great Entrance: A History of the Transfer of Gifts and Other Pre-Anaph oral Rites, 2nd ed. (Rome, 1978), 199-200; idem, "Women at Church in Byzantium: Where, When- and Why?" DOP 52 (1998): 50-55. 42 Certain typika mention that some of the Hours were read in the narthex. The most elaborate ritual that took place in the narthex was the service of the Washing of the Feet on Holy Thursday. For this service see J. Goar, ed., Euchologion sive Rituale Graecorum (Venice, 1647; repr. Graz, i960), 745-53; S. Petrides, "Le lavement des pieds le jeudi-saint dans l'église grecque," EO 3 (1899-1900): 321-26. The ser- vice is attested in both the 10th-century typikon of the Great Church and some monastic typika, like that of Kecharitomene (1110-16). See J. Mateos, Le typicon dela Grande Eglise, OCA 165-66 (Rome, 1962- 63), 2:72-75; a Kecharitomene: Typikon of Empress Irene Doukaina Komnene for the Convent of the Mother of God Kecharitomene in Constantinople," in BMFD, 2:652 (where it stipulates that the feast of the Epiphany be celebrated in the narthex). For the connection between the image of the Washing of the Feet and the service, see S. Tomekovic, "Contribution à l'étude du programme du narthex des églises monastiques (XIe-première moitié du XIIIe s.)," Byzantion 58 (1988): 140-54; W. Tronzo, "Mimesis in Byzantium: Notes Toward a History of the Function of the Image," RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics 25 (1994): 61-76; C. Barber, "Mimesis and Memory in the Narthex Mosaics at the Nea Moni, Chios," Art History 24, no. 3 (2001): 323-37. How common this service was in the middle and late Byzantine periods is in doubt. Moreover, it did not always take place in the narthex: in Evergetis some of the monks stood inside the church and some in the παραπτέρυγον, probably the side aisle or the choros. See R. H. Jordan, The Synaxarion of the Monastery of the Theotokos Evergetis (Belfast, 2000), 474. In some Serbian churches a baptis- mal font was located in the narthex; see S. Curčič, "The Original Baptismal Font of Gračanica and its Iconographie Setting," Zbornik radova Narodnog Muzeja 9-10 (1979): 313-20. For a different inter- pretation, see Th. Papazotos, "Ή λεκάνη του αγιασμού του καθολικού του Τιμίου Προδρόμου και συναφή παραδείγματα άπο τή Μακεδονία," in Διεθνές Συνέδριο: Οι Σέρρες και περιοχή τους από τήν αρχαία στη μεταβυζαντινή κοινωνία (Thessalonike, 1998), 2:509-24, where there is evidence for the occasional use of the narthex for the service of the Blessing of the Waters. Confessions were occasionally heard in the narthex, as attested in the testament and typikon of Neilos Damilas for the con- vent of the Mother of God Pantanassa on Crete and in the typika of Theodora for the monastery tou Libos and the convent of SS. Kosmas and Damian. See u Neilos Damilas: Testament and Typikon of Neilos Damilas for the Convent of the Mother of God Pantanassa at Baionaia on Crete," in BMFD, 4:1473; "Anargyroi: Typikon of Theodora Palaiologina for the Convent of Sts. Kosmas and Damian in Constantinople," inBMFD, 3:1292; "Typikon of Lips," inBMFD, 3:1269. Hearing confessions, however, is not a liturgical activity. Very appropriately the narthex was also used for funerals and com- memorative services; see Bache, "La fonction funéraire" (n. 16 above), 28-31. See also S.

Interestingly, in commenting on the seventy-second canon of the Council in Troullo, Balsamon contradicts himself on this same point, as he claims that the narthex is not a church. The canonist argues: "Because every space dedicated to the Lord is called Kyriakos, even when it is not a church but maybe a narthex or another kind of holy space, the canon dictates that people should not dine within churches and within such spaces."43 Further along in the same commentary he makes this distinction clearer: "Because there is a difference between churches and narthexes along with other spaces dedicated to the Lord/44 John, metropolitan of Chalcedon and a con- temporary of Balsamon, provides a more explicit answer addressing the issue of burials in a church. To the ques- tion "Is it proper to bury inside the church?" John replies: "It is not. As the cemeteries should be strictly separated [from the churches]. But in the narthex, it is allowed."45 Some curious uses of the narthex, namely as a space for occasional drinking and eating by the monas- tic community, sometimes related to the celebration of major feasts, indicate the same rather informal atti- tude toward the narthex.46 The tenth-century Rule of Athanasios for the Great Lavra in Mount Athos instructs that after the conclusion of the services on Holy Saturday, the monks should partake of blessed bread and "about two servings of wine in the narthex."47 The Rule of Nicholas for the monastery of Saint Nicholas of Kasoulon (written in 116 o) specifies that on Pentecost Sunday and on the vigils of Christmas and Epiphany (if those happen to fall on a Saturday or Sunday) the monks do not go to the refectory, but eat the klaston (unconsecrated bread distributed at the end of the liturgy) and drink one cup of wine in the narthex.48 The Rule of Neilos for the monastery of Machairas in Cyprus (written in 1210) dictates that "On Holy Saturday let there be a collation only in the narthex after the dismissal of the liturgy."49 The Evergetis typikon and its related typika indicate that a light meal in the narthex was a common occurrence.50 Mullett and A. Kirby (Belfast, 1997), 316, n. 28. On the liturgical use of the narthex in Constantinopolitan churches of the early Christian period see T. F. Mathews, The Early Churches of Constantinople: Architecture and Liturgy (University Park, PA, 1971), 125-27, 139- 49,esp.l45. There is a tendency to interpret the decorative programs of the narthex as results of liturgical influence. See, for example, B. Todič, "L'influence de la liturgie sur la décoration peinte du narthex de Sopočani," in Drevne-russkoe iskusstvo: Rus', Vizantiia, Balkány XIII vek, ed. A. L. Batalov (St. Petersburg, 1997), 43-58. Although a comprehensive treatment of the narthex decoration still needs to be written, it is evident that these programs were far from stan- dardized. In fact, they present great variety in both the selection of iconographie themes and their arrangement. Furthermore, the pro- ponents of the liturgical influences, with the exception of the scene of the Washing of the Feet, have yet to provide a secure connection between a service that took place in the narthex and the iconography ofthat space. 43 "Έπει ούν πάς τόπος, τφ Κυρίω ανατεθειμένος, Κυριάκος λέγεται, καν μη εκκλησία εστίν, άλλα πρόναος τυχόν, ή 'έτερον τι ιερόν, διορίζεται ό κανών, μη συμποσιάζειν τινας εν έκκλησίαις, ή έν τοιούτοις τόποις."

(Munich, 1977), 658. 46 For this meal, sometimes called kataklysmos, see G. Nicholl, "A Contribution to the Archaeological Interpretation of Typika: The Case of the Narthex," in Work and Worship, 285-308. Nicholl "ritu- alizes" what is evidently a quick meal to sustain the monks or nuns after a particularly lengthy service or a long period of fasting, or on a day where a regular meal was not permitted. 47 "Ath.

The typika of Machairas and Mamas also relate to Evergetis. For the collation see BMFD, 1:116-17, n. 27. In some instances the narthex is the starting point of the pro- cession from the church to the refectory after the celebration of the liturgy; see A.-M. Talbot, "Mealtime in Monasteries: The Culture of the Byzantine Refectory," in L. Brubaker and K. Linardou, eds., Eat, Drink, and Be Merry (Luke 12:1c): Food and Wine in Byzantium (Ashgate, 2007), 112. DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 63</page><page sequence="10">цб I VASILEIOSMARINIS This delimitation of importance and sanctity was also true for the naos, with the sanctuary being the most sacred space. Already in the sixth century pseudo- Dionysius instructed that during the funeral service, if the deceased is a cleric, his body should be placed in front of the altar (that is, in the sanctuary). If he is a monk or a layman, he is to be put in front of the entrance to the sanctuary (evidently a less sacred space).51 A similar hierarchy of space, reflecting the hierarchy and sanctity of offices, is offered by Symeon of Thessalonike. Writing about the placement of the deceased during the funer- ary service Symeon instructs that "the bishops should be placed closer to the sanctuary; the priests and the other members of the clergy after them [i.e., further to the west]. As for the laity, they should be placed around the doors of the naos. This custom is more rigorously observed still in monasteries: they sing [the funeral] for the abbots and clergy inside the naos but for the com- mon monks and laymen they do it in the narthex."52 Ioasaph, metropolitan of Ephesos in the fifteenth cen- tury, accepts as a fact this distinction between the litur- gical center of the naos and the "secondary" side spaces. When asked about burying the dead in the church he replies, "The Holy Canons prohibit this. However, it happens in the sides of the naos and not in the center, nor close to the sanctuary."53 Although the Byzantines did not develop a sys- tematic approach to church burial, evidence from these texts indicates that different degrees of holiness were assigned to the various parts of a Byzantine church, and that this demarcation was connected to the liturgical importance of each space. Thus, the sanctuary and the central bay, the stage where most of the liturgy was per- formed, were considered the holiest. These areas came to represent the church as a whole, and, in accordance with the pertinent imperial and ecclesiastical regula- tions, they were off-limits for burial. On the other hand, less significance was attached to the narthex and the side aisles of the naos, spaces where the liturgical activ- ity was restricted to minor services. This gradation of holiness provides the theoretical, albeit unarticulated, justification for the placement of tombs in those areas of secondary importance. Judging from archaeological evidence in the church of the Theotokos tou Libos, this concept had been accepted as valid in Constantinople as early as the early tenth century if not before. The Tombs in the Church of Theotokos During Macridy's investigation of the Lips complex he accidentally discovered a series of undisturbed tombs inside and outside the church of the Theotokos (fig. 2, nos. i-io).54 Under the floor of the north church's narthex, five marble sarcophagi were discovered (figs. 3-4):55 four single ones (fig. 2, nos. 2-5) and one double (no. 6) containing six bodies in total. All the burials were arrayed in pairs, aligned with each of the three doors leading to the naos, with the corpses' heads located to the west and their feet to the east. Each sar- cophagus was covered with two roughly hewn stones and rested on a layer of tiles below.56 Macridy reports that the burials were found under a solid bed of mor- tar thirty-five centimeters thick. But judging from his photographs, the tombs were just a few centimeters below the level of the doorsill. Four of the sarcophagi 51 "Συναγαγών ό θείος Ιεράρχης &lt;τον&gt; Ιερόν χορό ν, εί μέν Ιερατικής έγεγόνει τάξεως ό κεκοιμημένος, έπίπροσθεν του θείου θυσιαστηρίου κατακλίνας αυτόν άπάρχεται της προς θεον ευχής και ευχαριστίας.

However, Symeon clearly discusses the funeral service. 53 "Εί δει θάπτειν έν εκκλησία λείψανον. και τοΰτο οι ιεροί κανόνες κωλύουσιν. πλην γίνεται δέ εις τα πλάγια του ναού καί ουκ εις το μέσον, ουδέ πλησίον του αγίου βήματος," Α.

These were decorated with a simple carved cross on the outside.57 The sarcophagus located in front of the south door to the naos (no. 6) was carved from a single block of stone and had two compartments. Early Christian anthropoid sarcophagi similar to those found in the Lips monastery may be seen in the courtyard of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.58 Two sarcophagi of this type were excavated near Manastir Mescidi.59 Macridy further reports the exca- vation of four more tombs "of different sizes" under the floor of the present-day outer ambulatory (fig. 2, nos. 7-10). Regrettably the excavator considered them later in date (second half of the fifteenth century) and the report says little about them. In Mamboury's plan we can see that one of the sarcophagi is of the anthropoid type (no. 9), and another contained the remains of a child (no. 10). Three of the tombs (nos. 7-9) were origi- nally under a vaulted porch that was later demolished, maybe during the construction of the outer ambulatory in the late thirteenth century. Another underground tomb (no. 1) was recorded in the north aisle of the naos of the church of Theotokos, located in the center of the aisle wall, just in front of the large tripartite window. Unfortunately there is no visual record of it, but according to Macridy 's description it was a typical cist tomb, dug in the ground, faced with marble slabs, and covered with a marble plaque resting on transverse iron bars. The iron nails found inside this burial would have come from a wooden coffin.60 Macridy suggests that this was the tomb of Andronikos II (1282-1328), who was indeed buried in Lips, although the excavator does not provide evidence for this identification.61 The tomb might indeed be of late Byzantine date, when it was more common to bury people within the naos, and in all likelihood it belonged to someone of significance. A close parallel in terms of location is found in the church of Blacherna in Arta, where two marble sar- cophagi (now much altered) for imperial family mem- bers were set against the north and south walls of the naos. The south tomb belonged to the despot Michael II Komnenos Doukas (1206-1266). The north tomb contained the remains of John and Michael, sons of Theodora Komnenodoukaina.62 Macridy dates the burials in the narthex of the church of Theotokos to the sixth century based on the style of the sarcophagi and on his idea that Constantine Lips restored an earlier sixth-century building, parts of which were incorporated into the tenth-century struc- ture. The 1960s investigations of Mango, Hawkins, and especially Megaw prove Macridy 's theory of a preexisting sixth-century foundation to be errone- ous. As for the date of the sarcophagi, the reuse of such early Christian and late antique commodities was very common in Byzantium, even among emper- ors.63 There is little doubt that the five tombs within the narthex and the four tombs just outside it belong to the middle Byzantine period. They certainly post- date the construction of the north church, given their perfect alignment with the doors of the naos and the narthex. The tombs predate Theodora's thirteenth- century renovation, since the type of burials in the south church is homogeneous and different from the tombs in the north church. Theodora's typikon, which is very explicit about burials in the church, does not prescribe that any such burial arrangement was to be made in the north church. Is it possible to suggest anything concrete about the identity of the people buried in the north church of the monastery tou Libos, despite the loss of hard archaeological evidence from the site? It has been argued that burying the dead in churches was a con- tinuation oiadsanctos burials, a very common practice in early Christian times. Pallas, Emmanouilidis, and others have argued that the transfer of relics to intra 57 Macridy, "Monastery of Lips," figs. 71, 73. 58 G .

Every consecrated church contained relics of martyrs which, during the service of the enkainia, were placed in or under the altar table, and the north church of the monastery tou Libos was no exception.65 Yet these relics, evidently just small frag- ments, were contained in very small reliquary boxes that were subsequently buried and sealed, thus becom- ing inaccessible. I know of no instances in which such relics were approached by the faithful or venerated in any way, and the name of the martyr to whom they belonged was rarely, if ever, recorded. Thus enkainia relics had a function different from that of other relics, which were kept in churches and monasteries, or, in the early Christian period, in martyria.66 A plethora of information from the typika of Byzantine monasteries indicates that one of the fore- most reasons, if not the foremost reason, for establish- ing a monastery was the salvation of the soul of the patron, in exchange for his or her commitment to glo- rify God through the foundation. One's soul was also helped by the continuous and regular prayers and com- memorations that the monastic community offered on behalf of the patron and his or her family.67 This idea is beautifully encapsulated in the testament (written in 1232) of presbyter Alexios Tesaites, who writes, "Those who erect churches, they do it for three reasons: first to praise God; second, to pray on behalf of the emper- or's rule; third to commemorate those who are buried there and the orthodox everywhere."68 The first two reasons are rather generic, but commemoration of the dead buried in those churches and monasteries (and we can safely assume that Alexios refers to the patrons of these foundations) more explicitly expresses the hopes of the patrons. A similar sentiment is expressed in a text by Michael, bishop of Demetrias, in his discussion of Nicholas/Ioasaph Maliasenos in the thirteenth cen- tury: "Because, as I see, many other chapels and pious institutions were founded by him [Ioasaph] for the sal- vation of his soul and the continuous commemoration of the orthodox emperors and of all Christians."69 Although the tomb of the patron or founder could have been placed at various locations in the monastery, the most desirable spot was inside the church, specifi- cally in the narthex or, less commonly, in the side aisles. There is both textual and archaeological evidence dem- onstrating that patrons, along with prominent mem- bers of the monastic and ecclesiastical community, were buried in narthexes.70 When Nikephoros, the founder of the monastery tou Medikiou in Bithynia, died in 813, his body was "transferred with sacred hymnody and candles and incense, and was deposited in the church of the archangel, to the left part of the narthex, as he, when still alive, had arranged for [his] tomb."71 Niketas, his successor, was also buried "at the tomb of our common father Nikephoros, which he built for himself when he was still alive to the left of the narthex."72 Saint Kliment of Ohrid (d. 916) 64 D.

Although the Kosmosoteira does not have a nar- thex proper, Ousterhout convincingly proposes that Isaac's tomb was located in the northwest corner bay.78 In this case, the three western bays of the naos took up the frequent burial function of the narthex. This list is by no means exhaustive, but rather is indicative of the widespread custom in the middle and late Byzantine periods of burying patrons, along with other eminent members of the monastic and ecclesiastical communities, in the narthex.79 The evi- dence stands against the supposition of Gordana Babic that narthex burials belonged to people who could not afford to build a separate chapel.80 Many of the interments mentioned here were of persons capable of building a chapel. Burial in the narthex was not a second-best choice for these individuals, but a desired place for burial. It is very likely, in my view, that the tombs inside and outside the narthex in the church of Theotokos tou Libos belonged to Constantine Lips and members of his family and/or distinguished members of the monastic community.81 Indeed, it is tempting to hypothesize that Constantine Lips occupied one of the two sar- cophagi aligned with the central door to the nave (fig. 2, nos. 4-5). In this context, the child buried outside 73 "To δέ θεΐον αυτού σώμα . . . τω έν τη μονή μνημείω ένετέθη, δπερ αυτός οίκείαις χερσί κατεσκεύασε κατά το δεξιον του" πρόναου μέρος," Α.

DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 63</page><page sequence="15">Tombs and Burials in the Monastery tou Libos in Constantinople I 161 the southwestern door of the narthex could have been a member of Lips' family.82 Mamboury's plan indicates that all the tombs were aligned with the door openings, and all faced east. This arrangement of the burials most certainly relates to Byzantine ideas about the Parousia, the Second Coming of Christ, which would begin in the east, and during which all the dead would be called from the tombs.83 Prayers recited during the funeral service, already found in the Barberini Euchologion, constantly refer to the "hope for the resurrection of the dead," an ancient Christian belief.84 This placement of the tombs testifies to not only the Byzantine conviction in Christ's second advent but the importance of securing a good view of it. The Tombs in the Church of Saint John Twelve masonry tombs (fig. 2, nos. I-XII) and three ossuaries (fig. 2, Α-C) were discovered in the naos and narthex of the Palaiologan south church dur- ing Macridy's investigation, along with another seven in the outer ambulatory (nos. XII-XIX), some set in arcosolia.85 Human remains had probably been cleared already by the fifteenth century, when the church was converted into a mescid. As is the case with the north church, there is no photographic record of the tombs, and therefore one has to rely solely on Macridy's description and Mamboury's plan. The tombs were relatively small, measuring 2.50-2.80 meters in length, 0.90-1.40 meters in width, and 1.40-2.00 meters in depth. The lower part of each tomb narrowed to a space of about 0.60 by 0.60 m.86 Macridy reports the discovery of three ossuaries.87 One of them, equipped with a sliding lid, was placed against the east wall of the narthex. Another was found in the naos in the eastern niche of the southern aisle, along with a smaller trian- gular ossuary next to it. Late Byzantine sources pertinent to the burials in the church of Saint John and the outer ambulatory are plentiful. The typikon of Theodora stipulates that the church of Saint John was to serve as a mausoleum for her family. It outlines very specific instructions concerning the burials in the south church, including Theodora's own burial: It is now time to be mindful of death, since there is no one "that lives and never sees death." First I will make clear to my family and descendants my wishes concerning my own burial. The body of my daughter is buried to the right of the entrance to the church of [Saint John] the Forerunner. My tomb and that of my honored mother (for I cannot bear to be separated from her even after my death) should be built after the intervening door. In the future any of my children or sons- in-law who request during their lifetime to be laid to rest here shall be suitably buried. The same shall apply to my grandsons and granddaughters, daughters-in-law, and the husbands of grand- daughters, for all of whom there are to be annual commemorations. The opposite side, on your left as you leave for the old church of the Virgin, will be totally reserved for whatever purpose desired by my son the emperor.88 82 It was not uncommon for parents to dedicate their off- spring to a monastery at an early age. Such was the case, for exam- ple, in Patmos; see " Christodoulos: Rule, Testament and Codicil of Christodoulos for the Monastery of St. John the Theologian on Patmos," in BMFD, 2:596. Christodoulos himself joined "a flock of monks" when he was still a child (579). The typikon of Lips also men- tions acceptance not only of children but also of babies; see "Typikon of Lips" (n. 42 above), 1271; Delehaye, Deux typica (n. 10 above), 116. However, I find it unlikely that any child would have received such a privileged burial. 83 E. Peterson, "Die Einholung des Kyrios," Zeitschrift für sys- tematische Theologie 7 (1929): 682-702; Y.

The first was Constantine, the younger brother of Andronikos II, who had been condemned and imprisoned since 1293 and died on 5 May 1304. The passage from Pachymeres states that Constantine "was buried like the common men in the outermost tombs," probably indicating that his tomb was located in the outer ambulatory.91 The next person known to have been buried in Lips is Eirene, first wife of Andronikos III, who died in Rhaidestos on 16 August 1324.92 She was followed by Andronikos II Palaiologos, son of Theodora, who died on 13 February 1332.93 Last to be interred was Anna, the Russian first wife of John VIII Palaiologos, who died in the plague of 1418.94 A funerary stele now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum depicts a nun called Maria, "the faithful sebaste and a daughter of Palaiologos."95 Even though it was a stray find, it was quickly attributed to the monas- tery tou Libos. The identification of this Maria remains elusive. If the stele indeed comes from Lips, she was probably one of Theodora's descendants. Therefore, there is information to justify the existence of some seven tombs. Unfortunately, with the exception of the typikon, none of these sources specifies the locations of the tombs. Very limited information comes from Theodore Metochites, who alludes to Theodora's tomb in his funeral oration for the beloved empress. Metochites comments that the empress had a "long time ago pre- pared everything regarding the burial, the tomb and its covering (?), as it is appropriate, and the funerary fixtures (?) and written petitions."96 His language, τε παίδων δστις άν έπιτάξειε περιών ένθάδε καταπεσεΐν, και των επί θυγατράσι γαμβρών, προσηκόντως κατατεθήσεται.

Macridy believed without reason that Eudokia was the one buried in the south church. However, Mango and Hawkins noted that Eudokia died in Trebizond and was, in all likelihood, buried there. Anna was also dead before 1301. According to Pachymeres it was at that date that her widowed husband ("την συνοικούσαν προ χρόνων άποβαλών"), Michael Koutroules, married the daughter of the Serbian krajl Terterij; see A.

The words στέγαι and έπιπλα might refer to the sculptural and otherwise decoration of the tomb, parts of which may have survived.97 Equally unclear is the meaning of the written petitions/prayers that Theodora had prepared. Mango suggests that the phrase implies the typikon, whereas Talbot takes it as a reference to an epitaph.98 I believe, however, that the phrase indicates the specific instructions that Theodora left in the typikon regard- ing the memorial services (an appropriate, albeit liberal, translation for the word δεήσεις) for herself and her fam- ily. These instructions concern the annual commemora- tions, the number of loaves of bread to be consecrated in memory of her family, and the stauria (eucharistie bread offering in the shape of a cross) to be offered every Saturday.99 Despite the typikon's detailed instructions, there is still some uncertainty regarding the precise loca- tion of the tombs of Theodora, her daughter, and her mother, Eudokia.100 It has been assumed that Theodora and her mother were buried in separate graves, but the wording of the relevant passage of the typikon ("εν δεξιά μεν εισιόντι τον του Προδρόμου νεών ό νεκρός της έμής προκατατεθείς εστί θυγατρός, μετά δε την μεταξύ πύλην ο έμος και της έμης τίμιας μητρός έγερθήσεται") might imply that they were placed in the same tomb. This was a common practice, as is clear from the lists of imperial tombs in the capital.101 Where was Theodora's tomb located? Macridy suggests that Theodora's daughter was buried in one of the tombs found at the west end of the south aisle (fig. 2, nos. V-VII), while Theodora and her mother were buried in the two larger tombs located in the middle of the south aisle (nos. VIII-IX). Mango and Hawkins, on 97 The arch with busts of the apostles discovered by Macridy is of Palaiologan date and originally belonged to a tomb niche in the south church, maybe that of Theodora.

In most cases the husband and wife were buried together, although mother and son or daughter was not unusual either. For example, Constantine I and his mother Helena shared the same sarcophagus, as did Theophano, first wife of Leo VI, and her daughter Eudokia. See J. J.

Photo courtesy of Dumbarton Oaks Image Collections and Fieldwork Archives the other hand, argue from the typikon's instructions that the tombs were located in the arcosolia of the south church: Theodora's in the eastern one (where ossuaries A and В were located) and her daughter s in the western (no. VII).102 When Mango and Hawkins surveyed the building, there were still remains of mosaic decoration on the back walls of these spaces (figs. $-6).103 In the middle of the eastern arcosolium was a standing figure with her hands folded over her breast, which they identi- fied as Theodora (fig. $). Very little can be said about this mosaic. The inscription that accompanied the mosaic was completely illegible. The western arcosolium (where tomb VII was located) preserved the remains of an inde- cipherable inscription as well as a figure bearing another fragmentary inscription ... νια (μον)αχ(ή), which accord- ing to Mango and Hawkins was probably the monastic name of Theodora's daughter (fig. 6). More recently, Alice-Mary Talbot has suggested that this should be read as Ευγενία, the monastic name of Theodora herself, and therefore her tomb would have been located in the western niche.104 The description of the location of the tombs in the typikon, vague in its terminology, allows for two possibilities. The tomb of Theodora's daughter may be located in the narthex of the church of Saint John ("to the right of the entrance to the church," see the Greek text cited above), where Macridy found three tombs (fig. 2, nos. X-XII). In this arrangement, Theodora's own tomb and her mother's are located "after the inter- vening door" in the naos. Alternatively, the daughter's tomb may be situated in the western arcosolium of the south aisle in the naos of Saint John (no. VII). In this case, Theodora's tomb would be located in the eastern arcosolium after the intervening door on the south wall that led outside the naos. This had been suggested earlier by Mango and Hawkins and corresponds to the instructions in the typikon. Moreover, the tomb in the southeastern niche was unquestionably the most privileged, by virtue of its closeness to the sanctu- ary. Nevertheless, there is a difficulty in this solution. Although Macridy does not provide any explanation for his identification of the tombs, the reasoning is that in the southeastern niche, where it would make more sense to place Theodora's tomb, he discovered an ossu- ary separated into three compartments, along with a smaller one next to it (fig. 2, A-B). I would like to suggest that Theodora was indeed buried in the southeastern niche and that what Macridy found was in essence a secondary burial, undoubtedly after all the available spots had been filled. The sheer number of tombs that Macridy discovered in the south church (set in arcosolia or in the inner ambulatory of the church), along with the three ossuaries, indicates 102 Mango and Hawkins, "Additional Notes," 301-3. See also Mango, "Sépultures" (n. и above), 106. 103 Macridy also briefly reports the existence of mosaics in these spaces without, unfortunately, being very specific.

Secondary burials were not as uncommon in Byzantium as one might think, even for members of the imperial family. For example, as soon as Leo VI (886-912) became emperor, he had the remains of Michael III (842-867) dug up and brought from Chrysopolis to Constantinople. There, the bones were placed in a sarcophagus and interred in the church of the Holy Apostles.105 The list of imperial tombs in De ceri- moniis offers further evidence for secondary burials in ossuaries, similar to the one in the church of Saint John tou Libos. For example, in the passage referring to Justin II and his wife Sophia it reads: "It should be known that in the convent of ta hustinou, in the church of the holy apostle Thomas, in a sarcophagus made of green Thessalian stone used to lie the body of the emperor Justin and that of Sophia, his wife. Their remains were disentombed and were deposited in the same monastery in a small coffin of Proconnesian, that is Pikrimean, stone, in which there is the inscription 'ossuary of Alexander the DomestikosV'106 It is not entirely clear why the remains of this imperial couple were exhumed and placed in an ossuary that, judging from the inscrip- tion, originally belonged to a certain Alexander.107 Even more telling is Porphyrogennetos's descrip- tion of secondary burials in the monastery of Saint Euphemia en to Petrio,108 where a small sculpted ossuary (larnakidion) contained the bones of the two daughters 105 "ο δε αυτός Λέων μετά το αύτοκρατορήσαι . . . έξήγαγεν Μιχαήλ εκ του τάφου, και εβαλεν έν γλωσσοκόμω κυπαρισσίνω· και έπι κραβάτου θέντες και σκεπάσαντες βασιλικώς τε τιμήσαντες, μεθ' ΰμνων και τιμής πολλής, επομένων έκεΐσε και των αδελφών αύτοΰ, ήγαγεν εις τους αγίους αποστόλους και άπέθετο ένλάρνακι." The inci- dent is related in Georgius Monachus Continuatus; see Bekker, ed., Theophanes Continuatus, Ioannes Cameniata, Symeon Magister, Georgius Monachus, 849. See also Grierson, "Tombs and Obits" (n. 12 above), 57. 106 "Ίστέον, ότι έν τη γυναικία [sic] μονή τα Ίουστίνου, έν τω ναω του αγίου αποστόλου Θωμά, έν λάρνακι άπο λίθου πρασίνου Θεσσαλού άπέκειτο το σώμα Ίουστίνου του βασιλέως και Σοφίας τής γυναικός αύτοΰ. και έξηνέχθη τα τούτων λείψανα, και κατετέθη έν τή αυτή μονή έν χαμοσορίου από λίθου Προικονησίου ήτουν Πικριμαίου, έν φ και έπιγέγραπται· 'γλοσσόκομος [sic] Αλεξάνδρου Δομεστίκου,'" Reiske, ed., De cerimoniis (n. юг above), 1:646. 107 It is possible that their sarcophagus was used by Leo VI for the body of Michael HI. On this topic see ibid., 2:760-61; Downey, '"The Tombs of the Byzantine Emperors" (n. 102 above), 48-51; Grierson, "Tombs and Obits," 9-10. 108 For the location of this monastery see Janin, Géographie ecclé- siastique (п. 5 above), 127-29. of Basil I, along with those of Zoe Karbonopsina, the mother of Constantine VII: "It should be known that in the eastern part of the south aisle of the same church [of Prodromos] across from the sarcophagus, a small sculpted ossuary is located in which Anna and Helen, the daughters of Basil, the Christ-loving emperor, are reposing, along with Zoe the mother of Constantine the God-crowned and Porphyrogennetos the blessed emperor and grandson of Basil."109 Again, the reason for this secondary burial is unclear and it is worth noting that the remains of the two daughters of Basil, who were not related to Zoe, were placed in an ossuary with her. Yet, the situation in the monastery of Saint Euphemia must have been similar to that in the church of Saint John: several members of the family of Basil I were bur- ied inside the church there, and we can speculate that there was soon a need for more space; hence some of the remains were exhumed and placed in ossuaries. It is, therefore, safe to assume that what Macridy found was actually a secondary burial, namely an ossu- ary with three compartments, which may have origi- nally contained the bones of Theodora, her mother, and even her daughter. If this suggestion is correct, then we can explain both the arrangement of tombs according to the typikon and the ossuary excavated by Macridy. Some Conclusions Focusing on the monastery tou Libos, the most extraor- dinary example of burials within Byzantine churches in Constantinople, I have investigated the origins and theological context for burial within churches during the middle and late Byzantine periods in Constantinople and elsewhere. This tradition does not represent a continuation of the ad sanctos burials, as has been previously proposed. Rather, the reason for the desire to be buried within a church building was soteriological: the souls of the deceased would benefit 109 "ίστέον, δτι έν τώ προς άνατολήν δεξιφ μέρει του αύτοΰ ευκτήριου, απέναντι τοϋ λάρνακος ΐσταται λαρνάκιον μικρόν άνάγλυφον, έν φ άπόκεινται Άννα και 'Ελένη, θυγατέρες Βασιλείου του φιλοχρίστου δεσπότου, και Ζωή ή μήτηρ Κωνσταντίνου του θεοστέπτου και Πορφυρογέννητου του μακαρίου βασιλέως του έγ/όνου Βασιλείου," see Reiske, tà., De cerimoniis, 1:648-49. See also the descriptions of the burials in the monastery ton Gastrion, where the lower jaw (!) of Caesar Bardas is kept in a similar small ossuary; ibid., 1:648. DUMBARTON OAKS PAPERS | 63</page><page sequence="20">l66 I VASILEIOSMARINIS from the continuous celebration of the liturgy and the prayers of the monastics and visitors. The problem of canonical regulations prohibiting church burials (if it ever was a problem) was addressed by placing the tombs in areas of secondary liturgical importance. Whether this was a compromise cannot be known. It was surely common practice, justified by an unspoken "grada- tion of holiness" in Byzantine churches, which applied to other aspects of religious practice as well. The best representations of this hierarchy are buildings of the ambulatory type, including the church of Saint John in the monastery tou Libos, where the bema and the cen- tral bay are clearly cut off from the rest of the church. It is not accidental that most, if not all, of the surviving ambulatory churches in Constantinople were funer- ary in character. A tomb somewhere within a church was highly desired, as the frequency of multiple buri- als attests, and was usually reserved for distinguished clerics, monastics, and laypeople. Moreover, abundant archaeological and textual evidence indicates that the privilege of church burial belonged to the founder of the monastery, who could come from any of the aforementioned social categories. Thus, it is likely that some of the tombs in the narthex of the north church belonged to Constantine Lips and members of his family. Although the exact location of Lips's tomb is unknown, the monastery's second founder, Theodora Palaiologina, was unquestionably buried in the church of Saint John along with several members of her fam- ily. The wording of her instructions in the typikon sug- gests the possibility that she shared a tomb with her mother - a well-attested practice among imperial rela- tives. Theodora's tomb was without a doubt located in the southeastern niche of the church's inner ambula- tory, where Macridy discovered two ossuaries. I suggest that the ossuaries are a testimony to yet another com- mon but largely undocumented practice, namely that of secondary burials. Is it conceivable that Theodora had to share her privileged place within the church with others? The evidence certainly points to that conclu- sion. But because the archaeological evidence coming from Constantinople is tantalizingly incomplete, these conclusions must remain in part provisional.
