<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ritual Efficacy, Hasidic Mysticism and "Useless Suffering" in the Warsaw Ghetto Don Seeman Emory University "Learn to think with pain."1 Between November 1940 and April 1943, nearly four hundred thousand Jews were imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto and systematically murdered. Among them was Rabbi Kalonymos Shapira (1889-1943), who had founded one of the largest Hasidic academies in Warsaw in 1923.2 Before the war, he had also written extensively on the discipline of the emotions as a component of prophetic training and spiritual education. Overtaken by the genocide of Jews in Europe, however, Rabbi Shapira turned his attention in the Ghetto writings to consideration of the rupture that these events entailed and their implications for his pre-war cosmology. A reading attuned to anthropological concerns is called for because even excellent historical and theological accounts have typically failed to privilege the ritual and cosmological dimensions of Rabbi Shapira's concern, or their relationship to his pre-war writings on emotion and religious subjectivity.3 Another way of saying 1 Maurice Blanchot, The Writing of the Disaster (trans. Ann Smock; Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 1995) 44. 2 The school was named Daas Moshe after Rabbi Shapira's father-in-law, who took charge of his education at the age of three, when his father, Rabbi Elimelekh of Grodzisk, died. This was the first in a series of deep personal losses that characterized Rabbi Shapira's life before the holocaust, including the premature death of his wife, Rachel Hayyah Miriam.

Geertz exemplifies the trend when he asserts that the problem of suffering "from a religious point of view ... is not how to avoid suffering . . . but how to suffer, how to make of physical pain, personal loss ... or the helpless contemplation of others' agony something bearable, supportable- something, as we say, sufferable," which is really to say, "meaningful" and "symbolically coherent."5 This intervention is important, given our society's valorization of technical efficacy to the exclusion of much else.

Sometimes this may well relate to the production of cultural and religious meaning, or to the enactment of social relationships that have been studied by anthropologists. But I will emphasize that ritual is also practiced for the sake of changes in the phenomenal world such as healing or destruction of enemies, or to render shifts in subjectivity that are not limited in any way to the promotion of symbolic coherence or the representation of cultural and religious tropes. A good overview is given by Thomas Csordas and E. Lewton in "Practice, Performance and Experience in Ritual Healing," Transcultural Psychiatry 35 (1998) 435-512. For a related argument on the importance of shifting Hasidic studies towards a focus on ritual efficacy, see Don Seeman, "Emotion, Martyrdom and the Work of Ritual in R. Mordecai Leiner of Izbica's Mei Ha-Shiloah" AJS Review 27 (2003) 253-80; Moshe Idel, Hasidism: Between Ecstasy and Magic (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995).

They were linked by his overall concern with embodied subjectivity, and especially by the discipline of the emotions that he taught. Scholars have been reluctant to confront the hard limits placed on meaning- making by radical suffering, which can be both world and consciousness destroying.7 The destruction of European Jewry raises this concern in an especially urgent way, as Lawrence Langer has argued.8 But whereas Langer depicts almost all accounts of meaning in Holocaust narratives as misguided or even bad-faith attempts to quiet the "alarmed vision" of radical demoralization, Rabbi Shapira's Ghetto writings exemplify a more complicated and provisional approach. As a communal and religious leader in the Warsaw Ghetto, he could permit himself neither the comfort of seamless "webs of significance" described by Geertz nor the severe self-consistency of their denial. Like the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, he grappled with the phenomenological implications of "useless suffering" that had lost its moral mooring, or "use," because it could no longer be assimilated to any system of secular or religious theodicy.9 His own response, however, was hermeneutic and literary rather than philosophic in nature. Through his sometimes startling interpretations of classic texts, he attempted to create a discursive space for the experience of uselessness, but also to frame that experience in terms of distinctive ritual and affective strategies that would allow his followers- and the cosmos itself- to resist collapse. 6 See Wayne Proudfoot, Religious Experience (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985). The shared genealogy of hermeneutic approaches to ritual in the social sciences and certain forms of modern Christianity has already been noted by Talal Asad in Genealogies of Religion (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1993). It may be objected that anthropologists focus on shared public meanings of ritual practice whereas theologians like Schleiermacher insist on the ineffably private nature of religious experience, yet both Geertz and Schleiermacher seek to defend the autonomy of a sphere called "religion" by asserting that it deals uniquely with matters that cannot be falsified through its claims to verifiable truth or pragmatic efficacy.

His preoccupation with nervous disorder as a paradigm for religious phenomena such as prophecy is especially noteworthy in this regard, because it sets him apart to some extent from earlier Hasidic writers. It is difficult to assess the Ghetto writings without reference to these pre-war reflections, because it is here that the ritual management of subjectivity and emotional experience that preoccupied Rabbi Shapira during the Holocaust years is first revealed as a pillar of his religious project. The pedagogical tracts grew explicitly out of Rabbi Shapira's profound sense of crisis in Polish Jewish society between the wars. Like many of his colleagues, he was appalled and disheartened by the powerful tide of secularism that was evident among the young, and by the Jewish community's increasingly precarious political and economic situation.11 Confronting this situation, he argued that an epochal change had taken place among European youth that rendered traditional, hierarchy-based educational strategies irrelevant: Why, in previous generations, did any type of education at all seem to suffice? The vast majority of every teacher's students and every father's children became servants of God. This is no longer the case today. . . . The youth has arisen and considers itself mature before its time. . . . Our sages have already warned us about this from the beginning: "In the time of the heralding of the Messiah, arrogance will multiply." . . . Sometimes [today] we are astounded to see literal children bearing such a spirit of independence and courage . . . [that they seem to] consider themselves to be grown men.12 10 All of Rabbi Shapira's surviving publications are in Hebrew. The wartime essays, which were probably delivered orally in Yiddish on the Sabbath before Rabbi Shapira wrote them in Hebrew, were published as Kalonymos Kalman Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh (Jerusalem: Hasidei Piasezno: 1960) and subsequently translated as Sacred Fire: Torah from the Years of Fury 1939-1942 (trans. J. Hershy Worch; Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson: 2000). His pre-war homiletic volume is published as Derekh ha-Melekh (Jerusalem: Hasidei Piasezno, 1991). Pedagogic works include Hakhsharat ha-Avrekhimy Mavo ha-She'arim and Tzav ve-Zeruz, all of which are published under the same cover as Hakhsharat ha-Avreikhim (Jerusalem: Hasidei Piasezno, 1962). A meditative handbook, Bnei Mahashavah Tovah (Jerusalem: Hasidei Piasezno, 1989), has appeared in English as Conscious Community (trans. Andrea Cohen-Kiener; Northvale, N. J. : Jason Arononson, 1 989). The only volume to achieve widespread publication during his lifetime was however his first pedagogic tract, Hovat ha-Talmidim (Jerusalem: Oraysoh, 1990), which has been translated as A Student's Obligation: Advice from the Rebbe of the Warsaw Ghetto (trans. Micha Oddenheimer; Northvale, N.J.: Jason Aronson, 1991). Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Hebrew in this article are my own. 11 See Piekarz, Ideological Trends, 377. 12 Shapira, Hovat ha-Talmidim, 15.</page><page sequence="5">DON SEEMAN 469 Rabbi Shapira perceived this trend to be irreversible, and although he could hardly describe it as other than arrogance [hutzpah], he also makes clear that it bears within itself a form of messianic potential, which is why he addresses the educational tracts directly to young people who are now called to take personal responsibility for their own spiritual and moral growth.13 Like the educational reformer Janusz Korczak, who also spent his last years in the Warsaw Ghetto not far from Rabbi Shapira- and who went willingly to his death rather than abandon his young students- Rabbi Shapira argues that youths must now be treated as independent moral agents.14 Arousal and management of the emotions were indispensable to this project. The only one of Rabbi Shapira's major manuscripts to see publication during his lifetime was Hovat ha-Talmidim ("The Obligation of Students"), which first appeared in 1932. Near the beginning of this work, he argues that only an emotional approach to Jewish education would stem the tide of disaffection evident among the young: It is difficult for the youth of our generation, whose emotions [hitragshuyot] and passions [hitpa'aluyot] have already been hardened and matured, to feel a sense of connection to [religious] principles through dry intellect alone We must pierce through to their soul, to arouse and inflame it, and to allow them to experience ... the sweetness of even a slight illumination of the supernal light.15 This was no mere rhetoric. The experience of "a slight illumination of the supernal light" had a definite cosmological referent for Rabbi Shapira, and implied the programmatic induction of young students into Hasidic mysticism. This was also an early statement of his preoccupation with emotional damping as a primary danger to social and religious continuity in the Jewish community. Students needed to be "aroused" and "inflamed," according to Rabbi Shapira, and to have their imaginative capacities intensified, even though they previously would have been considered 13 The "arrogance that heralds the coming of the Messiah" [hutzpah de-iqveta de-meshiha\ is a Talmudic expression (b. Sotah 49a) deployed by many modern traditionalists struggling to make sense of the massive changes, desolations and large-scale defections of the modern period. For just a few examples from rabbis with a wide variety of different outlooks on modernity, see Shapira, Bnei Makashavah Tovah 12; Rabbi Elhanan Bunim Wasserman, Kovetz Ma'amarim (Jerusalem: Gitler Brothers, 1991) 106-7 and Gershon Greenberg, "Elhanan Wasserman 's Response to the Growing Catastrophe in Europe: The Role of Ha'gra and Hofets Hayim Upon His Thought," The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 10 (2000) 171-104; Benjamin Ish Shalom, Rav Avraham Yitzhak HaCohen Kook: Between Rationalism and Mysticism (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993) 59, 89, 160.

Agitations of the Soul One of the reasons that increased affect was so important to Hasidic writers in general, and to Rabbi Shapira in particular, was that emotions were conceived as intermediate points in a scheme of divine emanation (hishtalshelui) that linked abstract thought to coarse matter. He probably would have approved the anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo's suggestion that scholars treat emotion as "embodied thought in which I am personally involved," but he would also have attached an important cosmological proviso.17 For Hasidism, the "embodiment of thought" in human emotion participates in a cascade of divine vitality (often described as "light" or "abundance") into the mundane, phenomenal world. Vitality is "drawn down" through a series of increasingly narrow "vessels," each of which is identified with a different faculty of human thought, emotion, or action. Emotional experience is thus conceived as a kind of divine substance, sacred at its core despite the appearance of pollution sometimes occasioned by its bodily context- "like clear water," Rabbi Shapira writes, "in a filthy glass."18 The content of emotional life is crucial to both mystical reflection and ritual practice because through attentiveness to emotional life and its source, human beings can attain privileged access to their own hidden continuity with divine subjectivity. Many of these teachings are inherited from older schools of Jewish mysticism, but the Hasidic revolution that began in the eighteenth century elevated anthropopathic correspondence to new importance. The founders of Hasidism enacted a shift in focus away from theosophical speculation on the dynamic process of divine emanation toward what Scholem called a "mystical psychology" focused on the dynamic structure of human experience.19 Anthropopathic correspondence between human emotional life and aspects of unfolding divinity meant that adepts could learn to seek understanding of one through reflection upon the other. "With every one of the endless stages of the theosophical world corresponding to a given state of the soul," Scholem famously remarks, "Kabbalism becomes an instrument of psychological analysis and self knowledge ... the precision of which is not infrequently rather astounding."20 In Rabbi Shapira's words, the founders of Hasidism revealed "the 16 See Wacks, "Emotion and Enthusiasm"; Piekarz, Ideological Trends, 374. 17 Michelle Z. Rosaldo, "Toward an Anthropology of Self and Feeling," in Culture Theory: Essays on Mind, Self and Emotion (ed. Richard Shweder and Robert Levine; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984) 143. 18 Shapira, Hovat ha-Talmidim, 98. 19 Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schoken, 1941) 341. 20 Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">DON SEEMAN 471 correspondence between the various levels of the soul as it emanates from the lofty divine realm down into the body, and the stages of contraction represented by the various worlds," and he frequently avers that his own willingness to engage in mystical speculation is limited to that which can be revealed through the intimacy of human experience.21 An important but often underestimated corollary of this approach is that the shifting contours of human experience also gain a purchase on cosmic reality through practices like ritual weeping, whereby adepts- both Hasidic and non- Hasidic- sought to shift the divine visage toward compassion.22 Ritual aspects of mourning and celebration as well as the performance of mundane acts such as eating or walking with proper intentionality- not to mention the performance of the commandments- were all infused with theurgic and magical potential, especially where the Hasidic tzaddiq or master was concerned. The tzaddiq became a virtual axis mundi whose efficacious practice helped to direct the flow of vitality and blessing through all the regions of creation for both mundane and cosmic subsistence, and it is difficult to conceive of Hasidism without the dynamic charismatic influence of this institution.23 Rabbi Shapira was heir to several different 21 For example Shapira, Hovat ha-Talmidim, 98-99, 171. Rabbi Shapira himself claims that this is one of the innovations of Hasidic approaches to Jewish mysticism. It is worthwhile to compare this with the view of a late-nineteenth-century Hasidic master, R. Gershon Henokh Leiner of Radzin, who also wrote a systematic introduction to Hasidism. According to R. Gershon Henokh, Hasidism transcended medieval philosophy as well as Kabbalah by translating the intellectual and doctrinal concerns of these movements back into the existential or phenomenological language of Jewish devotional practice, from which they had originally sprung. I am fundamentally sympathetic to the presentation of this argument by Shaul Magid, Hasidism on the Margin (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003) 72-108. 22 This principle is frequently associated by Jewish mystical writers with Ps 121:5: "The Lord is your shield [or shadow] at your right hand." Citing a midrash that makes use of this idea, R. Moses Cordovero gives evidence of its adoption by kabbalistic writers in the sixteenth century: "Just as your shadow, if you laugh at it, it laughs at you, and if you weep for it, it weeps along with you, and if you show it a face of outrage or of pleasure this is what it gives back, so the Holy One blessed be He is [like] your shadow. . . . Therefore, according to the actions that arouse the lower [i.e., the human being], so the upper [divine] will be aroused, for good or for ill" {Pardes Rimonim, Toledot Adam Sha'ar ha-Gadol 5). See Idel's discussion of a parallel passage in R. Meir Ibn Gabbai's Tola' at Yaaqov, 4a in Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988) 173-81, as well as 80-88 and 197-99. Idel argues that the Hasidic reworking of this concept focused more on divine emotions that on putative body parts, and returned to a less mechanistic and frankly theurgic view than that of the classical Kabbalah. "The theurgical element . . . was not rejected as in the ecstatic Kabbalah," Idel cautions, "but was transposed onto the spiritual-emotive plane" (ibid., 199). For Hasidic writers like Rabbi Shapira, this meant that the theme of broken-heartedness became relatively more important than the actual shedding of tears through ritual weeping. 23 See Arthur Green, "The Zaddik as Axis Mundi in Later Judaism." JAAR 45 (1977) 327-47 and Idel, Hasidism. "[T]he founders of Hasidism," writes Seth Brody, "are the heirs of what can only be described as a spirituality of cosmic blessing. The classical kabbalistic tradition presents mystical praxis as a process of entrance into the divine, in order to serve as a living conduit for the infusion of its creative energy into the cosmos."

The term partzufim, he notes, refers both to the endless variability of human faces and to the differing articulations of the divine anthropos in Jewish mysticism.25 Rabbi Shapira's own cosmology falls squarely within the mainstream of Polish Hasidic thought, but also betrays a strong conceptual influence from the Habad school.26 Afew primary terms dominate Rabbi Shapira's discussion of the emotions in Hasidic education. Hitragshut implies agitation or excitement and a degree of sensitivity to external stimuli. A whole section of his second volume on spiritual education, which is entitled "How to Become an Emotional Person ( Hsh mitragesh)? includes exercises designed to intentionalize and amplify the emotions that occur in daily life. "You will laugh and cry together," he promises his students at an early stage of their training, and he encourages them to let no emotion dissipate without first deploying it in their quest for spiritual development.27 A moment of sadness over some trivial event should be seized and transformed into sadness over the exile of God and the Jewish people; a moment of mundane loneliness should be turned towards God in prayer. By its nature, hitragshut allows for mixed motives and ambivalence, which is not at all the case with hitlahavut or "burning enthusiasm," a term that is frequently invoked in Hasidic literature to connote a state of single-mindedness in which "you cannot restrain or hold yourself back, since all of you is inflamed and your whole self, the flames of your soul, are alight with God's fire."28 If hitragshut applies to the emotions at almost any stage of training, hitlahavut is nearly always used to connote the attainment of higher devotional intensity through prayer. On the specific importance of the tzaddiq in Rabbi Shapira's teaching, see Schweid, From Ruin to Salvation. 24 See for instance Shapira, Derekh ha-Melekh, 79-83. Rabbi Shapira's father was the Hasidic leader R. Elimelekh of Grodzisk. Other ancestors include important early masters like R. Elimelekh of Lyzansk, the author of No' am Elimelekh (Lemberg, 1874) and R. Kalonymous Kalman Halevy Epstein of Krakow, the author of Ma'or va-Shemesh (Lemberg, 1890), for whom Rabbi Shapira was named. His father-in-law and cousin was the Rebbe of Koznitz, who took over young Kalonymos's education after the death of his father. 25 Shapira, Hovat ha-Talmidim, 217-18. 26 It is true that Rabbi Shapira's contemporary (and fellow Warsaw Ghetto inhabitant) Hillel Zeitlin rejects the influence of Habad on Rabbi Shapira's Hasidism, but this appears to be a stylistic impression based only on Rabbi Shapira's first published book, Hovat ha-Talmidim. References to Habad writers are fairly common in Rabbi Shapira's broader corpus, as are certain terminological and conceptual influences whose description would exceed the scope of this article. See Hillel Zeitlin, Sifran shel Yehidim (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook, 1979) 241-44. Some similarities with Habad teachings have already been noted by Polen, The Holy Fire, 17, 169. 27 Shapira, Hakhsharat ha-Avreikhim, 44b-46a. 28 Ibid., 14-15. See Wacks, "Emotion and Enthusiasm."</page><page sequence="9">DON SEEMAN 473 Another analytically significant term is hitpa 'alut, which is "the quality of being acted upon" or moved by an external force, much like the English term "affect," and like "affect," it can also be qualified by specific emotive terms such as "sadness" or "joy." Hitpa 'alut ha-ka 'as is therefore the affect or passion of anger, which can denote an ecstasy of anger in some contexts.29 But while Hasidic texts frequently invoke hitpa 'alut to describe mystical states of various kinds, its first and primary meaning refers simply to the experience of emotion or passion in the Aristotelian sense of "something that is done to the thing of which it is predicated."30 This is the sense in which the word was first coined in the thirteenth century by Samuel Ibn Tibbon for his Hebrew rendition of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, where it stood for the Arabic term infi'al According to Maimonides, emotion was a property of changing, corporeal bodies that could not logically be predicated of the Unmoved Mover. Biblical language that seems to attribute affect of one kind or another to God is therefore always strictly metaphorical, and the ideal of imitatio Dei that Maimonides propounds entails a path of rational balance and resistance to agitation.31 One acts as if angry when necessary, according to Maimonides, but strives to remain always untouched by anger.32 This ethos of restraint and equanimity is of course opposed in many ways to the emotional cosmology advocated by Rabbi Shapira and other Hasidic writers, but some important leaders, like Rabbi Dov Baer of Lubavitch (1773-1827), sought to reconcile the two by arguing that Maimonides' rejection of divine hitpa' alut must refer to the transcendent Infinite or 'Ein So/that precedes emanation but not to the immanent and emotion-laden divinity that fills the Jewish mystical universe.33 In 1 83 1 , Dov Baer's "Tract on Ecstasy" or Kuntres ha-Hitpa 'alut criticized Hasidim 29 The fact that hitpa 'alut can sometimes be translated as ecstasy means that its correct translation in particular contexts must be carefully specified. It sometimes implies a greater intensity of emotion than mere hitragshut, as in Rabbi Shapira's statement that while a student may be moved to hitragshut or agitation by the practice of specific divine commandments, a more intense experience of hitpa' alut-ecstasy is occasioned by study of "the Torah and the light of God" in its more potent, undifferentiated form. Shapira, Hovat ha-Talmidim, 21. 30 On Aristotelian pathos, see for instance Aristotle, De Anima (On the Soul), (trans. Hugh Lawson-Tancred; New York: Penguin, 1986) 117-18. Ibn Tibbon's explanation of the Hebrew neologism hitpa' alut as an Aristotelian concept appears in his glossary of foreign and unfamiliar words printed in most editions of his thirteenth century translation of Maimonides* Guide for the Perplexed. Also see the glossary in Shlomo Pines 's translation of Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963). 31 See Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed 1:54-55, at 123-29. 32 Maimonides, Hilkhot De'ot 2:3. 33 Rabbi Dov Baer Schneersohn, In Ma 'amreiAdmur ha-Emtsa 'i: Derushei Hatunah (2 vols.; New York: Kehot, 1988) 1 : 192. Rabbi Shapira may have been more comfortable with open dissension from Maimonides in part because, as Polen ("Divine Weeping," 262) notes, his great-great grandfather, Rabbi Israel Hapstein of Kozienice (d. 1814), once reportedly asserted that Maimonides* ruling on anthropomorphism caused "a great darkness" to overtake the Upper World, since "so many souls who had previously entered paradise were now banished on account of Maimonides* decision that they were heretics, only to be restored later through the intervention of Rabbi Abraham ben David** [i.e., Rabad of Posquieres, Maimonides* most persistent twelfth-century critic]. Rabbi Shapira specifically</page><page sequence="10">474 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW who sought ecstasy as an end in itself because their ultimate focus would remain the experiencing self rather than God.34 An early stage of authentic hitpa'alut, on the other hand, is what Dov Baer calls the "goodly thought," referring to the attentiveness and attachment that one develops for an object of contemplation, "like a person who has received good news about a business project in which he is personally concerned [so that] the whole power of his mind becomes engaged in an ecstasy [hitpa'alut] . . . known as 'attachment of thought.'"35 Attentiveness to "goodly thought" may develop into emotional longing at a later stage, before it finally gives way to selfless awareness of the divine presence. Rabbi Shapira's short work on contemplative practices, entitled "Disciples of the Goodly Thought," was clearly influenced by this formulation, although he emphasized the educational rather than theoretical implications of hitpa'alut and the rudimentary stages of practice appropriate to non-adepts or adepts-in-training. 36 Like the members of the Habad school whom he cites in this context, Rabbi Shapira preferred even negative forms of hitpa'alut such as anger and impatience (a "boiling disposition") over cold rationalism, because he believed that anger could be sublimated through training into spiritual longing and compassion, while cold affect signified that the soul was still deeply submerged or "hidden" by gross physicality.37 By arousing the emotions and training them to be subjects of intentional control and reflection, the soul itself might gradually be made transparent to human experience as a primary conduit for divine influx and self-knowledge. While the naive subject imagines that the body experiences stimuli (hitpa'alut ha-hushim) and feels emotion (hitpa'alut ha-regesh) in a direct and unmediated way, the adept comes to understand that hitpa'alut always connotes action upon the experiencing soul, which is sheathed within and enlivens the body, but which must be understood as an extension of divine vitality.38 Understanding this in an experiential and not merely theoretical way is central to the theme of attainable urges his followers to rely upon Rabad against Maimonides in the use of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic imagery in spiritual training (Shapira, Bnei Mahashavah Tovah, 25). 34 Kuntres ha-Hitpa'alut has been published in Rabbi Dov Beer Schneersohn, Ma'amrei Admur ha-Emtsa'i: Kuntresim (New York: Kehot, 1991) 37-196, and translated by Louis Jacobs, Tract on Ecstasy (London: Valentine, Mitchell, 1963). Hitpa'alut-ecstosy remains an important theme of Habad Hasidism and its offshoots. For another, more insidious use of this concept in twentieth- century Jewish mysticism, see Don Seeman, "Violence, Ethics and Divine Honor in Modern Jewish Thought," JAAR 73 (2005) 1015-48. 35 Schneersohn, Kuntresim, 82. 36 Shapira, Bnei Mahashavah Tovah. Schweid, From Ruin to Salvation, 113, goes so far as to argue that Rabbi Shapira's careful attention to the spiritual attainment of the masses who cannot undertake complex training but can at least be filled with desire for intimacy with the divine, is "the whole of the new Hasidic pedagogic and didactic model" he innovated. How this differs from earlier Hasidic models however, awaits careful attention. 37 See for example Shapira, Hakhsharat ha-Avreikhim, 9b-10a. 38 Schweid, From Destruction to Salvation, suggests without elaboration that Rabbi Shapira was influenced in this regard by Kantian theories of sense perception.</page><page sequence="11">DON SEEMAN 475 prophecy that runs like a scarlet thread through all of Rabbi Shapira's pre-war and Ghetto writings. Nervous Bodies, Prophetic Bodies Prophecy was by no means an unusual subject for East European Jewish thinkers. In 1 899, a young Hebrew writer named Mordecai Feierberg published a short, semi- autobiographical novel describing the turmoil of a young man named Nahman who struggled to prepare himself for prophecy through rigorous religious discipline.39 As the story unfolds, Nahman 's failure leads him to disillusionment and then despair at the continuing exile and persecution of the Jewish people. He becomes an advocate of Enlightenment accommodation with Western civilization and ultimately -when even that hope has collapsed under the pressure of anti-Semitic rejection- a mad prophet of Zionist rebirth among the "peoples of the East." The novel's title, Whither? captures some of the despair experienced by this generation of Eastern European Jewish writers, who had broken with traditional life-ways but found no secure home in the outside world.40 In many ways, Feierberg's protagonist represents the impetus- as well as the risk- behind Rabbi Shapira's educational project. Like Rabbi Shapira's ideal student, Nahman attempts to attain prophetic insight through ascetic disciplines that include the self-conscious development of his imaginative and emotional faculties. In one of the novel's central passages, Feierberg describes Nahman's decision to seek prophecy after he experiences an ecstatic but wrenching vision (Alan Mintz calls it a "reverie") of Jerusalem in ruins, and decides to intercede with God on his people's behalf.41 These visions are close to the imaginative exercises that Rabbi Shapira would later prescribe for new initiates.42 Unlike Nahman or the novelist, however, Rabbi Shapira continued to believe in the redemptive power of prophecy and its emotional prerequisites even after the speedy redemption for which he had hoped had been denied. Feierberg's novel is just one more piece of evidence in support of Eliezer Schweid's contention that prophecy was a key metaphor in Jewish religious and political thought during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.43 For mystics like Rabbi Shapira, prophecy was part of an integrated religious worldview replete with ritual and hermeneutic strategies for the confrontation with a difficult and increasingly dangerous modernity. Abraham Joshua Heschel, like Rabbi Shapira, was the scion of an important Hasidic family in Poland between the wars who devoted himself to this topic. Born in Warsaw in 1907, Heschel left Poland just a few months before Hitler's invasion, 39 M. Z. Feierberg, Wan? (Tel- Aviv: Kitvei M. Z.

He eventually became a leading figure at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, where his evocative writings on the phenomenology of religious experience arguably won him more admirers than disciples.44 The 1962 English adaptation of his pre-war German doctoral dissertation, The Prophets, bears close comparison with Rabbi Shapira's corpus, because in it he links the idea of biblical prophecy to the study and discipline of the emotions and to divine anthropopathism. "The characteristic of the prophets," Heschel writes, "is not foreknowledge of the future, but insight into the present pathos of God."45 The prophet is "homo sympathetikos" [sic] existing in a state in which "man is open to the presence and emotion of the transcendent Subject. He carries within himself the awareness of what is happening to God.*46 This is virtually the same "mystical psychology" identified by Scholem and others with the Hasidic revolution in Jewish mysticism, and it is entirely in keeping with Rabbi Shapira's outlook. Although ostensibly teaching the history of biblical religion, Heschel's Prophets must also be understood as an extension or restatement of the Hasidic emphasis on prophecy as a continuous core of Jewish religious experience.47 Rabbi Shapira treats prophecy in his pre-war writings as an ideal telos of Jewish spiritual practice as well as a pragmatic educational goal related to the Hasidic resistance against secularism. "We don't wish to turn you into a prophet," he tells his young readers in 1932, "or even into a master of the Holy Spirit- at least not all at once. But a prince who has been thrown into a disgusting dungeon must have become very corrupt indeed if he is not at least anxious over his fate and does not yearn for his previous condition."48 This theme grows increasingly explicit (and indeed urgent) in subsequent chapters. At one point, Rabbi Shapira argues that Hasidic enthusiasm and biblical prophecy lie on a single continuum of attempts to leverage hitpa'alut ecstasy into a revelation of the divine vitality at the heart of all things. In an appended essay for older students he writes, "An Israelite who purifies his body" through Hasidic discipline "cannot help but be aroused to higher thoughts and more exalted yearnings, to peer beyond his body's mask."49 44 On Heschel's phenomenology of religious experience, see Edward K. Kaplan, "Abraham Joshua Heschel,*' in Interpreters of Judaism in the Late Twentieth Century (ed. Steven Katz; New York: B'nai B'rith, 1993) 131-50; Lawrence Perlman, Abraham Joshua Heschel's Idea of Revelation (Atlanta: Georgia State University Press, 1989). 45 Abraham Joshua Heschel, The Prophets (2 vols.; San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1962) 1:11. 46 Ibid., 1.89. 47 Schweid, From Ruin to Salvation, 112-14, shows that Rabbi Shapira viewed Hasidism as the culmination of a graded historical process in which biblical prophets, later rabbis and kabbalistic sages each contributed to a unique phase of cosmic tiqqun or repair. These movements continue and complete one another rather than marking strong institutional breaks.

Just so, [divine] light and holi- ness . . . descend from the highest of worlds, and are contracted ... in accord with what the body, depending on its degree of purification, has the capacity to receive. . . . [This "light"] becomes clothed [i.e., takes form] as neshamah [vitality enabling thought] in the brain; as ruah [vitality enabling speech and emotion] in the heart; and as nefesh [vitality enabling animation] in the liver [i.e., blood]. Each vessel [organ] receives only the level of holiness that it is capable of receiving.51 The heart is thus a bodily seat of passions {ruah) that are themselves "drawn down from on high," making the body's condition crucial for the attainment of prophetic sympathy. Heschel likewise notes that the term ruah (literally "wind" or "breath") denotes emotion in biblical texts, and that the prophet Hosea is described as 9ish ha-ruah, or "man filled with divine pathos" for just this reason.52 Rabbi Shapira's innovation was to tie this emotional cosmology to a contemporary theory of nerves and nervousness that had not yet been invoked by his predecessors. Prophecy, for Rabbi Shapira, is dependant on both contingent and essential factors. While he considered discipline and training to be crucial, he also thought that Jews were inherently more susceptible to prophetic agitation, and he was the first to ground this distinction in a twentieth-century medical idiom of nervousness. He portrayed the nerves, 'atzabim in Hebrew (occasionally simply transliterating "nerves" into Hebrew characters), as the most ethereal of all corporeal organs and therefore the best suited to mediate body and spirit through an emotional medium. He was by all accounts well acquainted with contemporary medicine, which portrayed the nervous system as a fragile receptive network susceptible to impression (and potential overload) by external trauma.53 Indeed, Nehemia Polen recounts that Rabbi Shapira's friend Dr. Aaron Solowiejczyk, who was head of surgery at Warsaw's Jewish hospital, saw to it that the rabbi's prescriptions (based 50 See Byron Good and Mary- Jo Delvecchio Good, "The Comparative Study of Greco-Islamic Medicine: The Integration of Medicine into Local Symbolic Contexts." in Paths to Asian Medical Knowledge (ed.

Don-Yahiya's somewhat hagiographic work on Rabbi Shapira's brother, Admor Halutz (Tel- Aviv: Moreshet, 1961) 295.</page><page sequence="14">478 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW on autodidactic medical knowledge) were honored at local pharmacies --even though Hasidim sometimes preferred to keep his signature for its talismanic power rather than having their prescriptions filled. Rabbi Shapira was aware that some observers would cynically attribute his healing efficacy to the "power of suggestion" but remarked that he preferred the Hasidic idiom of "simple faith."54 In addition to sensory stimuli, he argued that human nerves were receptive to the diffuse presence of divinity or 'elohut that radiates through all things, vibrating with an emotional vitality that allows homo sympathetikos to emerge. Yet this framework, in which authoritative religious and medical discourses coalesce, also allowed nervous disorder to emerge for the first time as a properly religious dilemma requiring explanation. Like tuberculosis and other epoch-defining maladies, nervous overload carried ambivalent and sometimes contradictory meanings at the turn of the century. George Beard's 1881 treatise American Nervousness portrayed neurasthenia as a troublesome but necessary consequence of America's frantic industrial capitalism, a sign as well as a symptom of modernity's promise. In Europe as well as North America, nervous energy was often portrayed as a sign of feminine weakness that could also however be imbued with positive meaning as a mark of special moral and emotional sensitivity. It is not surprising that Jews were often portrayed as nervous and effeminate in the scientific and popular literature of the day.55 "Nothing is more conspicuous among them [the Jews]," wrote Victorian essayist William Lecky, "than their unhealthy coloring, their frail, bent and feeble bodies Their nervous organization is extremely sensitive, and . . . they are very liable to insanity and to other nervous and brain disorders."56 For Lecky, nervousness was related to Jews' effeminate hatred of violence and "peculiar horror from blood."57 Yet Rabbi Shapira inverted this charge by arguing that while Jews were in fact prone to nervousness, this was a result of their special readiness for prophetic agitation, which could only be controlled and shaped through ritual discipline. It was religious 54 Polen, The Holy Fire, 4. Healing was not uncommon among Hasidic masters in Eastern Europe, although we lack reliable accounts of the specific forms that this practice took.

"We can at least say," he writes, "that Israelites are by nature prone to nervousness . . . because they are the descendants of prophets." If they use this capacity for divine service, they can reach a very high level, and even attain the Holy Spirit [i.e., a weak form of prophecy]. If not, it is like the case of a person who is born with a powerful mind. When he does not use this intelligence, he risks madness. Thus it is that emotional excitement [hitragshuf]- which is a preparation for exalted service through self-annihilation, ecstasy and the Holy Spirit- can also be transformed into mischief and nervous agitation.59 The pre-war essays make only passing reference to psychologists (hakhmei ha-nefesh) and to physicians who attempt to "weaken [i.e., calm] the nerves" of those whose "thought has been damaged and impaired" through nervous exhaustion, but these references are crucial because they help to map the convergences in Rabbi Shapira's thought between medical and spiritual concerns focused on the emotional life.60 Techniques designed to quiet the mind through physical exercise and avoidance of mental agitation were important elements of contemporary thinking about nervous disorder, as they had been of nineteenth-century "rest therapies" applied to disorders of the moral will.61 Rabbi Shapira's innovation was to link these medical ideas with Hasidic ritual cosmology through meditative techniques designed to quiet and subdue the agitated mind into readiness for a prophetic influx.62 A short essay written by one of his students in 1 936 ("On Cultivating Inner 58 Shapira, Hovat ha-Talmidim, 93-94. 59 Ibid.

Rabbi Shapira's adoption of nervous disorder should be compared with the adoption of neurasthenia by Chinese doctors during the first half of the twentieth century, when it had already begun to decline as a diagnostic category among Western psychiatrists. Neurasthenia proved durable in China precisely because it was assimilated to traditional Chinese concepts of socio-somatic imbalance, just as Rabbi Shapira was drawn to nerve theory because it linked traditional Hasidic cosmology with authoritative medical discourse. See Arthur Kleinman, Social Origins of Disease and Distress: Depression, Neurasthenia and Pain in Modern China (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986); idem, The Illness Narratives (Boston: Basic Books, 1988). 61 See for instance Bruce Haley, The Healthy Body and Victorian Culture (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1978). 62 Shapira, Bnei Mahashavah Tovah, 14. Brill, Thinking God, 37 1 , contrasts Rabbi Shapira's approach usefully with that of earlier Polish Hasidim like R. Zadok ha-Cohen of Lublin (1823-1900) as well as Lithuanian Jews like R. Israel Salanter (1810-1883), who had begun to translate the traditional metaphysics of the soul into a descriptive psychological language without, however, basing this on contemporary medical theories drawn from the broader Gentile society. "This development was short-lived," writes Brill. "When modern Jewry accepted Western science, these Jewish psychologies</page><page sequence="16">480 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Quiet") describes his induction of select disciples into these methods, and attests to the urgency with which he viewed their propagation.63 Rabbi Shapira's dialectical concern with the necessity and danger of emotional agitation was thus framed from the outset by a distinctive junction of Hasidic cosmology and cosmopolitan medicine grounded in ritual practice. Emotion was conceived neither as a purely inner experience nor as a component of discursive meaning and shared personal significance, but was above all an efficacious presence or vitality endowed with real power to enliven the world, to link the divine and human realms- or better, to reveal their deep intrinsic unity. "Just as all of the other activities of the soul are revealed to us through actions of the bodily organs," writes Rabbi Shapira before the war, "so too it is with the emotions. It is the soul that is revealed by means of the body and its nerves "M This being the case, it should come as little surprise that his later response to crisis in the Warsaw Ghetto would not be limited to what Geertz has called "the problem of suffering"- the quest to make suffering meaningful- but extended also to the problem of efficacy, the "originary cry for help" (Levinas 1988), which precedes articulate meaning and may persist even when language and meaning have apparently failed.65 â–  "Useless Suffering" in the Warsaw Ghetto Rabbi Shapira9 s wartime essays, or derashot, were buried in the Ghetto before his murder and published several decades later by surviving Hasidim under the title 'Esh Kodesh ("Sacred Fire"). The first essay dates from the Jewish New Year of September 1939, shortly before the occupation of Warsaw, which was soon followed by a German order to segregate Jews into separate Ghettos, but over a year before nervous German public health officials ordered the Ghetto to be literally walled off against the outbreak of infectious disease that might compromise German troops.66 Even though the war had only just begun when Rabbi Shapira began writing, it is well to remember that some of his most devastating personal losses would be suffered during this period. His daughter-in-law and his sister-in-law (the latter had been visiting from Palestine) were killed outright during the initial German shelling, but his only son Elimelekh was mortally wounded on Yom Kippur and then lingered for a week without medical care until the festival of Tabernacles, or Sukkot, when he finally expired. Upon his death, Rabbi Shapira is said to have led came to an abrupt end." By the time Rabbi Shapira formulated his ideas on nervousness, according to this reading, modernization of Jews in Poland had reached the point where a truly compelling religious psychology was likely to borrow more freely from the idioms of contemporary medicine. While this is an intriguing and intuitively correct view, it will require further comparative study across a broad spectrum of Hasidic (and other) Jewish thinkers. 63 Shapira, Derekh ha-MelekK 406. 64 Shapira, Hakhsharat ha-Avreikhim, lOb-lla. 65 Levinas, "Useless Suffering." 66 Christopher Browning, The Path to Genocide: Essays on Launching the Final Solution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992) 145-68.</page><page sequence="17">DON SEEMAN 481 the holiday prayers with their usual exuberance, after admonishing the Hasidim that Jewish law permitted no public display of mourning during the festival. Already the dynamic of emotional control and its profound personal cost, which would characterize so many of his later Ghetto essays, was here in evidence. "This war has already defeated me," he was heard to remark; "we can only pray to God that the community of Israel outlasts the war."67 Early Ghetto sermons focused insistently on the problem of suffering that exceeds all normal or meaningful bounds, suffering that resists the sense of being "borne" or "suffered" because it overwhelms the ramified subjectivity that a stance of bearing presumes. In early November, a biblical text from Isaiah provided Rabbi Shapira with a framework for reflection upon the distinction between sufferers who were merely "exiled" but could, with effort, sustain a coherent subjectivity, and those who were "lost" because their power of self-recognition had already been shattered by radical suffering beyond repair: Even now, when troubles multiply to such an extent that the beards of Jews have simply been shaved off, leaving them unrecognizable on an external level, so too their interiority changes, leaving them unrecognizable from within. The person loses and cannot recognize himself (erfarlirt zikh). He cannot feel the way he did a year ago on the Sabbath or on a weekday before the prayers, or during prayer itself. Now, he is trampled and crushed, until he cannot even feel whether he is a Jew or a human being, or whether he is an animal. He has no reality left to feel. He is lost.68 The public humiliation of forced shaving points for Rabbi Shapira to a deeper and more terrible attack on the grounds of subjectivity and meaning-making that leaves the sufferer with "no reality left to feel." The sermon may conclude with a promise of ultimate divine rescue (God too, must perform the mitzvah of returning "lost objects" to their owners), but this hardly justifies identifying the essay with a stance of Hasidic optimism or unwavering faith. What truly stands out in these Ghetto writings is their unprecedented depiction of psychic collapse and the desperate struggle by their author to overcome his gathering silence and despair.69 Rabbi Shapira's depictions of collapse and near-collapse were unprecedented in the rabbinic literature of the time. What distinguishes the essays that comprise 'Esh Kodesh from most other essays by rabbinic authors that have been preserved was the extent to which their author was willing to engage the problem of meaninglessness and collapse as an irreducible core of Ghetto experience.

While it may be possible to abstract Hasidic ideologies or doctrines from Hasidic texts, writers like Rabbi Shapira sought explicitly to train the subjectivity of their readers for divine service, which in Rabbi Shapira's idiom meant training them for prophecy. These concerns, which before the war focused on the "enflaming" and sanctification of emotion as divine vitality, necessarily shifted in the Ghetto context to a concern with the management and sometimes damping of emotion for the preservation of humanity and cosmos alike.

"The greater his desire [for the redemption] was," writes Rabbi Shapira in this undated, pre-war sermon for Rosh Hashanah, "the more he falls and disintegrates, may God have mercy -as in 'my soul is sick with the love of you.' " Such a person is not wrong to be filled with love and desire, but grows ill from lack of strength to bear its weight- yet if he weeps with worry that perhaps God has cast him off, concludes Rabbi Shapira, this may paradoxically serve as a sign that God is drawing him close. 72 Ringelblum, Notes from the Warsaw Ghetto, 64 writes that "September 27, 1940, was the day on which, according to a nameless rabbi's prediction, 'something would happen and the Jews would be really and truly saved.' It was the date of the New Order Pact." When the redemption (reputed to involve Hitler's death) failed to come and was actually the occasion of increased persecution, "a man called Fridlajn committed suicide with his wife." 73 Piekarz, Ideological Trends, 378 asserts that 'Esh Kodesh is based on "ideas and fragments of ideas" drawn and paraphrased from earlier Jewish literature. He also asserts that Rabbi Shapira's biblical exegesis is "nothing more than an external framework meant to support his listeners, to strengthen their spirit and their power of resistance to the terrible decrees and especially to shape their faith in the God of Israel and his providence" (ibid., 377). Polen {The Holy Fire, xviii) responds with some justification that "Piekarz evidently reads 'Esh Kodesh as little more than a collection of unrelated homilies without a unifying center.

Two of the most important of these strategies, whose related yet incommensurate demands haunt Rabbi Shapira until the closing pages of his wartime corpus, might be called "suffering for the other" and "weeping in secret places." Suffering for the Other The Jewish liturgical calendar for the Sabbath of November 4, 1939 called for the public reading of the Torah portion that begins with Genesis 23, describing the death and burial of the matriarch Sarah in the city of Hebron. The biblical narrative offers no explanation for Sarah's death or for its juxtaposition with the "Binding of Isaac" in Genesis 22. Some ancient exegetes argued that Sarah's death follows upon Isaac's binding in order to teach that Sarah died from grief or shock when she learned that her husband had tried to slaughter their only son upon God's altar, and it is this midrash, rather than the biblical text itself, to which Rabbi Shapira turns after a brief prologue on the nature of suffering: The word "brit" [covenant] is juxtaposed in the Bible with both salt and with suffering.74 . . . Just as salt in proper measure preserves the meat, but in excess makes it impossible to enjoy, so suffering should come in proper measure, so that a person has the capacity to receive it. Suffering should be blended with mercy. 75 This teaching, which Rabbi Shapira attributes to his grandfather, R. Kalonymos Epstein of Krakow, implies that suffering itself can be described as a form of divine vitality that need not be viewed as inimical to human welfare so long as it is "blended" with mercy {rahamim) and experienced in "proper measure." 76 But having established a traditional Hasidic framework for thinking about suffering, Rabbi Shapira then veers into uncharted territory by arguing that Moses himself organized the biblical narrative to juxtapose Sarah's death with Isaac's "Binding" ('aqedah) precisely in order to call attention to the fact that Sarah had not been called upon by God to suffer "in proper measure," but far in excess of that limit: [That is why] Moses, our faithful shepherd, juxtaposed Sarah's death in the Torah with the Binding of Isaac. It was in order to exonerate us; to show what 74 b.

The kabbalistic-theurgic context of this teaching in Ma'or va-Shemesh is far more explicit than it is in 'Esh Kodesh, where technical kabbalistic terminology is often slipped into discussions that admit of more prosaic readings, perhaps because of Rabbi Shapira's conscious effort to write for initiates as well as beginners. Similar language of the dialectic between din (judgment) and rahamim (mercy) is also evident in some other wartime writings, but these typically assert the inherent metaphysical balance of the universe, rather than the experience of utter imbalance and excessive suffering emphasized by Rabbi Shapira.

And if this was true for Sarah, that great saint, who for all that was unable to withstand her harsh affliction, how much more so for us!77 Relaying the tale of Sarah's death through "too much suffering" is the Torah's strategy for exonerating future generations who would also one day face trials too terrible to withstand. This is a humane reading, which sides with human frailty in the face of divine power, and implicates Moses himself in teaching God a lesson, as it were, about human limitations.78 "Excess suffering" cannot be blamed on the sufferer, according to Rabbi Shapira, but God can be called to account for imposing it. Rabbi Shapira goes still further, insisting (with no obvious exegetical need) that Sarah exercised a paradoxical agency in her own demise, allowing herself to perish from grief so that her death would call attention to the erasure of agency on the part of those who would later be overwhelmed by suffering and grief: It is also possible to suggest that Sarah herself, in taking Isaac's binding so much to heart that her soul expired, did so for the good of Israel. In order to show God that an Israelite cannot be made to suffer beyond measure. And that even a person who remains alive after his affliction, through God's mercy, must still lose portions of his vitality, his mind and spirit. What difference does it make to me if I suffer a full or a partial death?79 Sarah is thus complicit in her own death because "she took the Binding of Isaac so much to heart" when she might instead have distanced herself from grief over her son for the sake of continued well-being. Rabbi Shapira portrays her as the mirror image of his own pre-war focus on the dangers of emotional quietude, since her destruction comes from a self-willed superabundance of empathy and emotional agitation. By allowing pain to defeat her rather than bracketing emotion, Sarah models a kind of agency whose strength is in vulnerability, in the practical knowledge of human fragility, and in recognizing the limits of meaning in suffering. This is an especially powerful example of "suffering for the other," because the matriarch in this reading allows shattering pain to defeat her as a lesson to God for the sake of other humans. Sarah's death must nevertheless be contrasted with the traditional Hasidic valorization of martyrdom accompanied by proper intention (kavvanah) and 77 Shapira, 'Esh KodesK 10. 78 Without mentioning Rabbi Shapira, Aviva Zornberg argues that a long interpretive tradition links the exploration of Sarah's death to themes of meaninglessness and frailty in the face of near- catastrophe by Jewish authors. See Aviva Gottlieb Zornberg "Cries and Whispers/* in Beginning Anew: A Woman 's Companion to the High Holy Days (ed. Gail Twersky Reimer and Judith A. Kates; New York: Touchstone, 1997) 174-200. A similar theme is raised by 'Esh Kodesh, 177, where Moses argues before God that the suffering of the Jewish people in Egypt will make it impossible for them to believe in his message. 79 Shapira, *Esh Kodesh, 10.

The traditional martyr is defeated only in body but not in spirit, imparting strength of conviction to others. In his pre-war writings, Rabbi Shapira himself encourages students to undertake a contemplative technique popularized by his famous ancestor R. Elimelekh of Lyzhansk, an early Hasidic leader who promoted the visualization of martyrdom described by earlier Jewish mystics as an adjunct to prayer.80 In passages from the pre-war writings, students are taught to visualize themselves carrying the wood, leaping onto the pyre and so-forth, for the sake of God's unity and oneness.81 Yet with only a few exceptions, this theme is minimized in the wartime essays.82 In October of 1940, Rabbi Shapira goes so far as to argue that contemporary Jews are being murdered completely outside the traditional martyrdom paradigm because they lack any redemptive "intent" of their own. This might seem to rob their deaths of religious significance, except that Rabbi Shapira finds even here a hint of sacrificial efficacy. It may be true, he writes, that the biblical patriarch Abraham's intention to sacrifice his only son to God was frustrated by divine intervention, but contemporary Jews complete the circle by giving their lives without any volition whatsoever- perfect ma'aseh (action) to consummate Abraham's perfect kavannah (intent). 83 To the extent that there is religious agency here, it is measured by the span of generations rather than individual lives, and in pure passivity. Sarah is available to Rabbi Shapira as an icon for Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto precisely because her death is not portrayed as a traditional martyr's death, with all of the implications of spiritual grandeur and powerful agency such a death would imply. Like many deaths that Rabbi Shapira must have witnessed in Warsaw, Sarah's death was unheroic and religiously unremarkable. She perished when suffering overwhelmed her defenses, yet she also allowed meaninglessness to engulf her for the sake of others who would one day fail to withstand their own challenges 80 On the contemplation of martyrdom among the sixteenth-century kabbalists in Safed, see R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, Joseph Caro: Lawyer and Mystic (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962) 151-54. This spiritual technique gained popularity among later Hasidim. See Michael Fishbane, "The Imagination of Death in Jewish Spirituality," in Death, Ecstasy and Other-Worldly Journeys (ed. John J. Collins and Michael Fishbane; Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995). It is important to remember, however, that martyrdom was a contested virtue even within the Hasidic fold, as described by Seeman, "Emotion, Martyrdom and the Work of Ritual," and Schindler, Hasidic Responses, 59-66. 81 Among many other passages on this theme written before the war, see Shapira, Hakhsharat ha-Avreikhim, 15b, 28b-30a and 68a-70b, the latter of which include a set of imaginative exercises to accompany the recitation of the Shema Yisrael prayer. 82 While Rabbi Akiva's martyrdom by Rome does constitute a frequent theme of Rabbi Shapira's wartime essays (see Polen, The Holy Fire, 67-69), these include few exhortations to emulate or to visualize Rabbi Akiva in the manner of the pre-war tracts. One exception is 'Esh Kodesh, 8-9, which dates to the Sabbath of September 16, 1939, in which Rabbi Shapira notes that correct spiritual preparation can free a martyr of death's agony, a theme to which he returned briefly toward the end of his Ghetto writings. 83 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 11-14. Piekarz, Ideological Trends, 396 argues that this teaching is unprecedented.

This does not mean that images of traditional martyrdom are absent from 'Esh Kodesh, as earlier studies have noted. But writers attuned primarily to the continuities between Rabbi Shapira's ceuvre and those of other traditionalist writers tend to overlook his subtle and sometimes radical innovations, including the frequency with which he points toward configurations of human experience that lack the signs of religious authentication or "meaningfulness" that other rabbinic authors of the period almost always seem to impose.84 Schweid has argued convincingly that Rabbi Shapira's phenomenological realism was an attempt to identify with his Hasidim in their difficulties, and perhaps also a strategy to stave off despair by objectifying his own pain.85 Yet I would add that there is also another, more organic basis to Rabbi Shapira's realism with regard to suffering, which is his longstanding concern for the depiction and training of affective states through which divine vitality flows.86 It cannot be insignificant that Rabbi Shapira's own mother Hannah Berakhah also died during the early days of the German occupation in October 1939, allegedly "of a broken heart" or "heart attack."87 Polen's citation of a Yiddish article published in the New York Forward in 1940 helps to emphasize the implicit contrast between the portrayal of Hannah Berakhah 's death and that of Rabbi Shapira's own apparent fortitude and self-control during this period: So the Piaseczner Rebbe lost, in the period of a few days, his only son, his mother, his daughter-in-law, and his sister-in-law. As there was no one else to say Kaddish for those who had died, the Rebbe is now reciting Kaddish for all of them. . . . The stricken Rebbe, however, is not broken in morale or 84 On some of the important mainstream rabbinic responses, see Gershon Greenberg, "Ontic Division and Religious Survival: Wartime Palestinian Orthodoxy and the Holocaust (Hurban)." Modern Judaism 14 (1994) 21-61; idem, "Elhanan Wasserman's Response to the Growing Catastrophe"; idem, "A Musar Response to the Holocaust." These responses included a pronounced messianism, alongside the argument that Jewish assimilation was to be blamed for arousing divine punishment and Gentile rejection, and that the terrible suffering being visited upon the Jewish people might serve to return them to the proper path. With respect to Rabbi Shapira, by contrast, Schweid {From Ruin to Salvation, 126-27) notes that "The bitter truth that became clear to him is therefore that sufferings do not generally bring a person to religious ascendance. On the contrary, beyond a certain level, they render [a person] insensitive." 85 Ibid, 105-7. 86 This is made explicit in the eighth chapter of Hakhsharat ha-Avreikhim, 37a-38b, where Rabbi Shapira instructs students in a technique of "expansive thought" through guided imaging during the early stages of prophetic training. Following earlier Talmudic and mystical practice, Rabbi Shapira urges the adept-in-training to meditate upon the day of death, but he goes further than most writers in providing a detailed example of what such a meditation might be like, replete with images of the illness and suffering that precede extinction. Themes which later resurface in the Ghetto writings include "pain which is so great that his thought cannot contain it, for he never knew that such difficult and bitter afflictions existed in the world, and he cannot bear them. After a difficult and bitter night such as this, he feels as if his afflictions have already smashed his body and disincorporated his limbs. Death and the grave consume the body and destroy it, and he comes to know that this destruction begins with his affliction while he still lives. . . ." 87 See Polen, The Holy Fire, 97.</page><page sequence="23">DON SEEMAN 487 spirit. He has remained in Warsaw, conducts tish [the ritual sharing of food] with his hasidim, learns Torah throughout the day, and is currently writing a book ['Esh Kodeshl]. The Piaseczner hasidim marvel at the remarkable self control of their Rebbe.88 It is difficult to know what sources this account may have drawn upon, yet the parallel between the news report and themes raised in fEsh Kodesh itself is remarkable. While the Forward praises Rabbi Shapira's heroic fortitude and productivity as a communal leader, there is good evidence from the wartime essays that Rabbi Shapira himself remained painfully torn between the model of suffering presented by Sarah and his own celebrated steadfastness, which required a certain emotional deadening toward his own suffering and that of others. In the essay on Sarah's death, for example, Rabbi Shapira obliquely raises but then quietly rejects the possibility that Sarah should be viewed as a kind of suicide because she "sinned against the remaining years of life allotted her" by failing to enact the psychic distancing that would have allowed her to survive. She did what she did for the sake of others, he writes, so she cannot be held blameworthy.89 In his final essay for the Jewish liturgical year that ended in late September 1941, by contrast, he describes the psychic deadening and collapse of self that paradoxically allowed sufferers like him to continue to function in the Warsaw Ghetto: 88 Ibid., 11-12. "77$/T literally means "table." Schindler, Hasidic Responses, 82, supposes that it was during his sharing of food at tish that Rabbi Shapira delivered the sermons that later were published as 'Esh Kodesh. He also describes the heroism of various Hasidic leaders who maintained the custom of tish even once it had been outlawed by the Nazis. Rabbi Eliezer Horowitz is said to have conducted tish with his Hasidim at the edge of the open grave into which they were soon to be shot. Rabbi Shapira discusses the meaning of the Hasidic "table" at some length in his pre- war sermon for the holiday of Simhat Torah 1930 {Derekh ha-Melekh, 284-86). "[SJomeone who transforms his body and his eating into [divine] service," writes Rabbi Shapira, "his table becomes for him like the priests eating [the sacrifices] . . . until the one who leads the tish and those who sit with him at his tish feel [margishim] a kind of trembling in holiness, since they feel love, fear, joy and connectedness all together at the table, "May the glory of God be forever, may God rejoice in His creations' [Ps 104:31]- not a [divine] service that is in the heavens alone, but a service that is with the world of [mundane] action." The Hasidic tish is thus an embodiment of many of the major themes of Rabbi Shapira's worldview and pre-war educational strategy. See Aharon Wertheim, Halakhot ve-Halikhot ba-Hasidut (Jerusalem: Mossad ha-Rav Kook, 1993) 165-69, and Joel Hecker, "Eating and the Ritualized Body in Medieval Jewish Mysticism," History of Religions 40 (2000) 125-52. 89 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 10. Suicide was not, of course, a purely metaphorical concern to rabbinic writers in Ghettos like Warsaw. Rabbi Efraim Oshry recounts that he was approached shortly before the liquidation of the Ghetto in Kovno in 1942 by a Jew who wanted to know whether it was permissible for him to commit suicide before deportation in order that he might be assured a Jewish burial, and also to avoid the worst of the torments that awaited the deportees. Rabbi Oshry responded by delineating the limited conditions under which he thought suicide would be permissible, even though he also felt that it would be irresponsible, under the circumstances, to publicize his decision. Rabbi Efraim Oshry, She'elot u-Teshuvot mi-Ma1 amakim (2 vols.; 2d ed.; New York: 1959) 1:42-50. Ringelblum, Notes from the Warsaw Ghetto, 113 writes however that "suicides before the war were seven a week, now they're three or four."</page><page sequence="24">488 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW We can now see that we do not feel [margishim90] the pain of each affliction that conies upon us with the same intensity that we used to feel even minor troubles. Moreover, we know that if we were to feel today the full pain of each affliction that comes upon us with the same bitterness and emotion [hargashah] that once we felt, it would be impossible, God forbid, to continue to exist for even one day. The simple reason for this is that, as our sages have taught, *The dead flesh of a living person does not feel the scalpel." All that we feel is a crushing sensation throughout our bones; the world is turned dark for us, neither day nor night, just disorientation and confusion, as if the whole world were pressing down upon us and crushing and compressing us, God forbid, until we burst. But we do not feel each individual torment.91 This is one of several essays in which Rabbi Shapira's measured hermeneutic gives way to a tone of desperate personal exclamation. Although he continues to believe in and to preach the inevitability of ultimate redemption, he acknowledges darkly that there are some for whom the salvation will certainly come too late, not because they have already been killed but because tragedy has ensured that "no person [i.e., experiencing subject] even remains to rejoice or to have his faith strengthened."92 On November 22, 1941 , after his recovery from what might have been typhoid, Rabbi Shapira grows even more explicit about the terrifying moral cost associated with his own survival: Even the person that God saves and revives from his troubles or heals from his illness lacks the heart to rejoice in his salvation. For although he is a Jew- and should he not rejoice that a Jew has been saved from death?- Still, he dares not be glad. In his heart, he thinks, "If I rejoice in the fact that I have been revived, am I not in the category [of one who says] "I am, and there is none but me?"93 As if I did not take to heart the whole catastrophe of Israel, and the masses of men, women and children who still had many years of life ahead but now fill graves of earth, as though they had descended alive to the abyss?"94 "There are times," Rabbi Shapira writes in one of his last Ghetto essays, in March of 1942, "when [a person] beats his heart, wondering, 'Is it other than the hardness of my heart within me that allows me to strengthen myself and to continue [sacred] study in the midst of my afflictions and the many afflictions of Israel?'"95 Polen glosses this painful question "survivor guilt," but there are also 90 From the word regesh used in the pre-war essays as a technical term for the lower reaches of emotional agitation. 91 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 117.

"Do not weep only for the one who kills himself," he wrote at the time, "but weep also for the walking dead" whose "very self and essence have grown cold."99 The fear of what one anthropologist calls the "loss of the human" takes many forms in Rabbi Shapira's oeuvre, from shattering overflow to deadening loss of all empathy for oneself and others, rendering death -even by suicide- far from the most terrifying eventuality.100 Despite these persistent indications of wrenching ambivalence, Rabbi Shapira struggled throughout the Ghetto years to preserve a degree of pathos and empathy commensurate with prophetic experience. In his sermon for 21 September 1940, he invokes the figure of a person who "rejoiced and caused others to rejoice with him" despite crushing sadness, and this becomes a kind of a model for his own wartime leadership. The "self-overcoming" [hitgabrut] he describes is certainly important in psychological terms as a means for overcoming despair, yet I am hesitant to join Henry Abramson in arguing that these Ghetto essays present a "therapeutic model" for extreme trauma, because of the way in which therapeutic language tends to medicalize Rabbi Shapira's profound moral and cosmological concerns.101 He sought a multivalent ritual efficacy that cannot be subsumed under the individualistic rubric of psychological constructs.102 Medical language tends, 96 Polen, The Holy Fire, 58-59. 97 On the shattering of vessels as a depiction of radical suffering see Shapira, yEsh Kodesh, 124. Piekarz, Ideological Trends, 397 points out that earlier mystical writers also applied the "shattering of the vessels" idiom to different catastrophes, including the slaughter of Torah scholars during persecution by Rome. 98 The expression is borrowed from Arthur Kleinman, "Everything that Really Matters: Social Suffering, Subjectivity and the Remaking of Human Experience in a Disordering World," HTR 90 (1997)275-301. 99 Shapira, Tzav ve-Zeruz, 16-17.

Whenever Rabbi Shapira describes the importance of psychic "strengthening" or "self-overcoming" in his Ghetto writings, in fact, he also insists that these practices act theurgically to transform divine "judgment" [din] into mercy [rahamim]. "This strengthening itself acts to transform evil into good, and bring blessing upon Your [i.e. God's] people Israel."103 In the language of Lurianic Kabbalah, this is another way of saying that self-overcoming [hitgabrut] helps to modulate and reduce the flow of vitality in suffering, and so avoid a "shattering of the vessels," which appears to be a literal rather than merely metaphoric concern. Even careful scholars like Nehemia Polen, Eliezer Schweid and Mendl Pierkarz, each of whom note the presence of these themes in 'Esh Kodesh, tend to underestimate their overall significance- perhaps because of their preoccupation with the extraction of propositional meanings of a theological or discursive nature, and perhaps also because most historical and theological writers are ill accustomed to thinking about ritual in theoretical terms.104 By contrast, I am arguing that these texts should be read as the literary pole of an embodied practice aimed at shifting the entire habitus of divine and human relationships. Making suffering "sufferable" through symbolic or theological articulation was at best only secondary to this goal, and was sometimes frankly discarded as impossible. In a diary entry from February 1941 , the Ghetto historian Emmanuel Ringelblum describes Hasidim dancing in the Warsaw Ghetto: In the prayer house of the Pietists from Braclaw on Nowolipie Street there is a large sign: Jews, Never Despair! The Pietists dance there with the same religious fervor as they did before the war. After prayers one day, a Jew danced there whose daughter had died the day before.105 For a secularist like Ringelblum, this scene evokes many attempts by Ghetto inhabitants to maintain an air of normalcy despite their situation, yet it is worth noting that the "pietists [Hasidim] from Braclaw" (Breslov) to whom he refers are 103 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 62. 104 Piekarz, Ideological Trends, 392, 403-4 describes at least two examples of the "sweetening of judgments'* theme in 'Esh Kodesh, yet he repeatedly summarizes Rabbi Shapira's goal in these passages as "explaining the meaning and significance [of divine justice]" or understanding "the meaning of the tribulations/* as if these depictions of ritual activism on Rabbi Shapira's part were really just idioms for an essentially cognitive concern. Schweid does a somewhat better job of emphasizing the ritual and theurgic components of Rabbi Shapira's Ghetto writings, noting for instance that he sought to "activate every one of Hasidism's educational-mystical-ritual tools of leadership within the context of the Nazi conquest" {From Ruin to Salvation, 106). Yet Schweid too retreats from this position by asserting repeatedly that Rabbi Shapira's fundamental motivation was the (failed) attempt to find "theological justifications for the Holocaust while it occurred" (ibid., 138). Schweid shows relatively minor attention to Rabbi Shapira's specific claims about the efficacy of ritual, which he too seems to treat as a homiletic device designed to raise the spirits of the Hasidim. 105 Ringelblum, Notes from the Warsaw Ghetto, 125, dated 19 February 1941.</page><page sequence="27">DON SEEMAN 491 known precisely for the redemptive significance they attribute to joyous dance as a ritual technique for integrating the human body and personality with the divine anthropos, thus drawing blessing down into the phenomenal world.106 Rather than an attempt to distract themselves from their situation, therefore, might this not be understood as an attempt to ritually engage and overcome it? In June 1940, by the same token, Rabbi Shapira's celebration of the Jewish Shavuot [Pentecost] festival was described by a witness, Rabbi Shimon Huberband: There was a crowd of about 150 people, but the traditional dairy meal wasn't served as it was in earlier years. The Rebbe said words of Torah, including many words of strengthening and encouragement. Various zmiros [traditional melodies] were sung. When the gathering concluded, the traditional dance- with one person standing behind the other- began. During the dance, the Rebbe wept profusely.107 106 Michael Fishbane, "To Jump for Joy: The Rites of Dance According to Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 6 (1997) 371-87. Schindler, Hasidic Responses, 84 cites a Lodz Ghetto testimony by Simha Bornstein, a Hasid who wrote to his brother that Rabbi Nahman had come to him in a dream and danced with him, and that he found upon awakening a passage in the Rabbi's book testifying that "he believes that dancing softens Dm" [divine judgment]. 107 Cited in Polen, The Holy Fire, 13. It has not to my knowledge been noted in this context that ritually efficacious or mystical weeping has been associated specifically with the night of the Shavuot festival. Already in the sixteenth century, Rabbi Shlomo Alkabets writes that a group who gathered at Rabbi Joseph Karo's house in Turkey on Shavuot heard revelations from Karo's angelic maggid that included a special order of study and prayer for the night {tiqqun Shavuot), as well as strong encouragement to ease the exile of the Divine Presence by emigrating to the Holy Land (which both Alkabets and Caro soon did). "All of us burst into weeping from joy/' writes Alkabets, "and also when we heard about the suffering of the Shekhinah [Divine Presence] because of our sins, her voice [i.e., that of the Shekhinah] like that of an ill woman pleading with us, and so we strengthened ourselves and did not pause in our study until morning." It is noteworthy that this experience led to certain ritual innovations related to the intensification of mourning practices for the destruction of Jerusalem and the Shekhinah *s exile. See R. Isaiah Horowitz, Shnei Luhot ha-Brit, Masekhet Shavuot: Perek Ner Mitzvah 6-1 3. It is clear that this practice bore strong affinities with the custom of midnight study and lamentation {tiqqun hatzot) which also were subjects of innovation by the Safed mystics at around this time. On the efficacy of Torah study joined to lamentation for the pursuit of mystical visions as well and hastening redemption, see Eitan Fishbane, "Tears of Disclosure: The Role of Weeping in Zoharic Narrative," The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 1 1 (2002) 25-47; Moshe Idel, Messianic Mystics (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998) 308-320; Shaul Magid, "Conjugal Union, Mourning and Talmud Torah in R.

Idel interprets an account of R. Israel of Ryzhin (1796-1850) weeping with his students after the evening meal one Shavuot rather than teaching them Torah as a statement about the decline of the generations in Hasidism (Idel, Hasidism, 239-44), but this episode too is rendered more coherent if we posit that both R. Israel and Rabbi Shapira were participating in a</page><page sequence="28">492 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Rabbi Shapiro's dance may have been less exuberant than the dancing that Ringelblum describes, but neither his dancing nor his tears were any less spiritually ramified. In a 1928 letter to his son who was living in the land of Israel, and who had complained in a prt-Shavuot letter to his father of a certain spiritual dullness, Rabbi Shapira writes: A person prepares himself before the festival for the festival, and on the festival itself he penetrates according to his level the clouds ['arafel] and draws down a little bit of the honey, and then when his joy breaks forth and he dances, his soul is revealed through this emotion [hitragshut]; but when a person is covered by dust all year long and he also dances on the festival, who can assure me that this is anything more than just a trembling of the nerves ['atzabim]! m In a lengthy passage from his pre-war journal dated 1 933 furthermore, Rabbi Shapira reflects upon his emotions [hitragshuyot] during the holiday dancing of previous years, which was also often accompanied by weeping and by the expectation of a divine response: "Lord of the Universe who hears the voice of weeping," he writes, "what will you do with all the tears that Israel has shed during these days of grace [i.e., the festivals]? . . . And what will You do with Your own tears that fall, as it were, each day, on account of our catastrophe and our affliction?"109 The redemptive efficacy of such tears is construed as neither wholly mechanical ritualized practice long associated with this holiday. Wertheim, Halakhot ve-Halikhot, 156, notes that many Hasidic leaders were willing to forgo the teaching of Torah at their tish because the communal sharing of food and song were considered equally efficacious with Torah study. He also cites R. Shalom of Belz, whose work on the reasons for Hasidic customs {Ta'amei ha-Minhagim, 3:82) asserts the mystical equivalence of tish (the mystical sharing of food) and tiqqun Shavuot, the program of nighttime study on this holiday. 108 From a letter dated "Fourth day of Parashat Shelah" of the Jewish year 5688 (1938). See Iggerot Kodesh, p. 4, printed in Zikhron Kodesh le-va 'al 'Esh Kodesh. On dance and redemptive consciousness in the thought of Rabbi Shapira's ancestor, R. Kalonymos Epstein of Krakow, see Nehemia Polen, "Miriam's Dance: Radical Egalitarianism in Hasidic Thought/1 Modern Judaism 12(1992)1-21. 109 Shapira, Tzav ve-Zeruz, 22. Here we see that human and divine weeping are both described as potentially redemptive in a pre-war text. R. Shapira's grandfather, R. Epstein of Krakow, notes in Ma' or va-Shemesh (on the Haftarah for Mahar Hodesh) that a person who weeps for the exile of the Divine Presence can perform "great unifications" by raising the lowest sefirah {Malkhut) into contact with the "highest" places from which blessing is channeled. R. Shapira's close contemporary, R. Samuel Borenstein of Sochachew also writes (in his 1917 essays on Vayigash and Shelah in Shew, mi'Shemuel) that the strong redemptive power of tears shed in prayer derives from the fact that tears originate in the "brain" (i.e., corresponding to the highest rungs of sefirotic emanation), and that this renders them "pure waters that wash away all filth." Moshe Idel {Kabbalah, 75) refers to mystical weeping as a ritual practice "that can be traced back through all the major stages of Jewish mysticism over a period of more than two millennia," but focuses his own important discussion {Kabbalah, 74-88, 197-99) on the theosophical Kabbalah of Vital and his contemporaries. On the redemptive power of divine weeping, see Michael Fishbane, "The Holy One Sits and Roars: Mythopoesis and Midrashic Imagination," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 1(1991)1 -21; Aryeh Wineman, "The Metamorphosis of Narrative Traditions: Two Stories from Sixteenth Century Safed," AJS Review 10 (1985) 165-80; Polen, "Divine Weeping," and "Sealing the Book with Tears."</page><page sequence="29">DON SEEMAN 493 nor purely metaphoric in nature, as the well-documented tradition of mystical weeping among pious Jews (and indeed, their Christian and Muslim counterparts) attests.110 Ritual practice is doubly efficacious in this setting, in that it promises a divine response as well as forming a ground for the cultivation of embodied virtues like the dispositions through which emotional experience- glossed by words like hitragshut and hitpa 'alut- is managed. It is true that Hasidic texts like 'Esh Kodesh frequently attempt to join the disciplinary and discursive poles of ritual through reflection and exegesis on the sources of religious practice, but this should not lead scholars to conclude that ritual is primarily a symbolic code awaiting "interpretation" in a theological or cultural vein, much less an attempt to solve the puzzle of "meaning" in some abstract way.111 On their own terms, the Ghetto writings strive to strike an appropriate balance between the necessity and danger of emotional experience, which is always framed as both a psychic and a cosmic dilemma.112 Nor is it surprising that Rabbi Shapira engages this problem through the study and teaching of Torah, which is already a privileged site of ritual efficacy in Jewish mysticism.113 The writer, the teacher, and the student do not merely describe the empathy of prophetic selfhood, as Rabbi Shapira explains already in his earliest pedagogical tract, but rather participate in such empathy to the degree that their training and 110 The extent to which mystical or theurgic practices like weeping are thought to have a nearly automatic or mechanical efficacy varies. Idel {Kabbalah, 198) shows that even a single writer like R. Hayyim Vital made contradictory statements on the subject in different contexts. Idel suggests, however, that Hasidism in general moved away from mechanistic conceptions toward a more profound reliance on emotional experience and anthropopathic correspondence. Rabbi Shapira pauses on several occasions to remind his readers that the efficacy of Jewish mystical study and practice depend entirely on the attainment of a transformed subjectivity which bespeaks authentic "revelations of the soul" that can later be attested through their long-term ethical and spiritual effects upon of the individual (see Hovatha-Talmidim, 159-79). The problem of mechanistic performance vs. "spontaneity" (which relates in theoretical terms to a broader set of issues about the nature of agency in ritual practice) has been raised for ritual weeping in Christian and Muslim contexts respectively by Piroska Nagy, "Religious Weeping as Ritual in the Medieval West," in (ed. Don Handelman and Galina Lindquist; New York: Bergahn, 2005) 119-37, and Saba Mahmood, "Rehearsed Spontaneity and the Conventionality of Ritual: Disciplines of Salat," American Ethnologist 28 (2001) 827-53. 1 ' ' The idea that ritual symbols should be viewed as part of a shifting continuum between discursive and disciplinary poles builds on a distinction between discursive and "sensory," or viscerally embodied symbols in Victor Turner, The Forest of Symbols (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1967). See also Seeman, "Martyrdom, Emotion and the Work of Ritual." 112 My approach to 'Esh Kodesh has been influenced by ethnographies like Unni Wikan, Managing Turbulent Hearts (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990). Wikan challenges cultural anthropologists who study emotion to adopt a more experience-near perspective by asking what is at stake for people in the construction and management of their emotional lives.

Weeping in Secret Places Meeting the divine within the text became more pronounced in Rabbi Shapira's corpus as the war progressed. While early sermons like the one about Sarah's death emphasized the source of suffering in divine agency, some of his later sermons shift their emphasis towards the perception of suffering as an unfathomable divine burden.115 In a sermon from 14 February 1942, just a few months before the last of the surviving Ghetto sermons, Rabbi Shapira delivers what is perhaps his most searing and emotionally intense sermon on this theme: Sometimes when a Jew is afflicted with suffering, he thinks that only he is in pain, as if all of his personal torment and the torment of the community of Israel do not touch [i.e., have no effect] above, God forbid. But the verse tells us, "In all of their pain, He is pained."116 And in the Talmud it appears that "when a person is in pain, what does the Shekhinah [i.e., divine presence] say? 'My head is too heavy for Me; my arms are too heavy for Me.'"117 In the sacred books it is written that much more than the person is pained, God is pained, as it were, by the afflictions that a Jew suffers.118 In a note appended to one of his earlier essays, Rabbi Shapira had argued that "the strange afflictions and terrible, bizarre forms of death that the bizarre and wicked murderers have innovated for us since autumn 5692 [1941]" were without precedent in Jewish history.119 This comment may well relate to the adoption on his own part about the relationship between Ghetto suffering and earlier precedents from Jewish history, may well relate to the adoption of an unambiguous policy of genocide throughout occupied Poland around this time.120 Be that as it may, Rabbi Shapira's early preoccupation with the dynamics of human loss and resilience give way in several key essays from this period to the contemplation of God's own inner life. Building on classical rabbinic and mystical precedents, Rabbi Shapira speaks to the experience of deep abandonment that must have haunted his listeners. 114 See for instance Hovat ha-Talmidim^ 149-79. Moshe Idel marshals earlier sources to this effect in his "White Letters: From R. Levi Isaac of Berditchev's Views to Postmodern Hermeneutics," Modern Judaism 26 (2006) 169-92. 115 Polen, The Holy Fire, 106-121. 116 Isa 63:9, based on a variant reading preserved alongside the Masoretic text.

It isn't just that a person could never bear such great suffering as God bears, but that a person could never conceive properly of God's pain- never know His suffering or hear His voice: "Woe is to Me that I have destroyed My house and exiled My children!"121 Only the finitude of human psychic "vessels" prevents sufferers from perceiving that God's unutterable pain is in reality linked to their own. The Talmudic passage to which the sermon alludes tells the story of a certain Rabbi Yose, who once sought shelter amidst the ruins of Jerusalem in order to pray. He heard a voice "cooing like a dove" and saying, "Woe is to Me, that I have destroyed My house and exiled My children!"122 Later, Elijah the prophet tells Rabbi Yose in a vision that the voice he had heard was God's voice, and that it can be heard lamenting in this way every day, whenever pious Israelites gather in their synagogues to pray. Why then, asks Rabbi Shapira in his sermon, had Rabbi Yose never heard the voice of God before? His startling answer is that it was only when Rabbi Yose prayed in the ruins of destroyed Jerusalem that his own subjectivity could be "sufficiently annihilated, his own principle of constriction and boundary sufficiently destroyed" to allow the voice of God to break through. God may "roar like a lion," as Scripture indicates, but Rabbi Yose could hear nothing but an echo of that voice "cooing like a dove" when he stopped to pray amidst the destruction. Just as a ruin may be the only house of prayer that truly opens itself to the heavens, so homo sympathetikos may encounter God's grief only in the expansive ruins of his own shattered persona. This teaching transposes Rabbi Shapira's own ambivalence about emotional self-mastery onto God's ambivalence about restraining a grief whose expression the cosmos would not bear. "This also explains how the world continues to exist in its place," Rabbi Shapira continues, "and is not destroyed by the grief and the voice of the Holy One blessed be He on account of the people of God who are suffering and His house [i.e., the Temple at Jerusalem] which has been razed. It is only because His great grief cannot enter the world."123 Yet this response, which 121 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 159. 122 b. Ber. 3a. 123 Shapira, yEsh Kodesh, 1 60. My reading of this text as a transposition of Rabbi Shapira's own emotional ambivalence is supported by the fact that he cites many of the same proof-texts about divine weeping in his pre-war writings to describe human, rather than divine emotion. See for instance the essays on Sarah's death from 1931 and 1933 in Derekh ha-Melekh, 13-21. Rabbi Shapira is far from the first to use these texts about divine pathos in a discussion of human grief and emotional experience. To take just one example, Rabbi Samuel Borenstein of Sochachew invoked these themes in 1917 for a critical comparison of those Hasidic teachers who rely on heavy emotionalism and</page><page sequence="32">496 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW is based on a profoundly spatial metaphor of God's "great grief," is by itself indecisive because it begs the question of God's willingness to communicate divine grief in a frame that human beings could understand if God wanted them to. On the contrary, divine agency and silence were acute problems for Ghetto inhabitants, requiring sophisticated treatment. m Rabbi Shapira invokes a rabbinic motif in which the angels argue with God over the creation and sustenance of sinful humanity. This is a formulation that evokes deep and perhaps unprecedented pathos in Rabbi Shapira's teaching because of his characteristic insistence that the angels of the Midrash really represent nothing but competing impulses- which is to say ambivalence- within the divine persona.125 An angel is pictured by a Midrash on the book of Lamentations arguing with God over the propriety of God's weeping in public.126 It is disgraceful, states the angel, for a king to admit being aggrieved by his subjects, and so he offers to weep in God's stead, so that God will have not have any more reason to weep. What this really means for Rabbi Shapira is that since the angel represents that aspect of divine intentionality that demands an immediate redress of human wrongdoing, the angel's weeping would wipe God's cosmos violently and decisively clean through a variation on the redemptive (but also destructive) power of tears: If the voice of God's weeping were once to be heard in the world, the world would hear it and explode. Even a spark of God's grief in the world would scorch all of his adversaries. At the Red Sea, the Holy One blessed be He exclaimed [to the ministering angels], "My handiwork [the Egyptians] are drowning in the sea, and yet you sing praises before me?" And now that it is the Israelites who are drowning in blood, can the world continue to exist?â„¢ those (like Rabbi Borenstein and his grandfather, R. Menahem Mendl of Kock), who take a more intellectually and emotionally restrained approach. See his Shem mi-Shemuel, Vayigash 1917, as well as Seeman, "Martyrdom, Emotion and the Work of Ritual." 124 In cultural terms, silence was often framed as the rupture or withdrawal from relationship among Jews and Jewish writers in Eastern Europe, and this was also sometimes transposed to the relationship between God and the Jewish people. Yet certain forms of divine silence could even be framed as redemptive in nature, through the suppression of catastrophic emotion, as in 'Esh Kodesh, or through the gathering of forces before decisive action to change the course of human history -as in the comment by an earlier Hasidic writer that God is like a powerful man, who absorbs insult after insult in silence before sweeping away His adversaries with an unstoppable rage (R. Gershon Hanokh Henikh [1839-1891], citing his grandfather, R. Mordecai Yosef Leiner of Izbica, in Sod Yesharim: Purim va-Pesah [Warsaw: 1901; repr., Brooklyn: 1992] 30, 80). For more on the themes of silence and redemption, and the gendered expectations relating to silence and speech, see Don Seeman, "The Silence of Rayna Batya: Torah, Suffering and Rabbi Barukh Epstein's 'Wisdom of Women,'" Torah U-Madda Journal 6 (1995-1996) 91-128. 125 In *Esh Kodesh, 160, Rabbi Shapira refers explicitly to the angels as "agents of blessed God through whom His actions are carried out," where the intent is to suggest that they do not have will or agency of their own. 126 From the twenty-fourth proem to Lamentations Kabbah. 127 Ibid. [Emphasis in the original.]</page><page sequence="33">DON SEEMAN 497 For a moment, Rabbi Shapira allows the torrent of his own grief to burst the carefully woven exegetical strata of his discourse, as he openly identifies with the angels' demand for immediate divine intervention at the price of cosmic catastrophe. The desire for a cathartic expression of divine grief that would purge the world of human evil ("can the world continue to exist?") seems almost overwhelming for Rabbi Shapira, yet Rabbi Shapiro's God still chooses a path of infinite silence and self-restraint rather than assent to the angel's request. Refusing to weep in public allows the cosmos to be preserved, but must inevitably be perceived as lack of care and empathy by those who suffer. Angels consistently represent the demand for absolute justice and truth in Rabbi Shapiro's reading of rabbinic literature, yet God stands for the sustainability of human presence. "Since God sought to atone for Israel's sins, and the time for salvation had not yet come. ... He answered [the angel] saying, 4I will enter a place where you do not have permission to enter, and there [alone] I will weep."128 Underlying all of this is a reference to yet another Talmudic text in which the secret place of God's weeping (from the verse, "My soul shall weep in secret places") is identified with battei gavei or "inner chambers." 129 These in turn are identified by commentators with the highest of the sefirot in which differentiated being can be said to begin taking shape, namely binah.130 Earlier commentators tended to read this Talmudic discussion in an essentially abstract and technical way that neutralized any hint of divine pathos, but Rabbi Shapira characteristically strives 128 Ibid. 129 Jer 13:17, cited in b. Hag. 5b. "But if you will not hear it, My soul shall weep in secret places for the pride. Rabbi Samuel bar Inia said in the name of Rav, The Holy One blessed be He has a place and its name is * Secret.* . . . But is there any weeping before the Holy One blessed be He? For behold, Rav Papa said, There is no grief before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written, Honor and majesty are before him, strength and beauty are in His sanctuary [Ps 96:6] ! There is no contradiction: in one case we refer to the inner chambers [battei gavei], in the other, to the outer chambers [battei barei]." 130 In the sixteenth century, both R. Samuel Edels (Hiddushei Aggadot Maharsha, ad loc.) and Rabbi Moses Cordovero, Pardes Rimonim 8:12 identified the hidden battei gavai where God weeps with the sefirah of binah. Also see Rabbi Bahya ben Asher's fourteenth-century Torah commentary on Gen 6:6 and R. Menahem Azaria of Fano (Pelah ha-Rimmon, ch. 8). Nehemia Polen {The Holy Fire, 141-42) notes that some kabbalists preferred to identify the divine pathos with a lower order of the sefirotic structure, presumably to avoid imputing tumultuous emotion to divinity, but it seems unwarranted to refer to this preference as a "consensus," since several Hasidic writers did in fact follow the opinion of Cordovero and Edels. Rabbi Shapira explicitly cites R. Edels as the source of his own teaching, although it appears that he was influenced by the formulation of Pardes Rimonim as well. Medieval opposition to the identification of "inner chambers" with divine weeping includes R. Todros ben Joseph ha-Levy Abulafia (Otzar ha-Kavod), R. Meir Ibn Gabbai (Avodat ha-Kodesh), R. Shimon Lavi (Ketem Paz) and R. David Ibn Zimra {Magen David), all of whom are cited in R. Reuven Margoliot's Nitzotzei Zohar to Zohar III: 15b. Also see R. Menahem Recanati's commentary on Gen 6:6 with the supercommentary of Rabbi Mordecai Jaffee, Levush Even Yekarah in Levushei 'Or Yakrut (Jerusalem: Zikhron Aharon, 2000), 62-63. It is worth noting that this dispute may depend in part on a variant reading of the Talmud cited by R. Hananel ben Hushiel, ad loc., which seems to mediate against R. Cordovero 's reading. Zohar 1:65 can be read to support either position.</page><page sequence="34">498 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW in this sermon to convey an experience of the unplumbed divine anguish that has been hidden away for the world's sake.131 "Now God's pain," he writes, "which is too much for the world to contain, becomes even greater and more sublime, so that not even the angel can perceive it."132 Sarah may have died by taking suffering "too much to heart," in other words, but God reconciles infinite pain with the life of the cosmos by occulting grief in the most secret of cosmic or psychic recesses, where it cannot cause harm. This message may well have been intended to console sufferers in Warsaw by convincing them that the appearance of divine disinterest was actually keyed to the overwhelming force of God's grief pulsing imperceptibly through creation- a momentary glimpse into the divine pathos raging secretly on their behalf. 133 Rather than muting anguish, in other words, hidden weeping intensifies and authenticates pain while simultaneously shielding the world from its catastrophic effects. What is more, Rabbi Shapira argues in the lengthy and highly technical continuation of this sermon, that the battei gavai, or inner chambers where secret divine weeping is hidden, are ritually accessible within the text of the Torah, which "contracts" and modulates the infinite power of divine energy (which is to say, pain), much like a reactor core, into a form that finite humanity can perceive without shattering. It is certain that Rabbi Shapira refers not just to the text of Scripture when he says "Torah" in this context, but to the whole interwoven corpus of Jewish sacred textuality, including his own Hasidic sermons, whose production and study are without a doubt meant to be ritually efficacious in their own right.134 131 R. Moses Cordovero (Pardes Rimonim 8:12) for example, undertakes to elaborate the complex sefirotic architecture that underlies the Talmudic text according to the kabbalists, yet neglects the experience of grief implied by that text even when he describes the mystical significance of divine weeping. More striking still is the approach of his rough contemporary, Rabbi Judah Loeb (Maharal) of Prague, who also associates the "inner chambers" of battei gavei with the place of divine weeping, but writes that "weeping" is really just a metaphor of "lack" or "privation" (hisaron) in the philosophical sense, which can be attributed to the failings of human subjects who are unable to receive God's blessing in its fullness (Ba'er ha-Golah, Ba'er 4). Rabbi Shapira's contrary inclination is due not just to the distinction between the systematizer and the writer of Hasidic sermons, but also to the crucial role he attributes emotional and imaginative capacities in spiritual education, and his deep comfort with anthropopathic imagery. 132 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 160. 133 For a related argument about the intimacy revealed by divine weeping in a wartime sermon, see Greenberg, "A Musar Response to the Holocaust," 105-107. 134 On the status of the Hasidic sermon as "Torah," see Idel, Hasidism, 240-42. The association between Torah and battei gavei (the "secret place" of divine weeping) was already clear from earlier sources like Zohar III: 109a; R. Moses Cordovero, Pardes Rimonim 8:12; and Rabbi Isaac Luria, Sha'ar Ruah ha-Kodesh (the latter cited in Idel, Messianic Mystics, 315), and was well-established in Hasidic circles. See for instance Rabbi Shapira's ancestor, Rabbi Elimelekh of Lyzansk (No 'am Elimelekh 65b, Parashat Behar), who notes that simple people who have not studied Torah do not have access to this dimension of divine intimacy. Rabbi Samuel Borenstein of Sochachew likewise insists in a 1916 sermon (Shem mi-Shemuel, Parashat Tetzaveh) that there is a deep, affinity between penitential weeping and the cognitive study of Torah (especially Jewish law) because both derive from mohin (the brain), which is in this context a designation for battei gavei or the sefirah of binah</page><page sequence="35">DON SEEMAN 499 The stakes of this conception are actually quite high, because divine grief over the fate of Jews in Warsaw shades into the primordial pain of divine contraction, or tzimtzum, through which existence itself is allowed a space in which to unfold, a "suffering for the other" on divinity's part that the Torah reveals only to its most intimate students.135 It is axiomatic in Hasidism that both the Torah and the cosmos are created from the same divine speech, and this means that the divine weeping that is perceptible to scholarly adepts must also cause those adepts to reaffirm their consciousness of an ontic unity that encompasses both Torah and Ghetto in its purview. "When a man ascends and unifies with the voice of God that is in the Torah," writes Rabbi Shapira, "he hears Torah from all the sounds of the world; from the twittering of birds and the lowing of cattle and from the tumult of human beings . . . and thus all evil is lifted up [i.e., transformed] into good."136 While this kind of unity certainly undermines the vision of absolute and irredeemable evil in the holocaust world, it does not in any way compromise the adept's capacity for strategies of spiritual or ritual activism, like hamtaqat ha-dinim, or "sweetening of judgments," which is how kabbalists describe the "repair" of evil and suffering whose vitality must be "lifted" back to its divine source (in binah) before it can be "healed" through subsequent emanation.137 This is a ritual-theurgic construct that has ample precedent in earlier mystical and Hasidic teaching, yet no one before Rabbi Shapira identified the standard metaphors of "light," "abundance," and divine "vitality" so forcefully and insistently with the almost unthinkable mystery of transcendent divine pain.138 Ultimately, pain is just another expression of the divine effulgence. (see above, n. 109). Indeed, this may be implicit to Rabbi Shapira's decision to explore this theme in connection with the Torah portion known as mishpatim. On Torah study and mystical experience, see Moshe Idel, Absorbing Perfections: Kabbalah and Interpretation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002) 164-220. 135 Both R. Moses Cordovero (Pardes Rimonim 8:12) and Maharal {Ba'er ha-Golah, Ba'er 4) argue on exegetical grounds that the divine weeping envisioned by b. Hag. 5b is "constant weeping" (bekhiyyah temidit), which R. Cordovero relates to the process of divine emanation and contraction. 136 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 163. On the study of Torah as an avenue to mystical consciousness and unity with the divine in Polish Hasidism, see Brill, Thinking God, 235-66. 137 This "merged vita contemplativa et activa," writes Brody ("Open to Me the Gates of Righteous- ness,*' 25-27), constitutes "a path that is both contemplative and active, in which the Hasid learns to perceive and experience the non-dual unity of phenomena within the divine and acts to sustain their existence ... a reflection of the fact that kabbalah is a spirituality of cosmic blessing, using both mystical consciousness and ritual praxis as vehicles for the manifestation of divine presence and energy within the world." 138 Many Hasidic writers before Rabbi Shapira identified the text of the Torah as the secret place in which adepts could attain privileged access to, and experience of, God's unmediated presence. See Idel, "White Letters." But this is usually described as contact with a divine "voice" or "light," rather than the infinite sorrow of Rabbi Shapira's sermon. Human pain is much more frequently and less guardedly depicted as intrinsic to the articulation of divine vitality in this world. Already in the first generation of Hasidism, for example, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye writes: "I heard from my teacher [the Baal Shem Tov] . . . that since the creation of the world was effected through din</page><page sequence="36">500 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW This late Ghetto sermon presumes a high degree of spiritual virtuosity among its readers, but even readers who are unable to attain the deep perception of oneness that Rabbi Shapira describes are called upon to emulate God in self-mastery or hitgabrut, "provoking God, as it were, to master Himself as well, and send an influx of kindness to this world for all of our bodily needs."139 Issued only a week after he composed the "hidden weeping" sermon, this call for self-mastery returns to earlier and more modest demands upon listeners, since it is clear that hitgabrut (which is related to concepts like tzimtzum and "strengthening of the vessels") depends more upon force of will than on contemplative attainment. The vital point for our purposes here is simply that both "self-mastery" and "weeping in secret places" pertain to the psychic and cosmological dimensions of mystical teaching simultaneously. The Torah holds up not so much a "therapeutic model" for Rabbi Shapira as a ritual-salvific one, in which human and divine subjectivities model and participate in one another continually, on a variety of levels. The careful phenomenological description and management of human subjective states that defined Rabbi Shapira's pre-war and wartime literary output, and the ritual-theurgic gestures of hitgabrut or hamtaqat ha-dinim that effect cosmic blessing in the Ghetto, turn out upon closer examination to be one and the same. One important benefit of this ritual-theurgical model was, in fact, that it provided Rabbi Shapira with a set of ritual idioms like "shattering of vessels" and "blockage of vital flow" that also could serve as frameworks for talking about (and managing) dimensions of human experience that resist discursive elaboration, like the collapse of subjectivity in radical pain.140 One of the reasons that scholars of religion have had so much trouble acknowledging and analyzing these experiential states is that [divine judgment], which is contraction, and since in each and every world there was a contraction of His infinite light to a level that it could be received . . . [therefore] judgments and afflictions that a person suffers constitute a body to the soul and to the spiritual vitality that shines upon a person, which is His blessed divinity, the light of the En .So/ that enlivens all, and that [therefore] when a person welcomes affliction with joy and love he performs a unification, joining the vessel and body ... to the soul, which is joy and spiritual vitality." (Toledot Ya'akov Yosef, va-Ethanan: 16). Pain is here described as a "garment" or "body" rather than as divine vitality per se, but it is well-known in Hasidism that the garment itself is also constituted by the influx of divine vitality in a "coarser" and less accessible form. Human suffering can be described as a "body" to the light of divinity because suffering represents the necessary "contraction" through which human existence is made possible, and this means that human grief or weeping can also be construed with proper intent as efficacious channels for this power. See Shimon Menahem Mendl Gowartchov, Sefer Ba'al Shem Tov al ha-Torah (2 vols; Jerusalem, [1937] 1993) 1:184-86, where a number of sources related to this theme have been collected. Finally, see R. Dov Baer Schneersohn of Lubav itch's nineteenth- century essay on the conscription of Jewish troops to the Czarist army ('Inyan Lekihat Anshei Hayil, printed in Ma'amrei Admur ha-Emtsa'i, 261-277), where he cites many of the same proof texts as Rabbi Shapira in order to argue that "weeping in secret places" by human beings can help to draw vitality and blessing into the world. 139 Shapira, yEsh Kodesh, 169. 140 See Mary-Jo Delvecchio Good, Paul E.

The crucible of 'Esh Kodesh may help to point us towards a different set of strategies for writing about that which resists language in lived experience, and especially the experience of suffering. Elsewhere, I have argued that this realization should force us to rethink our assumptions about the relationship between suffering and ritual, which have been imbued since Weber with a bias towards secularized theodicy (the quest for meaning and coherence in the face of pain) at the expense of the multifaceted efficacy and ethical concern with which ritual is often associated in religious contexts.141 In Rabbi Shapira's case, I have argued that the impossible weight of suffering in Warsaw pushed ritual practice inexorably away from its meaning-making dimension and towards an increased emphasis on the essentially ethical gestures of bringing down blessing, defending the cosmos, and suffering for the other. It was precisely in reflection upon the experience of the Holocaust that the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas formulated his own rejection of theodicy and other meaning-oriented responses to suffering in modern times. "Suffering," he writes in phenomenological mode, "is surely a given in consciousness, a certain 'psychological content,' like the experience of color, of sound, of contact, or of any other experience. But in this 'content' itself, it is in-spite-of-consciousness, unassumable."142 Levinas refers to suffering as "useless" both because epochal modern atrocities like the Holocaust have outstripped the reach of secular and religious systems that purport to give them meaning and also because extreme suffering has always, in his view, resisted the imposition of meaning to some degree. "Taken as an 'experienced' content, the denial and refusal of meaning which is imposed as a sensible quality is the way in which the unbearable is precisely not borne by consciousness, the way this not-being-borne is, paradoxically, itself a sensation or given."143 The "not-being-borne" of suffering jibes poorly with the triumphal and meaning-oriented themes of our secular and religious cultures, yet 141 Seeman, "Otherwise than Meaning." 142 Levinas, "Useless Suffering," 156. While I can only touch briefly on these themes here, I have argued at length elsewhere (Seeman, "Otherwise than Meaning,") that the social science tradition of Weber and Geertz typically links ritual to theodicy by viewing ritual largely as a meaning-making or meaning-preserving response to the upheavals of suffering, and that this view may be challenged through a careful reading of writers like Levinas and Rabbi Shapira, each of whom associated ritual with the transcendence of self in responding to the pain of the other. For Levinas, theodicy is a false attempt to imbue suffering with meaning, and is related to Western philosophy's tragic privileging of ontology over ethics, or of the "problem of Being" over the problems of individual beings, which makes the fear of death more significant than the fear of committing murder. Levinas has in mind, of course, his one-time teacher Martin Heidegger, who became a proponent of National Socialism in Germany, but leverages this into a much broader critique of certain trends in Western thought. It is interesting in this context to note that while Levinas explicitly eschewed Jewish mystical cosmology, he sought to preserve the "inimitable resources" of this language. See Elliot Wolfson, "Secrecy, Modesty, and the Feminine: Kabbalistic Traces in the Thought of Levinas," Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy 14 (2006) 193-224. 143 Levinas, "Useless Suffering," 156.</page><page sequence="38">502 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW I know of no better way to describe Rabbi Shapira's vulnerable matriarch Sarah, or his immeasurably hidden divine weeping. Like Rabbi Shapira, Levinas argues intuitively that ritual practice may sometimes bear more similarity to the "medical gesture" of intervention to end suffering than to the realm of theodicy and meaning- making that always strives to make suffering "sufferable."144 For Levinas, this means that what he calls ethics, must come to take the place of theodicy in human life. Yet Rabbi Shapira surpasses the philosopher in his ability to give expression to this intuition in a way that is more readily compatible with the taken-for-granted religiosity of so many of those who suffered, and with the ritual frames of Jewish piety. â–  On Uselessness and Efficacy Several factors have contributed to the neglect of ritual efficacy and "useless suffering" among readers of 'Esh Kodesh. In academic research, claims to ritual efficacy are often transmuted into claims about the "meaningfulness" of practice that reinforce deeply rooted religious and intellectual biases against the recognition of ritual power.145 Along similar lines, anthropologists and others often try to sidestep the problem of belief that inevitably arises when claims to efficacy are examined by skeptical outsiders- e.g., "do they really believe in the power of witchcraft?"- because it is felt that asking this question will conjure nearly insurmountable ethical and epistemological dilemmas relating to the portrayal of other people's rationality.146 Yet I would argue that ignoring such problems never really solves them, and that we owe Rabbi Shapira at least the honor of being faithful to his words and the spirit in which they were written. Academic Hasidic studies are still, with some exceptions, dominated by an intellectualist frame that resists the focus on ritual efficacy I have been advocating. And in Rabbi Shapira's case, there is also the added factor that claims to ritual efficacy in the Holocaust ring so crushingly hollow- and for some readers so plainly offensive- in its aftermath. In order to speak convincingly about efficacy in this context, we need to be prepared to speak with equal clarity about the potential for failure.147 144 Seeman, Otherwise than Meaning." 145 Ibid. Also see Seeman, "Ritual and its Discontents," and Asad, Genealogies of Religion. 146 Some of the most provocative treatments of this problem are Byron Good, Medicine, Rationality and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994); Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, Medicine, Science and the Scope of Rationality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990); T. M. Luhrmann, Persuasions of the Witch's Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1989). 147 By insisting on the possibility of ritual failure, my intent is certainly not the positivistic assumption that efficacy can be judged only from a standpoint of technical, utilitarian rationality. On the contrary, I am arguing that we need to attend to the ways in which efficacy and claims about efficacy emerge in the texts that we study. How do Hasidic texts themselves portray what is at stake in the efficacy that they seek? See Kleinman and Seeman, "The Politics of Moral Practice"; also Douglas Hoi Ian, "Suffering and the Work of Culture: A Case of Magical Poisoning in Toraja," American Ethnologist 21 (1994) 74-87.

"To have had that vision [of evil's transmutation into good]," writes Nehemia Polen, "to have had the courage to publicly expound it, at that time and in that place, was itself the ultimate triumph over, and transformation of, evil. By his example and by his teaching, Rabbi Shapira did indeed prevail."148 Moshe Idel, too, felt it necessary to conclude his innovative work on ritual power in Hasidism by suggesting that the resilience of Hasidic life after genocide testifies to the way in which "the 'magic' of language is sometimes able to prevail over the efficiency of technology."149 It is not difficult to sympathize with such claims, yet we may also feel compelled to ask what analytic work these assertions perform, and whether "magic," to use Idel's term, really did prevail. Rabbi Shapira and all of his surviving compatriots were deported to a concentration camp following the Warsaw Ghetto uprising that began on Passover in 1943. They were later shot.150 yEsh Kodesh remains probably the last work of traditional Jewish and Hasidic scholarship ever composed on Polish soil, home before the war to over three million Jews and to one of the most vibrant centers of Jewish cultural and religious life. Perhaps more to the point is that Rabbi Shapira's own writing testifies on almost every page to the awful contingency of any and all such claims to overcoming. He calls our attention with endless and numbing regularity to the terrifying costs and ambivalence imposed even by survival in the Ghetto context, and to the fragility of those achieved and emergent faculties - such as confidence in one's own subjectivity and compassion for others- that create conditions for being human. Would Rabbi Shapira himself have written so casually, had he survived, about the "victory of language?"151 is a different problem entirely- see Brian K. Smith, "Ritual Perfection and Ritual Sabotage in the Veda," History of Religions 35 (1996) 285-306. 148 Polen, The Holy Fire, 135. Polen acknowledges (ibid., x) that his research on 'Esh Kodesh was slowed by the difficulty of gazing at "the awesome pain of that period for extended lengths of time. The work often proceeded by off-axis vision, as a naked-eye astronomer might view a heavenly body, except that in this case the phenomenon radiated darkness rather than light/' 149 Idel, Hasidism, 223. "Today it is sufficient to observe," Idel writes, "even superficially, the descendants of the various nineteenth-century trends of Hasidism to see that the terrible encounter between their ancestors, in their strongholds in Poland and Russia, and the bearers of scientific- mythological Nazism, was unable to extirpate their vital religiosity." 150 The best account, while necessarily somewhat speculative, remains Polen, The Holy Fire, 152-56. 151 Jews have not of course been the only people in modern times to oppose "the efficiency of [a murderous] technology" with recourse to the "magic of language," nor have they been the only people who arguably failed to attain their salvation in this way. For just one ethnographic example of what may be considered a paradigmatic modern catastrophe, see Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution: Christianity, Colonialism and Consciousness in South Africa (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991), where the anthropologists describe some of the "magical" and conceptual defenses of the Tswana against political, techno-military and conceptual conquest by Europeans. It is worthwhile in this context to ponder Jonathan Boyarin's provocative suggestion that European Jews be compared with other colonized people as the "internally colonized" people of Europe.

"To the best of my knowledge," writes Kimmy Kaplan, "almost all Haredi and national-religious groups in Israel share a preoccupation with the writings of Rabbi Kalonimys-Kelmish Shapira ... the Rabbi of Piaseczno." Yet he also notes that they focus mostly on his wartime 'Esh Kodesh, and that each group "presents its readers with his writings, and interprets them in various, at times conflicting ways."152 A few years ago I stumbled upon a daylong public forum devoted entirely to Rabbi Shapira's teachings, held in Yiddish on a minor fast day commemorating ancient travails in one of Jerusalem's burgeoning ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. Rabbi Shapira may well have felt at home in that scene of reconstructed Old- World piety, despite the chasm of time and circumstance that necessarily separates him from yeshiva students in contemporary Jerusalem or Bnei Brak. Yet looks can also be deceiving. The popular media of contemporary ultra-Orthodoxy tends to invoke the Holocaust primarily for its timeless and generalized icons of unshakeable faith and miraculous salvation, or as a way of calling attention to the human failings (Jewish sinfulness and Gentile anti-Semitism) that contributed to the catastrophe.153 How does such a message sit with Rabbi Shapira's depiction of "faith" as a kind of vulnerable prophetic influx- a particular register of subjectivity on the divine-human continuum- or with his openly expressed doubt as to whether such an experience was still at all possible for himself and others in Warsaw? "Prophecy is impossible in a state of sadness," he writes in his penultimate Ghetto essay of July 1942, and "even homiletic exegesis of the affliction [like that which constitutes 'Esh Kodesh] is impossible when a person is broken and fallen down. How then can a person strengthen himself at least a little until salvation comes?"154 How, in essence, can a defiant post-Holocaust Orthodoxy absorb the twin fears voiced by Rabbi Shapira's 'Esh Kodesh, that all of his strategies for ritual efficacy might simply fail or that even their success might leave him guilty of a betrayal toward those for whom he cared the most? Ritual failure is both too difficult and too easy to contemplate. Too difficult because the reader wants Rabbi Shapira to emerge in some way victorious, if only to believe that such victories are still possible. Yet too easy, because the language of technical, utilitarian efficacy that disavows "linguistic magic" in favor of a putative 152 This is an observation that calls out for further ethnographic investigation.

Piekarz, Ideological Trends, and Schweid, From Ruin to Salvation, 126 have also noted the apparent difficulty of reconciling 'Esh Kodesh with many contemporary myths about religious life and "spiritual resistance" during the holocaust. 154 Shapira, 'Esh Kodesh, 191.</page><page sequence="41">DON SEEMAN 505 realism seems both descriptively and morally unequal to the burden imposed upon readers of a text like 'Esh Kodesh. The strategy I have advocated instead is one that recognizes efficacy as always "complex, differentially constructed, even contested in experience" and irreducible to any single cultural or theological template.155 As readers, we need to focus on the contingency of the author's own struggle as revealed by the text, and resist the impulse to claim some elusive or simplifying resolution. 'Esh Kodesh is indeed an integrated work as Polen claims, but its successive sermons map the shifting, sometimes interrelated, and occasionally incommensurate forms of efficacy that Rabbi Shapira struggled to achieve over time in a ritual-experiential continuum, from the literal and physical salvation of Jews in Poland to the defense of prophetic empathy; from the "sweetening" of cosmic judgments to the most intimate modulations of emotional and moral life, and readers should engage the indeterminacy suggested by the text at each of these levels. There is power in 'Esh Kodesh to unsettle many of our habitual practices of reading and thinking, but this is only true when it is approached as it was written, with a view to ritual and hermeneutic strategies rather than foregone ideological conclusions, and to lived experience in suffering rather than doctrine. Like the classical Hasidic texts that Rabbi Shapira described and commented upon throughout his career, 'Esh Kodesh was intended to do more than just educate or console its readers, or to develop an articulate religious ideology that could in theory be abstracted from its literary frame. It was an intervention in subjectivity, a privileged site for the "revelation of the soul" and of the divine immanence that "fills and surrounds all worlds."156 Yet because of the devastating circumstances in which it was written and the vulnerable yet resilient humanity of its author, 'Esh Kodesh also served at least one other purpose in the Warsaw Ghetto that may be difficult for us at this cultural and historical remove to grasp. In making a space for thinking and living with pain in such extremity, this text also served as the one place remaining in which its author could still respond to an echo of the infinite divine grief he had come to perceive at the heart of creation, and deep within his own heart. 155 Arthur Kleinman, Writing at the Margin: Discourse Between Anthropology and Medicine (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995) 10.
