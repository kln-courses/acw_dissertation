<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Colossus of Plymouth Hammatt Billings's National Monument to the Forefathers JAMES F. O'GORMAN, Wellesley College The National Monument to the Forefathers at Plymouth, Massachusetts, is one of the more lugubrious deposits of mid-nineteenth-century American ideals.' It stands largely unremarked on Allerton Hill, back from and above the harbor village that was one of Europe's gateways to the New World. It is an 81-foot apparition of solid Hallowell granite composed of a 36-foot figure entitled Faith, bestride an octagonal, 45-foot pedestal surrounded by seated 15-foot figures entitled Liberty, Education, Law, and Morality [Figure 1]. Despite its colossal size it is a neglected work; despite its "realism" it is a puzzling presence. The puzzle stems from the elaborate iconography, which requires the viewer to inventory and interpret thirteen major and minor figures, four reliefs, and several inscriptions, a tedious task for our impatient age, and one that results in the following detailed but unavoidable description.2 Faith is a 180-ton sculpture of a large-featured, classically draped female who stands with one foot on Plymouth Rock. She holds a Bible in her left hand and points heavenward with her right.Her only other significant attribute is a single star above her forehead. The heroic ancillary figures, each weighing 20 to 25 tons, are seated on diagonal buttresses. Liberty [Figure 2] is a carapaced male wearing a helmet, draped with a lion's skin, cradling a sword in his right arm, and holding a broken chain in his other hand. Small figures on the sides of his chair represent peace (woman holding a cornucopia) and tyranny (king laid low). On his pedestal is a relief depicting the landing of the Pilgrims [Figure 3]. Education is a draped woman pointing to a book in her lap. The small figures on her chair represent wisdom (bearded man with book and globe) and youth (woman and child). The relief on her pedestal depicts the signing of the Mayflower Compact. Law is a draped male also holding a book. His chair is supported by Mercy (draped orante) and Justice (woman with scales and sword). The first treaty with the Indians is shown in relief [Figure 4]. Morality, finally, is a woman holding a book inscribed "GOD" who sits above a relief showing the embarkation from Delft-Haven. Her chair contains small fig- ures representing an evangelist (writing in a book) and a prophet (Moses holding the tablets of the Law and looking to heaven). Two of the inscriptions list the names of the passen- gers on the Mayflower. The principal text bears this dedication: NATIONAL / MONUMENT / TO THE / FOREFATHERS / ERECTED / BY A / GRATEFUL PEOPLE / IN REMEM- BRANCE OF / THEIR / LABORS, SACRIFICES / AND SUF- FERINGS / FOR THE / CAUSE OF CIVIL / AND / RELI- GIOUS LIBERTY. There is no mistaking the meaning of any of this, for the name of each figure is clearly inscribed in the stone, but such an elaborate allegorical concoction nevertheless defies easy interpretation by the average visitor, even one who bothers to catalogue its many parts. This overwhelming and ungainly work rises from the top of a remote hill in an otherwise residential neighborhood [Figure 5]. Although its presence counts in the broad configuration of village, land-, and seascape, its immediate location is a ne- glected plot of grass.3 There is parking on Allerton Street, and a tourist shack off to the left, placed there by the monument's sponsors and owners, the Pilgrim Society. Especially out of season this is at once a public and a forlorn place. One wonders what the casual tourist derives from visiting this work, with its traditional allegorical allusions and ponderous anthropomor- phic forms that are so out of step with late twentieth-century attitudes. Do modem travelers connect with anything here? They may sense that a figure so big must represent something important, but it is doubtful that it speaks to them directly, and even more doubtful that, in our more skeptical and historically ill-informed age, it conjures up much of the patriotism that inspired it. Certainly it conveys to the fleeting visitor little of the filiopietism, the nationalist aspirations, or the political turmoil that brought it into being. It looms large in mass but vague in content. Some tourists understand that the monument celebrates (some of) the first European settlers of the New World, but how it does that is less obvious. Even for them it must be a curious survivor from an era in the history and art of America that is long and easily left forgotten. In fact, as originally conceived- for, as large as the landmark now is, what is there on Allerton Hill is a diminished realization of the initial intention-the National Monument to the Forefathers did more than honor 278 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="2">407 'WW F/- V A*9 ;0001 lid . . . . . . . . ....

It bespoke the hopes of New England Unionists in an era-the 1850s-in which the integrity of the United States was seriously threatened. The huge, awkward monument, now more or less ignored as road-weary travelers congregate at the Rock, conveniently located near the fish houses and souvenir shops at harbor's edge, may not qualitatively enhance the art or easily explicate the history of the country, but the study of its conception and realization-a story that stretched from the early 1850s into the late 1880s-can tell us much about the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

THE PILGRIM SOCIETY In Plymouth today, it is the "1620" Rock in its 1920 McKim, Mead and White-designed setting that is the aim of the modem pilgrim, as it has long been popularly assumed to have been the point of landing of the original Pilgrims. The Rock itself is underwhelming in its ordinariness, and its Tuscan pavilion a work of pedestrian classicism, but the spot is obvi- ously important within the context of modern Plymouth. Before the early nineteenth century no such honored site was in evidence. In the eighteenth century the Rock was embedded in a wharf. In Revolutionary times it gained some attention, for in 1774 an attempt was made to free it that resulted in its splitting in two (seen as an omen of separation from England). The lower part was left in place and the upper moved to Town Square, where it stood in casual display until 1834, when it was again moved, this time to a fenced place of honor in front of the new uptown hall of the Pilgrim Society. In 1880 it was rejoined to its lower half at the present site (but beneath a very different canopy designed before and erected just after the Civil War).4 Colonial indifference to the landing was replaced in the early republic by a veneration of the past born of growing national self-consciousness. The placement of part of the Rock in front of Pilgrim Hall was no accident. The Pilgrim Society was founded during the 200th anniversary of the landing for the express purpose of providing "a plot for the erection of a monument to perpetuate the virtues, the enterprise, and the unparalleled suffering of the ancestors."5 But realization took time. Thirty years later, in May 1850, with few funds yet on hand for the project, the society was still talking, still resolving "to erect a monument on or near the Rock."6 With the advent of mid-century, the plan began to take on more definite shape. 280 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="4">Word of the Pilgrim Society's 1850 resolution to erect a monument seems to have reached Portsmouth, New Hamp- shire, by early the next year, for in a note to the Boston Weekly Museum in January 1851, the Reverend Rufus Wheelwright Clark (1813-1866) of that city wrote that "if the monument should bear any proportion to the singularity of the event which it would ... commemorate, it would tower above all similar works ... in our country. Let us erect ... a monument of New-England granite, which, like the hopes of the Pilgrims, shall ascend to the skies, pointing heavenward."7 Apparently before a designer had begun to work, then, three essential characteristics of the monument as erected had been proposed: its colossal size, its native material, and its upward point. Since the Reverend Clark mentions no figure, however, he probably had in mind a column or obelisk to rival those previously dedicated to a Revolutionary battle and a Revolutionary hero in Boston, Baltimore, and Washington. In any event, a note a year later in the Boston Transcript explicitly made such a connection: "It is proposed," it said, "to erect upon that portion of the ... Rock which still remains at the water's side ... a towering column of granite which shall only be exceeded in its dimen- sions by that now erecting at Washington."8 Where the uniden- tified writer found this (mis)information is unknown. These references make it certain that minds were at work on the proper form for a memorial at Plymouth from very early in the decade, but in fact it was not until June 1853 that the trustees of the Pilgrim Society appointed a committee "to advertise for the plan of a monument on or over Plymouth Rock &amp; offer $100 premium for approved design"; and, that proposal having met with some difficulty in committee, it was not until the meeting in July 1854 that the society's president was authorized "to obtain plans for a monument, and submit same with estimates to the Board."' The premium was now set at $300. In what we shall see was a significant provision, the trustees reserved the right to refuse all proposals. A call for submissions appeared in the Boston Transcript (and probably JL.L . . . . .. . . . .. . . . .. . . ..........- - .......... ...... ..

Noury," and "Bond" of Boston, as well as "Asboth &amp; Zucker" and another, unnamed entrant from New York. These projects were the work of architects about whom we know all too little. Richard Bond (1798-1861) had designed Gore Hall in the Gothic style and the Italianate Lawrence Scientific School for Harvard College in the 1830s and 1840s.1'0 "Schultz" was probably Paul Schulze (1827-1897), who was soon to win the competition to build Harvard's new Appleton Chapel."I More important, he was in the early 1850s publishing a series of designs for funereal and other monuments. They are largely architectural with some secondary sculptural embellish- ment [Figure 6].12 Noury appears in Boston directories for 1853 in association with one E. A. Launay. He was probably the Andr6 Noury recently described as the "unknown French architect" who provided the preliminary plans for the Boston Theater of 1854.13 Alexander Sandor Asboth (1811-1868), Hungarian patriot, had studied engineering and fought with Kossuth.14 Asboth fought again for the Union during the Civil War, and died (as the result of battle wounds) as United States minister to the Argentine Republic.'5 Gerhard Zucker remains a shadowy figure.16 With the exception of Asboth &amp; Zucker's, we know nothing about the submitted proposals. We know little enough about Asboth's. When the projects were received the trustees voted to ask these partners for "more accurate information concerning the nature of the material suggested [zinc &amp;c for images]," and at a later meeting, on 20 December, when "Col. Asboth" was said to be "entitled to the premium," some members still wanted more information and alternative designs with and without "allegorical &amp; other decorative figures." If the pro- posed monument could stand without these figures, it too must have been largely architectural with secondary sculptural ac- cents, rather than anthropomorphic. Judging from the designs in Schulze's portfolios, this was perhaps also true of the other proposals. HAMMATT BILLINGS Although it does not appear in the Trustees Minutes at this point, there was one more proposal in the works. Since early 1854 Boston's Hammatt Billings (1818-1874) had been think- ing about a Forefathers monument that was very different from those predominately architectural designs.17 Billings had by then more than a dozen years of practice as illustrator, de- signer, and architect. His wide-ranging production included funerary monuments, such as a neoclassical aedicule (1848) for Robert Gould Shaw in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, and a Gothic Revival pinnacle (1851) for Edmund Dwight in Forest Hills Cemetery, Roxbury, as well as figurative allegorical compositions for book and periodical illustration.18 In a letter to Billings of 26 March 1854 Catharine Beecher, sister of Harriet Beccher Stowe, whose Uncle Tom's Cabin Billings had illustrated just two years earlier, wrote that she had "heard your ... time was to be given to your great design" once other work was complete.19 By the end of May, a full three months before the Pilgrim Society's call for proposals appeared in the Boston papers, that "great design" had advanced far enough for its creator to describe it to Winslow Warren of the society. In a letter to Billings of the first ofJune, Warren acknowledged receipt of the proposal (this communication apparently does not survive) but noted that the trustees were "not at present authorized to act ... upon ... any particular design," although they would soon call for ideas. He went on to caution Billings, however, that the trustees had been charged to erect the monument on or near the Rock, and that the magnitude and cost of his project would mean its rejection, as evidence suggested that the public would not contribute money for "structures of this sort." Warren was clearly referring to the ELE VA TIO . .7 J FIGURE 6: B. W. Thayer lithograph in Paul Schulze, Original Designs in Monumental Art (Boston, 185 1). 282 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="6">problems and delays experienced, as we shall see, by the Bunker Hill and Washington monuments. And he was also clearly referring to a proposal for a monument that was great in size and removed from the Rock, and this suggests that Billings's concept was generally formed between March and May 1854. In his resistance to Billings's showy project Warren may have been reflecting, among more generally suspicious Protestant attitudes toward figural plastic art, a specifically local prejudice. At least according to Horatio Greenough, New England balked at grandeur. "I havejust finished a colossal bust of Franklin," he wrote on 25 February 1839, "which I think of sending to Philadelphia or New York, as I find you Bostonians are not fond of the colossal."20 Answering Winslow Warren two days after hearing from him, Billings began a year-long campaign to overcome such resistance, to win the commission for a colossal figure by explicitly linking the monument along a continuum between a heroic past and a thankful future. He insisted that the descendants of the Pilgrims think "no monument can be on a scale of too great grandeur, nor can it be made too imperish- able, to express to the full the sense of obligation which is felt towards them, and the grateful affection with which their memory is cherished." As to cost, he continued, "certainly it is within the means of a nation of twenty three million of freemen to erect such a memorial as shall convey to a... remote posterity the memory of this event, characterized by Mr. [Daniel] Webster as 'the greatest in our history.'" Having evoked the memory of the region's late great orator and statesman, he asked for permission to counter the impression that his scheme was "little less than Quixotic." Nothing of Billings's argument was original; it was, rather, common enough at the time in proposals to erect memorials. In his letter to Warren, Billings seems to draw upon ideas expressed at least as early as 1819 in an article on a proposed Scottish national monument in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. It remains to be seen whether he read the original paper or encountered its ideas as reechoed and amplified by others. Nationalism, filiopietism, and the continuity of past events with future hopes are all expressed by the author, the younger Archibald Alison (1792-1867).21 The monument, Alison as- serts, is "best suited to animate the exertions of her [Scotland's] remotest descendants..,. it will stand at once the monument of former greatness, and the pledge of future glory." Five days after his note to Warren, on 8 June 1854, in a letter to an unnamed recipient (probably the Plymouth antiquarian, William Russell), Billings began to exhibit what must have been formidable powers of persuasion in defense of his design and its projected cost against Warren's objections. "As the grandeur of the proposed mon[umen]t would be the great part upon which I should rely in addressing the public mind, &amp; costliness is a mere matter of circumstance to be taken into consideration, not by itself, but in connection with many others," he needed to show the design to the trustees. And to this end he was having made a model, which, on 12 June, in a letter to Richard Warren of the society, he said would probably be ready about the first of July. "Much depends upon the energy and system with which the public is addressed," he wrote. "The success of any design, is predicated upon the effect which its magnitude and grandeur will have in awakening the feeling of the Public and in the method by which I propose to collect the funds." By the late spring of 1854, then, he had a design in hand and a scheme in mind for raising the funds necessary to erect it, and wanted to meet the trustees to show off his model and explain his proposal. Meanwhile, he began to enlist powerful political support outside of Plymouth by proposing to show the model to Governor John H. Clifford. Clifford was then honorary president of the Massachusetts Academy of Fine Arts, a short- lived Boston artists' club ofwhich Billings was a director.22 All of this, it should be remembered, occurred before the trustees voted definitively to advertise for proposals! Billings had clearly heard tell of the project from contacts close to the Pilgrim Society. By the end of 1854 Asboth's design had been premiated, and early in February 1855 he asked the committee to appoint him architect of the monument. But at this point Asboth and Billings, who had not previously appeared in the trustees' minutes, crossed paths. At their February meeting the trustees authorized a letter to Asboth informing him that they were not ready to appoint an architect, and that, although he was entitled to the premium, they did not feel bound to erect his design. They then appointed a committee to confer with Billings about his proposal. Two weeks later, on 27 February, Billings appeared before the trustees, and, although no model is mentioned in the minutes, it can assumed that it was presented at this time. Billings's lobbying had paid off. The Trustees Minutes for 28 May 1855 describe Asboth and Zucker as "two Hungarian gentlemen of New York." In an undated, unsigned, and unaddressed letter in Billings's hand- writing preserved at the Pilgrim Society that must stem from this time, Billings wrote that he felt "that the honor of the country is somewhat concerned in the affair, and that as it is to be a National Mon[umen]t it should be the work of a native artist." Billings, whose full name was Charles Howland Ham- matt Billings, and who could claim John Howland of the Mayflower as his ancestor, here seems to use the xenophobic prejudices of the contemporary Know-Nothings to promote his cause.23 Billings's politics are not completely understood, but a passing snide reference in a letter of 1854 to the pushy financial practices of "Young America," a term usually associated with the Democrats, as well as his many contacts within the party, suggests his sympathy, at least, with the Whigs.24 As we shall see, Billings's monument seems to reflect political ideals that were O'GORMAN: COLOSSUS OF PLYMOUTH 283</page><page sequence="7">Whiggishly inclined, at least as those ideals were dedicated to Union-saving as championed by Daniel Webster and Edward Everett, among others. But political distinctions were then rather muddled, and in 1854 Whigs and Know-Nothings mightjoin forces when it came to issues such as the divisiveness of slavery.25 In any event, this nativist appeal also worked. In March, Asboth and Zucker were voted the $300 premium, paid, and, in effect, dismissed. In early April the trustees named a committee to negotiate with Billings, and on 23 May 1855 the two parties signed a contract for not one but two monuments, a document that also gave Billings the authority to solicit the funds necessary for their erection. Billings, it seems, thought the monument site the society had stipulated, on or near the Rock, while it had historical validity, offered little as an appropriate venue for his grand vision. He therefore split the society's program in two. The contract called, on the one hand, for a "mon[umen]t of granite decorated with four bronze statues" to be erected "over or upon" the Rock and to be completed within three years of 1 August 1856. This was to comply with the society's wishes to commemorate the landing at its putative site. But the contract also called for a second, more imposing monument, Billings's "great design." He was to erect in Plymouth, on land he would select within one-half mile of the Rock and which he would donate to the Pilgrim Society, the National Monument to the Forefathers, "a plan and complete description and specifica- tions of which accompany this document." It was to be com- pleted within twelve years. Billings was appointed architect and superintendent with the authority to solicit and receive subscrip- tions for these works in the name of the Pilgrim Society. Billings hired the Reverend Willard M. Harding (d. 1880) as the general and financial agent for fundraising for the Forefa- thers monument. Expenses were estimated at $300,000. Money would be solicited in a nationwide, grassroots effort through a system of state or regional representatives. Premiums were offered for donations. In the original proposal of 1855, every contributor would receive a certificate printed from a steel plate. Donations of $5 would earn a steel engraving of the monument and a life membership in the Pilgrim Society [Figure 7]. A donation of $50 added a bronze medal to the engraving.26 A 20-inch bronze statuette [Figure 8] was offered for $100, a 30-inch statuette of bronze and silver for $500, and a 36-inch statuette for $1,000.27 As we shall see, funds came in slowly and were significantly disrupted by the Civil War. Nonetheless, these cast and engraved premiums ensured a broad distribu- tion of knowledge about the appearance of Billings's colossal monument. We know Billings's first design for the National Monument to the Forefathers from two sources. In his letter of 8 June 1854 he wrote that he had a small, sketchy model of the project that was unsatisfactory, that he had made arrangements to have iiqua + mi FIGURE 7: Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson engraving after Hammatt Billings, Pilgrim Society Certificate, copyright 1856. made "one much larger &amp; finish it perfectly before exhibiting it to the Public." He thought it would be ready by the first ofJuly. This may well be the "miniature model ... byJ.A.Jackson" that was exhibited two years later at the fair of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, and that may well be the approximately seven-foot-high plaster model of the monu- ment that once stood in Pilgrim Hall and is now housed in the Plymouth Public Library [Figures 9 and 22].28 John Adams Jackson (1825-1879) was a Boston sculptor who returned from a European sojourn in 1854. We know from documents at the Pilgrim Society that he modeled the smaller metal statuettes of the monument that went for premiums to donors to the cause, but these documents date from 1857-1858, so the model exhibited in 1856 cannot have been one of them.29 The second source is the series of engraved views of the monument that began to be published soon after the signing of the contract. These disagree with one another in details-suggesting that in some particulars the design was still in flux-but, with the accompanying description, they provide us with a generally accurate conception of Billings's proposal. The statues and the engraved premiums make it certain that Billings designed a more graceful and lithe figural composition than that finally achieved nearly a quarter of a century later. 284 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="8">1:-...I-~ L~I .??. it~L?~B-~-s~~~s~i ~.-i5--.i -;-i???',--_e~~--~a~~t3? ? ??~::i??~.-ai._?-~i-?'B1:?-`~~?:~ ..:. --:'1 '-- :I-i ' -'- li- :--i-:i- - i-:_ ii :. :~-----_; .iii-~::,--i_::ii---::::.-'` i?_I--1-~? i--:-::?.~?i?-- ~~~_'~:~-~-ii~i?.,~~:~l_~?i ..L~~n_ -----f: - I?:-?-?? : -.~:_~~-~-i?~-T-;?-?-?--:`?-'-?--__?'?~- i_:---.i~-_--~?:-? ?'- --?1 ::: _ .- : ~_____~-:--~1-;~.~S~_~~4-~?1?-:-~~_~-~~_ --:: :: -: ::::::--::--:-~:.~?,.?!~_:-_:-:~ : _ __ I:_I:- -I~-I~ -j I::.~~ :5 ?--?._~___---- -:4 i :. ? ~?I~~-~~- ' : I : I- i i :- .. :: : : : ::::l:i- ...: -- i- -- 1:-- : :: . :--:.1:--- i i _ : .1!1 - : - I- , : : I ~._--i-: :- .; FIGURE 8: John Adams Jackson after Hammatt Billings, premium statuette of the National Monument to the Forefathers, 1857- 1867. The primary figure in Billings's proposal was Faith (or the "Spirit of Religion" in some early descriptions). As depicted in an engraving published in 1856 in the Illustrated Magazine, she conforms in most details, except those of her drapery, with the statue modeled by Jackson and the view in an engraved certificates copyrighted 1 September 1855 [Figure 10].3o The magazine describes an immense monument: a 70-foot granite figure rising above an 83-foot base. She stands "upon a rock, holding in her left hand an open Bible, while the other hand is uplifted towards heaven." That was intended as an oratorical gesture: "Looking downward, as to those she is addressing, she seems to call them to trust in a higher power."31 The 40-foot ancillary figures, "emblematic of the principles upon which the Pilgrim Fathers proposed to found their Commonwealth," were Morality, Law, Education, and Freedom. The inscribed panels were to be of "porphyry, serpentine, or other hard stone," and the inscriptions inlaid with white marble. The project called for reliefs entitled Departure from Delft-Haven, Signing of the Social Compact in the Cabin of the "Mayflower," Landing at Plymouth, and First Treaty with the Indians, all of white marble. (We might expect to find the first Thanksgiving depicted on such a monument, but, while it was an important feast day in Massachusetts at the time, it did not gain its current national prestige until the presidency of Abraham Lincoln.32) The base would contain a chamber, 24 feet in diameter, with a stone staircase leading to a platform at the feet of Faith, from which local landmarks might be viewed.33 iiii? !! :: :._:_? ; ?. i iiiiV- i i  ! i: _# ;:;ii~ ;:; iiii ,:1- i-- l:: ?' :: ::i i i  l :i~ ::i i FIGURE 9: John Adams Jackson after Hammatt Billings, model of the National Monument to the Forefathers, 1854.

In the earliest engravings of the monument only two of the ancillary figures are visible: Morality, who holds the Decalogue in her left hand, the scroll of Revelation in her right, and looks "upward toward the impersonation of the Spirit of Religion above her," and Law, a young man in the pose of a thinker who balances a stack of books on his knees (see Fig. 10). These two figures flank the front of the monument. By 1856 the represen- tation of law had changed into an older, bearded man [see Fig. 7]. In all of these earlier versions, including (originally) Jack- son's model, Freedom is seated to Morality's left; he was eventu- ally moved to her right, to the frontal position formerly occupied by Law.34 There he sits today. Billings's proposal contains elements not found in the monument erected on Allerton Hill. In the event, Liberty replaced Freedom among the principles of the Pilgrims; Law lost his beard, some of his books, and his thoughtful posture; the design of the chairs upon which the allegorical figures are seated changed; and the entrance, interior room, and viewing platform were eliminated. In addition, the rock upon which Faith stands became (early on in the evolution of the work) Plymouth Rock, an emphasized feature that required a change in her stance and other changes in her drapery.35 But more significantly, the existing 81-foot memorial, as overbearing as it is, scarcely measures up to the colossal 153-foot overall height of Billings's proposal. The monument as erected is big, but the original conception had the dimensions to stir the blood. THE COLOSSAL TRADITION Which was, of course, the point. Billings wrote as much in his letter to the trustees. He had carefully measured his monument against the colossi of history. In the first published descriptions it was said to be "the grandest work of the kind in the world."36 "In magnitude ... [it was to] far exceed any monumental structure of modem times, and ... equal those stupendous works of the Egyptians." According to the Illustrated Magazine of 1856 Faith was to be "larger than any known statue, excepting that of the great Ramses ... and the Colossus of Rhodes; and the sitting figures ... nearly equal in size to the two statues of Ramses in the plain of Luxor." In 1860 appeared The Illustrated Pilgrim Almanac, sold "in Aid of the Monument Fund," with a series of engravings after drawings by Billings of ancient and modern colossi, including the Colossus of Rhodes, a marvel of the third century B.C. [Figure 11], and Giovanni Battista Crespi's early seventeenth-century San Carlo Borromeo on the Lago Maggiore, 23 meters high on a 12-meter pedestal [Figure 12]. Billings conceived the first colossal figure to be eventually erected (however reduced) in the United States, although, as we shall see, F3d6ric Auguste Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty has precedence of dedication. When Billings began to think about a monument to the Forefathers there were two outstanding nationalistic memorials for him to study: the Bunker Hill obelisk in Boston and the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia. Begun in the 1820s but not finished because of difficulties with fundrais- ing until 1843, Solomon Willard's 220-foot granite shaft cel- ebrated a memorable Boston battle of the Revolutionary War.37 Billings knew it well, for he had provided a drawing for an engraving of it for the Boston Miscellany of Literature and Fashion " "~"-~' ""~ `;;~;;;;;;;'~;" :~:~--~~ -~-~---i-`~---~-~ I'~'~""" ; ; :'::;";;~- :---;~~'-I~ ~~~~~ ;------~-~~"?'~`~""";~"';'~~;';' ' '~~ ~~;~~';~; B: -t: r/ ?i.$i ? -i? !?-r II II I j i iii~- ; 1 -I--:---;i;!!i;;;-----;-:-;; _a-:-:i_-i;i? ii i;: i i--? i .. --; ; i.:;i-? : rs;ai-* :~~iiiiiiiiii li~iiii?s;i~;.;ii :.ii: i' ""~:.:f.;A_ i ii?.:-i"iisp:lii-ii-i;:_i -ij?_i:?ii/?-i~Li-- .- ; - --;i-i:ii_ ii-i~~;i-a:i i;i.iiiir?- ~:lil?%?:E;i-i--_-l:;YB~db~~i i a :; i ii: Ii i._iji:ii.ii??ii i- [-' Ii i i , i i I: 'I j Li 11 I ; i : i: I I i ": ?~BF;~:~l:`.? 286 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995 FIGURE I I: Wood engraving after Hammatt Billings, The Colossus of Rhodes, from The Illustrated Pilgrim Almanac, 1860.</page><page sequence="10">?  i i? i= ?   ....i~i??

The Washington Monument took even longer to erect. Thinking about it began in the mid-1830s, but Robert Mills's 600-foot obelisk rising through a Greek Doric circular colon- nade was not accepted until 1845. The cornerstone was placed in 1848, but work ceased from lack of funds in 1856, and the monument was not finished until well after the Civil War.39 It was a controversial design from the moment of its publication, and was of a type Billings consciously sought to avoid for his Plymouth memorial. The Boston Transcript of 26 February 1850 published a letter opposing a federal grant-in-aid for the Washington Monument, which it called a national disgrace for the usual reason that it mixed incompatible styles (the eclecti- cism of the post-Civil War era was rarely condoned in the first half of the century). Hammatt Billings was among the many Boston architects, painters, and sculptors who signed the statement, so he must have been gratified when in December 1855 he received a letter from the architect Charles A. Alex- ander (1827-1888), another signatory who was then resident in Portland, Maine, praising his proposed monument for Plymouth, and urging that it be widely published so that the public might "see the contrast between it and the huge pile which is so likely to disgrace the country in the shape of the 'Washington National Monument.'" Alexander went on to praise Billings's project for its unity of architecture and sculp- ture, "too often lacking today." The fashion for erecting monuments had its detractors at mid-century (not, of course, among the Trustees of the Pilgrim Society), and the fashion for complicated allegorical monu- ments that had marked the late eighteenth century had waned by the middle of the nineteenth. Although there was no lack of precedent for colossal sculpture dedicated to national signifi- cance, all of the other proposals for the Plymouth memorial, from that of the Reverend Rufus Clark to those of the other competitors, were apparently mainly architectural, and the trustees, we remember, had questions about Asboth &amp; Zucker's use of allegorical embellishments on their design. There was in general some resistance in American monumental art of the mid-nineteenth century to what Thomas Crawford called, a year before Billings's proposal, "the darkness of allegory," an allegory that Horatio Greenough disparaged as a "puerile adhesion to an antiquated ... conception." Even George Hilliard, whose Third Primary Reader Billings was to illustrate a few years later, objected, also in 1853, to the "purely mental notion" that was allegory.40 We can now understand another reason for Winslow Warren's initial objection to Billings's proposal: it flew in the face of those contemporary prejudices. It was to be both architectural and sculptural, but it was largely allegorical, and it was huge. In 1848 the sculptor John Frazee objected to the Egyptian obelisk as emblematic of tyrant kings and unfit for memorials to republicanism and Christianity. He objected to Gothic style as I-----?_-;:_iiii: ,_; i i:~a-,i i.--:- :~; :--~-:i - ::---:::: ;:: a~i:-i-- :: .:- .:- .: . ................ .... . .: ; 1 : FIGURE 13: John A.

He used it elsewhere for both cemetery art and a public memorial: in 1858 for the 271-foot Cushman family monument of Quincy granite on Burying Hill in Plymouth, and in 1866 for the 49?-foot Soldiers' Monument of New Hamp- shire granite in Court House Square in Concord, Massachu- setts.42 For the Forefathers monument, however, he chose to create a colossal figure rather than a purely architectural composition. In this he was not alone, either in the United States or in the western world. Colossal figures have thrilled people from antiquity to the present.43 A rash of projected and executed examples, many dedicated to rising nationalism and reflecting the late eighteenth-century quest for the sublime, broke out in the early nineteenth century: John Flaxman's proposal of 1799 for a 230-foot Britannia for Greenwich, and L. Schwanthaler's considerably smaller bronze Bavaria (an 18-meter figure on a 9-meter pedestal) are examples.44 Billings published a view of the Bavaria in his Illustrated Pilgrim Almanac [Figure 14]. "Le grandiose, le sublime, tel est son partage," wrote Lesbazeilles of such works in the 1870s.45 Nor were all precedents European. In America there had been proposals for colossal figures, although in the majority these had not been allegorical designs but "portraits" of Washington or others. In the late eighteenth century the Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi suggested to Congress a monu- ment to American liberty in the form of an equestrian figure of Washington on a rock 100 feet high and surrounded by four ancillary allegorical figures.46 Among the alternate designs Robert Mills submitted for the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia in 1836-1840 was one proposing a 110-foot robed Washington atop a 100-foot cubical base.47 And in 1845 the team of Thomas G. Crawford, sculptor, and Frederick Catherwood, architect, proposed for the City of New York a cast iron, 75-foot Washington atop a 55-foot pedestal bearing Revolutionary scenes in relief [Figure 15].48 Although Washington was the subject of most of these colossal projects, he was not the focus of them all. One example was a proposal by Henry A. S. Dearborn (1783-1851), a Whig lawyer, congressman, author, and promoter of the Bunker Hill Monument as well as Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge and Forest Hills Cemetery in Roxbury-and thus conceivably known to Billings. In 1838 he suggested erecting at Buffalo on a massive granite pedestal a 100-foot bronze figure of New York governor De Witt Clinton (1769-1828) "holding aloft in one hand, a flambeau, as a beacon light, to designate ... the entrance, and pointing with the other, the direction of the route of the Erie Canal."49 No more came of this notion than came of Dearborn's later proposal for a 42-foot Corinthian column surmounted by a flaming urn to honor the memory of John Eliot, the seventeenth-century "Apostle to the Indians."so Bill- ings probably knew some of these or other prototypes; perhaps they quickened his desire to provide a colossal figure for the Forefathers monument. But he emphasized the allegorical in his design, and he also created his own sources. In addition to his other far-ranging activities, during the 1850s Billings was designing patriotic, multifigured, historical and allegorical illustrations for the periodical press. From 1851 to 1859 he drew more than sixty such compositions for ~.;?;- ---;??1????:?.?;?; ? ;???-;;:---~--::i;??-? ????:;?-;-?-i---?-:-? i??. i 'I?--:---- : I ; ; ;; ; - -- i: -?:i ;; ;-;- ; - ; ""- ';;;-;- : i s-- ?~ -;---- : . ; C '-;~ ; - - ; : :::: _- ;:I::::::'-:: . --ii::_--:i:::-:--;-:; --i:ii:-:-i::-:;-;;;;;;-:i:-i:;~i-:-;i-~ ;;:;:i;: ;::i?;i-i:-i:; i ...:; i-- :i::ji -------:-::;: ;-;':-----::---- ; -- ; -; ; ;; : -; --, i?i:::_i- -i:;_--i-:- ---:-iii: . iiiiiii -' ":"-'--" _ :.

She holds a raised wreath in one hand and a pike with liberty cap in the other, is "Americanized" by a feathered headdress (Cesare Ripa in his Iconologia, first published in 1593, depicted America with such a headdress), and stands on an arc within which is shown the U.S. Capitol with Thomas U. Walter's wings but not his dome. The wreath and the headdress were used again by Thomas Crawford for his Statue of Freedom, 1855-1858 (eventually placed atop Walter's new dome), although he added an eagle's head to the headdress and rejected the liberty cap at the insistence of Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of State.52 Resting on the haunches of the arc enclosing the Capitol in Billings's engraved allegory are seated females representing arts and sciences, figures which reappear some- what transformed on Billings's Pilgrim Society certificate of 1856 (see Fig. 7). Between them, in the Illustrated News, a putto sculpts a portrait bust of Michelangelo. In this composition, then, the dominant figure is a draped, upright female at the top of a triangle of figures: the two-dimensional equivalent of Billings's coeval free-standing colossal design. Billings's architectural projects of the late 1840s and early 1850s were largely Italianate in style. The portrait of Michelan- gelo in the Illustrated News, a reference that reminds us that Billings was to be called during his lifetime the Michelangelo of his day, may also point to a distant source (in time, place, and form) for the designer's composition here as in the Forefathers monument: the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici (1519-1534) in the New Sacristy at San Lorenzo in Florence.53 There, figures representing the times of the day lounge on the convex top of the sarcophagus, and seated figures of Lorenzo and Giuliano clad in military dress surmount the composition. Billings borrowed the triangular arrangement, the Giuliano for his Freedom (see Fig. 2), and the head-in-hand thinking posture of the Lorenzo for his original Law. (The comparison of such works, of course, points out that Billings was likened to Michelangelo for the range of his work, not the quality of his design.) In his dependence upon Michelangelo Billings seems to have led the way, as we shall see, but it should also be noted that he had sources of inspiration closer to home. His represen- tation of law, for example, could also have been suggested to him by Robert Ball Hughes's seated figure of Nathaniel Bowditch holding a book installed in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge in 1847. The plaster model for it stood (and still stands) in the entrance hall of the Boston Athenaeum, which Billings had remodeled in 1850. In 1857 he wrote that it was "the best statue of its kind in America."54 Billings's design dif- fered from all such sources, however, in its colossal dimensions. We first heard of Billings's "grand design" in Catharine Beecher's letter of March 1854, but he had in fact been thinking big in the realm of monumental art for the preceding year and more.

Throughout the next month the Boston Transcript discussed the idea of a public garden as the site for a Webster statue. On 13 January 1853, for example, the newspa- per proposed a colossal figure on an island in a pond in a place to be named Webster Park. And the next month, Gleason's, Boston's illustrated monthly, submitted its "plan of the Public Garden," having had "Mr. Billings sketch for us ... an artistic design ofwhat ... [it] should be.""56 At its center Billings proposed "to place a colossal statue of Daniel Webster, elevated upon a high pedestal, decorated at the angles with appropriate figures, and the faces ornamented with scenes in relief' [Figure 18]. Although the Tran- script for 24 March 1853 reported that there was thought of turning the sketch into a working plan, nothing came of either this colossal statue or Billings's Public Garden scheme in general.57 Nonetheless, and appropriately, as we shall see, Billings's projected "Webster" contained the Forefathers monu- ment in embryo. It seems to have been conceived as some 45 feet high. Although that was far short of his reach at Plymouth the next year, already present are the standing oratorical figure (the principal element also of Thomas Ball's full-length Webster, projected for the same occasion, and its rival, Hiram Powers's 8-foot bronze, now on the State House grounds), its octagonal base, the reliefs, and the supporting figures seated on the diagonal (one is in the posture of a thinker, but none, alas, is identified).58 When he heard, long before the public announce- ment, and probably through the Boston "old boy network," the financial and intellectual elite whom he served as designer, that the Pilgrim Society contemplated erecting a monument to the Forefathers, Billings had merely to enlarge this concept, and substitute the appropriate allegorical figures. "Webster" and Faith were not Billings's only designs in colossal statuary. At the end of the 1850s he joined as designer the sculptor Thomas Ball and the architect GridleyJ. F. Bryant, with both of whom he had collaborated and was to collaborate on other memorials, to design a monument to the battle of Lexington.5"" In the words of Edward Everett, who spoke in 1859 on behalf of the monument, it was to be the work of "Hammatt Billings, a distinguished native artist."

It was superseded by Daniel Chester French's popular, life-sized Minute Man, designed and put in place not in Lexington but in Concord, in 1871-1875.61 MEMORY SERVES The Webster, Forefathers, and Minute Man colossi, all con- ceived during the tremulous 1850s, show Hammatt Billings and his patrons attempting to focus not only on past heroic events but also on current political aspirations by designing monuments dedicated to the founding, creating, and sustain- ing of the national union. Of the three projects, "Webster" and "Minute Man" remain on paper; but, however shrunken and inelegantly executed, Billings's design for the National Monu- ment to the Forefathers now stands on Allerton Hill in Ply- mouth. What ideas did he think the monument should em- body, and, once they were chosen, how did he decide to represent them? Upon what did he base, and what was the context of, his iconography? The most likely place to find answers to such questions is in the patriotic speeches delivered at the annual celebrations of the landing and other commemorative occasions, especially those of the famed New England orators of the day, such as Daniel Webster (1782-1852) and Edward Everett (1794-1865), as well as somewhat lesser but nonetheless influential figures such as the Reverend Lyman Beecher (1775-1863) or the Boston lawyer Rufus Choate (1799-1859), who served with Billings on the board of directors of the Massachusetts Acad- emy of Fine Arts in 1853.62 A modern historian has pointed out that such oratory "stocked and restocked the common mind with a store of selected memories." It sought to create a "communal experience of affirmation.. .to create a state of consciousness: ... to make the abstract real."63 The Forefathers Monument was to do this in another medium, in effect to be a visualization of such oratory, a patriotic speech in historiated stone. Faith's gesture, we remember, was originally oratorical. The Lexington historian Charles Hudson wrote just after the Civil War that "thousands are actually moved by visible objects, who could scarcely be reached through any other medium; and ...the enlightened patriot who perceives the intellectual and the moral, will not despise the visible which strengthens his impressions, and concentrates all his powers upon the object of his contemplation.""' The Forefathers monument was to com- memorate the ideals of the Founders through allegory, not abstractly, as the Bunker Hill and Washington monuments memorialized the heroic deeds of the Revolutionary era. A growing national consciousness developed a form of ancestor worship in the first half of the nineteenth century that played off legends of the founding. Since the 1760s the anniversary of the landing had been marked by irregularly spaced celebrations at which prominent men delivered speeches expressing appropriate sentiments. If in our own day we find the intentions of the Pilgrims complex and not entirely benign or self-sacrificing, the mid-nineteenth century harbored no such doubts.65 In 1820, the year of the founding of the Pilgrim Society, Daniel Webster, in a celebrated address, instructed his audience that it stood "on the spot where the first scene of our history was laid; where the hearths and altars of New England were first placed; where Christianity, and civilization, and letters made their first lodgement, in a vast extent of country, covered with a wilderness and peopled by roving barbarians."66 And later, he exhorted his listeners not to forget "the religious character of our origin. Our fathers were brought hither by their high veneration for the Christian religion.... They sought to incorporate its principles with the elements of their society, and to diffuse its influence through all their institutions, civil, political, or literary." Faith, filiopietism, and a free social system: these were constituent elements in the mid-century use of the newly enhanced founding legend. And these would find visible expression appropriate to the era in the monument proposed for Allerton Hill. The celebration held thirty-three years later, in August 1853, in accordance with the resolution of the May meeting of the society as "a highly appropriate and fitting tribute to the memory of the Fathers of New England, and also a proper season for taking measures to erect a monument in the town, on or near Forefathers' Rock," featured a speech by Edward Everett.67 "There are two Master Ideas," he said, "by whose influence the settlement of New England may be rationally explained.. .[and] these Great Ideas are GOD and LIB- ERTY.... I mean profound religious faith.. .[and] civil lib- erty." The political code of the Pilgrims, he went on, "united religion and liberty, morals and law." Ifwe add education to this list we have in general the iconographical program of the National Monument to the Forefathers, designed in the year after this speech and dedicated three and a half decades later. Lyman Beecher, in a sermon delivered at Plymouth in December 1827, told his audience that "we are called upon... to cherish with high veneration and grateful recollections the memory of our Fathers.... While most nations trace their origin to barbarians, the foundations of our nation were laid by civilized men--by Christians .... 'THE MEMORY OF OUR FATHERS,' should be the watchword of liberty throughout the land .... Such models of moral excellence, such apostles of civil and religious liberty.. .constitute a censorship inferior only to the eye of God; - and to ridicule them is national suicide."68 The first sentence of Rufus Choate's address to the New England Society of New York in 1843 succinctly echoed this sentiment: "We meet again," he said, "the children of the Pilgrims, to remember our fathers."69 Billings must have been aware of the currently popular view O'GORMAN: COLOSSUS OF PLYMOUTH 291</page><page sequence="15">of the primacy of religion among the reasons for the Forefa- thers' departure from the Old World. "What sought they thus afar?" poetized Felicia Hemans in 1826: "They sought a faith's pure shrine!" To give shape to this cause the designer could have drawn upon a variety of sources. There was, of course, the Renaissance-Baroque iconographical tradition in which faith (Fede Cattolica) is presented (by Cesare Ripa, for example) as a draped female wearing a helmet and carrying, in her lowered left hand, the tablets of the Old and the book of the New Testament, and, in her raised right hand, a heart from which projects a lighted candle.70 Despite its Catholic origins, this icon, somewhat transformed to be sure, gained following in the nineteenth century even among Protestants. In another type, that represented by Antonio Canova's Religion of 1814 or Santo Varni's colossal Faith in Genoa of about 1850 [Figure 20], the draped female exhibits a radiating aura around her head, and she supports the upright Latin cross (Varni's figure carries a book, the Bible certainly, in her left hand). Billings learned of this tradition at some time in his career, for he drew a related figure of faith in 1870, probably as a design for a cemetery marker [Figure 21].71 The candle or other symbol of illumina- tion used in the iconographical tradition, however, gave way in Billings's Plymouth work to the oratorical gesture, the beckon- ing finger pointing heavenward. He rejected the helmet, as well as the aura of the second type, in favor of a single star, succinctly emblematic of the heavens, and he gathered the Old and New Testaments into one Bible. Billings eliminated some overt signs of religion, the cross and the aura, while retaining the Book, perhaps because he thought the former too Catholic for a monument to Protestant forebears. It is possible that Winslow Warren's dislike for the initial proposal stemmed in part from a Protestant mistrust of such popish representations of religion. Billings's representations of education, law, and morality are unexceptional: seated draped male or female figures holding a book or a tablet which, without his labels, could represent anything. His embodiment of freedom (later, liberty) as a seated male warrior, however, deserves comment. In contempo- rary illustrations, even in those by Billings himself, as in 1853 in the Illustrated News, for example (see Fig. 17), or in Ballou's for December 1855, Liberty is a classically draped female whose posture closely resembles that of the Faith of his monument (although the reasons for the posture differ). Billings here adopted the common type.72 As this figure represents faith on his monument, however, perhaps to avoid misreading or visual confusion, he picked a dramatically different representation of freedom. For formal prototype, as we have seen, he found inspiration in Michelangelo's armored figure of Giuliano de' Medici from San Lorenzo; this he adapted to an iconographical tradition for representing fortitude, or courage, to serve his purpose. His original intention, as we know from the model now in the Plymouth Public Library (see Fig. 9), unlike what was finally put in place on the finished monument (see Fig. 2), held no sword, but the attributes of his Freedom and many represen- tations of courage otherwise agree: helmet, armor, lion skin, and broken chain. In the iconographical tradition one represen- tation of courage is a warrior in the guise of Hercules draped in lion skin or subduing a lion.73 By adding the broken chain of slavery, Billings, with characteristic nineteenth-century insouci- FIGURE 20: Santo Varni, Faith, Staglieno Cem- etery, Genoa, c. 1850.   ~~~ ~~~~ 'iiIIiiiii~i!i!~!ii!!~ii~l !iiii~~~~iiii,,i'~~~ !!!'i :i ii i  i   !''

Each of Faith's ancillary figures in Billings's proposal was accompanied in turn by two supporting figures on the sides of the chair who amplify his or her message, and a relief depicting one of four remembered events in the story of the Pilgrims. History also occupied Billings's ceaseless pencil throughout the 1850s, and these narrative reliefs were extensions of his work for the engravers at Ballou's and elsewhere (see Fig. 16). They were also part of that nineteenth-century artistic "series of dramatic departures, landings, arrivals, and discoveries, [that were] symbolic touchstones of the nation's destiny, [and] im- plied that America itself was an apocalyptic revelation," as recently discussed by Wendy Greenhouse.76 Departure from Delft-Haven and Signing of the Compact Aboard the Mayflower were scenes specific to the Pilgrim story, while Landing of the Pilgrims and Treaty with the Indians were events shared with other immigrant groups. Billings's iconography combines tradition with some innovation. Early versions of his Compact and Landing are known from the engraved Pilgrim Society certificate of 1856 (see Fig. 7). For these compositions Billings relied (somewhat belatedly) on the neoclassical rules for narrative art, with figures arranged in a shallow space and balanced left, right, and center. In his Compact, associated on the existing monument with Education, the setting aboard the Mayflower is barely suggested. Male Pilgrims stand or sit around a carpeted table as one of them signs the document in what looks like a work descended from the portrait groups of Frans Hals, or, perhaps more likely, a composition dependent upon John Smibert's 1729 Bermuda Group, it too depicting an assembly of new arrivals, or one of its progeny in the work of Robert Feke or Charles Willson Peale.77 Landings of the Pilgrims and other groups had been treated more often in American art, so Billings could here draw upon a tradition both more varied and more specific.John Vanderlyn's large Landing of Columbus was in the United States Capitol rotunda by 1847. The event at Plymouth Rock appeared in Samuel Hill's engraving of about 1800, which formed the source for any number of painted versions, including that of Michele Fdice Cornm, and the same depiction is found, some- times augmented, sometimes not, among the illustrations in such popular publications as The History of the Pilgrims of 1831 or the United States Book of 1833.'78 By the time Billings turned his attention to the episode, the Pilgrim Society had in its own collection Henry Sargent's mammoth canvas of about 1813 [Figure 22]. Finally, Peter Rothermel's dramatic Landing of 1854 culminates the series.79 As historian Vivien Fryd has O'GORMAN: COLOSSUS OF PLYMOUTH 293</page><page sequence="17">written, these are scenes of passage, of the transformation of the Englishman into the American, as well as, in some depic- tions, the newcomers' "potential dominance over indigenous peoples."8o The transformation of the actors from seaborne Europeans to landed colonists is clearly depicted by Billings, whose Landing is linked to his Freedom, but the latent victim is nowhere to be seen as the men and women of the Mayflower gather to light the first fire of freedom. It was usual in depictions of the landing to give prominence to the Rock of legend, but Billings follows Sargent in down-playing it within his multifigured composition. (Somewhere along the line this relief was significantly changed to emphasize, in the more common version now on the monument, the passage from boat to Rock; see Fig. 3). Departure from Delft-Haven, which Billings placed beneath Morality, and Treaty with the Indians, associated with the figure of Law, round out the historical reliefs. The departure was prob- ably best known in the 1850s from the huge canvas of 1836-1843 by Robert W. Weir, in the United States Capitol rotunda, depicting the departing Pilgrims praying at Delft- Haven aboard the ill-fated Speedwell. Ashbel Steele used it as the frontispiece for his biography of William Brewster of 1857.81 Billings's design is independent of this tradi- tion. Assuming that what is on the monument now generally reflects his original composition, he concentrated on the trans- lation from land to ship, with some figures waving farewell, some grieving at departure, and others busy preparing the ship for sailing. Treating with the Indians was a more universal subject by the 1850s. Benjamin West's depiction of William Penn and the Delawares at Shackamaxon, of 1771, was prob- ably the best-known version, reappearing over and over again in copies, in framing prints, in popular publications, and in the abundant versions of The Peaceable Kingdom by the Quaker Edward Hicks.82 Another version carved by Nicholas Gevelot in 1827 appeared in sandstone in the United States Capitol.83 Billings's composition here too stands apart from tradition, if, again, we can assume that the present relief represents his design (see Fig. 4). The scene is usually set out of doors, but he correctly represents the negotiations of a Leo- nardesque grouping indoors, with onlookers, both Pilgrims and natives, standing around a table at which one of each of their number negotiates, probably Massasoit for the Indians and John Carter for the Pilgrims. And is that much- traveled Squanto who seems totranslate for the negotiants, and FIGURE 22: Interior of Pilgrim Hall, Plymouth, Massachusetts, circa 1875, showing Henry Sar- gent's Landing of the Pilgrims (ca. 181 3) and John Adams Jackson's model of Hammatt Billings's original project for the National Monument to the Forefathers ( 1854; see Fig. 9). ...... .......... . -;ii:2:_ !!i-:- pit i l r` 294 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="18">assumes a pose reminiscent of Christ at the center of Leonar- do's Last Supper? In showing the compact and the treaty as similar indoor scenes, Billings seems to link them, in the conception of his day, to suggest visually that the agreement among Europeans was akin to harmony between races. (We, of course, no longer see it that way.) He also composed both the departure and the landing as, appropriately, outdoor events memorializing the "sea change" that would make free Americans of persecuted Englishmen. The meanings of the historical reliefs on his monument were enhanced by these interactive commentaries. Hammatt Billings's National Monument to the Forefathers was thus intended at one level as historical text to be read according to mid-nineteenth-century interpretations of the past. The iconography spreads out from top to bottom, from the personification of the heaven-sent faith that was then believed to have fueled the Pilgrims' journey, to the social principles and civil institutions that were seen to have been established under her guidance, to the qualities these were either sustained by or fostered themselves, to the scenes of human history that accounted for the transference of those ideals to the New World. But at a second level the monument was intended to focus the United States of the 1850s on common national origins for current political ends. A complete reading of Billings's "text" must also take into account its historical present as well as the distant past. If the fervent filiopietism of the second quarter of the nineteenth century provided a patriotic context for the Na- tional Monument to the Forefathers, this context must be extended to include the onrush of events in the decade of the 1850s tending toward the dissolution of the nation, for that gives it even deeper meaning. As the historian Neil Harris has observed, "a society turns to an extended reliance on symbol- ism to prop up sentiments which require support." And he also notes that symbols "proclaim an allegiance to a cause ... or a creed in danger of being forgotten."84 The decade that saw the rising tide of secessionism, that witnessed, among many other well-known, sectionally divisive events, the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Bleeding Kansas in summer 1856, and John Brown's raid at Harper's Ferry in October 1859, also saw a cresting of interest in the arrival of the Pilgrims, an interest of which the proposed Forefathers monument was to be the most visible sign. Literary works devoted to the Pilgrims had appeared earlier, of course, ranging from Felicia Hemans's ten-stanza "Landing of the Pilgrims in New England" of 182685 to the children's History of the Pilgrims of 1831, but the number of serious works that appeared in the 1850s is astonishing. They include documents and guidebooks, histories, biographies, and fictional works. Among these are (to namejust one of each type from a long list) William S. Russell's Pilgrim Memorials of 1846 (second edition, 1855), E. H. Bartlett's The Pilgrim Fathers of 1853, Ashbel Steele's Chief of the Pilgrims ... The Life ... of William Brewster of 1857, Nathaniel B. Shurtleffs edition of the Records ofthe Colony of New Plymouth, 1857-1861, and Henry Wadsworth Longfel- low's "Courtship of Miles Standish," begun in 1857 and first published in 1858. And it should also be noted that William Bradford's OfPlymouth Plantation first appeared in its entirety in 1856. Although these were regionally focused, their reach was wide. Most students of the period agree that, in the succinct statement of the art historian Angela Miller, "in the 1850s the Northeast laid claim to being the privileged carrier of national identity."86 Modem historians such as Wesley Frank Craven and Lawrence Buell have discussed the uses of history in the middle of the nineteenth century. Craven points out, for example, in The Legend of the Founding Fathers,87 that New England writers had a "special influence on the development of our national historical tradition," and that histories of New England de- picted it to be the story "of a God-fearing community dedicated to the fulfillment of a religious ideal" that was also a political ideal: the right of self government. It was a reading of history that created a common tradition, and Craven goes on to remind us that "one function of tradition is to provide a focus for the sentiment that binds men together in hours of trial. ... The past and future are cherished together in a way that reminds us of our national inclinations to make of the past a guarantor of the future."" 88 This was, we remember, exactly Billings's choice of arguments in defense of his proposal to Winslow Warren. Legends of the founding, in particular of the landing at Plymouth, provided the stuff of national tradition, of common memory. And it was to that national tradition that Billings and his patrons looked in creating the monument to remind all citizens, North and South, of their collective heritage during the trying 1850s. His aim, it seems, was not only to give shape to the words of the great orators of his day, but to those of the historians as well, in the cause of preserving national unity for the progeny of his time through the celebration of a shared heroic origin. In a time in which national principles were forgotten, "art was a means of coping with the problem," again according to Neil Harris.89 He quotes William Hoppin, who in 1846 wrote that monuments render the "idea of country in a visible shape .... We need something tangible. .... We need the outward types." This appears to have been Billings's intention: to enlist the colossal tradition to celebrate a collective memory in the service of current events. Billings's mentors for the meaning of the monument, men such as Webster, Everett, and Choate, were all stout Whigs and Unionists, men who believed disunion would be worse than slavery, who-much to the disgust of more dedicated abolition- ists-compromised in the hope of saving the integrity of the O'GORMAN: COLOSSUS OF PLYMOUTH 295</page><page sequence="19">civilization of the Founders. Among the letters apparently solicited by Billings after his proposal had been accepted by the Pilgrim Society was one from Josiah Quincy (1772-1864) endorsing the design as embracing "everything, piety, patrio- tism &amp; veneration could desire.""' A second letter, from Edward Everett himself, tied the inspiration of the past to the fears of the present in a succinct statement of the monument's meaning. "Its colossal dimensions symbolize the magnitude of the event &amp; the moral grandeur of the characters commemo- rated," he wrote, continuing: The erection of such a work on the scale proposed, implying as it does the co-operation of the descendants of the pilgrims in every part of the Country and of all who are now in the enjoyment of the goodly heritage for which ... we are so largely indebted to the Pilgrim Fathers, is well calculated to promote fraternal feeling throughout the Union, and deserves the encouragement of every patriot.91 And Everett's interpretations were echoed from across the Mason-Dixon Line in a letter from Henry A. Wise (1806-1876), governor of Virginia and a pre-war Unionist who, in the wake of John Brown's raid, joined the secession and fought for the South. He wrote from Richmond on 2 January 1856: "Well may we all unite, the sons of the Cavaliers with their [the Pilgrims'] true sons [i.e., New Englanders], in building a monument founded upon these four corners of perpetuity [morality, education, law, and liberty] &amp; pointing to Heaven for immortality." THE DIMINISHED RESULT The gathering gale of disunification was stronger than these verbal and visual sermons of unity, however, and would soon fan the nation into a firestorm of belligerent divisiveness. And that would of necessity delay and transform the realization, as it swept away some of the meaning, of Hammatt Billings's "great design." The diminished result was anticlimatic. Cornerstones for the canopy over the Rock and for the Forefathers Monument were laid on the same day, 2 August 1859, with President James Buchanan and the designer in attendance.92 The canopy was finished in 1867 [Figure 23].93 Despite the provision given in the contract, where four figures of bronze are particularly mentioned (a design for which no drawings or other descriptions seem to survive), Billings's canopy was without anthropomorphic embellishment. It took the form of an arcuated granite baldacchino of Baroque form but Tuscan simplicity with four scallop shells, the medieval symbols of pilgrimage adopted at Plymouth for her Pilgrims, dotting the skyline.4 The use of the baldacchino form and the shell motifs may have contributed to the downfall of this structure (which was destroyed in 1919 to make way for the present pavilion, sponsored by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America). It quickly evoked criticism. As early as 1882 Herbert Adams called it "pretentious," and a "mausoleum," lamented that it "overshadows the Rock itself," and noted-in an allusion demonstrating shaky art history but firm conviction-that it "reminds the beholder of the canopy over the altar of St. Peter's." And that was certainly the wrong FIGURE 23: Hammatt Billings, canopy over Ply- mouth Rock, Plymouth, Massachusetts, 1854- 1867, destroyed 1919. ; ;-~-;~_-: :: . ::--~~i;':,~~l~~~-:-~---- ::i:~r : - :: F~~k~~~i~~: -i::-- is ---. :: :-_:::C~7~-~~~~ :?:;I:_:::::::; . i~i-~ii --_-i~, ?-;i~~-i-- ' .-ii?: ~-~i-i- ?._-;ia--i?-.;:i-_: _--i~-:iii! ~~~~851e gl 296 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="20">::I:- - - - .- i g.ra : - - : : p : ? : : : i :i-? : :: - : :?

He hoped for its removal, a sentiment that grew into the Colonial Dames' "improvement" at the time of the tercentenary.95 The canopy was dedicated just after the Civil War, but the collection of funds for the monument, with premium statuettes cast in 1867, continued to lag behind expectations. Just before his death in November 1874, Billings, perhaps on the theory that halfa monument is better than none, and more likely to be realized so long after the fervor of its original proposal, significantly cut it in size, and a contract was signed for the construction of the pedestalwith the Bodwell Granite Company ofVinalhaven, Maine. It was finished in 1875, when Hammatt's surviving brother and partner, Joseph E. Billings, assumed the duties of supervisor. Oliver Ames of North Easton, Massachusetts, donated Faith, O'GORMAN: COLOSSUS OF PLYMOUTH 297</page><page sequence="21">which was carved at the Hallowell Granite Company in Maine. But the figure was no longer, as originally intended, the product of small gifts from across the nation, nor was it completely Hammatt's creation. Early in 1875 Joseph asked the sculptor William Rimmer (1816-1879), with whom Ham- matt had studied anatomy in 1864, to make a nine-foot model after his brother's design to be used as a guide to the full-scale figure. (There is no explanation why Jackson's earlier model was no longer adequate, unless that is somehow explained by the change in size.) Differences of opinion arose between the two because Rimmer altered the figure, changing her raised arm to the present crooked one, for example, thus losing the oratorical reference, and freeing her upraised thumb in an awkward gesture, despite keeping one eye on the Venus de Milo while he worked [Figure 24].96 Nor was Rimmer the only sculptor to intervene. One Edward Perry reworked Rimmer's model atJoseph's request, and at the Hallowell yard the figure was carved by an employee, Joseph Archie, who, although he kept one of Hammatt's early engraved views hanging from the scaffold, apparently made further changes [Figure 25].97 The result, put on the pedestal in August 1877, was a composite work representing six different minds and hands: those of Hammatt Billings, Jackson, Rimmer, Joseph Billings, Perry, and Archie. The result was severely criticized when it was new, and it has not improved with age.98 Morality was set up the next year. She was the gift of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was modeled by German- born Carl H. Conrads (b. 1839), who also signed the relief of the embarkation beneath it. In 1873 Hammatt had made definitive drawings for the reliefs, and apparently asked the young Daniel Chester French to model them.99 Although French appears to have made some small sketches (which do not seem to have survived), apparently nothing came of that initiative. Education was next, the work of Alexander Doyle (1857-1922) of New York following Billings's design, with its relief of the Mayflower Compact (slightly altered from Billings's original), modeled by English-born John M. Moffitt (1837-1887). Roland Mather of Hartford paid for them; they were put in place in October 1881.Joseph had died in 1880, as had Willard Harding, who had been Hammatt's financial agent from the beginning, and another long hiatus ensued. Freedom (changed from Hammatt's Liberty), the gift of Congress, and Law, paid for by subscription, with their reliefs, were modeled by Welsh-born J. H. Mahoney (1855-1919), an employee at Hallowell, and put in place in the autumn of 1888. (As we have seen, the relief of the landing is significantly different from the original composition.) The finished conglomerate was dedi- cated on 1 August 1889, long after the original design had lost much of its meaning. In the period between then and now it has slowly become a largely forgotten relic of an imperfectly remembered past. Hammatt Billings's colossal vision of national unity based on a shared reverence for the founding legend, as delayed, reduced, and transformed, is only partly realized in the existing monument above Plymouth Harbor. It was dedicated three years after the unveiling ofAuguste Bartholdi's Liberty Enlighten- ing the World in New York.00oo Its plodding presence and its provincial location have relegated it to obscurity, while Liberty, a lively figure of contemporary "high-tech" engineering situated by the Golden Door, the principal late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century gateway into the United States, has become globally symbolic of the nation. Billings's Faith represents the dated beliefs of one religious group; Bartholdi's Liberty still embodies the hopes of many displaced peoples. The granite of the Forefathers monument is emblematic of its traditional regionalism; the ironwork of Liberty, emblematic of her modem internationalism. The undoubted relative importance of the two colossi as realized has, however, like the relationship between their dedicatory dates, clouded the relationship be- tween their inceptions. Billings's colossal vision of 1854 was well known across the country after 1855 through engravings and small replicas, and it ought now to be understood as a meaningful antecedent to Bartholdi's statue, which was con- ceived in 1865. Billings's struggle to solicit monies for its erection from the entire country, while it proved only partly successful because of the turmoil of the 1850s and the disrup- tion of the Civil War, clearly anticipated similar fundraising efforts on behalf of Liberty [Figure 26; see also Figure 7]. As lugubrious as the executed monument now seems, as neglected as it has now become, Billings's original design should assume iiiiiiii .. i. .. i- /- / ?

These are consistent with each other, but not in all particulars with the statue or the (later) version in the Illustrated Magazine. The drapery clasp centered at Faith's throat is, however, common to all except the magazine version, where it is placed asymmetrically above her left breast. It is the latter version that appears in The Illustrated Pilgrim Memorial of 1866. 31sThe last quote comes from a description given by Billings himself, published in Russell, Pilgrim Memorials (see n. 6), 193-5.

The present Boston Garden was planned in 1860 by Boston architect George F. Meacham, for whom Billings occasionally ghosted designs. 58 Thomas Ball, My Three Score Years and Ten (Boston, 1892), 141-2; Wayne Craven, Sculpture in America (Newark, Del., 1984), 221; and Sylvia E. Crane, White Silence: Greenough, Powers, and Crawford (Coral Gables, Fla., 1972), 244-50. 59 Billings provided the base for Ball's Washington in the Public Garden in 1867. He frequently collaborated with Bryant. Immediately after the Civil War, for example, the partnership produced a project for a 120-foot soldiers' and sailors' monument for Flagstaff Hill on the Boston Common. A 20-foot female figure of Liberty atop a tall column, it proved to be too expensive, and Martin Milmore designed the existing monument in 1870: O'Gorman, "H. and J. E. Billings" (see n. 17), 54-72; Peggy McDowell, "Martin Milmore's Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument,"Journal ofAmerican Culture 11 (1988): 63-86, and GridleyJ. F. Bryant and Hammatt Billings, Architects, Specifications ofStone-Cutter's Materi- als &amp; Works for Memorial Monument (Boston, [1866]). There are unpublished drawings for reduced versions of the monument by Billings, dated early 1870, at folios 30, 52, and [54] of the large N. T. Bartlett scrapbook in the Fine Arts Department of the Boston Public Library. 60 Charles Hudson, History ofthe Town ofLexington (Boston, 1868), 218-9. By the time this history was published, the hope of actually erecting the monument was effectively dead. Thomas Ball (Three Score [see n. 58], 215-6) wrote that a small model was paid for and a contract drawn up for a 15-foot figure (far short of that envisioned in Billings's view of the monument on the engraved certificate), but that the project foundered at the Civil War. 61 Michael Richman, Daniel Chester French (Washington, D.C., 1976), 39-47. 62 Massachusetts Academy, Catalogue (see n. 22). 63Jean V. Matthews, Rufus Choate: The Law and Civic Virtue (Philadelphia, 1980), 48-9. 64 Hudson, Lexington (see n. 60), 216. Hudson was writing of the erection of the first Lexington Monument in the late eighteenth century, but his words might also refer to Billings's proposal of half a century later. 65 See Arthur Quinn, A New World: An Epic of Colonial America from the Founding offamestown to the Fall of Quebec (Boston, 1994), 80-116, for example. 66 Edward Everett, ed., The Works of Daniel Webster, 4th ed.

I doubt that Billings thought in such terms. 75 Bo Wennberg, French and Scandinavian Sculpture in the Nineteenth Century 300 JSAH / 54:3, SEPTEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="24">(Stockholm, 1978), 166-7, and H.

William Ayres (New York, 1993), 45-63. 77In a later revision of the Compact scene, for the title page of his Illustrated Pilgrim Almanac (1860), Billings kept the general format but varied the position and character of the attending crowd, and added in the lower left a mother contemplating an infant in a cradle and at the right a young boy. The relief on the existing monument more closely follows the earlier version. 78Carl L. Crossman and Charles R.

But Quincy is also bothered by the potential cost, and he reminds Billings of the histories of the Bunker Hill and Washington monuments. The architect had designed a house for the Quincys in Wollaston, Massachusetts, in 1848. 91 The original, which I quote, is dated 21 November 1855. It was published in American Congregational Year-Book 6 (New York, 1859), iii, with other letters linking the past with the present and the future. 92 Illustrated Pilgrim Memorial (Boston, 1864), 32-39, and Proceedings (see n. 2), 12-16. 93 See, among other references, Architects'and Mechanics'Journal 1 (1859): 11. Thanks to MichaelJ. Lewis for bringing this to my attention. 94 At the evening ball after Daniel Webster's stirring speech in 1820 (see n. 71), a scallop shell was hung around his neck. This, according to Gomes (Pilgrim Society [see n. 5], 8), was the first use of this medieval emblem in relation to the American Pilgrims. The shells survive as landscape ornaments on Allerton Hill (see Fig. 1). 95Herbert B. Adams, "Plymouth Rock Restored," Magazine of American History 8 (1882): 46. 96 A scrapbook at the Countway Library of the Harvard University Medical School contains sketches by Billings and others after blackboard drawings by Rimmer made during February and March 1864.

Bartlett, The Art Life of William Rimmer (Boston, 1882), 87, and Jeffrey Weidman, "William Rimmer: Critical Catalogue Raisonne," Ph.D. diss.; Indiana University, 1982, 1: 382-6. The plaster figure seems not to have survived. 97 See the stereocard published in William C. Darrah, The World of Stereo- graphs (Gettysburg Pa., 1977), 189 (fig. 293). 98 T. H.

In 1983 Barbara A. Murek, then an assistant editor for the National Trust of the papers of Daniel Chester French in the Library of Congress, wrote to me of Billings's correspondence with French regarding these reliefs, but Sarah Allaback has been unable recently to locate such letters.
