Melvin The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ABSTRACT Two series of impacts to the head in the superior-inferior direction using 19 unembalmed cadavers are reported • The first series of five tests was aimed at generating kinematic and dynamic response to sub-injurious impacts for the purpose of defining the mechanical charac- teristics of the undamaged head-neck- spine sys- tem in the S-I direction. The second series of fourteen tests was intended to define injury tolerance levels for a selected subject con- figuration. A 10-kg impactor was used to deliver the impact to the crown at a nominal velocity of 8 m/s for the first series, and between 7 and 11 m/s for the second series. Measurements made in the first series include the impact velocity, force, and energy, the head three-dimensional kinematics, forces and moments at the occipital condyles, and accelerations of the TI, T6, and T12 vertebrae. Impact impedance curves were also generated. Measurements made during the second series were the same as the first, except that no condyle reactions were calculated nor detailed autopsies were performed. Peak impact force was not found to be a reliable predictor of cervical injury. Further- more, since such injury often occurred without skull fractures indicating that the neck may be more vulnerable to S-I impacts than the head it- self, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) would not be useful to determine the effectiveness of head protective devices in protecting the neck. On the other hand, both the time integral of the force and the maximum head velocity correlated well with cervical spine damage and thus they may be useful in predicting neck injury. EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH ON AXIAL IMPACT to the head has been generally aimed at two goals. The first is to describe the kinematic and dynamic impact response of the head-neck- spine system for the purpose of designing humanlike mechani- cal surrogates, and the second is to understand the mechanisms of cervical spine injuries resulting from accidents in the automotive, in- dustrial, and athletic environments, such as car rollovers, falling objects, and swimming pool diving accidents. Culver et al. [l]1 conducted head axial impact studies on eleven unembalmed cadavers using a 10-kg padded impactor. Most of the fractures produced were of the posterior ver- tebral elements, with peak forces of 4.7 to 8.9 kN and impact energies of 260 to 645 J. Using a 56-kg impactor, Nusholtz et al. [2] conducted twelve cadaver tests to investigate the factors affecting cervical spine damage in axial im- pacts. In that study, study, the impact velocity was 4.6 to 5.6 m/s, and the generated forces were 1.8 to 11.1 kN. The reported damage to the cervical spine included fractures to the spinous and transverse processes, laminae, and vertebral bodies as well as ruptures of the dis- cs and tears of the ligaments. In a study of axial impact to the head when it is protected by a football helmet, Hodgson et al. [3] concluded that head freedom to rotate about the atlanto-occipital junction, location of impact, and alignment of impact force with the spine were influential factors on injury site and level. In other studies [4-7], the mechanical strength and properties of individual vertebrae and of segments of the spine and in- jury to the spine were investigated. This paper summarizes the findings of two series of head axial impact studies that were carried out between 1979 and 1981 at the Univer- sity of Michigan Transportation Research In- stitute. The objective of the first series of 5 cadaver tests was to generate kinematic and dynamic response data for sub-injurious impacts in order to describe the mechanical characteris- tics of the undamaged head-neck- spine system in the S-I direction and to design a helmet impact test device that is human-like in its S-I response [8]. The second series of 14 tests was conducted in order to determine head-neck 1Numbers in brackets designate references at the end of the paper. 6.927 0096-736X/85/9306-0927$02.50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">6-928 N.

DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTS SUBJECT SELECTION - Unembalmed cadavers provide reasonably good surrogates to live humans. Since their mechanical properties vary with age, size, time after death, integrity and condition of the skeletal structure, and medical history, every effort was made to keep the variability of these factors to a minimum by carefully selecting (or rejecting) an available subject. The subjects selected for testing in the two series were all male and are described in Table 1. Prior to each test, the subject was weighed and X-rayed to ensure the integrity of the head, cervical spine, and upper thorax. The head was instrumented with the UMTRI 9- accelerometer array, and triaxial accelerometer clusters were installed on TI, T12, and, in some tests, on T6 thoracic vertebrae. The surgical and instrumentation procedures used in these tests are described in detail in [2] and [10]. TABLE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF TEST SUBJECTS Subject Head Dimensions (cm) Test No. Wt. Ht. Lth. Wth.

High speed movies were taken in a three-dimensional calibrated field, and, in the first series of tests, 35-mm high speed X-ray movies of the cervical spine were also taken during the impact. All tests were conducted with the subject placed either prone or supine on four layers of 10-cm seating foam atop an ad- justable table. This soft cushion allowed for a relatively free motion of the cervical spine, with the head suspended with breakaway paper tapes, so that the initial and significant por- tion of the impact occurred when the head was aligned with the spine. The initial position and alignment of the head and spinal column were adjusted to simulate the natural curvatures of the upper spine during normal seating or standing postures. In some tests, attempts were made to align the cervical and thoracic spines as closely as possible along the axis of impact. This was done to confirm the suspected effects of the initial alignment on the resulting injuries. In all cases, in- place lateral X-rays were used to document the initial angles, with respect to the horizontal, of the head anatomical posterior-anterior axis, and of the neck using the tangent to its mid- portion as a reference line. The convention used in defining these alignment angles is described in references [2] and [10], and the measured angles are given in Table 2, which also gives the test conditions.

The impact velocity for the remainder of the tests was varied between 7 m/s and 11 m/s in an attempt to determine the tolerance level of the head-spine system. In most of the tests, the impactor was padded with 5-cm thick ensolite foam in order to control the duration of the im- pact force pulse and to minimize local skull fractures.</page><page sequence="3">AXIAL IMPACTS 6.929 POST-TEST PROCEDURES - While no detailed autopsies were performed after the first five tests, the subjects were examined to confirm that no bone fractures were produced. A gross autopsy was performed on the head and neck of subjects in the second series. The scalp was reflected and the calvarium removed for examina- tion. The epidural and subdural areas of the brain were inspected, the brain and dura were extracted, and the base of the skull was ex- amined. All observed injuries were recorded and classified. Following the autopsy, the occipi- tal condyles were marked with lead pellets, and a 3-D X-ray procedure was followed to determine the location of the two occipital condyles with respect to the anatomical reference frame. This information is necessary for computation of the reaction forces and moments at the condyles. DATA ANALYSIS METHODS IMPACT SEVERITY - This was characterized by the velocity of the impactor, the peak and dura- tion of the contact force, the impulse, and the energy of the impactor at the instant of impact. The velocity was accurately measured from pulses generated magnetically by the moving impactor. All other parameters were calculated from the force-time history. The contact-force duration was defined as the time interval between the beginning and end of the pulse. These two points were obtained by fitting straight lines to the rise and fall por- tions of the pulse and locating their intersec- tions with the x-axis. The impulse was obtained by integrating the force time-history. Finally, the transferred energy was defined as half the ratio of the square of the impulse over the im- pactor mass. HEAD KINEMATICS - The description of the impact response of the human head requires that the kinematic quantities measured experimentally be described in reference frames which vary from one instrumentation method to another. One method for comparing mechanical responses be- tween subjects is to refer all results to a "standard" anatomical frame which may be easily identified. However, it may be impractical to require that transducers be aligned with this anatomical frame. An alternative is to mount transducers in an arbitrary and convenient reference frame and then describe the transfor- mation necessary to convert the data from this instrumentation frame to a desired anatomical one. A three-dimensional X-ray technique is used to accomplish this for head impacts. Four anatomical landmarks (two superior edges of the auditory meati and two infraorbital notches) are marked with four mutually distinguishable lead pellets. The nine-accelerometer plate is marked with lead pellets at the center of mass of each triaxial accelerometer cluster and also at the plate center of mass. The head containing this instrumentation is then radiographed in two or- thogonal directions (the x-z and y-z planes). On each of the two radiographs the optical center and the laboratory vertical z-axis are simultaneously X-rayed. The subsequent computa- tions reconstruct the laboratory coordinates of each of the lead targets. The Frankfort plane is determined and the anatomical reference frame is reconstructed from the four anatomical points. The instrumentation frame and its origin are determined from the three triaxial accelerometer centers. Finally, the transforma- tion matrix between the instrumentation frame and the anatomical frame is obtained. The head kinematics are then computed from the 9 ac- celeration signals and expressed in the anatomi- cal reference frame. The UMTRI 9-accelerometer method for computing the 3-D head motion has been fully documented in [11] and [12] and will not be described here. HEAD DYNAMICS - In order to compute the reaction forces and moments at the occipital condyles, the location of the condyles, the head center of mass, and the head kinematics (ac- celeration of the anatomical center, angular ac- celeration and velocity vectors) must all be determined in the anatomical reference frame. In addition, the mass and the moment of in- ertia matrix of the head must be estimated from anthropometric measurements. The location of the condyles was determined with a 3-D X-ray procedure similar to the one described above. The head center of mass was assumed to be in the midsagittal plane at 1.3 cm forward of and 2.1 cm above the anatomical origin [13]. Measure- ments of six cadaver heads by Chandler et al. [14] and a study by Lett et al. [15] were used as a basis for developing regression models to estimate the mass and moments of inertia matrix from 4 anthropometric measurements: head length, breadth, height, and circumference. The principal inertia ellipsoid was assumed to be pitched 49.6 degrees with respect to the anatomical forward axis. The external forces applied to the head, assumed to balance the known inertial forces, include the six unknown reactions at the con- dyles (3 forces and 3 moments), as well as the contact forces applied to the top of the head. Since the head rotates under impact, the force signal is broken into 3 components along the anatomical moving reference frame. The 3 ac- celerations at the center of mass and the 6 unknown reactions are finally computed. IMPACT IMPEDANCE - Classical impedance is defined as the ratio of magnitude of force over velocity, when the system has reached steady state under sinusoidal excitation. Impact im- pedance may be defined similarly except that those magnitudes are defined as the Fourier coefficients of the transient force and velocity signals. This is a useful characterization in impact testing of subjects, since it is imprac- tical to repeat the application of impact until a steady state is reached without destroying the system being measured. Impact impedance curves were generated to describe the overall transfer function between the top of the head and the head anatomical center, TI, T6, and T12 thoracic vertebrae in the S-I direction.</page><page sequence="4">6.930 N. M. ALEN, ET AL. RESULTS The results of autopsies are summarized in Table 3. Since the impact level in the first five tests was intentionally designed to produce no injuries, none were found. However, no in- juries were produced in tests H401, H405, H411, and H414 either. Skull fractures only were produced in tests H409, in which no padding was used, and in H413, in which the padding was only 0.5 cm thick. The impact severity parameters associated with the force signals are given in Table 4. Head kinematic response is given in Table 5, while spinal acceleration response is given in Table 6. The computations of neck loads and mo- ments at the condyles was performed only on the first five tests. These reactions are sum- marized in Table 7, and were based on the es- timates of head inertial properties given in Table 8. Typical response time-histories are shown in Figure 1 for head linear and angular motion, Figure 2 for T1 and T12 accelerations, and in Figure 3 for the forces and moments of the condyles. Typical impact impedance curves are shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6 for the head, Tl, and T12, respectively. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS SKULL INJURIES - In looking for impact con- ditions that produce skull injuries under the impactor, one finds that localized fractures can occur for impacts in the R-L and A-P direction [13,15] vhen there is no padding to distribute the impact force and reduce local stress. Similar injuries are produced in impacts in the S-I direction when no padding is used, as in test H409. When a thin pad of 0.5-cm ensolite was added to the impactor surface while maintaining approximately the same velocity and producing approximately the same peak impact force, local skull fracture was avoided, but a basal skull fracture was produced in test H413. A similar type of injury was produced in test H200, in which the impact velocity was 12 m/s and impac- tor surface padding was 2.5-cm ensolite. Be- cause test H200 was a trial run, it was not in- strumented and thus no further analysis could be performed. Although exact knowledge of the mechanisms of basal skull fracture cannot be directly ob- served, two mechanisms may be postulated on the basis of the system morphology. The first mechanism suggests that the neck reactive forces are transmitted to the relatively thin skull floor through the occipital condyles and the relatively strong ring opening of the foramen magnum, causing a basal skull ring fracture. The second mechanism is the initiation of a crack in the skull (due to excessive bending and stressing of the cranial shell), at a location removed from the skull base itself, that propagates toward the skull base and precipitates the basal skull fracture in ques- tion.

No head 3-D analysis was done. and the cervical spine was aligned along the line of action of the impact force. In the remaining tests (H401 through H414), an in- position X-ray was used to align as well as pos- sible the "general spinal axis." The underlying assumption for this type of initial positioning is that, if the force level is high enough to exceed the strength of the skull floor near the foremen magnum, and the force is sufficiently distributed so as to avoid a local depressed fracture on the crown of the head, then direct loading of the condyles by the neck could cause the skull base to fracture. Despite these ef- forts, no skull fracture occurred. The injuries observed were fractures of the vertebral bodies and processes in the cervical and upper thoracic spine, and increased force only resulted in more severe spinal damage. In the pilot S-I impact study [1] and in several tests in this study, attempts were made to orient the impact line of action along the spinal column. In tests H405 and H406, the im- pact velocity was nominally 8 m/s, the impactor surface padding was 5-cm ensolite, and the cer- vical spine was aligned approximately along the impactor axis. The peak forces in these tests were about 4 kN. While the padding and impactor velocity remained the same, tests H401 and H404 had a significantly different alignment of the cervical spine, but the peak forces produced remained at the same 4 kN level. This indicates that the angle formed between the axis of the cervical spine and the axis of the impactor for a supine test subject may not significantly af- fect peak force. However, the angle does profoundly affect both the impact force-time waveform and the head acceleration time history. Although, in general, for a supine test subject the cervical spinal angle does not af- fect peak force, it has been suggested [2] that peak force may be increased by a combination of cervical and thoracic spinal angles which com- TABLE 6 - PEAK SPINAL RESPONSE Acceleration (G) Velocity (m/s) Test No. T1 T6 T12 T1 T6 T12 H201 68 - 31 2.1 - 2.7 H202 226 - 119 3.4 - 8.7 H203 60 - 111 2.4 - 2.1 H204 96 - 32 2.2 - 2.1 H205 78 - 30 2.7 - 2.1 H401 49 44 22 1.6 2.7 1.3 H403 130 91 27 2.4 3.0 1.6 H404 180 64 24 3.5 3.5 1.3 H405 46 41 12 1.7 2.0 1.0 H406 70 54 15 2.4 2.5 1.0 H408 59 88 20 2.2 1.7 1.1 H410 48 17 7 H411 12 15 7</page><page sequence="6">6.932 N.

The second mechanism of basal skull frac- ture, in which deformation in the skull causes stress distal to the point of impact, has been discussed by Gurdjian [16]. He postulates that, as long as the cranial skull remains intact under the impact, the shell undergoes an inbend- ing under the impacted surface as well as an outbending away from the impacted region. It is at the outermost point of the bent cranial shell that a crack is initiated due to tension. The crack then propagates downward toward the foramen magnum around which the skull base is weakest, and a basal skull fracture is precipitated. The tests in which basal skull fracture oc- curred were characterized by large forces of short duration. This type of force-time history is significantly different from the force-time history of the rest of the tests in this study. The implication is that, although skull deforma- tion may be a necessary condition for basal skull fracture, it may not be the sole cause in S-I impacts. CERVICAL INJURIES - In order for the forces to reach levels sufficient to cause the above- mentioned skull deformation, padding on the im- pactor surface must be of sufficient depth to eliminate local skull fracture but not great enough to spread the transfer of energy from the 10-kg impactor to the skull over an extended time interval. When local or basal skull frac- tures occurred, neck injures were absent as in tests H200, H409, and H413. From this observation it would seem that, if the available energy of the impactor is small enough not to overdrive the system, then, to produce damage to the neck, the skull must remain intact throughout the impact. The im- plication is that when the skull remains intact the initial curvature of the neck allows it to "buckle" under the load from the condyles, which results in extension or hyper extension motion of the neck. Injuries to one or more cervical vertebrae occurred virtually in all the other tests where the neck "buckled" under the impact load. The common feature of these tests is that there was TABLE 8 - ESTIMATES OF HEAD PARAMETERS Moments of Inertia, (kg.m2) Test Mass No. (kg) lxx Iyy Izz H201 4.23 0.0234 0.0228 0.0245 H202 3.85 0.0162 0.0188 0.0169 H203 3.32 0.0124 0.0145 0.0134 H204 3.64 0.0156 0.0174 0.0163 H205 4.64 0.0246 0.0274 0.0253 H401 3.91 0.0163 0.0208 0.0173 H402 3.96 0.0184 0.0224 0.0192 H403 3.11 0.0114 0.0142 0.0126 H404 4.05 0.0168 0.0168 0.0164 H405 4.14 0.0201 0.0216 0.0212 H406 3.85 0.0162 0.0172 0.0167 H407 2.81 0.0086 0.0110 0.0095 H408 3.99 0.0186 0.0215 0.0195 H410 4.32 0.0208 0.0226 0.0217 H411 3.11 0.0138 0.0158 0.0145 H412 4.44 0.0211 0.0237 0.0218 no attempt at aligning the neck with the spine and impactor axes. Instead, an initial curva- ture of the neck was allowed to simulate the natural attitude of normally standing or sitting persons. Some observations could be made about the impact parameters and kinematic responses of these tests. In tests H402 and H403, fractures to the lower cervical vertebrae were caused. Both tests had peak forces of about 11 kN, an impactor velocity of 10.9 m/s, and a padding of 5 cm thickness. In the other tests (H404, H406, H407 , H408, H410, and H412), the force level dropped to 4 to 5 kN. Yet injury was produced under a variety of impact conditions, including different paddings and different head/neck angles. Most of the injuries occurred in C3-C4, i.e., in the region of maximum neck bending with occasional damage done to the C1/C2 area or to the T1/T2 thoracic region. Based on the tests in this study, it is clear that injuries to the cervical spine are occurring at impact force levels much lower than those required to produce skull fractures. NON-INJURIOUS IMPACTS - Four impact tests conducted in this research project did not produce any damage to the neck or the head. These were tests H401, H405, H411, and H414. It might seem reasonable to draw a line between im- pact levels and kinematic parameters observed in these four tests and those observed in the remaining tests and call that line a threshold of tolerance. However, a closer look at these parameters reveals certain inconsistencies. Based on tests H401, H405, and H411, a peak force level of about 4 kN seems at first glance to be just below the tolerance level of the neck. An exception is the level of 3 kN in test H412 where injury did occur. Another exception</page><page sequence="7">AXIAL IMPACTS 6.933 at the upper end of the force spectrum is test H414 where no injury occurred even for a force level of 16 kN, while identical test conditions and parameters produced a basal skull fracture in test H413. IMPACT PARAMETERS AS INJURY PREDICTORS - Table 4 includes such impact force parameters as peak, duration and impulse, and the energy of impact that is absorbed by the head, as deter- mined from conservation of momentum principles. By comparing these parameters to the results of autopsies, one should arrive at the critical value of some of the parameters previously men- tioned below at which no injury should occur. The data produced in this study indicates that none of the parameters chosen as predictors of injury consistently results in an infallible criterion. For example, based on three non- injurious impacts, it seems that a peak force of 4.2 kN is about the maximum that could be tolerated without injury. Two exceptions are test H414, where no injury occurred even when force reached a peak of 16 kN, and test H412, where injury was observed at a much lower peak force of 3 kN. Because these tests had different force pulse durations, it was thought that a parameter that accounts for both duration and peak force may be more appropriate as an injury predictive measure. Thus the impulse defined as the in- tegral of the force-time history, was calcu- lated. Another related parameter that was com- puted was the impact energy transferred to the head. Of the two parameters, the impulse offers less inconsistency in predicting non-injury than energy. RESPONSE PARAMETERS AS INJURY PREDICTORS - The two potential tolerance criteria discussed above (peak force and impulse) define tolerable levels of impact in the S-I direction. Tolerable levels of kinematic response of the head and neck, derived from kinematic measure- ments may also be defined. Two other kinematic responses were con- sidered as predictors of injury. The first is the peak head linear acceleration, and the other is the peak head linear velocity. These two parameters can easily be monitored in anthropomorphic devices. Of the two measures, the velocity offers a better predictive power than the acceleration, because it takes into ac- count the duration of the impact. However, the number of tests available for determining a velocity threshold level is too small for that purpose. CONCLUSIONS 1. Padding is essential in distributing the im- pact force and eliminating localized skull fracture. 2. Load-distributing materials are effective methods of reducing localized skull frac- tures, but they do not necessarily eliminate skull fractures in general. 3. The use of Head Injury Criterion (HIC) is not recommended for predicting the injury potential of S-I head impacts. 4. Of the response parameters that were ex- amined, head velocity seems the best suitable indicator for injury. Of the response parameters that were not examined, the neck gross motions (either deflection or angle) may offer the greatest potential for accurate injury prediction. 5. Of the impact parameters that were examined, the integral of the force-time curve, i.e., the impulse, seems to be the most consistent injury indicator. 6. The size of the sample of tests available for determining S-I tolerance levels remains too small for accurate assessment. This sample must be enlarged by conducting more S-I head impacts, and by widening the scope of experimental documentation to focus on measurement of the neck motion.
