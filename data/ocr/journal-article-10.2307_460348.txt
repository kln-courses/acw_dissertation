<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHELANGELO AS A BAROQUE POET By Robert J. Clements MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI'S in? fiuence upon baroque sculpture is now widely recognised by historians. Ever since that morning in 1506 when he and the Sangalli, father and son, watched the white Pentelic marble of the Laokoon emerge from the farmland of Felice de Freddis near the Baths of Titus, Michel- angelo's restless mind found authority in antiq? uity for a revision of his aesthetic canons. In this agonising group Michelangelo found justi- fication for moving beyond the symmetry, re- straint, and proportione divina of the Donatellian mode of sculpture, the static scientism of Da Vinci's painting, and the Vitruvian rules of architecture?even though he paid lip service to those rules and even recited them to popes. Whereas Michelangelo did not acknowledge this infiuence in writing, or apparently in speaking, his contorted and anguished Haman (1511-12) on the spandrel of the Sistine Vault was an admission of the infiuence of this Rhodian group ?just as El Greco's newly-restored Laokoon in Washington acknowledges it as the one work of art which initiated European baroque. More? over, the anguishes of the Vatican Laokoon and the expressions thereof were to parallel those tensions?visible even in his death mask?of Michelangelo's own soul and to leave an imprint upon his poetry. Laokoon, it should be remem? bered in view of his impact upon European baro? que, was a militant, ritualistic priest. The assessment of the baroque values in Michelangelo's painting and sculpture?and in the drawings, where almost every figure reveals Michelangelo's addiction to the serpentine line and accentuated contrapposto?has been under- taken by various studies recorded in the Stein- mann-Wittkower bibliography.1 Many of the catch-phrases of the historians of aesthetics find immediate application in Michelangelo's art. The vision lejana of Ortega or the "emancipation from the earth" of Eugenio d'Ors describing the celestial plane of baroque representation finds magnificent articulation in the histories of the Sistine Ceiling ("la . . . fra i rari e demidei"),2 or in the Giudizio universale. Indeed, to some observers this latter piece of "pessimistic art" initiates the baroque period in painting.3 The Sistine "loft" antedates such conspicuous ba? roque "faraway visions" as Andrea Pozzi's vault in Saint Ignatius, Rome, or the shining heavenly visions of El Greco, Tintoretto, Murillo, the Carracci, and other artists of the Counter- Reformation. The uncertainties and polarities of the human spirit appear as clearly on the face of Michelangelo's figure // Sogno as they do on the perplexed visage of that other baroque dreamer for whom life is illusion, shadow, fiction, and dream: Segismundo in Calderon's La vida es sueno. The violent martyrdom and metamor- phosis of Michelangelo's flayed St. Bartholomew exceeds in cathartic horror the sufferings of St. Matthew, St. Sebastian, St. Ursula, or other holy men and women portrayed by the baroque Span? ish painters at the urging of Juan Vives and the Church. It would not be difficult to find further exam? ples in Michelangelo's art of elements identi- fiable as baroque, whether baroque in form, con? tent, or expression. It is a more challenging task to establish the baroque character of his out- pouring of sonnets, madrigals, canzoni, stanze, and fragments {non finiti, as in his art). Two authors have dedicated monographs to Michel- angelo's poetry without undertaking this par? ticular task.4 Tentative suggestions have been voiced, however, that Michelangelo's poetry was at least partially baroque.5 The first problem to be faced is that baroque is above all else a spirit which transcends individual genres, and sec- ondly, a grouping of characteristics which may be valid for one art form but not transferable to another. The radiant or ruddy gleams which transfuse or highlight a baroque canvas may be adapted to poetry, but not to sculpture, where the lighting is (as Michelangelo told Cellini) "il lume della piazza."6 The puns which are a para- 1 Ernst Steinmann and Rudolf Wittkower, Michelangelo Bibliographie (Leipzig, 1927). In discussing the difference be? tween the Pietd in Saint Peter's and the Deposition of the Florentine Duomo Charles Morgan declares "The one group may be called the climax of the Early Renaissance, the other an introduction to the Baroque, a period which Michelangelo before all others forced into being."

Clements 183 doxical device of literary baroque are hard to achieve in painting, even though Michelangelo will pun with his Cumaean Sibyl, holding her book at arm's length to show that she is "far- sighted." Even sculpture will have its own ba? roque elements (contrasts of planesand recessions, for example) which poetry and music would find it hard to duplicate. In measuring the baroque spirit and charac? teristics of Michelangelo's Rime, this paper will be limited, then, to elements which may or may not be transposable to his works of figurative art. When a transposition is useful to the under? standing or enrichment of a poem, it will be established. Slowly, after the pioneering of Wolfnin, more and more unanimity has been achieved in the definition of baroque style, language, or expression. Dominant character? istics will be selected from among those proposed, not without controversy, by Weisbach, Praz, Wellek, Hatzfeld, Raymond, Rousset, Odette de Morgues, Friedrich, Buffum, and Warren.7 How? ever, before dealing with the commonly accepted elements of baroque, I shall seek to establish that Michelangelo exemplified the spirit, as well as the letter, of baroque. The baroque nature of Michelangelo's Rime resulted from the historical moment of the com? position of the bulk of the verses, that is, during the latter half of the nine decades of his life (1475-1564). It resulted, further, from the in? tensely mystical nature of the man, particularly as he aged. It derived from his increasing un- certainty about the values he had adopted for his life and his career?an increasing and ego- shattering awareness of life's instability and ir- reality. Finally, it represented the sum of stylistic devices recognised as typical of baroque expres? sion, some of these abundantly present in Michel? angelo's poetry. It becomes, therefore, the aim of these pages to show that Michelangelo's verse is baroque be? cause it is Counter-Reformational, because it is mystical and confessional, because it is riddled with doubt, contradiction, and desengano, and lastly, because it utilises modes of expression now generally conceded to be typical of this religious and aesthetic movement. I Baroque has been viewed, especially since Werner Weisbach's Der Barock als Kunst der Gegenreformation, as an outgrowth of Counter- Reformational feeling. It is symptomatic that Ignatius Loyola, who launched the counter- movement, hailed in Michelangelo the kindred spirit to undertake construction of his mother- church, the Gesu, often cited as a model of baroque architecture after its completion by Vignola and Giovanni della Porta. Loyola's exul- tation over Michelangelo's offer, expressed in a circular letter (1554) to members of the Order, is a tribute not only to Michelangelo's stature as superintendent of the fabbrica in St. Peter's, but also to his Counter-Reformational spiritual for- mation. This spirit informs his late poems just as it affected his choice of artistic themes, chan- neling his energies entirely to Christian subjects (with the single exception of the bust of Brutus, nevertheless involved in Michelangelo's mind in a curious equation: Brutus: Caesar = Judas: Christ)8 once he had settled in Rome. Even though his poetry had not begun to circulate in print, it was known to such inrluential people as Giorgio Vasari, Donato Giannotti, Vittoria Colonna, and Luigi del Riccio, who quoted it around the Holy City less formally than it was being introduced to Florence by the pedantic academician Benedetto Varchi. Several of the key issues disputed by Protes- tants and Catholics are treated in the Rime. The Counter-Reformational line is upheld through? out. On the issue of grace and the elect, Michel? angelo hoped ardently that he was to be one of the chosen. The entire Giudizio universale, echo- ing the plea of Thomas of Celano in the Dies Irae, is a personal appeal for grace paralleling the many similar pleas during the last period of the Rime. Grace "rains," but varies according to the worth and readiness of the recipient (cxx). Michelangelo's concern over grace was often ex? pressed during his late years, at the nones and vespers of his life ("Ma nona e vespro, e prossima la sera"). In one of his most disturbed sonnets, "Vorrei uoler, Signior, quel ch' io non uoglio," the old poet begs for grace and, fearing his own inadequacy, wonders how he may be so blessed: ne so be', onde Apra l'uscio alla gratia, che s'infonde Nel cor, che scacci ogni spietato orgoglio. (cxl) His piece "Per qual mordace lima" (lxxxvii) works up to a final plea: "Lord, in the final hours, stretch out to me thy merciful arms, take me from myself, and make of me someone thou 7 Still most useful is Rene Wellek, "The Concept of Ba? roque in Literary Scholarship," Journal of Aesthetics, v (1946), pp. 77-109, with its full bibliography. 8 Michelangelo's interest in Brutus and the parallels with Judas are recorded in Donato Giannotti, Dialoghi de' giorni che Dante consumd nel cercare VInferno e '/ Purgatorio (Flor? ence, 1939).</page><page sequence="3">184 Michelangelo as a Baroque Poet mayest care for!" In sonnet cli the old man who has striven so hard to keep the faith pleads for grace: De porgi, Signor mio, quella catena Che secho annoda ogni celeste dono: La fede, dico, a che mi stringho e sprono Ne, mie colpa, n* 6 gratia intiera e piena. The effort to be worthy of grace must be con- stant and unbending: "Nel cor, ch'e piu capace, piu s'appiglia" (cxx). Grace is more difficult to obtain for one who lives on into old age, when the demands of ascetic Christianity are harder to meet: "Non gioua senza gratia l'esser uechio," he wrote (cxxii). This belief that one endangers salvation by longevity troubled this artist who lived to almost his ninetieth year. Tristo m'e, c* a trouar grati' e mercede Negl* ultim' anni a molte colpe e raro. (clvi) This belief proved a consolation, however, when the three babies of his nephew Lionardo died, for the great-uncle knew that these infants as? sumed to a state of grace in their original inno? cence, and not original sin, as Calvin would have had it. This "gift of heaven" reappears in Michel? angelo's love poetry and "rains" from the divine Vittoria Colonna (cix, 82). It was also in the context of a love poem that he expressed his desire to "ascender uiuo fra gli spirti electi / Per gratia tal c' ogni altra par men buona" (cxli). Rare indeed is the word "elect" in his writings, but it is sometimes found?even if his belief in predestination was not Reformational, but Pla? tonic. Indeed, he believed that man had a free will ("sciolto uoler"), and that only man's sin- ning could deprive him of it (xxv). Michelangelo sided with the Counter-Refor- mation on the mass. We have several references in letters and elsewhere to his attendance at mass, the last mention just preceding his death, when F. Miniato Pitti told Vasari in a letter (10 October 1563) of meeting Michelangelo at mass. There is no reference to mass in the poems, how? ever, nor to the selling of indulgences. Papini went so far as to theorise that Michelangelo's genius was the initial cause for the Reformation, since the Tomb of Julius II, entrusted to the artist, required huge sums of money and the consequent intensified sale of indulgences which spurred Luther to his schism.9 In general, the poetry complements Michel? angelo's letters and quoted statements in which he condemns apostasy, upholds orthodoxy, and has little use for the critics of the Church, within and without. On the three grounds of authority, orthodoxy, and decency he will not stray from the Church's position. His scorn for Calvinists, Lutherans, and Zwinglians is revealed by his comment that heretical monks had "guasto il mondo." Indeed, at the very bottom of the Giudizio universale lurks a monk held by many to be Luther. Michelangelo could criticise popes as men but not as successors to Peter. He could write a sonnet (iii) chiding Julius II for being a fallible patron and a "withered tree" (see be? low), but he will never question the infallibility of a pope as Vicar of Christ. Savonarola's treat? ment by Alexander VI, it is true, brought him to the verge of such condemnation. Papini claimed that Michelangelo was unorthodox in his belief that man was redeemed through Christ's blood, yet this article will suggest that his pre- occupation with Christ's blood in the Rime was not schismatic, but an emphasis shared in com? mon with many baroque mystics. On grounds of decency, only one poem hinges on oflensive language and imagery (the capitolo: "lo sto rinchiuso come la midolla") with its clinical and cloacal details. The other 342 poems and frag? ments are as inoffensive as the Venetian Inquisi- tioners held his Last Judgement to be, even when those censors were indicting Veronese for paint? ing soldiers and dogs in the Feast at the House of Simon. Most of Michelangelo's deeply religious and Counter-Reformational convictions shine through the poetry. His belief in the efficacy of prayer is exemplified by his poetic orison, set down in his own handwriting and reproduced by Guasti.10 His poems expressing fears about his own un- worthiness illustrate his belief, expressed else- where to his friend Francisco de Hollanda (and probably heard much earlier from the lips of Savonarola), that only the most worthy artists deserve to paint church images.11 On the matter of images and iconolatry, Michelangelo in prac- tice and even by implication in one poem (xxxvii) believed in art's function as Biblia laicorum. Even though he never sculptured a Crucifixion, he composed a powerful sonnet to the Redeemer rising from the Cross: "Non fur men lieti che turbati e tristi" (clx). The baroque structure of this piece is pointed out by Ceriello: "Con la potente fantasia che intui la terribilita tragica del Giudizio universale, Michelangelo in questo sonetto svolge il mistero della Redenzione.

Clements 185 uno scenario a tre piani sovrapposti, inferno, terra, e cielo giganteggia su tutto Cristo risorto e liberatore dell'uomo dal primo peccato."12 Ob? viously, Michelangelo disapproved of the Protes? tant rejection of Purgatory, first established graphically by his idol Dante ("Che uisto ebbe l'inferno giusto e '1 pio") (cix, 37). Michelangelo's belief in confession stands revealed by the "mia colpa's" of his poetry, even though his confiteors do not require priestly intercession. He did not spurn the saints in heaven, as did the Protes- tants, and they are mentioned in a general way in his poetry ("Che 'n ciel non nuoce l'esser men beato") (cix, 96). None is pointed out individ- ually, like his sculptured Matthew or his painted Bartholomew. His alleged self-portraits, inci- dentally, are of saintly men?Bartholomew, Nicodemus, Proculus, and John the Baptist. His attitudes on other issues disputed between Northern and Southern Christians are known to us from other sources than his Rime: free exami? nation, miracles, relics, and the rest. Finally, the artist's belief in the efficacy of penance is only too clear from these poems. Michelangelo's bulwark of belief concerning Church and theological matters was then that professed by the majority of baroque writers. If there was an occasional baroque poet among the Protestant schismatics (D'Aubigne, Du Bartas, Milton), baroque was so essentially a Catholic canon that Crashaw, son of an Anglican minister, went to live and work in Rome, as had Michel? angelo himself, and Johann SchefBer likewise be? came converted. II Granted that the greatest baroque poets were Catholics who made of poetry a vehicle for the propagation of the faith, these poets were more? over mystics who spoke directly to God, Christ, or the Virgin, or even the martyred saints. Michel? angelo, who could make of verse a kind of anxious prayer, imprecation, or monologue to God or the Saviour, belongs firmly in their ranks. Like Saint Teresa, Crashaw, Southwell, Quevedo in his ascetic phase, and Marguerite de Navarre of the Prisons, the artist made of his Rime an increas- ingly mystic and anguished outpouring. Some? times the Signore he addresses is God, sometimes the baroque Christ whose blood purges mankind. The blood which drips from the Christ of Velas- quez and more baroque Crucifixions in Spain and Italy is not overlooked in Michelangelo's poetry: I parlo a te, Signior, c' ogni mie pruoua Fuor del tuo sangue non fa Puom beato: (cxlii) Po* che non fusti del tuo sangue auaro, Che sara di tal dono la tuo cremenza, Se '1 ciel non s'apre a noj con altre chiaue? (cli) Tuo sangue sol mie colpe laui e tochi E piu abondi, quant* i' son piu uechio (clii) Del ciel di terra a Puom col sangue apristi (cix) Signior mio car, tu sol che uesti e spogli E col tuo sangue Palme purghi e sani (clxv) Ma pur par nel tuo sangue si comprenda (clvi) As occurs with other baroque imagery in these poems, this image of blood-sacrifice is mirrored in the verses on prof ane love: "And pound by pound she draws the blood from my fibers and veins" (cix, 77). Mystic poetry is above all an expression of the amor bueno, love of God. This God of love and charity may be seen in the upper lof ts of baroque paintings in anthropomorphic majesty, like the benign God of El Greco's Baptism of Christ. Michelangelo incarnates God in this way on the Creations of the Sistine Ceiling. To Michelangelo the arm of God creates and the arm of Christ judges. He is almost as concerned with the arms of Christ as with Christ's blood. As a mystic he longs, as did Dante, for those arms: Signior, nelP ore streme, Stendi uer me le tuo pietose braccia (lxxxvii) Ch'aperse a prender 'n croce le braccia (cxlvii) whose possible gesture of rejection, like that of the Christus Judex of the Last Judgement fills his soul with foreboding: Non mirin con iustitia i tuo* sant' ochi II mio passato, e '1 gastigato orechio Non tenda a quello il tuo braccio seuero. (clii) Even that curious practice of the male mystics, calling themselves brides of God, is found in Michelangelo's troubled sonnet in which he calls upon God to brush away the veil of ice which separates the heats of their love?a fine baroque conceit: Manda '1 predicto lume, a noi uenturo, Alla tuo bella sposa, accio ch' io arda (cxl) The whole question of the expression of mysti? cal love in Michelangelo's Rime is complicated by the fact that he was in addition a Petrarchist and Platonist. Petrarchism in his poems parallels and even apes their religiosity, as the reader will observe. Platonism in his poetry vacillates be? tween serving Michelangelo's God and the men 12 Ceriello edition of the Rime (Milan, Rizzoli, 1954), p. 276.</page><page sequence="5">186 Michelangelo as a Baroque Poet he loved (or that spiritual companion, Vittoria Colonna, "un uomo in una donna," as he called her). The preponderance of Michelangelo's love poems being to men, he would seem to illustrate Constandse's theory that antifeminism and homosexuality were baroque traits. Michel? angelo is martyrised by Christian anguish in "Penso e ben so ch'alcuna colpa preme" and by earthly love in his madrigal, "Se '1 volto di ch' io parlo, di costei." Love in the poems will be now sacred, now profane. The torments of Petrarchan love mirror, but are not confused with, the erotic ecstasy of the mystic longing to be joined to God. And one must sometimes read well into a poem before understanding whether the Signore addressed is God or one of those men on whom Michelangelo bestowed affection: Febo di Poggio, Gherardo Perini, or Tommaso Cava- lieri. Even as we identify the baroque elements in the religious verse of Michelangelo, we find them paralleled in the stanzas of love. Take, for example, the traditional image of the Flaming Heart, originating with a vision of Teresa of Avila and concretised by Bernini's Saint Teresa in Ecstasy, in Santa Maria della Vittoria. This image, rightly viewed by Mario Praz and Austin Warren as the epitome of baroque conceits, be? comes a commonplace in Michelangelo's verse (cix, 12, 40, 54, 58, and passim). His heart flames in his mystical poetry: Ch'ancor che arde e arso e gia molt' anni (cix, 33) and is kindled by profane love: Io non posso pensar come '1 cor m'ardi (xxxvi) The image, found in other baroque poets, of a flood of tears putting out the flames in the heart reappears in the Rime (cix, 47 and 74). The legitimate concepts and vocabulary of baroque (suffering, uncertainty, desengano, ec? stasy, contrast, metamorphosis, imbalance) have spilled over into love poems where they become mere Petrarchistic devices. Even martyrdom, as we have suggested: Michelangelo's eagerness for self-immolation: "Ne dal martir mi crollo, / Anz' ognior temo, non (mi) uenga meno" (cix, 54) is addressed to a woman to whom he offers his flaming heart, and not to God. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that these conceits were restored by Michelangelo to the Petrarchan love poetry whence they evidently originated. Indeed, I have sometimes felt that if any one man were the capostipile of European baroque, it was Petrarch. Michelangelo's familiarity with Pe- trarch's canzoniere, of which we have so many evidences, guided his steps, then, along the path to baroque. Perhaps no passage in literature was so seminal for the development of baroque love poetry, mystical as well as earthly, as Reason's definition of love in Petrarch's dialogue De remediis utriusque fortunae (i. 49): "Bene ais: uror. Est enim amor latens ignis, gratus vulnus, sapidum venenum, dulcis amaritudo, delectabilis morbus, iucundum supplicium, blanda mors." These words, so important a legacy to the ba? roque and metaphysical poets, fond of paradox, oxymora, and metaphorical antithesis, find echoes in many of them, including Quevedo. Since the mystic longs to be rejoined to God, the enforced stay on this earth becomes intoler- able. Saint Teresa cried "muero porque no muero." Life on earth becomes a sentence in prison. Fray Luis looks up to the "innumerable lights" adorning heaven, his heart aflame and his eyes a fountain, and commiserates with his soul: "Que desventura la tiene en esta carcel baja, escura?" In his sonnet, "Como de entre mis manos te resbalas," Quevedo laments that every instant of life in this earthly duress is a "new execution." On several occasions Michel? angelo assents that life is a prison from which he awaits deliverance: Che del career terreno Felice sie '1 depor suo grieue salma (cix, 103) In che career quaggiu l'anima uiue (lxxiii, 19) Per ritornar la donde uenne fora L'inmortal forma al tuo career terreno (cix, 105) The prayer in Michelangelo's writing attributed to him by Guasti is a mystical appeal for such release: "Donami gratia, che tutto quanto il tempo che io staro in questa carcere, inimica de l'anima mia, nella quale tu solo mi tieni, che io ti laudi."13 This longing to return soon to God is expressed in the Rime in a variety of ways: Ch' i' porto inuidia a' morti (lxxxvii) Ch' io son disfatto, s' i' non muoio presto (lxxxi) Sometimes the death of a loved one intensifies this desire for death. After the demise of his assistant Urbino, for example, he wrote to Vasari (Letter cdlxxvii) : "In dying he taught me how to die, not with displeasure, but with desire for death." Even when he wrote to his departed father, old Lodovico, he admitted: Tu se' del morir morto e facto diuo (lviii) Ne tem' or piu cangiar uita ne uoglia, Che quasi senza inuidia non lo scriuo. 18 See note 10 above.</page><page sequence="6">Robert 7. Clements 187 To the deceased Vittoria Colonna, he anticipates: "death and grief that I long for and seek" (xcix). To his perplexed query why death will not come sooner, he adds his resentment in a verse with two oxymora: Crudel pietate e spietata mercede Me lascio uiuo . . . A Christian longing for death may well con- vince himself that death is near. This motif in Michelangelo's verse finds curious expression. He is "eating on credit at the hostel of death" (lxxxi), for example. He is "already numbered among the dead" (cix, 87), "weary and near his last word" (cxv). Che con la morte apresso Perdo '1 presente, e 1' auuenir m'e tolto. (cix, 59) Giunto e gia '1 corso della uita mia (cxlvii) Quant' ognior fugge il giorno, che mi resta, (cix, 58) Del uiuer corto e poco Death continues to haunt his poetry. He is "so close to death and so far from God" (xlviii). He must "repent, make ready, and take counsel with himself with death near" (xlix). He feels death "right now" (cix, 28). He has reached his "final hours" (cix, 34 and 81). His very birth was al? ready toying with death (cxxii). Suddenly the glimpse of his white head reminds him that he "has already in hand the plow of the other life" (cxxii). Death is so near, but still the decline of his body is slow (cix, 83). Yet this imminence of death was more imagined than real?as early as 1507 he speaks in a madrigal (xi) of his forth- coming death ("propinqua morte"), when he was to die in 1564, fifty-seven years later! One of the common themes of the baroque mystics is the nothingness of the body in which the soul is imprisoned. The instability of human life is nowhere better illustrated than by the threat of the "double death" (body and soul) which hangs over us, a death of body and soul from which the worthy among us will, however, be spared through God's encompassing love: "A la terra la terra e l'alma al cielo" (lxxiii, 37). Man will rise from this body like a phoenix soar- ing forth from its own ashes: Ne Punica fenice si riprende, Se non prim' arsa; ond' io, s'ardendo moro Spero piu chiar resurger tra coloro Che morte achresce e '1 tempo non oflende. (cix, 87) The notion of a Christian phoenix is behind Michelangelo's other references to the body as cenere (cix, 92). Michelangelo's image of the body as a leather pelt was not a mere conceit. As in the case of the mystic poets, it was a pro- found belief and it comes back again and again in his poetry. His awareness of the increasing debility of his own body obsessed him and he complains in letters and poems of some nine maladies, including blindness, deafness, gall- stones, dizziness, and others. His awareness that he was shrinking away toward death captive with? in his pelt had its most graphic culmination in his portrait of himself as the dried carcass of Saint Bartholomew in the Giudizio universale. However, graphic wording in his Rime shows a great variety of pejorative words to describe his body. The following sampling of verses will give an adequate idea: Dinanzi mi s'allunga la chorteccia (ix) Or che '1 tempo la scorza cangia e muda, La morte e l'alma insieme ognior fan pruoue (xlix) Non posso altra figura immaginarmi 0 di nud' ombra o di terrestre spoglia (lxiii) L'anima, della carne ancor uestita (lxiv) Man's body is little more than that dried epi- dermis of the serpent which is rubbed against rock and so dissolved: Cosi uolesse al mio signor mio fato Uestir sua uiua di mia morte spoglia, Che, come serpe al sasso si discioglia Pur per morte potria cangiar mio stato. 0 fussi sol la mia irsuta pelle, Che del suo pel contesta, da tal gonna, Che con uentura stringe si bei seno, Ch' i' arei pure il giorno. Even that most beautiful of adolescents, Cec- chino de' Bracci, is clothed in nothing more than "la carne terra" (lxxiii, 19). Elsewhere (lxxiii, 21) Michelangelo has the youth cry out in death that man is but a withered tree (a favorite image of our poet) and that "uom morto non resurge a primauera!" The image of death as a withering is repeated in lxxxii, 81: "Fallen is the fruit and dry already is the husk." The poet as prisoner of his encompassing flesh is comically described in the capitolo lxxxi already referred to: I' sto rinchiuso come la midolla Da la suo scorza, qua pouer' et solo, Come spirto legat' in un' ampollo. The soul is imprisoned in the body much as the art form is hidden within the mass of marble: Per l'alma, che pur trema, Cela il superchio della propria carne (lxxxiv) Col inculta sua cruda e dura scorza</page><page sequence="7">188 Michelangelo as a Baroque Poet Per qual mordace lima Discrescie e manca ognior tuo stanca spoglia, (Ixxxvii) Anima inferma? Other references to the body as withered fill the poetry. Obsessed by the thought of the Last Judgement as he was, Michelangelo could not forget that on the Day of Wrath God would re- clothe these souls: "Se l'alma al fin ritorna / Nella suo dolce e desiata spoglia" (cix, 96). Michel? angelo returns to this "baroque theme"14 several times in his poetry (lxxiii, 8, note; lxxiii, 49). As a final evidence of Michelangelo's mystical attachment to Christ, when he seeks to charge that Rome after Alexander VI violates the teach- ings of Jesus, he adopts baroque expression to accuse Rome of "selling the pelt" of Christ and "vending the blood of Christ by the bueket- ful" (x). III One of the inherent functions of baroque poetry or art is to express the unstable, tentative, contradictory nature of life. Life is irreality, transition, paradox, even desengano, "y los sue- fios sueiios son." Nothing in life is to be taken for granted. Values are difficult to establish. "... II vero non surge fora," complains Michel? angelo (clvii) to his God. More specifically, "What used to be festival and sport to me is now death" (cxliii). Even Michelangelo's dedication to the fine arts, which led him to the highest artistic post offered by Christendom, may have con- sumed time better spent on other pursuits and brought him to desengano, disenchantment. An- titheses find no easy synthesis in the baroque mind, even if the word "baroque" itself came out of mediaeval syllogistic logic. It is symptomatic that no fewer than forty-six of Michelangelo's poems begin with se (if), stressing uncertainty, hypothesis, or mutability of condition. This astonishing statistic does not include incipits within the body of poems, of which there are great numbers (iii, x, xxvi, and passim). Indeed, "S' un casto amor, s'una pieta superna" (xliv) contains ten se conditions. Even verses which should be outright affirmations come veiled as grammatical concessions: Se '1 foco il sasso rompe e '1 ferro squaglia (cxxxii) Se qui son chiusi i begli ochj e sepoltj (lxxiii, 1) Se dalla morte e uinta la natura (lxxiii, 10) Se il mio rozzo martello i duri sassi (ci) This same note of mutability and the ephem- eral is attested by twenty-seven poems which begin with negatives. The uncertainty is not only implicit, but sometimes explicit: "Ne so," "non so," and the like. The vacillating character of the baroque poet caught between contrasting polarities leaves him in a moral dilemma or even aboulia: Fra '1 uitio e la uirtute II cor confuso mi trauaglia e stanca (cix, 97) In due parti mi tiene Confusa . . . (cix, 69-70) Che fia di me? Qual guida e quale scorta Fie che con teco mai mi gioui o uaglia (lxxxix) S' appresso m'ardi e nel partir m'uccidi? La mia allegrezza e la maninconia (lxxxi) Sometimes his will is left subjected to the slight- est tip of the scales: . . . un si e no mi muoue (Ixxv) Che poss' io piu? Che debb' io? . . . (cx) The uncertainties of love are akin to those of mystic passion in that the poet is caught "be? tween two perils, whence I sleep and am wake- ful" (cix, 83). Love and cruelty create a dilemma in him: L'un s'arma di pieta, l'altro di morte; Questa n' ancide e Paltra tien in uita. (cix, 1) Serua mie liberta, mortal mie diuo A me s'e facto. O infelice stato! (xxv) The baroque mentality viewed suffering and pain as an erotic-ecstatic experience, memorably phrased in Crashaw's "delicious Wounds." The divine or profane loves of Michelangelo thus motivate the following paradoxical thoughts: 0 cosa strana, Se '1 mal del foco spesso il foco sana. (xxxvi) Tanto piu chi m'uccide mi difende (xlii) Crescier la uita, doue crescie '1 male (lxi) E piu mi gioua doue piu mi nuoce (xlii) Tanto piu nuoce quanto piu dilecta (clviii) Ch' ognor m'ancide mi difende e scampa (cix, 25; also cix, 26) A common device of the baroque poet is the paradox which transcends sense and logic. There are several isolated verses exploiting this device, including one of Michelangelo's early pieces, un- usual in combining three such lines: 14 So called by Odette de Mourgues, Metaphysical, Baroque and Prtcieux Poetry (Oxford, 1953), p. 85, where other baroque treatments of the theme are discussed.</page><page sequence="8">Robert J. Clements 189 Lgeato e strecto, e son libero e sciolto? Se tu incateni altrui senza catena (v) E senza mane o braccia m'ai racolto Many of these paradoxes arise from the life-death duality and are reminiscent of Robert South- well's and Richard Crashaw's "living death" and "dying life," or even Saint Teresa's "Vivo sin vivir en mi." Writes Michelangelo: "And thus, within my soul for a brief moment to? gether contrary life and death do I feel" (cix, 15). Other prominent examples are those verses evocative of Loyola's self-flagellation: "Viuo al pechato, a me morendo uiuo" (xxv) and "E quel riposo ch'anzi al nascer muore" (cix, 34). A device of baroque expression which challen- ges logicality and juxtaposes polarities and contradictory ideas, such as the "living death" just mentioned, is the oxymoron. Michelangelo lifted one of the most common, the "dolce amaro" (lxxv and cix, 81) from Petrarch. It appears again in "Vestito di dolcezza e d'amar pieno" (xii). However, the concept of bittersweet became so common that the French and English poets made a compound adjective of it. One not- able verse with two oxymora has already been quoted: "Crudel pietate e spietata mercede." However, this particular device of rhetoric and baroque expression was not too common with Michelangelo. Marino was to become the cham- pion practitioner of oxymora. The burning-freezing states which informed Petrarch's verses are frequent in Michelangelo, and applied to both sacred and profane love: Ch' oggi in un punto m'arde e ghiaccia el core (xv) L'una m'agghiaccia '1 core, Paltro Pinfiamma (xcvii) Ch'arde altrui di lontano e loro agghiaccia (cviii) Tra '1 foco e '1 cor di ghiaccio un uel s'asconde (cxl) Freddo al sol, caldo alle piu fredde brume (cix, 19) In this passage, recording the poet's need for God to manifest himself more fully, Michel? angelo comes closest to becoming an "oxymoron incarnate," as Spitzer called Phedre. These flames which flicker in the baroque poetry and art of others are found everywhere in Michel? angelo's Rime. They are, of course, harbingers of the all-consuming flames of the Day of Judge- ment ("solvet saeclum in favilla"), even more destructive than love's burnings. Flames and fire purify "to the highest degree," just as the goldsmith's fire makes a "perfect work" (cix, 61 and 87). Thus, Michelangelo writes of his soul, "Com' or purgata in foco, a Dio si torna" (cxxvi). And again, "fatto fumo e poluo, / Eterno ben saro, s'induro al foco" (cix, 88). Flames are agents, also, of metamorphosis, reducing the heart to cinders or the body to ashes. The flam- ing heart dominates the entire series of poems grouped by Frey under cix. Fire, that "calci- nates hard rock," burns the heart to a crisp (ci, 74). A sonnet centers on the point that if love's fire can destroy a "green heart," how much more quickly does an old, dry heart go up in smoke (cix, 86 and 58). Before leaving these interesting paradoxes and contrasts in the artist's Rime, and therefore in his mind, we should attend to several remarkably baroque lines of varying categories, verses more or less self-explanatory: Saria mortal senza la morte mia (cix, 41) D'un fonte di pieta nascie '1 mie male (xxi) E men ti piaccio, se piu m'afatico (iii) This last complaint was addressed to Pope Julius II, who had been listening to unkind rumors about the artist, and whose slights and harshness have left Michelangelo in an agitated state. Whether the pope ever read the sonnet is not known. Che con piu tempo il buon uoler men dura (clviii) This verse states Michelangelo's belief that grace is more difficult to achieve the longer one lives. Che mai non muore chi non guarisce mai (cix, 11) and the forthright paradox, "Meglio il peggio saria" (cix, 60), foliowed immediately by Contrari cibi an' si contrari effecti C a lei il godere, a noi torrien la uita (cix, 60) Another paradox is the contrary pull of the Platonic Eros and Anteros: "The one pulls toward heaven and the other pulls to earth, the one lodges in the soul and the other in the senses" (xci). Mention should be made of the baroque ele? ment of chiaroscuro. The light-shade contrast in Michelangelo's painting is not striking. In the poetry there are no word-pictures of a "cierto claroescuro," such as Hatzfeld has found in Cervantes, Gongora, Tasso, and Racine.15 If Michelangelo contrasts Night and Day on the Tomb of Giuliano de' Medici, there are few lighting effects behind the six poems in which night figures (lxxvi, lxxviii, xcvii, cix, 20, 21, and 27). I am at a loss, therefore, to understand 15 Helmut Hatzfeld, "A Clarification of the Baroque Prob? lem in the Romance Literatures," Comparative Literature, Spring 1949, pp. 128-129.</page><page sequence="9">190 Michelangelo as a Baroque Poet Hatzfeld's enthusiastic statement that "Michel? angelo, like Rembrandt, is permeated by this motif" (p. 128). In all these works there is only briefest mention that a torch or a lightning bug can "vanquish" night and a poetic reminder that at night the sun still lights the stars from afar. The inability of the baroque mind to view life as a positive or even a reality led him to the Calderonian premise that life is a dream. Michel? angelo, capable of panic dreams,16 capable of composing poetry in his dreams,17 and even capable of viewing life as fleet and transitory as a dream, uses the word "dream" in the Calderonian sense once in the Rime. In one of Michelangelo's epitaphs, the dead Cecchino reflects: . . . e s'alcun mi ricorda, Gli par sognar: si morte e presta e 'ngorda. Che quel che e stato non par che fussi mai. (lxxiii, 22) Such a dream is furthermore conveyed in his curious drawing, II Sogno della vita umana. Since Michelangelo's increasing mysticism led him to question the values by which he had lived his long life, we can only take satisfaction that doubts about art so evident in the late poetry did not reduce his production earlier in his career. Late in life he wondered whether he should not have become a Dominican friar, as had his brother, the better to serve God. As Calderon put it, without God "las humanas glorias son polvo, humo, ceniza, y viento."18 Read the unhappy renunciation of the fine arts in the following lines: Amor, le muse e le fiorite grotte Mie scombiccheri a cemboli, a cartocci, (lxxxi) A gli hosti, a cessi, a chiassi son condotte. Che gioua uoler far tanti bambocci, Se m' han condotto al fin, come colui Che passo '1 mar e poi affogo ne' mocci? or the magnificent complaint, where the early pride is crowded out by the senescent's terror: Con tanta seruitu, con tanto tedio E con falsi concecti e gran periglio (cxliv) Dell' alma a sculpir qui cose diuine. IV In discussing the paradoxes and ambivalences of the baroque mind, we have actually intruded upon the subject of this fourth section, devoted to the stylistic devices of baroque. For not only is paradox a state of the spirit; it is as well a device of verbal expression. We have, therefore, in the course of probing Michelangelo's baroque men- tality, shown how often he returned to stylistic effects betraying a dichotomy of the spirit: antithesis, oxymoron, and contrast. If we turn now to other stylistic elements of baroque high on recent lists, we will find many of these in Michelangelo. A vocabulary and reper- tory of images vibrant with energy and emotion is present. One means of achieving heightened emotional effect is repetition or echo effect: Oilme, oilme, oilme! (v) 0 Dio, o Dio, o Dio! (and bis) (vi) Vorrei uoler, Signior, quel ch' io non uoglio (cxl) Se Pamo e bramo e chiamo a tutte P ore (cix, 5) Occasionally a series is compounded for the same purpose : Mia pace, mio riposo, e mia salute (xlvi) Que' singulti e quei pianti e que' sospiri (xi) L'angoscia e '1 pianto e guai (xv) 0 carne, o sangue, o legnio, o doglia estrema (xlviii) The changing set of values as one grows older is fourfold: Per cangiar uita, amor, costume, o sorte (clv) Si cangia gusto, amor, uoglia e pensieri (cxlv) One has the impression that these scattered examples of echo devices and repetitions are significant precisely because they were not con? sciously introduced for literary effect, as in the baroque poetry of a D'Aubigne, and thus indi? cate unconscious tendency rather than conscious habit. Alliteration is not consistently practised by Michelangelo, although there are a few note- worthy examples: Lezi, uezzi, carezze o feste e perle (cxiv) Mi sprona, sfrena e sferza (cxxii) Se la miseria medica la morte (cxvi) One of the concomitants of the transitory nature of life is metamorphosis, a concept to which the baroque poets gave the most elastic meaning. These transmutations are apparent also in Michelangelo. Over and over the loved one's eyes set fire to the lover and reduce him to 16 Flights to Venice (1529) and Bologna (1494) resulted from this panic; in the latter case, two dreams of Andrea Cardiere started Michelangelo off: Milanesi, Lettere di Michelangelo Buonarroti (Florence, 1875), p. 457 and Con- divi, Vita, see. xiv. 17 These admissions by Michelangelo are reproduced in the Girardi edition of the Rime (Bari, 1960), pp. 356, 410. 18 El mdgico prodigioso, ra, 21-24.</page><page sequence="10">Robert J. Clements 191 burnt wood (cix, 43 and 75). Indeed, three such changes (fire&gt;ice, laughter&gt;weeping, body &gt;charred wood) occur in the stanza "Nella me- moria delle cose belle." In the sequence to Cecchino de' Bracci, the beauty of the dead adolescent leaves Michelangelo in a mood to ponder rebirth. The thought of the boy's regain- ing his beauty keeps coming back. The boy's beauty has been reborn in the headstone. The boy will recapture his beauty ("il suo bei uelo") even before souls are reclothed on Judgement Corvi) by the sketch of a crow, or by placing horns on his Moses.20 Yet there are many puns in his Rime, all based on names. The reader may decide whether this displays a baroque mind or the imitation of Petrarch, whose double-punning verse "Rotf e l'alta colonna e '1 uerde lauro" (i) he copied onto the Louvre sketch of his bronze David. Or whether it is both baroque and Petrar? chan, since this would not be inconsistent, to repeat a point made earlier. The verse is repro? duced after the name punned upon: Tommaso Cavalieri Resto prigion d'un Cavalier armato (lxxvi) Febo di Poggio Mentre che Febo il poggio tucto ardea (chi) Pope Julius II A prender fructo d'un arbor, ch'esecho (iii) (i.e., "a tree (oak) that is withered" or "a Della Rovere one is with") Clement VII Monsignor Pietro Carnesecchi Faustina Lucia Mancini Cecchino de' Bracci Cecchino de' Bracci Al Medico maggior de' nostri mali (lvii) La Came, che nel sal si purga e stenta (lvii) Se con la dritta man fece a defesa Campaua; onde nol fe', ch'era Mancina (cix, 67) Meglio era esser de Piedi per fuggire Che de' Bracci e non far da lei difesa (lxxiii, 6) Qui stese il Braccio, e colse acerbo il fructo (lxxiii, 44) Day (lxxiii, 49). Or can the lad's beauty ever be regained, like a withered tree blooming again in springtime? No, "ch'uom morto non resurge a primauera" (lxxiii, 21). The changes in Michelangelo's own body dur? ing the lengthy aging process are a constant, gnawing theme: Caduto e '1 fructo, e secha e gia la scorza, (cix, 81) E quel gia dolce amaro or par ch' i' senta C'ancor ch' i cangi '1 pelo Per gl' ultim' anni e corti, (lxxxvii) Cangiar non posso il uechio mie antico uso Another common theme of metamorphosis is that of the phoenix, which Michelangelo employed five times (xlvi, lxxiii, 39; cii; cix, 42 and 87), applying it to himself: "II ciel m'inuola, / Un carbon resto acceso e ricoperto" (cii). Lists of baroque elements in literature often include the pun, not so much as an evidence of humor as of the instability and mutability of words themselves. Crashaw's Latin and English puns are a variant of his epigrammatic "points," expressing paradox and antithesis, according to Warren.19 By quoting the example of the Cumae- an Sibyl holding her book at arm's length (see above) we have alleged that Michelangelo some? times punned in his art. He also punned by re- placing the word Corvi in his address (Macel dei The habit of incarnation or personification associated with baroque extended to the allegori? cal figures in Michelangelo's Rime. The allegories of Night and Day have the power of speech (cix, 17, and xvii). In the stanzas in praise of rustic life, allegorical figures of Doubt, Truth, Fraud, Hypocrisy, and Adulation are depicted in detail. Thus, Truth is a poor and lonely wanderer, with body of gold, heart of diamond, and one gleaming eye. Elsewhere the two gigantic figures represent? ing Fury and Pride (according to Michelangelo the Younger, who edited the poetry), parents of the seven deadly sins, are portrayed fully (lxix). A final personification is that of the city of Florence, an attractive young woman ravished by the Medici tyrant (cix, 48). The occasional surrealistic visions or dreams of baroque were not unfamiliar to Michelangelo. Magnificent visions they were: Saint Teresa seeing Christ play with her soul as with a tennis ball, Richard Crashaw viewing the wounds of Christ as mouths and eyes, Theophile witnessing a serpent on a tower tearing apart a vulture, John Davies of Hereford contemplating "frozen hearts floating in sulphred streams." Michel- 19 Austin Warren, Richard Crashaw (Ann Arbor, 1957), pp. 81-90. 20 Margaret MacLean, "The Horns on Michelangelo's Moses," Art and Archeology, vi (August, 1917) 97-99.</page><page sequence="11">192 Michelangelo as a Baroque Poet angelo was capable of such visions, such "brain- work of a perverted intelligence," as Eliot puts it.21 After the martyrdom of Savonarola he saw a flaming sky over the city of Florence.22 If he did not see through the special vision of a Brueghel or a Bosch, he had such various moral visions as the Day of Wrath, the Baccanalia dei putti, and the Saettatori. Touches of surrealism are notably few, however, in the Rime. The following verses bespeak an apocalyptic vision: II ciel porgie le chiaue; Amor le uolgie e gira E apre a iusti il pecto di costei (cix, 79) The veil of ice separating the artist from his God: "Tra '1 foco e '1 cor di ghiaccio un uel s'asconde" (cxl) would also fall into this category, as would the eye swelling to become the body: "Fa del mie corpo tucto un ochio solo" (cix, 8). Of the four categories of baroque here ex- plored, the Counter-Reformational spirit and the mysticism of his poetry inform his art as well. His intimate relationship with Christ, based now on pity and affection and now on fear, becomes autobiographical in the Nicodemus-Michelangelo commiserating with Christ in the Deposizione of Santa Maria del Fiore or in the Bartholomew- Michelangelo left despoiled by the Christus Judex in the Giudizio universale. The lack of will, aboulia, ambivalence conveyed by his poetry can be read on the features of such figures as Adam of the Creazione di Adamo, the Sogno, or even the Bacco. Of the devices utilised by baroque poetry, spectacle and theatricality reach a high point on the Sistine Vault. In general, the emotionalism and tensions which characterise baroque are more consistently observable in Michelangelo's Rime than in his art. Late in his life, when this genius set down his mallet and chisel and neg- lected his brush in that "season which cracks the bow and wings" (cix, 29), his pen became more active than ever and his style more predictably baroque. Michelangelo's Rime thus assurehim a place in the recently-expanding family of baroque poets. True, he does not illustrate evenly the various characteristics of baroque. Some are abundant, some are barely represented, and, indeed, some (asyndeta, etc.) are absent from his canzoniere. But then there are many of these characteristics now recognised as baroque absent in Crashaw himself, and Douglas Bush could no longer define baroque as the way Richard Crashaw wrote poetry, any more than we could define it as the way Michelangelo wrote his sonnets and madri- gals. Even Racine does not illustrate evenly all the elements of neoclassicism. Scott and Byron, so unlike, are indisputably English Romantics. Sooner or later it will be acknowledged that there is a similar variation permissible among the baroque writers, without complicating the pic? ture with mannerism and the rest. Considering the fact that Michelangelo was born in 1475, forty years before Teresa Sanchez de Cepeda y Ahumada de Avila, one hundred and thirty- seven years before Richard Crashaw, he was not only one of the most versatile baroque poets, but also one of the earliest.
