<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS tends, with his exaltation of metaphysics, to minimize religion with its "sentimental," "con- solatory," and anthropomorphic elements (pp. I24 ff.). This reviewer is not sure that the au- thor actually does justice to the religious char- acteristics of a theistic Hinduism or Mahayana Buddhism where the elements he criticizes in the religions of revelation abound. Every student of India will welcome the treatment of the six darshana or philosophical "viewpoints" in Hinduism and of their ter- minology (chaps. viii ff.). Mr. Guenon's book should be widely read as a stimulating introduction to Eastern thought, though not without criticism by those who dis- like to replace one onesidedness by another and who are conscious of a heritage which is more substantial than it is made out to be by some. JOACHIM WACH University of Chicago From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology. Trans- lated by H. H. GERTH and C. WRIGHT MILLS. New York: Oxford University Press, I946. 490 pages. $5.00. The present translation is of essays in the field of science, politics, power, religion, and social structures. These essays supplement the translations previously made. Part I has to do with politics and science as vocations. One might use Weber's analysis of science as a vocation as a model for the analysis of the problems one finds in entering any voca- tion. He outlines the "hazards" of the scientist and also the basic ethics of a profession. Part II is a sociological treatment of power- the structure of power in the "Great Powers" and in the economic foundations of imperialism and the role of the nation in relation to these. Here Weber presents his sociology of charis- matic authority. He points out that the "nat- ural leader" in times of crisis has not been the office-holder but the possessor of special gifts. This leader soon develops a sense of mission and calls upon his followers to sacrifice for the cause. Efforts are made to transfer these charismatic gifts to some of his followers, and so the prac- tice of the consecration of the religious leaders arises. One cannot even catalogue here the outstand- ing propositions of Part III, "The Social Psy- chology of the World Religions." Weber, in treating the relationship of religious to social and economic conditions, does not conceive that the specific nature of a religion "is a simple function of the social situation of the stratum which appears as its characteristic bearer or that it presents the stratum's ideology" (p. 269). He says that "it receives its stamp primar- ily from the religions sources, and, first of all, from the content of its annunciation and its promise." The annunciation and the promise of a reli- gion are the work of its prophets. He says that there are two kinds of prophets: "exemplary" and "emissary." The exemplary prophet points to salvation by exemplary living, while the emissary prophet is an instrument of God who makes ethical demands in the name of God. Men are differently qualified to heed example or hear the voice of God. His essay included in this translation was written to supplement his earlier work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (translated by Parsons). Under the heading "Religious Rejections of the World and Their Directions," he describes in negative forms the relationship of religions to the world. Since the world in its various phases is imperfect and cannot offer salvation, religions must reject all the phases of the world. The first opposition is the "natural sib," and so the followers of Jesus needed to be hostile to the members of their households. There is also a sharp tension with the economic and political aspects of life. So also there is tension between "the ethic of religious brotherliness and the spheres of esthetic and erotic life" and with in- tellectual knowledge and culture. In Part IV, Weber treats "Social Structures" dealing with capitalism and rural society in Germany with the Junkers and their relation- ship to the national character of Germany. Fur- ther discussion of social structures is given in the use of caste and social rank in India and the Chinese literati. In these analyses Weber makes use of the ideal typological approach. When the typologi- cal method is used without any statistical or quantitative checkup, numerous errors may enter in. This volume is a small library in itself and contains hypotheses for extended study and re- search in the sociology of religion, in theology, and in the social sciences.

KINCHELOE University of Chicago The United States Moves across the Pacific: The A.B.C.'s of the AmericanProblem in the West- ern Pacific and the Far East. By KENNETH SCOTT LATOURETTE. New York and London: Harper &amp; Bros. ix+I74 pages. $2.00. "The entrance of the United States into World War II by way of the Pacific rather than the Atlantic has deep significance. The fateful December 7, I941, was not an accident. It came in consequence of a long chain of events which go back into the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Through them the United States has become increasingly committed to active par- ticipation in Far Eastern affairs. The policy through which the United States was drawn into the conflict then in progress in China and the western Pacific .... represents a trend which is as old as the westward movement of the American frontier." In these opening sen- tences of his Preface, Professor Latourette strikes the keynote of his study. A good many years ago Professor Herbert H. Gowen of the University of Washington struck the same note in the Preface to one of his works when he called attention to the fact that, in reality, the front door of the United States opens onto the Pacific and toward Japan and China, while its back door opens to the Atlantic and Europe. In the field of fiction, a bit later, Alice Tisdale Hobart directed attention to the same basic fact in her portrayals of the impact of the Mechanical and the Industrial revolutions and of American Big Business upon the Middle Kingdom, in her River Supreme and Oil for the Lamps of China. Having established his reputation as a sound professional historian through a long generation by publication of such scholarly works as The Chinese: Their History and Culture, A History of Christian Missions in China, and, more re- cently, an encyclopedic work on the expansion of Christianity throughout the world, La- tourette has now added to his countrymen's indebtedness to him-and it is a very real in- debtedness-by preparing in popular form, as avowedly indicated in the subtitle to this work, a clearly, simply, and urbanely told story of the expansion of American interests and activities in the Pacific and the Far East, including south- eastern Asia. In three well-balanced chapter- essays, entitled: "The Far-Eastward Drive of the United States," "The Far East with Which the United States Must Reckon," and "The Far Eastern Policy of the United States in the Years Immediately Ahead," the story is succinctly told. Only a scholar can popularize with wisdom and accuracy and brevity. A scholar Latourette is, and with wisdom, accuracy, and brevity he has popularized so successfully that American businessmen, members of Congress, and those who eat their way to knowledge at noonday luncheons need no longer complain that the Pacific and far eastern "problem" is too "com- plicated" for them to "understand." Which is not to insinuate that others more advanced in studies in these fields need not attend to Latourette's statements and conclusions-with some of which they may possibly disagree in part. For example, it may be held debatable whether Soviet Russia will play as negative a role in the areas under consideration as is sug- gested; the Koreans, at any rate, will hope that their future maybe brighter not thanLatourette hopes but than he appears to fear it will be; and careful readers of Professor Warren Thompson's Population and Peace in the Pacific will probably be more critical and fearful re the presumed dis- position of territories in the Pacific and eastern Asia than Latourette makes it clear that he is. This work, then, should be read by the millions of Americans-and others-who are directly and indirectly involved with the subject han- dled, and it should be read in comparison with the one just mentioned and with Professor Lattimore's Solution in Asia.
