<plain_text><page sequence="1">Juno: A Study in Early Roman Religion. By EMILY LEDYARD SHIELDS. Northampton, Mass.: Smith College, 1926. Pp. 74. By the diligent and careful investigation of the last fifty years much has been done to reveal the true character of early Roman religion; for, during the past half-century, it has been the problem of scholars to remove the deposits of Greek,</page><page sequence="2">86 BOOK REVIEWS Etruscan, Egyptian, and Asiatic ideas which have encrusted and buried the earliest religious beliefs of the Romans. .... In the process no one of the deities seems to have undergone a greater change than has Juno. Thus does Professor Shields prepare the way (Introd., p. 1) for a careful, scholarly, and helpful study of Juno in her various relations and attributes. On pages 2-6, the views of such sturdy investigators as Aust, Fowler, Toutain, Bailey, Preller, Otto, and Wissowa are presented. Miss Shields, however, values most highly the conclusions of J. Whatmough (Classical Quarterly, XVI, 181-89), and announces (p. 6), "It is the purpose of this study to make at least a preliminary survey of the field, with a view to a possible return to the former idea that the origin of Juno-worship is related to Jupiter and that she was first a goddess of light." The etymology of the name is considered in the foilowing chapter. The opinions of scholars from Varro to Whatmough are cited. Miss Shields thinks that "if Mr. Whatmough has not absolutely proved an etymological connec- tion with Jupiter, yet he has answered excellently the objections offered in this matter during the last twenty years" (p. 10). She continues (p. 11): "We should, however, heed the warning that etymological evidence in the case of deities is almost sure to be misleading unless it is absolutely certain and is supported by the history of the name." The longest (and most satisfactory) chapter is devoted to the association of Jupiter and Juno. The other chapters deal with Juno and Janus, Juno and Genius, Juno and Hercules, Juno and Fortuna, Juno and Caprotina, Juno and Curritis, Juno and Lucina, Juno and Moneta, Juno and Regina, Juno and Sospita. In her conclusion, Professor Shields deposes that it is "practically impos- sible to gain accurate information about any problem of Rome's primitive religion." Certainly nobody will question that statement; and, equally certain- ly, everybody will applaud the author's courage in tackling so doughty a mat- ter and will be satisfied if Miss Shields has attained unto Cicero's "greatest possible measure of probability." This, in the reviewer's opinion, she has done. Her concluding paragraph may well be quoted: Though perhaps she was not a quality or characteristic of Jupiter originally, Juno was probably worshipped as a related female power, like Libera beside Liber or Fauna beside Faunus. The ancient Roman, scrupulously careful to appeal to the proper deity, would imagine the great power of the over-arching sky in both gen- ders. Juno was not in any sense an anthropomorphic mate to Jupiter at first, though in later centuries under Greek influence she was readily considered as such. She arose from the careful Roman ritual which prays, sive deus, sive dea es, sive mas, sive femina. HUBERT MCNEILL POTEAT WAKFE FOREST COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
