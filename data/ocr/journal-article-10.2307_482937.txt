Pre-Columbian monumental architecture and hieroglyphic texts have traditionally lent the ancient Maya the popular allure of "mystery." This in turn has drawn scholars of post-Conquest sources to written or painted texts-and oral records-which illuminate the pre-Conquest past, or has inspired them to focus on that aspect of such sources. As a result, market forces and the popular press have often encour- aged an ongoing romantic, sensational view of the ancient Maya, to the detriment of revisionist scholarship (epigraphers such as Linda Schele have even been denounced in the press by anthropologists as unscientific, unanthropological, and "political"). Meanwhile, the colonialist view of the post-Conquest Maya as a decrepit civilization (symbolized by the be- lief of many early modern Europeans and Euro-Americans that the ancient Maya only created Classic civilization with extrahemispheric assistance) has effectively been perpetuated by the diversion of colonial-era Maya sources into pre-Conquest studies and the use of Spanish sources to study the colonial-era Maya. At the same time, the diverse and fragmented nature of primary sources on the Maya has contributed to the narrow focus of most of the serious work published by agronomists, anthropologists, archaeologists, art historians, astronomers, epigraphers, ethnographers, geographers, his- torians, and linguists, who have thus failed to create, as Barbara Tedlock recently pointed out (in the summer I993 issue of Latin American Re- search Review), "an international multidisciplinary forum [for] Mayan Studies" (I55). No doubt, in time, the barriers to a Mayanist ecumenism will crumble. Meanwhile, a selection of recent publications illustrates both the traditional weaknesses and the growing strengths of Mayanist scholarship. In terms of their ability to communicate important new findings to nonspecialists, Precolumbian Population History in the Maya Lowlands and Cuello, An Early Maya Community in Belize are somewhat obfus- cating; to appreciate the significance of the work they present, the reader must wade through a veritable Pulltrouser Swamp of microstudy data and subdiscipline terminology. The former, especially narrow in focus, offers a significant challenge for any nonarchaeodemographer, whereas the latter (its $90 price tag aside) tends to be dense and dry. On the other hand, neither volume purports to be anything other than the scientific presentation of research by specialists to their colleagues; Culbert and Rice are particularly open in this respect, asserting that it</page><page sequence="3">Review Essay I53 was necessary to adopt "a very tight focus" and "keep interesting but tan- gential issues from arising" (xix, xx). From the specialist's perspective, and within their own fields, both books are historiographical monuments. They include impressive lists of contributors, present scholarship of the highest caliber, and offer insights and conclusions that will permanently alter our understanding of certain aspects of Maya civilization. The chief contribution of the studies compiled by Culbert and Rice may be a methodological one (as they produce no fundamental revision in population estimates). The editors' introduction and an essay by Robert Santley place the fourteen contributions in a historiographical context and are thereby crucial to the volume. Considering the sources available to archaeodemographers (such as the size, layout, and density of the re- mains of residential structures) and the number of variables affecting those sources (such as occupants per room and the moving of house sites), these studies are a tribute to the ingenuity of scholars in this subfield and their increasing sophistication of technique. The Cuello volume is a compilation of studies in a different sense than the Precolumbian Population collection. As members of the I975- 87 excavation team at the Belizean site, the scholars under Hammond's direction collaborated directly, which is reflected in the structure of the final report on their findings. As director, Hammond was well positioned to act as editor, effectively organizing the contributions and sandwiching them between his introduction and conclusion. If the book is a little dis- appointing in its efforts to reach a broader readership, it is nonetheless held together by its focus on a few interrelated issues that contain most of the significance of the Cuello project. One controversial issue concerns the Swasey Phase: How far back did it go and what impact does it have on our view of other sites? (Not as far and not as much as was thought earlier in the project.) Another is the question of social structure: Cuello demonstrates that, according to mor- tuary and other evidence, stratification replaced a relative egalitarianism in the Late Preclassic. A key aspect of this process was the evolution of early leaders into semi-deified ancestors and the concomitant rise in the social stock of their living descendants. Finally, it is Cuello's very lack of importance as a community in the Maya area that makes it important to us: there are few, if any, Maya sites this early and this well preserved. As a result, Hammond and his team are able to tell us so much about Meso- american village life three thousand years ago that one wonders whether previously remote questions-such as exactly how and when sites like Cuello initially emerged as sedentary communities-might not soon be answered.</page><page sequence="4">I54 Review Essay In an ideal world, the final report on Cuello would be published in two formats, one a scholarly tome along the lines of the Cambridge Uni- versity Press edition, the other a Thames and Hudson production similar to that press's superbly packaged I993 releases of Michael Coe's fifth edi- tion of The Maya, William Fash's paperback Copdn, and Mary Miller and Karl Taube's An Illustrated Dictionary of Mesoamerican Religion. Unfor- tunately, Taube's Aztec and Maya Myths, despite a similar abundance of illustrations, is something of a lesser sibling to An Illustrated Dictionary, with which it overlaps in terms of substance as well as authorship. With the actual text running to some forty-five pages, Myths is essentially a long synthetic essay aimed at the undergraduate and museum-going pub- lic (it is published in collaboration with the British Museum Press and as part of a "Legendary Past Series" on the "myths" of various civilizations). In this regard, the book succeeds admirably, being well informed and in- telligently written. Professionals of all fields, however, will want a more sophisticated appraisal of sources and a deeper discussion of the relation- ships between myth, history, and religious belief and ritual; in short, they would do better with Taube and Miller's Dictionary. In Scribes, Warriors, and Kings, William Fash achieves a superb bal- ance between detailed, evidenced, original scholarly research and a pre- sentation accessible in its context, structure, and consistency of conclu- sions. On the one hand, the book has a popular veneer to it, from the title, to the izo illustrations, to the format (characteristic Thames and Hudson production values), to an opening chapter that sets the scene in an undergraduate-friendly way-including both a time chart and a clear explanation of "the Maya system of time-reckoning." On the other hand, Fash provides what is to date the most compre- hensive and detailed discussion of past and ongoing work at the site of Copdn; as a participant since I976 and as current coordinator of research in the Copdn valley, he is certainly qualified for the task. Nor does he de- vote too much space to his own Mosaics Project, a seemingly Sisyphean but remarkably successful effort to reconstruct the jumbled mounds of sculpted details fallen from crumbled walls. Also given sufficient atten- tion is the work of epigraphers such as Nikolai Grube, Berthold Riese, Linda Schele, and David Stuart, and earlier and current archaeological in- vestigations by Wendy Ashmore, Claude Baudez, William Sanders, David Webster, and Gordon Willey (whose student Fash was). The list goes on- Alfred Maudslay first excavated the site a century ago-for Copdn is im- portant both historiographically and historically. Thus in pulling together his own work with that of others, Fash is able to show how this "Athens</page><page sequence="5">Review Essay I55 of the New World" (i6; quoting Sylvanus Morley) is an exemplary site for the development of our understanding of the Classic Maya. Now out in paperback (with a half-page update), Fash's book re- ceived justifiably rave reviews when first published in cloth in i99i. By expertly interweaving the researchers' tale of step-by-step discovery with the historical story of the sixteen kings of Copan's Yax K'uk Mo' dy- nasty (A.D. 4z6-8zz), Fash turns painstaking archaeology into a genuine page-turner. For example, he sets up two possible theories on why the Hieroglyphic Stairway was built, then details the methods and discover- ies of the team who worked on the building and its sculptures, before finally letting us in on why the evidence appears to favor the view that the stairway was a revivalist monument aimed at restoring morale after the Quirigud defeat. Another example relates to one of the more significant contributions of the book: at the end, Fash sets up the question of the col- lapse by summarizing past views, before offering his own theory, followed by evidence, of "a nobles' revolt" (I75) akin to the dynastic feuds that brought down Mayapan six centuries later. The creation of monumental architecture came to an end with the fall of the dynasty, and Copan went into a gradual demographic, economic, and political decline. Central to the evidence supporting Fash's collapse theory is the re- search conducted outside the city center among the ruins of suburban and rural compounds. This work reveals not only "inter-lineage competition" (i8i) but also provides a perspective on those Maya that constituted the majority of Copdn's twenty thousand residents-the intended audience, after all, of the "politico-religious advertisements" (34) of the Principal Group. Clearly we would like to know a great deal more about the Maya masses at Copdn and elsewhere, but Fash is to be commended for "starting to bridge the yawning gap between elite and non-elite studies" (7). The elite-nonelite dichotomy is relevant to Robert Patch's Maya and Spaniard in two ways. One is broad: just as Fash seeks both to recon- cile elite and nonelite studies and to reconstruct social relations between Maya nobles and commoners, so does Patch aim to bring together Maya and Spaniard both as historical groups in colonial Yucatan and as his- toriographical threads. The other segue is specific to source materials: because the more obvious sources (monuments and hieroglyphs) tell us so much more about the Maya elite than about the nonelite, Fash must turn to the evidence of tools, ceramics, skeletons, and the remains of houses to learn of the nonelite; however, because Patch's Spanish sources also reveal something of Maya society and its economy, Patch is able to draw an image of both groups using the texts of only one.</page><page sequence="6">i56 Review Essay This parallel would seem to imply that the pre-Conquest elite-nonelite division becomes a colonial Spaniard-Maya division. This very conclu- sion was more or less that of Nancy Farriss in her Maya Society (I984). Patch goes some of the way toward modifying this view, but, in looking at the Maya nobility, he is unable to see much beyond the indios hidal- gos, indigenous nobles recognized by the Spanish authorities, because his sources are exclusively Spanish. A more complex picture, however, is re- vealed by Mayan language notarial documents from the colonial period; they show that there was also a rank of nobility recognized only by the Maya themselves, that the Maya nobility retained their dominance within their own communities, where they exercised social status, wielded eco- nomic power, and controlled political offices. What's more, the sources give us far more access to everyday life in the Maya community, or cah (as the Yucatec Maya called it), than Patch's Spanish documentary infor- mants. The perspective of Hispanocentric sources has highlighted rather than bridged "the yawning gap" between Spaniard and Maya (as Clendin- nen's Ambivalent Conquests [1987] demonstrated). In this sense, Patch does not bridge that gap as well as might be hoped. Nevertheless, Maya and Spaniard is an extremely impressive work of scholarship whose contribution to the historical literature of colonial Yucatan is considerable and well overdue-the volume is an updated, edited, and chronologically extended version of Patch's I979 doctoral dis- sertation. Any book on this subject that can pack, with relevance, Marx, Galeano, Braudel, and Garcia Mdrquez into its opening introductory paragraphs promises stimulating reading. In fact, Patch has not only ex- tended his source base, and thus the time frame, of his study, but he has intellectually fine-tuned the best of his dissertation. The work will inevi- tably be compared to that of Farriss; it should fare well. Patch's book is not as long or as comprehensive, but its focus on the colonial economy (and the social implications thereof) arguably lend it a more tangible co- herence. Patch also tackles with greater incision some of the questions raised by Farriss, such as the topic of Maya parcialidades, or sociopoliti- cal subunits, and the issue of Yucatan's historical and regional "unique- ness." With Marta Hunt's i974 doctoral dissertation still unpublished, Patch provides a much needed examination of the nature of the "colonial regime"; it is when writing about Spaniards that this volume is most com- pelling and makes its greatest contribution. As a complement to Maya Society, Maya and Spaniard will be compulsory reading for all students of colonial Yucatan and will be of interest to colonial Latin Americanists in general. If Patch neither asks nor answers all the questions, he certainly</page><page sequence="7">Review Essay I57 sets high standards for those who wish to further pursue the Maya in the colonial period. If it is time to cease studying indigenous peoples with exclusively non- indigenous sources, it is certainly time to cease referring to those peoples as "Indians." This criticism is not leveled at Patch or at the countless other colonialist and modernist scholars who still use this admittedly useful term. Yet the virtual absence of such a term in volumes such as Taube's, Hammond's, and Culbert and Rice's reflects the undue influence of the sources traditionally used to study indigenous peoples after the Conquest. Furthermore, it is work such as Patch's that, in shedding more light on colonial societies, continues to help expose the "fallacies of 'Indianness' (to use Kay Warren's term in her essay in the Stepan-edited Americas: New Interpretive Essays [i99z]). Indirectly, Montejo's compilation of Fables also provides food for thought on this subject. The Bird Who Cleans the World and Other Mayan Fables is a nicely illustrated and engagingly realized collection of thirty-two Maya folktales that explore the harmony and conflict of social interaction through the medium of miniature morality plays enacted by anthropomorphic animals. It follows Montejo's harrowing account of his personal experience of the violence that drove him into exile (Tes- timony: Death of a Guatemalan Village [I987]), although that work is more in the genre of the autobiographical I, Rigoberta Mencha (I984), whereas Mayan Fables complements Dennis Tedlock's Breath on the Mir- ror: Mythic Voices and Visions of the Living Maya (I993). A potential problem with Montejo's volume is that, lacking any context beyond a brief author's preface and a briefer introduction by Allan Burns, it might contribute to a reader's preconception of Maya culture as romantic and childlike. Not that Montejo must consider the modern Western associa- tion of anthropomorphic animals with children's stories, but Tedlock's Mythic Voices subsumes this problem in a recontextualization of similar fables among pre- and post-Conquest written sources as well as personal encounters. Montejo's collection of folktales is both a primary and a second- ary source; he himself is both a Jakaltek Maya man from an indigenous Guatemalan community and an anthropologist living in Connecticut. It is ironic that a new source genre (Maya literature in English) is being created to perpetuate Maya cultural integrity by Jakaltek and Quiche individuals such as Montejo and Menchi, and by the Kanjobal refugees in Los Ange- les who publish through the IXIM organization; their direct persecutors have forced them to live in and communicate through (and to) the very</page><page sequence="8">I58 Review Essay culture that-to simplify a historically complex process-has provided indirect impetus to that persecution. Yet this phenomenon may also be the continuation of a traditional Maya capacity for adapting outside re- sources-be they introduced by other Mesoamericans, Spanish colonists, or the modern West-to protect and to serve community ends (cultural plurality does not necessarily mean cultural loss). Whether "community" will continue to be defined at a municipal level (like ancient Cuello and Copin, and like the cahob of colonial Yucatan) or at an ethnic or pan- ethnic level (for Montejo's Jakaltek tales are Mayan fables) remains to be seen.</page></plain_text>
