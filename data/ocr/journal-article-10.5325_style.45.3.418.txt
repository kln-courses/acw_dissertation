<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Elena Semino Lancaster University Deixis and Fictional Minds Introduction In this essay I show how marked patterns in the use of deictic expressions in literary  texts (e.g., “I,” “you,” “this,” “that”) can contribute to the projection of fictional minds  that appear to work in “nonstandard” or “unorthodox” ways (see Leech and Short;  Margolin). More specifically, I suggest that the inherent “egocentricity” of deictic  expressions can be exploited to represent strikingly “egocentric” fictional minds. I  begin by locating this study against the background of recent work on fictional minds  in narratology and on mind style in literary stylistics. I then discuss in detail two  examples from different genres: the poetic persona in Ted Hughes’s poem “Wodwo”  and the first-person narrator in Mark Haddon’s novel The Curious Incident of the  Dog in the Night-Time. In each case, I point out the presence of patterns in the use  of deictic expressions that can be described as idiosyncratic, and I argue that these  patterns interact with other textual phenomena to contribute to the impression of a  fictional mind that works in a striking and peculiar way. The creation of such minds  is an important part of the significance and distinctiveness of both texts. My claims  about the idiosyncratic use of certain types of deictic expressions in the two texts  are supported by quantitative comparisons with relevant larger corpora conducted  by means of the online corpus-comparison software tool Wmatrix.  Fictional Minds The notions of “consciousness,” “mind,” and “mental functioning” have recently  come to occupy centre stage in narratology, and particularly in the work of  narratologists who draw from cognitive science in order to account for the  characteristics and comprehension of fictional narratives (e.g., Herman; Zunshine).  Monika Fludernik has proposed that the essential characteristic of narrative is not  the presence of a plot, but the presence of the consciousness of an anthropomorphic  protagonist, through which actions and events are filtered (see also Lodge). More  specifically, Fludernik defines “narrativity” in terms of “experientiality,” namely  “the quasi-mimetic evocation of ‘real-life experience’” (13), and adds that: 418  Style: Volume 45, No. 3, Fall 2011 </page> <page sequence="2"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 419 since humans are conscious thinking beings, (narrative) experientiality always implies —  and sometimes emphatically foregrounds — the protagonist’s consciousness. Narrativity  can emerge from the experiential portrayal of dynamic event sequences which are already  configured emotively and evaluatively, but it can also consist in the experiential depiction  of human consciousness tout court.  (22) In Fictional Minds, Alan Palmer has boldly stated that “narrative fiction is, in  essence, the presentation of fictional mental functioning,” and, hence, the study of  the novel “is the study of fictional mental functioning” (5). Palmer adopts a broad  definition of “mind,” which includes emotions, beliefs and dispositions as well as  cognition and perception (19). More importantly, Palmer has drawn attention to  phenomena that had traditionally been neglected in the study of narrative fiction,  notably the presence of a wider range of textual indications of mental functioning  than is captured by traditional accounts of thought presentation, and the tendency  for much fictional mental functioning to be socially shared or “intermental,” rather  than individual or “intramental” (see also Palmer’s Social Minds in the Novel).  Uri Margolin similarly argues that, in order to make sense of fictional narratives,  readers or listeners have to attribute to characters human or human-like “cognitive  mental functioning.” In addition, Margolin points out that literature often explores  fictional mental functioning beyond what is conventionally regarded as “normal”: What is probably even more significant is the preference of much literature for nonstandard  forms of cognitive functioning, be they rare or marginal, deviant, or involving a failure,  breakdown, or lack of standard patterns.  (287) In literary stylistics, similar observations have been made by scholars who have  studied the variety of linguistic patterns that contribute to the projection of the  distinctive “mind styles” of characters, narrators or authors. The notion of “mind  style” was originally introduced by Fowler in Linguistics and the Novel: We may coin the term “mind style” to refer to any distinctive linguistic representation of  an individual mental self.  (103) Cumulatively, consistent structural options, agreeing in cutting the presented world to one  pattern or another, give rise to an impression of a world view, what I shall call a “mind  style.”  (76) Geoffrey Leech and Martin Short subsequently proposed a cline from “normal,”  “natural,” “uncontrived” mind styles at one end, to, at the other end, “unusual” mind  styles, “which clearly impose an unorthodox conception of the fictional world”  (151, 188–189). By and large, studies of mind style tend to focus on narrators and  characters that fall at the “unorthodox” end of the scale, such as, for example, Lok  in Golding’s The Inheritors (Halliday, “Literary Style”; Leech and Short; Fowler,  </page> <page sequence="3"> 420 Elena Semino Linguistic Criticism), Benjy in Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury (Leech and  Short; Fowler, Linguistic Criticism), and Bromden in Kesey’s One Flew Over the  Cuckoo’s Nest (Semino and Swindlehurst).  Jean Boase-Beier suggests that what characterizes the notion of mind style is  “a consistent stylistic pattern in the text as evidence of a particular cognitive state”  and applies the concept to the analysis of poetry and its translation (263–4). Boase- Beier is particularly concerned with authorial mind styles but recognizes that “in  speaking of the poet we mean an implied poet, who, like Booth’s ‘implied author,’  is recreated by the reader from the textual evidence” (255). This is consistent with  the view, expressed for example by Anthony Easthope and Vimala Herman, that  poetic voices are best seen as textual constructs, which arise in the interaction  between readers and texts.  Within both the narratological and stylistics traditions, it has been pointed  out that the presentation of the workings of minds that are perceived as unusual  can lead to a reassessment, on the reader’s part, of what it means to be “normal.”  Margolin, for example, has suggested that the presentation of the “breakdown  and failure” of cognitive mechanisms in fiction “is itself a powerful cognitive tool  which may make us aware of actual cognitive mechanisms, and, more specifically,  of our own mental functioning” (278). Similarly, Leech and Short have pointed  out that the language used in the Sound and the Fury to convey Benjy’s “childlike  vision” “borders on poetry in recapturing a pristine awareness of things” (166).  In other words, the presentation of nonstandard mental functioning, or of unusual  mind styles, can have a “deautomatizing” or “schema refreshing” effect on readers  (Shklovsky; Cook) who are exposed to ways of making sense of experience that  they perceive as different from their own and hence have the opportunity to consider  afresh their understanding of the world and of “normality” (see also Draaisma). Within the tradition of the study of mind style that goes back to Roger Fowler’s  work, a variety of types of linguistic patterns have been shown to be relevant to the  projection of distinctive mind styles. These include patterns of choice in terms of  vocabulary (e.g., Leech and Short; Fowler, Linguistic Criticism), grammar (e.g.,  Leech and Short; Fowler, Linguistic Criticism), transitivity (e.g., Halliday, “Literary  Style”; Fowler, Linguistic Criticism), speech representation (e.g., Bockting),  metaphor (e.g., Semino and Swindlehurst; Semino, “A Cognitive Stylistic Approach”,  Metaphor in Discourse), and conversational behaviour (e.g., Fanlo Piniés; Semino,  “Mind Style 25 Years On”). The potential role of patterns of deictic choices in the  projection of mind style has not received systematic attention, but Irene Bockting  has pointed out how the mind styles of the Compson brothers in Faulkner’s The  </page> <page sequence="4"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 421 Sound and the Fury are conveyed, in part, by peculiarities in the use of deixis in  their individual narratives. I will return to Boctking’s work after providing a brief  introduction to deixis.  Deixis The notion of “deixis,” which etymologically derives from the Greek word for  “pointing,” applies to linguistic expressions (e.g. “I,” “this,” “here,” “now”) that refer  to entities and spatial or temporal locations from a particular subjective position,  normally that of the producer of the text in the situational context in which the text  is being produced. John Lyons defines deixis as follows:  By deixis is meant the location and identification of persons, objects, events, processes  and activities being talked about, or referred to, in relation to the spatiotemporal context  created and sustained by the act of utterance and the participation in it, typically, of a single  speaker and at least one addressee.  (637) In face-to-face interaction, which Lyons describes as the “canonical situation of  utterance,” deictic expressions typically take the speaker’s position as their point  of anchorage, and hence can only be successfully interpreted with reference to that  position. This applies, for example, to the interpretation of “here” in the utterance,  “If you stand here you can see the top of the church tower.” In this utterance, “here”  refers to the specific point where the speaker is standing, and the addressee needs  to be aware of this position in order fully to interpret what the speaker is saying.  Deixis is often described as “egocentric” precisely because, typically, “the ego of  the encoder represents the center of orientation” (Rauh 12). This point of orientation  has also been referred to as the default “deictic centre,” “zero point,” or “origo”  (see Lyons; Bühler; Levinson).  Deixis involves a (subjective) distinction between what is perceived as  “proximal” to the deictic centre and what is perceived as “non-proximal” or “distal.”  This is clearly evident in what is arguably the most prototypical dimension of deixis,  namely space deixis. Space deixis involves references to locations in terms of their  perceived position in relation to the deictic centre. The main contrast, in present-day  English, is that between proximal deictic expressions such as “this” and “here,”  which refer to locations that are perceived as close to the deictic centre, and non- proximal expressions such as “that” and “there” which refer to locations that are  perceived as far from that position. The perception of proximity is subjective and  context-dependent. For example, “here” typically includes the speaker’s position  but can vary quite dramatically in terms of how wide an area it refers to around  that position. While in the example above “here” only refers to the few square  centimeters in which the speaker is standing, much larger areas are referred to  </page> <page sequence="5"> 422 Elena Semino as “here” in utterances such as “It doesn’t rain much here” or “We drive on the  left side of the road here.” Space deixis also include the use of the motion verbs  “come” and “go” to indicate, respectively, movement towards the deictic centre  and movement away from the deictic centre. In addition to space deixis, this essay will be concerned primarily with two  further deictic dimensions, namely time and person deixis. Time deixis involves  the expression of a contrast between “now” and “not-now” or “then” and includes  expressions such as “now,” “then,” “later,” “today,” “yesterday,” “tomorrow,” “ago.”  Tense contrasts are also deictic, as they grammaticalize “the relationship which  holds between the time of the situation that is being described and the temporal  zero-point of the deictic context” (Lyons 678). The temporal deictic use of “this”  and “that” in expressions such as “this month” or “that day” arguably involves a  metaphorical extension to time of the spatial distinction between “here” and “not- here/there” (see also Lenz). Person deixis, on the other hand,  involves references  to the roles of addresser and addressee in communication and includes, in English,  the first and second-person pronouns “I,” “we,” and “you.” In fact, the pronoun “I”  is one of the most prototypical cases of deictic expressions, as it normally refers to  whomever is currently speaking or writing, so that its referent changes with every  change of speaker/writer. Space, time, and person deixis are normally described  as the main types of deictic phenomena (e.g., Lyons; Fillmore; Levinson). The  linguistic expression of a range of further phenomena has also been described as  involving deictic contrasts. These include, for example, references to portions of  a text or utterance from the current point in the ongoing text or talk (“discourse  deixis”), references to the rank or social status of other people from the speaker’s/ writer’s own position in a family, institution, or society (“social deixis”), and the use  of expressions such as “this” and “that” to express emotional distance (“empathetic  deixis”) (see also Lyons; Fillmore; Levinson; Rauh ). While the speaker’s or writer’s here-and-now constitutes the unmarked deictic  centre, there are many instances and forms of communication where a different  position in space and time is adopted as the zero-point for the use of deictic  expressions. Consider, for example, the question, “Are you coming to the cinema  tonight?,” which may be uttered in a telephone conversation between two people  currently in their respective homes. The use of “come,” in this case, indicates  movement towards the location where the speaker expects to be later that day and  towards which s/he is hoping the addressee will also travel. This phenomenon,  which is known as “deictic projection” (Lyons; Levinson ), is well-recognized in  a variety of forms of communication but is particularly relevant for the study of  </page> <page sequence="6"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 423 deixis in fiction, where the deictic centre typically corresponds to the position of  a narrator or character within an imaginary situational context. In a classic early  study of deixis, Bühler introduced the notion of “deixis at phantasma” to capture  the use of deictic expressions to refer to elements of a situational context that is  different from the current communicative situation and not directly perceivable by  the listener or reader. Bühler says that in such cases: the narrator takes the listener into the realm of the memorable absent, or fully into the realm  of constructive imagination, treating him there to the same deictic words that he may see  and hear what is there to be seen and heard (and to be touched or perhaps even smelled  or tasted). Not with the outward eye, ear, etc. but with what, in contrast, is conventionally  called the “inner” or the “mind’s eye or ear in everyday language . . . .  (22) In other words, in fiction as well as in many other cases of deictic projection,  the use of deictic expressions does not rely on the addressee’s awareness of the  speaker’s position and perspective, but rather provides clues for the construction of  a subjective position within an imagined situational context in reference to which  the deictic expressions used in the text make sense (see also Green; Semino, “Deixis  and the Dynamics”). Indeed, deixis plays a central role in accounts of the textual  projection of point of view (e.g., Fowler, Linguistic Criticism; Short), as well as in  models of narrative comprehension that attempt to account for how readers imagine  text worlds by navigating through changes of time and place (e.g., Duchan et al.,  Emmott; Fauconnier; Werth; Gavins). The mental representations of situations  that we form as we read a narrative tend to be defined primarily in deictic terms,  whether they are labelled “mental spaces” (Fauconnier), “sub-worlds” (Werth), or  “contextual frames” (Emmott). More specifically, deictics are among the linguistic  expressions that may be used to indicate shifts from one mental space, sub-world,  or contextual frame to another (see also Gavins’s notion of “world switches”).  As I mentioned earlier, Bockting has discussed deixis in relation to the textual  projection of characters’ minds and personalities. She argues, for example, that, in  Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury, the impression of Benjy’s limited cognitive  abilities is reinforced by the fact that he does not seem able to engage in deictic  projection or, in other words, to understand others’ perspectives and points of  view. In contrast, the attribution of schizophrenia to Quentin is in part based on  stretches of text in which there is no stability of deictic centre, resulting in what  Bockting calls a “breakdown of the deictic system” (70). In the rest of the essay,  I discuss in detail the peculiar uses of deixis in Hughes’s “Wodwo” and Haddon’s  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and their implications for the  textual projection of the protagonists’ minds. </page> <page sequence="7"> 424 Elena Semino Deixis and The Poetic Persona’s Mind in   Ted Hughes’s “Wodwo” Ted Hughes’s poem “Wodwo” first appeared in 1967 as the last poem in the collection  of the same title.2 The title of the poem is derived from the Middle English poem  Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where wodwos are among the wild creatures  of the forest that are fought by the knight during his journey through the Wirrall.  Hughes himself described the first-person speaker in the poem as:  some sort of satyr or half-man or half-animal, half all kinds of elemental little things, just  a little larval being without shape or qualities who suddenly finds himself alive in this  world at any time.  (qtd. in Sagar, The Art of Ted Hughes 98)  Critics variously describe the wodwo as a “wood sprite” (Scigaj 128) or a  “proto-human” (Holmes 131), as representing the experience of the child, or the  poet’s way of exploring reality (Sagar, The Art of Ted Hughes 97, “Fourfold vision”  297; see also Bassnett 23). In my own reading of the poem, the poetic speaker is  a creature who has just made the transition to consciousness, which leads to the  question that opens the poem: “What am I?” Indeed, there is, broadly speaking,  consensus among the critics that the poem is concerned with identity, consciousness,  knowledge, freedom, and the relationship between the self and the world. Hughes’s  choice of the wodwo as the poem’s voice and protagonist is both sufficiently precise  and sufficiently elusive to thwart any attempt to approach the poem as a riddle,  but also allows readers to see the wodwo as potentially representing any conscious  creature who is preoccupied with its own uncertain identity and place in the world.  In what follows, I suggest that the use of deixis interacts with other aspects of the  poem in order to convey a sense of disorientation and lack of boundaries and to  create the impression of the workings of a mind that can be described as, in some  respects, primitive and very strongly self-focused. I begin with some general  comments on what I see as the most salient aspects of the poem, and then I focus  on deixis in more detail. In Reuven Tsur’s terms, understanding the poem involves “delayed” (as opposed  to “rapid”) categorization, as the wodwo cannot be straightforwardly identified  as a member of a pre-existing, familiar category: it seems able to fly, swim, and  move on land; in lines 6–8, it is not clear whether it dismembers and eats the frog,  or whether it is small enough to move inside the frog’s body; similarly, in lines  26–27, it is not clear whether it is on the ground or below ground when it comes  across what it describes as “roots / roots roots roots.” Readers may of course vary  in the extent to which they accept the impossibility of establishing precisely the  </page> <page sequence="8"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 425 characteristics of the wodwo, and in whether they experience this elusiveness as a  source of pleasure or frustration.  A number of linguistic characteristics of the poem are likely to contribute  to an overall impression of fast and erratic movement, uncertain boundaries,  and disorientation. The poem is written in highly irregular free verse: there are  no divisions into stanzas, no regularity in line lengths, no discernible metrical  pattern, no rhyme scheme, and many instances of enjambment (e.g., “have they  / seen me,” in lines 9–10). Punctuation is used sparingly in the first half of the  poem (primarily in the form of question marks) and disappears completely after  line 15. In addition, no capital letters are used in the final nine lines of the poem  except for the first-person singular pronoun “I.” This makes it difficult to establish  boundaries between different clauses and sentences, and contributes to a sense of  rapid and increasingly anxious, almost breathless, movement. Towards the end of the  poem, the grammatical structure of the wodwo’s monologue becomes increasingly  fragmented, so that it would not be possible simply to insert punctuation and capital  letters to produce a series of well-formed sentences (e.g., line 23: “till I get tired  that’s touching one wall of me”).  Although the poem consists of only 28 lines and 262 words, it contains 11  questions. The wodwo’s concern with its own identity is evident from the opening  question, “What am I?.” The same question occurs again in line 15 and is rephrased  as “Who am I” in line 3. In addition, the wodwo wonders about:   •  its shape and size in lines 20–21;   •  its name in lines 8–9 and 19;   •  the reasons for its actions and reactions in lines 6–8 and 15–17;   •  its status as “the first” and the existence of an owner in lines 19–20. Cumulatively, I would argue, the wodwo’s questions seem to suggest a transition from  lack of consciousness to consciousness, from instinctive to intentional behaviour.  This transition raises questions of identity and relationships that the wodwo cannot  answer. There are several references to lack of roots and physical ties in the poem  (lines 10–15, 26–27), which can be interpreted metaphorically as suggesting both  freedom and a lack of a clear sense of origin and belonging. The poem ends with  the decision to “go on looking” and no full stop, suggesting that the search for an  answer to the wodwo’s questions has not yet been successful but is continuing. </page> <page sequence="9"> 426 Elena Semino Deixis In The Poem In this section, I show how the poem has an unusually high frequency of deictic  expressions and that these expressions overwhelmingly express “proximal,” as  opposed to “distal,” relationships in terms of person, space, and time deixis. This,  I suggest, contributes to the impression of a mind that seems unable to go beyond  its own current subjective position in the here-and-now and to distinguish between  “here” and “there,” “now” and “then,” and “me” and a possible “you.”  To begin with person deixis, the poem contains 35 occurrences of the first- person singular pronouns “I” and “me” out of 262 words (26 instances of “I” and  9 instances of “me”). This corresponds to 13 percent of the words in the poem.  An automatic comparison between the poem and two larger corpora of fiction  confirms that this is an unusually high frequency of first-person singular pronouns.  I used the keyword tool within the online corpus-comparison software Wmatrix  to compare word frequencies in the poem with those in the “Imaginative Writing”  section of the British National Corpus Sampler (hereafter BNC Sampler), which  contains approximately 233,000 words. The output of the tool is a list of words  in the text under analysis, starting with those that are “overused” to the highest  level of statistical significance as opposed to the larger reference corpus. In corpus  linguistics, the words that are overused to a statistically significant extent in a  particular set of data as compared with a relevant larger corpus are known as “key  words.” An appropriate level of statistical significance for this kind of comparison  is 99 percent, which corresponds to p &lt; 0.01 and a log-likelihood value1 of 6.63  or above. The top four key words in the poem are: “am,” “I,” “roots,” “me.” In  each case, the result is statistically significant at 99.99 percent (p &lt; 0.0001). The  same four words were also found to be the most overused lexical items at the same  level of statistical significance in a second comparison of the poem with a smaller  40,000-word corpus of first-person fiction, which was originally compiled as part  of a project on speech, writing, and thought presentation in 20th century British  narratives (see Semino and Short). In contrast, the poem contains no instances  of second-person pronouns: although there are many interrogative structures, the  wodwo’s questions appear to be instances of self-address, with no explicit references  to a potential addressee. I now consider spatial and temporal deixis in turn. The poem contains 11  instances of proximal space deixis: three instances of “here,” five instances of  “this,” and three instances of “these.” Together, these account for approximately  four percent of the words in the poem. According to my keyword analysis, all three  words are overused in the poem (at a statistical significance level of 99 percent or  </page> <page sequence="10"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 427 above) as compared with both the Imaginative Writing section of the BNC Sampler  and the first-person fiction corpus. The poem contains only two potential instances of  distal deixis, namely “go” in line 21 and “that” in line 23. However, the fragmented  grammatical structure of line 23 makes it difficult to decide whether “that” is  used as a relative pronoun or as a demonstrative pronoun. Either way, it refers to  something that is in fact described as “touching” the wodwo’s body. Similarly, the  verb “go” in line 21, which refers to movement away from the speaker’s position,  is followed by “on this way,” where the use of the proximal space deixis “this”  indicates a focus on the wodwo’s current position. As for time deixis, the poem contains no temporal deictic adverbs, but the use  of tense is worthy of note. All finite verbs in the poem are in the simple present  tense (e.g., “am,” “find,” “suppose”), apart from one instance of the present perfect  (“have coincided”) and one present continuous (“that’s touching”). There are, in  other words, no instances of past tense verbs.  To summarize my observations so far, all instances of person and time deixis  in the poem express proximal deictic relationships. Of the 13 instances of space  deixis, 11 are proximal deictics; both the remaining two (“go” and “that”) refer  to entities and locations that are further described as being close to the speaker  (and, as I mentioned earlier, the deictic status of “that” in line 23 is not clear). Five  of the proximal person and space deictics (“I,” “me,” “here,” “this” and “these”)  are overused to a statistically significant extent as compared with two corpora of  contemporary fiction. In other words, the use of deixis in the poem suggests an  exclusive focus on the self and its immediate environment, with no clear evidence of  an opposition between “here” vs. “there” and “now” vs. “then,” nor of any attempt  to engage with other creatures as “you.”  There are, however, points in the poem where it can be argued that the use of  distal deixis would have been appropriate. Consider, for example, lines 1–3:  . . . Nosing here, turning leaves over Following a faint stain on the air to the river’s edge I enter water. . . . I regularly ask students in my classes whether the location referred to as “here” in  the first line of the extract is the same location in which the wodwo “enter(s) water”  in the third line of the quotation. The answer is always “no”: students tend to point  out that the intervening non-finite clauses suggest movement in both space and time,  so that the wodwo reaches the water at a different point from that referred to by  “here.” However, the use of a series of three non-finite clauses, with no temporal  conjunctions, makes it possible for the poetic speaker to provide a moment-by- </page> <page sequence="11"> 428 Elena Semino moment account of its movements without using distal deixis of space or time. This  makes it difficult to establish boundaries between different times and locations in  the series of actions described in the poem and contributes to the potential sense of  rapid, fluid, and partly confused movement that may also result from the infrequent  use of punctuation and from the lack of clear grammatical boundaries, especially in  the second half of the poem. Compare, for example, the following two (inevitably  inadequate) re-writings of the above three lines with the original version: After nosing there, turning leaves over And following a faint stain on the air to the river’s edge I enter water. I nosed there, turned leaves over, Followed a faint stain on the air to the river’s edge And now I enter water. Both alternative versions of Hughes’s original lines refer to the same sequence of  actions, but the temporal and spatial separation between them is made explicit by  the use of distal deixis of space (“there”) and time (“nosed,” “turned,” “followed”).  This results in the establishment of a distinction between here-and-now and there- and-then. In contrast, in Hughes’s poem the sequence of the wodwo’s actions is  presented as a series of here-and-now’s, some of which seem to be extremely brief,  as in the lines 21–22:   . . . if I go to the end on this way past these trees and past these trees According to my students’ responses to these lines (as well as my own), the two  instances of “these trees” in the quotation above refer to different groups of trees.  When invited to rephrase the second line of the above quotation in a way that they  perceive as less unusual, my students tend to suggest “past those trees and past  these trees.” This alternative version suggests that the wodwo perceives one group  of trees as close to its own position and the other as not close to its own position. In  the original version, however, the wodwo describes each set of trees from a position  from which they are perceived as close. This is likely to be interpreted as due to  the speed at which the wodwo travels, so that, by the time it utters (or thinks) the  second occurrence of “these trees,” it has moved from one location to another and  from being close to one group of trees to another. In other words, this extract from  the poem is consistent with the previous one in terms of the presentation of the  wodwo’s experience of the world as a rapid series of here-and-now’s, with no time,  and possibly no ability, to reflect on moments in time and locations in space that are  </page> <page sequence="12"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 429 perceived as “not here” and “not now”: the words of the wodwo’s monologue appear  to be entirely simultaneous with its immediate actions, movements, and reflections. Overall, my proposal is that the distinctive use of deixis in the poem contributes  to the projection of a mind that can be described as highly “egocentric” in the sense  that it is focused on the self in the here-and-now and does not seem to possess the  ability to distinguish between what is proximal as opposed to distal in space and  time, nor to perceive the other as a potential addressee. This is particularly consistent  with those readings of the poem where the wodwo is a “proto-human” or a partly  child-like creature and with my own interpretation of the wodwo as having just  acquired consciousness: the ability to conceive of places and times other than one’s  location in the present, and of others as possessing separate minds and perspectives  with which to engage, are complex and sophisticated human characteristics that  are acquired gradually in the course of individual development. Interestingly, in  line 25 the wodwo draws the following conclusion from its impression that when  it sits still “everything turns to watch” it:  . . . I suppose I am the exact centre.  Leonard M. Scigaj comments that as “‘exact centre’ of existence-for-the-self the  Wodwo is the generator, the creator of its own universe, moment by moment” (146).  I have suggested that the use of deixis in the poem contributes to this impression  of focus on the self and of “moment-by-moment cognition” (Scigaj 152). I will  now turn to the role of deixis in the projection of a different kind of “egocentric”  fictional mind in a novel. Deixis and The First-Person Narrator’s Mind in Mark  Haddon’s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  Mark Haddon’s novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (hereafter  The Curious Incident) appeared in 2003. It is part of growing trends in both “crossover  fiction” (it was published in two different covers for adults and children) and in the  fictional representation of characters with autistic-spectrum disorders (see Walsh;  Greenwell; Draaisma). The protagonist and first-person narrator, Christopher Boone,  is fifteen years old and is normally described (including on the book’s back cover)  as being autistic, specifically as being affected by Asperger’s syndrome, a form of  high-functioning autism. The novel has won several literary prizes (e.g., the 2003  Whitbread Book of the Year) and has been widely acclaimed for the moving and  “realistic” representation of the first-person narrator. Haddon himself has repeatedly  stated that he has no specialist knowledge of autistic-spectrum disorders and that  he did not intend to write a novel about autism or Asperger’s syndrome. Rather,  he states that: </page> <page sequence="13"> 430 Elena Semino if anything it’s a novel about difference, about being an outsider, about seeing the world in  a surprising and revealing way. it’s as much a novel about us as it is about christopher.   Indeed, the words “Asperger” and “autism” do not occur in the novel, but the  reader is provided with different sources of evidence that lead to the inference that  the narrator and protagonist has an autistic-spectrum disorder. Christopher describes  himself as “someone who has Behavioural Problems” (59) and goes to a special  school, alongside children with a range of disabilities. He does not tolerate physical  contact, is unusually fond of routine, has trouble sleeping at night, finds it difficult to  communicate with other people, and is exceptionally talented in math. Christopher  is also a very self-conscious narrator, who makes many meta-narrative and meta- linguistic comments (see also Walsh). He says that he has been encouraged to write  the novel by one of his school teachers but adds that, as he only likes factual writing,  he has decided to write an autobiographical account of his attempt to discover who  killed his next-door neighbour’s dog, Wellington. He also spells out that he finds  people “confusing” for two reasons: their tendency to communicate non-verbally  (e.g., via facial expressions) and their tendency to use metaphors, which Christopher  dismisses as “lies.” Indeed, Christopher also says that he never lies and that he is  unable to engage in small talk, or, as he puts it, “chatting.”  The language Christopher uses, both as a narrator and as a character, provides  the reader with additional clues to the distinctive way in which his mind works.  His vocabulary arguably displays both what Fowler calls “underlexicalization” and  “overlexicalization” (Linguistic Criticism). Christopher mostly uses a simpler and  more limited range of words than one would normally expect of an adolescent of his  age (for example, he does not know what “single” or “return” mean as descriptions  of train tickets) but displays unusual lexical sophistication when he discusses  the mathematical and scientific topics he is fond of. Similarly, the grammatical  structures he uses tend to be fairly simple, except for some of the stretches of text  where he deals with his favourite topics. As far as communication is concerned, it  becomes clear at various points that Christopher is not able to lie strategically, and  there are many occasions where, both as a narrator and as a character, he does not  seem able to judge what amount of information is appropriate for his addressees,  and hence he provides too much or too little detail (in Grice’s terms, Christopher  has trouble with the maxim of Quantity. See Semino, “Mind Style 25 Years On”).  All this points in the direction of a “Theory of Mind” problem, which is associated  with autistic-spectrum disorders: the inability to understand that others have mental  states that are different from one’s own and to attribute mental states to others on the  </page> <page sequence="14"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 431 basis of their behaviour (e.g., Baron-Cohen). Indeed, Christopher recounts how he  failed a standard ‘Theory of Mind’ task when he first started school (Haddon 145). Some of the characteristics I have mentioned are evident in the passage below.  Christopher’s next-door neighbour, Mrs. Shears, has called the police after finding  Christopher in her garden in the early hours of the morning holding her dead dog,  who has a garden fork sticking out of its body. In the extract, Christopher describes  the arrival of the police and his conversation with a policeman: Then the police arrived. I like the police. They have uniforms and numbers and you know  what they are meant to be doing. There was a policewoman and a policeman. The police- woman had a little hole in her tights on her left ankle and a red scratch in the middle of  the hole. The policeman had a big orange leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe which was  poking out from one side.  The policewoman put her arms round Mrs Shears and led her back towards the house. I lifted my head off the grass.  The policeman squatted down beside me and said, ‘Would you like to tell me what’s  going on here, young man?’  I sat up and said, ‘The dog is dead.’  ‘I’d got that far,’ he said.  I said, ‘I think someone killed the dog.’  ‘How old are you?’ he asked.  I replied, ‘I am 15 years and 3 months and 2 days.’  ‘And what, precisely, were you doing in the garden?’ he asked.  ‘I was holding the dog,’ I replied.  ‘And why were you holding the dog?’ he asked.  This was a difficult question.  (7) In the next section I show how some idiosyncrasies in Christopher’s use of  (especially person) deixis contribute to the representation of the distinctive ways  in which his mind works.  Deixis In The Novel In this section I begin by discussing the occasional failure, on Christopher’s part,  to use  anaphoric expressions where they would normally be expected. I then go  on to consider the use of person deixis in Christopher’s narrative. Anaphora is not, strictly speaking, a deictic phenomenon. However, there is no  clearcut boundary between anaphoric references to previously mentioned entities on  the one hand, and discourse deictic references to portions of the ongoing utterance  or text on the other (e.g., Levinson 85). Lyons, for example, states that “anaphora  rests ultimately on deixis,” as the use of anaphoric expressions depends, in part, on  how recently a particular referent has been mentioned, and “recency of mention is  itself a deictically based notion” (671). </page> <page sequence="15"> 432 Elena Semino There are occasions in The Curious Incident where Christopher uses full noun  phrases where anaphoric expressions would normally have been more appropriate.  Consider the extract below, which is a description of the ticket hall of a railway  station:  And there was a long desk at the other side of the big room and a window on the desk and  there was a man standing in front of the window and there was a man behind the window,  and I said to the man behind the window, ‘I want to go to London.’  (188)  The vocabulary used by Christopher in this extract is simpler and more generic  than one may expect of a fifteen-year-old: expressions such as “big room” and  “man behind the window” are used to describe entities for which more specific  descriptions exist, such as “station foyer”  and “ticket seller.” This potentially creates  an effect that has been discussed both in stylistics and narratology, whereby readers  may initially have difficulties recognizing a situation they are in fact familiar with  (e.g., Fowler, Linguistic Criticism; Margolin). The grammatical structure of the  sentence quoted above is also striking in its simplicity: the sentence consists of  four clauses linked by “and.” This type of structure is more typical of speech than  writing and tends to be used in fiction to create the impression of child-like minds,  as, for example, Benjy’s in The Sound and the Fury  (e.g., Leech and Short 165).  In addition, Christopher’s description contains much unnecessary repetition, as  he repeats whole noun phrases where an anaphoric expression would normally be  used. For example, the third instance of “window” in the extract above could have  been replaced by “it” and the second instance of “man behind the window” could  have been replaced by “him” or “the latter/second man.” This kind of phenomenon  does not occur systematically throughout the novel, but, where it does occur, it  gives Christopher’s prose a rather laboured feel and reinforces the impression of his  sense of alienation and processing difficulties in environments that would normally  be expected to be familiar to a fifteen-year-old. The most systematic and idiosyncratic patterns in the use of deixis in the  novel, however, concern person deixis. A keyword analysis reveals that first-person  singular pronouns are overused in the novel, while first-person plural pronouns are  underused. More specifically, a comparison between the novel and the Imaginative  Writing section of the BNC Sampler conducted by means of the Wmatrix online  tool revealed that the subject pronoun “I” is the second top key word in the novel  (after “and”): it occurs over 2,000 times in the approximately 62,000 word contained  in novel. This result is statistically significant at 99.99 percent (p &lt;  0.0001). Both  “me” and “my” were also found to be overused in the same comparison, respectively  at 99.99 percent (p &lt;  0.0001) and 99 percent significance (p &lt; 0.01).  </page> <page sequence="16"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 433 It could be objected that the high frequency of first-person pronouns in  comparison with the Imaginative Writing section of the BNC Sampler could  simply be due to the fact that The Curious Incident is a first-person narrative.  However, “I” was revealed to be the third top key word even when the novel was  compared with the 40,000-word corpus of first-person 20th century fiction created  as part of the project discussed in Semino and Short. Even in this case, the level of  significance was 99.99 percent (p &lt;  0.0001). “My” was also found to be overused  in this second comparison, at a 99 percent level of significance (p &lt; 0.01). In  other words, the frequency of first-person singular pronouns in Haddon’s novel is  unusually high, even as compared with other examples of first-person fiction. This  applies particularly clearly to the subject pronoun “I.” I would argue that this reflects  Christopher’s tendency to be unusually focused on himself, and, more specifically,  his own actions and thoughts, which may contribute to the impression that he has  an autistic-spectrum disorder. In addition, his use of plural first-person pronouns  suggests some degree of alienation from others. The comparison between The Curious Incident and the Imaginative Writing  section of the BNC Sampler revealed that the pronoun “we” is the 23rd most underused  word: it is used unusually infrequently in the novel, as compared with the reference  corpus, at a level of significance of 99.99 percent (p &lt;  0.0001). The corresponding  object pronoun “us” and possessive determiner “our” are also underused, at a level  of significance of 99.9 percent (p &lt; 0.001). “We”  and “our” were also found to be  underused when the novel was compared with the first-person fiction corpus, at a  level of significance of 99 percent (p &lt; 0.01). This could be taken as an indication  that Christopher’s sense of commonality with others is less evident in the novel  than is the case in other fictional texts. An examination of a concordance of “we” in the novel revealed a further relevant  pattern in Christopher’s use of this pronoun. Christopher almost exclusively uses  “we” as the subject of  verbs indicating what Halliday (Functional Grammar) calls  “material processes,” namely verbs evoking physical actions, such as “we drove  off,” “we went for a walk.” Conversely, Christopher does not use expressions such  as “we felt,” “we decided,” “we thought”: he does not use “we” as the subject of  verbs indicating what Halliday (Functional Grammar) calls “mental processes,”  namely verbs evoking cognitive and emotional states and changes. The only  exception to this pattern are cases of the “generic” use of “we” to refer to people  generally, which Christopher primarily employs when discussing knowledge about  scientific topics, as in “because when we look up into the sky at night there will be  no darkness.” In contrast, the first-person fiction corpus (which, it should be noted,  </page> <page sequence="17"> 434 Elena Semino is smaller in terms of word count than The Curious Incident) contains expressions  such as: “But we still love the place for itself,” “the experience we had shared,” “I  think we liked it that way because both of us had a feeling that the meetings should  be something of a secret.” In Palmer’s terms, these kinds of expressions are one of  the textual indicators of “intermentality,” the attribution of shared internal states  to groups consisting of more than one person, or, in this case, of groups consisting  of the speaker/narrator and at least one other person (Fictional Minds). The fact  that this form of intermentality does not seem to occur in Christopher’s narrative  can be seen as one of the ways in which the novel suggests that Christopher has  a “Theory of Mind” problem: he does not tend to talk about shared mental states  with others because he does not have a fully developed ability to understand the  workings of others’ minds. In this context, the few occasions in which Christopher suggests some form  of intermental activity involving himself and another character are particularly  foregrounded. The following example occurs just after Christopher has been  collected by his father from the police station where he was taken after hitting the  policeman who appears in the extract I quoted above. I stepped outside. Father was standing in the corridor. He held up his right hand and spread  his fingers out in a fan. I held up my left hand and spread my fingers out in a fan and we  made our fingers and thumbs touch each other. We do this because sometimes Father wants  to give me a hug, but I do not like hugging people, so we do this instead, and it means that  he loves me.  (21) Here Christopher explains his own and his father’s behaviour in terms of a shared  understanding of each others’ preferences and emotions (cf. “we do it because”).  However, this behaviour is clearly not the spontaneous outcome of mutual  understanding, but rather the result of an explicit agreement on how to achieve  some degree of physical intimacy with Christopher in spite of his aversion to  bodily contact. A further set of comparisons by means of the keyword tool in Wmatrix was  carried out in order to exclude the possibility that the quantitative results I have  presented were unduly influenced by the presence of other characters’ voices within  Christopher’s narrative. I created an electronic version of the novel which excluded  all instances of direct speech presentation of utterances produced by characters  other than Christopher himself. I then repeated the comparisons mentioned above.  All results were confirmed as statistically significant at similar levels, with the  exception of “me,” which was not found to be overused in the “Christopher only”  version of the novel as compared with the Imaginative Writing section of the BNC  </page> <page sequence="18"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 435 sampler. In fact, as suggested earlier, “me” was not found to be overused in the  complete novel as compared with the first-person fiction corpus even in my first  set of comparisons, in contrast with “I” and “my,” which turn out to be overused  in all the comparisons I have conducted. This suggests that Christopher tends to  talk unusually frequently about what he does and thinks, rather than about how  other people affect him.  The results obtained when comparing the “Christopher only” version with the  two reference corpora revealed a further potentially relevant pattern in Christopher’s  use of person deixis that was not equally prominent when considering the novel as  a whole. This pattern concerns the use of second-person pronouns in The Curious  Incident. The reflexive second-person pronoun “yourself” is underused in the whole  novel as compared with the Imaginative Writing section of the BNC Sampler, at a  level of statistical significance of 99 percent (p &lt; 0.01), while “you” is underused  in the whole novel as compared with the first-person fiction corpus at a level of  statistical significance of 99.99 percent (p &lt; 0.0001). When the same comparisons  were carried out with the “Christopher only” version of the novel, the underuse of  second-person pronouns turned out to be more marked. The comparison with the  Imaginative Writing section of the BNC sampler revealed that “you,” “your” and  “yourself” are underused, at a level of statistical significance of 99.99 percent for  “you” and “your” (p &lt; 0.0001), and 99 percent for “yourself” (p &lt; 0.01). “You” and  “your” were also found to be underused in the “Christopher only” version of the novel  as compared with the first-person fiction corpus, at a level of statistical significance  of 99 percent (p &lt; 0.01). In other words, Christopher’s narrative, including his direct  speech, seem to contain an unusually low frequency of references to an addressee.  An examination of the concordances for “you” and “your” in the “Christopher  only” version of the novel provides further insights into Christopher’s distinctive  use of second-person pronouns. The vast majority of Christopher’s uses of “you”  and “your” occur in narration rather than direct speech and are best described as  instances of the “generic” use of the second-person pronoun to refer to people in  general, as I noted above in relation to some instances of “we.” This is the case, for  example, in “It was a clear night and you could see the Milky Way,” and “in this  experiment you put your head in a clamp.” Only 18 instances of “you” (out of a  total of 321) and one instance of “your” (out of 35) occur in direct speech reports  of Christopher’s utterances, and hence function as deictic references to another  participant in communication (e.g., “I said, ‘But  you  can’t cook.’”). In other  words, most of the utterances that Christopher attributes to himself do not include  deictic references to his addressee(s) by means of second-person pronouns, as he  </page> <page sequence="19"> 436 Elena Semino does not tend to comment on or inquire about his interlocutors. This may further  contribute to the impression that he is unusually self-focused and that he has little  awareness of others’ mental states.  Overall, I would argue that, in The Curious Incident, the combination of  overuse of singular first-person pronouns and underuse of both plural first-person  pronouns and second-person pronouns contributes to create an impression of the  particular kind of egocentricity that characterizes Christopher. He is a loner and  tends to be content in his own company. He also has difficulties understanding the  mental states of others and seldom feels a sense of affinity and commonality with  them. This is consistent with the attribution to Christopher of a high-functioning  autistic-spectrum disorder such as Asperger’s syndrome. Conclusion In this essay, I have suggested that idiosyncratic patterns in the use of deixis can be  exploited in literature to contribute to the impression of fictional minds that work in  “unorthodox”  or “nonstandard” ways. The notion of “egocentricity,” which captures  the fact that the default deictic centre is the speaker’s or writer’s current position,  can be applied in its more general, non-technical sense to the effects of unusually  frequent occurrences of proximal deictics in first-person fiction. In both of the texts  I have discussed, the speaker/narrator can be described as strikingly self-focused  and as not fully able to appreciate the minds and perspectives of others. However,  the discussion has also shown that the particular peculiarities in the use of deictic  expressions in individual texts can be associated with further, more specific effects,  such as the wodwo’s exclusive concentration on the here-and-now, which does  not apply to the narrator in The Curious Incident. I have also shown how the use  of corpus-based methods to compare individual texts with relevant larger corpora  can provide quantitative support for claims about unusual frequencies of particular  linguistic features, which would otherwise lack a solid empirical foundation. Notes 1  The log-likelihood ratio is a widely used method for calculating statistical  significance in corpus linguistics, as it does not assume normal distribution (see  Dunning 1993). In the output of the Wmatrix keyword tool statistical significance  is expressed in terms of log-likelihood values. In the rest of this article, I will  translate  the relevant values into percentages and probability values (p-values),  as these have wider currency as expressions of degrees of statistical significance. 2  I regret that I was unsuccessful in gaining permission to reproduce the poem  in full, as the details of my analysis are best appreciated if the reader has access  </page> <page sequence="20"> Deixis and Fictional Minds 437 to the complete text.
