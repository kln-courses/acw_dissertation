<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERCOMMUNICATIONS, DISTANCE, AND GEOGRAPHICAL THEORY* BY THOMAS FALK Stockholm School of Economics AND RONALD ABLER The Pennsylvania State University ABSTRACT. Each movement technology alters the effective distances among places by changing the effort required to move things, people, and information among those places. Intercommunications media (postal, telegraph, telephone, tel- ex, and computer-mediated techniques) have had greater im- pacts on effort distances than any other movement technol- ogy. Because they have not heretofore been examined carefully, the alterations of distance produced by intercommunications media have rarely been incorporated into geographical think- ing. Geographical theory and analysis are impoverished by the failure of geographers to include the new ideas about distance and spatial interaction produced in intercommunications in their theory and their analytical models. Incorporating such ideas would enrich the discipline by making some of its most basic concepts more comprehensive and therefore more pow- erful. Daniel Bell (1973) characterized the United States as a post-industrial society in recognition of the growing social and economic importance of service occupations and industries. There is much that suggests that advanced nations have now gone well beyond Bell's post-industrial stage. The salient characteristics of national life today are information-based social, economic, and policital activities, and unprecedented trans- portation and information flows. All places and regions of the world have come to depend on orderly and continuous flows of goods, people, and energy from elsewhere. This global interde- pendence is governed by information flows through intercommunications media. The entire world system has, therefore, become especially dependent on flows of information. Technology, distance, and theory Each technology of movement alters the effec- tive distance among places by changing the ef- fort needed to move things, people, and informa- tion among those places. In geographical theory, distance variables have mostly been concerned with the movement of goods or people. Trans- portation has long been recognized as a critical locational factor for individual entrepreneurs and for the overall organization of society. A rich literature exists on the relationships be- tween transportation on the one hand, and eco- nomic and settlement geography on the other. Virtually no facet of transportation remains un- explored. In contrast, the role of intercommuni- cations media (postal, telegraph, telephone, tel- ex, and advanced computer-mediated channels) has not been incorporated into geographical thinking. Intercommunications is a fundamental spatial process, and geographical theory and analysis are improverished by the failure hereto- fore to incorporate ideas about distance that arise as a consequence of intercommunications. It is paradoxical that we have extensive knowledge of the geographical effects produced by developments in transportation, and scarcely no knowledge about geographical effects caused by intercommunications media. Those media have been instrumental in creating the new world in which information and information flows are major elements of social, economic, and political geography. Intercommunications media have had great impacts on effective distances and therefore on spatial interaction. Despite these impacts, inter- communications media have not been subjected to geographical analysis. We know little about * The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation. 59</page><page sequence="2">the alterations of distance produced by inter- communications technologies. We know little about how such alterations have affected the routine operations of social organizations, busi- ness firms, and government agencies. Because they have not been examined carefully, the alter- ations of distance produced by intercommunica- tions media have rarely been incorporated into geographical theory. This paper outlines some ways that intercom- munications activities can be incorporated into geographical thinking, and some ways that new ideas about distance created by intercommuni- cations technologies can be incorporated into geographical theory. Intercommunications versus transportation Empirical and theoretical analyses of the effects of transportation media have led to the formula- tion of productive geographical theory. The mo- dels that can be derived from theory and empiri- cal investigation have in turn made it possible to predict the impacts of changes in the locations of transportation routes. We can also predict the effects of constructing new routes and the ef- fects of eliminating existing transportation links. Intellectual investment in transportation re- search has paid important theoretical and practi- cal dividends. A geographical account of the development and diffusion of intercommunications technol- ogies would be a start toward similar progress in the realm of communications. It would help cre- ate the new theoretical formulations that will be required for measuring and predicting the geo- graphical effects of intercommunications activi- ties. Most current discussions of the social role of intercommunications technology are futuris- tic. Their authors are unfamiliar with intercom- munications technology and they are insensitive to the economic, institutional, and cultural ob- stacles that must be overcome to achieve the visions of the future they describe. Moreover, current visions foresee only positive effects of advances in communications. The possibility that intercommunications technologies might be put to nefarious uses is rarely considered. Such assumptions have not been put to the test of careful historical analysis. Uncritical and opti- mistic views of the intercommunications future are poor foundations for decision making and scholarship. Yet they will be used that way in the absence of better information. An important question is whether transporta- tion and intercommunications are competitive, complementary, or synergistic; a question which in turn is closely linked to the current concern regarding possible tradeoffs between intercom- munications and transportation. (See, e.g., Abler, 1975a; Engstr6m et al., 1977; Nilles et al,, 1976; Reid, 1977; de Sola Pool, 1977.) At one extreme, one could argue that intercommunica- tions and transportation are alternative tech- niques for accomplishing a large number of tasks, and that they compete to do so. At the other extreme, one could argue that the two technologies stimulate each other, that more transportation is consumed when intercommuni- cations media are available than when they are not available, and vice versa. Alternatively, the two technologies can be viewed as complemen- tary systems, with few opportunities to substi- tute for each other. Although there is a great deal of contemporary interest in this question, there has been little research on the topic. In a classic article Edward Ullman (1956) ar- gues that the prerequisites for human spatial in- teraction are complementarity between places (i.e., a supply-demand relationship) and trans- ferability (i.e., a transportation link); interaction is modified by intervening opportunities. Ullman is clearly thinking of interaction in terms of movement of people or goods. It could be argued that no such interaction between places would occur unless information could be passed be- tween places. It would thus be useful to extend Ullman's framework to include information as a critical element of complementarity. Concepts of distance Geography was defined as a "discipline in dis- tance" by J. Wreford Watson (1955). William Bunge (1962) concluded in his treatise on theo- retical geography that: The central problem in geography is to place interacting objects as near to each other as possible, when a definition of distance is cho- sen that minimizes movements (p. 196). Watson and Bunge wrote implicitly and explicit- ly about the ways transportation and communi- cations technologies could create new kinds of distances that were defined in terms of compara- tive accessibility rather than in terms of the num- 60</page><page sequence="3">ber of miles separating places. The concept of time-space convergence suggested by Donald Janelle (1968) provided a means of measuring the effects of transportation innovations on dis- tance. Time-space convergence is the average rate at which the time needed to move goods or people between two places decreases. The con- cept of time-space convergence has led others to suggest related ideas such as cost-space conver- gence and time- and cost-space divergence (Abler, 1975b; see also Forer, 1978). Concepts of convergence and divergence have in turn given rise to ideas of absolute and relative distances. Absolute distances have been defined as those that are essentially invariant over time, such as the number of miles or kilometers sepa- rating two places. Relative distances have been referred to as those kinds of distances that do vary over time, such as the number of minutes needed to move between two places. Elapsed time can be decreased by speedier transporta- tion or increased by growing congestion (Abler et al., 1971). These definitions of absolute and relative dis- tance are ambiguous and imprecise. Miles and kilometers are indeed absolute units of measure- ment. Their lenghts are rigorously defined and stable over time. Minutes fall into the same cate- gory, for the length of a minute is invariant. Yet the terminology noted above would designate the number of kilometers separating two places as an absolute distance because it is invariant. On the other hand, the number of minutes sepa- rating two places would be called a relative dis- tance because the number can vary with trans- portation technology and other conditions. To further complicate matters, such absolute units of distance are lumped indiscriminantly with units of distance measurement that do vary over time, such as the distance purchasing power of a dollar. A more precise terminology is suggested here to refer to distance units: Globe distances are measured by counting the number of abstract units of length between places. Globe distances are customarily counted in units such as miles and kilometers. They are, for practical purposes, invariant over time. Effort distances are measured by counting the number of effort units consumed in moving from one place to another. Effort distances can be changed by technology, regulatory policies, and political events. Dollars expended, quantities of gasoline consumed, or the perceived stress en- countered in negotiating a route are examples of effort distances. The number of minutes needed to move between two places would also be an effort distance, because it does vary. The most important characteristic of effort distances is that the number of distance units consumed in moving between places changes from time to time with technology and other conditions. Some examples of measurements that could yield effort distances are various types of cost isolines employed in Weberian locational analy- sis (see, e.g., Smith, 1971; Lindberg, 1951), mo- dels for location multiple facilities (e.g., Torn- qvist, 1963; cf. T6rnqvist et al., 1971), and the use of isochrones to determine the location of public facilities (see, e.g., Godlund, 1961). Metaphorical distances are measured by counting the number of contacts between places during a given time period. The "social dis- tances" among a set of places, for example, would be measured by counting the frequency of social contacts among the places. Some exam- ples of measurement that could yield metaphori- cal distances are a study of the effects of a politi- cal and linguistic boundary on communications flows in Canada (McKay, 1958), an analysis of political integration in East Africa (Soja, 1968), and the extensive work on mental maps (Gould and White, 1974). Other examples are a study of Vdisteras' contacts with the rest of Sweden (Dahl, 1954), map transformations based on mi- gration data (Higerstrand, 1957), and calcula- tions of regional variations in contact possibili- ties, cartographically described as the "contact landscape" of Sweden (Thrnqvist, 1973). The study headed by Gunnar Tornqvist concerning a possible bridge or tunnel between Sweden and Denmark is rich with examples of metaphorical distance measures (see, SOU 1978:20 and T$rnqvist, 1979). Yet other examples of meta- phorical distances are to be found in a number of studies using telephone calls and newspaper cir- culation to delimit central place hinterlands. A classic example is the delimitation by Howard Green (1955) of the metropolitan hinterlands of Boston and New York. Metaphorical distances are usually functional- ly related to effort distances. For example, a metaphorical distance between two places mea- sured as the frequency of shopping trips is large- ly the result of a prevailing effort distance such as transport time or transport cost. Intercommu- 61</page><page sequence="4">nications services have created many new effort distances; they often differ greatly from the globe distances from which they were trans- formed. Complicated sets of metaphorical dis- tances result, for spatial interaction processes are governed more by effort distances among places than by globe distances. Various relationships among globe, effort, and metaphorical distances create many distance paradoxes. Whereas two places may be in close proximity in globe distance, they may be far apart in terms of effort or metaphorical dis- tances. A good example would be East and West Berlin. In terms of globe distances the two parts of the city are close to one another; they are far apart in terms of social contacts or possible eco- nomic transactions. Another example of this paradox could be found by contrasting social relationships in urban and rural areas. In urban high-rise apartment complexes globe distances between families are small, but social contacts are often few or nonexistent. In rural areas globe distances between farms can be large, but meta- phorical distances (in terms of social contacts) are often short. Distance in geographical theory The term "theory" is used rather loosely by geographers. A catalog of concepts that have been described as being theoretical in the geo- graphical literature would certainly include works on industrial location, central places, mi- gration, transportation, and diffusion of innova- tions. At a more fundamental level than these specific examples, all theoretical thinking in ge- ography is derived from a concern with the loca- tions of phenomena and the distances separating them. All theoretical thinking is additionally based on principles of least effort. At this funda- mental level, the ways in which distance is mea- sured and the means by which distance can be overcome are critical elements of theoretical structures in geography. Geographical theory is created inductively far more often than deductively. For example, geog- raphers observed the ways new transportation and communications innovations affected spatial interaction patterns and derived new ideas and theories from such observations. Friedrich Rat- zel (1929) developed most of the discipline's ba- sic ideas about transportation only after a full century of unparalleled improvements in trans- portation. The friction of distance is the fundamental axiom of all geographical theory. Without sig- nificant frictions or costs of overcoming dis- tance, geographical theory makes as little sense as economic theory makes in the absence of the assumption of scarcity. Many theoretical formu- lations in geography produce insights by con- trasting different kinds of distances. The gravity model, for example, compares globe distances with metaphorical distances among places. The general relationship between globe distances and metaphorical distances (interaction frequency) among all the places documents a basic relation- ship between interaction and globe distance; re- siduals identify pairs of places with interaction intensities greater or less than would be predict- ed by the basic interaction relationship. (See, e.g., Claeson, 1964.) Similarly, central place the- ory is a general statement of the relationship between the globe distances and globe azimuths separating different trade centers of different sizes on the one hand, and the metaphorical or effort distances separating the places on the oth- er. In certain restricted ways, intercommunica- tions media can completely eliminate variations in effort distances among places located at wide- ly different globe distances from each other. A frictionless set of effort distances can in turn produce unusual sets of metaphorical distances among the places. Individuals and groups re- spond to effort distances, not to globe distances, in deciding whether to engage in specific spatial interactions. The most familiar example of such an effort distance is that created by postal rates for domestic mail. Charging the same fee for a letter that is going across the street as is charged for a letter being sent across the nation has the effect of eliminating economic distances for mail service. All places, regardless of their globe dis- tances from each other, are the same economic distance apart. Therefore metaphorical dis- tances (that is, the relative frequencies of con- tacts among the places) could easily become in- dependent of globe or effort distances. Distance in location theory All geographical theories assume that some costs are necessary to overcome distance. Location theory is similar to geographical theory in gener- 62</page><page sequence="5">al; it depends conceptually on the axioms that distance exists as a friction and that the friction can be measured in some way. Orthodox indus- trial location theory is a union of concepts of the friction of distance and classical economic the- ory. It can justifiably be described as economic determinism based on assumptions of economic man. The underlying assumption of classical lo- cation studies is that the geographic arrangement of economic activities is created by enterpre- neurs' searches for least cost locations in an environment where costs vary from place to place. Classical location studies focused largely on optimal locations for single plants or installa- tions. A typical nineteenth century firm might have housed its factory, warehouse, sales office, and business headquarters under a single roof. In- creasingly, individual plants and offices are sin- gle elements of complex multipurpose firms. With the current state of communications tech- nology in advanced nations, distant places can interact as if they were close to each other. Shrinking distances give individuals and organi- zations more locational options than they had when movement technologies were less effi- cient. Individuals have greater freedom to sepa- rate places of work, residence, and recreation (Falk, 1976, 1978). Modern communications technologies have facilitated a geographical sep- aration of organizations or parts of organiza- tions; business firms and government agencies can disperse their operations over greater areas without sacrificing central control. The capaci- ties for regional, national, and international co- operation and coordination have increased, as have the abilities to exercise control at a dis- tance. Modern firms often consist of factories, ware- houses, sales centers, and information process- ing facilities scattered throughout a nation, sev- eral nations, or the entire world. The work at all units can be coordinated and controlled via in- terpersonal communications media, regardless of their locations. The needs and geographical organization of such a multilocational corpora- tion as a whole may be dominant locational cri- teria, even with respect to the locations of indi- vidual facilities. Beyond the firm with a narrow line of business, conglomerates are even more dependent on intercommunications technology; their numerous diverse components preclude the standardized operating procedures characteris- tic of single-product or single-service firms. A more comprehensive location theory is required to explain the locational behavior of modern cor- porations and their constituent parts. In recent years systems theoretic approaches to locational behavior have been developed which are more attuned to current ideas about distance, and more applicable to current ways of organizing and managing industrial, commercial, and bureaucratic systems. In recognition of the ever increasing interdependencies among the ur- ban and economic systems of advanced nations, more attention has been paid to the spatial struc- ture of organizations and to the link between organizational and systems theory on the one hand, and urban and locational analysis on the other (see, e.g., Ahnstr6m, 1973; Godlund, 1972; Nordstr6m, 1971; Pred, 1974, 1975, 1976; Wairneryd, 1968). Likewise, studies concerning organizational behavior and industrial location have been a major concern of the Commission on Industrial Systems of the International Geo- graphical Union (see, e.g., Hamilton, 1974; Hamilton and Linge, 1979). The systems theoretic approaches to industri- al location theory have helped to produce a deeper understanding of current locational be- havior. Yet these approaches are not as fruitful as they could be, in that as currently formulated, distance is usually included within them only in the form of globe distances or effort distances (usually in terms of costs). The power of these thoretical structures would be greatly enhanced were they revised to include metaphorical dis- tances in their axioms. Promising work in this direction has begun in the studies of whether intercommunications me- dia might substitute for transportation currently undertaken for face-to-face communication (see, e.g., Goddard and Pye, 1977; Goddard, 1979; Pye, 1979; for a review of the potential of com- puter conferencing see Hiltz and Turoff, 1978; Johansen et al., 1979). Rapid rises in transporta- tion costs would be powerful incentives for en- trepreneurs to develop acceptable communica- tions substitutes, and for customers to use them. Understanding past transportation-intercommu- nication tradeoffs is expecially important in view of current curiosity about the feasibility and ac- ceptability of communications tradeoffs for transportation (de Sola Pool, 1977). Until relatively recently, there were few at- tempts to apply locational analysis to communi- 63</page><page sequence="6">cations activities. Furthermore, communica- tions facilities and information resources were rarely recognized as important factors influenc- ing location. During the last fifteen years schol- ars have come to realize the importance of infor- mation and intercommunications as factors in- fluencing the location of economic activities. They have also recognized the growing geo- graphical importance of information industries and occupations themselves. One early focus of such research was the eastern United States. In Metropolis 1985, Raymond Vernon (1963) recog- nized the importance of abundant information resources as external economies for knowledge- dependent industries in New York City. Jean Gottmann (1961) pursued similar ideas in Mega- lopolis and subsequent work (1966). Richard Meier (1962) and Melvin Webber (1963, 1964) discussed the relationship between urban devel- opment and human communications. Those ear- lier concerns have been further refined in Swe- den by Folke Kristensson (1967) and Bertil Thorngren (1967, 1972). Thorngren and T6rn- qvist pioneered the study of the role of informa- tion availability in urban environments. Thorn- gren (1970a, 1970b, 1971) analyzed the interper- sonal contact systems of various Swedish busi- ness and government organizations and T6rn- qvist (1970, 1973, 1974) studied contact systems and regional development in Sweden. Any social group, business firm, or govern- ment agency creates a matrix of communications flows in its day-to-day operations. Each of these matrices is made up by smaller matrices which in turn are nested within larger matrices. The work by Torsten Higerstrand (1970) and followers (cf., Pred, 1977) on the time and space dimen- sions of human spatial behavior provides a con- ceptual framework for investigating the various submatrices and the total information matrix that constitutes a society. Intercommunications networks are, by their natures, large scale integrated mechanisms in which each element functions as part of the whole. As does the modern multiunit firm or agency, intercommunications media, by their very natures, have had to operate as integrated systems for well over a century. Thus it is highly likely that significant refinements in industrial location theory and in our understanding of in- tercommunications systems will emerge from historical studies of the development and diffu- sion of intercommunications media. Distance in communications theory Distances - whether globe distances, effort dis- tances, or metaphorical distances - have rarely been incorporated into communications theory which usually focuses on the effects of commu- nications processes within and among groups of people. Contemporary discussions have diverse disciplinary origins, including, among others, Speech-Communications, Journalism, Political Science, and a diversity of perspectives interest- ed in public opinion formation and decision mak- ing. (For recent discussions of communications theory see, e.g., Golding and Murdock, 1978; Carey, 1978; Kepplinger, 1979.)Models of com- munications processes are often is based on ana- logs of electromechanical communications sys- tems such as radio transmitters and receivers. In such schemes, a message is encoded, transmit- ted, disturbed by one or more noise sources, received, and decoded. Distance is not incorpo- rated as an explicit variable. Moreover, me- chanical analogs imply that communication is a one-way process, and that communication con- sists of exchanges of information. Neither of these assumptions withstands close scrutiny from a geographical perspective. All forms of intercommunication must be influenced to some degree by the distances separating com- municating parties or groups. Intercommunica- tions consist of two-way askings and tellings rather than one-way information sendings. Inter- communication is most emphatically not ex- change. If we tell you something we do not lose it. If we give you something we normally part with it. "Exchange" implies sending or giving with loss. Intercommunication is sharing with- out loss. On the contrary, the act of intercommu- nication usually leaves all parties richer. The recipients of a telling or asking have more infor- mation than they had before; the originators have their knowledge reinforced by sharing it with others. Verbalizing an idea or a question in order to share it with others is an inherently clarifying and reinforcing process. The theory of information formulated by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver (1949) is of little geographical importance. Information theory is concerned with the information transmission capacities of finite communications channels. The informa- tion measure employed in such analyses can be specified mathematically, but it is semantically meaningless. Our major concern is the practical meaning that new mechanisms for sharing mean- 64</page><page sequence="7">ingful information over long distances have had for individuals, groups, and institutions. Also of major concern is the ways new ideas about dis- tance created by intercommunications media have entered geographical thinking. The "infor- mation" incorporated in information theory is irrelevant to such concerns. A body of less rigorous theory that is geo- graphically provocative is the literature devoted to the role of intercommunications in human af- fairs. Herbert Spencer (1910) argued that inter- communications media were the means by which social control was exercised, and thus were analogous to the nervous system of the human body. Spencer felt that the telegraph gave the societies of his day a coordinating ca- pacity superior to that of earlier times. Similar ideas appear in Friedrich Ratzel's work. (See, e.g., Ratzel, 1929; cf, Hiickel, 1906, 1907.) He characterized transportation and communication (Verkehr) as the "master of space" (Raumibewiiltiger). Charles H. Cooley (1894) distinguished two "mechanisms of communica- tion," one for material communication (trans- portation) and one for psychical communication. The latter were postal services, telegraphs, and telephones. Harold Innis (1950, 1964) explored the relationships of large scale political organiza- tion to communications media. One of Innis' students, Marshall McLuhan (1966), sparked a renaissance of interest in communications media in the 1960s by transforming Innis' ideas into a general theory of culture. Perhaps the most use- ful of the modern general theories about the role of communications in society is that formulated by Colin Cherry (1978). It focuses clearly on the organizing power inherent in the intercommuni- cations media, although the power to organize over distances is usually more implicit than ex- plicit. The ideas reviewed above offer insights into the ways people employ intercommunications media. Even the highly anthropomorphic analo- gies used by early sociologists and geographers are quite compatible with current systems theo- retic approaches. Accordingly, some of these ideas would be departure points for an investiga- tion of the role of distance in human affairs and in geographical theory. Conclusion Intercommunications services (postal, tele- graph, telephone, telex, and computer-mediated systems) have altered the frictions of distance more radically than any other technology. By doing so, intercommunications technologies have created geographically significant diffe- rences among globe distances, effort distances, and metaphorical distances. Such processes of distance alteration began in the early nineteenth century. Conceptual responses to new distance relationships were evident as early as the mid- nineteenth century, although most explicit dis- cussions of new kinds of distances have oc- curred only during the last 25 years. We are currently conducting a study of the economic, social, and geographical effects of the diffusion and development of intercommunica- tions technologies in Sweden and the United States between 1800 and 1975. The primary pur- pose of this research is to include new ideas about distance produced by intercommunica- tions into geographical thinking. Incorporating such ideas would enrich the discipline by making its theory and models more comprehensive and therefore more powerful.
