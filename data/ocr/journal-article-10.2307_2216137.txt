<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophical Perspectives, 1], Mind, Causation, and World, 1997 THE METAPHYSICS OF PRECISION AND SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE Roy A. Sorensen New York University The influence of language on metaphysics is a familiar theme of analytic philosophy. However, metaphysical beliefs also mold one's views of language. My special concern will be ontological motives behind precisifying language- especially those that penetrate scientific practice. I. RECENT INTEREST IN VAGUE OBJECTS Gareth Evans (1978) argues against the possibility of vague objects by show- ing that vague identity statements cannot be true. If there is an object with vague boundaries, then these boundaries define various candidates for an identity state- ment. Call the vague object A and one of the candidates B. Although B closely resembles A, B lacks one property that A has: being definitely identical to A. Therefore, no vague identity can be true. Evans' strategy is to resolve the metaphysical question by connecting it to an issue of language. Contrast this semantic ascent with an accusation of a linguistic fallacy. Bertrand Russell (1923) accused believers in vague objects of verbalism, that is, projecting properties of a representation on to what it represents. An epistemicist about vagueness, like me, might be expected to welcome Evans' argument. Epistemicists believe that vagueness is just a special form of ignorance and so believe in sharp thresholds; the addition of one grain of sand might turn a non-heap into a heap. This leads epistemicism to be (mis)character- ized as a view that there is no vagueness, that reality is replete with precise foot- holds for even our roughest language. However, Evans' argument should look suspicious to an epistemicist. The epistemicist will concede that Evans' argument is effective against those who believe that 'vague' is an extensional term such as 'gaseous' or 'rubbery'. But if 'vague' is an intentional term such as 'uncertain' then the substitution of identi- cals is problematic. Clark Kent is Superman and Lois Lane is certain that Clark Kent is Clark Kent. But is she thereby certain that Clark Kent is Superman? Ever</page><page sequence="2">350 / Roy A. Sorensen since Gottlob Frege's introduction of the puzzles of identity, it has been recog- nized that ignorance causes special problems for the principle that identicals have the same properties. The epistemicist believes in vagueness-he just has a different theory of its nature than most philosophers. A predicate is vague when it has an irreducible multitude of epistemically possible meanings . This semantic surfeit differs sub- tly from actually having multiple meanings (puns) or from having a set of pos- sible meanings that can be narrowed down (ambiguity) or from meaning a multiplicity (generality). The mere fact that we talk of vague smiles and vague clouds does not warrant the conclusion that the objects themselves are vague. For we also talk of ambig- uous objects and of general ones. Forks in a road are ambiguous. Snow is general in Antarctica. Perhaps the belief in "arbitrary objects" resulted from reifying generality, but nowadays philosophers do not attribute ambiguity or generality to objects. By parity of reasoning, we should not accept the existence of vague objects. Objects can be borderline cases of predicates but cannot be vague or precise independent of representations. One might think a precise world could be ob- tained by deleting all the vague objects. However, every object is a borderline case of some predicate. This ensures that the distinction between vague and pre- cise objects would fail to be discriminative; all objects would be vague objects. Words and objects can be vague in the sense of being underspecific. Objects contain information that can be extracted. When disappointed by how little in- formation accrues from the extraction, we sometimes blame the extractor (say an outdated microscope) and sometimes we blame the source (say a degraded blood swatch). And sometimes we blame the relationship between the extractor and the source. Photographic scanners yield disappointing results when used to extract information from a manuscript. Given an ideal extractor, all the knowledge the human race will ever produce could be recorded with a cut meter rod. Its frac- tional length can be translated into a very long sequence of l's and 0's that can code all we know. All finite representations of infinite facts are doomed to underspecifity. My calculator must give a slightly inaccurate answer to 1 divided by 3. Even an infinite calculator would be stumped when called upon to represent a fact of a higher order of infinity. Since there are endlessly many orders of infinity, every representation in every possible world is underspecific with respect to some fact or other. Russell thought that "all vagueness in language and thought is essentially analogous to this vagueness which may exist in a photograph" (1923, 91). But there can be borderline vagueness without substandard specificity. One rule of chess is that one can promote a pawn that reaches the end of the board to any piece. Normally, one promotes to the strongest piece, the queen. But there special circumstances in which it is wiser to choose a weaker piece such as knight (say, to avoid stalemating one's opponent). But can one promote a pawn to a pawn? A</page><page sequence="3">Precision and Scientific Language / 351 representative of the U. S. Chess Federation told me no on the grounds that 'piece' should be understood as a high ranking piece rather than as 'piece' as understood in the rule 'Each side has sixteen pieces'. What a pity! I had hoped the U. S. Chess Federation would admit that the situation is indeterminate because of the vague- ness of 'piece'. For then I would have an example borderline vagueness without any underspecifity. After all, chess notation (whether algebraic or traditional) is a logically perfect language for its limited domain. Each move can be described with complete specificity. A consolation of conceptual analysis is that one can make due with hypo- thetical examples. My example of borderline vagueness without substandard spec- ificity can be obtained by supposing that the rules had developed as I had hoped. One might still hold out for historical realism; the rules of chess developed grad- ually so there might have been a time at which 'pawn promotion' inherited the vagueness of 'piece'. Or perhaps I should follow my wife' s advice and invent the game "schmess" that has just the isolated indeterminacy the U.S. Chess Federa- tion denied me. Although Russell targeted vague objects, his restriction of vagueness to rep- resentations is equally effective against precise objects. 'Precise' is a contrary of 'vague', not its complement. ('Wow' is neither vague nor precise.) Nevertheless, Russell's logical atomism militated in favor of the reification of precision. This became manifest in Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus. II. WITTGENSTEIN'S TWO CAMPAIGNS AGAINST VAGUENESS The young Wittgenstein took a classic hard line against vagueness. He agreed with Frege and Russell that a logically perfect language must be free of linguistic vices. Hence, it has no ambiguity, meaninglessness, redundancy, inconsistency-or vagueness. Frege thought that these imperfections could be surmounted by re- forming ordinary language. Wittgenstein disagreed. He emphasized that ordinary language is alright as it is. Wittgenstein never clearly explains his enmity toward vagueness. Unlike his mentor Russell, he makes no mention of the sorites. Nev- ertheless, Wittgenstein' s early writings plus his retrospective self-criticisms sug- gest three Tractarian reasons to demand absolute precision. Firstly, the picture theory of meaning makes 'vague proposition' a contra- diction in terms. According to Wittgenstein, a statement's meaning consists of the contrast between the states of affairs it permits and the states of affairs it excludes. For to understand a statement is to know under what conditions it is true and what conditions it is false. A proposition that lacks a truth-value is no proposition at all because it does not provide a contrast. This ensures that the entailments of a proposition must also be definite. For if there were unclarity as to what is en- tailed, there would be unclarity as to what is included and excluded. So the "prop- osition" would have once again failed to execute its essential function. Hunger for determinacy emerges more concretely through Wittgenstein's spatial metaphors. The sense of a proposition consists of a boundary around a</page><page sequence="4">352 / Roy A. Sorensen certain area of logical space. Thus meaning is a matter of boxing in a thought. If there were vagueness in logic, the box would be missing a side and so would be a pseudo-enclosure. Recall Frege's famous dismissal: "A vague concept is not a concept." Proclamations from the Tractatus laser in this credo of precision: 3.25 A proposition has one and only one complete analysis. 3.251 What a proposition expresses it expresses in a determinate manner, which can be set out clearly: a proposition is articulate. 3.42 A proposition can determine only one place in logical space: nevertheless the whole of logical space must already be given by it.... 4.112 ....Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries. 4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be put into words can be put clearly. Wittgenstein had an explanation of why there is vagueness at the surface of lan- guage. Ordinary language disguises logical form because it serves a variety of non-philosophical purposes. Nevertheless, insisted young Wittgenstein, there is a definite system of rules lying beneath the hustle and bustle of everyday discourse. The philosopher's job is to cut through linguistic appearances, to carve out this underlying calculus. Secondly, Wittgenstein may have felt that definiteness follows from the way that pictures refer to facts. Elements of a picture name objects in the world. Wit- tgenstein subscribed to a direct reference theory of names; names mean their bearers. Period. Thus Wittgenstein asserts at 2.1511 "That is how a picture is attached to reality: it reaches right out to it." Wittgenstein does not argue that names must be precise. Perhaps 'vague name' struck him as an obvious oxymo- ron. In any case, one can knock together an impossibility proof: A term is vague only if it has a vague negation. But names have no negations. Therefore, all names are precise. The appeal to excluded opposites and paradigm case argument inspires another refutation of vague names. Premise: A term is vague only if it has borderline cases. And a term only has borderline cases if it has clear cases. But since a name refers to at most one thing, the clear case would exclude all border- line cases. Given that all names are precise, and the elements of a picture are names, the picture as a whole must be precise. Lastly, Wittgenstein links definiteness with the existence of simples. A mo- lecular proposition such as 'Fa &amp; Gab' can be analyzed into its atomic compo- nents 'Fa' and 'Gab'. These logical atoms can in turn be analyzed into names and relations. The meaning of a name is its bearer, so our language must be ultimately about discrete fundamental objects. There cannot be an indefinite series of ob- jects contained in other objects (like an endless Russian doll sequence). For then reference could not be consummated. So the meaningfulness of language ensures that gradations will have an underlying pointillistic foundation. Later, in the Philosophical Investigations (PI), Wittgenstein argues that he had over-extended the comparison between languages and formal games. A for-</page><page sequence="5">Precision and Scientific Language / 353 mal game or calculus has a complete system of permanent rules. The young Witt- genstein had recognized that the rules of ordinary language are incomplete and evolving. But his reaction was to think that ordinary language approximates a calculus and so it is up to us to construct ideal languages. The later Wittgenstein repudiates this attempt to model language by muting the noise of everyday life: But here the word "ideal" is liable to mislead, for it sounds as if these languages were better, more perfect, than our everyday language; and as if it took the logician to shew people at last what a proper sentence looked like. All this, however, can only appear in the right light when one has attained greater clarity about the concepts of understanding, meaning, and thinking. For it will then also become clear what can lead us (and did lead me) to think that if anyone utters a sentence and means or understands it he is operating a calculus according to definite rules. (PI #8 1) Wittgenstein proceeds to turn the game analogy on its head by stressing that 'game' is a family resemblance term. Sure, there are games such as chess in which every move is regulated. But there are also games in which the rules are loose and incomplete, games in which the players are expected to improvise and negotiate the conditions constituting the activity. In addition to this informal/formal spec- trum, there is a wide variety of activities that count as games. Many have winners and losers, many are played for amusement, others involve skill and luck. But there is no essence to games, no guiding necessary and sufficient condition for applying the term. Uses of 'game' only have unity by virtue of their stretches of continuity, much like the short fibers constituting a long rope. A philosopher who searches for the essence of games is like a botanist who searches for the real artichoke by pealing away its leaves. Wittgenstein grants that the analogy between language and games is fruitful. His point is that we should compare language with the full gamut of games. Once we steer clear of a "one sided diet of examples", we can look at language without the filter of a false requirement. Instead of forcing an interpretation on the data, one can patiently examine language for what it is. Thus, by default, ordinary usage assumes a new authority. One might say that the concept 'game' is a concept with blurred edges.-"But is a blurred concept a concept at all?"-Is an indistinct photograph a picture of a person at all? Is it even always an advantage to replace an indistinct picture by a sharp one? Isn't the indistinct one often exactly what we need? Frege compares a concept to an area and says that an area with vague boundaries cannot be called an area at all. This presumably means that we cannot do anything with it.-But is it senseless to say "Stand roughly there"? (PI #71) The ideal of exactitude was, in any case, viciously under-specified (PI #88). The reason why 'exact' praises and 'inexact' reproaches is that exact methods outperform inexact ones (at telling time, meshing gears, packing cargo). Exacti- tude is a species of efficiency-at doing this or doing that. Consequently, 'exact'</page><page sequence="6">354 / Roy A. Sorensen has no meaning in the absence of a goal. The logical atomist's de-contextualized directive 'Be exact!' is as meaningless as telling a man in empty space to 'Go west!'. Nevertheless, the positive associations of 'exact' and the grand scale of phil- osophical precisification confers a deep allure on logic. "Logic lay, it seemed, at the bottom of all the sciences." (PI #89) True enough, we clear away misunder- standings by replacing obscure, hazy, misleading expressions by plain, sharp, antiseptic expressions, But now it may come to look as if there were something like a final analysis of our forms of language, and so a single completely resolved form of every expression. That is, as if our usual forms of expression were, essentially, unanalyzed; as if there were something hidden in them that had to be brought to light. When this is done the expression is completely clarified and our problem solved. It can also be put like this: we eliminate misunderstandings by making our ex- pressions more exact; but now it may look as if we were moving towards a particular state, a state of complete exactness; and as if this were the real goal of our investi- gation. (PI #91) Philosophy retains a direction after the renunciation of the teleology of precision. But it is entirely reactive. Wittgenstein's therapeutic efforts proceed piecemeal, as part of an effort to dissolve philosophical problems by studying the concepts that engender them. But this is a field study of concepts in their habitats, not under laboratory conditions or in the heady mist of hypotheticals. The strategy is to expose under-specified questions by seeing how their constituents behave in nor- mal situations: "A philosophical problem has the form: 'I don't know my way about'" (PI #123). The return to ordinary provides details which let us get our bearings and re-orient. Thus Wittgenstein is still battling against vagueness but this time vagueness in the guise of over-abstraction. The Tractatus is guilty of this kind of vagueness. Take the doctrine of sim- ples which militates against borderline cases. It is tempting to reason that since every complex thing is made up of simple things, there must be simple things from which every complex thing is made. One then fixates on the nature of these simples because it seems that to understand the relations between simples is to get to the bottom of everything. A retrospective Wittgenstein cites this as an instance of under-relativization. It makes "no sense at all to speak absolutely of the 'sim- ple parts of a chair'" because what counts as a part of a chair depends on one's classification system. For the purpose of assembling a chair from a kit, legs, arms, and seats will be the simple components. For the purpose of tracing its origins, pieces of cloth and wood will count as the parts. While for the purposes of chem- istry, molecules and perhaps atoms will count. But there is no straight answer to 'What are the chair's parts?'. In his Confessions, Augustine writes "What, then, is time? If no one asks me, I know; if I want to explain it to someone who does ask me, I do not know." Wittgenstein traces the Augustine syndrome to the psycholinguistics of under-</page><page sequence="7">Precision and Scientific Language / 355 relativization. Ordinary temporal discourse is embedded in practices of rate mea- surement, coordination, scheduling, and so forth. This immersion in real-life language keeps the speaker oriented. But when an idle Augustine reflects on the nature of time, he disengages temporal locutions from their meaning-conferring language games and hence empties the question of content. "You think that after all you must be weaving a piece of cloth: because you are sitting at a loom-even if it is empty-and going through the motions of weaving" (PI #414). Wittgen- stein's remedy is to talk the philosopher down from the ledges of idealization to the terra firma of daily discourse: When philosophers use a word-"knowledge", "being", "object", "I", "proposition", "name"-and try to grasp the essence of the thing, one must always ask oneself: is the word ever actually used in this way in the language-game which is its original home?- What we do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use. (PI #1 16) Ordinary usage is riddled with earthy bumps and irregularities that the Tractatus steamrolls into frictionless planes. Thus the retreat to the rough ground of every- day practice can only qualify as sanctuary if one is willing to regard indefi- nite thresholds, continuity, and guidance gaps as non-pathological, normal, even functional. Philosophers have generally pursued this reconciliation with vagueness by studying ordinary language. But it is more telling to test it within the domain of scientific discourse. III. SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE AS A LOGICAL IDEAL Frege said that the true field of study for logic is "scientific workshops" (1979, 33). He thought language should be made precise before inquiry begins. Putting off a full definition of F jeopardizes the cumulativity of science. A new sufficient condition for F could undermine 'All Fs are Gs'. A new necessary condition for F could undermine 'All Gs are Fs'. How could one apply F in light of these uncertainties? This rhetorical question underestimates our powers of approximation and revision. Indeed, the history of nomenclature reform suggests the opposite strat- egy of delaying precisification until the final stage of a field's growth. (Analogy: the construction crew tidies up after the edifice is virtually complete.) In 1895, there was little chance that there would be a disruptive discovery in gross anat- omy. So the Anatomical Society of Germany published a system that reduced its 50,000 word vocabulary to 5,000. Neurologists, bacteriologists and psychiatrists believed that linguistic consolidation was premature in their more active fields. One should draw distinctions where there are differences, hence the precisifier must wait for their detection. Most philosophers think that the precisifier should begin in the middle of scientific development and proceed bit by bit in light of new data and goals.</page><page sequence="8">356 / Roy A. Sorensen Perhaps these bits can be sorted into developmental kinds. Rudolph Carnap (1962, 12) noted that observation gives rise to classificatory expressions (warm) which then give way to comparative ones (warmer) which are in turned replaced by the still more powerful quantitative expressions (n degrees in temperature). Just as anthropologists viewed society as developing from hunter-gatherer disorder to utopian order, positivists viewed science as advancing from inchoate natural lan- guage to clear, checkable, artificial notation. Given Carnap's prophecy, para- doxes that prey on vagueness will become obsolete threats. The ascent to precision may require rough measures suited to rugged terrain, but once we reach this pinnacle, we can kick away the ladder of vagueness. Since the positivists be- lieved that all truths can be expressed in a canonical scientific language, they believed that whatever can be said can be said precisely. Although William James had kind words for vagueness, pragmatism fosters operational concreteness and heavy handed treatment of borderline cases. C. S. Peirce's (1931-5: 5.373) homeostatic model of doubt makes borderline cases self-extinguishing. According to Peirce, belief is needed for action and only ac- tions satisfy our desires. Doubt is an obstacle to action and hence is an irritating hindrance. Borderline cases are doubtful cases that cannot be resolved by con- ceptual'analysis or empirical inquiry. Thus the itch of linguistic indecision gives rise to the scratch of stipulation. (Nelson Goodman (1951, 6) has popularized the notion that gap-filling is a key virtue of definition.) One might infer that since all stipulations are equal with respect to truth, they can only vary with respect to utility. However, Peirce and the pragmatism he sired, run truth and utility to- gether. Thus a useful stipulation is self-vindicating. Peirce held that the opinions of the scientific community converge toward agreement in the long run, hence their language will also become uniform. Nowadays, supervaluationism is the most popular approach to vagueness. This alternative logic originated as a neo-positivist solution to the indeterminate relations between theoretical statements and observational statements. The term 'supervaluationism' was later coined by Bas van Fraassen in his attempt to more closely model ordinary language (generally to reflect the truism that language is a developing human invention and in particular, to model presupposition) and to reflect administrative and scientific practice. Others promoted it as a solution to the sorites paradox (Fine 1975). Supervaluationists characterize borderline areas as functional-as discretionary zones that can be filled in light of new informa- tion and interests. According to the supervaluationist, classical logic only works when words are pictured in a finished state. To accommodate real-life language, we must consider hypothetical precisifications in which the gaps are plugged with every combination of truth-values. When all the precisifications give the same result, we are entitled to treat that result as actual. For example, 'Either chemo-reception is smell or it is not the case that chemo-reception is smell' comes out true under every precisification of 'smell', so the disjunction as a whole comes out true even though neither disjunct is counted as true. Indeed, this tech- nique ensures that all syntactic tautologies come out true and all syntactic con-</page><page sequence="9">Precision and Scientific Language / 357 tradictions come out false-thereby preserving all of the theorems of classical logic. However, I believe the history of science undermines this pretty result. For actual precisifications defy the meticulous patterns of gap filling outlined by the supervaluational logicians. More generally, history of science undermines the claim that supervaluationism has a greater fidelity to actual practice than classical logic. Precisionism is the conviction that scientific language becomes more pre- cise. Envisage a crystal forming out of a murky, supersaturated solution. We can distinguish between a descriptive and a normative version of this belief in accre- tional clarity. However, the description and the ideal are generally held jointly. Precisionism antedates the logical systems it inspires. There are several back- ground beliefs and analogies that power this conviction. The most metaphysical is the contrast between the closed past and the open future. There is a feeling that as time moves on, what was indeterminate becomes determinate. Indeed, Aris- totle used this intuitive asymmetry between the past and future to escape logical fatalism. He thought contingent statements about the future are neither true nor false; they become true or false as time goes on. Belief in growing determinacy is also nurtured by belief in growing consensus. As science progresses, disagree- ments are resolved into agreement and gaps in our knowledge get filled. So sci- ence, at the limit, makes everything determinate. Thirdly, vagueness is directly correlated with phenomena that seem to retreat as science advances (metaphor, ambiguity, imagery) while vagueness is inversely correlated with factors associ- ated with science's expanding dominion (specialization, quantification, formal- ization). We should also bear in mind that 'precise' is an honorific term. Hence those who admire science and believe it to be improving will be inclined to por- tray it as growing ever more precise. This mixture of metaphysics, boosterism and progress exalting history of science make precisionism resistant to refutation. Faith in progressive precisifi- cation has an allure akin to the belief that life forms become more complex. The connection between complexity and precision is at the surface of Herbert Spen- cer's definition of 'evolution' as "an integration of matter, and a dissipation of motion from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity to a definite, coherent het- erogeneity." Although much biology is inspired by the complexity hypothesis, the principle has proven difficult to verify. There was, of course, growing com- plexity at the early stage of life. But once we reach, say, the age of fishes, there is little evidence of accumulating complexity as opposed to mere change. Granted, some organisms have become more complex in some respects for some stretches of their evolutionary history. But in other respects and for other periods, they have simplified. Generally, both processes occur simultaneously. For example, organisms that evolve into parasites become morphologically simpler. Organs that were originally designed to find food and escape predators only qualify as over-engineered dead weight. (Compare the simplified organs of parasites with the atrophying eyes of fish that become cave dwellers and the flightlessness of island birds.) At the same time, the parasite' s outer coat becomes more complex</page><page sequence="10">358 / Roy A. Sorensen to ward off attacks by the host's digestive system and immune system. Many parasites, such as the liver fluke, must have an extraordinarily complex genetic code to cope with a life cycle inside and outside the host. IV. SURVEYING VAGUE VISTAS Scientists frequently present the vagueness of their subject matter as an em- pirical discovery. Some embryologists claimed to have discovered the vagueness of human beings when they observed some zygotes divide and others fuse. Quan- tum mechanics is widely touted as proof that micro-reality is indeterminate. Like- wise, there appear to be discoveries of hidden precision as when, for example, astronomers disproved the apparent continuity of nebulae by the discovery that they are composed of distant stars. The basis for attributing vagueness to reality is often an overarching princi- ple of nature (Lovejoy 1936). Some scientists think vagueness follows from prop- erties being continuous rather than discrete. Others appeal to the principle of plentitude: Whatever is possible is actual. Their reasoning is that this gap filling ensures that there will always be those intermediate cases that slip between qual- itative categories. A third basis, of ancient origin, is the principle that particular things are imperfect approximations of ideal types. The particular's varying de- gree of approximation keeps one from pressing for too much precision. Study of how 'approximately' interacts with prototypes (Rosch 1978) raises the suspicion that ideal types are artifacts of human calculation. Ten-fingered humans use powers of ten in estimating size: ten, a hundred, a thousand, and so on. This makes them accept '98 is approximately 100' more readily than '100 is approximately 98'. Perhaps the Greek belief in the perfection of circles is the reification of a cognitive reference point. Although it is more natural to think of ellipses as approximating circles than vice versa, ellipses and circles are equally legitimate geometrical figures. Indeed, the drive for precision forced Johannes Kepler to embrace this egalitarianism when calculating the orbit of Mars. Nevertheless, many contemporary philosophers have revived the idea that there are external unities. The scientist is likened to a butcher who tries to carve nature at the joints. So the amount of vagueness will depend on the demographics of natural kinds. A universe rich in these pre-classifications will underwrite a rich vocabulary. An impoverished universe will limit the investigator to broadstrokes. If the natural kinds are in vertical alignment, reductionism is feasible and thereby the unity of science. If the natural kinds of the various fields cross-cut, then we must settle for "token physicalism" and a rag bag of irreducible special sciences (Fodor 1974). Correspon'ding to the metaphysical systems favoring vagueness are world views friendly to precision. Mechanism is a metaphysics of precision because it narrows down the possible behavior of things. Libertarianism is a metaphysics of vagueness because it cracks the causal cement binding all events. Dualists com- promise by ceding determinism and freewill different dominions. For example,</page><page sequence="11">Precision and Scientific Language / 359 Rene Descartes maintained that insects were mere machines but he ardently de- fended the freedom of minds. Thus precision prevails over the bodily realm and vagueness dominates the mental realm. Atomism is another mixed case. It pro- motes precision with respect to primary qualities but undermines the determinacy of secondary qualities. Thus Robert Boyle relentlessly pursued precision in phys- ics but had to salvage the determinacy of biology by good naturedly invoking God's fondness for certain groupings of atoms. Religion can encourage or discourage precision. Traditional Christianity only countenances two spiritual outcomes: the extremes of heaven and hell. Hence Christianity is hostile to moral borderlines and therefore, any factual indetermi- nacies that might underwrite moral indecision. In contrast, Indian religions easily accommodate gradations through the doctrine of reincarnation. Religion can en- courage precision at the level of habit rather than ideology. Islam fostered an unprecedented concern for time amongst African converts. Mohammed demands five punctual prayers a day and they must be directed towards Mecca thereby cultivating daily monitoring of direction. Ritual, in general, magnifies concern for exact procedure. There is both hot cognition and cold cognition behind the ideal of precision. Perhaps experimentalists revere precision because of habits and perfectionist attitudes ingrained by the need for repeatable procedures and measurements. Economics and socialization may also have a role. Ernst Mach attributed the dreamy quality of early science to the upper class' disdain for man- ual labor. Experiments entail frustrating, dirty, corporeal contact with the world and hence were spurned by gentlemen theoreticians. Consequently, early scien- tists were not disciplined by the rod of first-hand empirical disappointment. Often the scientist seems to have in mind a clear contrast between a vague world and a precise one. They can imagine a world of precise objects in which all clouds are perfectly round and day passes instantly into night. Some scientists envision something other than freedom from confusing intermediate cases. They convey a metaphysical scheme that attributes precision or vagueness on the basis of unobservable features. Paradoxically, some of them base their preference for vague language on their appetite for exactitude. For if the facts are vague, they want language that hugs those soft contours. An epistemology of vagueness follows on the heels of a metaphysics of vague- ness. When the Enlightenment gave way to the Romantic vision of a misty reality, there was a corresponding shift in which epistemic states counted as informative. David Hume had favored perception over memory and memory over imagination because that was their order of relative precision. Although the Romantics agreed with Hume's precision ranking, they deemed vague mental states as being in greater harmony with reality. So they accorded highest epistemic status to imag- ination. (Memory has priority in cultures with oral traditions and held sway amongst medievals (Carruthers 1990)). In particular, the Romantics promoted dreamy reverie as more insightful than systematic empirical investigation. The Romantics stressed that the difference between being awake and dreaming was only one of degree. The states nearer dreaming whirl past the distorting pigeon-</page><page sequence="12">360 / Roy A. Sorensen holing of reason and thus afford unfettered gaze into the reality that bubbles beneath the ice of reason. Reason could also be circumvented by alcohol and opium. Hence, the Romantics were great believers in the epistemic efficacy of altered states of consciousness. Humphry Davy defended chemistry by showing Coleridge, Wordsworth, and other poets how nitrous oxide elevated conscious- ness. Davy fancied theories of air that portrayed his extract as a stimulant of higher perceptions rather than as a stupefying "laughing gas". With an epistemology of vagueness comes a methodology of vagueness. Nature is to be approached by communion and contemplation, not detachment and dissection. Thus Romanticism popularized field studies. Language itself is biased toward classification and false order. So literal descriptions are an inher- ently intrusive measure of the world. To do justice to the richness of nature, one must make ample use of metaphor (selfish gene, social cage, natural selection) and indirection. The world is to be opened by the incantation of verse rather than the scalpel of direct description. Truth emerges from the overlay of suggestive images. Each image is partial and inadequate but their overall effect is faithful to the original. The breed of vagueness that is extolled by the Romantics differs from the ad hoc protectionism in which one modifies a challenged hypothesis without increasing its content. For there is a difference between bringing a scene into soft focus and leaving it out of focus. The belief that the world is vague or precise affects one's opinion of how precise language should be. The narrators of nature documentaries pepper the reader with two types of corrections. The first type alleges that common opinion or ordinary language is vague in the sense of having a shortage of distinctions. Either there is no ordinary word to cover the kind (as for the lexical gap for plants with ovaries-angiosperms) or the distinctions are too coarse (as with the mis- leadingly broad 'bug'). However, the audience is also chided for over-precision: drawing too many distinctions, drawing them in the wrong places, or attaching too much depth to the distinction. As an example of last, note that the distinction between black squirrels and grey squirrels is associated with the myth that they are separate species. (For a rich catalog of mis-alignments, see Dupre 1993.) Much of the debate about eponyms (Grave's disease, Fallopian tube, ohm) can be traced to disagreements over the number and depth of differences. A chem- ist who believes that there are only about a hundred elements will not begrudge the discoverer the honor of having the new element named after him. Darwin, on the other hand, believed that biological differences were many and mostly super- ficial. He condemned the practice of appending the first describer's name to a species (Darwin 1887, 334-335). The honor encourages quick, priority estab- lishing descriptions over careful, meticulous study-eponyms promote the fox over the hedgehog. However, evolutionary theory suggests that hedgehog schol- arship will more effectively explore the relationships between species. That's where the action is. Species themselves are merely shards of a continuum. The powerful theoretical desideratum of simplicity exerts continuous pres- sure to lump previously disparate things together. So part of scientific progress consists in undrawing distinctions, to smudge and coarsen what had been finely</page><page sequence="13">Precision and Scientific Language / 361 delineated. History is littered with demoted and abrogated distinctions: celestial/ terrestrial physics, natural/violent motion, animal/natural heat. Many pseudo- sciences can be characterized by their dogmatic refusal to vaguify. Phrenologists persisted in distinguishing between neurologically homogenous parts of the brain, astrologists assign depth to irrelevant formations of heavenly bodies, numerolo- gists to empty calculations on arithmetically uninteresting sets of numbers. V. DEALING WITH VAGUE REPRESENTATIONS Distinctions can also be objectionably precise in a linguistic way. The as- sertion that you are 1.53059 meters tall violates H. P. Grice's conversational maxim of quantity-communicate as much and only as much information as is relevant. The pragmatics of precision applies to distinctions because the act of distinguishing suggests that the distinction is relevant. Thus a patient is alarmed when his physician prefaces his diagnosis with a taxonomy of cancers. There is often a perlocutionary force to demarcations. Drawing a distinction commits you to the importance of the difference. Hence when the difference is deemed irrelevant, there is apt to be an ostentatiously indifferent reception. Is a vam- pire bat a parasite and a predator? Many biologists just shrug their shoulders and note that the distinction is a matter of scale and motility. How high is the atmosphere? Where do physical processes end and chemical reactions begin? When does a fetus become a person? Is Mikhail Gorbachev's port-manteua stain a disease? Many scientists borrow a legal term to dismiss these issues; they say these questions are "void for vagueness". More specifically, they think "there is no fact of the matter" and since science is in the business of finding facts, shoulder-shruggers urge their colleagues to redirect their energies to de- terminate issues. Thus the appeal to indeterminacy guides inquiry by ruling out questions about borderline cases as pseudo-questions. The problem is not solved; it is dissolved. Many flippant definitions can also be viewed as invitations to relax. When a linguist says that a language is a dialect with an army, he downplays the signif- icance of the distinction. His advice is to turn the "theoretical" issue into a prac- tical one. Don't try to pigeonhole the unclear case, just clearly understand the similarities and differences that make it unclear. When classification is manda- tory try linguistic legislation. Thus a scientist who becomes persuaded that x is a borderline F will stop trying to discover whetherx is F. He might do research that is relevant to stipulating x as an F or he might turn to a revised question. In either case, his indeterminacy verdict has influenced the course of his research. Borderline statement entail clear statements. This shows that borderline state- ments can have more content than clear statements and that borderline statements can have logical relations with clear statements. The borderline statement that those with blindsight have vision is as easily understood as the assertion that those with glasses see. So the problem with borderline statements is not defi- ciency of content or intelligibility. The problem is that we just cannot imagine how the proposition could be confirmed or disconfirmed.</page><page sequence="14">362 / Roy A. Sorensen Usually, the point of an indeterminacy verdict is that the issue should be abandoned as a "pseudo-problem". Is clay-ridden limestone shaly limestone or limy shale? Geologists dismiss the question as a "don't care". However, there are borderline cases about which care persists. Consider infants born with a pseudoher- maphroditic appearance. Physicians cannot simply declare the baby a borderline case of 'male' and leave it at that. For human societies demand a clear gender identity. Most authorities have responded by adopting a presumption of feminin- ity: when in doubt, call it a girl. Their reasoning is practical: surgeons can more easily give the baby a female appearance than a male appearance. Expect further pressure for precisification where medicine's vocabulary overlaps legal termi- nology (death, insanity, intoxication). For courts have an overriding interest in decisively settling disputes. More interestingly, there is frequently theoretical pressure to stipulate an- swers. An economical formulation of laws and principles is aided by artful allot- ment of borderline cases. In mechanics, deceleration is ruled a degenerate case of acceleration so that Newton's second law, F = ma, can be comprehensive. In- deed, rest is regarded as a limiting case of motion so that Newton's first law can be a corollary of his second law. Judgments of indeterminacy are fallible. Hence some questions have a hid- den determinacy. Indeed, a number of "pseudo-questions" have been redeemed by empirical progress. Is Piltdown man a man? Initial ambivalence was under- mined by the discovery that this "missing link" is a fraudulent species. Is heat the absence of cold or cold the absence of heat? Weary physicists compared this question to scholastic quibbles such as 'Is health the absence of disease or disease the absence of health?'. However, the view that heat is molecular motion even- tually established that cold is indeed the absence of heat. In other cases, the scientific community is divided over an indeterminacy verdict. Some cognitive scientists take sides on 'Can computers think?' while neutrals contend that com- puterphiles can only aspire to the manufacture of a borderline thinker. Thus dis- putants and side-liners discuss the matter with different criteria and attitudes. Those who view the question as determinate appeal to principle and new data. The stipulators appeal to convenience, convention and custom. Those who view an issue as indeterminate may still raise it as an intellectual exercise. Just as lawyers learn law through mock-trials, students learn science by mock-inquiry. Thinking about a borderline case of 'thinker' prompts us to artic- ulate criteria for defining 'computer' and 'thought'. VI. FREAKS AND MISSING LINKS The influence of judgments about natural and representational vagueness is readily illustrated by the history of taxonomy (Slaughter 1982). Taxonomists hate to complicate their classification schemes with ad hoc insertions of new catego- ries, so they strive for the minimum adjustment needed to accommodate new data. Thus nineteenth century biologists were highly motivated to stuff the platy-</page><page sequence="15">Precision and Scientific Language / 363 pus into their taxonomies. In the end, they did recognize that a certain amount of creative re-weighting of features was needed to squeeze the platypus into the family of mammals. This stipulative aspect of classification is obscured by their rhetorical tendency to present matters of invention as reports of pre-existing facts. (Audiences are more compliant about matters that they deem beyond their con- trol.) The inventive aspect is further masked by the fact that the conceptual change has already transpired. Relative to contemporary English, a platypus is definitely a mammal even though it was indeterminate relative to pre-platypus English. History systematically erases indeterminacy by incorporating past precisifi- cations. Hence, we are most apt to notice borderline cases at the frontiers of science. For it is at that stage that decisions have yet to be made. Hence, there is an illusion that things used to be more determinate than they are now in our "Age of Uncertainty". Taxonomists used to be more hostile to indeterminacy verdicts. According to Aristotle, species are discrete natural kinds, so there must be a definite right answer to the question of how many species there are and which of their features are essential. He was well aware that species seem to shade into each other. (His- tory of Animals 588b 5-25) However, Aristotle's metaphysics gave him faith in underlying determinants in the way determinism gives faith in causes which just must rest beneath even the most turbulent appearances. Organisms that did not fit into the scheme were treated as distracting abnormalities-as outliers, monsters, and exceptions that prove the rule. Since science studies what is natural, "freaks of nature" were ignored in favor of normal specimens. This common sense sus- picion of the unnatural explains the Greek reluctance to experiment: they felt contrived set-ups don't reveal the real world beyond the laboratory. The Greek love of order and their consequent passion for idealization were reinforced by Christianity. Eighteenth and nineteenth century biology was dominated by clergy because they viewed living things as testament to God's existence and nature. Each creature was viewed as the artifact of a divine blueprint. The role of the biologist was to reverse engineer God's handiwork. Thus zoologists had a pref- erence for high fidelity specimens over malformed deviants. Evolutionary theory encouraged a more buoyant attitude toward borderline cases. Darwin pictured life as a continuum whose parts only look discrete be- cause of extinctions. Species separation is a matter of degree. Hence, the Dar- winian welcomes the discovery of intermediate cases as "missing links". So rather than discounting Archaeopterix as a circus curiosity, the paleontologists were intrigued by the possibility that it was a transitional species between reptile and bird. Ambivalence was treated as confirmation of the theory. ("If you are not confused, you are not paying attention.") The same elevation of indecision was pre-saged in Charles Lyell's uniformitarian geology, Helvitus' developmental account of "monstrous" births, and James Mill's associationist psychology. On the other hand, the intellectual status of borderline cases has been demoted when- ever discrete models have supplanted continua: when evolutionary theories of the periodic table were abandoned in favor of discrete ones, when phenomenological</page><page sequence="16">364 / Roy A. Sorensen theories of heat were replaced by atomistic ones, when the liquid model of elec- tricity went down the drain. A scientific revolution is as much characterized by the shift in what the scientist deigns to address as it is by his new answers. VII. REASONING FROM VAGUENESS Vagueness has been thought to stymie reason. The premise is that reason depends on classifications and distinctions are only accurate in a discrete, rigid world. According to this metaphysical argument, qualitative categories necessar- ily distort a flexible world of continuous, quantitative differences. For qualitative language leads us to treat differences of degree as differences of kind. Objects falling just on the other side of the dividing line get treated as if they were quite different, and things that are different but which are on the same side of the line get treated as if they were identical. When we say one color is green and the other blue, we falsely imply that there is a sharp break between them. We are suggest- ing that all the shades of blue are identical. Thus reasoned the Romantics and Idealists. Another rubbery theme is that representations are inherently distortive be- cause they can only achieve generality by altering the shape of what they catego- rize. Thus Henri Bergson protested that concepts only provide a stiff, artificial reconstruction of the object. Metaphysics must transcend concepts to create "sup- ple, mobile, and almost fluid representations always ready to mould themselves on the fleeting forms of intuition." (Bergson 1912, 21) Although vagueness has been thought to thwart reasoning, frayed borders are frequently the premises for empirical predictions. The vagueness of 'life' led Aristotle to the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Granted, Aristotle was wrong about spontaneous generation being a contemporary process. Sure, the doctrine did indeed have a harmful effect on research. (The principle that life only comes from life was a more stimulating guide to the search for micro-organisms.) Nev- ertheless, contemporary biology has endorsed the basic reality of spontaneous generation. Inference to intermediate cases complements inferences to extremes. For example, Leibniz's principle of perfection led him to believe that God packed nature with as much variety as possible and hence lots of borderline cases for our categories. Therefore, he predicted and welcomed the existence of entities that are borderline between 'animal' and 'vegetable'. Vagueness' amenability to em- pirical inference is partly explained by its association with continua. An indefi- nite threshold becomes a premise for the postulation of continua and thus we "continue" the series in good inductive fashion filling in intermediates and ex- trapolating to extreme values. Borderline cases often form the thin edge of a wedge that ultimately abro- gates a distinction. For instance, the boundary between natural and violent mo- tion was embarrassed by projectiles. The motion of a thrown ball is initially</page><page sequence="17">Precision and Scientific Language / 365 violent and then becomes natural but which is the last violent stage? Similar stratifications were cited against the distinction between terrestrial and celestial physics and between organic and inorganic processes. Grey zones are tolerable when your theory says the phenomenon is one of degree. But when your theory implies that the differences are qualitative, then borderline cases become worri- some anomalies. For instance, the theory that diseases are natural kinds is em- barrassed by diseases of degree such as narcolepsy and high blood pressure. VIII. GRADUALISM ABOUT SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE Scientific language only differs from ordinary language in degree, not kind. The same can be said of the argots of wine connoisseurs, musicians, and baseball fans. Nevertheless, these quantitative differences are instructive. Science has been responsible for a plurality of English's neologisms over the last 150 years. New terminology within science itself is composed heavily of acronyms and initialisms; 68.5% as opposed to 7.5% of neologisms in the ver- nacular (Van Dyke 1992). Word borrowings are also disproportionate (22% as opposed to 1.1 %). A large portion of the loans are a legacy of Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778). He founded a system of binomial nomenclature in which plants and animals are named by genus and species with Latinized roots and affixes accord- ing to strict rules of formation. The Linnaean system has influenced anatomical nomenclature and medical terminology. The inaccessibility of Latin and Latinized Greek minimizes intru- sion from non-scientists and so slows down language change. What would hap- pen if geology had been called by the Anglo-Saxon 'earthlore'? Theodore Savory (1967,61) answers "there would be an inevitable tendency to expand its meaning, and to use it in reference to things for which it had never been intended". (Re- cently, allegiance to Linnaean rigor has weakened and scientific coinages have become more metaphorical and suggestive (Raad 1989).) As Savory (1967, 105) concedes, geology remains unusually susceptible to influence by ordinary lan- guage users because its vocabulary describes scenery (flood, fault, plain) that is readily observed by interested non-specialists. Mutual accessibility to the phe- nomena will also form the basis of interdisciplinary influence. Just as with nat- ural languages, pidgins may form between fields for interdisciplinary projects (Lowy 1992). If the interdisciplinary area becomes an established field (like bio- chemistry), the pidgin becomes a creole. Gradualism about scientific language entails that the standard processes of lin- guistic evolution are at work. Etymologists distinguish several kinds of semantic change. Generalization occurs when a word's meaning broadens. 'Calculation' used to be confined to counting pebbles. 'Tail' used to mean a hairy caudal ap- pendage'(such as a horse's tail) but now the entailment of hairiness has been dropped. Generalization in science enables metals to fatigue and oils to crack. Specialization is a narrowing of meaning. 'Liquor' used to cover any kind of</page><page sequence="18">366 / Roy A. Sorensen liquid, hence it was widely used in seventeenth century science texts. However, after 'liquor' acquired the requirement of being alcoholic, it lost scientific cur- rency. 'Liquor' illustrates how physics is not always served by greater specificity. Pierre Duhem (1954, 178-179) argued that vagueness was essential for com- munication because the sincere speaker must assert only what he takes to be highly probable. The more specific the hypothesis, the more ways it can turn out false. The wide band prediction of between one centimeter and five centi- meters of rain is more probable than the more specific prediction of between one centimeter and two centimeters. Specificity is inversely related to certainty. As a corollary, specificity is also inversely related with the speed of judgment. Archae- ologists excavating a site use wide categories for density ('medium') when sort- ing pottery fragments because they don't have the time to measure the precise density (Adams and Adams 1987,423). This coarse information is enough to give the quick feedback needed for the pressing question of where to dig next. Duhem's point decisively demonstrates that there will be vaguification in science in the sense of language change in the direction of diminished specificity. However, the precisionist might insist that he meant 'precise' in the sense of freedom from borderline cases. Then precisionism amounts to the prediction (or prescription) that borderline cases recede as science advances. This prediction must be squared with the conservation of vagueness: natural languages have exactly the same borderline cases. No natural language can be more precise than another because they are inter-translatable. For a reductio, suppose 'My mother's sister's brother is my uncle' is borderline in Russian but a tautology in English. Then a Russian could resolve the indeterminacy by trans- lating the Russian sentence into English. This violates the principle that border- line cases are inquiry resistant. Of course, one can avoid borderline cases by limiting the expressive power of language, for example, by removing 'uncle' from the vocabulary along with any possible definiens of 'uncle'. But the pre- cisificationist aims to strengthen scientific language, not weaken it. The other interpretation is that terms will be given new meanings that yield definite answers where the old term was indefinite. However, any change in the borders of a word tends to create new borderline cases. For example, many of the old borderline cases of 'species' were eliminated by characterizing it as a group of inter-breeding organisms. But this made puzzle cases out of ring species. Span- ish shrews cannot breed with Mongolian shrews. But they breed with intermedi- ates and so indirectly exchange genes. Another metaphor. Precisifying a word is like squeezing a balloon. Pressure removes indeterminacy in one area but displaces to another area. Consider David Lewis' ruminations about 'Do we see in the dark?' (1986, 283). The first answer that comes to mind is no; in the dark we cannot discern anything by sight. Yet we do see that it is dark. (What would other sense could we be using? Don't say we infer darkness from our inability to see; dazzling bright lights also prevent us from seeing.) So do we see a little bit in the dark? An analysis of 'see' could</page><page sequence="19">Precision and Scientific Language / 367 precisify against seeing in the dark by requiring that a perception have rich con- tent. But notice that this precisification would introduce new borderline cases that turn on how rich the rich content has to be. To resolve this indeterminacy, we could stipulate a minimum level of richness. But richness of what? Carnap rightly believed that many borderline cases are eliminated when one redefines a term quantitatively. However, quantitative definitions raise new issues about unit terms. One might infer that the net number of borderline cases would tend to de- crease because the linguistic innovation would be designed to precisify the con- cept. However, the effect of this precisifying intention has to be balanced against the loss of past micro-precisifications. Established trenches tend to be tidier than new ones because the users have many minor opportunities to smooth rough edges. Likewise, established terms have benefitted from many small scale refine- ments that must be abandoned. Scientists do not have complete control of the meaning of their technical terms. Surprisingly, scientists recycle vocabulary from other disciplines more frequently than ordinary speakers (25% of new uses as opposed to 15%-with the oldest field, physics at 35% and the newest, computer science at 53% (Van Dyke 1992, 392)). In nineteenth century physics, 'interface' used to mean the touching surface between any two substances. However, computer scientists recruited 'in- terface' to denote the equipment that presents results for inspection. 'Interface' has in turn been adopted by business people to cover any kind of coordinated connection. Business vocabulary spills into the conversation of academic admin- istrators. Therefore, 'interface' will probably recirculate to physics. A fruitful analogy will lead scientists to import a whole semantic field. For example, geneticists now use the linguist's insertion, transcription, and dialect. Other scientific terms (catalyst, osmosis, parameter, syndrome) have developed constituencies amongst laymen. This is partly due to genuine utility and partly a matter of fashion and salesmanship (behold the popularity of the clinical but meaningless -ex suffix-as in cutex, sinex, and kleenex.) Scientists are also sub- ject to fashion and salesmanship and so co-opt literary terms (quark), slang (punk evolution), and contrive catchy words for their subject matter (black holes, charm, dark matter). Blend words (quasar, pulsar, urinalysis) are easier to learn because familiarity with their root words gives you a running start. However, changes in the meaning of the root words are then apt to affect the meaning of the blend word. A few words (nylon, kodak, dacron, orlon) are without etymologies but most have a past that connects them with other words whose changes may affect them. Ironically, this etymological connection is sometimes forgotten so that an ordinary word becomes perceived as strictly scientific (corpuscle, efflorescence, pollen). Nowadays a moocher can only be metaphorically described as a parasite even though 'parasite' originally did indeed mean someone who feeds at his com- panion's expense. Terms also tend to lose currency when they threaten the value neutrality of scientific descriptions. Pejoration occurs when a word becomes a term of disap-</page><page sequence="20">368 / Roy A. Sorensen proval as with 'vulgar' which used to merely mean common people and 'eugen- ics' acquired a harsh tone after Nazi implementation. It is often difficult to distinguish between cases in which the word changes meaning and cases in which we acquire knowledge of some things that are covered by the word. In the 1 930s, 'radiation' was associated with a new medical treatment and so had positive as- sociations. These have been overwhelmed by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 and subsequent fears of death by radiation from nuclear conflict. But has the word itself changed its meaning? A strong form of pejoration is taboo, in which there is strong pressure against even using the word. Old medical text- books look callous because they freely use 'imbecile' and 'moron' and fail to signal good will by employing current euphemisms. (The American Medical As- sociation now uses 'Hansen's disease' instead of 'leprosy'.) The same texts ap- pear priggish in other chapters because they carefully avoid words that have worn off their taboo (pregnant, masturbation, menstruation). The need for emotional expression can be seen in the "pollution" of chess notation by the approving exclamation point, e2 - e4!, and the disapproving in- terrogative e2 - e4?. More pointedly, they have developed expressions of ambiv- alence such as e2 - e4?! which some distinguish from e2 - e4!? and then unbalanced mixtures such as e2 - e4?!! and e2 - e4!?? which are more idiosyncratic. Chess notation shows in miniature that language continues to evolve after the achievement of precision. A move in traditional chess notation, such as P-K4, names particular pieces. It has been supplanted by the briefer and more system- atic algebraic notation even though they are equally precise. Calculative ease rather than precision explains why the Imperial system of measurement is giving way to the metric. The forces for linguistic change are various. The trade-off between precision and expressiveness explains why artificial languages such as Ido and Volapuk get vaguer as they gained currency. The conflict is illus- trated by the abbreviation of specific scientific terminology (sulfa for sulfanil- amide) and the modification of terms to achieve euphony (appendectomy for appendicecectomy). The qualitative similarity between scientific languages and ordinary lan- guages is evidence that there is no special force favoring precision in science. Instead of engaging in global precisification, scientists only attempt local reso- lutions of problematic vagueness. (Judges also tend to limit their precisification to the case at hand.) There is semantic parity between borderline cases and clear cases. For scientists have the same limited ambitions in their reforms of prob- lematic clear cases. IX. INADVERTENT PRECISIFICATION Like chess notation, the nomenclature of organic chemistry was planned as a precise language; it has a fixed stock of basic word units and strict rules for combining them into compounds. However, the scientist's designs for precisifi-</page><page sequence="21">Precision and Scientific Language / 369 cation are generally limited to modifying a few terms in a few respects. Although some scientists may wish that all terms be precisified in all respects, the various scientific communities have no effective intention to engage in mass precisifica- tion. Indeed, much of the precisification is a byproduct-and some of it is an unwelcome side-effect. For instance, the reduction of numbers to sets has the embarrassing consequence of answering bizarre questions such as 'Is 3 a member of 5?'. The supervalutionist pictures precisification as a phenomenon internal to a language. However, much precisification is the residue of interactions between languages. English illustrates how precision may accrue from hybridization. For the precision of English is partly due to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Although the syntax of English was unaffected, the vocabulary of the French conquerors was greedily absorbed. The resulting bumper crop of near synonyms such as the groups rise-mount-ascend and ask-question-interrogate lets an En- glish speaker quickly draw fine distinctions. Communication systems are affected by a variety of unpredictable external pressures: trade, migration, revolution, war, nationalism (Quebec's promotion of French in Canada), social movements (feminism), legal changes (plain English regulations), new media (television). Distinctions wax and wane in response to rise and fall of goods and services. Our lexicon for cars and electric lighting has refined while talk about buggy whips and candles has coarsened. Lexicons atro- phy from the bottom up because the most specific words are the most dispensable to an apathetic population. In the increasingly rare circumstances in which speak- ers need to be specific, they will couple a general term with all-purpose adjec- tives. This ad hoc fall-back description is not as quick and accurate as a single term. But we only have a limited capacity for learning and retaining vocabulary. There is a surprisingly good analogy between how language and memory atro- phies. It is as if a speech community has a collective consciousness. Use is the common factor behind the parallels between memory loss and lexicon devolu- tion. We remember what needs to be known, what we are reminded of, what we resolve to remember, and what stirs strong emotion. The fuzziness of forgetting allows the tidy portions of language to be reclaimed by wilderness. Disuse brings back borderline cases. Technological developments re-figure our concepts by activating latent lin- guistic division of labor. In 1959, Norman Malcolm had the misfortune of phi- losophizing about dreams just as physiologists were operationalizing 'dream' with electro-encephalograms and devices to measure rapid eye movement and galvanic skin responses. This equipment raised the possibility of pinpointing the beginning and end of a dream. Malcolm protested that dreams lack determinate durations. This claim may be plausible for the pre-precisified 'dream' but it is out of date for the concept that arose out of empirical dream research. Other vagaries of our mental lives might be excised in the same fashion. If so, the history of psychology may follow the history of physics. Before the introduction of reliable</page><page sequence="22">370 / Roy A. Sorensen clocks and scales, "natural philosophers" thought that the physical universe did not yield determinate answers to exact questions. Aristotle's teleological world was approachable solely through approximation because things were thought to only manifest their essences imperfectly. The phenomena are inevitably coarse, so it was considered false precision to make heavy weather over minutia. Just capture the gist of natural categories and their relations! Thus Aristotle insisted that "Our treatment will be adequate if it achieves the sort of illumination appro- priate to its subject-matter. For the same precision is not to be sought in all en- quiries, any more than it is in all the tasks of manufacture." (Nichomachean Ethics 1094B11-14) Although Aristotle underestimated the degree to which physics can quantify us into definite results, he was right about the topic sensitivity of definiteness. His theme of flexibility should caution us against inferring that all fields are becom- ing progressively more precise. Science has become more precise in the sense of providing much more detailed information. However, this sense of 'precise' is independent of the sense of 'precise' which is concerned with borderline cases. '1 00% of human beings have tails' is precise in the sense of presenting lots of information but it is still borderline because of uncertainty as to whether our vestigial tails are really tails. IX. THE DISUNITY OF SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE The unity of science is sometimes formulated as the thesis that scientific language can be reduced to the vocabulary of one field, such as physics or psy- chology. Patrick Suppes (1987, 318-319) has challenged this thesis by noting that scientists in different disciplines find each other's journals unintelligible. Fields have been diverging in the sense that more and more specialized knowl- edge is needed to understand them. However, the unity of scientific language is compatible with mutual unintelligibility as long as the incomprehension is due to deficiencies in encyclopedic knowledge or deficient mastery of derived terms. The unity of scientific language only fails if there is a proposition that cannot be translated into the language of the reducing field. Precisionism does not entail the unity of scientific language. For example, precisionism is true if the language of each field is becoming independently pre- ciser. However, precisionism is troubled by several ways in which scientific lan- guage fails to be uniform. The first is the problem of branching precisifications. In ordinary language, 'season' designates one of the four parts of the year. But which parts? Meteorol- ogists have precisified 'season' in terms of temperature: winter is the cold part, summer is the hot part, while spring and autumn are the transitional parts. As- tronomers have precisified 'season' in terms of the four portions of Earth's orbit. Both of these precisifications are well-thought out and entrenched but they do not exactly coincide.</page><page sequence="23">Precision and Scientific Language / 371 Branching precisifications undermine the idea that the precisification con- stitutes a discovery of the true meaning of the term. Branching underscores pre- cisification's status as invention. A precisified word is like a paper clip. The original function of the paper clip was to hold papers together. This was first accomplished by safety pins. But as paper products proliferated and as wire bend- ing technology has become more versatile, new types of paper clips were in- vented. A number of these co-exist because they have found individual niches. However, the proliferation of paper clips has overflowed the banks of function- ality. Plastic clips don't work any better than their immediate predecessors but they are more colorful. This analogy suggests that some precisification is also ornamental. The drive to refine is dependable enough to provide archaeologists with a way dating artifacts. The method is to compare pottery fragments. Pottery design becomes more ornate because novelty has aesthetic value. As the novelty wears off, there is demand for a new round of innovation. The problem of superfluous precisification is related to the problem of pre- mature precisification. A precisification is an invention and is thus subject to the economic principles governing innovation. This includes the principle that in- ventions and discoveries tend to be made sooner than what is optimal for science as a whole (Barzel 1968). Nearly all credit goes to those who race to the idea first. Hence scientists will invest in projects that offer the prospect of novelty. If sci- ence did not have a winner-take-all reward structure, resources could be allocated closer to the collective optimum. But as the system stands, scientists will spend too much time pursuing conceptual breakthroughs and minor (but novel) im- provements. Bottom line: science systematically over-precisifies. Supervaluationism is further vexed by the conservatism of real-life precisi- fication. Just as the safety pin was not displaced by its descendants, most original terms continue to co-exist with their precisifications. 'Number' has been broad- ened to include one, then zero, negative numbers, irrationals, imaginaries, and transfinite numbers. But the parent notion, like many parent species, has contin- ued to exist and interact with its descendants. Supervaluationism is also troubled by the temporal disunity of precisifica- tion. Thus for one experiment, 'aggression' might be defined in terms of actual attacks and in another in terms of threat displays. These ad hoc, provisional pre- cisifications are short-term decisions, not long term settlements. Like shelters, precisifications range in permanence. Some that were intended to only be used for a day or too come become firmly entrenched. Other precisifications that were intended as definitive are quickly abandoned. Supervaluationists recognize that precisifications can themselves be precisi- fied. But they picture it as a linear process in which more and more gaps can be filled with no gaps being created. However, real precisifications are like house renovations. There is a give and take but not in any particular direction. And there are order effects. The borderline generalization 'All parlor floors are ground floors' can be resolved by precisifying either 'parlor floor' or by</page><page sequence="24">372 / RoyA. Sorensen precisifying 'ground floor'. There need not be any scientific advantage of choos- ing one over the other-indeed, the choice of which precisification to follow could itself be indeterminate. Since the precisification does take place without science dictating which way, there must be non-scientific factors behind the pre- cisification of some scientific terms. Historical accident may lead one term of the pair to be sharpened before the other and hence close off alternative paths of precisification. The order effect may lead isolated scientific communities into diverging precisifications. X. THE CONTINGENCY OF VERBALISM " The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handy- work." (Psalm 19) This image of pan-ephinany, of God sending messages via empirical phenomena, blurs the distinction between natural signs and conven- tional signs. Scholastic philosophers took the Bible seriously and the Bible de- scribes a world that manifests God's will. Since God made everything, the world is composed solely of divine artifacts. In the final analysis, nothing is natural-at least in the secular sense of being unintended. Each thing betokens the script of an ultimate authority who takes a personal interest in terrestrial affairs. The world has been fashioned as proving grounds for souls. "Nature" is a medium of com- munication, a way for God to direct us in a way that permits the expression of our free wills. This explains why medieval biologists describe animals with a view to drawing moral guidance from them. The bee teaches us the virtue of industry. The lion teaches us courage. A relic of these bestiaries survives in the form of child- rens' books in which animals act out moral lessons. There is also an adult form in didactic nature documentaries. The insurance company, Mutual of Omaha, had its own weekly series peopled with prudent elephants and frugal squirrels. The medievals conceded that some of the lessons embodied in animals and inanimate objects are difficult to discern. The solution is specialization and train- ing. Parcelus and other medieval proto-scientists pictured themselves as expert interpreters of the book of nature just as American legal scholars view themselves as expert interpreters of the Constitution. This blending of language and reality is echoed by later physicists who claimed to find hidden precision in nature. For they sided with Galileo in believing that the "open book of heaven" was "written in the language of mathematics". Godless thinkers are less apt to view objects as suffused with meaning. The only linguistic beings they know of are human beings. After Copernicus and Darwin and Freud, we resist the tendency to think that human beings have a privileged status. We have steeled ourselves to an indifferent universe. Even 'in- different' seems anthropomorphic because this faintly psychological term sug- gests that the universe could care. The universe is inhumanly non-psychological. Since meaning requires intentions, the absence of any agent behind the scenes ensures that the bulk of our surroundings are meaningless.</page><page sequence="25">Precision and Scientific Language / 373 Of course, our environment can still be meaningful in the sense of being filled with natural signs. Smoke is a natural sign of fire because of a discovered correlation between smoke and fire. 'Smoke' is a conventional sign of smoke because of a communal decision to use the word 'smoke' to mean the lighter than air effluence from fire. Conventional signs form representations which can be true or false or indeterminate. Natural signs do not represent anything. Since only representations can be true or false, only representations can be indeterminate. Thus only conventional signs can be vague. This line of reasoning explains why contemporary philosophers dismiss talk of vague objects as a fallacious confu- sion between natural signs and conventional signs. A linguistically sophisticated defender of Parcelus would find it salutary to first insist that there are vague objects because words are themselves objects. He could then note that there is no limit to what can serve as a word. Resemblance of V to the letter 0 makes the heart in LV VE part of a word. Lights in skyscrapers are left on at night to form giant messages. Atheists ask why God does not dot the night sky with stars to spell out 'God exists'. A spokesman for Parcelus might retort 'How do you know they don't?'. After all, ciphers look random until one decodes them with a key. What makes a physical object a word is indeed the intention that it figure in a representation. However, this role does not convert the physical object into some two-dimensional literary entity-meaning is a rela- tional property, not an intrinsic property. Thus someone who talks about reading the book of nature is free to acknowledge that the world has many robustly phys- ical properties. He need not be an unrealistic bookworm. The source of disagree- ment between the medieval philosopher and the twentieth century linguistic philosopher is as much at level of metaphysics as it is at level of language. References Adams, E.
