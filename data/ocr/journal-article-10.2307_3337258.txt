Kahan Gallery fea- tured a broad array of objects from many cul- tures. Spoons, bellows, cups, heddle pulleys, and musical instruments vied for attention among the eighty-seven works on view, rep- resenting cultures from C6te d'Ivoire to Tanzania to the Seychelles Islands. The many powerful and intriguing pieces in this well- attended gallery exhibition were organized around the theme of metamorphosis. Inter- preted broadly in the gallery wall texts, the word metamorphosis suggested points of transformation and the blurring of bound- aries-evinced in utilitarian objects with human characteristics, connections between animal forms and the spirit world, and the art/artifact dilemma. The objects, made mostly of wood, were loosely organized by type and nicely dis- played in the well-lit gallery space, inviting closer examination of the many small pieces in cases and on pedestals. However, as one who is much more familiar with the formality of museum displays, I found myself distract- ed by inconsistencies such as a spoon in a case full of heddle pulleys, and the fact that certain display areas had lengthy wall texts while others had none. Yet, there were also benefits to this less formal approach, as when gallery director Leslie Lund would open a case or turn a mount to let a visitor examine the back of an object. Clearly this flexibility is not an option in museum exhibitions. Although commercial galleries are producing more scholarly, "museum-quality" exhibitions and PHOTO: SANDRA KUDRECKI catalogues, certain boundaries between the two remain distinguishable. The idea of metamorphosis in this exhibi- tion was most often embodied in utilitarian objects depicted as some portion of the human body. Examples included two prestige cups from the Pende and Lele peoples of Zaire. Beautifully carved and patinated from use, each one featured a head with delicate, feminine features and an elaborate coiffure, ending in the carved lip of the cup. The head rested atop a pair of bent legs in the Pende example, and a carefully carved foot in the Lele piece. Most likely used by important elders on ceremonial occasions, these cups represented two types of metamorphosis: between anthropomorphic and utilitarian object, and between basic, functional "arti- fact" and important marker of status and occasion-"art." A pair of ritual spoons from South Africa presented another example of this transmuta- tion. At once spoons and human figures, this pair combined the essential elements of each, on both physical and ideological levels. The spoon bowl formed the head, and the handle formed the body, with breasts, buttocks, and genitals emphasized in a symbolic portrait of fertility and abundance. Several Dan spoons offered similar associations, portraying ani- mals suggestive of those sacrificed at feasts. Other highlights included two sets of bel- lows, one Bamana and one Hemba, with wooden heads. The Hemba example was par- ticularly beautiful, its delicately carved head atop the still-attached goatskin bags and well- worn pumping sticks. The adjacent wall text discussed the visible merging of human form O z &gt; m o Above: Ritual spoons. Zulu, South Africa. Wood, hair; 66cm (26"). Left: Shield handle in the form of a mask.

In addition, any tools associated with smelting iron can be viewed as objects of metamorphosis because of their crucial role in the transformative process. In light of the fact that working the bellows is frequently a job for apprentice blacksmiths, it occurred to me that one can also view the implements as a symbol of the metamorpho- sis from young inexperienced pupil to skilled professional blacksmith. Other works hinted at the connection between animal and spirit worlds. Notable among these were Kuba divination instru- ments, itombwa. These objects, carved in the shape of animals, form an important commu- nication link between the diviner and the spir- it world, providing answers to important community questions. The itombwa in the exhibition took the form of a crocodile. It had a flat back polished through repeated rubbing and a body incised with diamond-shaped geometric motifs reminiscent of those found on other Kuba objects, including the cut-pile raffia cloth which has become so well known. Two Bamana objects from Mali, a rifle and a door lock, also carried the crocodile motif, and provided further examples of the merging of functionality and artistry, animal form and the spirit realm. Already an item of prestige and power in sub-Saharan Africa, a gun be- comes even more potent when embellished, showcasing the great skill involved in its man- ufacture. The crocodile form further increases this power, heightening its important associa- tions with sorcery and protection from theft. Although not frequently included in art exhi- bitions, the two Bamana guns on display opened interesting avenues of thought on the powerful combinations of form and meaning in African art. One final type of metamorphosis suggest- ed by this exhibition was that of artifact into art object, discussed in relation to utilitarian objects which embody ritual powers and take on ceremonial importance. The introductory wall text in the exhibition (also the first para- graph of the accompanying catalogue) stated that African artifacts "can, because of [their] content, be discussed as art objects since their multivalent meanings transcend their utilitar- ian qualities." I agree. So why not just call them art? Is it really still necessary to prove that an African object can be functional and be art? This is an exciting but basic fact about African art. Whether spoon or stool or mask, these works are vitally connected to life. While the art/artifact discussion makes im- portant points about the Western understand- ing of art, I question whether continuing to recall it helps our ongoing attempts to under- stand Africa on its own terms. The theme of metamorphosis presents interesting possibilities for discussing both the physical features of African art objects and their frequent function as markers of impor- tant life transitions.

While certain objects, including a Yoruba Eyinle vessel in the shape of a female torso, clearly suggested a transformation in the physical merging of the female form with the body of the vessel, this process was much less apparent in other works, such as a Lega janiform figure used in Bwami initiation rituals. The accompanying catalogue, with an essay by Leslie Lund and thoroughly researched notes on specific objects, provides a great deal of information about the pieces, including discussion of sev- eral of the ideas addressed here. Presentation of such information in the exhibition itself would have suggested more concrete links between these objects and the theme. Overall, "Metamorphosis in African Arti- facts" offered an excellent opportunity for quiet contemplation of small-scale works of African art in light of their form and, to some extent, their meaning.
