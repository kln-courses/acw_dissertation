<plain_text><page sequence="1">III.---EVOLUTION AND ETHICS. Mir. HENRY SIDGWICK'S article in the first number of MIND (p. 52} may be taken, if I rightly understand it, as a friendly challenge to those who hold the theory of Evolution, and hold it not as a mere speculation but as a working belief, to explain how far and in what way they find it to bear upon the practical questions of Ethics. I shall here attempt to satisfy this request on some points, in so far as one man speaking for himself can do so. To the best of my knowledge I shall not utter any- thing new or singular; I shall only set forth, as I believe, that which I hold in common with at least one friend, or have learnt directly or indirectly from others whom I account my masters; at the same time it is hardly possible in these matters to put one's thoughts in a form which even those one most agrees with would choose for themselves, and it seems really the least egotistical course to avoid any pretence of being a spokesman. I shall therefore continue, as I have begun, to</page><page sequence="2">Evolution and Ethib'cs. 335 speak as for myself alone. Moreover, I consider that I am not speaking with an enemy in the gate, but as one taking counsel with a friendly fellow-citizen; and my purpose is rather to seek how we may enlarge our common ground of action in the present than to track out the remoter differences whicil might arise in hypothetical conditions. I shall not even dwell upon the strictly polemic value of the historical method of discussion proper to the theory of Evolution as against divers others whom we should deem our common enemies, although I think it a weapon of great power, and would not be supposed to underrate it in this respect. Thus much it seems needf'ul to put forward by way of limitation and warning. Mr. Sidgwick's first poilnt is that the theory of Evolution, taken in its general form, "has little or no- bearing upon ethics": in other words, that the establishment, as a matter of natural history, of the conclusion "that the imoral faculty is derivative and not original " gives little or no help towards determining a final test for the actual worth of moral judg- ments. And so far as he carries his remarks on this head I see no reason to differ from them. It is plain that if our various organs and faculties of mind as well as of body do not come ready-made, but have all grown up, on the whole, in one and the same kind of way, the fact that they have so grown up cannot of itself afford the grounds of anly com- parison or decision as between different outgrowths of the general process. No single thing can be called good or bad, better or worse, simply for having grown like all other things: unless, indeed, - we assume beforehand, as some persons do, that a world in which everything has grown .is in itself, by some transcendent necessity and in some transcendent sense, bad and not worth living in; but with such persons we are not now concerned. When we come down to the particular topic, however, we find ourselves on a rather different ground. There may be a general presumption in favour of a given faculty being derived, but there is no complete proof until it is shown in what manner it was derived. Anid this kind of proof, in so far as we can attaini or approach to it, is capable of leading to specific inferences of real value. Speaking from the most general point of view, Mr. Sidgwick observes that " surely there can be no reason why we should single out for distrust the enunciations of the moral faculty, merely because it is the outcome of a long process of development." It is probably still needful to mark this poinit in the first instances but then there is no need to stop short at such a merely neutral conclusion. We are not co-ntent with saying that the faculty came from somewhere; we must seek to under- 23 *</page><page sequence="3">336 Evolution and Elthics. stand where it came from, anld the niature of the process by which it was developed: and this is the knowledge of which Mr. Darwini has laid the foundations in his work on the Descent of Muan. Now it seems that when we know this, we have at least some of the materials required as the ground of a rational trust or distrust of the faculty in question. If we can tell with reasonable proba.bility what it is, and how it works, we can also tell with a corresponiding probability what its judgments really mean and imply. To that extent, then, we shall be the better able to determine their worth, what- ever our standa.rd of worth may be; and this appears to hold good whether in fixing that standard we are guided in any degree by considerationis drawn from the theory of evolutioni, or enitirely disregard it. Wheni we look at it historically, the existence of a certain muoral sentiment shows that the social forces of which, according to the hypothesis, mnoral sentimelnts are the result, have been actinig in a certain direction. And if by further and different inquiries we find reason to believe that under lnormal conditions and taken on a large scale the tendency of those forces is to promote conduct anid rules of conduct such as we call r ight or good, then we shall also have some reasoln to conclude that in the absence of special circum- stances it is reasonable to trust rather than distrust the "C enunciations of the moral faculty." If we are satisfied that the process of development is on the whole towards anl end which appears to us as right, then there is at least some scientific presumption in favour of existing morality, such as we find it in the judgment of the average right- minded man, and the burdeln of proof is on those who assert that in any particular case it requires correction. On this. view the existence of a moral rule is primi4a'facie evidenice of its validity, subject of course to be outweighed by positive external evidence to the contrary; as, for inistanice, by showing that it had its origin in an assignable mistake or fallacy, or that since it was established the conditions have materially changed. This is, of course, a rough and general conclusion, and will scarcely help us to a decision when we come to the newer and still unsettled questions of Ethics on which the judgments of right-minded men are found to differ. But it does not seem to me worthless on that account. Any- how, considerationis of this kind have in fact not been despised by pure utilitarians. They have been at some pains to analyse the existing principles of morals which are held binding by civilised me]i, and to exhibit them as implanted in the indi- vidual by frequently repeated experiences alnd expectations ef pleasure alid pain. They give a kind of history of the</page><page sequence="4">E volitit'on and Ethics. 337 formation of the moral sense, and a.im at showing that the motives which are active in that process are oln the whole so determined as to encourage conduct which promotes the happi- ness of the community anid to discourage the contrary. It is wortlh notice that thisviewis especiallyprominent in Grote's Frag/inenfs 0ot Ethical Satbjects-a small but golden book, which I take to be of the first importance as a contribuLtion to the scientific study of nmorals. Now the history thus presented is just of the sane kind as that which is given-I do not meain giveln as a finished account, but rather assigned as the next problem of research anid scientific colnstruction-by the theory of Evolutioni. What Mr. Darwin and Mr. Herbert Spencer teach us is to extend to the race as a whole the process and the conceptions which the English school of empirical philosophy has already applied, with great suLccess, as far as it welnt, to the individuial. They shtow us how the life of the race begets, and having begotten them strengthens from generation to generation, the social instincts which the simply psychological moralist assumes as existing in the average man, but canniot explain; and they fuirther show that it is at least a rational questioni whlether the specific working of those instiniets, and the specific tendencies thereby produced in each generation, and passed on by tradition to succeedinig ones, are niot to some extenit reiniforced by direct physical iniheritaice. As to this last poinit, I admit that the determinia- tion of the shares borne in the work by the inheritance of tradition, as it may be called, and the inheritalnce of birth respectively, may be treated as a matter of detail; and I think we are bound to guard against premature affirmations on this head, anid still more against underrating the work already done by psychology. There is a real danger of our becoming too pronie to call in heredity on all occasions as a kind of detns ex machina. But in any case the genieral result stands the same, and may be resum-ed thus: the theory of Evolution fLurnishes us with a far more comlplete account than we had before of the whole genesis of the feelings which go to make up the Ethical Sanction, and leads to an explanation of one important set of the elements concerned, lnamely the sympathetic and social instincts, of which there was formerly no explanation at all. It is to be understood that wheni I spoke above of a right- minded manl I assumed with Aristotle that, apart from, aniy question of definition, this (or any of the like forms of speech one may choose) is a fairly intelligible term, standing for a kind of man whom in practice we know where to seek and know quite well when we have found him. But as to the conception of Good or Right in itself, or the proper defilnition of it, I have so far assumed nothino, save that miiost people have in fact some sulch coniceptioni.</page><page sequence="5">338 Evolution and Ethics. Let us now turn to those parts of Mr. Sidgwick's discussion which have to do with this conceptioni as affected by the theory of Evolution. His dificulty seems to me to come shortly to this: Evolution is a progress of the species, taken as a whole, with tendencies determined in certain ways, and with what may be called a definite purpose,* so that the process appears at any time as if it aimed at realising a certain type, and may conveniently be so described; but how do we know that the type or end aimed at is rationally desirable as being in itself right or good? To this I answer that the demand for an absplute Good is niot one which the theory of Evolution pretends to satisfy. Far from so doing, it rather leads one to see that the thing sought for does not exist. The notion of Good is itself secondary and relative, and presupposes an end already set before us. There is not a paramount end which we seek because it is good; there are things which we call good, and seek accordi-ngly, because they make for the paramount end.t The Good of an individual is the preservation or welfare of the individual, and the Good of a species or kind is the preservation or welfare of the kind as a whole. Strictly speaking, we may apply the conception to any finite aggregate whatever, though it is not usual, nor does it seem at present worth while, to extend it in practice beyond the range of organic life. Still less are we limited as to the extent of the kinds or classes we may take within that range; for all living things upon the earth, for instance, the sun's light and heat are good, and contrariwise the various forces tending to make the earth in course of time unfit for life are bad. And one might even say that the dissipation of energy, so far as we can tell at present, is bad for all living things in the universe. But if any one says that it is bad for the universe-which amoumts to saying it is bad absolutely-there I cannot follow him; either he is exercising the anthropomorphic imagination which is excellent in poetry but naught in science, or he is using the words good and bad in a secondary and metaphorical sense. If then it is further asked, as Mr. Sidgwick in effect seems to ask, how we are to measure the good of one species against the good of another, I answer that they are not commensurable. The good of the cat is (among other things) to catch mice. The good of the mouse is, in like manner, to escape being * I borrow this use of the word (as not implying design or conscious intention) from my friend Professor Clifford: and I am myself inclined to suggest a corresponding revival of the term Final Cause. Cf. Spinoza, Eth. Part 4, Pref.: Per bonum . . intelligam id, quod certo scimus medium esse, ut ad exemplar humance naturee, quod nobis proponimus, magis magisque accedamus: per malurn autem id, quod certo scimus impedire quo minus idem exemplar referamits.</page><page sequence="6">Evolution and Ethics. 339 caught by the cat. There is obviously no method of reconciling these two ends. Man, however, finds it convenient for his own ends that the cat should catch mice, and therefore considers this good in a human sense, and encourages it. But when the scale of the action is changed, and we find a larger kind of cat whose good is to catch animals useful to mnan, and sometimes men also, then we call its doings evil, and put them down with a strong hand. We fondle the cat and shoot the tiger; but the cat and the mouse, the tiger and the bullock, are, for all I can see, "pprima facie on a par in respect of goodness." There is, indeed, a kind of elliptical manner in which one might perhaps call one species better than another, meaning that as a matter of fact it has been, or is likely to be, more successfuLl in compassing its own good. I am disposed to agree with Mr. Sidgwick that such a form of speech is harsh and misleading; for one might find, I suppose, various low parasitic organisms -to be better in this sense than the higher animals whom they infest.* Let us pause a moment on these terms high and low which have thus fallen across our path. Bythe scheme of Evolution in natural history we are fuarnished with a certain ordered scale of life (or perhaps I should say several scales) in which(or in one of which) we assign a place with more or less exactness to any given type and call it 7higher or lower accordingly. To define the elements of this measurement is the office of biology, not of philosophy; and it may be difficult to make it accurate or even applicable when it is sought to compare terms belonging to distinct and widely divergent series, such as an insect and a vertebrate; but it seems in itself independent of the notion of good and the measure of goodness, either in the proper sense or in the doubtful sense just mentioned. There is however an almost constant association of the two kinds of measurement in thought, so that the higher creature is conceived as also better, and this for the following reasons. First, those variations are found on the whole to be good for the individual and the race, that is, to further their welfare, which are in the direction of a higher type. The higher animal is more helpful and better able to meet new conditions; as witness the climatic range of man and the animals trained by him ;t at least this appears to hold good as between forms that are near enough to be fairly comparable. Next, we men are accustomed to think the higher * I speak in ignorance and under correction, but it is enough for my purpose that the thing should be conceivable. t Mr. Sidgwick appears to think otherwise (p. 59): the, question, how- ever, is not very material in my view, and moreoyer is one of pure natural history.</page><page sequence="7">340 Evolution and Ethics. aniimals good, and to desire their welfare at the expenise of the lower ones, inasmuch as they are in mind and body more like ourselves, and are capable of slharing in our sympathies, and to a certain extent eveii in our social affections; and in part also (but I think by no means principally) because they are more usefull to us. But whatever " risino' in the scale of existence " may mean, I do not hold it to be the same thing as becoming better, save as experience may ascertain the two processes to coincide. It seems nieedful to stop again at a defilnition. Since I say. that good is a relative term, alnd refers to the preservationi or welfare of the thing whose good is considered, it may be asked how I define preservation or welfare. Now the onily answer- I can give is that all attempts at defining it seenm as yet prema- ture, and that unitil we have fuller knowledge alnd are more at ease in the appropriate habits of thought, our idea m-ust remain a provisional one. Certainly I am not prepared to suggest at my own risk alny amendment to M{r. Darwin's state- ment of it.* Neither will I be tempted to set it up as ani hereditary intuition, thouglh I am persuaded it would serve the turn full as well as many other axioms and ilntuitions that have made no small stir in philosophy. But, in truth, the pro- visional notion we have is sufficient on the -one haind as a base of more exact inquiry, and on the other hand as a guide to practical conclusions; especially when we bear in mind that the object directly scught at any time must by the lnature of the case be a type niot widely different from that which exists. There may therefore be a knowledge, rational as far as it goes, of the welfare of a-ny group or race, anld of the conditions on which it depends, and anl art corresponding to that knowledge. And I should describe Ethics as consistin(g in a knowledge, or rather a mixed knowledge and art such as we call practical science, that deals in this way with the welfare of mankind. Those habits and conduct are in an ethical sense right which further that end; those are wrong which hinder it. BuLt inas- much as the whole of mankilnd is too large to be profitably considered all at once for any practical purpose, the end of Ethics is practically limited for most purposes to the society where one lives and whereof one is, so to speak, a working unit. Yet the welfare of societies and races with whom one has commlolnly few or no dealings is admitted as part of the end, alnd is actively treated as such on special occasions.t * I may say however that AMr. Sidgwick's verbal criticism (MIND I., p. 58, n.) seems to be just; only the time for verbal criticism is hardly come. t Two passing remarks may be allowed here. 1.-The welfare of many otlher aninial3 enters, to some extent, into our developed conceptiQu</page><page sequence="8">EvolAttion and Ethics. 341 Such theni is the manner in which the doctrine of Evolutioin appears to me to supply material parts, at least, of the pro- legomena to Ethics. But the further question may be asked, Why should the welfare of manikind, and not of this or that man whose action is to be determined, be takeln as the para- mount end ? -To this I reply that every science must set out from a first word or fundamuental assumption, and this is the very root-word of Ethics. M1an wants morality because he is a social animal, and cannot live otherwise than in society; were there not a society paramount to the individual, there could be no ethics. The names themselves bear witness -to it; mor-es and 7)0oo denote exceedingly complex forms of action and feeling which canniot exist apart from socia.l relations. A solitary being might acquire a want or habit; he could never have laws, customs or rules. The scope and objects of Ethic are altogether social, anid it starts from the social assumptioni. Egoistic Hedoniism is in theory conceivable as a method of life, but I refuse to call it a Method of Ethics.* And the problem of the ultimate sanction of Ethics in individual thought, discutssed with such admirable wealth of dialectic in sundry parts of Mr. Sidgwick's book, and resumed in his last chapter, is to me not an ethical problem at all. I do not know whether a complete answer can ever be given to it; but I doubt whether the question can strictly be deemed even rational, anid account it at best a merely curious one. This fashion of treating the matter will at first sight, perhaps, appear new and overbold. But the same assuLmption is made, though less openly, by the "old-fashioned Utilitarianism,"t when it is said (see Mr. Sidgwick's article, MIND, No. I, p. 60) that "we have no rational ground for preferring " the happiness of this or that individual "'to any other happiness." For, when one looks closer into this, it inieludes more thani the simple proposition that A lhas no rational ground for preferring of the End, the domestic ones being indeed a real though subordinate part of our community, and others being associated with ourselves in different degrees by likeness and sympathy: but this would be too long to work out now. 2.-Politics, at least on the practical side, must in any view be an offshoot of Ethics. But I should like to revive the large classical sense of the word, so that the theoretical part of Politics might cover all that is now callQd by the barbarous name of Sociology. * Even habitual law-breakers are not egoists, but are banded against mankind in a crooked bond of their own, and governed by a sort of per- verted morality. The diseased growths of the body politic, as of the body natural, have still the characters of organic life. t For a yet older witness I may cite the first great poet of Christendom- Ond' egli ancora : Or di': sarebbe il peggio Per l'uomo in terra, se non fosse cive ? Si, rispos' io; e q7tu raqion non chiecggio. Dante, Par. VIII. 115.</page><page sequence="9">842 Evolution and Ethics. the happiness of B to the happiness of C. That is not enough; we want something much greater and harder, namely that A should not prefer his own happiness to the happiness of either B or C; and whenwe saythat he has no rational groundfor so doing we renounce the self-regarding point of view, and speak in the name of the commonwealth, and with the judgment of a collective, not an individual, reason. The Rule of Equity and Rule of Benevolence adopted by Mr. Sidgwick as axioms present themselves to me rather as corollaries of the one fundamental axiom, Again, it is sufficiently clear that the moral sentiment and the moral sanction, such as they exist in fact, are in their nature social and work towards a social end; for the exposition of this I must again refer to Grote's post- humous essays. "The safety, happiness and welfare of the society " are found in practice, as Grote says, to be aimed at, skilfully or unskilfully, by the moral rules of all peoples. How this came to pass is doubtless a question of great interest; and here again the, doctrine of Evolution fitly steps in to complete our historical prolegomena. Filling up a blank in knowledge which no purely ethical speculations could fill, it shows us decisively that the social sentimnlent of morality, such as we now find it, is itself the offspring of social life, and could have had no being otherwise. But again, when we have assumed the common weal as the End or Final Cause of Ethics, how are we to determine what conduces to it? There seems to be aii impression that some followers of Mr. Darwin are eager to forsake the slow and toilsome ways of experience, and settle all disputed points by deduction from the theory of Evolution. For my own part I must say plainly, though perhaps it is already contained in what has been said above, that I should regard any such attempt as altogether mistaken. I think, as at present advised, that Mr. Darwin's test of Welfare and Bentham's test of Happiness, different as they are in conception, yet so far coincide for most or all purposes of immediate action that there need be no break between them in practice, and the method of dealing with practical questions remains very much thle same. Thus I have no hesitation in accepting Mr. Sidgwick's account of the "Unconscious Utilitarianism" of common sense (MiQthods of Ethics, Bk. 4, Oh. 3) with little or no change beyond what is suggested by Mr. Sidgwick himself in his note at the end of the chapter; I should say that not Happiness but Welfare is the dimly descried goal of common sense, and the quality of conduct that tells in the long run is not Mr. Sidgwick's " Felicific Quality," but some- thing slightly different which might be called welfaresomneness;</page><page sequence="10">Evolution anzd Ethics. 343 but [ quite agree with him that the discrepancy may for present purposes be neglected. Again, almost all Mr. Sidgwick says in the two following chapters on the relation of theoretical ethics to existing Positive Morality seems to me both true and opportune, and I can welcome it without reserve. I see no reason to suppose that empirical utilitarianism, or something only verbally distinguishable from it, will be superseded as a working method in either Ethics or Politics within any time we can reasonably look forward to. Moreover I hol-d that the question put by Mr. Sidgwick at the end of his paper, namely, what is to be done when reasoned conclusions fall out with un- reasoned (I will not say unreasoning) sentiment, does not admit of any formal answer. However, I will try to set down some of my own general notions on the matter. The first impression of a right-minded man's ethical judgment on a given case is always of some worth, and often of great worth. That worth consists in its being representative; that is, the man's judgment is evidence of the existence and contents of an established rule of morality; for we presume that other right- minded men will judge likewise. The strength of this evidence will of course vary; there are elementary cases where it is all but conclusive, and doubtful cases where it fails, in other words, where in fact no rule exists; yet in the case where it fails, the judgment still has a certain representative worth. For even then it is hardly ever solitary, but stands for one of the social tendencies among which the final choice is to lie; though it cannot give us a rule, it can show us out of what kind of materials a rule is being made. I have already said that on the Evolution-hypothesis there is a presumption in favour of existing moral rules; and I may add that in a civilised and free community like our own that presumption is exceedingly strong. We can have little sympathy, for instance, with a man who professes to be assured by his own conscience that the institu- tion of property is immoral, if he acts upon the bidding of his conscience and suffers the ordinary consequences. In really doubtful cases, on the other hand, I should say that the un- conscious process of intuitive moral judgment would for the most part be a safer guide to an ordinary man than any process of explicit reasoning;* but this depends after all on the man's individual temper and character, and the nature of the particular case. Explicit reasoning is liable to be biassed by desire; but a man of trained reason and controlled will may guard against this; and in some cases, again, desire may be * I note that Mr. Sidgwick recognises (Methods of Ethwis, p. 202) a " tact or trained instinct " in ethics considered as the Art of Life, analogous to the instinctive skilled judgment of the expert in a special art,</page><page sequence="11">i t8Evoluttion and Ftithiq. abselnt or evenly balanced. But tbe wlhole topic is too special and intricate to be now pursued. The main thilng to remember, as I would submit, is that there are only two kinds of difficuilt cases; either one can find no rule that is applicable, or one c.annot accept the rule that exists; an-4 both Kinds are in practice quite exceptionial. I think- one seldom performs a consciois calculatioln with reference to happiness or welfare except on the sort of occasions where it might be said to be morally wrong to clhoose without deliberation, but lnone of the alternative couirses of actioni cani be called wronig in a moral senise after it has been deliberately choseni. There is one last word to sav concerning the suipposed claim of the doctrine of Evolutionl to reconcile the conflict betweeni thle Intuitional and the Utilitarian schools: we are expected, it wotou.l seem, to produce Mr. Darwiln as a dleuts ex machind in the strictly dramatic and classical sense. Now there are several kinds of reconciliation. Opposing parties are, generally speaking, niot reconciled except by some sort of compromiise: and to have a clear understanding of the reconciliation one must know on1 wlhat terms the compromise is mnade. They may be terms of equal giving and taking, or nearly so. BuLt the man who agrees with his adversary quickly while he is in the way miy no less be said to be reconciled with him, and the friend or a,rbiter who advises this course to effect a reconciliation. And it appears to me (as well as to Mr. Sidgwick) to be rather in this fashion, if at all, that the parties to a long and stubborn contest are to be reconciled in this case. For the doctrine of Evolution, while it shows tlhat the criticisms of Intuitional moralists on the standing expo- sitions of the Utilitariani system are to some extent well founded, at the same time destroys thefouLdation of Inituitional systems more utterly than Utilitarian criticism had eveni attempted to do. If Benthamn is right, Ilntuitionlists are wrong; if Mr. Darwin is right, they must be wrong. The Intaitionist denies that moral sentiment can be accounted for by the materials given in the experience of the ilndividual; but he denies it onlv for the sake of establishing a scheme of absolute and im- mutable morality. What comfort shall he take in being told that his first positioni is indeed in a nianner right, that manner being wholly different from what he supposed, when in the same breath he is told that his absolute and immutable morality is iminu- tably and absolutely a chimera? The Utilitarian, again, strives to finid the law of the common weal in tlle growth and motives of the single mind: shall he be discomfited, or shall he not the more rejoice, when a wider insight summonis him to behold the stars in their courses fightiug for himii, and the power he souight even at hand, uinperceived buLt irresistible, the fruLit of man's common</page><page sequence="12">Collecti ve an )zAbstract PTermIs. 345 life anid his heritage from all generations ? There is no recon- ciliation between the right and the wrolng way of search, between the path of patient experielnce and the flight of un- warralnted assuLmption. The theory of Evolution has come to do great things in the field of m-nental philosophy, as well as in that of natural philosophy-a terma English workers have been launghed to scorn for retaining, and that is lnow seen to be more true' than ever: bnt this new learning that has sprung fortl under our eyes, and for the most part, as our children will be proud- to thilnk, under the hands of living Englishmen, has come not to destroy but to fulfil the work of those English leaders of thought wlho were foremnost in proclaimninig that there is but olne reasoni and one rule of trutlh for miiatter and spirit, for man and the world, for the greatest thilngs and the least.
