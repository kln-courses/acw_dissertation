EDGAR PELTENBURG Department of Archaeology University of Edinburgh 19 George Square Edinburgh, U.K. EH8 9JZ This article presumes that small prestate societies possessed fluctuating asymmet- rical political relationships and that those relationships may have left material cor- relates in the archaeological record. Settlement discontinuity in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods of Cyprus may be due in part to recurrent community fissioning caused by resistance to attempts by subgroups to extend power. Following Trigger (1990: 145), a brief attempt is made to isolate and assess those new features that eventually eroded resistance to the establishment of stratified society. n ongoing debates about the appearance of stra- tified society, evolutionary theory continues to be regarded as the most persuasive explanatory framework in archaeology (e.g. Kristiansen 1991: 16). While unilinear evolution has been discredited, we still tend to operate with western models derived from Service (1962), Fried (1967), Friedman and Rowlands (1982), and others who have as their ex- plicit aim a generalizing or global program. A more implicit aim of these overarching paradigms is that the majority offer a progressive scheme from simple to complex, from bands to states. As Rowlands (1989: 36) asserts, "the meta-narrative of simple to complex is a dominant ideology that organizes the writing of contemporary world prehistory in favour of a modernizing ethos and the primacy of the West." These neoevolutionary models have pro- vided a major impetus to archaeological research in which, very often, sets of increasingly hetero- geneous material remains are correlated with as- cending stages of complexity (but see Friedman 1982). One unhappy result has been the frequent im- position of static stadial constructs on the dynamic realities of the sequential archaeological record. Communities tend to be pigeonholed, trapped on a rung of the evolutionary ladder until "change" oc- curs. The effect often is to deny or diminish the significance of variation in the archaeological record until important changes occur. Yet, as Wolf (1984: 399) states, "Cultural construction, reconstruction, deconstruction are ongoing processes." Tendencies to extend conditions of existence to social conflicts of interest, and to change as a result of the resolution of such conflicts are pervasive in most small-scale societies (Braun 1990: 75-76). These social negoti- ations and manipulations take place in prefarming and sedentary agricultural groups (Bender 1978). Since stasis, in this context, is a relative term, we need to evaluate seemingly minor fluctuations in ex- change, demography, burial customs, specialization, and surplus production, both in their own right and as preadaptive stages prior to fundamental systemic transformation. In a recent series of studies devoted to "middle range" societies (Upham 1990), a number of con- tributors stressed how people in egalitarian groups actively resist trends toward political hierarchy and social inequality. Feinman and Neitzel (1984) have shown that asymmetrical political relationships nonetheless exist in all sedentary societies and that they are constantly being realigned. We should therefore expect tension and perhaps long-term in- stability rather than homoeostasis in small, prestate groups. The lengthy Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Bronze Age record of Cyprus (Held 1992; Knapp 1990) indicates that it was a very long while before unequal relationships developed into political rank, and before groups institutionalized unequal access to power and material goods. The time span is unsurprising, but the recent increase in settlement 9</page><page sequence="2">10 EDGAR PELTENBURG BASOR 292 evidence and the "closed system" afforded by rela- tively isolated insular developments mean that Cy- prus presents a useful case study for insights into autonomous trajectories that lead from acephalous tribal societies to chiefdoms and states (cf. Bender 1978: 214). In spite of the encouragement of Trig- ger (1990: 145) to examine "powerful and well- integrated mechanisms to defend equality that must be eliminated if hierarchical organizations are to develop," and Bender's caution (1990: 256) that "the process of resistance also involves change," little attention has been focused on those processes in Cyprus. An evaluation of the controlling mecha- nisms to sustain equality, if successful over a long period, will help to define additional factors that caused more profound transformations of the whole system. In this article I shall consider the correla- tion of one possible controlling mechanism with an archaeologically visible, recurrent feature of the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods in Cyprus, the discontinuity in settlement occupations, and new factors that occurred as systemic structural changes become apparent. DYNAMICS OF LATE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT The Late Neolithic Cypriot landscape was sparsely occupied by small villages with monocel- lular structures. Current estimates for the longevity of those villages are less than half a millennium, and calibrated radiocarbon dates indicate that they were established between 4500 and 4000 B.C.E. (Held 1992). Excavated examples have disclosed several phases of occupation followed by abandon- ment; none has an uninterrupted sequence of phases continuing into the fourth millennium B.C.E. This suggests that a major break occurred at the turn of the millennium. The proposed discontinuity at the juncture of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods is corroborated by the extreme scarcity of survey sites with pottery of both periods. Two of the Late Neolithic villages, Ayios Epik- titos-Vrysi and Sotira-Teppes (henceforth Vrysi and Sotira) possessed such high densities of in situ finds on floors that it was possible to attempt functional analyses of structures and assessments of intrasettle- ment integration. Vrysi lies on the north coast, Sotira near the south. Apart from their contrasting topo- graphical features and pottery ornamentation, their homogeneous material culture points to the exis- tence of similarly-organized communities through- out most of the island (Peltenburg 1978). Spatial analysis of Vrysi has disclosed standard- ized arrangements of fireplaces, benches, work areas, domestic and craft activities, and discarded flora and fauna (Peltenburg 1985). Since off-center hearths dominated the interiors of small, single- room structures, the latter are regarded as uniform, general-purpose habitation units, probably for nu- clear families. It was only when the data were treated quantitatively that disparities became evi- dent between two sectors of buildings, a northern and a southern sector separated by an unbreached ridge whose minimum width was 3 m (fig. 1). The fact that this natural barrier was maintained throughout the history of the site, even when set- tlement expanded, suggests a degree of communal factionalism that is otherwise not evident in a sty- listic analysis of the painted pottery. Quantitative analysis of the contemporary settle- ment sectors considered density of items on build- ing floors and area of covered space (Peltenburg 1985). In each case, the northern sector yielded higher values per building, even though similar, un- segmented, general-purpose habitation units pre- vailed in both sectors. Thus, the average floor area in the north and south was 15.4:10.9 m2, and of ar- tifacts excluding pottery vessels, 32.8: 9.4. Build- ings were more spacious and were associated with more objects in the northern than in the southern sector. To test if discard patterns were affected by post-depositional or other transformations, measure- ments were also taken of artifacts by volume of ex- cavated soil and this produced a similar contrast, 8.2:2.5 m3. The difference was enhanced if craft, as distinct from domestic, items were used, but not to the extent that the northern sector could be inter- preted as a specialized industrial zone. Two of the more obvious archaeological obser- vations should be taken into account in attempting to "explain" the contrasts between the detached housing sectors at Vrysi. First is the chronological antecedence of the northern sector. It had existed for at least one generation before the southern sec- tor was established in and beyond the large ditch that, together with a ca. 4 m high wall, originally defended the promontory village from perceived threats from inland areas. Intergenerational compe- tition favored elders over those who come after (Meillassoux 1967). Elders or, in this case perhaps, the older lineage and founders of the settlement, frequently retained privileged access to ritual prac- tice, which tallies with the unique occurrence of</page><page sequence="3">1993 SETTLEMENT DISCONTINUITY IN CYPRUS 11 u 'SL~~ 00 ? 0 A 'I k I Z . ??i" ~~p ~ ~ I.Y ~ '7-1: sv -~ ?\ i -lU JW2 1?i~~~giWW It~j - 'tot, 1%:;: Fig. 1.

There, in House 1, in a locality distin- guished by the longest sequence of buildings and its central position, were substantial fixtures and remarkable baetyls placed upright in a corner de- marcated by a low wall. They were decoratively entwined by vegetable fibers that survived as sili- cates, and one was roughly phallus shaped. Although a larger exposure of the Vrysi settle- ment is warranted before many inferences can be drawn with confidence, there does seem to be evi- dence for a correlation between an older, "richer" sector and ritual expression. Moreover, the exclu- sive character of the northern sector was maintained by retention of the ridge that divided the commu- nity. While it is not possible to conclude that vil- lagers in the southern sector were denied access to rites conducted in the north, their covillagers in the northern sector probably had more direct links with those rites. Asymmetric social relations in the Late Neolithic are made explicit by this evidence. The north-to-south imbalance in material "wealth" persisted until the village was abandoned, even though there is no evidence that ritual activity noted in House 1 continued in the north until the end. Spatial considerations, moreover, suggest that the imbalance became accentuated over time. While the northern sector remained circumscribed, sand- wiched between the sea and the ridge, the southern expanded inland. Thus an increasingly smaller pro- portion of the population retained control of privi- leges within an enlarged community. There are no signs of destruction to account for the subsequent abandonment of Late Neolithic Vrysi, and successor Chalcolithic settlements in the area are more numer- ous than their Late Neolithic precursors. The genesis of the fragmentation of the community into a num- ber of others may lie in the instability created by the growing imbalances between the Vrysi sectors. Evidence for the evolutionary sequence at con- temporary Sotira has been interpreted in two radi- cally different ways by the excavators Dikaios (1961) and Stanley Price (1979). Dikaios' scheme has four phases in which the number of houses on the plateau increased from 5 to 6 to 31 before an earthquake halted the expansion and squatter occu- pation ensued in Phase 4 (Dikaios 1961: 208). The unstable buildings were permanently abandoned at</page><page sequence="4">12 EDGAR PELTENBURG BASOR 292 the end of Phase 4. In contrast, Stanley Price con- cludes that there were only three phases on the pla- teau of this hill site. Components assigned to phases are quite at odds with Dikaios'. Thus, by the end of Stanley Price's Phase 1, the entire plateau had been built upon. Renewed expansion entailed intensified construction on the plateau and the foundation of structures on the slopes. He postulates a develop- ment during subphases of Phase 1, in which an in- creasing number of houses filled the plateau; hence population expansion occurred more rapidly than in Dikaios' scheme. A common feature of evidence from the two best-known Late Neolithic settlements in Cyprus, therefore, is population increase up until the site was abandoned. It may be argued that Sotira is anomalous since a natural catastrophe curtailed de- velopments there; but evidence from less well known sites such as Troulli (Peltenburg 1979) and Philia-Drakos A (Watkins 1969) also hint at paral- lel developments (Philia) and desertions at differ- ent times (Clark 1992). Community expansion is unlikely to have exceeded 3 ha., that is populations from 300 (Wilkinson 1990: 142) to perhaps as much as 900 (Renfrew 1972: 251), still below lev- els likely to require adjustments to the social sys- tem (cf., Trigger 1978: 156; Johnson 1982). Only at Vrysi is there evidence for internal disparities that may account for the break-up of the settle- ment, but clearly the evidence is too slight to ex- trapolate from this. DYNAMICS OF CHALCOLITHIC SETTLEMENT The impoverished settlement record of the Early Chalcolithic period during the first half of the fourth millennium B.C.E. prevents detailed assess- ment of internal developments then. It appears that erosion has affected the preservation of settlements in widely spread localities and that troglodytic activities, a feature of Late Neolithic communities, were intensified. Buildings may have been timber- framed rather than of stone and mud, and it is tempting to conclude that the adoption of more flexible structural materials was a practical re- sponse to the life-threatening effects of earthquakes on poorly built stone walls. Support for this inter- pretation of the transformation of architectural ma- terials is forthcoming from the last phase of Sotira, where timber modifications of stone buildings are connected to on-site survival policies (Stanley Price 1979). Lemba 1, in the southwest of the island, repre- sents the first settlement with upstanding architec- ture in the Chalcolithic period (Peltenburg et al. 1985). It comprises a few small, undifferentiated buildings. Unfortunately, the record is too fragmen- tary to allow many conclusions. Settlement drifted slightly inland, but the dramatic contrast between Lemba 1 and the next stage is best seen by compar- ison with Kissonerga 3B. Kissonerga is located some 1.5 km north of Lemba. According to the chronological framework adopted here, Period 3A is equivalent to Lemba 1, about the third quarter of the fourth millennium B.C.E. It has slightly larger structures, but only a few are known. In the succeeding Period 3B, buildings of different sizes were constructed, the most im- pressive with diameters over 10 m, and with thick, lime-plaster floors that required even more labor than was expended on roofing beams (Peltenburg 1991: 21-27). The largest, Building 206, must have been 12-15 m in diameter with 113-177 m2 roofed floor space. It was approached by a paved roadway that led from the north between a house with its courtyard and small, rectilinear structures. Building 206 is thus distinguished by its size and paved approach. In other respects-internal lime paving, radial walls, central square hearth, and type of por- table items-it is like the other outsized buildings of the period; so it is a major house, not to be con- fused with specialized ceremonial constructions like the central communal hall of Biedha 2 (cf. Red- man 1978: 147, fig. 5:4). Beside Building 206 was a remarkable, contem- porary extramural area. Here was a unique cluster of large earth ovens, with smashed pots and nested cups, red ochre or plaster stains, post-markers in pits and the burial of an intentionally defaced cache of objects (Peltenburg 1991). Chief among the objects were broken birth figurines and a realistic building model with decorative and structural fea- tures either removed or concealed by a secondary slip. This extramural area, therefore, was the public setting for a ceremony associated with the sym- bolic destruction of a special building and many of its contents. Two components of the ceremony, ritual destruction and feasting, provide significant insights into the settlement and social dynamics of the Chalcolithic Period. Ritual Destruction We have seen that the earlier settlements of Vrysi and Sotira had such bountiful in situ discard</page><page sequence="5">1993 SETTLEMENT DISCONTINUITY IN CYPRUS 13 lip~ Floo ff; r ?:?1 YT -I ~tpj?~,,, 1~ . 48 II' Fig. 2. Diagram showing repeated reconstructions at Ayios Epiktitos-Vrysi. patterns that it was possible to attempt functional analyses. There are no destruction levels at Vrysi to account for those plentiful discards, and at Sotira, the existence of general destructions proba- bly is overstated. Closer scrutiny of the Vrysi evi- dence shows that buildings were reconstructed precisely on the wall stubs of predecessors (fig. 2). When buildings were replaced, the mud upper parts of their stone and mud walls were knocked into house interiors; together with wall stubs they formed a solid platform for the next construction. Before the in-filling began, no attempt was made to clear out perfectly usable, portable artifacts. With the apparent exception of pottery (among im- perishables, at least), artifacts were sealed under the inserted in-fill. In this way, the new entailed the conscious burial of the old; and construction was associated with a closure ceremony. The occa- sion for such ostentatious "waste" may well have been the death of one of the occupants, but support for that possibility is lacking since burials took place beyond the limits of excavation at Vrysi. In two instances where the roof suddenly collapsed, object scatter patterns were different on the affected floors, particularly with respect to pottery. Since extensive object scatters were a feature of the continuously rebuilt Vrysi structures, we may infer that domestic closure ceremonies in which "possessions" were deliberately buried were stan- dard practice, at least at that village. Abundant dis- cards on Sotira house floors may be due to the same closure practices rather than to the repeated natural or accidental destructions invoked by Dikaios (1961) and Stanley Price (1979). Objects continue to litter floors in Chalcolithic structures. However, in the ceremonial area beside Building 206 at Kissonerga, the tradition has been transformed into a public, out-of-doors display. The likelihood that objects buried with such ceremony here come from a single structure is great because of the realism of the building model, because it contained most of the objects, and because of. the</page><page sequence="6">14 EDGAR PELTENBURG BASOR 292 diversity and complementarity of the objects (see Peltenburg 1991; Peltenburg et al. 1991). The man- ner in which the building model was oriented inside the pit so that it faced the same way as extant struc- tures, and the careful dismantling of its structural features, further support the interpretation that all components related to the closure of an actual structure. Although this symbolic closure was asso- ciated with contemporaneous Building 206, that structure differs in several important respects from the model. It presumably depicts another, unexca- vated, structure. The relationship suggests that oc- cupants of Building 206 had some form of control over the other building and that they appropriated what was previously a private domestic closure cer- emony and converted it into an occasion for public display. That such display was for the purpose of communal, or, given the wide distribution of asso- ciated figurine types, perhaps regional integration is made evident by the second component considered here. Feasting Nowhere else in the extensive exposure of Kis- sonerga, or at any other Chalcolithic site, is there such a concentration of earth ovens as in the ceremo- nial area. The decisive stratigraphic sequences for the interpretation of pits as ovens are burnt pit faces, ashy basal fills, and substantial upper deposits of heat-cracked stones with interstitial ash. Those fea- tures are consistent with their use of cooking pits or earth ovens (Hodder and Barfield 1991). Conse- quently, we may infer that the inhabitants of Build- ing 206 distributed considerable amounts of food for public feasting during the ceremony. Those in- habitants, already distinguished by their imposing structure with its roadway, were thus capable of producing the necessary surplus for feast-giving, thereby gaining more prestige for themselves or for their lineage. Such conspicuous largesse has often been linked with the supernatural (cf., Friedman and Rowlands 1982: 207). It is also generally agreed that, as Service (1975) aptly comments: "One of the most powerful of the new politically integrative ingredients [of chiefdoms] is ideological: The hier- archy of the authority system has become super- naturally sanctioned in mythology." If the building model and figurines had divine or magical signifi- cance, then the ceremony might imply sacred legiti- mation of their rank. Unfortunately, this line of argumentation leads to the vexed issue of whether or not the figurines represent divinities or other super- natural powers (although many would agree that birthing/reproduction are mysterious, hence sacred). Another way to approach the problem is to examine briefly the wider context of the figurines to assess the social value of this ceremonial feast. Recent studies of these and kindred figurines indicate that many were didactic models (Goring 1991) and that small replicas were worn as pendants by selected females and children in life and in death. The stereotyped, cruciform-shaped pendants were made of picrolite from the Kouris River, a lim- ited and distant source. Mortuary data suggest that access to these valuable imports via a network of alliances and interregional contacts was restricted to very small groups within society (Peltenburg 1992). Whether that means that women, who were virtually the exclusive wearers of the valued pen- dants, had a prestigious social and economic status (Bolger, in press) or that the exchange system and burial associations were manipulated by male el- ders of certain kin groups (Meillassoux 1967) is immaterial here. What is significant is that these prized birth figurines have an exclusive social value that effectively defined a subgroup(s) on a regional basis. By taking related figurines out of circulation in the Kissonerga ceremonies, the inhabitants of grandiose Building 206 demonstrated their author- ity in exercising control of such an exclusive sys- tem. The association between those actions and feasting suggests that the prestige figurines pos- sessed more than sumptuary value and that they symbolized economic control and privileged status, as well as the more obvious birthing aspect. In another evocative description that can be re- lated to the dissemination of birth figurines and feasting, Friedman and Rowlands (1982) note how, in similar situations, a process of hierarchization may ensue. High status groups (in our case defined by the selective use of the pendants) give women to low status groups for a bride-price, not a wife, which measures the value of the wife-giver. "The lack of reciprocity implies that bride-wealth goods must enter into the circuit, flowing in a direction opposite to that of women. The asymmetry of this form of exchange permits the differential 'social valuation' of local groups in such a way that inter- lineage rank is expressed in bride-wealth" (Fried- man and Rowlands 1982: 208). Transfers in that exchange system include food and that in turn enables the wife-giver to enhance his prestige in distributive feasts. The correlation of Kissonerga Building 206 with an interlocking series of prestige-enhancing events</page><page sequence="7">1993 SETTLEMENT DISCONTINUITY IN CYPRUS 15 involving surplus production and intraregional alli- ance systems is important since those relationships are not visible earlier on the island. Authority and decision-making specialization, therefore, are be- ing established and expanded in an innovative manner by households that are also displaying ad- ditional status enhancement in the construction of relatively enormous buildings. Society is becoming distinctly less egalitarian. According to Friedman and Rowland's evolutionary model, what should follow is the crucial conversion of this relative affinal rank into absolute rank (Friedman and Row- lands 1982: 211). A while after the events outlined above, however (how long is not possible to say, but probably considerably less than a century), Building 206 was abandoned, and perhaps burnt, and that part of Kissonerga was deserted. When occupation reappears at Kissonerga, it is accompanied by new pottery types, and its gener- ally smaller buildings lack the distinctive plaster floors of Kissonerga 3. Birth figurines may not have continued in circulation. The new occupation belongs to Period 4, which is equated with the Late Chalcolithic period of the third millennium B.C.E. (Peltenburg 1991: 27-30). There is a gap in our records between the Middle and Late Chalcolithic periods and during the interval a more technically proficient and highly standardized pottery was de- veloped, suggestive of centralized production and distribution. Varied, painted ornamentation gave way to monochrome, thin-walled vessels. After those changes had come about, another hierarchi- cal settlement plan emerged at Kissonerga. The early phase of Kissonerga 4 is dominated by Building 3, the Pithos House, a severely burnt struc- ture some 10 m in diameter and containing over 40 pithoi. This building has been described recently in BASOR 282/283 (Peltenburg 1991: 28-29). For our purposes, it should be stressed that it has the stan- dard features of contemporary houses, especially the central platform hearth which is lacking in some specialized structures. It also should be stressed that there is more per capita storage capacity than in other houses, far more than required by the likely number of six to seven occupants suggested by Naroll's (1962) still useful formula. While it cannot be regarded as a specialized building, it is clear that many of the pithoi were stored there temporarily. That is made evident by the purpose-designed set- tings for only 12 pithoi. The others, which were stacked in the northern half of the building, had no settings and so are unlikely to have been installed permanently in the structure. The introduction of so many pithoi should be considered in conjunction with associated objects in the Pithos House. Most relevant are small, standard- sized bowls, some found nested inside collapsed jars, and an extraordinary concentration of conical stones. A few bowls were embellished with tab han- dles to manipulate them like ladles. It seems that there is a functional relationship among ladles, jars, and conical stones. One possible interpretation is that inhabitants redistributed consumables by stan- dard measures in return for conical stones that served as tokens. Whatever happened, it is at least clear from the associated objects that the jars were not simply warehoused, but that the Pithos House served as a central storage and redistribution facil- ity. That represents an intensification of labor and production control not seen earlier in Cyprus. The altered economic relations suggested by this evidence does not seem to have continued in the succeeding phase of Period 4. After the destruction of the Pithos House, there is a uniform distribution of pithoi in buildings, and no structure dominates this, the largest exposure of a Late Chalcolithic set- tlement in Cyprus. If this exposure is representative, there was a reversion to a more egalitarian settle- ment organization in the later phases of Period 4, before the Bronze Age Philia culture appears at the site. During Period 4, grave types become more elaborate, and multiple burials are inserted into the newly-created chamber tombs. Previously at Kis- sonerga and Lemba, single inhumation pit graves were the norm. As remains of adults and children occur together in chamber tombs, we may be seeing a greater articulation of family identities, possibly with heritable property. The advent of increased deposition of funerary goods in chamber tombs covaries with the decline in household deposits. Swiny (1989: 18), for example, notes the contrast- ing emptiness of buildings in the succeeding Early and Middle Bronze Ages. Although chamber tombs more regularly possess funerary goods, that incre- ment cannot be correlated with a continuous evolu- tionary process. A similar phenomenon had already appeared half a millennium earlier at Souskiou near Kouklia, where there was a cemetery with unusu- ally rich multiple burial pit graves (Christou 1989). Inter-community variability is exhibited in much of the Chalcolithic period for social, political, ritual, or other reasons. Lemba 3, a small Late Chalcolithic settlement, shows that different paths toward the definition of social inequalities coexisted even in adjacent</page><page sequence="8">16 EDGAR PELTENBURG BASOR 292 . ...... . . .. .. .... it. ji ' ' h:~~., 41 .-4 *~............. ....

It comprises a series of circular buildings, some reserved for special functions, at the head of which lies a much larger structure (Peltenburg et al. 1985). Unlike the Pithos House of Kissonerga, it does not contain extraordinary storage capacity, but it is uniquely located over a cluster of graves that have postinterment access or libation holes extending beneath the house floor (fig. 3). Ancestors are regarded as repositories of knowledge in many societies, since they mediate between human beings and the supernatural. As Bender (1990: 254) states, "Closeness to the an- cestors legitimates social differences; 'feasting' the ancestors maintains social distance." In this case, enhanced status was explicitly promoted by a reli- gious ideology. Lemba 3 was destroyed and the settlement that had persisted intermittently here from the mid-fourth millennium B.C.E. was not reoccupied. ASSESSMENT OF VARIABLES IN THE NEOLITHIC AND CHALCOLITHIC SEQUENCE A characteristic feature of Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic Cypriot society is the recurrence of patterned disparities in intersite and intrasite settle- ment and funerary data. These disparities are most obvious in densities of finds inside houses, labor in- volved in the construction of buildings, and number of grave goods. Differences increase only in a gen- eral manner over time, there is no smooth trajectory for the whole sequence, and transformations may be site- or cluster-specific. Material remains for the maintenance and increase of "wealth" are best un- derstood in the context of fluctuating social strate- gies rather than taphonomic or other considerations. Accentuated intrasite asymmetries, denoted primar- ily by hierarchically organized building plans, are followed by desertion or fragmentation. This chrono- logical correlation is summarized in Table 1. Where there is tolerably good evidence, three stages seem to occur in the history of the set- tlements: relatively homogenous settlement plans (managed inequalities); hierarchically organized set- tlement plans (intensified inequalities); and aban- donment and relocation or hiatus with reoccupation (reassertion of managed inequalities). Wealthier concentrations in the second stage are related to re- ligious symbolism and economic power. Settlements that entered the second stage became inherently</page><page sequence="9">1993 SETTLEMENT DISCONTINUITY IN CYPRUS 17 TABLE 1.

This pattern suggests that communal fissioning was an important check on the excessive accumulation of power. No great cultural shifts are noticeable in these transfor- mations. As Johnson (1982: 408) asserts, "group fission has been a much more common response [than hierarchization] to scalar stress" in egalitarian societies; such stress is not simply due to population pressure. In systems theory, the pattern might be de- scribed as a deviation counteracting system leading to equilibrium or as a negative deviation-amplifying system leading to extinction (e.g., Hole and Heizer 1977: figs. 76, 78). Neither model copes with the rise of alternative strategies for the acquisition and retention of power as suggested by the variation in the archaeological record. Collapse and fission was not an evolutionary dead end; rather, it was the means whereby different strategies evolved. Bender (1990: 251) refers to these fluctuations as cycles, not irreversible transformations; but cycles suggest rep- etitions whereas our record indicates that fission generated alternative means to assert domination. The record is still too weak to do more than hint at a close association between the growth of dispar- ities and settlement fission. Erimi, for example, has had to be excluded from Table 1 because, although a shift occurs when buildings had reached their largest size, the excavation area is too small to assess intrasite differences (Bolger 1988). One way to investigate the problem further is to examine more closely the relations between components of settlement clusters or, as on Melos, the oscillations between nucleation and dispersal (Renfrew and Wagstaff 1982). Another weakness is that most ex- amples come from Kissonerga, an unusually large settlement and hence possibly an atypical one. Drennen sets great store by demographic impetus for change: "The second sequence begins with the emergence of patterns of economic inequality in a small autonomous village. Such patterns of differ- ing wealth would tend to concentrate population in that village as those of greater wealth take advan- tage of the opportunities their wealth provides to make others dependent upon them. Such concentra- tions of dependents would be encouraged by the wealthy since it provides enhanced opportunities for still further acquisition of wealth" (Drennan 1987: 313-14). However, as Johnson (1982) points out, scale-complexity relationships are more com- plicated, and survey evidence in Cyprus shows that smaller sites than Kissonerga also moved fre- quently. The partly excavated site of Vrysi re- mained small and it is unlikely to have been more than 3 ha. Demographic pressure therefore, was not a prime cause of the observed pattern. What may be more important with regard to the case of Kissonerga is that it, together with the smaller nearby sites, constitutes evidence for a set- tlement hierarchy. In terms of size alone, the dis- parity between Kissonerga at some 10 ha and neighboring sites of Lemba (3 ha), Khlorakas (3 ha) and Mylouthkia (ca. 6 ha) is pronounced. Quality of finds and size of structures disclose similar dis- junctures. Settlement hierarchies often are seen as reflections of social inequalities in which tribute is gathered at the center in return for organizing pro- duction, protection, and other benefits. Chapman (1990) has shown how the relationship may have operated effectively in southeast Spain. Analysis of other Cypriot site clusters along the same lines has yet to be undertaken, but site size gradations in the area of Miliou and Erimi suggest that Kissonerga is not unique and that concomitant social inequalities may be widespread. Another possible interpretation of settlement dis- continuity is an adaptive, self-regulatory response to environmental changes in the vicinity of villages. Depletion of soil fertility or the recession of wood- land for building and firewood beyond easy exploi- tation distance are two plausible consequences of extended occupation in one place. Yet, the Lem- ba cluster suggests that environmental maladjust- ment probably was not a prime cause and it raises</page><page sequence="10">18 EDGAR PELTENBURG BASOR 292 suspicions that this adaptive model owes more to politically correct "green" movements than the evi- dence warrants. In the absence of a cattle-and-plow complex, scratch agriculture by hoe or digging-stick on limestone soils, often with terra rosa mantles, will not have caused soil fertility exhaustion. Ero- sion may have been a greater problem, but it is un- likely to have been long term. Moving closer to standing timber resources would make sense if the shift was appreciable, perhaps a few kilometers, but both the Lemba and Kissonerga settlement drift patterns are measured only in hundreds of meters; Erimi (Heywood et al. 1981) and the ribbon-like development along the eastern Vasilikos valley ridge from Kalavasos-Ayious south (Todd 1981) indicate similar intrasite drift, not long-distance settlement shift. Sociopolitical, rather than other causes seem best to account for the discontinuities in the archaeologi- cal record, the lack of tells in prehistoric Cyprus, and the late emergence of stratified society. The pro- cess of fragmentation as a response to what may have been perceived as the excessive concentration of power inhibited the growth of substantial popula- tion centers (cf., Todd 1989: 12-13) which, together with other factors, so often served as an impetus to institutionalized hierarchization. Such community splits were facilitated by low overall population den- sities and the availability of quality resource locales. One result of this system is a gradual in-filling of the landscape with small settlements, a pattern that, as a result of more refined ceramic dating, can be ob- served in western Cyprus. The unstable sociopoliti- cal configuration inferred here might best equate with a segmentary society, that is, an acephalous so- ciety typically in a state of continual segmentation and complementary opposition (Sigrist 1967). Popu- lation centers typically remain small, autonomous egalitarian villages, lacking evidence for institution- alized forms of inequality. There is no obvious sign of chiefdoms, that is, polities that organize "cen- trally a regional population in the thousands... [with] . .. some degree of heritable social ranking and economic stratification" (Earle 1991: 1). Nor are there signs of warfare, a common characteristic of chiefdoms, in the form of defenses (but note Vrysi) or weaponry. One long-term adaptive process comes to the fore in the Late Chalcolithic period. In the Lemba cluster, Croft (1991) has shown how the hunted or managed deer that dominated the faunal spectrum at the start of the Chalcolithic period are but one of a balanced trio with pig and caprines by the end of the sequence. A subsistence shift toward greater emphasis on domesticates coincides with an in- crease in size and quantity of food processing im- plements. Gilman (1976) argues that intensification of subsistence agriculture gave rise to a social differentiation based on the extraction of rent from primary producers by an emergent ruling class. Leaving aside the questions of exploitive or com- mon good management, and societies' reactions to tracts of differing productivity, it is evident from Kissonerga Pithos House 3 that signs of inequality are expressed in terms of control of foodstuffs. Stimulated by gradually transformed economies, limited social segments took advantage of the new types of productivity to maintain their position through control of produce. Intensification pro- moted hierarchization. The anomalous severity of the destruction of the Pithos House, together with loss of life during the conflagration, may be con- nected with such developments. As described above, the subsequent phase of the settlement is without a dominant structure like the Pithos House. BREAKING THE MOLD It has been seen that the Neolithic and Chalco- lithic periods of Cyprus were not periods of so- ciopolitical homoeostasis but rather of fluctuating constructs of power and resistance that shaped the settlement pattern. Some of the observed political strategies include feasting, forging external ties, seizing control of existing principles of legitimacy, and seizing control of internal wealth production and distribution, all regarded as typical of chief- doms (Earle 1991: 5). That suggests that more of a social continuum exists between evolution- ary stages than is often admitted. Recently, for example, Knapp (1990) has proposed that the sec- ondary products revolution (SPR) together with developments in metallurgy during the Philia stage at the beginning of the Bronze Age, indicates the incipient stages of complex society in Cyprus. We lack the necessary statistical treatment of faunal kill patterns to evaluate the existence of an SPR, but metalworking certainly does become well es- tablished and its products were deposited on an increasingly large scale in northern mortuary con- texts. To bolster the argument that a structural transformation in society took place then, Knapp associates many other innovations with the Philia stage, even though there is clear evidence that such "innovations" and other indicators of change were by no means new in Cyprus. Knapp's examples of</page><page sequence="11">1993 SETTLEMENT DISCONTINUITY IN CYPRUS 19 TABLE 2.

Philia innovations, production, and expansion of capital factors are reiterated in Table 2 according to evidence (published up to 1988) for their first appearance. It can be seen that several are far ear- lier than the Philia stage, and none from Kisson- erga belongs to the Philia stage, which is poorly preserved there. Some may well prove to be much earlier, but that is hardly the point. What Table 2 demonstrates is the preexistence of social strate- gies considered as marking a different evolution- ary stage, the long history of self-transforming properties of egalitarian societies and, by implica- tion, the rejection of a continuous and inevitable evolutionary trajectory of the epigenetic type de- scribed by Friedman and Rowlands (1982). It is nonetheless generally agreed that a profound shift towards greater complexity and the establish- ment of hereditary elites may be inferred from the archaeological record of the Early Bronze Age (cf. Manning, p. 93). Ironically, perhaps, Table 2 sug- gests that only those new features postulated by Knapp, the SPR (?) and developing metallurgy, al- tered the balance of interaction sufficiently for the "destruction of the behavioral patterns that main- tained equality in small-scale societies" (Trigger 1990: 145). This transformation happened in a patchy manner on the island, with more evidence for it in the north and around the Bay of Morphou. While there is still insufficient evidence to assess the existence and effects of a SPR, metal weaponry figures prominently in many graves for the first time. The large scale of extractive mining for the necessary copper is demonstrated by the great depth to which miners penetrated ore-bearing sources (Merrillees 1984), and suggests more than part-time exploitation. The emergence of metallurgy is fre- quently regarded as an indicator of profound social change. According to Lull, such production "made necessary other changes in social relations. The original self-supporting communities became com- munities with complementary production requiring trade. This also ... fostered a managerial hierarchy,</page><page sequence="12">20 EDGAR PELTENBURG BASOR 292 most likely for security reasons. . . . The division of labor.. . produced an emerging trade of products with quite different exchange values. The political classes in the self-supporting communities were re- placed by a new stratification" (Lull 1984: 1222-23). Since this mining evidence occurs after the appear- ance of distinctively richer graves with metal weap- ons, antecedent factors also need to be considered. There are a number of novel features in the Late Chalcolithic record of Cyprus, and especially in Kissonerga 4, that may have served as catalysts in fostering enduring structural changes. We have al- ready mentioned evidence for the beginning of the chamber tomb tradition and agricultural intensifica- tion. The latter corresponds to a time of increasing dryness and the retreat of woodlands from nearby Lemba. Palynological evidence for those changes has been gathered by Renault-Miskovsky (1985), who ascribes them to villagers' over-expoitatioon and to general environmental degradation. The lat- ter, in the form of drought, is a recurrent feature in historical Cyprus and it has led to alterations in settlement patterns and emigration, although much less is known about its impact on social systems (Christodoulou 1959: 28-33). While we need cor- roboration from other Cypriot sites to establish the full extent of this phenomenon, settlement disloca- tion ca. 2300 B.C.E. is well known, as is the more general pattern of desiccation in the Levant and Egypt at about the same time (Rosen 1989; Butzer 1958). While not advocating climatic fluctuation as a prime mover in cultural evolutionary theory, it is an understudied factor that still needs to be ad- dressed in conjunction with other changes in Cy- prus ca. 2300 B.C.E. Of more importance as a possible benchmark for radical transformation is long-distance exchange. Faience necklaces and, possibly, imported metal are exotic items at Kissonerga that, in the case of the faiences, were mainly placed in larger graves. Extra- island integration is also suggested by the adoption of foreign customs such as the use of seals, copper hair rings, and urn burials (Peltenburg 1991: 29- 30). These are critical indices of the breakdown of the islanders' isolation and the beginning of more sustained contacts with stratified, mainland socie- ties. Previously, in the Middle Chalcolithic period, there were signs that intragroup exchange in picro- lites was being manipulated (above, p. 14), but it did not lead to enduring control of goods, services, and opinions. Such control may have happened in certain areas in the the Early Bronze Age, yet as Hastorf (1990: 154) comments, "Prestige exchange is not linked to the onset of political rank, but to the extension of power in an already differentiated soci- ety." Differences did exist in the early stages of the Late Chalcolithic; and in the impressive quantities stored in the Kissonerga Pithos House, we may be- gin to see the control of surplus production neces- sary to meet the costs of prestige exchange. Unfashionable as it is, foreign intervention in the later third millennium B.C.E. in Cyprus still can- not be entirely ruled out as another component in the emergence of social complexity. Much depends on the weight attached to the varied changes that accompany the Philia/Early Bronze Age: for some, they represent indigenous adaptations (e.g., Mel- link 1991); for others, limited migration (e.g., Swiny 1986). If the latter argument is eventually sustained, the task of explaining how the entire island moved to a politically stratified society still remains. The prime cause in that case is likely to have been the successful introduction of such a sys- tem by newcomers; but that would have been a prolonged process, and resistance to the loss of individual autonomy continued especially in south- ern parts of the island. Indeed, the firm estab- lishment of greater political control over more extensive areas may not have come about until the insecure conditions of the Middle Cypriot period, when forts were established in the north and central parts of the island (Fortin 1981). There was, then, no sudden breaking of the mold, no clear-cut diachronic evolution: for a long time after the Chalcolithic, coexisting communities on the island probably were at quite different stages of development. Recent work has disclosed that major, multifactor changes occurred in the partly overlapping Late Chalcolithic and Philia periods. Although it still is not clear at what pace emulation of foreigners-whether living abroad, or as visi- tors, or as newcomers resident in Cyprus-ensued, it does seem likely that trade and contact with stratified societies-a form of encapsulation-were critical factors in eroding islanders' resistance to the emergence of stratified society.
