<plain_text><page sequence="1">OCTOBER HORSE C. BENNETT PASCAL A. THE RITE "October Horse" is the name of the horse which is annually sacrificed to Mars on the Campus Martius in the month of October. It is the right- hand horse of the winning pair in a chariot race. There used to be an intense struggle for its head between the inhabitants of the Subura and those of the Sacra Via: the latter hoping to affix it to the wall of the Regia, the former to the Mamilian Tower. And the tail of the same animal is conveyed to the Regia, with speed enough for the blood to drip from it to the hearth, for partaking in a divine service.' THEday of the sacrifice is the Ides, or the fifteenth day of October.2 The festival itself has no known name, such as Equirria or Agonalia or any of the other neuter-plural titles which appear on the calendars; we know only the name of the sacrificial victim. The horse selected for the sacrifice is felled with a spear.3 We are not told who casts the weapon, nor whether he deals a killing blow. In any case, subsequent decapitation would finish the work of an imperfect cast. The head of the animal, presumably after the sacrifice, was garlanded with loaves, "because the sacrifice was performed on account of a successful crop of grain" (quia id sacrificium fiebat ob frugum eventum).4 The high points of the ritual are reasonably certain: the race, the spearing and decapitation, the battle for the head, its decoration with bread, and the speedy transfer of the dripping tail to the Regia. The ancient accounts, so far as they go, can be trusted for their record of the 1 Festus 19go L: October equus appellatur, qui in campo Martio mense Octobri immolatur quotannis Marti, bigarum victricum dexterior.

Bennett Pascal bare facts: when they differ, they amplify rather than contradict each other, even when they diverge in their explanations for the choice of a horse instead of the more customary victims. Those ancient commen- tators who mention Timaeus's idea that the affair is an act of vicarious revenge for the ruse of the Trojan Horse have the good sense to scoff at it.5 (One recent scholar, however, has implied a common mythological or ritual origin for the real and the wooden horse.)6 In addition to the straightforward accounts of the events of the Ides of October, there is also the indirect evidence of the Horse's importance for the Parilia on April 21 : namely, that the blood of the October Horse was mixed with the ashes of the unborn calf killed at the Fordicidia six days before the Parilia, and that the mixture was thrown into the fires of bean straw, as a kind of lustral fumigant. There is no explicit state- ment that it was actually the October Horse's blood that was so used; for Ovid tells us that the Vestal Virgins provided the blood of a horse,7 and Propertius briefly mentions lustration by means of a maimed horse.8 Yet it would be taxing probability to insist that another victim of the sort not ordinarily sacrificed by the Romans was killed to flavor the smoke of the springtime fires. It is commonly assumed, but without real evidence, that the officiat- ing priest, and actual thrower of the spear, was the flamen Martialis. This has been inferred not only from the locale and presumed recipient of the sacrifice but also from Cassius Dio's account of a grisly event in 46 B.C., wherein Georg Wissowa thought that he detected an imitation of the October Horse.9 On this occasion, Julius Caesar arbitarily selected two members of a group of mutinous - or merely unruly - soldiers to be "sacrificed" by the pontifices and the ltEpEV- of Mars (Dio else- where in his history thus translates flamen), whereupon they were 5 Festus 19o L, Polybius Iz.4b. 6 Walter Burkert, Homo Necans (Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vor- arbeiten 32, Berlin and New York, 1972) 178-181, cites similar but unrelated mythological incidents, such as Laocoon's attempt to spear the Trojan Horse, and the obscure tradition that Odysseus was posthumously turned into a horse (Sext. Emp. Adv. Math. 1.264, 267; Phot. Bibl. 50oa [Migne, PG 103.62]; Serv. Aen. 2.44), and ruses employing animals other than horses: e.g., Odysseus's escape from the cave of Polyphemus. 7 Fasti 4.732 f: Vesta dabit; . . . sanguis equi suffimen erit. 8 4. 1-19 f: annuaque ...

Dio calls this manner of summary execution some kind of lepovpyla. The word need not be taken too seriously; rather, Dio has to be given credit for a ponderous attempt at sarcastic wit. He compounds his attempt with the dismayed confession that he is at a loss to explain the "sacrifice": he has no Sibylline pronouncement to guide him. The point of the anecdote is not that it is an authentic religious oddity, but, rather, that it is an atrocity - quite different from the shamed secrecy with which attested human sacrifices were performed, and even different from legal executions, where the overt spilling of blood was pretended not to have taken place.10 If the incident is true, the involvement of priests of the Republic in an open, hardly legal beheading of Roman citizens is not an imitation of a regular sacrifice but a scandal." Aside from the coincidence that it happened somewhere on the Campus Martius - and conveniently outside the pomerium - with the cul- minating display of the heads on the wall of the Regia, there is no con- vincing similarity between this rough imposition of military discipline and the complicated rites of October. Moreover, there is no evidence that the flamen of Mars, who had been compelled to do Caesar's dirty work, also officiated at the sacrifice of the Horse. Nor, if the Horse was sacrificed to Mars, was it necessary to have the participation of the flamen Martialis. Flamines of one god regularly officiated outside his cult. The flamen Quirinalis, for example, per- formed the sacrifice at the Robigalia, and the flamen Portunalis tended the arms of Quirinus.12 B. INTERPRETATIONS The horse as victim, the manner of sacrifice, and the disposition of the victim's parts are unexampled elsewhere in Roman religion. The unusual ritual has been explained in three notable but widely differing ways: (I) the sacrifice is a military rite, with the horse, being a warlike animal, the appropriate victim; (2) the rite is the Roman equivalent of 10 Examples of executions: a fall from the Tarpeian rock, strangulation (announced by the euphemistic vixerunt), bludgeoning to death of a corrupter of Vestal Virgins (presumably with an avoidance of open wounds). For human sacrifice, cf. Pierre Fabre, "Minime Romano Sacro," REA 42 (1940) 419-424; Minucius Felix 30.4; Porphyrius, De Abstinentia 2.56. Non-Roman examples of the avoidance of overt bloodletting: William Robertson Smith, Lectures on the Religion of the Semites3 (London, 1927) 417-429. 11 A similar interpretation is offered by Stefan Weinstock, Divus Julius (Oxford, 1971), 79. 12 Ovid, Fasti 4.9Io; Festus 238 L, s.v.

Military Lustration Festus, even at the very place where he says that the sacrifice was per- formed ob frugum eventum and describes the crowning with loaves, confusedly tries to explain the use of a horse instead of the usual bullock for an agricultural sacrifice, with the statement that "a horse is suitable for war" (bello ... est aptus). He thus echoes Polybius, who, even while he derides the Trojan-Horse theory of Timaeus, specifies that the victim is a war horse: nros ... .roAELrs.?3 This predisposition to a military interpretation, at least as old as the third century B.C., is shared by no less an authority than Georg Wissowa, whose systematic argument has won frequent approbation.14 One of its chief attractions is an appearance of seasonal symmetry. According to his scheme, the October Horse was run at the end of the season of military campaigns, as an expiatory sacrifice to cleanse the army of the taint of human blood and foreign contact. It fell on the third Ides before the end of the year and was followed at an interval of four days by the Armilustrium. Its position on the calendar corresponded to the Equirria, a horse race also on the Campus Martius,15 whose purpose was to mark the beginning of the campaign season. The Equirria was run at the third Ides from the beginning of the year and followed at a four-day in- terval by another lustration of arms at the Quinquatrus. (Actually, the only date given for the Equirria on the extant calendars is March 14, but Wissowa proposes that it was advanced to the otherwise unconscionable even-numbered day to avoid conflict with the Ides.) The lustrations of the arms both at the Quinquatrus and, apparently, the Armilustrium, were performed by the Salii.16 13 See Jacoby, FHG 566, vol. 3B, p. 612, with Commentary, vol. 3b, p. 328, for the suggestion that toAEfLTquS is a deliberate substitution for diywvtoriaj.

The</page><page sequence="5">October Horse 265 There is undeniably a neatness to the scheme of two ceremonial horse races, both in honor of Mars, both on the Campus Martius, both equi- distant from the two ends of the year, and both followed after an equal lapse of time by a lustration of arms and possibly of sacred trumpets.17 Yet, the problems raised by the considerations of symmetry are more numerous than the solutions that they provide. In the first place, sym- metry of arrangement is, so far as is known, an unexampled reason for the place of any holiday on the calendar;18 and the symmetry itself proves to be illusory when it is realized that both races must have originated prior to 153 B.c. - that is, when the year began not in January but in March. There are other doublets on the religious calendar more explicit than the one supposed to have been formed by the Equirria and the October Horse. There is, for example, another Tubilustrium in May. There is also another Equirria on February 27, also dedicated to Mars;19 and a more convincing case can be made for a correspondence between the two holidays called Equirria than for any between the Equirria and the October Horse. Although Ovid calls the March Equirria the "second" one,20 it is really the first, if one reckons according to an archaic calendar whose New Year was in March. The February Equirria, then, coming on the last odd-numbered day of the month, is the year's last celebration in honor of Mars and, indeed, the end of the religious year. The Equirria in March, whether it was originally on the Ides or simply at some con- venient day between the Nones and the Ides (holidays before the Nones are rare), is part of the celebrations which usher in the New Year. Thus, while there could very well have been a roughly symmetrical cycle of holidays marked by equestrian exercises, the October Horse was not one of them. There is, moreover, a better-than-negligible argumentum ex silentio against the military interpretation. It would be expected that at least etymology is less reliable than the account of what was done, as in loannes Lydus, De Mensibus 4.55. Cf. Paulus 17 L: Armilustrium . . . quo res divinas armati faciebant, ac, dum sacrificarent, tubis canebant, where the armati (again, an apparently forced etymology for Armilustrium) seem to be the Saliar priests. Paulus seems mistakenly to be describing a tubilustrium (Wissowa RE 2.x 189), possibly one conducted by the Salii four days after the Armilustrium, like the Tubilustrium which comes after the Quinquatrus: De Mensibus 4.60. 17 Cf. the preceding note. 18 Th. Mommsen, CIL 12, p. 332, also doubts that the Equirria was moved to the even-numbered day before the Ides. 19 Ovid, Fasti 2.858: Marsque citos iunctis curribus urget equos. 20 Ovid, Fasti 3.519: altera gramineo spectabis Equirria Campo.</page><page sequence="6">266 C. Bennett Pascal one of the fairly circumstantial descriptions of the October Horse would have mentioned any special procedures of military lustration or con- tained some clear statement of the military purposes of the sacrifice, but both Polybius and Plutarch seem to be a little confused on this point. The only specific reason for the sacrifice given in antiquity is ob frugum eventum. If, then, the attribution to Mars is more than an inference from the place of sacrifice or the steed's traditional role, then the god promoting the success of fruges would have to be the old Italic agri- cultural god, not the Hellenized replica of Ares. However, the famed Indo-Europeanist, Georges Dumezil, endeavor- ing to prove the kinship of the October Horse to a Vedic sacrifice, rallies a formidable battery of objections to an agricultural interpretation of the Roman sacrifice and, for that matter, to the very idea of an agricultural Mars.21 The chief ones are the following: (i) Festus's ob frugum eventum, as Dumezil sees it, does not prove that either the sacrifice or Mars was meant to ensure fertility. Mars' contribution to the safety of the crop was to repel the enemy from the fields.22 Ob frugum eventum looks backward, to a benefit received, not forward; otherwise Festus could have written frugum eventus causa or ut fruges eveniant.23 The sacrifice, in other words, was not a prayer for the grain about to be brought in, but thanksgiving to the god of war for having provided the protection which made the past year's bounty pos- sible. In any event, had the object been to promote fertility, the cele- brants would have adorned the Horse's head with seed or corn, not loaves. (2) The sacrificing functionary used a spear, an implement of war, not the usual mallet and securis, or sacrificial axe. (3) There is no direct evidence that the blood or other remains of the October Horse were used at the Parilia. Propertius's curtus equus need not have been a tailless horse but one ritually maimed in any one of countless other possible ways. The severed tail would not have yielded enough blood to be of any use the following spring. Therefore, it would appear that another horse was killed for the Parilia. Dum6zil's objections are not insurmountable. 21 Georges Dumdzil, "Bellator Equos," in Rituels indo-europdens a Rome (Etudes et commentaires 16, Paris, 1954) 73-91; id., Rdligion romaine, 221 i ff; id., Fetes romaines d'edt et d'automne (Editions Gallimard, 1975), passim. 22 The same conclusion was independently reached by L.

Yet, Roman holidays looked forward, pragmatically, to produce a desired result, rather than back, in a Judeo-Christian spirit of gratitude. The principle of regularly scheduled celebrations was do ut des. After-the-fact thanks, when they were paid, were not regular items on the festival calendar but votive payments of particular contracts made between a man and a god (votum solvit libens merito). Thanks- giving celebrations had no fixed, recurring place on the calendar. It is true that ob frugum eventum, so phrased, could mean that the celebrants were thinking of past benefits, but the preposition ob can also look forward to an anticipated result.24 In any event, and more to the point, October was not the time of the Roman wheat harvest; it was the time when the next year's winter wheat was being planted.25 Thus, the sacrifice looked forward to a harvest yet to grow and to be brought in. The decoration of the Horse's head was obviously a kind of sympa- thetic magic. It is conceivable, as Dumizil urges, that some sort of unprocessed grain would be appropriate. But bread was, after all, the ultimate goal of agricultural abundance, and far from inconceivable as a fitting source of magic. (2) Granted that the spear is an implement of war and an uncommon sacrificial tool, it was not the only one used on the Horse; for it was necessary, after all, to behead the victim. One would like to know more precisely how the weapon was handled. Did it only stop the victim in his tracks until he could be decapitated? Or did it finish him off? In the latter case, would there be a special value, or especially favorable omen, in dispatching him at the first cast? Polybius favors us only with the single word to describe the action: Ka7raKOVTL7 ELv, "to spear him down." Martial implications aside, this unusual implement was the one most suitable for an unusual kind of victim.26 Quite the opposite of the bul- 24 Lewis and Short, s.v., II.A; Kiihner-Stegmann3 2.53I.b.l. 25 Annie Leigh Broughton, "The Menologia Rustica," CPh 31 (1936) 355 f, n.I. 26 The human sacrifice to the Salaminian Agraulus was speared: Porph.

Wilhelm Mannhardt, Mythologische Forschungen (Quellen und Forschungen zur Sprach- und Kulturgeschichte der germanischen Vl1ker 51, Strassburg and London, 1884) 169, cites the spearing of a goat in Ovid, Amores 3.13.21. The example does not apply; it is simply a competitive goat hunt (like the rural American turkey shoot), with the animal to be kept by the winner. The spearing of the bull at the taurobolium, Prud. Perist. o.Ioz27, seems to be a relic of the rite's origin as a bull hunt: Robert Duthoy, The Taurobolium (Leiden, 1969), 124 f.</page><page sequence="8">268 C. Bennett Pascal lock, or some other ordinary hostia non invita, whose very tractability was a virtue, the October Horse was tested for its swiftness and valued for its high spirits. The usual sacrificial mallet would not only be an ignominious way to bring the victor in the race to his knees but could also conceivably diminish the value of the sacrifice. The spear itself, it may be noted, is a repository of magical power.27 It has a ritual importance in contexts where its martial use is all but forgotten, such as the setting up of the hasta for auctions and the use of the spear's head to part the hair of a bride.28 If the spear used to fell the October Horse was not already charged with magic, it is easy to imagine that horse's blood would lend it power to be used on some other occasion. (3) To be sure, there is no direct evidence that this particular horse was used to promote fertility or banish bad influences at the Parilia. However, inasmuch as the sacrifice of inedible victims was forever the exception, and the Romans abhorred horse's flesh,29 it would be difficult to imagine, without additional evidence, that the Parilia was the occasion for killing a second unsavory victim. It is sometimes carelessly inferred that the blood from the tail was to have been stored in the penus Vestae until the following spring.30 But Dumizil is right when he says that this is a virtual impossibility: the tail yields very little blood, and that little would have congealed long before it could be so used. He is also right in saying that the only use of the blood of the tail was to smear the hearth of the Regia; Plutarch (QR 97) implies as much when he writes that someone (he does not name a particular priest) 7I-Tv wu v l4~r alv r.

AJvamedha When Dumezil attempts to divest Mars and the sacrifice of their importance for fertility, or to divorce the October Horse from the Parilia, or to deduce, from the use of the spear in particular, a military significance for the ritual, he is setting the stage for a startling but seductive thesis: that the sacrifice of the October Horse is the Roman equivalent of the Vedic as'vamedha, and that both rituals have the same Indo-European ancestry.32 The similarities are certainly striking. The head of the Vedic horse is reserved for the king; in the Roman ritual there is the battle to decide whether or not the October Horse's head will be assigned to the King's house. Both customs point up a common motif: the head as an omen or talisman with royal or productive power.33 (If the point were to be pressed further, nailing the two mutineers' heads to the Regia in 46 B.c. would have religious importance as one of the devices whereby Caesar pressed his notorious pretensions to royalty.) There is also some importance assigned to the tail in the Vedic ceremony. The priest and sacrificer hold it, as if the horse were to guide them to heaven. While the head signifies spiritual energy, and the middle part physical force, the tail is said to stand for a prosperous yield of livestock. In both ceremonies the animal is selected with an eye to its energy and speed, qualities sought elsewhere in sacrificial horses.34 31 Fowler, Fest. 83: "the blood which streamed from the head of the horse." 32 Dumnzil, "Bellator Equos," Rdligion romaine, and REL 41:87-89 (see n.9, above); id., "Quaestiunculae indo-italicae 3: Le Cheval d'Octobre, bigarum victricum dexterior," REL 36 (1958) 130 f.

Bennett Pascal Persuasive as the similarities may be at first sight, they are superficial. In primitive societies sacrifices necessarily involved the king; he was their intermediary with the gods. It is not surprising that two different cultures which happened to have chosen the same kind of sacrificial beast are likely to have similar standards for its fitness. As for the par- tition of the victim, all that has been proved is that the Romans and the Indians both recognized that the horse had a front and a rear. The differences are more significant. Had one sacrifice been modeled on the other or from a common archetype, they would be expected to occupy similar places on the calendar, according to whether they celebrate sowing or harvest, equinox or solstice. In this case the date of the October Horse is fixed, but the asvamedha is movable and at a time far different from that of its sup- posed Roman counterpart: it is either in spring or summer.35 The Indian horse was chosen a year before its sacrifice, not, ap- parently, by means of a race and certainly not on the day of its slaughter. At the end of the acvamedha the victim was cooked and eaten.36 Had the Romans, for once, overcome their distaste for horse flesh, it surely would have been mentioned in at least one of the extant descriptions of the October Horse. The Vedic ceremony is by far the more elaborate of the two.37 Before the sacrifice, the victim is anointed and decorated by the king's wives as they apologize for its impending death.38 Afterward, the number-one wife takes the horse's phallus into her lap to simulate copulation, to the accompaniment of ribald shouts by the other wives and the priests.39 (This indecorous custom has been likened to the account of the Celtic coronation at Ulster. The high point of the ceremony was said to be the sexual union of the king with a white mare, but the gullible chronicler has passed along even taller tales.)40 35The long preparatory ceremony begins in February/March: Dumont (above, n.33), ii. 36 Dumont (above, n.33), 195, cooking of the flesh; 185, 199 f, 342, disposal of the blood. 37 Satapatha-Brahmana 13.1.9.9, 13.2.2.I-I3, 13.2.6.6-8, 13.2.8.4, 13.4-1.2-3; Carl Clemen, "Die Totung des Vegetationsgeistes in der r6mischen Religion," RhM n.f. 79 (I930) 335; K.

The avoidance of overt bloodletting may remind some readers of an "Unschuldskom6die," that is, a "Comedy of Innocence" wherein primitive hunting societies absolved themselves of the guilt and possible consequences of the deaths of the animals which they killed for their own sustenance43 - for example, the mock trial of the sacrificial knife used in the Athenian Buphonia.44 But the pretense of innocence is far from universal in the sacrificial ceremonies of classical peoples,45 least of all in the brutal sacrifice of the October Horse. Nor does it quite fit the afvamedha. Although there is an extravagant display of contrition for the impending bloodless execution, the horse is accompanied by 609 other victims of various species, for whom there seems to have been no (Rerum Britannicarum Medii Aevi Scriptores 21:5, London, 1867) 169.

At the farthest remove from the star attraction at the as:vamedha is the October Horse: the quickly dispatched offering to a god and the raw material for some later ceremony. III. Corn Spirit Greek mythology, which is no more than barely useful for explaining Roman religious practices, is a starting point for the inevitable chthonian explanations of the choice of a horse, among them, as might be expected, the connection between the horse and Mother Earth and Earth-Shaking Poseidon.47 Although the mingling of horse's blood with the ashes of the Fordicidia does justify some cautious chthonian inferences, the failure of the ancient authorities to mention a Ceres-Demeter or Neptune- Poseidon argues against such after-the-fact mythological etiology. The only divine participants in the October rite and its springtime sequel are, so far as is known or surmised, Mars, Vesta, and the obscure Pales. A most elaborate and, thanks to its promulgation by J. G. Frazer, influential attempt to define the place of the October Horse in the agri- cultural religion of Rome has been that of Wilhelm Mannhardt. His theory is that the horse, like other animals which are paraded or slain in rural pageants, is the theriomorphic embodiment of a Corn Spirit or Vegetation Daemon.48 He and his followers cite examples of horses' skulls thrown into May fires and midsummer St. John's fires, or hung from fir trees and lovers' doors, and the uses of horse bones or other parts of the horse, cat, hen, or any other domestic animal at planting, harvest, Whitsuntide, Shrove Tuesday, or any other important date on the religious or agricultural calendar.49 46 Dumont (above, n.33), 137-146. 47 Franz Altheim, Terra Mater: Untersuchungen zur altitalischen Religions- geschichte (Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten 22, Giessen, 1930) 121 f, i6o f. 48 Myth.Forsch., ch. 4, "Das Octoberross," 156-201; id., Wald- und Feldkulte (Berlin, 1875), 178, 185, 383, 411, 515; J.

In fact, Corn- Spirit theories are encumbered by an embarras de richesses, for it would seem that every important moment in the year of the farmer and re- ligious celebrant was celebrated somewhere by the use of almost every conceivable animal - including the horse - or its sundry parts, and of quite a variety of inanimate objects.53 Neither the Corn Spirit nor any other single theory is adequate to explain all the possible ceremonial objects. C. COMPONENTS OF THE RITE In its totality, the ceremony must have been built up over the genera- tions. Although the multiplicity of the succeeding layers is easier to discern than their chronological order,54 each element and step of the ceremony taken singly makes some kind of independent sense. I.

Bennett Pascal prove that it does not belong to a very old, pre-Republican stratum of religion, for there are some ancient holidays which, because they co- incide with the Ides, do not appear on the oldest calendars.55 Yet even with this concession, it is doubtful that the October Horse enjoyed very much seniority among Roman sacrifices. It, unlike other celebra- tions which fall on the Ides, is not found in the additamenta of inscribed calendars subsequent to the hypothetical Calendar of Numa.56 The earliest calendar entry is the meager equus fit in the manuscript of the fourth-century Fasti of Philocalus.57 II. The Horse There is evidence for the sacrifice of horses in Europe as far back as the neolithic era.58 In historical times, the best-known horse sacrifices were made by the Persians to the Sun.59 Persians and Greeks were known to cast teams whole into the sea as offerings to Poseidon or his equivalent, or to have substituted horses for other victims as &amp;SafcapTa, to ensure safe river crossing.60 Horses were said to have been sacrificed as a prelude to battle6' and at regular occasions at heroes' tombs.62 Aside from its having occurred in the general neighborhood of the Tiber, the October ritual bears no similarity to any of the other sacrifices at bodies of water, let alone those on the battlefield or at tombs.

It is actually tabu, for example, in the case of the Flamen Dialis, for reasons which may have less to do with magic than simple archaism.6" Most of the technical vocabulary of horsemanship and the words for horse-drawn vehicles are not Latin."6 (It is possible that conservatism also dictated the exclusion of horses from the grove of Diana at Nemi.)65 The horse was not an important agricultural animal in classical Rome.66 Not being a normal part of either the Greeks' nor the Romans' regular diet, it was not ordinarily suitable for sacrifice.67 The slaughter of the even less edible dog at the Lupercalia and Robigalia provides the exception which can very well prove the rule. Whereas the blood of the October Horse increases fertility where it is applied, the blood and entrails of dogs were useful for an opposite reason: apotropaic "bad medicine," to protect the corn from rust and the walls of the city from wolves or other malign influences.68 The curtus equus mentioned by Propertius seems not to have been an original feature of the Parilia; so much is implied by nunc curto lustra novantur equo in his brief mention. Although the horse's blood and the ashes from the Fordicidia, contributing to a fumigant, were not actually sacrifices at the Parilia, the testimony of Plutarch (Rom. 12), that the Parilia was originally celebrated with bloodless sacrifices, gives rise to the suspicion that these were not original elements in the celebration. The preliminary horse race, by all plausible reckoning, cannot be older than a sixth-century importation from Magna Graecia.69 63 Walter Potscher, Mnemosyne ser. 4, vol. 2z (1968), p. 218 f; Festus 71 L; Gellius 10.15.3 f; Serv. Aen. 8.552; Plut. QR 40. Pliny, NH 18.9.40.146, gives a spurious reason. The horse seems also to have been forbidden to the Dictator, except after passage of special legislation: Livy 23.14.2; Plut. Fab. 4.

Bennett Pascal If it were to turn out that some other animal had originally been sacrificed on the Ides of October, the substitution of the Horse or the addition of its blood to some other religious objects need cause no great surprise. Although we have been taught to expect scrupulous, step-by-step adherence to procedure in the grand official rituals, there are examples of improvisation and latitude in the choice of a cheaper or, mutatis mutandis, more impressive victim, especially in peripheral ceremonies that found no place in the official Fasti. At the coming of spring, for example, Horace enjoins honors to Faunus, with the sacrifice either of a lamb or a kid (C. 1.4.11 f). To Tibullus, the sign of decline in a farm's prosperity is the substitution of a lamb for a heifer (1.1.21- 22). Other religions provide ready examples of the substitution of victims.70 III. The Blood At the center of the Roman ceremony, and distinguishing it from those with which it is often compared, is the unusual manner of anoint- ing the royal hearth with the Horse's blood. The hypothesis that a second horse was slaughtered for the Parilia is unnecessary, for there was abundant blood in the remainder of the carcass.71 Nor, by the same token, is there need of the more recent, ingenious theory that the celebrants amputated not the tail but a member which would yield more blood - namely, the penis.72 If the ancient descriptions do not tell what was done with the rest of the horse after the removal of head and tail, that is hardly surprising. Such accounts as we have, after all, are not drawn from complete handbooks of ritual but from brief, ad-hoc notices of certain peculiar 70 E.g., replacement of the taurobolium by the cheaper criobolium; Jewish approximation of the scapegoat in East Europe, by lambasting the kapparah, a hen or cock: Kaufmann Kohler, The Jewish Encyclopedia VII (New York, 1904) 435 f. 71 Wilhelm Mannhardt, Der Baumkultus der Germanen und ihrer Nachbar- stdmme (Berlin, 1875) 402 ff, describes the St. Stephen's Ride of December 26, which ends with drawing blood from the horse's veins for later therapeutic purposes. Eitrem, Beitrdge (above, n.13), 20. 72 George Devereux, "The Equus October Ritual Reconsidered," Mnemosyne ser. 4, vol. 23 (1970), pp. 297-301, offers interesting physiological information about the relative supply of blood provided by the tail and penis, respectively, with the conclusion that the penis was carried to the Regia. The force of the argument is weakened by the empirical proof obtained by Dumizil, Fetes, 185-187, that the tail could be amputated, carried the necessary distance, and still yield enough blood to stain the altar.</page><page sequence="17">October Horse 277 features of the rite. The disposal of those parts of the victim not used in the more remarkable stages of the sacrifice would be ordinary routine, just as commonly known and seldom mentioned as the mundane after- math of a modern bullfight (distribution of the meat to the poor). In the case of the Roman sacrifice, since the horse is not commonly edible, it is reasonable to assume that it was ultimately consumed in a holocaust.73 The ashes could have been thrown into the Tiber, if other known horse sacrifices or, for that matter, the legends about the con- secration of the Campus Martius are precedents; or they could have been mixed into the suffimen of the Parilia.74 The six-month preservation of blood and ashes for religious purposes is no more remarkable than the modern custom of pickling and saving for the following spring part of the calf or goat killed at the end of the harvest.75 The important element is the Horse's blood. The "good medicine" contained therein is something common to Roman religion and all other primitive religions, in both the magico-religious and the narrowly therapeutic sense (as, for example, the curative powers of a spear or any weapon wet with human blood).76 It is the Old-Testament "life of the flesh," or nefesh, Latin anima, and Greek psyche.77 Some such power has been recognized in the Melanesian mana (the common modern label), in the American-Indian orenda, and, by classical scholars, in numen, whose popular etymology is the divine "nod" but may ultimately be akin to an Indo-European verb "to move." Although there has been some scholarly opposition to the use of numen as an all-inclusive ex- planation of pre-deistic religion, the concept has been useful for under- standing both some primitive and some ostensibly more sophisticated 73 Mannhardt, Myth.Forsch., 158 f. 74 Prop. 4.. 19 f (lustra novantur equo) mentions the horse, not its blood.

The insistence by Dum6zil, Fetes, 188-203, that blood is valuable only as a "corrosive" remover of impurities utilizes only a small fraction of the evidence available. 77 Leviticus 16:19, 16:33 et al.; Trumbull, The Blood Covenant; Franz Rilsche, Blut, Leben und Seele: Ihr Verhaltnis nach Auffassung der griechischen und hellenistischen Antike, der Bibel, und der alexandrinischen Theologen (Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Altertums, Erganzungsband 5, Paderborn, 1930), a painstaking and internally consistent philological systematization of the concept in mythology and ancient medical literature.

Numen resides in certain things and places: doorposts and thresholds, hearths, boundary stones, betyls, and altars. The power can be reinforced or transferred to per- sons, things, and even gods - recharging a battery may be a useful comparison - by means of the application of certain potent materials: to cite a few, oil, wine, sacrificial fat or smoke, and, of course, blood. The power-reinforcing principle of many primitive sacrifices has been recognized even by scholars who have not adopted such stylish terms as mana or numen, and it shows through in such ancient locutions as aram augere, "trrvpa a4Etwv, and macte hoc vino or suovetaurilibus.79 The use of blood to instill numen into a thing is illustrated by the establishment and annual renewal of Terminus, the boundary marker80- not an anthropomorphic god, but important for territorial and social stability - and in libations onto the hearth, which has come just short of an anthropomorphic personality as the goddess Vesta. The transfer of numinous power to persons has its example in the drinking of blood by seers in order to get oracular vision.81 The October Horse, whatever other importance he may have had, is a source of such powerful, numinous stuff. The blood added to the April fires recharges the numen of the people and animals coming into contact with the smoke, if not to increase their fertility, then to fortify their resistance to the diseases and hazards of the coming growing season. The hearth or altar at the Regia (focus in Festus, wlcWl in Plutarch) is an important recipient of the numen of the blood.82 78 H.

It also lends some sense to the running, racing, and battling which attend the sacrifice of the Horse. The traditional interpretation of the need for the race of the two-horse teams would be that the fastest horse would be the gift most fitting to the anthropomorphic god, usually the Sun.83 But to put it in more elemental terms, the horse with the greatest physical strength would also carry the strongest charge of numen.84 To stop him in mid- career, drawing the first drops of blood with a weapon which perhaps itself was loaded with magical force, would be to catch the numen at its highest pitch. IV. The Head and the Mamilii The regal associations of the horse's head in the advamedha suggest (but do not assure) a meaning for one event in the ceremony of the October Horse. The battle for the head is fought, after all, to see whether it will reside on the Tower of the Mamilii or the King's house. This has been explained as a sham battle to set the stronghold of the Mamilii on equal terms with the royal residence,85 but it could well be the residue of serious claims by the Mamilii to royal prerogatives. We don't know where the Mamilian tower was, although there is epigraphical assurance that it did exist.86 We do know something about the family of the Mamilii, who are reputed to have given the tower its name,87 and who in historical times still retained a reminder of the 1914, Christiania Dybwad, 1915) 430; Porph.

Bennett Pascal turris Mamilia in the cognomen Turrinus.88 The clan comes from Tusculum, traces mythical origins to Telegonus and Circe, and recalls a connection by marriage to the Tarquins. Octavius, who was killed in the service of Tarquin the Proud at Lake Regillus, had, because of his pre-eminence among the Latins, been chosen as his son-in-law. He had earlier given his father-in-law refuge after his expulsion from Rome and had proved to be adept, either by reason of his powers of persuasion or his inherited prestige, at correcting Tarquin's diplomatic gaffes among the Latin allies. When, therefore, the Mamilii or latter-day partisans strive to capture the head of the October Horse, there seems to have been a historical basis to their claim to this emblem of royalty. The family was foremost among Rome's Latin neighbors, both during and after the regal period, and at Rome could boast a royal prestige matching that of the Tarquins, yet without suffering the odium that adhered to the name of Tarquin. For during the subsequent history of the City they had rendered con- spicuous service to the Republic. It was a Lucius Mamilius from their home base at Tusculum, for instance, who in 458 B.C. was credited with having rescued the Capitolium from the Aequi and Volsci.89 Why the battle-royal of the Mamilii was set precisely on the Ides of October is likely never to be known. Yet, thanks to the affection to which they legitimately laid claim, the annual renewal of their claim to the benefit of the sacrifice of the Horse would incur no undue rancor. If the head were nothing more than a royal emblem, it would be hard to justify its importance to a sacrifice which was performed ob frugum eventum. However, a broader significance can be surmised. Heads of sacrificial animals (frequently accompanied by feet), bou- crania on Greco-Roman altars, heads in folklore, head-hunting among primitive tribes, and the head cropping up in oaths, curses, and other casual contexts - I swear by my children's heads! vae capiti tuo! - all furnish ample and frequently utilized material for theories about the magico-religious importance of the head.90 Yet even without recourse to these, and without the benefit of the growth of anatomical knowledge which isolates the function of the brain, the head is an easily identifiable 88 Livy 28.10.3, 8; Fasti Capitolini for 239 B.C., CIL 12, p. 24 (Insc.It. 13:1, p. 42 f).

Aug. 7. 89 To regard the Mamilii only as traditional enemies of Rome, as does Dumezil, Fetes, 14-56, seems to be an improper emphasis, attaching as it does an excessively high hazard to the battle for the head. A victory of the "enemy" would be an omen as inconceivably bad as if Guy Fawkes were to escape the bonfire. 90 S.

Roman mythology also mentions the horse's head as an omen of fer- tility.91 With fertility medicine residing in the loaf-crowned head of the October Horse, its possession would replicate or supplement the effect already produced by bloodying the hearth with the severed tail. But in a ceremony which seems to have grown in stages, such redundancy is quite possible. V.

It is perhaps stretching a point to assume that the physical effort of the sprint from the Campus Martius is in itself meant to load the tail with additional numen.92 It could be, rather, that the purpose is to solicit the favorable omen of the most ample yield possible, under deliberately difficult conditions. It has been argued that tails contain a special kind of fructifying or magical power.93 The most impressive argument is the more than three- dozen extant Mithraic tauroctonus reliefs where the tail of the bull sprouts from one to seven ears of grain.94 Whatever may be the myth that these sculptures represent, the tip of the tail is not the only source of magically produced cereal. In one relief, the grain protrudes not from the tail but from a wound in the bull's flank.95 Less compelling arguments for the unique powers of the tail are the mention of tail-grasping in the advamedha and depictions of tail- grasping attendants on Greek equestrian tomb reliefs. In such cases, holding the tail can be no more than the means for a pedestrian to aid g" Harry M.

Bennett Pascal his flagging steps when there is only one mount available to two travelers.96 It is hardly surprising - indeed, it is almost inevitable - that some- one call the tail a symbol or substitute for the Horse's phallus.97 Never- theless, even in a post-Freudian climate of the free exercise of the imagination, the burden of proof for a symbolic interpretation must be borne by the symbolists. The ancient testimony says that a tail, not a penis, was carried to the Regia. It is true that the Greeks and Romans used the euphemisms cauda and o'pdc, just as Germans still say Schwanz. Yet these words are slang, appropriate to the language of comedy and satire, not to the prosaic, even dry, reports of a religious ceremony.98 Plutarch and Festus were guilty neither of levity nor so inordinate a degree of delicacy that they would not have called the phallus by its literal name. Nor is there any reason to suppose that modesty or a sense of pro- priety compelled the celebrants to use a tail in the place of a phallus for the dash from Campus Martius to Regia. Genuine phalli, or accurate representations of them, are a familiar enough feature of public ritual. The dismemberment of animals and employment of their aesthetically less pleasing parts for sacrifice and prophecy could often be very untidy affairs, but never a deterrent from the faithful completion of every step of the process or its accurate representation in art. There is surely no need of iconographic euphemism in the case of the grain-sprouting tail of the Mithraic bull, for example; for the bull on many tauroctonus reliefs suffers the indignity and agony of a scorpion grasping his testicles. Although the Romans kept a cautious rein on licentious behavior, even 96 Wagenvoort, "Mag. Bedeut." (above, n.93), 283, briefly concedes herds- men's use of a horse's or cow's tail to help ford a stream. Cf. the use by Ariovistus's infantry of horses' manes to speed their steps: Caesar BG 1.48.7. U.S. cavalry- men were known to dismount and support themselves by holding their mounts' tails on particularly rough terrain during the tranquilization of the American Southwest. 97 E.g., Meuli, "Ursprung der Olymp.

Such expressions are as comic and frivolous as the modern slang meaning of Schwanz, as is illustrated by Devereux's and other examples: Eustathius ad II. I 1.558, p. 862.42, Devarius; cf. Hor.

After all, for a cere- mony to be effective, the real thing had to be used. If a tail was carried to the Regia, a tail was all that was intended. Without its being a substitute for the phallus, the tail could have a magico-religious importance all its own. But so, for that matter, could practically every portion of the anatomy, if one browses far enough afield in the relevant literature.100 If a simple, admittedly prosaic reason be sought for the tail's importance, one need only watch a horse flicking flies or a dog caught up in a moment of emotional transport. Here, possessed by nonhuman mammals, is an organ which seems to have a life and will all its own. There is also a practical side to the tail's importance. It is portable and decorative. Furthermore, that very meagerness of blood which has perplexed those scholars who boast a modicum of physiological know- ledge would also add to the dramatic suspense of the ritual of the libation on the hearth. Readily grasped by the runner, the tossing plume would be easily visible to spectators along the route of its frantic progress to the Forum. At the Regia, it is easy to imagine with what bated breath the participants waited until the few available drops of blood splashed onto the surface of the hearth. Other more abundant libations and offerings would have been made here in the course of the year. But on this one occasion, the very difficulties would be the reason for attempt- ing this strange mode of numen-enhancement. For it is not hard to think of private games, artificial obstacles, or little challenges to unseen powers to elicit good omens. Robert Bruce's wager with the spider comes to mind; and there are other more public rituals, such as attribut- ing to the quick, clean breaking of the goblet beneath the groom's heel at a Jewish wedding a prophetic importance which was not originally there. It is easy to imagine, then, that the officiating priests would have recruited the swiftest runner and most artful tail-squeezer or shaker. The greater the number of drops of blood, the better the omen for the prosperity of the King's house and the City. VI.

The only deities clearly connected with the rites are Vesta, in whose store- room the blood was kept, and on whom (that is, the hearth) the blood was dripped, and the obscure Pales, to whose festival the senior Vestal Virgin brought the blood. Yet, both Festus and Plutarch say that the Horse was sacrificed to Mars. Timaeus, as quoted by Polybius, simply says that a war horse is speared in the Campus Martius. The October Horse is the only horse which the Romans are said to have sacrificed to Mars, although horses along with other victims are said to have been offered by the barbarians to their equivalents of Ares.101 At first sight, the mention of Mars' name looks like an inference from the given information that the sacrifice was made on the Field of Mars, and that the animal was a martial steed. The feeling is reinforced by the confused non sequitur in the epitome of Paulus, that a horse was sacri- ficed for the production of fruges, because the customary bullock is suited to fruges, and the horse to war. There seems here to be an inept attempt to reconcile the obvious anomalies of the involvement in an agricultural ceremony of Mars militaris and an animal with little or no use in agriculture.102 Yet, the naive ancient attempt to find a place for the Hellenized Mars-Ares in an agricultural ceremony need not obscure Mars' appro- priateness to ceremonies which involve Vesta, the Regia, and the production of grain. Spears of Quirinus were kept in the Regia.103 On the first day of Mars' month, the old New Year's Day marked on the Fasti Praenestini as Feriae Marti, the fire of Vesta was renewed, and fresh laurels were affixed to the Regia.104 Mars can also have been involved in the procurement of bean straw for the fires at the Parilia. Ioannes Lydus reports that the bean is 101 Hdt. 4.62: Scythian sacrifices of horses and other animals to Ares, with no apparent distinction of victims; Strabo 3.3.7 (p. 155): Lusitanian sacrifices of goats, humans, and horses; Ps.-Callisthenes 3.25.9: horses to Poseidon and Hephaestos. 102 Fritz Schachermeyr, Poseidon und die Entstehung des griechischen G6tter- glaubens (Bern, 1950), 91 f, sees a development of Roman Mars from the centaur-like Mcdp-g.

The Place Although the ceremonies culminate at the Regia, they tend mostly to skirt the oldest part of Rome. They begin at the Campus Martius, which is outside the pomerium, and have importance for the Sacra Via, which in earliest times was too marshy for habitation, and the relatively distant Subura.108 The locus of events is oddly random. Most other religious celebra- tions are usually set either in single public places or simultaneously in public places and private households. That is to say, a particular holiday can have a public ceremony at the Capitolium, the Regia, or the Pons Sublicius, with analogous private ceremonies at thresholds, hearths, tombs, or the compita. By way of contrast, the rites of the October Horse meander from Campus Martius to Regia, from Sacra Via to Subura, and, depending on the outcome of the battle for the head, back to the Regia or Subura. According to the Calendar of Philocalus, the Horse was sacrificed on the northern part of the Campus Martius, near the ciconiae nixae, apparently a statuary group of storks.109 The approximate location is 105 De Mensibus 4.42. 106 Clemen, "T6tung" (above, n.37), 333. 107 Cato Agr. 141-3; also noticed by Alfred von Domaszewski, Abhandlungen zur r6mischen Religion (Leipzig and Berlin, 1909; repr. 1975, New York), 124 = Westdeutsche Zeitschrift 24.76, where his purpose is to delineate the function of the deified Bonus Eventus. 108 H.

The sacrifice of the Horse and the conveyance of the tail took place on terrain that was overlaid with more than two millennia of human habitation and layer upon layer of religious and mythological tradition. The western corner of the Campus was the site of the altar of Dis buried at the Tarentum (or Terentum), where the Ludi Tarentini, later called the Ludi Saeculares, took place.111 The most familiar legend of the consecration of the Campus Martius, with the jettisoning of Tarquin's grain into the Tiber, suggests one of the likely ways of disposing of the Horse's remains.112 The other stories of the discovery of the subterranean altar of Disll3 and the donation of the Tarentum by the Vestal Tarquinia or Gaia Taracia or Acca stantinopolitanarum I (Leipzig, 1901) ii.

D. EVOLUTION OF THE RITE The ancient accounts of the sacrifice of the October Horse give the superficial impression that the whole ceremony was a unity whose parts were all essential to each other. Modern holistic theories of its signifi- cance have in one way or another perpetuated this tradition of a mono- lithic unity but have each, for one reason or another, been invalidated by at least one irreconcilable discrepancy between ad-hoc theory and the realities of Roman religion in general or the October rite in par- ticular. The agricultural and domestic importance of the rite contradicts the assertion that it was a military lustration, despite a couple of general observations that horses are suited to war. Everything that is known or can be surmised about the treatment and disposition of this or any Roman victim dispels the notion that it was the chief persona in some such religious drama as the aivamedha or the annual killing of the Corn God. Rather than try to impose an artificial unity on the rites of October, it makes more sense to see in them a reconciliation of several elements coming from different sources. Such amalgamations of festivals are common enough to suggest the possibility of some such hybridization in the October sacrifice itself. Inscribed calendars of a relatively late date show that the Ides of October was a traditionally important agricultural date, not only for the wheat farmer but also for the vintner."15 In a primitive community the day's sacrifices would naturally involve the king, and later the rex sacrificulus. Part of the numen-enhancing blood of the sacrifice would be applied to his hearth. A later elaboration of the ritual would be the reservation of part of the blood for the Parilia by the Vestal Virgins, who were surrogates for the archaic King's daughters. 114 Donation of Campus Martius by Tarquinia: Plut.

Bennett Pascal The sacrifice at the ciconiae nixae, however, may not have originally been part of the state's ceremonial cycle but rather of the family cultus of the gens Mamilia. This can be inferred both from omissions in the data and some positive clues. None of the surviving documents tells what public priest or magis- trate performed the sacrifice. It is possible that none did; for Polybius, describing the act, says, o70i 'PPwoa1ov9 ... KaTaKov7T Eiv. The omission of hiereus or some official title need not have been an accident. The spearing could have been done by a member of the clan; or perhaps several competed in a spear-throwing contest to see who would make the telling cast. None of the extant inscribed calendars contains the October Horse among the small-lettered additamenta whereby important religious occasions that fell on the Ides were recorded. It is found only in a rela- tively late manuscript. An easy inference is that although the festival of the Mamilian clan attained local celebrity outside the pomerium and even ultimately contributed to the suffimen of the Parilia, it never attained an importance equal to that of other State ceremonies. A dramatic interval in the celebration of the private cult would have been the annual attempt of the Mamilii to vaunt their past glory and re- assert their claim to the royal sacrificial prerogatives which they could have claimed to have inherited from the Tarquins, but which had passed over to the rex sacrificulus, who now occupied the Regia, or to its later occupant, the Pontifex Maximus. Indeed, the sacrifice by the ciconiae nixae could have been an occasion for the flare-up of rivalries between families and neighborhoods traditionally associated with the respective claimants to the old prerogatives, not entirely unlike some modern holy days and patriotic holidays, when local authorities deem it prudent to put extra police reserves on the alert. A high point in the drama would have been the battle for the head of the victim - in the early days, particularly if the sacrifice was originally a holocaust, possibly the con- ventional bullock. When the innovation of chariot racing was added to such entertain- ment as would be normal to the occasion, it would have been a welcome substitute for some of the rowdier activities. One of the teams, it may be imagined, was entered by the Mamilii. In other holidays, it is not unusual that a traditional sport or dish (such as the anachronistic potato pancakes on Chanukkah or the Christmas fruitcake) or some other custom habitually maintained year after year will eventually be popularly regarded as having its own religious importance, essential to the proper observance of the ritual. Thus the race became an essential part of the ritual at the ciconiae nixae, the best of the steeds replaced the conven-</page><page sequence="29">October Horse 289 tional victim; all the things that had been done to the original victim, culminating with the usurpation of the sacrifice by the occupant of the Regia, were done to the Horse; and the October Horse itself provided the name by which the otherwise unnamed event is remembered.116 It is a commonplace of religious history for occasions so to evolve or so to imbue the coloration of the concomitant events that they bear little resemblance to their original form. The prominence lent to St. John's Day by its proximity to the summer solstice has resulted in a gala outside the Lateran church, with feasting on snails and pork sandwiches. The reciprocal influences of the Saturnalia, Germanic solstitial festivals, Christmas, and Chanukkah are familiar. Roman re- ligion provides the example of the Quinquatrus, where the coincidence of the festival of Mars and the natalis of Minerva gave rise to an after- the-fact etiological myth."' With these and other analogies coming readily to mind, it is not hard to imagine that the sacrifice of the October Horse and its attendant ceremonies are a hybrid, whose most memorable procedures are perhaps the most foreign. The contention that all this October activity originated with a festival of the Mamilii has one clear analogy. Within easy walking distance of the ciconiae nixae there is another example of one clan's success in gaining national prominence for its own cult, and of that cult's affinity for foreign accretions. The legends and cultus of the underground altar of Dis at the Tarentum contribute to the prominence of the gens Valeria: Valesius, its founder, later to be called Manius Valerius, and Valerius Poplicola, founder of the Ludi Tarentini. The altar seems originally to have been a family shrine,1xs originally the scene of the occasional procuratio of untoward prodigies and soon augmented with procedures which are mostly foreign innovations: the computation of the saeculum by an Etruscan scheme of reckoning, Greek gods (including the Dis and 116 E.g., Memorial Day is commonly called Decoration Day.

Their annual attempt to re-assert their traditional dignity seems originally to have taken the form of a genuine brawl between the Sacravienses, who lived nearer to and sup- ported the Regia, and the Suburenses, who must have felt some ties to the Mamilii, possibly because they lived near the turris Mamilia. In- evitably there have been attempts to attach religious importance to such regular battles-royal wherever they occur, but such attempts are no better than guesses.'20 The battle for the Horse's head seems to have been nothing else than just the kind of local riot that the Romans were anxious to keep under control.121 There is a clear and more recent example of such a formalization and the superimposition of religion onto a popular contest in the Sienese Palio, where twice each year the rivalries of the city's districts, the contrade, effloresce in a rough-and-tumble horse race.122 Its precursors were bullfights and other animal games and bruising battles between helmeted, club-wielding gangs. Its present form includes a strangely normalized tradition of skulduggery, with bribery of the jockeys and doping of the horses before the race and unrestrained mayhem during the running.

The example does not apply, for aside from the confusion of expiatio with lustratio, Servius's account is a contrived etiology for what must originally have been either funeral games or a hero cult.

But by the time of the first written accounts and regulations in the twelfth century, religion had already intruded into its observance, so that the present-day celebration includes special masses, offerings of candles to the local Madonna, consecration of the contestants in the contrada's own church, and rituals involving every member of the contrada. The evolution of disparate celebrations like those at the Tarentum and in Siena give an idea of the range and variety of courses of develop- ment which were open to the original fertility and numen-increasing sacrifice at the ciconiae nixae. Whether or not the Mamilii were origin- ally the sole proprietors of the sacrifice - for the one-time mention of the turris Mamilia is the sole prop to this assumption - the later fortunes of the Ludi Tarentini show how a local or private rite can attain national importance and ultimately be so overlaid with innovations and foreign additions as to have little similarity to the prototype. The race at Siena shows how an essentially secular custom like a tug-of-war or a horse race can be incorporated in existing cult practices and gain a spurious religious significance. In sum, the ceremony which was described by Polybius, Plutarch, Verrius Flaccus, and his epitomizer, Festus, seems to have attracted attention less for its intrinsic importance to the City and the State than for its picturesque uniqueness. The composite ritual is not a replica of some archaic Roman or Indo-European model but the result of an already long evolution and a string of fortuitous innovations.124 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, EUGENE 123 Dundes-Falassi (above, n.122), p. 56. 124 An earlier draft of this paper has benefited in several details from a sympathetic and learned reading by Professor Jerzy Linderski.</page></plain_text>
