<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREENING ORGANIZATIONS Purchasing, Consumption, and Innovation KEN GREEN BARBARA MORTON University or Manchester Institute or Science and Technology STEVE NEW University of Oxford The use of consumer pressure in greening the economy has long been advocated by environ mentalists. This article takes the view that the traditional image of the consumer as the pri mary agent of environmental change is inadequate. Efforts to green the economy require an understanding of corporations and public organizations as consumers as well as an understanding of individuals as consumers. The article sets out the arguments for treating all organizations as consumers and as a dominant but underemphasized force in greening the economy. It then considers organizational consumption in the context of supply chains, with respect to the issue of agency within the organization and with respect to the transmissions of market signals for innovation. The discussion makes clear the importance of considering the interorganizational context and ways in which this context both constrains and enables green purchasing initiatives. Reference is made to examplesfrom a range of organizations. In this article, we examine some previously ignored connections between organizational purchasing and innovation in the context of the greening of organizations. We build an argument around the image of organizations as con sumers to highlight this profound yet underappreciated source of environmental impact. In developing the argument, we problematize the issue of collective agency as it relates to organizations. We ask, "Who is the consumer?" and "What do con sumers do?" Despite the thriving field of research in organizational purchasing, it remains tempting to slip into a rather easy and prescriptive anthropomorphism when explaining what organizations do when they buy things. Here, we use the interplay between concepts of the individual consumer and concepts of the organi zational consumer as a way to explicate some key ideas about the greening of con sumption. We use these ideas as a platform for considering how various Authors' Note: Parts of this article have been presented at the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Seminar on Consump tion, Environment and the Social Sciences, Oxford University, UK, July 1998; the Science Policy Research Unit Seminar, University of Sussex, June 1998; and the DRUID Winter Conference, Copenhagen, January 1999.

We also consider what goes on inside individual organizations as they receive and respond to external market signals that are proenvironmental. It is our contention that any attempt to reduce levels of consumption as part of a program for global environmental improvement needs to consider two things: con sumption by organizations and the innovative activities of organizations, especially their ability to develop new products and processes. Organizations, whether public or private, are major discretionary consumers. Their purchasing will, therefore, be significant with regard to the depletion of resources and impacts of production (including incident pollution and waste) carried out by the organizations from which they buy—and this continues on throughout the range of interorganizational chains and networks. There is clearly scope for intervention in greening these chains and networks through changing how and what organizations consume. This can be achieved both by changing how companies purchase and by changing the processes of organizational innovation. Such interventions are obviously limited, however, by the power that individual organizations have as they are embedded in various chains and networks, but there is no doubt that there is room to green the process of organizational purchasing and that there is much pressure for it. It would be no exaggeration to say that there are currently many more opportunities for pro fessional management commitment to green consumption and innovation than there are for greening end-user consumption. In the first section below, we explore the view that the traditional image of the consumer is inadequate, both for theorizing in the social sciences and especially for considering the environmental challenge of greening organizations and the econ omy. For theory, attempts to interpret the world, which rely on the established mod els of consumers contra industry and organizations (especially corporations), are, in our view, unhelpful. Keeping to such explicit or implicit models means that efforts to green the economy are bound to falter without the recognition of organi zations and individuals as consumers. In the second section, we elaborate the theme of greening organizational consumption by focusing attention on some key organi zational and interorganizational processes. In particular, we introduce the impor tant concept of a supply chain and discuss interrelationships between such chains, environmental impacts, and product and process innovations in organizations. We conclude by tying these threads together and briefly discussing implications for future research and for the practical side of greening organizational purchasing. CONSUMING ORGANIZATIONS Consumption: A Frail Convergence? Recently, there has been an explosion of interest in the broad phenomenon of consumption. This has resulted in an exciting convergence of disciplinary interests: Economists, historians, sociologists, psychologists, and even management theo rists have trundled around each others' aisles and enthusiastically swept brightly packaged conceptual goods into their intellectual shopping trolleys.1 This coming together is a genuine example of cross-boundary intellectual work, and there is much to commend it. The convergence is possible because all can gather around the apparently unifying idealized image of the consumer, which appears meaningful and comprehensible to all of the disciplines. However, is this image adequate? We think not.</page><page sequence="3">208 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 First, in terms of the scale of economic activity, personal traditional (end) con sumption very probably is dwarfed by the spending of public and private organiza tions. Sales between organizations—in which one organization will sell and the other will buy (and then consume in some way)—are of major importance in any economy. Unfortunately, the definitional problems we outline below do not allow an easy estimate of the ratio of interorganizational sales to end-consumer sales from conventional economic statistics; furthermore, the ratio will vary over time with the degree of vertical integration in the economy. Nevertheless, it is easy to see how for a given item the sum of its intermediate prices, as it progresses down the supply chain, will exceed the final price charged to the final consumer. Yet, in most writ ings on consumption, typically the consumer is seen as an individual, passively making choices between brands; this is often contrasted with a concept of produc tion or industry, which conjures up pictures of smoking factories or lumbering agri cultural machinery. The simplistic and dualistic imagery of these traditional mod els does not stand scrutiny and limits and confuses the debate. Some Definitional Problems In recent years, the discipline of economics has come to be blamed for skewer ing intellectual progress by its reliance on simplistic and mathematically biased assumptions and its abandonment of reality and empirical challenge with a flight to theoretical elegance (e.g., see Lawson, 1997). Consumption is one area that has been particularly fraught with contention and controversy, and this perhaps has to do with the fundamental difficulty of defining the term. Boulding (1948) is in no doubt that "The process of consumption... is th &amp; final [italics added] act in the eco nomic drama" (p. 614) and that the consumer is "the supreme mover of the eco nomic order... for whom all goods are made and toward whom all economic activ ity is directed" (p. 613). Rather less grandly, Gregory (1987) characterizes this view of consumption as "the dead end of a one-way avenue." Problems arise, however, when the precise meaning of the term is required. Boulding (1948) (selected here as an influential and typical example) collapses into a tautological loop: "Consumers are people who consume . . . and consumption is ... what consumers do." To overcome this, a series of ill-defined and effectively ad hoc qualifications are offered, such as the ultimate consumer being defined as "organisms which buy not in order to sell again, but in order to consume and enjoy; families and orphanages fall into this class" (p. 17). One page later, this is expanded to the following: "Every individual who has to spend money in the purchase of commodities for consumption is an ultimate consumer" (p. 18). This identification of an economic process with an economic actor causes significant definitional problems: producers who consume raw materials to make products are deemed then to have their production netted off, to give a value of net production, and house holds who also produce stop being a consumer proper and may need to be consid ered quasi-enterprises or have their activities divided according to some conven tion, a situation which is "far from satisfactory" (p. 291) and to which "a satisfactory definition has not been found" (p. 742). More recent texts are often less candid about the conceptual difficulties that lie behind the elegant curves of standard theories. Sloman (1994) defines consumption as "the act of using goods and services to satisfy wants," which "will normally involve purchasing the goods and services" (p. 1), but fails to give a clear explana tion of the consumer. This is typical. In a straw poll of seven dictionaries of eco nomics, six (Bannock, Baxter, &amp; Davis, 1992; Eatwell, Milgate, &amp; Newman, 1987;</page><page sequence="4">Green et al. / GREENING ORGANIZATIONS 209 Greenwald, 1994; Knopf, 1991;Livesey, 1993; Rutherford, 1992) omit an entry for consumer; Pearce (1992) is an exception: "Any economic agent responsible for the act of consuming final goods and services. Typically, the consumer is thought of as an individual, but in practice will consist of institutes, individuals and groups of individuals." However, the rest of his description concerns households only. This is a tricky but significant problem, as theories of consumption play a major role in several branches of economics. Hollander (1986) points out that the devel opment of the subject as a mathematically oriented discipline was crucially affected by the development of the theory of consumption, and this rests on the need for dif ferentiating economic actors into categories of shared behavior. It is clear that eco nomics has not always considered the obvious lack of homogeneity in motivations and behaviors. Economics also has not been concerned that the aggregate analysis presents a picture that corresponds to any particular reality; that is, the detail of what a firm actually does is, in an important way, not the point. Machlup ( 1967) has commented, To confuse the firm as a theoretical construct with the firm as an empirical concept, that is, to confuse a heuristic fiction with a real organization like General Motors or Atlantic and Pacific is to commit the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness." (as cited in Sawyer, 1993, p. 22) This would not be an issue were it not for the fact that, in many ways, economics has preconditioned the terms of discourse about consumption; that is, sociologists and economics can share some of the same terms (notably, perhaps, the term con sumer sovereignty) and mean quite different things. Debates about consumption have tended to accept the connection that when we talk about consumption, we talk about the behavior of individuals as consumers, when many of the interesting issues that emerge from research and reflection in fact apply just as interestingly at the organizational level. It is true that the restricted notion of consumption that we have rehearsed is less common in accounts of environmental consumption (see Charter, 1992; Elkington &amp; Hailes, 1998; Irvine, 1989; National Research Council [NRC], 1997; Wagner, 1997). Thus, Paul Stern, in the authoritative (U.S.) NRC contribution, Environ mentally Significant Consumption: Research Directions (1997), criticizes individ ual and household foci on consumption and defines it more broadly: "Consumption consists of human and human-induced transformations of materials and energy This is a definition of environmental consumption, as distinct from, for instance, economic consumption" (p. 20). He explicitly includes producers and dis tributors, public officials, and military organizations in the human-induced trans formations that figure in his definition. However, despite this broad definition, the rest of the NRC book makes no explicit reference to organizations as consumers, focusing instead on households and global consumerism. The essence of the argu ment that follows is that the purchase of products and services, by organizations, is a significant aspect of consumption in its own right. Organizations as Consumers At a trivial level, it is obvious that organizational purchasing shares many of the same features—not to mention items of purchase—that apply to traditionally con ceived consumers. Car companies need to buy not only car components and raw materials, and lubricants and energy to run the machines, but also pens, telephone</page><page sequence="5">210 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 services, and toilet rolls. A moment's reflection shows that most people spend most of their waking time in corporate or institutional environments or contexts; further more, the products we do buy have generally followed a complex web of paths from raw materials to finished products, with the elements changing ownership many times en route. In the world of economic exchange, buying and selling between organizations is the dominant category. The academic study of organizational purchasing has largely been done under the banner of industrial marketing; this has developed over the past 40 years into a significant academic industry in its own right and draws its intellectual origins from the explosion of interest in the study of consumer marketing that followed the Sec ond World War. It is fair to say that early attempts to develop theory were partially hampered by attempts to produce a general theory and rather underplayed the dif ferences between types of purchasing. Early work was dominated by a handful of academics and set the tone of further research by concentrating on essentially posi tivist models with techniques appropriated from quantitative psychology, focusing on the key influencing factors in the purchase decision process. However, both con sumer and industrial marketing were moving on from early models of passive pur chasers responding to stimuli (see Nicosia, 1966). For organizational purchasing, it was clear that decisions were spread amongst several interacting individuals within an organization—the so-called buying center (Millier, 1975; Sheth, 1973; Webster, 1965; Webster &amp; Wind, 1972). The 1969 book, The Theory of Buyer Behavior by Howard and Sheth, attempted to develop a universal theory to cover organizational and end-consumer purchasing, but this ended up reflecting a strong emphasis on consumer products. By 1977, Sheth was able to comment on the development of academic interest in industrial marketing and (rather curiously) asserted that the quantity of research in the field was comparable to if not greater than that for con sumer marketing. His analysis of work in the field at that point concentrated on the range of subdecisions present in the purchase decision (e.g., choice of supplier, choice of brand, etc.) and on the way in which the process of the procurement dif fered according to the type of purchase. Faris (1967) had introduced the idea of dis tinguishing between new buy, re-buy, and modified re-buy situations (see also Rob inson, Faris, &amp; Wind, 1967). During this period, progress in research in industrial marketing was marked by an increasing realism about the rationality of decision processes within organiza tions; a highly influential text was Cyert and March's (1963) The Behavioral The ory of the Firm, which sought to explore traditional perspectives of economic deci sion making by taking explicit account of, among other things, the presence of conflictual and satisfying behavior by organizational actors. This more realistic approach was taken further by the emergence of a group of European academics known collectively as the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Group, who developed the so-called interaction model (Ford, 1990; Hânkansson, 1982). This work took as its starting point the empirical observation that most commercial rela tionships were of some considerable longevity, which was a point that cast doubt on the importance placed by previous work on the atomistic decision. More significant was the relationship in which transactions occurred, the atmosphere of the exchange, and the economic, social, and cultural context. This work emerged at the same time as a growing interest from a number of other areas in management stud ies (notably, operations management and industrial organizational theory) that stressed the significance of the relationships between buyers and sellers and the potential advantages of trust and cooperation (e.g., Lamming, 1993; Macbeth &amp; Ferguson, 1994; Provan &amp; Gassenheimer, 1994; Sako, 1992).</page><page sequence="6">Green et al. / GREENING ORGANIZATIONS 211 There is, then, a considerable body of knowledge about organizational purchas ing. However, what does this tell us about the process of consumption in organiza tions, and how does it compare with what we know about consumer behavior as tra ditionally envisaged? To consider this, we will explore similarities and differences in the purchasing process under three connected headings; roughly, these corre spond to the questions who, how, and why. Who Is the Consumer? It is tempting to postulate that a key difference between the purchasing of an organization and the purchasing of a traditional end consumer will be the identity of the person doing the consuming; that is, in many organizations, purchasing or pro curement activities are typically carried out by centralized purchasing departments, whereas the atomistic end consumer acts as an individual. However, we should note that not all organizations have centralized purchasing departments. For example, the chemical distributor serving a city council that we have studied is accredited to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 but is only a seven-per son operation in which purchasing is one of many functions undertaken by the man aging director. In the city council itself, a team of only four provides purchasing ser vices, whereas routine purchasing is authorized and managed by departmental heads throughout the organization who call on purchasing expertise (from the pur chasing department) as they require it. Even within organizations, therefore, pur chasing may or may not be carried out by specialists. Indeed, in smaller organiza tions, it may look more like end-consumer purchasing. However, we need to be cautious of making too much of these differences. The idea of an end consumer buying for herself or himself may be challenged as being misleading. Miller's (1998) A Theory of Shopping elegantly describes how the pur chasing behavior of traditional consumers is in fact dominated by acts undertaken on behalf of others (e.g., a parent shops for food on behalf of a household). If this counts as consumption, then surely so does a purchasing agent buying on behalf of a user within an organization? One difference that does apply, however, is the charac ter of the purchaser: Organizational purchasing is now the domain of specialists operating in dedicated purchasing departments. This means that—in Western econ omies at least—a considerable amount of purchasing is controlled by a body of peo ple who have a professional commitment to a set of values, practices, and norms, sometimes being members of professional associations. For example, the United Kingdom (UK)-based Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) has a membership of approximately 5,000, administers a training program at various lev els, and sponsors and accredits courses in universities. There is a similar organiza tion based in the United States, the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM), which was founded in 1915, although its roots go back almost to the turn of the century (Farrell, 1954). Although falling short of the type of professional identity associated with, say, medical doctors or architects, the notion of consumption processes being mediated by specialists has implications for theorizing consumption and for understanding environmental impacts. The consumer—as traditionally constructed—is inevita bly portrayed as something of a dupe, subject to the wiles of the sinister advertiser and manufacturer. The very point of the purchasing professional is to break out of this stereotype; the organization of procurement means that there is at least some hope for some balance in terms of sophistication, cunning, and knowledge. Many of the rather sanguine analyses of the effectiveness of green consumerism point to the</page><page sequence="7">212 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 difficulty that consumers face in interpreting and digesting technical information or being able to make informed judgments of suppliers' claims. In organizational con sumption, there are a priori reasons to suspect that the prospects are somewhat better. Moreover, there is the likelihood that professional purchasers are potentially swayed by the norms and notions of good practice (e.g., see Dobler, Burt, &amp; Lee, 1990, pp. 721-741). Organizations' buyingmay be influenced by attempts to define environmental considerations as acceptable practice. Indeed, one initiative in the UK—Buying into the Environment, a CIPS-Business in the Environment (BIE) collaboration—has sought to do just that (CIPS &amp; BIE, 1993). Another point concerns the reification of organizations as economic and socio logical actors. In everyday talk, it is common to refer to organizations as entities making decisions, exhibiting behavior, and even having intentionality. In most countries' judicial systems, corporations have some kind of legal personality forthe purposes of contract and tort. Why not, then, extend the discussion of consumption to organizations directly? This raises a raft of complex theoretical challenges, such as just how questions of social justice are applied to organizations. How Is Consumption Accomplished? Even if the separation of purchase from user is conceded, it might be argued that it is still easy to differentiate the realms of organizational and traditional consumer by reference to the systematic nature of procurement in organizations. Within an organization, purchasing is carefully controlled by bureaucratic procedure (see Heinritz, Farrell, Giunipero, &amp; Kolchin, 1991), whereas for the traditional con sumer, there is no such constraint. The consequence would be, according to this argument, that one would expect a greater degree of rationality in organizational purchasing. Hollander (1986) discusses J. S. Mill's separation of economic ratio nality between consumer and business: "Mill observed that buyers at retail outlets do not typically make their purchases 'on business principles'—a reflection of their indolence, carelessness, satisfaction derived from paying high prices, ignorance, defective judgement and coercion, apart from high search costs" (p. 136). As orga nizational purchasing deals with the outflow of money from the organization, it is not surprising that it is generally accomplished in the context of some systematic procedure. Scheuing (1989) comments, "The procurement process itself is a prime example of a standard procedure" (p. 73). The environmental implications of a consumption process that is so heavily structured are paradoxical. This is seen in particular in the public sector, where the proceduralization of procurement is most evident. On one hand, the systematic nature of the processes of public procurement is amenable to the incorporation of environmental criteria; on the other hand, the systems are there principally to ensure financial rectitude and so sit uneasily with other criteria (see New, Green, &amp; Morton, 1998). Despite the paradox brought about by the structure of purchasing, however, there are several ways in which the organizational purchasing process can have an environmental impact, and these include but exceed the scope of action available to the traditionally defined consumer. In short, organizational procure ment may be constrained by the degree of structure, but it is compensated by its broader scope. To understand this, it is useful to consider how traditional consumers can affect organizations with the roles that organizations play in affecting other organizations. Two of the roles examined by Gabriel and Lang's (1995) The Unmanageable Con sumer are that of the rebel and the activist. In the former, consumers may instigate</page><page sequence="8">Green et al. / GREENING ORGANIZATIONS 213 boycotts of particular suppliers; in the latter, consumers may agitate and organize to redress the imbalance of power between consumers and big, powerful firms. Orga nizations are able to play both of these roles but may have other options that are not available for other types of consumers. First, there is greater scope to play a signifi cant role in the specification and design of the product and service on offer. Second, there may exist scope for making requirements of suppliers relating to the process and the product; an example would be using the adoption of environmental man agement systems (such as ISO 14000) as a prerequisite for approval to supply (Cascio, Woodside, &amp; Mitchell, 1996; Krut &amp; Gleckman, 1998). Third, there is sometimes scope for projects that entail the direct transfer of knowledge and tech nology between buyers and sellers (see Burnes &amp; Dale, 1998; Burnes &amp; New, 1996; Lloyd, Dale, &amp; Burnes, 1994). Although the processes of procurement may be markedly different between tra ditional consumers and organizations, not the least of which is in the time taken, it would be wrong to infer too great a variance in the degree of rationality applied to the process. One result from the industrial marketing literature that is difficult to dispute is that purchasing in organizations is open to all sorts of influences from the wily salesperson. The interactions implied in the notion of supply relationships bring with them even more complexity and take purchasing decisions beyond the realm of pure, idealized analysis. Davis (1994), for example, examines the wide range of reasons that are used by retail buyers when delisting products (i.e., when they stop taking a product from a particular supplier); due to the complexity of deal ing with the accounting problems, decisions ostensibly based on economic criteria are in fact often made without the information really needed to make a definitive judgment. Furthermore, research on organizational behavior has proceeded since the days of Cyert and March (1963) to reinforce an even more cynical view of the limitations of organizational rationality; Brunsson (1989) explores the way in which conflicting discourses are endemic in organizational life, generating a degree of hypocrisy in the way in which organizations conduct themselves. Why Are Things Consumed? A major element in the development of theories of consumption in sociological (and marketing) terms is the establishment of the notions of consuming not for the real value of the thing consumed but the meaning of the act of consumption (Belk, 1988; Bocock, 1993; Elliot, 1994,1997; Hogg &amp; Mitchell, 1996). This idea is not new, of course, and analysis of the phenomenon in terms of the current debate dates at least to Veblen ( 1899). What is new in the field is the refinement of models of the mechanisms of meaning and the impact of this process on the construction of iden tity and society. For Baudrillard, for example, consumption and the consumer soci ety are motifs of the age (see Poster, 1988). Narotzky (1997) also comments that, for some writers, consumers and consumption fill a role formerly taken by class and capitalism in the understanding of social relations. For traditional consumers, the meanings of consumption can be as banal as showing off wealth to one's neighbor or as simple as purchasing a particular brand of detergent to prove to oneself that one is an adequate parent (see Flynn &amp; Goldsmith, 1994). To develop the argument at this point, it is important to differentiate between two whys that may apply in this context. The first is the question "Why consume?" or "Why consume so much?" and the second is "Why consume this particular thing rather than that?" The idea of consumption as meaning generation or identity</page><page sequence="9">214 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 generation arises as an attempt to explain both the volume and detail of things consumed. When discussing traditional consumers, it is difficult to engage in this aspect of the debate without sinking into a discussion of real versus nonreal needs, a philo sophical point of some complexity. For organizational purchasing, however, surely this issue should not arise. Economically, why would an organization buy anything it does not need? Reflection shows, however, that there are ample cases of corporate excess: Why use color overhead slides for that internal presentation? Why have a fountain in the reception area? An entertaining portrait of lavish expenditure by organizations is found in Burrough and Helyar's (1990) ironic account of the strug gle for meaning in RJR Nabisco (which involved, for example, the purchase of pri vate jets for senior executives and the giving of generous parties); it is true that the market eventually effected discipline on such ostentation, but only after an extended period of consumption that was certainly directed to symbolic meaning rather than need, narrowly defined. Note that excess in one aspect of an organiza tion's activities need not mean that other aspects are organized in the same way; Wikstrom (1997) points out that individual consumers may also display extremely complex patterns of behavior (such as shopping in thrift shops and drinking cham pagne) so that austerity and excess are entwined. The scale of ostentation in consumption is not the only issue, however. In terms of the detail of things consumed—the choice between goods rather than the total volume consumed—the significance of particular consumption for particular meaning is also clearly visible in organizations. A mid-1998 UK advertising cam paign by IBM suggested to decision makers that they should buy that company's equipment because "When you give people better tools, you are telling them what kind of company they work for." This is a variant on an old IBM saying: "No one ever got sacked for buying IBM." However, both of these slogans are more about the feelings of the person doing the purchasing than about the product itself. This point applies to services and to products: Just as an individual's consumption of the arts and education can be seen as consumption for the acquisition of cultural capital (Bourdieu, 1984), an organization's purchase of training or consultancy services can be seen in a similar light. Organizational purchasing, then, can be easily squared with two more of Gabriel and Lang's (1995) roles for consumers: the com municator and the identity seeker. In our research, two of the organizations with whom we have worked provide interesting illustrations of this. One large firm wished to reevaluate its purchasing activities in the light of environmental consider ations, motivated very strongly by a concern for public relations and corporate image. Another firm—a retail buying group—saw environmental concerns as very important to its own identity as an organization. The reason for examining the envi ronmental credentials of products and suppliers fitted the group's culture and char acter, what it perceived itself to be, and what it aspired to be; this was the sort of organization that would concern itself with these issues. The implications of these ideas are significant but also complex. Organizations and their managers may have many reasons for considering green issues (Gallaroti, 1995), but if the idea of consumption for meaning is allowed, then the problem of connecting the semiotics of greening with some underlying reality becomes signifi cant. Serious difficulties arise for both activists and academics: The process of iden tity construction or the process of manipulative public relations may be driving forces for organizational green consumption but may also entail an element of greenwash (Greer &amp; Bruno, 1996). As with individual consumers, the meaning of</page><page sequence="10">Green et al. / GREENING ORGANIZATIONS 215 purchasing activities for organizations can be highly symbolic, faddish, and aimed at leaving favorable impressions with various significant publics. GREENING CONSUMING ORGANIZATIONS Chains of Supply The discussion above has identified some key issues that are relevant in concep tualizing organizational consumption. We now turn to the context in which such activity is set. We develop a series of ideas that center and expand on the notion of the supply chain. A supply chain is a metaphor for the linear sequence of intercon necting links between organizations (which, in market economies, will usually be firms; see Harland, 1996; New, 1994). It maps the way in which, for example, mate rials and components intended for a particular product or service flow from raw material firms and through component firms, assembly firms, retail firms, transport firms, service firms, and finally, disposal and recycling firms. In this sense, the sup ply chain is the organizational crystalization of real material flows that form the life cycle of the product from the cradle to the grave.2 Of course, a particular chain—for the production of automobiles, for example—is a complex network of organiza tions spread over a wide geographical and temporal space (cf. Orssatto &amp; Clegg, 1999). However, the flow of material is unidirectional—raw materials firms supply other firms further along the product's life cycle, which is why we use the chain rather than the network metaphor. Different types of products have differently structured supply chains; for exam ple, compare consumer durables (assembled by large companies for many end users with product design concerned with mechanical and electrical engineering) with construction (built by many small firms for fewer end users—property devel opers—with product design concerned with systems and civil engineering). The structure of the chains will be continually changing due to company takeovers, mergers, or bankruptcies and the increase or decrease in outsourcing. The structural relationship of organizations constitutes the supply chains, but the detail of this structure is fluid and extraordinarily complex; organizations may from time to time adjust the level of vertical integration, and the same organizations can operate in different ways in different product sectors. The structure of a particular supply chain is crucial in determining how the envi ronmental impacts of the various aspects of a life cycle can be reduced. Indeed, it is the decisions and strategies of the organizations in a flow that will determine the environmental impacts. For example, if a firm decides to accept recycled compo nents, the structure of the flow will change because of this decision. Flows are a result of the relations of organizations, conditioned by the obvious time-related aspects of that flow. That is, the components have to be made first, and raw materi als must be transformed into the components before assembly can take place. Therefore, a crucial component in understanding how a supply chain might change is the nature of relations between the organizations in it. This will be related—inter alia—to the size and power of the organizations in that flow. Which organizations are the most powerful and therefore most able to make changes in the chain depends on the historical accumulations of economic and/or political power. Of course, external events, be they government regulations, campaigning by envi ronmental pressure groups, or consumer demand, will constrain or redirect that power. In a report published by A. T. Kearney (1994), one of this article's authors</page><page sequence="11">216 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT/June 2000 has hypothesized a scheme of different kinds of power in addition to the traditional ones of monopoly, geographical proximity, and ownership: power by spread (i.e., diversifying your customer base), power by focus (i.e., including the product in an unrivalable service package and so increasing customer dependency), and power by initiative. This last one includes power by innovation, which is represented by a con tinual flow of innovative product and service elements to keep ahead of competitors. Innovation The importance of innovation, embodied in new products, processes, and sys tems, to long-term environmental improvement and especially to sustainability should be obvious (Green &amp; Miles, 1996; Howes, Skea, &amp; Whelan, 1997; Porter &amp; van den Linde, 1995a, 1995b). New technological developments on their own, however, will not be able to bring about the degree of environmental improvement some consider to be necessary—changes in social organization and in the mode of delivery of desired final household services will also be needed to bring about any "Factor Four"—never mind "Factor Twenty"—changes (Vergragt &amp; van der Wei, 1998; von Weizsäcker et al., 1997). New patterns of sustainable living inevitably require new methods of production, using, for example, less energy and new meth ods of the household delivery of services. Such changes are inconceivable without the availability of products designed on new principles and, in many cases, based on new technologies. Such new products and production methods are outcomes of innovation activities of organizations large and small. To understand how such product and process innovation can be better directed toward green objectives, we have to take account of the many studies of product and process design, development, and innovation that have been conducted over the past 25 years (see Freeman &amp; Soete, 1997; Tidd, Bessant, &amp; Pavitt, 1997). There is a considerable amount of empirical research (Christie &amp; Rolfe, 1995; Green, McMeekin, &amp; Irwin, 1994; Howes et al., 1997) showing that almost all innovative product or process developments in organizations that were undertaken for envi ronmental reasons were stimulated either by government regulations (actual or expected) or by what is labeled as market demand (currently experienced or immi nently expected). Government regulations directly affect the selection of projects that an organization will pursue. A prime example is the influence of the banning of ozone-harming chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on stimulating the innovation of chemical alternatives and, indeed, of completely new forms of refrigeration. The innovation-inducing regulatory signal may be received by an organization by a variety of routes. Some organizations, usually the largest ones in those industrial sectors, like chemicals, that have been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny, have research and development (R&amp;D) departments that maintain close links with their colleagues who are continuously monitoring external regulatory changes. Even if there are no direct regulatory constraints in operation, an organization might innovate because it anticipates demand from its customers for more environ mentally friendly products. Indeed, in several of the organizations we have studied, such strategic decisions to offer green products were made while expecting custom ers to become educated enough to purchase them. However, for many organiza tions, the key channel for the receipt of such signals will be its customers, who may demand changes in the environmental specification of the products they buy from their suppliers. The suppliers are therefore in this case often responding to a sec ond-hand regulation conveyed through changes in the market demand exhibited between customer and supplier.</page><page sequence="12">Green et al. / GREENING ORGANIZATIONS 217 From the 1960s onward, the literature on the determinants of innovation has detailed the influence of the market and other factors. The focus of economists studying technological development has tended to be on the relative importance of demand-pull and discovery-push as prime movers of innovation (Dodgson &amp; Roth well, 1994). To oversimplify, the current model is an elaboration of the view arrived at in the 1970s (resulting from much empirical investigation of how a wide range of innovations actually emerged) that innovation is a result, in varying degrees, of combinations of signals from demand and the development of new applicable knowledge produced in firms and in public-funded research institutes. Such a model draws attention to the fact that there cannot be one mix of demand and scien tific knowledge that explains the origins of all innovations. Research in the 1980s concentrated therefore on identifying the different mixes as revealed between dif ferent industrial sectors, between sizes of firms (the time-honored debate with regard to the highly innovative small firm and the monopolist large firm), between differing national contexts, and crucially, depending on the position that the innova tions occupy in the life cycle of a particular technological regime (Tidd et al., 1997). Studies of patterns of innovation have revealed the way in which different types of product and process innovation (e.g., radical vs. incremental, science intensive vs. redesign) arise in different industrial sectors at different times in the develop mental history of a technology (e.g., Nord &amp; Tucker, 1987). The science-based industries (electronics, chemicals) are the source of the more fundamental innova tions that are embedded—producing new technology inputs to all other sectors. Specialist suppliers (machinery, instruments) are another major source of embed ded technology (principally into other industries' processes or service-enabling systems). Other sectors, however, will have much less room for maneuvering in anything other than minor product or process innovation. Thus, some organizations in a particular supply chain will be much less able to respond to customer signals or requests on their own because the relevant technolo gies are not directly within their control. For example, a packaged-food manufac turing firm cannot easily respond to demand from retailers for package reduction but must pass such requests to the manufacturer of the packaging materials, who might in turn be limited by the raw materials currently available from chemical companies. So, rather than seeing the link between demand and innovation as a simple one between an organization, its market, and regulatory structures, we should see it as a series of links, with purchaser demands requiring a cascade of similar links up the supply chain. The ability of any particular organization in the chain to respond to those demands is dependent not only on its position in that chain (which is con nected to the power it has) but also on its possession (or not) of innovative techno logical knowledge. The fine structure of the chains—especially how organizations relate to each other in terms of their strategic importance in product and process innovation—is crucial to an understanding of how green innovation can take place. We need to focus on how organizations relate to each other as sellers and buyers (marketers and purchasers) and how this connects with their role as product and process innovators and (possibly) purveyors of R&amp;D. In addition to the supply chain metaphor providing the external frame of analy sis for the activities of organizations, the notion allows for more macro-sensitive consideration of what goes on within the organization. This brings the discussion back to the ideas of organizational versus individual consumption discussed earlier in the article and in particular to a detailed consideration of the nature of organiza tional action and the flow of information.</page><page sequence="13">218 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 Organizational Purchasing and Innovation: Consumption in Chains We now turn to the way in which concepts of the supply chain and innovation can be interrelated to shed light on the greening activities of consuming organiza tions. In this section, we discuss questions of agency within organizations and the transmission of market signals to suggest just how complicated green consumption by organizations can be. Earlier, we examined the questions "who?" "why?" and "how?" These transpire to be important points in understanding the organizations we have studied. Various sociological and demographic typologies have been suggested to describe the indi vidual green consumer: true blue greens, greenback greens, premium greens, no-cost ecologists, and so forth (Schwartz &amp; Miller, 1991; Simon, 1992; Wagner, 1997). Although this type of rhetoric is appealing in some ways, we argue that such convenient categorization would be inappropriate for corporations and other orga nizations due to the internal structures of agency. The first point to be made is that the places within many organizations that are able to either translate environmental concerns into procurement activity or absorb and react to concerns from upstream customers is rather ill defined. In one organiza tion we observed—a local authority in the UK—the buyers' main activity was to provide a catalogue of possible purchases to users, negotiating supply arrange ments and contractual terms with suppliers but leaving the task of selection and ordering to users. As the services of the purchasing department were sold to the user base, there was a considerable focus on meeting the wishes of the users. This was felt by purchasing managers to be a natural constraint on the extent to which pur chasing could introduce green products into the catalogue and—for the purchasing department—rendered too close an eye on the environmental credentials of suppli ers and on the details of their processes. For another organization we have observed, a major green cosmetics retailer and manufacturer, in contrast, the analysis of the green credentials of suppliers was a major business issue and warranted a separate departmental body from the main purchasing department. In another retailing orga nization, a committee charged with considering environmental and ethical issues struggled to develop sensible policies that could be applied among buyers steeped in a more traditional ethos of retail buying. In one health care product manufacturer, we found an intricate web of influencing bodies and parties to the purchasing pro cess. In a utilities services company, we found a senior procurement manager tak ing the lead, in collaboration with environmental managers, to ensure that green cri teria were used as a component of decision making. In a public sector organization, we found environmental specialists striving to have an impact on procurement deci sions but feeling constrained by the regulation of public procurement. In contrast, another public body felt no qualms with placing explicit pressure on suppliers to develop environmental policies and attempting to stimulate product and process innovations. These disparate ways in which organizations approach green purchasing lead to an interesting comparison with the idealized notion of the green consumer. The wide range of patterns of departmental and personal involvement and the widely varying effects (real and perceived) of purchasing procedures make a simple ascrip tion of an organization as a green buyer rather unconvincing. In terms of the impor tance of individuals, however, we do identify at least three potential roles that may be significant for the stimulation of innovation. The first of these is that of the green (procurement) champion: This is someone who for whatever reason (we discuss</page><page sequence="14">Green et al. / GREENING ORGANIZATIONS 219 motivation below) has an interest in introducing green issues into procurement in some way and has an organizational position from which such activity can be affected. Interestingly, we found that senior procurement managers, environmental managers, or senior general management could fill this role. The second and more modest role is that of green (procurement) campaigners: These are people who (again, for various reasons) have an interest in stimulating activity in the topic within an organization but may lack the organizational position and status to really effect change. More surprisingly, we found managers who fell into the category of green (procurement) careerists. This label is not meant in a derogatory sense but is appropriate to describe managers for whom launching initiatives in environmental purchasing is connected to other personal or organizational agendas; we encoun tered this phenomenon in a number of forms, and it seems that although this may in some cases be a highly effective basis for the greening of procurement in some con texts, it is not necessarily premised on the individuals concerned having a keen per sonal commitment to environmental issues. Just as the issue of agency illuminates the process of green purchasing, the con cept of the transmission of market signals is valuable for understanding what goes on when organizations pursue environmental issues. However, the exact mecha nisms inside organizations by which demand signals are received, understood by marketing and (where applicable) R&amp;D departments, and then translated into prac tical innovative product or process development have been relatively unexplored. Therefore, we need to consider how any environmental signals that are integral to what a firm buys stimulate its suppliers to innovate and how this takes place. Oversimplifying, we can assume that persistent requests from customers for some particular product features (e.g., that the product be in some way more envi ronmentally friendly) will be conveyed from an organization's sales department to its R&amp;D department by whatever interdepartmental liaison systems are in place. The R&amp;D department will then respond by amending its portfolio of projects to redesign existing products and processes or develop new ones. Within each organi zation, there are a variety of potential links between the sales department, R&amp;D, and its environmental management procedures. In addition, there are market links between its sales department and the purchasing department of its customers and between its own purchasing department and the sales departments of its suppliers. In this model, the only links that are certain are the market connections that link buying from suppliers with selling to customers. The other links are less certain as there is a huge variety of forms and combinations that they can take, if they are indeed present at all (many companies do not have neither R&amp;D departments nor, indeed, environmental management systems). The ability of an organization to respond to any demands or pressures from its customers for more environmentally friendly products will depend on three things. First, there is the matter of how attuned the sales department is to the demands that its customers make and how it makes sense of them in terms of the need to recon sider the product and/or the production process. Second, there is the question of how effective the mechanisms are that bring sales and marketing together with R&amp;D; this will depend on what particular organizational relationships have been established for the marketing-R&amp;D interchange, whether about environmental issues or other issues (price, quality, etc.). Third, there is the ability of any R&amp;D department to respond to requests to attend to environmental issues. As we have already mentioned, the examples we have examined have shown that the environmental signals that the organizations receive often come from customers or regulators. Even so, environmental signals from regulators are often the result of</page><page sequence="15">220 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / June 2000 legislation affecting customers as users; only a few large, proactive final-con sumer-oriented organizations are developing environmentally superior products as a matter of business strategy. Although the environmental performance of products is being improved in many companies, this takes place generally in situations in which the environmental performance of the product is a key factor for the con sumer. Ironically however, as Foster (1999) has shown, the focus on customer requirements is very often a limiting factor, restricting R&amp;D departments from proactively developing products with improved product environmental perfor mance. Organizations who see themselves as being driven by demand cannot build environmental objectives into their R&amp;D projects until they perceive them as cus tomer requirements. Such environmental demands, however, may only come up in supplier-customer dialogue when it is a key performance issue rather than as a mat ter of course. Conventional market relationships between seller and buyer do not of themselves routinely provide a clear channel for environmental signals from the customer to product innovation. However, there is a complex relationship between the signals being received passively and the signals being stimulated by the supplier. One organization we observed—a large, internationally active, telecommunication equipment firm—sought to tackle environment as an issue involving a range of people inside and outside itself, including customers, account managers, purchasers, and suppli ers. Players in environmentally well-regulated markets are very likely to have already tackled management systems (internal solutions to their environmental problems), life cycle assessment for product development, and supplier environ mental appraisal and assessment. Environmentalist specialists in such firms are now faced with the task of getting environment recognized as a key business issue. Environment, in their view, needs to be seen as strategically important to the busi ness. Therefore, they introduce environment to account managers (sales and mar keting) and customers at the same time; they want to have another set of connec tions with the customer—through environment—and want their customers to think of the firm as a reliable source of information on the environment and as a reliable, quality supplier. Firms can indeed stimulate signals from customers through focused discussion and education. For example, we observed that some health care product companies operating in the UK market will increasingly seek to place envi ronment on their (National Health Service) customers' agenda. In this case, it is rea sonable to say that with environmental as with other product and process features, innovation activity is a complex mixture of supplier-push and market-pull. The caveat is that both of these mechanisms need careful disaggregation and that the detail of organizations, processes, and products needs to be considered. CONCLUSION The role of the consumer (the end consumer—people who buy commodities from retailing organizations) in greening the economy has long been recognized by environmentalists. Since the late 1980s, environmentalist activist organizations have advocated the use of consumer pressure, for example, through boycotts of environmentally damaging products and through positive purchasing of green products, to influence what firms offer for sale and, indeed, to influence their poli cies toward the environment overall. End consumers' views and preferences on environmental performance (consumers as stakeholders) are increasingly part of the rhetoric of business organizations in their attempts to interpret sustainable development for their own ends.3</page><page sequence="16">Green et al. / GREENING ORGANIZATIONS 221 As we have argued in this article, it is our contention that the traditional image of the consumer is inadequate, both for theorizing in economics and sociology and especially for considering the environmental challenge of greening industry and the economy. We have set out the arguments for treating organizations as consumers and developed an approach for examining the differences and similarities between the two categories. Using the concept of supply chains, we have discussed how this frames the external context for organizations and is helpful in understanding the texture of behavior within organizations. Focusing on the ideas of agency and the transmis sion of market signals, we have indicated areas that point to a much richer and com plex story than the simple accounts of green supply might suggest. Certainly, more academic work needs to be conducted on these topics—a priority is developing a better theoretical understanding of how organizations operate in the context of changing environmental pressures from their suppliers and their customers. Having more empirical studies of the macro- and micro-processes involved in greening organizational consumption are of an equally high priority. With regard to any policy conclusions from our discussion, we have seen that the market mechanisms for the greening of organizations and of product innovation can be just as problematic as other mechanisms, whether these be tighter regulations or changes in management values. The greening of innovation requires attention to these internal company management and organizational issues as much as it does to the public policy issues over regulations. For both private and public sectors, we suggest that green supply practices need to be implemented. Without proper atten tion given to organizational consumption, initiatives from green organizations, indus tries, and the economy will have limited success. NOTES 1.
