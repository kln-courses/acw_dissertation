<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAN'S BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE E. L. BONE' S.J. Geological Institute, University of Louvain My purpose is to propose for your consideration some thoughts which arose in my mind after some years of palaeontological and anthropological work, especially in the continent of Africa and try to stress a few points about the Biological Significance of Man. This contribution does not pretend to be original or new. But I think that it is useful and profitable from time to time to sit back, to move away from single specialized research, and to look at the entire field of study which has been developed in anthropology and palaeontology for some one hundred years. By so doing one can get a general view of the problem and is ready to understand better how the many and various researches have contributed to a new approach to the whole study of man. In the field with which we are dealing, namely that of man's biological significance, I feel that our scientific approach has made in rapid succession two very important steps which are quite different, but complementary. The first major step is one that is hardly necessary to mention, viz. that modem science has proved and has demonstrated in many ways the very biological nature of man; man is one with nature, he is part of nature, he is an essential product of biological evolution, 'a genuine fact falling within the scope and requirements and methods of science' (Teilhard de Chardin). The second step is that man is unique, a biological phenomenon. Modern biology has judged and condemned the naive pretension of treating man as though he were 'nothing but an animal'. CONTINUITY AND DISCONTINUITY Not only physics but anthropology has had to accept this paradox as an essential and constitutive part of its structure. And I should like to develop this paradoxical aspect of the problem. The Continuity This is everywhere and overwhelmingly demon- strated today, 100 years after Darwin's Origin of Species. One remembers the scandalized reaction of the wife of the Canon of Worcester Cathedral when she was told about Darwin's theory of evolution- 'Descended from the apes? My dear, we hope it is not true! But if it is, let us pray that it may not become generally known!' I am afraid that it has indeed become generally known and accepted, even much more so than in Darwin's days.... Everybody who has made the effort to become familiar with facts and pertinent biological evidence has to agree that the organic world, man included, is a product of an evolutionary development. (I am talking about the fact, not about the details, and still less about the factors of evolution which are still-to some extent at least-questionable.) And people who disbelieve do so for all but scientific reasons: feelings, emotions, matters of taste, philosophical background, tradition, enticement off the beaten tracks ... but certainly not on scientifically based arguments! These people will always be present of course. just as will those who ask for the impossible and stupid type of evidence but cannot read and understand the one which is so wonderfully proposed to us. This is like the Mid- western gentleman who was still questioning whether the earth was round, even after he had made a 'round- the-world trip'! As I have just stated, evolution is more generally accepted today than it was in the time of Darwin. The intuition of Darwin indeed was that of a genius, but it was proposed at that time exclusively on the basis of comparative anatomy between extant groups of animals. Of course physiology, embryology and zoogeography supported Darwin's hypothesis very strongly but it was still lacking the confirmation of the palaeontological documents which would directly and explicitly show the phylogenetical sequence, and hence the kinship, between man and the animal kingdom. Now since 1859 and the publication of Origin of Species, we have discovered quite a few of the missing links between unspecialized primates and man. It all started just about the same time, with the discovery of the original Neanderthal Man and shortly after with all the allied specimens throughout Europe. In 1891, and much more frequently since 1927, the whole Pithecanthropus-group was discovered and interpreted, the last specimen recovered being probably that of Ternifine (Algeria, 1953-4) and Chellean Man of Olduvai, in 1961. It would be completely superfluous to recall here in South Africa the discoveries at Australopithecus level, from 1925 up till the present day, as well as their present extension in Tanganyika and in the Tchad region. All this very important material, accumulated in one hundred years and which amounts to thousands of specimens belonging to a few hundred individuals, provides now the evidence of man's continuity in nature. Of course there are still gaps and hiatuses in our sequences as well as missing links. We do not expect to find all the missing links, because we know today probably better than ever before that there is no single one but an infinite number of missing links to be found in the very gradual and continuous evolution of primates, under those selective processes among innumerable and accumulative mutations. Because of its method, palaeontology is and will remain unable to trace all the missing links. But at least we do hold today the evidence of man's biological evolution in Pleistocene times. No matter what can 51 S. Afr. Archaeol. Bull. 19 (75), pp. 51-56.</page><page sequence="2">be argued about details of the picture or about the responsible factors, facts, observations and docu- ments have been and are still being accumulated which compel us to acknowledge the validity of Darwin's intuition and evolutionary hypothesis, i.e. of man's continuity in nature. Actually, continuity reaches still farther. More recently the attention of palaeontologists and anthro- pologists has been called to this still more profound and more ancient layer of the past: these 20 or 30 or 40 million years of the Tertiary period, during which the family of man and his ancestors has got differen- tiated from the original common stock of primates, the unspecialized protocatarrhines. Of course we are now diving in such a profound and dark ocean of time, with still very poor and fragmentary records available, that it is impossible to sketch with any accuracy this very early history of our family; the hominid branch has probably diverged from that of apes in early Miocene times, before the brachiating habit developed fully and has been for many million years parallel to the other families of primates, pongidae, i.e. fossil apes and gibbons and cercopithecidae or fossil Old World monkeys. Although there is here still many more question marks and queries in our phylogenetic sequences, we are progressively becoming able to determine the biological continuity of man with primates even on this very profound level. It is certainly a great pity that we can no longer excavate in the Egyptian Fayoum, because the Oligocene horizons there seem to be rather rich. There, primitive catarrhines, Parapithecus, Moeripi- thecus and Propliopithecus were discovered (these being unfortunately known only from teeth and jaws). Oligocene continental formations have so far not been studied in East Africa, and we still need much more material before being able to trace the evolutionary path of hominids down to the bifurcating notch. But the continuity cannot be dismissed on that score. We know still more about this matter of continuity. It is still a controversial matter when and how the family of man has originated and become individua- lized from other primates in the early or the later Tertiary period. The available fossil primate material has allowed us to define three evolutionary trends which have played an important part in the prepara- tion of man, along this phylogenitic sequence of the hominids: expansion of cranial capacity, adoption of bipedal posture and upright gait, and very specialized revolutionary tendencies in dentition especially the canines and premolars. Now, as usually happens in palaeontology, we should not expect a synchronous and parallel develop- ment of these three hominid specializations. We have here nothing of a homogenous progression. Since the time of Dollo, and especially since Watson put for- ward his views, we have been prepared for this kind of mosaic or differential evolution. It is therefore not at all surprising to be told that the first specialization of hominids probably concerned the evolution of the teeth, which might eventually go back to the Miocene or even to the Oligocene period. Upright posture had probably developed some time during the early Pliocene while the great development of the brain occurred still later, after the adoption of bipedalism. Such an asynchronous mosaic evolution accounts for the fact that different fossil specimens may show very differently balanced features, as far as these evolu- tionary patterns are concerned. Of course these three features (brain capacity, dentition and upright posture and gait) are very special to man, and we shall have to consider them later on more closely, trying to understand how and why they make man such a 'peculiar' type of primate, and, in a sense, quite 'unique' as Harrison and Huxley say. There is no doubt that 1300 to 1500 c.c. cranial capacity of modern man cannot be compared with the 680 c.c. maximum volume of the largest gorilla ever shot (I think by the way that some higher figure has been recently recorded). It is true that no mammal either is capable of bipedal gait to an extent that, as one anatomist phrased it, 'it could go for a nine mile route march with boots on and a pack on its back'. And no one can argue about the typical bicuspid and definitely molarized first lower premolar of hominid primates; that is taken for granted. But on the other hand, it cannot be denied that these very same trends are to be traced in the other families, among non-human primates and even among monkeys. Upright posture and ability to stand on two hind legs is exhibited by them; they can run a short distance and stand up against the bars of their cages. Someone has even suggested that the tracks of the Abominable Snowman were made by a langur walking for a short distance! I suppose it is the same trend towards bipedalism, combined with brachiating features, which accounts for the very broad lumbar vertebrae of Oreopithecus for example, for its small and narrow pubic symphysis and for the shape of the head of its femur. As far as brain expansion is concerned, there is no doubt that a distinct proportional increase can already be shown in lemurs and tarsiers and much more so in catarrhine monkeys and primates; they show more complicated fissuration patterns that those of platy- rrhines and the chimpanzees have developed an indis- putable differentiation of their frontal lobes. In the same way, we should not be surprised to find more or less hominoid features in the dentition of Sivapithecus or Ramapithecus and the same could be applied, I suppose, to the recently discovered Kenyapithecus, from Fort Ternan Pliocene of Upper Miocene Beds near Kisumu, in the Kavirondo Gulf in Kenya. This again shows how much man is one with nature, and how close he is to his 'poor relations'. Continuity must be acknowledged here too. The same evolutionary trends are leading and directing bio- logical history towards its various expressions, and they surely originate in the unity of the one common 52</page><page sequence="3">stock from which they borrowed the fundamentally similar genetical potentialities. Because, if anything is certain, it is that man's evolution cannot be ade- quately understood except in terms of those causative factors and laws which are operating in the biological world outside mankind. It is beyond any doubt that anthropology, palaeon- tology and genetics have all contributed very substan- tially with ever increased accuracy and evidence to the information to prove the organic continuity of mankind with the entire living world. The Discontinuity And yet 'human evolution is, in major respects, singular and unique in the living world' (Dobzhansky, 1956). It has been indeed the great and valuable merit of anthropologists of the two last generations to focus attention on man's biological nature, to see and to study and to show man as a real product of organic evolution. But it seems to be the effort and the task of present-day scientists to rediscover-from a scientific point of view-and to emphasize the biological uniqueness of man. Just think for example of the titles of books recently published by eminent scientists: Huxley, The Uniqueness of Man; Harrison, Man, The Peculiar Animal; Teilhard de Chardin, The Phenomenon of Man; Dobzhansky, The Biological Basis of Human Freedom; Carrel, Man the Unknown. Dealing with man, Piveteau speaks of a new kingdom, a new kind of life, Dobzhansky sees in him 'the highest, most progressive and most successful product of evolution'. At a recent meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in Norwich, Sir Wilfrid LeGros Clark chose as the title for his address, 'The Humanity of Man'. It would be easy, very easy indeed but superficial as well I suppose, to accumulate titles and quotations; they at least warn us of a new trend in the study of man, and stessing a new approach of science towards the problem of man. This point will be studied in some detail. It should be said to begin with that physical anthropology and experimental psychology, for example, have for a long time developed this effort of defining the distinctions of man. I should like to quote here, as one example, the wonderful contribution of Schultz to this problem. With the help of a very impressive comparative material, containing large samples of nearly all the different genera and species of apes and monkeys, both from the New and from the Old World, he tried to find the place of man among primates, and the meaning and the extension as well as the so-called 'human distinctions' among characters common to all primates. Every feature has been studied; every measurement has been taken; means have been calculated and statistical analysis has been applied; ranges of variations have been com- pared and the significance of differences between means has been systematically tested. Now, after forty years of this very thorough research, if any conclusion can be drawn, it should be the following one, viz. that all the so-called distinctions of man are not at all special to man. They are of course human but only in so far as they show a major development of trends which actually can be found in all groups of primates. We have already mentioned the tendency for walking upright, with correlated lengthening of the hind extremities, and the tendency towards increased brain capacity which are both shared-although to a minor extent-by all groups of primates. But many other human distinctions have been demonstrated to be, potentially, the common good of all primates. Think of the modification of several portions of the vertebral columns, the cervical, the thoracic, the lumbar and the sacral portions all show definite trends towards increased or reduced number, and all primates have responded in the same way, although in different degrees. The vertebral column occupies a more central position in man, but the shifting towards the centre has already started among cercopitliecidae. The same can be said about the promontorium, i.e. the angle formed by the two axes of the lumbar and sacral columns. This angle is quite marked in man, from the very early stages of foetal growth. But if it is true that the process starts in a later stage of develop- ment among the non-human apes and monkeys, and never reaches the same very pronounced angulation, it is only fair to add that it is present and is only quantitatively different from that in man. It will be out of place to comment more abundantly on all these features nere, but there can be no doubt about it; all these tendencies are common to all primates. The so-called distinctions of man are only quantitative distinctions in so far as the trends reach an exceptional degree of development, because the process has started earlier in the embryonic life, because it has been continued for a longer time, or because it has developed at a higher tempo. It all seems to be a matter of degree. There would be no feature at all which is exclusive to man. Think of the lengthening of the lower limbs, of the prolongation of foetal or post-foetal growth, of the volumetric expansion of the brain. Everywhere you find other primates which share the same evolutionary tenden- cies; even the interrelationship between the several bones of the skull in the pterion area where the frontal, parietal, sphenoid and temporal bones meet. The so-called typical human pterion is usually described as the one which is found among the majority of people of the Europoid race. But a small minority of whites as well as a larger group of Africans, for example, have got the so-called typical chimpanzee pterion which does not mean anything as far as the physical distinction of man is concerned. And yet it is not possible to overlook the fact that, being a true primate among other primates, man is a very peculiar animal and an exceptional primate indeed. After all, it has been said, 'If he is an ape, he is the only ape that is debating what kind of ape he is' (G. W. Corner). It is difficult to deny that man is a quite unique and successful issue in the biological world. Physically speaking, he is in some way rather 53</page><page sequence="4">poorly equipped; he has not got speed, agility, and the amazing sensitivity of so many other mammals. His olfactory epithelium, for example, is of a relatively very small extent and, although he shares colour vision with higher bony fishes, turtles and lizards, it is not to be denied that most birds have got a higher discriminatory power than is possessed by human eyes. We have not got-or we have lost-the powerful canines and incisors, those natural weapons of most mammals and primates; we have not got any fangs or tusks, neither claws, nor fur; man's nakedness has even very often been proposed as one of the dis- tinguishing features of the species, although here again one can show that it is only a matter of smaller degree of hairiness in man, which gives us the impression of apparent absence of hair. Now in spite of all this, we see man spread today over the earth and becoming gradually master of the living and of the inorganic world. He has domesticated the large wild animals, herds of wild horses, buffaloes and elephants. He is protecting the big game, estab- lishing reserves and preventing its extinction. He is now assaulting viruses by means of all kinds of mycelia and provides rational reproduction of more improved cattle. He can get accustomed to all climates, to all altitudes, living in desert countries as well as in the polar regions. He is penetrating everywhere, even into space, and tomorrow I suppose the moon. It is quite a commonplace today to speak of man as the highest animal and the most successful product of evolution. I know that there are hypercritical people who think that this view is very anthropomorphic and that after all each animal species might argue about this. One has even asked how a fish would describe the world, if he, and not man, had studied evolution. Would not the highest form of animal then have to be a fish? No other than G. G. Simpson gave the answer to this critical scruple. 'I suspect', he wrote, 'that the fish reaction would be, instead, to marvel that there are men who question that man is the highest animal! It is not beside the point to add-that the fish that made such a judgement would have to be a man!' The most obvious fact about the singularity of human evolution lies in the fact that human species has evolved culture and that man is the only biological species that has done so. To appreciate fully the new approach of anthropology to the study of man, it is very important to stress the point that the highly developed capacity for symbolic thought, the use of language, and the complex body of tradition which we call culture which was made possible through it, is now coming into the consideration of modem science. It is certainly quite significant to hear physical anthropologists and unquestionable scientists, like Vallois, Heberer, Vandel, Dobzhansky or Washburn (just to name a few), telling us that the appearance of culture signified the beginning of a hitherto non- existent type of evolutionary development-culture being at the same time the result and a new factor of organic evolution. The development of culture indeed has become one of the most important evolutionary forces in the human species. Of course it was only made possible 'because of that unique biological endowment, the human genotype. Human evolution however is presently the outcome of interaction between biological and cultural factors' (Dobzhansky). To stick to biological factors which have made culture possible and which we can more easily trace because they have a more objective basis, it is impor- tant to gather all the factual evidence presently available to us. Catarrhine primates on their way to becoming hominids show the special and rather poorly developed type of dentition already men- tioned. On the other hand, protohominids or early australopithecines seem to occupy an open country, a kind of savannah or veld, certainly very different from the forests to which most modem and fossil apes or monkeys are practically bound. There is good reason to suppose that this situation is not a recent one at the time of presently recovered australo- pithecines but that it might have been going on since the Miocene period. Examination of fossil insects, fruits and seeds in East Africa suggests that such a countryside already existed in the Miocene of Kenya. But it is obvious that such a primate could not maintain himself in such an environment unless with some correlated adaptation of the body. It is of course impossible to decide whether this protohominid had left the forests and the trees willingly, under the impulse of some biological coadaptation of its limbs and axial skeleton or whether it was forced to enter the open ground because of some climatic change. After all, it is immaterial for our consideration. Science does not ask for cause and result, but only for facts which are linked together; we do not try to establish a causal relationship, but just a correlation between several factors. Life in the open ground for such a poorly equipped primate was not possible unless it could help to defend itself by means of some tools. On the other hand, the use of tools and a fortiori the making of tools require free extremities. But the earliest hominids we know, the African australopithecines, show precisely such features. Face, jaws and teeth have lost their predatory and manufacturing ability which is taken over by forelimbs and hands; these in turn have lost their locomotory function. These primates have indeed acquired the habit of upright bipedal gait. In other words, locomotion and prehensility are correla- tive, both are essential for survival for as soon as prehensility was no longer provided by the jaws, free extremities must have been present, or the group becomes extinct. (It is quite possible that Sivapithecus and Ramapithecus for example represent such types of unbalanced evolutionary primates, real dead-ends of evolution.) But free extremities themselves are not available unless the whole axial skeleton and the lower limbs and the entire body is adapted to the 54</page><page sequence="5">upright posture; foot, knee-joint, and musculature, hip bone, vertebral column and the balance of the head-everything has to correspond to the one biological unit. From the available evidence, I should think that it is quite possible and even probable that such a situation has been going on for millions of years. Locomotion was adapted to open scrub country, for the early hominids had already abandoned their forest dwelling. To replace protection and sustenance provided by the tree habitat, they must have developed a minimal manual prehensility, a certain use of tools. It has been said that use of tools is quite different from the fabri- cation of tools. But it should be pointed out that the occasional making of an odd tool for a causal purpose is still quite far away from a systematization of implements; the haphazard fashioning of a tool when there is a need for it does not prove the very developed ability required by the standardization of tools according to certain traditions. Of course we have little or no information about the hominid biological anatomical or cultural set-up before the early Pleisto- cene, but I personally would think that the stage of occasional tool-using or making might have been going on for millions of years. The dates recently proposed for the Kafuan and Olduvaian implements in Tanganyika associated with Zinianthropus and still older so far unnamed hominids - 1,300,000 years old -would suggest and support such views. Standardized tool-making traditions would not have been intro- duced until the third and most recently developed evolutionary trend above-mentioned (namely the brain expansion) had reached a sufficient degree of development, i.e. until the cortex had attained the complexity of organization required for conceptual thought, which would actually correspond with the dawn of culture. From this moment on, however, evolution both biological and cultural is developing at an exponential speed. Technical ability, supported by the brain expansion, certainly favours in a very special way the success of the hominid evolution. Brain expansion, erect posture, free jaws and lips: this very truly biological and very peculiar combina- tion of a threefold evolutionary trend makes it possible to develop articulatory language and speech. Here again all the three trends are essential and not the least the upright posture, because of the orienta- tion of the larynx, which is responsible for the con- trolled emission of the air stream and the conversion of a tone into true speech. Cortex, gait, face, teeth, speech, hand, tool; everything works together according to a strict biological requirement and according to most normal genetic laws. But this unique collaboration develops a very special evolution indeed. A threshold is reached and thought, culture, and tradition are the completely new products of this very classical organic development. A major discon- tinuity takes place in the true biological continuity. Three more points have shortly still to be stressed here, emphasizing the very peculiar and still com- pletely biological and organic character of man's evolution: Man's biological significance. Firstly, it is quite commonplace to speak about the lengthening of the growth periods, both prenatal and post-foetal, in man. Man is one of the longest-lived mammals. The newborn baby is very helpless. Puberty develops over several years and is not completed before 12 to 15 years. The adult stage is reached at about 18 to 23 years, i.e. after a rather long period; the immediate consequence of this situation is that the human child is dependent on his parents much longer, and that sexual maturity and reproductive activity will normally be delayed quite a few years after puberty. This exceptionally long period of childhood and adolescence would be completely useless and wasted among all other mammals and primates. Man, however, because of his mental ability and intellectual capabilities, will use it for a comple- mentary type of heredity, namely education, learning, tradition and culture. Secondly, a remarkable thing about mankind is that the anatomical differentiation which is going on as everywhere in evolution, under the combined influences of mutation, environment and genetic isolation, produces a 'fanning-out' of varieties and races but does not succeed in producing more than one human species; the diverging branches do not separate. 'Under conditions of distribution which in any other initial phylum would have led long ago to the break up into different species, the human vertical as it spreads out remains entire, like a gigantic leaf whose veins, however distinct, remain always joined in a common tissue. Zoologically speaking, mankind offers us the unique spectacle of a 'species' capable of achieving something in which all previous species had failed. It has succeeded, not only in becoming cosmopolitan, but in stretching a single organized membrane over the earth without breaking it (Teilhard de Chardin). It is difficult to over- appreciate the importance of this very exceptional evolutionary pattern and not to see in it a unique and still true biological achievement of mankind. Thirdly, Continuity and Discontinuity. A last point which deserves our attention and which has already been mentioned quite a few times, although in a different approach, is the classical and well-known great and anatomical peculiarity of man, i.e. his large brain, the evolution of which is closely associated with bipedalism and culture. But it is still more important I think, to stress how the spectacular expansion of man's brain concerns essentially the cortex or the mantle of the brain and most particu- larly the prefrontal portion of this cortex. We know that the special function of this neopallium among higher mammals and primates is to dominate the activities of all other parts of the brain. While the nucleus or basal part of the encephalon is concerned with the animal and vegetative internal mechanisms, e.g. metabolism, digestion, cardio-vascular, endocrine and reproductive functions, the neurological mechan- 55</page><page sequence="6">ism of instinct and so on, the cortex itself, i.e. the most typically human part of the human brain, is much more responsible for discriminative sensibility or the adaptation of the organism to its environment. It has a very special part in the control and the co-ordination of the whole organism as an individual. Estimates have been made of the numbers of neurones in the cortex of primates; man has probably got twice or three times as many neurones as a chimpan- zee. But this quantitative aspect of the cortical organization only shows the continuity between man and other primates, and eventually a kind of hierarchy in their development. The exponentially developed and increased power of co-ordination underlines a kind of new or qualitatively new organism, a true threshold in the history of primates-the discontinuity. It is still more interesting to remember that the prefrontal region of the brain, so typical of man, is not so much responsible for intelligence as such, as for social integration of people. Experiments of lobotomy, neurosurgery or clinical observations have shown that accidental destruction or resection of prefrontal fibres does not necessarily entail a notice- able decrease of intellectual sharpness but rather a loss of social integration. The patient, as we know, shows instability, irresponsibility, lack of co-ordina- tion and of foresight; he becomes careless, selfish, immoral-or rather amoral-ignores other people and can no longer collaborate. He is definitely less a man. That is to say that the very typical and most biological feature of man's evolution deals with that which is most human in man's freedom, responsibility and integration in a society of people. Man's biological significance. It has been said that evolutionary phenomena, being processes, can never be evaluated or even described solely or mainly in terms of their origin, they require consideration of their aim and direction. Man is one of these phenomena and it is our privilege as people of the twentieth century to understand man as a product of evolution, very much influenced and marked indeed by time and history, both organic and cultural. But if so, man can only be properly understood and defined by his direction and inherent possibilities. It is, I think, a great challenge that has been thrown out to anthropologists to try to bridge over the large gap which had existed in our approach to man by the very fact that the natural sciences were looking at the origin of the functioning of man as an anatomical and physiological entity, as if it were 'nothing but an animal', and that social sciences in their turn were studying man as a special being, as if he had never had any biological roots. This present generation of anthropologists and biologists may be responsible for having understood properly that it was the true meaning of evolution to produce man, and on the other hand that man's biological signifi- cance could not be fully appreciated unless by integrating the most human and most typical possibili- ties of man in this evolution, seeing them flowing and developing from his most classical and still unique biological requirements. 56</page></plain_text>
