<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Uses of Sensuous Immediacy in Paradise Lost By CHRISTOPHER GROSE IN RECENT American criticism of Paradise Lost we have heard much about the various "structures" of the poem: to name only two, its mythic and metaphoric structures.1 Until recently it has been unfashionable to speak of the poem as though "rhetoric" were anything more than peripheral to the epic's central concerns. My point of departure in this paper, however, is the critical vocabulary of the English Milton controversy, in which "rhetoric" is the poem's worst enemy.2 With this terminology we are familiar enough. T. S. Eliot, in On Poetry and Poets, built his famous indictment on the contrast between the audi- tory imagination, projected in what he called "rhetoric," and the visual and tactile imagination responsible for the language of Shakespeare and the metaphysical poets; in essence, he argued from qualities supposed to be implicit in Milton's blindness to the conclusion that Milton "wrote English like a dead language" (p. 141). While a poet should write in a style which gives us the impression of "being in a particular place at a particular time" (p. 140), Milton avoids the "real intricacies and by-paths of mental movement" by simplifying or merely elaborating. Indeed, Eliot charges, Milton's is an "active complication, a complication intro- duced into what was a previously simplified and abstract thought" (p. 142; my italics). It is primarily for this reason that Milton's verse lacks the crucial poetic quality: that sensuous immediacy which gives no illu- sion of a literary or "rhetorical" medium, and which reproduces the pro- cesses of a "sensibility" submerged in experience. *Originally read to the Southern California Renaissance Society, April 15, 1967. 1 Cf.

Ferry in her Milton's Epic Voice: The Narrator in Paradise Lost (Cambridge, Mass., 1963) and Stanley Fish in Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost (New York, '967).

It seems rather that the issues of the controversy have obscured some important intentions and actual effects in Paradise Lost. As Frank Kermode has said, Milton "was the main sufferer in the great experiment of projecting onto an historical scale a developed Romantic- Symbolist theory of the Image, [the historical effort of which] has been to identify a period happily ignorant of the war between Image and Dis- course, an undissociated age."3 What Eliot and his followers seem to have missed is that in part Paradise Lost is a poem about discourse, and even narrates as it were, the dissociation so interesting to modern readers- that large shift in the poem to an "alterd stile." Furthermore, we might say that the dissociation itself is staged, at least by implication, in the highly "rhetorical" action of the poem's language-particuilarly in those ambig- Uous crises, the similes, where poetry and the province of description appear in the recognizable garb of logic. In seeking to define the relation between "poetry" and "rhetoric" in Paradise Lost, we might well begin by considering the antipoetic or the overtly unpoetic elements in the poem, not as evidence for the unfortu- nate Puritan's psychic repression, but rather as a coherent abundance of details which imply Milton's interest in strategically framing his scenes and include much of his greatest poetry. As early as in the masque at Lud- low Castle, there are indications that Milton "builds in" attitudes toward the landscapes and figures of his own invention, like special glasses; and in "Lycidas," we are familiar with the way in which the poet embeds the germs of the final resolution within the darkest, most "naturalistic" pas- sages. In Paradise Lost, within an important simile at the end of Book I, the poet places a human, quite English "peasant," sympathetically view- ed-and himself viewing a scene; he "Sees/Or dreams he sees" the revels of some faery elves, which are likened to the apparently shrunken devils, anid Milton tells us that the peasant's heart rebounds "at once with joy and fear" (PL I.783ff).4 Outside the simile, as it were in the immediate narrative context where in critical accounts the image's congruity usually comes into question, the reader has just been subjected to a scene, also concretely visualized, in which the fallen angels shrink almost literally (we n-ever quite know) before the splendid edifice of Pandemonium. In- deed, as if to emphasize the moment, the narrator turns to us at this point with one of the many conventional epic formulae invested in Paradise Lost with such immediacy: "Behold a wonder!" (PL 1.777) 3 Frank Kermode, Romantic Image (London, 1957), p. 157. 4 All references are to the text of Merritt Y. Hughes, John Miltoni: Complete Poems and Major Prose (New York, 1957). 2 12</page><page sequence="5">SENSUOUS IMMEDIACY IN PARADISE LOST It is this essentially "argumentative" manner of framing Miltonic poet- ry that I propose to examine in this paper. And I will refer to Milton's peculiarly frontal mode of argument-his way of engaging immediately, as it were, both with the experience and reason of his reader-as his "rhe- toric." For Milton, this aspect of literary art was "logic," and by now it is safe to suppose that he did not view it with modern hostility. In his early treatise on the art of logic, published in 1 67 1, Milton notes that the argu- ment of similitude, perhaps like poetry itself, is less fit for proving than for making plain; its province is description rather than definition.5 And "similitude," discussed with literary illustrations, is viewed as integral to the science of Logos, and is thus a fit instrument in any attempt to "repair the ruins of our first parents."6 We need not invoke the handbook, however. At the very center of Para- dise Lost, God's commission to Raphael also involves the nature of per- ception, as the archangel explains in the metaphor of the "bright consum- mate flow'r" (PL V.469-49o). Given the task of warning the unfallen Adam, he chooses to do so (as he often reminds us) by likening "spiritual to corporal forms/As may express them best" (PL V.573-574)-that is, by a similitude. If we allow that Milton also prods the reader in such pas- sages-and thus gives them a "rhetorical" as well as dramatic dimension -we are likely to infer that language itself is inevitably associated with "corporal forms" since the Fall. Raphael's remarks, in fact, provide a tempting gloss on that provocative description of poetry as "more simple, sensuous, and passionate" than the other organic arts.7 What I am suggesting here is that Milton deliberately links "sensuous immediacy" with "rhetoric" (in the sense described above); the poem's most expanded trope, Books V and VI, in which the poem's audience (and poet) merge so strangely with that of the dramatic situation, is the focus of 5 I have dealt with the relation of the Art of Logic to Milton's own similes in "The Rhet- oric of Miltonic Simile," unpubl. diss. (Washington Univ., 1966), Ch. 2. For the distinction between definition and description, see The Works of John Milton, ed. F. A. Patterson et al. (New York, 1931-38), XI, 267. The distinction cited arises in the course of an argument from the obscurity of "causes" (an important word in the opening invocation of the poem) to the necessity of description in logic and poetry. There is a strong suggestion in Paradise Lost that "descriptive" circumlocution replaces a kind of primitive, magic "naming" or definition in the Garden. Logically speaking, the poem as a whole falls somewhere between the "artificial" argument of "description" (an attempt to embody the poem's "great argument" in what is essentially descriptive or metaphoric assertion) and the "inartificial" argument of divine or human testimony (Cf. Works, XI, 283). It is not entirely accurate to say that Milton brings divine testimony-the response of a prophet or the Holy Light itself-entirely into the sphere of what we call rhetoric; Milton would be the first to admit that the poem appeals strongly to both artificial and inartificial invention. The fallible poet more than once assumes the mask of the quasi-divine auctor. 6 Of Education, in Complete Prose Works of John Milton, ed. Don M. Wolfe et al. (New Haven, 1953- ), II, 366-367.

Such a connection is most evident in the poem's formal similes, and we must be careful in discussing its signifi- cance. For in Milton, as in Dante, when "poetry" is most concrete the poem's most important meanings may still elude us, and for rather spe- cific reasons.8 As Eliot himself admitted in 1947, visual and sensuous experience are challenged in Paradise Lost. " I do not think that we should attempt to see very clearly any scene that Milton depicts; it should be accepted as a shifting phantasmagory . .. [Milton, like Joyce in Finne- gan's Wake, makes] this peculiar demand for a readjustment of the read- er's mode of apprehension."9 I believe that the nature of this readjustment, too, is clearest in the similes of Paradise Lost. These formal images have always been admired, even by the anti-Miltonists, as touchstones of Miltonic poetry; but they can also be taken as epitomes of the rhetorical aspect of the poem. With their peculiarly ambiguous status in the scheme of Milton's Art of Logic -somewhere between description and definition-they are patently rhetorical crises in the poem's true progression. No lyric interludes or "digressions" from the poem's true progress, they rather remind us of the poem's true mode; of both the logical and imaginative presence of the poet himself, of the poet's dramatized mind participating in the difficul- ties, pretended or otherwise, of the poem's presentation. I referred to a mental presence both logical and imaginative. James Whaler has abundantly demonstrated the logical coherence of the similes, the rigorous correspondences between details of similes and their imme- diate contexts.10 What we are likely to miss in Whaler's account, however, is that it is precisely these highly "rhetorical" moments in Paradise Lost which are largely responsible for the old idea that Milton's best poetry is contained in the first two books, that region of darkness visible. Along with the character of Satan, the anti-Miltonists noted particularly the precise visual description of Books I and II; and if it is doubtful that mere objective "presentation" as a desirable end in poetry is something that Milton would have understood or agreed with, it is nonetheless true that many of the similes' thresholds do seem to answer these modern criteria. Satan floating on the lake, "in bulk as huge/As whom the Fables name of monstrous size"; angel forms lying "thick as autumnal leaves"; Satan view- 8 For an interesting discussion of the Commedia from this point of view, see Irma Brandeis, The Ladder of Vision (New York, 1957). 9 On Poetry and Poets, p. 157. 10 Cf.

In all of them the purpose could plau- sibly be described as the concrete imaging of particular appearances. As an example of the way Milton's "rhetoric" challenges our normal mode of apprehension, consider the simile, late in the poem, in which we discover with the poet a clarifying analogy for the moment when Satan "imbruted" leads Eve to the Tree of Knowledge: Hope elevates, and joy Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wand'ring fire, Compact of unctuous vapour, which the Night Condenses, and the cold invirons round, Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, Hovering and blazing with delusive light, Misleads th'amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way To Bogs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Pool, There swallow'd up and lost, from succor far. So glister'd the dire snake, and into fraud Led Eve, our credulous Mother, to the Tree Of prohibition, root of all our woe. (PL IX. 633-645) Thanks to Professor Whaler's work, most of us are sufficiently schooled in reading Milton's formal images to detect the rigorous pattern of corres- pondences here: Satan-or the glistering dire snake-is to Eve as the wan- dering fire is to the night-wanderer. We may be surprised to discover that this manner of reading (which Milton himself exercises in the Art of Log- ic) by no means exhausts the "argument" of the simile, even on this level. For, to be precise, the image begins by focusing on the relation between the hope and joy of Satan on the one hand and the physical appearance of the snake's elevated and "bright'n'd" crest on the other. In short, the ini- tial discovery made in the image is that the delusive wandering fire has the same relation to the night-wanderer that Satan's hope does to the wily adder; as if to clinch the point, Milton turns in on his own poem, as it were, by recalling the landscape of Satan's difficult "way" through chaos to this world: "O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare" (PL 11.948). Two suggestions may be offered at this point. The first seems obvious enough, though it has been neglected in imagistic or metaphoric readings of Paradise Lost: that just as the whole poem is in a sense necessary to "say ... what cause/Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State" (PL 1.27- 28), so the simile must be read as an evolving process of dramatized dis- 11 PL I.i96ff; I.302ff; I-573ff; I-590ff. 215</page><page sequence="8">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY covery. Milton clearly moves us in the image, from Satan's feelings to their effects on that shape in which he deceived man, and finally to the effects of that visible prospect on Eve. The second point is more pertinent to our inquiry. Read in this way, a given image in Paradise Lost is undeniably "argumentative"-"rhetor- ical" in almost any sense of the word. But if we do abandon modern habits in reading Milton's imagery, even to the extent of doing so in the manner of Milton's own analysis in the Art of Logic, we discover occasionally, at least, that "sensuous immediacy"-in this instance found in the visual appearance of the snake as well as the feelings of Satan at this point-is inivolved as an organic part of the rhetorical argument. That is, the logi- cal connections we have just noticed, which C. S. Lewis saw as a facade for the emotional connections "whereby he really manipulates our imag- ination," actually emerge from the seemingly unpatterned experience figured forth in the simile.12 Like Adam in the visions of Book XI-or like Miltonl himself in the letter to Diodati-we seek and find the pattern of argument, the "Idea," "throughout all the shapes and forms of things," here in the sensuous content of the image.13 The night-wanderer, like Eve, is a viewer of rather odd phenomena in a clearly fallen world. Milton drenches the description of what it is he sees with scientific language- "unctuous vapour," "condensed" and "kindl'd"-and does so in such a way that no reader, at least, could be amazed by the ignisfatuus until he discovers the sad strength of that delusive light and the credulity of the wanderer, warned alike by science and superstition. Needless to say, the discrepancy suggested by these casual details serves to make Eve more than the innocent victim she later pretends to be; just as in an earlier simile, a pilot was so imprudent as to fix his anchor in, of all things, a 'scaly rind." I have mentioned the temporal movement within anl image. A second example of this mode of argument in the similes of Paradise Lost is close- ly connected with the matter of sensuous immediacy in the poem. In the long comparison involving Vallombrosa, the floating carcasses and char- iot wheels of Pharaoh's army seem to provide an "incidental" likeness to the angel forms which is visually more appropriate than the original com- parison of the simile, to the leaves (PL I.300ff). But we should notice that Milton's language here refers at once to the psychological state of the angels and to the fact that (like Satan in the serpent) they are physically "straitened"; the angels do not merely lie "thick as"-Milton tells us that they lie "intranst/Thick as. . ." (11.301-302). The words framing the sim- ile, then, suggest that we have an image both about the appearances in Hell and the devils' state of mind: 12 A Pr-e.jace to Paradise Lost, p. 41 . 13 Cottmplete Prose, I. 326. 216</page><page sequence="9">SENSUOUS IMMEDIACY IN PARADISE LOST So thick bestrown Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, Under amazement of thir hideous change. (PL 1.311-313) Is Milton suggesting, in the mere imagistic sequence of visual likenesses, that the "hideous change" is continuing? A modern reader's problem with a passage like this stems from the fact that we are likely to think only of an "anthropomorphic" sense for the word "form." These, however, are spiritual "Angel forms"-recently "spirits of purest light," as we learn later in the poem, spirits now "gross by sinning grown" (PL VI.66i). One element in their "hideous change," then, is the metamorphosis from souls of pure light to visible "forms" or "figures"-an overall change in the direction of our own sense experience. The incidental progression of visual likeness (from vegetable to human forms), then, can perhaps be taken to suggest a gradual "corporealization" of the angel forms in Hell. The word "form," certainly, continues to be stressed from the Vallombrosa simile through the catalog. In the series of similes presented during the devils' flight to the shore, the fallen angels initially are compared to men (for the first time in the poem), and finally, after landing, are referred to as "Godlike shapes and forms"-a signifi- cantly different phrase from "angel forms," perhaps: less "technical," as it were, more modern. Later, Milton makes much of both the names and shapes of the "brutish form" worshipped early in human history (PL 1.481). The poet is concerned throughout the book to emphasize the brevity of the devils' stay in Hell and to accelerate their rising and quick passage to an earthly career in the "figures" of men.14 We cannot make more than a cursory examination of the catalog from this point of view; let me summarize those effects which are especially pertinent. Aside from foreshadowing the ultimate defeat of the devils in history, the catalog compresses time to dramatize the speed in the devils' evolution from "spirits of purest light" to their careers in human history, careers involving literal embodiment in the idols and institutions of ordi- nary "modern" experience; the climax of this embodiment, of course, is the almost magical production of Pandemonium. Involved in the pro- gression of the whole passage, I believe, is a double movement; first, on the narrative level upward in space and toward England and the "utmost Isles" geographically, and second, rhetorically, outward toward the Eng- lish reader and his particular "mode of apprehension." What I wish to sug- gest in the remainder of this paper is that Milton challenges that mode of 14 Milton's discussion of "form" and "figure," and of the difficulty of knowing "form," is relevant in this connection. Cf. Works, XI, 6i -63; for a reminder of this kind of difficulty, cf. p. 253. The observation is in Downame, Milton's prime source for the Art of Logic, but not in Ramus. 217</page><page sequence="10">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY apprehension first by drama of a particular kind and second by the strategy of undercutting his own poetry. We glimpse the first of these challenges in the conclusion to the catalog. Representing the reaction of Satan to the prospect of his chiefs, and for- mally a sequence of similes, the passage is also complexly visual. It is the first example of what we could call the "dramatic" use of simile in Pa- radise Lost; the deliberate use of a conventional rhetorical device to image the vision of Hell's monarch: He through the armed files Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse The whole Battalion views, thir order due, Thir visages and stature as of Gods ... And now his heart Distends with pride, and hard'ning in his strength Glories: for never since created man, Met such imbodied force as nam'd with these Could merit more than that small infantry Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were join'd That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side Mixt with auxiliar Gods; Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd Thir dread commander: he above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent Stood like a Tow'r; his form had not yet lost All her original brightness .... (PL 1.567-592) Here, as elsewhere, formal simile is inextricably involved with its context; and this section begins and ends not merely with a point of visual like- ness, as in the night-wanderer passage, but with acts of beholding in both space and time, first by Satan (or perhaps more accurately by Satan and the reader), then by the reader alone. Milton moves us in these lines from a conventional description of Satan's feelings to a recollection of epic bat- tles full of the best Miltonic irony. Like the poem's later attacks on fable and lesser fortitude, the medieval and Elizabethan material tends to be unshaped, as in the invectives of the prose pamphlets with which it has much in common. But I would suggest that Milton makes the attack archi- tecturally successful by framing it as the dramatized reaction of Satan to what he sees. The apparent anachronism of "for never since created man, /Met such imbodied force" follows and amplifies the striking shift to the 218</page><page sequence="11">SENSUOUS IMMEDIACY IN PARADISE LOST present tense and the almost physiological reference to Satan's distending heart. In the lines which follow, the speaker ironically displays extraor- dinary tolerance; he is willing to allow the heroic "on each side/Mixt with auxiliar Gods" and include "Baptiz'd or Infidel" (11. 578-579, italics mine; 1. 582). He intends to muster only pure power for the appropriate comparison; this seems to be the reaction of anyone, including the reader, who could admire the pure power of "imbodied force," and Milton re- minds us of its primarily narrative dimension only when we are told a few lines later that Satan "yet observ'd" the assembling army (1. 588). If we are to speak of Milton's "dramatic" technique, it is at points like this that we must be particularly careful. The "drama" in a line like "for never since created man .. .." or in "Adam the goodliest of men since born /His sons" (PL IV.323-324), as Frank Kermode has said, consists precisely in the apparent anachronism, in the way Satan seems to make his army contemporary with the armies of history and legend, in the way Milton here (as in the catalog) compresses most history into certain moments (some of them psychological moments) of his narrative.15 The anachro- nism involves the reader as well as Satan and.what Satan is seeing; Mil- ton's drama, in fact, seems to include his reader in what the devil sees. Largely through the similes and their evolving relationship with the narrative action, our own experience is literally involved with the pro- gress of the poem-such is the nature of Milton's literary strategy. If the line "Adam the goodliest of men since born/His sons," for example, seems inappropriate, we may note that, like the passage we have been discus- sing, it occurs in a context of Satan's dramatic super-vision, and can be seen as the dramatized perception of Satan, who is gleeful at being able to "confound the race/Of mankind in one root" (PL II.382-383). A final peculiarity in Milton's comparative rhetoric goes far, I believe, toward explaining both the heavy visual and sensuous content in the end- ing to Book I and Milton's poetic use of "sensuous immediacy" through- out Paradise Lost. Although similes throughout Book I (and the poem) appeal to immediate and often concrete visual experience as an argument -recurrent, "everyday" experience, even in the story of Leviathan on the Norway seas-they unobtrusively undercut epistemological certainty in that realm. The very analogies for certain cruxes in the narrative pro- gression must necessarily come from a world of fable, geographical con- jecture, and etymological uncertainty, of human names, nations, and inevitably (for Milton) human, "imagined" religions. Milton uses our experience and history as an "argument," then, but in mixing it with the realm of poetry and idolatry, especially in the catalog and its conclusion, he calls attention to the inevitably mythic and imaginative bases of that experience. He also suggests more specifically the quality of perception 15 Frank Kermode, "Adam Unparadised," The Living Milton (London, 1960), p. 113. 219</page><page sequence="12">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY in the fallen world. The ignorance and benightedness of human travelers, to which we may at times feel superior, then, may be intended as images of our own imaginative and spiritual perception. The many references to the error of myth and poetry in Paradise Lost-including that account of Mulciber's fall, so lovingly imitated-are not merely the Christian poet's intolerance with make-believe; they are meant to go with other sugges- tions in the poem about the dreamlike vision of the reader himself. It is with the limits of that vision, I believe, that Milton is chiefly con- cerned as he brings Book I to a close. In focusing on the moment when the devils first become recognizably human in the "subtle magic" of their artifice, he also populates the scene in a way suggesting both the great size of Pandemonium and the incredible numbers of the devils, who are again likened to "paynim chivalry." Then Milton literally reduces the size of the devils, at the same time calling attention to the illusory quality of the whole visual scene in Hell: the Signal giv'n, Behold a wonder! they but now who seem'd In bigness to surpass Earth's Giant Sons Now less than smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room Throng numberless, like that Pigmaean Race Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faery Elves, Whose midnight Revels, by a Forest side Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees, Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon Sits Arbitress, and nearer to the Earth Wheels her pale course; they on thir mirth and dance Intent, with jocund Music charm his ear; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. (PL 1.776-788) The passage epitomizes the techniques and mode of progression we have been examining and even seems to recall specifically many of the allu- sions of Book I.16 At the height of corruption, in the midst of the devils' material parody of God's created temple, Milton rhetorically breaks the narrative illusion in an interesting way, asking the reader directly to be- hold a kind of miracle or "wonder": the magical shrinking of the devils who just now seemed "In bigness to surpass Earth's Giant Sons." Once commanded to behold the wonder of the present scene, we are kept alert by the many repetitions of "sees" and "seems" in the passage. Milton first reminds us of his own catalog and the devils' power by likening the shrunk- en devils to "that small infantry" with which we are already familiar, and then evokes a midsummer night's dream, a quite English moonlit pastoral tableau complete with elves and a peasant viewing their "revels." Readers 16 Cf. PL I.198; PL 1.287; PL 1.575-576. 220</page><page sequence="13">SENSUOUS IMMEDIACY IN PARADISE LOST familiar with the A eneid often find in the passage a direct borrowing; but the viewer of this scene is no epic hero in the usual sense. Furthermore, only the reader has visually accompanied Milton, as it were, on his visit to the underworld. The presence of the elves and peasant in the simile may remind us of similar figures in Comus. If the aristocratic and ceremonial occasion of the masque prevented a fully effective use of an excessively democratic "rude swain," the figure is superb here, partly because he seems to corres- pond to the viewer of the wonder in Hell-in Milton's poetic Hell. The peasant thus represents the projection of a response at once to the figura- tive moonlit scene and the narrative miracle; he is the closest thing we get in Paradise Lost to Henry James'sficelle or "friend of the reader." The world of the peasant, or at least the world in which he "sees/Or dreams he sees," is (like the landscapes of previous and subsequent similes) illumi- nated by the moon. Here she sits "arbitress" overhead and wheels her pale course nearer the earth, as though she were in some strange new orbit. What Milton means to suggest about the vision of the belated peasant is defined somewhat more explicitly in the lines following. By repeating "seems" in the passage, Milton implies that in this moment of the most vivid particularization in fable and style, the quasi-comic status of the devils is equated with the realm of deceptive appearances-and perhaps with the province of poetry itself For in keeping with the double move- ment of the poem toward the great destructive gesture of the devils-and rhetorically toward this earth-he dismisses the importance of the devils' physical appearance, on which he has concentrated some of his finest poet- ry, and strikes the more ominous (if for some readers less "poetic") note of a reality "far within." The close of the first book is thus his absolute and penetrating answer to the question of what evil is at any moment really like: Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large, Though without number still amidst the Hall Of that infernal court. But far within And in thir own dimensions like themselves The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat A thousand Demi-Gods on golden seats, Frequent and full. After short silence then And summons read, the great consult began. (PL 1.789-798) This, in part, then, is the meaning of the book's ending: that while myth and visual appearance-the sensuous stuff of poetry-can best describe 221</page><page sequence="14">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY the "form" of the devils, their apprehension is ultimately beyond the pro- vince of poetry and "likeness" altogether, "in thir own dimensions like themselves." The worst mistake of the peasant (or the reader of Paradise Lost) would be to dismiss what he has just "seen" as being mere figments of imagination. Milton can express the full terror of the devils only by declaring overtly the failure of figurative language. By thus turning in or back on his own poem, as it were-now dissolving and now emphasi- zing the margins of his fiction-he keeps us keenly aware of the limits of poetry, as well as the fallibility of our own vision. There is no "outside" to this poem, he would seem to suggest; his Adam and Eve are real enough to address directly (PL IV.773-775) or artificial enough to become pag- eantry. Satan exists both within and without Paradise Lost, waiting "day and night" for man's destruction (PL 11.5o5). 222</page></plain_text>
