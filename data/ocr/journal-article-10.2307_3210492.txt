Redmount Once a mysterious presence in Egyptian history, the Hyksos (ca. 1663-1555 BCE) offer a fortunate case where a particular material culture can be associated with a specific peo- ple. Pottery unearthed at Tell el-DabCa and Tell el-Maskhuta provides complementary evidence for defining Hyksos material culture. While exhibiting a dominant Middle Bronze Age Canaanite heritage, these ceramics show that the Hyksos produced a culture that joined Canaanite and Egyptian traditions with the addition of locally developed traits. Ethnicity, Pottery, and the Gulf Olmec of Ancient Veracruz, Mexico Philip J. Arnold III The issues raised by pots and peoples, such as social variation and cultural change, are common to archaeologists on both sides of the Atlantic. These issues are especially well- illustrated by the Gulf Olmec, one of the earliest complex chiefdoms in Mesoamerica. Maize growers in the area of southern Veracruz and northern Tabasco, the Olmec (1200 BCE to 400 BCE) are renown for their megalithic sculpture. Analysis of their pottery traditions and set- tlement patterns leads to an intriguing hypothesis regarding one region of the Olmec "heartland" and how its inhabitants, the Tuxtlas, were caught up in a process of ethnic differentiation. Ceramics, Ethnicity, and the Question of Israel's Origins William G. Dever The archaeological population groups that we now know in the early Iron I highland villages of Canaan meet many of the tests for a distinct, new ethnic group. From cooking pots to storage jars, an analysis of the ceramic corpus of the Late Bronze IIB/Iron IA hori- zon offers sufficient justification for recognizing a distinct population group. Defined by other categories of material culture as well, this complex deserves the appellation "Proto- Israelite." Why Painted Pottery Disappeared at the End of the Second Millennium BCE H. J. Franken and Gloria London The pottery of Palestine at the close of the second millennium BCE is notoriously ugly. Yet the quality of the ceramic repertoire did rebound. Did the same Late Bronze Age potters who produced the heavy wares with cracked bases relearn their craft somehow? Did the innovations emerge from within or enter from outside the society? A study of how a vessel is made and its clays selected and treated is vital in any consideration of pots and peoples. Ceramic technology permits a move beneath the shape of the rim or the decora- tion of the surface. The Iron Age Fortresses at qEn Haseva Rudolph Cohen and Yigal Yisrael For three centuries or more, a series of fortresses at 'En Haseva dominated a crucial south- ern crossroads and offered protection to those who traveled in their shadow. The main periods of the fortress's life reflect the ebb and flow of the region's Iron Age history as control of the region shifted between the Judahites, Edomites, and Assyrians. In the final stratum of the Iron Age, 'En Haseva sheltered a small shrine from which excavators extracted assemblage of arresting clay and stone cult vessels.The restoration of these artifacts from what was probably an Edomite cultic installation adds further celebrity what was one of the most immense fortresses of biblical times. Arti-Facts Pillared buildings in Iron Age Moab and the scanning electron microscope. Caught in the Net John Younger On the Cover: Three anthropomorphic cult stands from cEn Haseva. Recalling the finds at the Edomite shrine of Horvat Qitmit, the sculptures probably depicted human figures and represented their donors in the divine presence.
