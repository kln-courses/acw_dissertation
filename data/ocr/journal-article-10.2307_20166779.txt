(1916, I, 231-364), Apollinaire presents a fictional account of that meeting: At the end of a cold, dark corridor, the poet Cronimental knocks on a strange door. When it opens, he sees the Bird of Benin, a painter dressed in workman's blue and barefoot, surrounded by paintings as a shepherd by his flock. And "there was in the sudden light the creation of two beings and their immediate marriage."3 In 1907, Apollinaire attributed to Matisse the statement?one that reflected the poet's own belief? that the artist is formed in his confrontation and struggle with other artistic personalities, with other scripts and other arts. All "plastic scripts" ? the Greek, the Cambodian, the African ? as well as arts related to painting, Apollinaire wrote, could help the painter discover his own personality.4 In Apollinaire's terms, Picasso's greatest encounter was perhaps with African art. Although relatively little was known in the early years of the century about the statues or the cultures Figure 1. Raoul Dufy, Orph?e, 1911.

Andr?</page><page sequence="2">144 RES 14 AUTUMN 1987 generation raised on the nineteenth-century myth of the "po?te-voy ant," Apollinaire regarded Picasso as something of a shaman or a seer.7 Picasso's art challenged Apollinaire, as African art challenged Picasso, because the poet considered it magic ? and because it was at once familiar and other. And although Apollinaire is perhaps best known as a defender of Cubism and the avant-garde, it was the paintings he saw when he first visited Picasso's atelier, the works of the Circus (early Rose) Period (1905), that intrigued him most and longest of all.8 Protean and liminal figures, Picasso's clowns would guide Apollinaire in a voyage through painting that led from Symbolism to the "primitivism" of Iberia and Africa, to the ghostly canvases of Hermetic Cubism and the harlequinade sleights of hand of Synthetic Cubism, and, beyond where Picasso himself wished to go, to abstraction and "pure painting." Meyer Schapiro has described Picasso's Young Acrobat on a Ball (1905) as an isolated and alienated "performer" concerned with the manipulation of form. The painting looks forward to Cubism, Schapiro notes, but also, more immediately, to Picasso's interest in non-Western art, in the art of "tribal" peoples scorned by European society except as entertainers and admired only by artists.9 The aestheticism and primitivism that color Apollinaire and Picasso's early work spring from a common nineteenth-century source: artists' perception of the failure of bourgeois society on the one hand, and, on the other, the failure of traditional Western myth to rescue the world from the vulgar and the banal. Myth is ubiquitous in the modern West, Mircea Eliade has written, but it is secularized, camouflaged, and in disrepair.10 Apollinaire's poetry is suffused with nostalgia for myth and legend and religion, but "many of those gods have died," he wrote in 1903. "Great Pan Love Jesus Christ / Are all quite dead and tomcats howl."11 One nineteenth-century response to this sense of spiritual crisis was an attempt to create secret and sacred spaces through art. Another was the idealization of a variety of so-called "primitive" sources that represented freedom from convention and an imagined return to innocence. In this vein, Rimbaud and Baudelaire identified the artist with the child; Gauguin left Europe for Tahiti; Champfleury wrote, "The idol cut on a tree-trunk by savages is nearer to Michelangelo's 'Moses' than most of the statues in the annual Salons. . . ."12 And Rimbaud claimed that he loved "absurd paintings . . . stage settings, clowns' backdrops, signboards, popular colored prints, old fashioned literature, church Latin, erotic books without proper spelling, novels of our grandmothers' time, fairy tales, little books for children, silly refrains, [naive] rhythms."13 Apollinaire's Alcools (1913), with its folktales and magic, its wandering children and gypsies and clowns, is heir to the diffuse primitivism of the nineteenth century. And, as Phoebe Pool has shown, Picasso's early work is related to the international "cult of Malraux attributes to Picasso a number of evocative statements regarding African art and especially its sacred and magic qualities in Picasso's Mask, trans., June Guicharnaud (New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston), pp. 10-13, et passim.

That primitivism, Pool suggests, may account for the many portraits of children in Picasso's Blue Period, as well as for his later interest in non-Western art.14 But when Apollinaire and Picasso met, between the Blue Period and the African-inspired works of 1907-1908, Picasso was painting another kind of "primitive" and outsider to "civilized" society: the clown. * * * It is the nature of Apollinaire's encounter with Picasso's early painting that interests me. Certainly, it is because they allude to the sad, moonlit clowns of the Romantic and Symbolist eras to which Apollinaire and Picasso were heir that the Rose Period works were accessible to Apollinaire.15 And the clown, multivalent and mysterious, creator and creation, embodiment and spirit, is a fertile image for poet and painter. The mere sharing of images and motifs, however, is not the most important feature of the relationship between literature and the plastic arts. Before Apollinaire, French poets of the mid- and late nineteenth century had already looked to other arts to explore the nondiscursive nature of their own work. As poets of the nineteenth century turned to the wordless arts, to mime, dance, music, and painting, to understand and challenge poetic language, so Apollinaire turned a poetic eye to an art of silence and stasis. In evoking Picasso's works in lyric rather than discursive terms, Apollinaire wrote poetic meditations remarkable for their subtlety and sensitivity to the painting. In dreaming of Picasso's art, he fashioned pieces of intrinsic poetic interest; and he deepened, and ultimately changed, his understanding of both painting and poetry. Apollinaire saw himself as an adventurer at the frontier of the ancient and the new. Picasso's circus figures too stand at a crossroads, between the Symbolist and the modern, the literary and the abstract, the figurative and the formal, the nineteenth century and the twentieth. To Robert Rosenblum, the Family of Saltimbanques (1905, fig. 2), with its wistful vestiges of symbol and sentiment, is "the last picture of the nineteenth century/'16 For Meyer Schapiro ? and for Rosenblum as well ? the Young Acrobat on a Ball (fig. 3) of the same year suggests a pre-Cubist artist "concerned with the adjustment of lines and masses."17 Apollinaire's interpretations of the Rose Period anticipate these views. In "Picasso, peintre," a lyric essay of 1905, he surrounded the familiar figures of the Rose Period with the atmosphere of magic and mystery that also washes over the works of Alcools (1913, III, 54-145), his first major collection of poetry. Nonetheless, Apollinaire was conscious of the radical promise of the Rose Period as early as 1905. By 1912 and 1913, when he was active in defending Cubism and other avant-garde painting, he was all the more aware of that potential. And in "Un Fant?me de nu?es" (III, 184-186), a poem of 1913, he contemplates the saltimbanques in the light of a new day. Placing the poem in "Ondes," the opening section of Calligrammes (1918, III, 157-289) ?his second and more experimental major volume of verse ? Apollinaire recalls the clowns to life, much as Picasso had in Family of Saltimbanques, to bid them a tentative adieu, and to proclaim his dedication to a new aesthetic.18 Apollinaire alluded to the Circus paintings in at least five poetic works published between 1905 and 1917. Of these, "Picasso, peintre" and "Un Fant?me de nu?es" deal most directly with the painting and are most interesting for the light they shed on Apollinaire's developing understanding of art.19 14.

Baudelaire's suggestion that the best review of a painting might be a poem is admirably illustrated by the lyric prose of "Picasso, peintre."20 The essay, written on the occasion of Picasso's exhibition at the Galeries Serrurier, incorporates an astonishingly detailed reading of the painting, not only of its general atmosphere and ?mages, but also of its specific works and subtle evolutions. In so doing, it stands in complex relation to the painting, as a good illustration does to a text.21 Admittedly the reverie of a poet, "Picasso, peintre" has the virtue of engaging and extending the canvas without reducing it to a set of fixed meanings or robbing it of suggestion ? of what the nineteenth-century poets called music, and Gauguin and other nineteenth century painters called poetry.22 According to Daix and Boudaille, "Picasso liked Apollinaire's essay . . . very much.

Born of the profound knowledge that humanity had of itself, the adored pantheisms that resembled it have gone to sleep. But despite eternal slumbers, there are eyes that reflect humanities resembling divine and joyous phantoms. "Picasso, peintre" is not only a meditation on the paintings of the Blue and Rose periods; it is also an inquiry into the nature of art. "Picasso has looked at human ?mages that float in the azure of our memories and that partake of the divine. . . ." Apollinaire does not isolate or comment directly on the blue monochrome of 1901 to 1904 (the Blue Period).24 Through the poetic ?mage, he suggests that its works were born not of optics but of mind, that although Picasso depicted the poor and outcast of Paris and Barcelona with compassion, his gaze, like those of his blind men and oddly staring youths, looks not into physical but into spiritual space. This painting, he implies, is the product of memory and thus shares a common inspiration with poetry. Art, Picasso believed during the Blue Period, was born of love and suffering, of innocence and introspection.25 "These children whom no one caresses understand so much. Mommy, love me a lot. They know how to jump and the feats they accomplish are [like] mental evolutions."26 Apollinaire treats the children as a group, as he will other Blue Period figures (fig. 4). Using the children as a point of departure, he creates a fiction that is also a comment on the Blue Period. There are echoes here of the Romantic notion that art comes of suffering. The children of "Picasso, peintre" are Figure 3. Picasso, young Acrobat on a Bail, 1905. Pushkin Museum, Moscow. ?

Art, Apollinaire implies in the first lines of the essay, is the fruit of knowledge and insight. In his own work, he associates art with magic and esotericism. Picasso's children also understand, the essay notes, but their knowledge and power are more primitive and instinctive. They stop and the rain ceases to fall; nature bows before them as it did for Baudelaire's "Boh?miens en voyage,"27 as it will for Apollinaire's "Saltimbanques" (Alcools, III, 97). 23.

According to Sabart?s, Picasso preferred "childlike stammerings" to "academic rhetoric" in the Blue Period years and admired "primitive" art for its innocence. And "if we demand sincerity of the artist," Sabart?s goes on, "we must remember that it is not to be found outside the realm of grief."29 Condemned to sadness and solitude, Picasso's figures, as Apollinaire portrays them, turn inward. And in the essay, the privileged among them, like the painter or the mystic, reveal truths that cannot be explained, but can be manifested in form.30 The poor children of Apollinaire's imagination trace with their bodies the invisible and impalpable shapes of thought. Idea and emotion are embodied in symbol. And, like Mallarm?'s ballerina, and the painter, the acrobat creates a poem without using the writer's tools.31 "After all," Picasso is reported to have said, "the arts are all the same; you can write a picture in words just as you can paint sensations in a poem."32 During the Blue Period, Picasso was influenced by the Symbolist dialogue among the arts, and by Symbolist painters who, with Gauguin, believed that suggestion was all important in art and that the artistic sign was a manifestation of the idea.33 Apollinaire's simile, the comparison of movement and thought, takes note of this aesthetic and marks its limitations. According to Pierre Daix, the dilemma of the Blue Period is the risk of an overly abstract symbolism on the one hand and an excessively anecdotal realism on the other.34 In Apollinaire's image, there is a tension between symbol and idea and a persistence of anecdote that reflects this dilemma. The Blue Period, as Apollinaire portrays it, is a realm of interiority, and Picasso's figures are presented, not only as personal symbols and as reflections of phantom images that float in a collective cultural memory, but also as fictional characters who possess thoughts and feelings and have a past. As he begins to comment on the Rose Period (fig. 5),35 however, Apollinaire speculates less often on the social status of the figures or the states of mind behind the masks. The apparent autonomy of the figure becomes more precarious, the essay implies, the autonomy of the canvas more evident, and meaning comes to reside not only in the fiction, but also in the artistry that produced it. A work of art, Apollinaire would write in 1908, is an "enchanting falsehood," a human fabrication with its own laws distinct from nature's (III, 783; AoA, 49). While there are many possible explanations for Picasso's interest in the clown in 1904 and 1905, it is interesting to note that clowns and acrobats belong to a theatrical tradition that celebrates artifice. In the portion of the essay devoted to the Rose Period, Apollinaire views the clowns from outside, without penetrating their thoughts. Occasionally, he seems to think of the painter as a director who shapes and places the figures to achieve a desired effect. Whereas Apollinaire began his study of the Blue Period by reflecting on the consciousness of artist and figures, he directs his first remarks on the Rose Period to the formal elements of the painting. The essay thus appears to suggest that dramatic and expressive function has been transferred from the figure to the line and colors that produce it, that emotion here is manifested not in character but in form: "The harlequins live beneath their ragged finery while the painting gathers, heats up, or whitens its colors in order to tell of the strength and the duration of passions, while the lines . . . curve, soar ... or are cut short." There are echoes here of the nineteenth-century notion, variously expressed by Delacroix, Baudelaire, Gauguin, Denis, and others ? that line and color act on 28. It may be that the Old Guitarist was not among the paintings at the Galeries Serrurier. Positive identification of the paintings exhibited is not possible. See Daix and Boudaille, pp. 254-255. 29. Sabart?s, p. 65. Sabart?s speaks generally of "primitive painters" without mentioning any specific artist or work. 30. Unlike the mystic's truth, the painter's posits no independent existence, but is revealed only in the act of creation. "A painting," Picasso said, "is not thought out and fixed beforehand; while one is painting it, it follows the mobility of one's thoughts."

And in the rest of the essay, the poet emphasizes?more than many of the professional critics do, and more than he himself later would ? the symbolic and mythic dimensions of the Rose Period. Like the demiurges of Alcools and the clowns of nineteenth-century art, Apollinaire's saltimbanque is a privileged figure of the artist and a creature of artists' shared imagination. In "Picasso, peintre," the Rose Period is depicted as a timeless realm, not of fictional consciousness, but of mythic correspondence: "Color has the flat quality of frescoes, and the lines are firm. But placed at the outer limits of life, the animals are human and the sexes indistinct." Isolated in an obscure and deserted landscape, clothed in maillots even when they do not perform, the saltimbanques are primitive and magic figures. The clowns of the essay, all at a twilight time of life, know neither past nor future. The females, nubile, fertile, are close to the source of life. The acrobats whom they resemble are morbidly aged and withered, perhaps because they know more shadowy mysteries. Young girls have been instructed in religion by animals, and the line between human and bestial cannot be drawn: "Hybrid beasts have the consciousness of the demigods of Egypt." Although they pose in the manner of the Holy Family, the saltimbanques remind Apollinaire of the figures of Greek vase painting. And like the Greeks of Hermetic tradition, the clowns he describes are initiates. The clowns of the painting and essay do not gaze at their mates but stare into space, cast their eyes down, or perform feats of balance that are solitary rites. As Starobinski points out, the acrobat of nineteenth-century art was also a narcissistic figure; and "beauty that suffices to itself," he says, "is an androgyne."37 Like the children who represented the Blue Period, the clowns of "Picasso, peintre" figure their own creation. Conceived in mystery, they are born Figure 4. Picasso, Three Ghildren (Petits Gueux), 1904. Location unknown, Zervos, I, 219. ? SPADEM, Paris/VAGA, New York, 1987. miraculously and unexpectedly. Once grown, they in turn create lovely and silent forms. "The adolescent sisters, treading and balancing themselves on the great balls of the saltimbanques, impart to those spheres the radiant movement of the planets." Picasso's Young Acrobat on a Ball, which Apollinaire almost certainly has in mind here, can be seen in retrospect as a figure of the pre-Cubist artist. In "Picasso, peintre," however, line and mass are not mere form: the shapes they assume are celestial. The saltimbanques' mastery borders on magic, and the globes they tread move in harmony with the universe. Apollinaire abandons the simile that linked idea and sign in his image of the Blue Period children. In the Rose Period, the poet implies, the symbol no longer stands for the reality. It is the 36.

And the traditional figures of the Rose Period, repositories of dream, are, at the same time, perhaps no more than they reveal. "There is a genuine mystery in art," Northrop Frye notes, "and a real place for wonder. . . . But the intrinsic mystery . . . remains a mystery in itself no matter how fully known it is, and hence is not a mystery separated from what is known."38 "Painting remains painting because it eludes . . . investigation," Picasso once commented. "It remains there like a question. And it alone gives the answer."39 In another poem inspired by the Rose Period, Rilke asks, "But tell me, who are they these acrobats, even a little more fleeting than we ourselves. . . ."40 The painting seems to invite the question and mock the asker. Of all the descendants of Watteau's Gilles and Deburau's Pierrot, Picasso's are perhaps the most unfathomable. Some have interpreted the figures' detachment and alienation in psychological or sociological terms; many have attributed their lack of clear relation to one another to the Rose Period's increasing rejection of anecdote and allegory.41 When Cubism reduces Harlequin to the lozenge shapes of his costume,42 there is relatively little temptation to interpret the canvas in sentimental terms. In the Rose Period, however, the integrity of the figure is respected and enhanced by symbolic and autobiographical allusion.43 As a result, the lack of clear connection among the figures is puzzling and tends to be read as mystery. The atmosphere of religious mystery in the essay may have been suggested in part by the painting's allusions to Christian art. Apollinaire was also aware, of course ? as was Picasso, according to Reff?of the "primitive" and "demonic" origins of the clown.44 Apollinaire's sense of the quasi-sacred nature of the Rose Period, moreover, seems justified in light of Picasso's later fascination with the supernatural qualities of African sculpture and with the near sacred status of all art.45 Ultimately, however, the mysticism of "Picasso, peintre" is related to ideas and images that haunted Apollinaire before and after his encounter with Picasso. Apollinaire makes no explicit reference to any cult in "Picasso, peintre." To do so baldly would betray an art that chooses silence over speech, painting over literature. Nonetheless, throughout the essay, he uses themes and motifs associated elsewhere in his work with Hermeticism. Describing the evolution of the painting, he thus traces an initiate's voyage, from descent into a blue abyss, to death and resurrection, to 38.

Apollinaire was drawn to the Hermetic writings, where initiation is described as knowledge and awakening, where introspection yields truths that transcend individual consciousness. He was not, however, a mystic, nor did he hesitate to distort Hermetic doctrine in the service of asserting the primacy of human creation over the divine.46 Rather, he used the language of mysticism, as nineteenth-century poets had, to express his ideas about art. The Symbolists, according to A. G. Lehmann, confused imaginative knowledge with the irrational and thus associated art with the occult.47 Such confusion is common, Suzanne Langer states. Artistic truth, she says, is not mystical, but it is inaccessible to discursive reason, untranslatable, and "bound to the particular forjm which it has taken."48 According to Eliade, literature and spectacle play a role in modern society akin to that of myth in traditional societies, in that they transcend historical time to recover a sense of the paradisiacal and the primordial through the recreation of language.49 The remark is interesting in light of the Symbolist concern with languages that go beyond the discursive and beyond language itself. Like his Symbolist predecessors, Apollinaire uses a quasi religious vocabulary to express his awe of an art that articulates the ineffable and that does so without words. "The spectator who watches them must be pious," he writes of the clowns, "for they celebrate wordless rites with painstaking agility." By 1913, when Apollinaire published "Un Fant?me de nu?es," a poem that reconsiders both the Rose Period and his own aesthetic, contemporary painting had undergone great changes. "One cannot forever carry on one's back the body of one's father," Apollinaire had written in 1908 (AoA, 48). As early as 1905, Picasso had begun to abandon the sentimental vocabulary of Symbolism. In 1906, he turned to archaic Greek and Iberian sculpture for inspiration, and, in 1907, to African and Oceanic art.50 According to Andr? Malraux, Picasso believed the African pieces were "magic things," "intercessors." "The fetishes," Picasso reportedly said, "were weapons."51 African art had its role in Picasso's "proto-Cubist" painting of 1907-1908, as it would in Synthetic Cubism's (1912-1921) use of disparate materials and multiple sign systems.52 As Picasso himself would later state, however, the African sculptures were not so much "models" as "witnesses"53 to his own metamorphoses. In 1907, he completed the powerful and disturbing Demoiselles d'Avignon, which he described as his first "exorcism-painting."54 By the end of that year, Apollinaire had introduced Picasso to Braque. Cubism was born and, in its wake, Delaunay's Simultanism, or Orphism, as Apollinaire baptized it. The fin de si?cle atmosphere that lingered in the opening years of the century had faded. Born of Symbolism, the new art surpassed and destroyed that aesthetic, and there was in the air a feeling of freedom from tradition, from imitation, from all order save that created out of chaos by the artist (AoA, 38). This freedom, as romanticized by Apollinaire and other participants and observers, was accompanied by a sense of the primitive and exotic manifest in the vitality of new forms, the vibrance of new colors. Matisse, Apollinaire noted, created a luminous and hedonistic art of bold colors freed not only from verisimilitude, but also from the symbolism and mysticism of his predecessors (AoA, 330-331). Once the Rose Period had ended, Picasso dealt a further blow to realism with the depiction of hulking figures stalking through forests of jagged shapes. And Rousseau, Apollinaire wrote, painted lush paradises of a reality so overwhelming to their creator that he was forced to open the window to breathe (AoA, 349). In the years that preceded the war, Paris no longer seemed so gray and muddy to its artist/chroniclers as it had to Baudelaire's exiles, nor paradise so far.55 The spirits of 46.

And no less exuberant spirits were to be found in indigenous marvels, in the fantasies of folk art and the equally fantastic creatures of technology: airplanes and dirigibles, towers and wheels. Even the shards of caf? interiors, bits of newsprint, scraps of oilcloth, bottle labels, took on new wonder in Cubist painting. With Sonia Delaunay's invention of Simultaneous books and dresses, "astral" cushions, and "halo depth" lamps (AoA, 337), once-ordinary objects became receptacles of light and color. The same color rhythms were present in the painting of Robert Delaunay, in rainbows and prisms both abstract and astral. Delaunay claimed to have rediscovered "the childhood of all art,"56 and Apollinaire's choice of the word Orphism to describe Delaunay's painting is felicitous, says Jean Cassou, for it evokes an age even before the most primitive, when the first god is the poet who "awakens to things, names them, and sings their praises."57 There was, in the myth of the new that Apollinaire helped create, a mood of utopia very different from the dream worlds of Symbolism. Unlike Mallarm?'s clown, martyr to the artificial, the painters of Apollinaire's circle could announce without shame, "J'ai trou? dans le mur de toile une fen?tre."58 More precisely, they looked through a Paris windowpane onto a world that, neither mythological nor mundane, was a kaleidoscope of the seen and the imagined. There is a popular element in much of this art, in Cubists' depiction of caf? interiors, in Delaunay's representation of urban motifs?ballplayers and Ferris wheels ? borrowed from picture postcards and photographs.59 And it is only seemingly paradoxical that painters open to the world around them created an art radically lacking in what is popularly termed "realism." Artists now felt free to open their eyes because the real world was suffused with imagination and because, once they had abandoned illusionism, they no longer feared being mere imitators or transcribers. When Cubism broke definitively with perspective and shattered the traditional categories of figure and ground, the canvas itself began to assume the status of an object in the world rather than a mirror held up to it.60 Painting had all but dispensed with fiction. If spectators could wonder naively at the thoughts and feelings of Picasso's blue figures, they would not think to muse on the past lives of the Demoiselles d'Avignon. As fiction dissolved into form, the meaning of art began to reside not in mystery but in presence. Painting, Apollinaire believed, had begun to approach music in its liberation from the perceived tyranny of the subject (AoA, 197). And it is again only seemingly paradoxical that poets, including Apollinaire, found inspiration in an art increasingly disdainful of the impure, that is, of the literary. So too Apollinaire's art had evolved, in part as a result of its confrontation with painting. The influence of the plastic arts on his work is most evident in "Ondes," the first section of Calligrammes (1918). In Alcools (1913), only "Zone" (III, 55-60) ?the first poem in the volume, although the last to be composed ? invites comparison with avant-garde painting. "Zone's" celebration of the naive faith of childhood, of Christ the aviator, and of the childish grace of a young industrial street suggests something of the primitivism of the time. So too do billboards screeching like jungle parrots. The poem's ironic proclamation of the poetry of signboards and handbills and the prose of newspapers may allude to Cubist iconography. And the Eiffel Tower?a shepherdess of bleating bridges in the poem ? was a favorite image of Rousseau and Robert Delaunay. But "Zone" is above all a regretful and tentative farewell to the poet's youth and to the dusky and autumnal world of Alcools, with its atmosphere of myth and magic. At the end of "Zone," after a walk that takes him across Paris and deep into the geography of his childhood, the poet returns at dawn to his room, to sleep among fetishes, "inferior Christs of obscure hopes," in a world about to be severed from the past. For the final sunrise of Alcools brings not the rebirth of the old myths promised in "Picasso, peintre," but their death: "Farewell farewell / Sun slit throat." Adieu Adieu Soleil cou coup? "You are weary at last of this ancient world."61 So begins "Zone" and Alcools. With the completion of his 56.

"If we knew, the gods would awaken," reads the first line of "Picasso, peintre." The old world, slumbering in "Picasso, peintre," dying in Alcools, has nearly slipped away in "Ondes." And Apollinaire's poetry reveals a new concern with the art and life of the present. The Eiffel Tower of "Ondes" is no longer an ironic symbol of ancient pastoral, as it was in "Zone." In "Lettre-Oc?an" (III, 174-177), a "lyric ideogram" of 1914, it sends out messages like telegraph waves to the poet's brother in Mexico and to the world. The squeaking of the poet's new shoes, bits of conversation, sounds of buses, and cries of twentieth century sirens "Hou Hou ou ou" circle a central point, "300 meters high." In "Liens" (III, 159), another poem of the period, the pattern formed by vertical and horizontal lines, by rain-combed smoke and submarine cables, is reminiscent of a Cubist grid and of Cubist rimes. And the "po?mes-conversation," with their juxtaposed bits of speech, have been likened to the pasted fragments of collage and to Duchamp's "ready mades."62 "A travers l'Europe" (III, 190-191) is dedicated to Marc Chagall, painter of Paris and Vitebsk. And Robert Delaunay's presence can be felt throughout the poetry of "Ondes," not only in "Tour" (III, 190), dedicated to the painter, and in "Les Fen?tres" (III, 160-161), written for a catalogue of his painting, but also, more surprisingly, along with Picasso's in "Un Fant?me de nu?es," which deals ostensibly with saltimbanques, thin and shadowy, red and rose. "I very much like my poems written after Alcools," Apollinaire would write in 1915 from the war front. "They are the result of a completely new esthetic whose energies I have not since been able to recapture" (IV, 493, trans, mine). In his analyses of "Un Fant?me de nu?es," Philippe Renaud has suggested that the poem announces this new aesthetic.63 I would add that the poem alludes to three of the Circus pictures, all painted in 1905, and that it is a r??valuation, not only of Apollinaire's own work, but also of the Rose Period. Unlike "Picasso, peintre," which began with an invocation of the gods, "Un Fant?me" starts with a simple prose statement: "Since it was the day before July fourteenth / Around four in the afternoon / I went down to the street to see the clowns." Even the ordinary can be marvelous, Apollinaire suggests in "Sur les Proph?ties" (III, 178-179), another poem in "Ondes." It is not a question of religion or mysticism, he says, but of observation. Surveying the scene as through a movie camera, the poet of "Un Fant?me" seizes on the circular shape of the crowd, the spherical weights of the barbells, and the movement of fingers "rolling a cigarette bitter and delicious like life." The gesture of the fingers is banal, the object produced no less so, yet the cigarette burns with a fire as efficacious as the metaphysical flames of Alcools (III, 113-115). Transformed by fire and human breath, the cigarette becomes pure essence, as stains on the rugs the clowns spread out become notes of music. Intrigued by notions of pure art inherited from nineteenth-century aesthetics, Apollinaire, like Mallarm?, uses burning tobacco as a sign of purification.64 In an essay of 1912 entitled "On the Subject in Modern Painting," he had suggested that the increasingly abstract painting of his contemporaries would someday be to more traditional art as music is to poetry. The new art would not, however, destroy the old. Music, after all, had not supplanted literature, nor had the "acrid taste of tobacco replace[d] the savor of food." (AoA, 197-198). Rather than contemplating a mystic interior landscape, as he had in "Cr?puscule," one of the poems in Alcools inspired by the Rose Period, the poet of "Un Fant?me" focuses on the sights before him until they disappear, like the little clown of the piece, into harmony and form. It is striking that Apollinaire returned to the saltimbanques when he was most active in defending Cubism and Orphism, and when his exuberance for the avant-garde was evident in his poetry. Apollinaire does not change his high opinion of the Rose Period in 1913, but he does call into question the vision he had earlier brought to that troubling and elusive art. Standing mute at the threshold of this century, bathed in the uncertain light of the last, Picasso's clowns were enigmatic. As subject, they were fragile, and that fragility haunted the poet. In "Picasso, peintre," Apollinaire had spoken of the mysteries of the Rose 62. See Durry, II, 203; Renaud, Lecture, pp. 259, 320, 345, 377, 378, et passim. 63.

In an essay published in 1912, he remarks instead on the calm and grace of their objective form (AoA, 196). In "Un Fant?me de nu?es," the clowns are no longer privileged merely by virtue of their character or heritage. The pseudo-Hermetic world of "Picasso, peintre" is no more. And morbidity, no longer a sign of initiation, is an emblem of the disintegration of the figure. Of the three clowns in "Un Fant?me de nu?es" based on Picasso's Family of Saltimbanques (fig. 2), one decomposes, another dissolves, a third is a hoodlum. As for Apollinaire's organ grinder, he is closer in spirit to the madmen of the Blue Period and "Picasso, peintre" than to Picasso's Organ-Grinder (1905, fig. 6). He is perhaps also, as Renaud suggests, an ironic double of the poet of Alcools and the traditional lyric poet.65 Swarming with the past, dreaming of the future, he grinds out a strange and dissonant lament. He is savage, not in the fashion of the "primitive" peoples whose sophisticated art Apollinaire and Picasso admired,66 but in the more frightening manner of the once "civilized." His face, like an ill-tended garden, is grown over with ancestral cinder. And when he hides his grizzled visage in his hands, fingers are "foetuses" growing out of his beard. Instead of ennobling Picasso's Organ-Grinder as he did other Rose Period figures in "Picasso, peintre," Apollinaire makes of the old musician (far from grotesque in the painting) a monster, and a prisoner, of time. "Un Fant?me," however, does not depict the Rose Period merely as a source of decay and superannuation. From under the ashen shadow of the old musician appears a little saltimbanque, a delicate new life: And when he balanced on a sphere His thin body became such delicate music that none of the onlookers could resist it And that music of shapes Destroyed the music of the mechanical organ That the man with the ancestor-covered face was grinding out Sitting at the feet of Picasso's organ-grinder is a small boy. The little saltimbanque of the poem is modeled in part on that figure. But where Picasso's clown is silent and immobile, Apollinaire's does not come to life until he begins to move. The child's mastery may surprise those who, hearing his "brief cries," "redskin cries," thought him a tiny savage, a fauve. Other artists too?sculptors of Africa and Oceania?were considered primitive by some, Apollinaire noted elsewhere. Yet they too created works the poet described as graceful and delicate. The little clown looks back to the primitivism of Rimbaud's "Bateau ivre," with its shouting redskins, and may suggest the "primitivism" of non-Western art.67 But the figure stands above all for the primitive and childlike in modern Western art. "I want to be as though newborn," Klee had written in 1902, "knowing . . . nothing about Europe ... to be almost primitive."68 For Apollinaire, Picasso was heir to Michelangelo, but he was also "a newborn child" who "orders the universe with a brutality that knows . . . how to be gracious" (AoA, 196, 280). The little clown is an innocent and a "primitive," but not in the manner of the young boys and adolescent girls of "Picasso, peintre." His art is not born of pain or memory, knowledge or emotion. It is an art of pure movement and presence. Facing the crowd the organ grinder had been too self-absorbed to see, the little saltimbanque makes a gesture reminiscent of a sign of benediction. Here, however, symbol is eclipsed by a new preoccupation with shape and motion. Once he steps on the ball, the clown's movements lose nearly all conventional meaning. The source of the image is Young Acrobat on a Ball (fig. 3), the painting Apollinaire had evoked eight years earlier in "Picasso, peintre." In "Un Fant?me," however, the adolescent sisters of the essay, initiates in mystical rites, have been replaced by a wild little boy. And the feat, to which Apollinaire had assigned great metaphysical weight, is portrayed as a triumph of lightness and balance. No longer identified with the cosmos, save by its harmonious rhythms, the ball is simply a sphere, and the little clown's art is synonymous with the movement of his delicate form. 65.

In the Rose, he implied in that essay, meaning resided not only in the figure, but also in line and color that "tell the force and duration of passion." The child's art in "Un Fant?me," however, represents neither ideas nor emotions. Like the notes of the "purest" music, the lines of the most abstract painting, his gestures do not represent objects or ideas, yet they echo the rhythm of the universe, radiating like light, transforming the world. If the little clown is a charmed figure, it is because of what he creates, and because his arrival, "la veille du quatorze juillet," marks a tenuous emancipation of art from the precious baggage of the past. The little clown, like his fellows, is an outsider, and a descendant of ancient wanderers, but he is fresh and newborn. Where his predecessors stood immobile in a misty and timeless landscape, he appears on a Paris street corner and performs for all the populace, not merely the initiated or an elect, an art of exquisite harmony and grace. "An entirely new art is thus being evolved," Apollinaire had written in his 1912 article on "The Subject," "an art that will be to painting, as painting has hitherto been envisaged, what music is to literature. It will be pure painting, just as music is pure literature" (AoA, 197). Discussion of the purity and nonreferentiality of music in its relation to poetry was commonplace in the late nineteenth century, as were formalist notions of painting. But Apollinaire witnessed what he believed to be the gradual disappearance of the image from painting itself. And while he may have been less than accurate in 1912, when he associated Picasso's work with abstraction (AoA, 198), other painters influenced by Cubism, among them Delaunay, were perhaps evolving toward an art where "the subject no longer counts or if it counts it counts for very little" (AoA, 197). Robert Delaunay elaborated his aesthetic notions in the course of long conversations with Apollinaire, and it is likely that his ideas inform the esthetic of "Un Fant?me."69 Ultimately, however, Apollinaire associated abstraction with many artists. In Figure 6. Picasso, The Organ-Grinder, 1905. Kunsthaus, Zurich. ? SPADEM, Paris/VAGA, New York, 1987. the article of 1912 on "The Subject," he tells the story of Apelles and Protogenes, who vied in drawing lines so fine and subtle that they gave more pleasure than representations of gods and goddesses (AoA, 198). As early as 1908, Apollinaire had criticized art that slavishly imitates the anthropomorphic and the natural, that is, divine Creation. For Apollinaire, abstraction seems to have stood both for the liberation of human creativity from the divine and for the possibility of transcendence in the absence of religious myth.70 69. Apollinaire played an important role in presenting Delaunay's ideas to the public, especially in two essays of 1912, both written with the aid of notes provided by the painter (AoA, 259-265). The essays, Francastel notes, constitute "une sorte de dialogue du peintre et du po?te sur les th?mes fournis par le premier." See Francastel's comment in Delaunay, p. 145. Delaunay's notion of pure art, his equation of painting and music, and his description of inferior art as mechanical, successive, and destructive, are echoed in Apollinaire's portraits of the little clown and the organ grinder. See Delaunay, 149, 157, et passim. For more detailed analysis of the role of Delaunay's work in Apollinaire's poetry, see Eberiel, "Apollinaire," pp. 108 164. 70.

But he had begun to seek the marvelous and the sublime in new, less sentimental and anthropomorphic creations. There are glimpses in "Un Fant?me de nu?es" of what a poetic equivalent of the child's music might be. Yet, in many respects, the poem is a quite traditional work of symbolic exposition reminiscent of Baudelaire's "Vieux Saltimbanque."71 And although the little clown's arrival heralds the advent of an art both more abstract and more realistic than the old, it is elsewhere in Galligrammes that one finds that promise fulfilled.72 "I am here to judge the long debate," Apollinaire would write in 1918, the year of his death. "Between tradition and invention / Between Order and Adventure" ("La Jolie Rousse").73 In his biography of Apollinaire, Marcel Ad?ma suggests that Apollinaire, Picasso, and Max Jacob, through their friendship and collaboration, invented a new aesthetic.74 Still, it is interesting to remember that when they met, neither Apollinaire nor Picasso was working in a truly avant garde mode. Poised on the brink of modernism, they had not yet broken with the art of the past. In the years that followed the Rose Period, Apollinaire, through his criticism, and most especially his poetry, would explore what seemed to be infinite new artistic possibilities: "Be indulgent when you compare us / To those who were the perfection of order / We who look for adventure everywhere."75 From Montmartre, in the sunset of western myth and the twilight of Symbolism, Apollinaire and Picasso would go to the Trocad?ro to confront strange and new figures of magic. But before that, still under the spell of an earlier century, they went with their friends to the Cirque M?drano, to see the clowns.76 Appendix I GUILLAUME APOLLINAIRE Young Artists: Picasso the Painter* If we knew, all the gods would awaken. Born of the profound knowledge that humanity had of itself, the adored pantheisms that resembled it have gone to sleep. But despite eternal slumbers, there are eyes that reflect humanities resembling divine and joyous phantoms. Those eyes are attentive like flowers that wish ever to contemplate the sun. O fecund joy, there are men who see with those eyes! Picasso has looked at human images that floated in the azure of our memories and that partake of the divine to the damnation of metaphysicians. How pious are his skies stirred by the movement of wings, his lights heavy and low like the lights of grottoes. There are children who have wandered without learning the catechism. They stop and the rain dries up. "Look! There are people who live in these hovels, and they are poorly dressed." These children whom no one caresses understand so much. Mommy, love me a lot! They know how to jump and the feats they accomplish are mental evolutions. These women who are no longer loved remember. They are tired of ironing their brittle ideas today. They do not pray; their devotion is to their memories. They huddle in the twilight like an ancient church. These women are giving up, and their fingers are eager to weave crowns of straw. At daybreak, they disappear, they have consoled themselves in silence. They have passed through many doors: mothers protected the content with classic and anthropomorphic representation, the artists of his time, Apollinaire felt, sought new sources of the ideal and the sublime: "Wishing to attain the proportions of the ideal and not limiting themselves to humanity, the young painters offer us works that are more cerebral than sensible. They are moving further and further away from the old art of optical illusions and literal proportions, in order to express the grandeur of metaphysical forms. That is why today's art, although it does not emanate directly from specific religious beliefs, nevertheless possesses several of the characteristics of great art, that is to say, of religious art" (AoA, 223). 71. See Baudelaire, III, 35-37. 72. The more avant-garde poems of "Ondes" include "Les Fen?tres" (III, 160-161), written for a catalogue of Delaunay's exhibition at the gallery of Der Sturm in 1912; "Lundi rue Christine" (III, 172-173, with its references to Cubism, and the "lyric ideogram" "Lettre-Oc?an" (III, 174-177). 73.

They have often given thanks, and their forearms trembled like their eyelids. Enveloped in icy mists, the old men wait without pondering, for children alone ponder. Stirred by faraway lands, by the quarrels of animals, and by hardened tresses, these old men can beg without humility. Other beggars have been worn out by life. They are the cripples, the disabled, and the knaves. They are astonished at having reached the goal that has remained blue yet is no longer the horizon. Growing old, they have become mad like kings with too many herds of elephants carrying miniature citadels. There are travelers who confuse flowers with stars. Grown old the way oxen die at twenty-five, young men have carried infants suckled by the moon. In pure sunlight, women remain silent, their bodies are angelic and their glances tremble. In the face of danger, their smiles become internal. They await fear to confess innocent sins. For the space of one year, Picasso lived this painting, wet and blue like the humid depths of the abyss, and pitiful. Pity made Picasso more harsh. The public squares held up a hanged man stretching himself against the houses above oblique passers-by. These tortured men were waiting for a redeemer. The cord swung away, miraculously; on the mansard roofs, the windowpanes blazed with the flowers of the windows. In bedrooms, poor painters drew fleecy nudes by lamplight. The women's shoes abandoned near the bed suggested tender haste. Calm descended after this frenzy. The harlequins live beneath their ragged finery while the painting gathers, heats up, or whitens its colors in order to tell of the strength and the duration of passions, while the lines outlining the costume curve, soar up, or are cut short. Paternity transfigures the harlequin in a square room while his wife bathes herself with cold water and admires herself, as slender and frail as her husband, the puppet. A neighboring fireplace sends some warmth into the caravan. Lovely songs mingle in the air and soldiers pass elsewhere, cursing the day. Love is good when it is adorned and the habit of living in one's own home redoubles the paternal sentiment. The child brings together the father and the wife, whom Picasso sees as glorious and immaculate. The expectant mothers were no longer expecting the child, perhaps because of certain chattering crows and evil omens. No?l! They gave birth to future acrobats amid the familiar monkeys, the white horses, and the bearlike dogs. The adolescent sisters, trading and balancing themselves on the great balls of the saltimbanques, impart to those spheres the radiant movement of the planets. These girlish adolescents, children still, have the anxieties of innocence; animals teach them the religious mysteries. Some harlequins accompany the aura of the women and resemble them, neither male nor female. Color has the flat quality of frescoes, and the lines are firm. But placed at the outer limits of life, the animals are human and the sexes indistinct. Hybrid beasts have the consciousness of the demigods of Egypt; the cheeks and brows of taciturn clowns are withered by morbid sensibilities. One cannot confuse these saltimbanques with mere actors on a stage. The spectator who watches them must be pious, for they celebrate wordless rites with painstaking agility. This is what distinguishes this painter from the Greek potters, whom his drawing sometimes calls to mind. On the painted vases, bearded, verbose priests sacrificed resigned animals bound to no destiny. In these paintings virility is beardless, but it manifests itself in the muscles of the skinny arms and flat cheekbones, and the animals are mysterious. Picasso's penchant for the fleeting trait transforms and penetrates and produces almost unique examples of linear drypoints, in which the general aspect of the world is not altered by the light that modifies forms by altering colors. More than all the poets, sculptors, and other painters, this Spaniard stings us like a sudden chill. His meditations are laid bare in silence. He comes from far away, from the richness of composition and brutal decoration of the Spaniards of the seventeenth century. Those who have known him remember fiery outbursts that were already more than mere experiments. His perseverance in the pursuit of beauty has led him on his way. He has seen himself ethically more of a Latin, rhythmically more of an Arab.
