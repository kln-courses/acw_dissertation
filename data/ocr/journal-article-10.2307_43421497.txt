<plain_text><page sequence="1">Modern Discoveries in Medical Psychology. By Clifford Ałłen, M.D., M.R.C.P., D .P.M. [Pp. X + 280.] (London : Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1937. 8 s. 6 d. net.) In the first page of this book the author reminds us of the old gibe at academic psychology as 4 4 the description of the perfectly obvious in terms of the unintelligible " and after reading this truly interesting, even enter- taining, account of the progress of morbid (abnormal) psychology through the fairy lands of childhood, the totems of primitive people, the mysticisms of prophets, the entanglements of the conscious and the unconscious, the craving (libido) of sex and other aggressions, the confusion of love and hate, of projection and introjection and above all the curious personal interpreta- tions of subjective symptoms by the protagonists of different schools of investigation, we feel that the gibe still holds good ; and of necessity, for as yet psychology cannot aspire to scientific status. It is in the phase of collecting data, a stupendous array of variables, and there is no machinery by which they can be assessed or correlated, no yard-stick to measure them. Science cannot rely upon guessing and subjective feeling. Apart from these considerations Dr. Allen has given us an excellent account of the different schools of psychological procedure. Of these the most outstanding is the Freudian school, dominated by the sex idea, respon- sible for the " (Edipus Complex," and the method of treatment known as</page><page sequence="2">394 SCIENCE PROGRESS $t psycho-analysis," which has perhaps given help to patients and con- tributed to the knowledge of psychic processes, but which is especially notorious for the persistent and virulent opposition it has received from the medical world. Following upon Freud came the school of Adler, a less unpleasant and saner school in which sex has no prominence and is replaced by " aggression " - the craving for a goal. It is certain that many neurotics can be cured by Adler' s method of analysis which is simpler, quicker and probably less dangerous than Freud's method, which may be prolonged over years. Adler's methods are used by all who treat children for neurotic troubles, and it seems likely that the Child Guidance Clinic will become a permanent memorial to Adler's fame. After Adler came Jung, a deserter from Freud's school. The account of his principles, given in Chapter VII, leaves us far out at sea. The author refers to them as obscure. We find them unintelligible. The final and most interesting chapter in the book is the only one that makes any scientific appeal. It deals with the great researches of Pavlov and the machinery of the mind. The discovery of conditioned reflexes, an extension of the view first put forward by Herbert Spencer, that instincts are nothing but complicated reflexes. The salivation of a hungry dog when shown food was regarded by Pavlov as a purely mechanical matter - like pulling its foot away from a hot iron, and he proceeded 4 4 to investigate the characters of this reflex as though it was a simple spinal cord reflex and not a complex psychical one." (The italios are ours.) It seems to us a pity to introduce psychology here. Surely, having secured the problem in a physical and measurable environment, solution is in sight and has no use for subjective surmises or anthropomorphic attitudes. This book has given us great pleasure and instruction, and should be valuable to medical men who have the time and interest for psychological questions. The addition of an index would be much help to the reader. P. J.</page></plain_text>
