<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITATIONS OF MAYAN CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT' MILTON ALTSCHULER THIS PAPER will deal with a double problem raised by Meggers2 concerning the origin and development of Classic Mayan civilization. Meggers claims that an area whose soil is characterized as being of limited agricultural potential can neither give birth to nor support a high civilization. This is the rationale under- lying Steward's3 contention that the Tropical Forest culture of South America is derived from the Circum-Caribbean culture, and is the result of the diminution and filtering out of various features under the influence of the tropical rainforest environment. Similarly, the deculturative effects of a limited environment on a high culture is illustrated by Meggers' work on Maraj6 Island at the mouth of the Amazon River. The Marajoara culture appears suddenly at the height of its socio-political complexity. Mounds were constructed, and potters and other craftsmen were en- gaged in a wide variety of special tasks. The archaeological sequence then demon- strates the course of deculturation to the Tropical Forest level. Complex wares . . . those utilizing two or more types of surface treatment such as slipping or double slipping with excision or incision and slipping with incision followed by painting, are most abundant at the earlier sites and decline markedly with the pas- sage of time. Concurrently, the technical quality of the excised designs and the amount of vessel surface that they cover is noticeably reduced. The wares showing increases in popularity are with one exception (Carmelo Red) unslipped and the excised, incised or scraped decoration is applied directly to the vessel surface; in other words, the types of the increase are those that require less time for their execution.4 Another instance of the efficacy of the environmental limitations on cultural development can be seen in Rouse's5 analysis of Circum-Caribbean archaeology, which demonstrates the sequence, Marginal to Tropical Forest to Circum-Carib- bean without any further advance. From the above data, Meggers derives three principles. If a high culture moves into an area of low agricultural potential, the archaeology will reveal that " (1) it 1 The author wishes to thank Dr Charles E. Dibble for his constructive criticism.

We will test Meggers' conclusions against the archaeological evidence and we shall see that the Mayan civilization, marked by the complex of the stela cult, corbeled arches, monuments, hieroglyphs, basal-flanged polychrome bowls, and tripod vases with covers, was not introduced from outside the area. The evidence will indicate that there was a period of development in situ, and then a rather sudden decline. Our demonstration of the autochthonous nature of Classic Mayan culture will do little violence to Meggers' thesis. If she is basically correct, we should be able to correlate the decline of Classic Mayan culture with the environmental limita- tions. To do this the two components (environment and culture) must be treated on the same level. .... In order to detect possible relationships, culture must be reduced to a similar level of generalization and specific features categorized under concepts such as "social classes," "occupational division of labor."' This we will attempt to do after first examining some of the archaeology of the area, in order to define within limits, the possible locus of origin of Mayan civilization. Examination of the underlying local Formative cultures reveals widespread trade, the beginnings of architecture, and a well developed art. This seems to indi- cate that the discontinuity between the Formative and Classic periods is not as clear-cut as Meggers maintains. On the contrary, Formative development into the Classic Mayan was fairly wide spread. Brainerd, in a Yucatan survey, found at the site of Uaxactun a high mound which produced almost pure Late Formative pot- tery. At Santa Rosa Xtampak a trench dug at the location of the eight Mayan stelae of the site pierced several floors. . . . All the pottery from under the first two floors and in the fill is Middle and Late Formative. It seems reasonable to conclude that at least the Middle and Late Formative periods in Yucatan saw the erection of massive religious centers by the large, well organized groups necessary for such tasks. Certainly, this part of the Mayan culture pattern began long before the stela cult.8 6 Meggers, 1954, p. 818. 7 Idem, pp. 805-806. 8 Brainerd, 1951, p. 76.</page><page sequence="3">MAYAN CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 191 He concludes that there is no evidence of strong culture change occurring between the Formative and the follow- ing stage, although in the Peten the beginning of the erection of stelae and vaults form good markers. The available evidence, though meagre, suggests that large religious centers, presumably built under a theocratic government, began by Middle Formative times in Yucatan, and that this pattern continued on the same sites with no major upheavals until the Mexican penetration at about 1000 A.D.9 That the Formative period made an excellent base for Classic Mayan civiliza- tion was further indicated by Kidder's early excavations at Kaminaljuju, Guate- mala. He had been unable to find rich graves or formal tombs, and all indications pointed to a simple unstratified society. It was later found that at this early period large religious structures were built. At one mound which was over twenty meters high, a random sample of more than six thousand sherds showed that they all were Miraflores (Formative). At San Jose, some 100 kilometers to the south, Mira- flores pottery was found in two superimposed graves on top of a large terraced mound. Kidder maintains that "This of course settles the question of Miraflores mound building and makes it practically certain that the huge brickworks example was of that phase.""' It appears that the Formative period can be divided into three phases, of which Miraflores is the terminal. The oldest is Las Charcas, fol- lowed by Sacatepequez. Shook and Kidder's later report indicates that pyramid construction may go back to Las Charcas. In any event, with regard to Mound E-111-3, the authors state that . . . it is now clear that the Mirafloreno had developed an economy sufficiently stable to permit great amounts of labor to be expended for nonproductive ends and a type of government, supposedly theocratic, that was capable of marshaling and efficiently di- recting the efforts of a large number of workers.1l In the Peten area, two Formative pottery sequences have been marked. The earlier is called Mamom and the later stage is called Chicanel. The type site is at Uaxactun. Ricketson speaks of Period 1 pottery forming two groups, la and lb (Mamom and Chicanel). Period lb is seen as a development out of la and is very likely contemporaneous with some of the primary buildings of Group E. Although the ceramics of this period have strong 'Archaic' affinities, it can not definitely be said to be out of the Mayan tradition, and should be described . . . as early Mayan rather than pre-Mayan.12 9 Idem, p. 77. 10 Kidder, 1946, p. 242. 11 Shook and Kidder, 1952, pp. 122-123. 12 Ricketson, 1937, p. 231.</page><page sequence="4">192 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY This analysis of the ceramic sequence coincides rather happily with Morley's state- ment on the art and architecture of Uaxactun. Speaking specifically of the stucco- covered pyramid E-VII-sub, he says that the style of the stucco masks is such as to indicate strongly that at the time they were executed Mayan art was just beginning to crystallize as such. Indeed, they are so simple and undeveloped as almost to suggest a proto-Mayan origin, as though the esthetic complex we now call Mayan art was only just coming into being when they were molded.13 At Uaxactun, the first pottery style to be associated with dated stelae is Tzakol, which follows immediately after Chicanel. The continuity14 between and among the ceramic sequences and art styles is further attested to by Proskouriakoff's recent analysis of structure E-VII-sub. Its decoration consists of 18 large masks, used in the design of the stairway. ... Eight of the masks are conventionalized renderings of the serpent motif; the others are anthropomorphic faces, not without some animal characteristics. On the foreheads of these faces are scrolls which, in structure, resemble the earliest forms found on stelae, and forms painted on Tzakol pottery. . . . There is no question that the period to which they belong is in the direct line of the Mayan artistic tradition.'5 In the Copan valley of Honduras, as at other sites, there is a discontinuity between the Formative stages and the Classic Mayan. The Formative pottery style (Longyear's Archaic) " consists only of coarse and burnished utilitarian ware, monochrome red or orange with simple modeling, grooving, and filleting. In the Early Classic period, these wares continue with decreasing frequency and parts of the Mayan complex makes its appearance. Throughout the sequence of Formative through Full Classic there is a steady decline in the frequency of animal and snail remains, which may indicate a change in the economic base from hunting and gathering to agriculture.17 This implies the introduction of a religious and govern- mental authority already well developed, coming in from another area. The dis- continuities between the Formative and Classic stages at Copan and elsewhere, coupled with the strong continuity found in Peten and the Yucatan peninsula in general, would suggest that the area may be the point of Mayan origin. Uaxactun, containing the oldest known stela date, shows the best stylistic continuity in art and ceramics, and also shows throughout its entire period of occupation, the most 13 Morley, 1938, p. 316. 14 J. L. Sorenson pointed out in a personal communication that a transitional phase, Matzanel, is now distinguished, emphasizing the continuity for which I argue. 15 Proskouriakoff, 1950, p. 102. 16 Longyear, 1952, pp. 22-23. 17 Longyear, 1951, pp. 86-92.</page><page sequence="5">MAYAN CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 193 conservative development of religious art and style, indicating that the point of Mayan origin may be further contracted to the Peten area. In addition to the purely archaeological material discussed above, Classic Mayan development out of a Formative base can be inferred in another manner. We agree with Spinden that Mayan religion, mathematics, and astronomy are not the collateral products of the civilization, but must rather "be regarded as the true cause and original ferment which produced these arts and ceremonies which now seem to us so wonderful.""8 Brainerd, in a similar vein, points out that "internal evidence from the Mayan calendar also assures us that calendric observa- tions were taken during the last several hundred years of the Formative period, presumably by an organized Mayan priesthood." 19 The brief survey presented above, while certainly far from being complete, does serve to indicate that the three environmental principles put forth by Meggers do not fit the Mayan data. However, we still have to explain the rather sudden decline of the Classic Mayan culture. Meggers maintains that "the breakdown came because the subsistence base, originally unsuited to the support of the occupa- tional division of labor and other social features associated with advanced tech- nology, was overtaxed to the point of collapse."'2 Now the problem of intensive agriculture and soil depletion in the Mayan area is still an open one. We will take the position here, that the breakdown came not necessarily because of an inade- quate subsistence base alone, but more importantly because the "sociological im- peratives" of the subsistence base as reflected in Mayan milpa agriculture were such that the maintenance of a class-structured state organization was, while not impossible, extremely difficult. Franz Oppenheimer pointed out that man lives and obtains a livelihood by one of two basically opposed means. These are the political means and the economic means. He defines the economic means as "one's own labor and the equivalent exchange of one's own labor for the labor of others . . . while the unrequited appropriation of the labor of others will be called the political means."21 This distinction serves to clarify the confusion put forth by Marxist theorists who view all manifestations of force, slavery, religion, and class as economic factors. Now economics is held to its proper sphere of limiting the development of the political means in a state organization. In other words, the political means are the coercive measures that buttress the developing techniques of economic exploitation. Oppen- heimer, in righteous indignation, called this robbery. We will talk in terms of the administration and control of the forces of production. 18 Spinden, 1940, p. 164. 19 Brainerd, 1954, p. 20. 20 Meggers, 1954, p. 819. 21 Oppenheimer, 1914, p. 25.</page><page sequence="6">194 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Millon, writing on the development of the state in the Viru valley of Peru, claims that state organization implies the necessary existence of a class structured society, and that ". . . the key to the development of classes lies in the develop- ment of control over productive techniques necessary to the survival by one seg- ment of that society."22 He goes on to say that "what starts as a necessary administration of production becomes inevitably transformed into a control of pro- duction."23 It would perhaps be best to speak of the control of some spheres of production, as total control would be too sophisticated at this stage. In Millon's theory of state development, the state organization is seen to be inimicable, as a basis for political organization, to a kinship organized society. With the develop- ment of the control of production, the kin groups are economically disenfranchised. In both situations, however, it is possible to have a class society. But in the state- organized society the classes are highly structured politically, whereas in a kin society, the classes are structured economically, as defined by Oppenheimer, and are somewhat amorphous in nature. The Maya of the Classic period were prob- ably somewhere on the continuum between the two extremes. That this was so in late pre-conquest Yucatan is indicated by Roys who states that "Yucatecan society was also divided vertically into lineage groups. Many of these included nobles and commoners alike. .. . ."24 If we can show where, because of their peculiar subsistence base, the Classic Maya were able to amass a food reserve to tide them over from harvest to harvest, but only a limited surplus above the necessary reserve, and that milpa agriculture favored the administration of production rather than its control and hence had a government but not a state, it would be reasonable to assume that the class system was in Oppenheimerian terms, kin-based and economically structured, but politi- cally unstructured. Mayan agriculture practices, by their very nature, did not involve the necessary development of central control for their ordinary operation. Such administration as was needed was probably done on a kinship base, either through the family or lineage heads. Construction of the many religious city centers required some form of governmental authority for obvious reasons. But governmental authority per se does not necessarily imply a state organization with a politically structured class society. What is involved in governmental authority according to Millon is the concentration in the hands of a few members of the kin-group - of the self-acting armed power of the entire group. But this concentration is an administrative concen- 22 Millon, 1952, p. 51. 23 Idem, p. 52. 24 Roys, 1943, p. 35.</page><page sequence="7">MAYAN CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 195 tration. It involved no control, of force by those entrusted with its administration. .... State power, on the other hand, is based upon monopolization of force - upon total control of it.25 The class structure which developed in the Mayan "Old Empire" was poorly de- veloped politically. Its content and techniques of expropriation were largely reli- gious in nature. It was the religious values of the peasant population that allowed of a ready source of labor for the construction of the cities and monuments. Recently the question of Mayan urbanism and its nature has been raised. Willey points out that the formal demographic requirements of urbanism, in the strictest sense, do not seem to be present in the Mayan lowlands in Classic times. . ... Yet lacking this, the Maya achieved city life in the broader sense, for many of the attributes of civiliza- tion . . . are clearly present.26 Seemingly the settlement patterns of the Classic Maya represent something of an anomaly in terms of other known urban patterns. Shook and Proskouriakoff avoid the problem when they say that the Maya had a "significant stage of urban growth" and that it is not necessary to state "more precisely the degree of economic interdependence or the type of social organization that such a stage entails."27 We suggest that the "anomalous" urban settlement pattern is related to an economi- cally-structured class society. "Traditional" urban settlement patterns seem to relate to politically structured class societies. The problem is now before us. Can we account for the sudden decline of the Classic Maya in terms of socio-environmental factors? Out of the economically structured class society there developed a rapidly growing class of priests and nobles. This is inferred by the increase in size and complexity of the temple con- structions. At some point the priests and nobles began to require a food surplus over and above the reserve needed to tide the society over from harvest to harvest. But only a ruling class that has developed the techniques of expropriation, as in the so-called "Hydraulic Civilizations," can demand and exact an increasing sur- plus. And the surplus can only be forthcoming if the agricultural base permits. The ruling class did not develop the techniques of expropriation because of the lack of necessary control inherent in the milpa system of agriculture. Further, while the question of soil depletion is still an open one, the normal climatic factors that con- trol the success or failure of the harvest, leave such a narrow margin of safety,28 that a surplus as distinguished from a reserve, cannot be guaranteed. The insistence 25 Millon, 1952, p. 51. 26 Willey, 1956, p. 780. 27 Shook and Proskouriakoff, 1956, p. 93. 28 Hester, 1954, pp. 23-27.</page><page sequence="8">196 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY of the ruling class upon a surplus under these environmental and sociological con- ditions, can, if it persists, lead to social disorganization. Thompson29 speaks of a series of peasant rebellions. The peasants may have refused the exorbitant demands of the priestly hierarchy for increased food and labor. Lacking well-developed techniques of coercion, the theocratic elements would have been helpless in the face of armed peasant resistance. There is, of course, no one prime-mover. It may have been that all of the above factors were coupled with disease brought on by con- tamination of the water supply. Dense living conditions and the shallow water table would have required strong controls which seem to have been lacking. In any case, Coe's statement that the "lowland Mayan accomplishments deserve to stand as an impressive rejection of the 'Law of Environmental Limitation on Cul- ture',"30 can perhaps be modified. While Meggers' environmental determinism is clearly untenable, it would appear that the limits of environmental probabilism are quite applicable. The Classic Maya are a special case of environmental limitation. SUMMARY We have examined the archaeology of the Mayan area, and the evidence indi- cates that contrary to Meggers' position, the Classic Mayan civilization was an autochthonous development in an "area of limited agricultural potential." In terms of the decline of the Classic Maya, Meggers' view is that the Maya came into the lowlands a class-structured society and then broke down because of an inade- quate subsistence base. Our view is that the sociological concomitants of milpa agriculture plus the uncertainties of the harvest were such that certain sociological possibilities could be profitably exploited and others could not. In other words, the area could easily support, and did, an economically-structured class society, gov- ernmentally organized. It could not easily support, and in fact did not support, a politically-structured class society that was state organized. The breakdown came when a political structuring was attempted by a ruling class that lacked well- developed techniques of exploitation. BIBLIOGRAPHY BRAINERD, G.
