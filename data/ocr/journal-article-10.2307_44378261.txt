The difference in personality to be ignored. (284) - Thomas Hardy, entry in The Early Life of Thomas Hardy THOMAS HARDY WROTE THE WELL-BELOVED NEAR THE END OF his career as a novelist, publishing the first, serialized version - entitled The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved - in 1 892, after his publisher held up production of Tess of the ďUrbervilles because of moral objections. Only after he had written and published Jude the Obscure did Hardy revise the ending and change the title to The Well-Beloved , publishing the novel in book form in 1 897. The Well-Beloved tells the unusual story of a man who falls in love with a woman; then, twenty years later, with the woman's daughter; and finally, forty years later, with the woman's granddaughter. I To understand the nature of desire in The Well-Beloved , it is necessary first to look at several important theories of desire and their relationship to the nineteenth-century novel. In his famous analysis of desire and the novel, René Girard argues that desire in the nineteenth-century novel is never spontaneous, never emerging from the individual - or "subject" - who desires (28-29). Rather, desire is "imitated" desire produced in response to or initiated by an Other, different from the desired object (2 1 ). This Other may be a rival who stimulates jealousy in the desiring subject, or it may be a "model," what Sigmund Freud calls an "ego ideal," whom the desiring subject wishes to emulate. In either case, there is always a third person, the "mediator," and desire is always triangular - a structure involving the subject, the mediator, and the object (Girard 1 7). Girard says that triangular desire is always borrowed, copied, and belated. And triangular desire is bound up with the constitution of the subject. As Girard says, "Imitated desire is always a desire to be Another" (83). 77</page><page sequence="2">Owen Schur From a slightly different perspective, Leo Bersani in A Future for Astyanax: Character and Desire in Literature argues that the nineteenth- century novel of realism is a response to the fear of desire. According to Bersani, "Desire is an activity within a lack; it is an appetite stimulated by an absence. But it is never only a lack. Desire is a hallucinated satisfaction in the absence of the source of satisfaction" (10). As a drive of the imagination, desire can be disruptive. Part of the conservative ideology of the nineteenth-century novel is to subsume disruptive desire within accept- able narrative and social structures, such as marriage. Bersani observes: In formal terms, disruptive desire could be thought of as a disease of disconnectedness in a part of the structure which rejects being defined by its relations to other parts and asserts, as it were, a scandalous affinity with elements alien to the structure. (66) He goes on to note that "the containment of desire is a triumph for social stability" (73). Bersani sees this "containment" in the frequent recourse to marriage at the end of realistic novels: [T]he happy marriages of Elizabeth and Darcy, of Little Dorrit and Arthur Clennam, and of Dorothea and Will Ladislaw are the just consequences and rewards of just perceptions of char- acter. They are the reliable signs of the hero's and the heroine's matured consciousness, as well as an indication of what consti- tutes a "natural" social order in all these novels. (55) In opposition, the Crawfords in Mansfield Park represent floating desire and improvised or undefined selves and are scapegoats who must undergo symbolic expulsion from the novel - while Fanny never expresses her desires and is "a stable, nondesiring center of judgement" (Bersani 77). In Mansfield Park, Jane Austen proposes - in Bersani's words - an "ethic of stillness" (75). However, Bersani does not argue that all nineteenth-century novels fit this pattern. In his discussion of Wuthering Heights , for example, he shows how Emily Bronte explores disruptive desire in Heathcliff and Catherine without passing judgment on it or attempting to contain it in social or narrative structures. Even here, though, "The latter part of Wuthering Heights is a repudiation of its own radical difference from other novels" (222). The love between the second Catherine and Hareton excludes Heathcliff as scapegoat and subsumes desire within the stable structures of marriage and family. 78</page><page sequence="3">Critic 57.2 For Girard, then, desire in the novel is "imitation" mediated by an Other; for Bersani, desire is the experience of a "lack," an "appetite" of the imagination, which in the realistic novel is feared as disruptive. Both conceptions of desire may be relevant to The Well-Beloved. In Thomas Hardy: Distance and Desire , however, J. Hillis Miller suggests yet another possible function of desire: Desire can be a displacement of religious belief ( 1 30). In a world without God, the desiring subject may project divine power into the desired object. In The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, ostensibly written by Florence Emily Hardy but actually written by Hardy himself, Hardy says, "I have been looking for God for 50 years, and I think if he had existed I should have discovered him" (293). Substitute " Well-Béloved" for God and "she" for "he," and the statement describes Jocelyn Pierston's pursuit of ideal Love in The Well-Beloved. The narrative makes clear that what Pierston desires is in fact a goddess. He pursues the goddess Venus (Aphrodite), who merely assumes different forms at different times. Elsewhere, in a poem entitled "The Well-Beloved," Hardy makes this connection explicit. The speaker is looking for his bride when he is haunted by a woman's shape. This spirit tells him that his bride is a dream: Thou hast transferred To her dull form awhile My beauty, fame, and deed, and word, My gestures and my smile. . . . Thou lovest what thou dreamest her I am thy very dream! (Complete Poems 133-35). The spirit vanishes near where an altar to Venus once stood, and the idealized goddess departs from his bride, leaving her "pinched and thin, / As if her soul had shrunk and died, / And left a waste within." Likewise, Pierston believes, or holds a "superstition," that the goddess Aphrodite is the source of his desire, the cause of his endless pursuit. He acts out his obsession by creating sculpture after sculpture of Aphrodite: He was aware, however, that though it might be now as heretofore, the Loved who danced before him, it was the Goddess behind her who pulled the string of that Jumping Jill. He had lately been trying his artist hand again on the Dea's form in every conceivable phase and mood. He had become a one- part man - a presenter of her only. But his efforts had resulted in failures. In her implacable vanity she might be punishing him anew for presenting her so deplorably. (79) 79</page><page sequence="4">Owen Schur Later in the novel, the narrator comments: The Goddess, an abstraction to the general, was a fairly real personage to Pierston. He had watched the marble images of her which stood in his working room. Every line and curve of her body, none, naturally, knew better than he; and, though not a belief, it was, as has been stated, a formula, a superstition that the three Avices were interpenetrated with her essence. (154) Miller says that here Hardy "isolates the religious aspect of loving"; "Pierston's loving is desire not for the woman herself, but for the goddess who is momentarily incarnated in her person" (Distance and Desire 130). I find the idea that The Well-Beloved is primarily about religious desire unpersuasive, however. As Joseph Warren Beach writes in The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century English Poetry , Hardy does not believe in any God or gods, or providence having regard for men or other creatures. But he recognizes the anthropomorphic disposition to invent gods and blame them for the ills of life. He expressly declares that his characters are mistaken in doing so, and when he himself uses these terms, it is clear that it is ironically and satirically. (513) The narrator's comments on the Well-Beloved as a goddess are typical Hardyesque irony, somewhat like the comment at the end of Tess of the ďUrbervilles : "'Justice' was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess." Like the President of the Immortals, the Well-Beloved as the goddess Aphrodite is ironical figuration. II Nevertheless, while The Well-Beloved may not primarily be about reli- gious desire, Miller's general approach in Distance and Desire may help us understand the nature of desire in the novel. Miller argues that Hardy's poetry and fiction are characterized by a "refusal of involvement," an act of withdrawal from the world into a form of fascinated spectatorship (1- 37). This view has two implications: First, in the fiction there is a split between the distanced, detached narrators and the narrowly focused protagonists. Second, within the narratives, the relation between the desiring subject and the desired object is characterized by distance. But I have to disagree with Miller's conclusions concerning the reasons for this 80</page><page sequence="5">Critic 57.2 "refusal of involvement" and "spectatorship." In The Well-Beloved , this distance is not religious desire but a function of what I call Pierston's "sexual economy." In The Well-Beloved , Pierston's compulsion is to find a love object that is virtually unattainable, held out at a distance - a love object toward whom his attitude is one of detached spectatorship. Early in the novel, after Marcia Bencomb leaves him and the first Avice Caro marries her cousin, Pierston is compulsively drawn both toward and away from, in the narrator's words, the "search of the vanished Ideality" (66). The narrator states: Once or twice he imagined that he saw her in the distance - at the end of a street, on the far sands of a shore, in a window, in a meadow, at the opposite side of a railway station; but he determinedly turned on his heel, and walked the other way. (66; emphasis added) In this chapter, called "Familiar Phenomena in the Distance," Pierston either represses desire or displaces desire onto his sculptural figures: The study of beauty was his only joy for years onward. In the streets he would observe a face, or a fraction of a face, which seemed to express to a hair's-breadth in mutable flesh what he was at that moment wishing to express in durable shape. He would dodge and follow the owner like a detective; in omnibus, in cab, in steam-boat, through crowds, into shops, churches, theatres, public-houses, and slums - mostly, when at close quar- ters, to be disappointed for his pains. (67) A statement in the Early Life of Thomas Hardy bears relation to Pierston's propensity to pursue objects of "beauty," only to be disappointed. Hardy writes, " Loves lives on propinquity, but dies on contact" (288). Why is it that in such encounters Pierston's desire is so often disappointed or disappears? It is curious that the passage previously quoted from the novel directly precedes a description of Piers ton turning away from the pursued object toward a different figure. He gazes across the Thames to the wharves on the south side, and to that particular one whereat his father's tons of freestone were daily landed from the ketches of the south coast. He could occasionally discern the white blocks lying there, vast cubes so persistently nibbled by his parent from his island rock in the English Channel that it seemed as if in time it would be nibbled all away. (67) 81</page><page sequence="6">Owen Schur The turn from the pursued woman to the stone from his father's quarries constitutes "overdetermined" figuration, to borrow postmodern terminol- ogy, and reveals much about Pierston's sexual economy. Here, Pierston's desire is deflected from a real woman (seen, in the narrator's words, "at close quarters") toward his father, represented by his "father's tons of freestone." Desire becomes triangular, but in a reversal of Girard's "medi- ated desire" the subject does not imitate the third figure's desire. The third figure, here the father, does not produce the subject's desire but rather prohibits it. Pierston's relation to the woman becomes instead his relation to the Father. Hardy chooses some interesting words here. The blocks of stone are described as being "persistently nibbled by his parent," suggesting the possibility that "it [the rock/the object of desire] would be nibbled all away" (emphases added). The path of desire has led to an absence, to something's disappearing. In this sense, desire here conforms to Bersani's definition as the experience of a lack. But what is most curious about Hardy's choice of words lies in the oral imagery of the word "nibbled," which he uses twice in this passage. The image suggests the double feâr of women and of the father as castrating. But the ingestion image and the image of absence can be reversed and understood not only as a fear but also as a wish. If the stone represents the father and his livelihood, then the stone's being nibbled all away, being used up, would constitute his father's ruin. Desire here takes the form of the desire to kill the father/Father. In this light, the ingestive image assumes further significance. In Totem and Taboo, Freud postulates that the killing and devouring of the primal father is the vehicle through which sons incorporate and accomplish their identification with the Father (141 ). The word "nibbled" may be understood as devouring in this sense. This possibility is not as fanciful as it might first appear, because Pierston does literally use his father's stone to make his sculptures, consuming his father's stone, taking it away from him. And the "killing of the father" doesn't end there. Freud argues that killing the father causes guilt, which the sons try to allay by setting up a "totem," or substitute, of the father, which they then worship (145). The sculptures that Pierston carves out of the blocks of stone acquired from his father's quarries are not only figures for his desire to kill his father but also totems of the father, representing the son's guilt for the dead father, as well as identification with the father and the father's sexual prohibition. It is worth noting the phallic nature of the blocks of stone and the sculptures. Pierston displaces his desire onto these sculptures, which are overdetermined in yet another sense. In the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex, the subject enters what Jacques Lacan calls the "Sym- bolic Order" and finds a substitutive figure for the thing it most desires (61- 82</page><page sequence="7">Critic 57.2 67). Pierston's desire is derailed in that instead of loving a woman like the woman his father loved, he loves a figure of a figure, the Ideal Well- Beloved who exists in no real woman. He loves a representation of a representation, in a métonymie movement from signifier to signifier without reaching the signified. His is an example of Lacanian desire, in which the signified slides under the bar of repression (167). In Lacanian theory, desire is never satisfied, just as Pierston never satisfactorily achieves union with the three Avice Caros. III But in addition to being Lacanian, desire in The Well-Beloved bears the weight of cultural modernity. The second version of the novel was pub- lished in 1897, after Jude the Obscure , making it Hardy's final novel, after which he turned or, more precisely, returned to poetry. The Well-Beloved is perhaps his most modern novel, and its modernity can be seen to lie in its concern for figuration and representation in a cultural sense. The novel is obsessed with the idea of copies and photographs. Pierston says of the second Avice Caro that she is "this perfect copy" of her mother (103). When he kisses Avice the Second, he thinks of Avice the First, who, in the narrator's words, "had smiled under his kiss as the copy had done now" (107). The narrator says that Pierston has the "desire to make reparation to the original woman by wedding and enriching the copy" (1 20). When Pierston meets the third Avice, granddaughter of the first, he can't help "thinking of the extraordinary reproduction of the original girl in this new form he had seen, and of himself as of a foolish dreamer in being so suddenly fascinated by the renewed image" (156). In an essay entitled "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Walter Benjamin says, "that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art" (221), the aura being its authenticity within the domain of tradition. Benjamin places great emphasis on photographs and film in this cultural situation. Curiously enough, photographs appear often in The Well-Beloved. Pierston's most crucial fixation, his love for the first Avice Caro, originates while he is looking at a photograph he finds in a box of "odds and ends" after learning of her death: From the melancholy mass of papers, faded photographs, . . . and such like, Jocelyn drew a little portrait, one taken on glass in the primitive days of photography. . . . It was Avice Caro The effect of the glass was to lend to the picture much of the softness characteristic of the original. ... A 83</page><page sequence="8">Owen Schur long contemplation of the likeness completed what the letter had begun. He loved the woman dead and inaccessible as he had never loved her in life. (87-88) Pierston's desire is constituted more by the photographic image than by the literal woman. Just as his sculptured images of Aphrodite can be seen as figurative substitutions in Freudian and Lacanian terms, the reproducibil- ity and plurality of the photographic image of the love object situate his desire outside the domain of sanctioned tradition. But if Pierston's desire loses the aura of tradition, it gains, perhaps, the freedom of a democratized desire. Pierston may be a figure of male desire as subversive in the 1890s as Tess's struggle between desire and convention. The two different endings that Hardy wrote for the novel relate to the definitions of desire that I have proposed here. In the original (1892) version, Pierston looks at a photograph of the first Avice and compares her to his present wife. He laughs hysterically and bitterly at the "grotesqueness of things." Unsatisfied desire remains in force. In the revised (1897) version, which is more domesticated and less subversive, Pierston loses his desire for the three Avices. He says, "Thank Heaven I am old at last. The curse is removed" (202). The revised ending, in which he marries happily, suggests Hardy's decision at this stage of his career as a novelist to subsume disruptive desire within an acceptable social and narrative structure. Miller argues that with Pierston's recognition of his fixation, the distance between narrator and protagonist ends - and this, in Miller's view, could be an explanation for Hardy's ceasing to write novels. I would argue a quite different view. As with Te ss of the ďUrbervilles and Jude the Obscure , The Well-Beloved represents a desire too subversive for the reading public. Perhaps Hardy thought it wise to turn to the safer realms of poetry from the free play of desire in The Well-Beloved. Works Cited Beach, Joseph Warren.
