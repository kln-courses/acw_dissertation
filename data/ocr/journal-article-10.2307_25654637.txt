Association for Jewish Studies, 2009 doi: 10.1017/S0364009409990031 Mahazor Ha-Hayyim: Life-Cycle Celebration in the Song of the Ashkenazic Synagogue by Geoffrey Goldberg Joyous life-cycle events celebrated by American Ashkenazic Jews, especially those belonging to the more liberal denominations, invariably conclude with the singing of the words siman tov u-mazal tov, yehei lanu u-lekhol yisra 'eil (May it bring good luck to us and to all Israel).1 Whether after the long anxious minutes of the berit milah, the struggle of the youngster through the Hebrew text and trope of the haftarah, the calling up of the bridegroom (and the bride as well in most non-Orthodox synagogues) at an aufruf, or the breaking of the glass at a wedding, the spontaneous singing serves as a catharsis to relieve the built-up tensions of the communal ritual event as well as to express an outpouring of joy The celebration and commemoration of the Jewish life cycle (in Hebrew, mahazor ha-hayyim) has attracted the interest of modern historians, liturgists, and anthropologists. The musical dimension of these ceremonies, however, has often been underplayed by scholars in these disciplines.2 Ethnomusicologists, by contrast, have long recognized the centrality of music in Jewish life-cycle celebrations and have contributed to a growing body of scholarly literature on the subject.3 The vital role of music in such ceremonies was well put by Amnon Shiloah: 1. The song was published in Velvel Pasternak, Songs of the Chassidim (New York: Bloch, 1968), 125, no. 153. 2. Ivan G. Marcus writes that "rituals include words to be read out, chanted, sung (The Jewish Life Cycle: Rites of Passage from Biblical to Modern Times [Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004], 11), yet as a historian, he makes only three brief references to music in this otherwise excellent comprehensive work. The contributors to chapters on Jewish liturgy in Paul F. Bradshaw and Lawrence A. Hoffman, eds., Life Cycles in Jewish and Christian Worship (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1996), largely omit references to music. On the other hand, Harvey Goldberg emphasizes the importance of musical elements in a number of life-cycle events in his anthropological study Jewish Passages: Cycles of Jewish Life (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003). 3. The most recent studies include Susan Weich-Shahak, Judeo-Spanish Moroccan Songs for the Life Cycle: Recordings, Transcriptions and Annotations (Jerusalem: Jewish Music Research Center, 1989); Kay Kaufmann Shelemay, Let Jasmine Rain Down: Song and Remembrance among Syrian Jews (Chicago: Uni versity of Chicago Press, 1998); Yael Shai, "Yemenite Women's Songs at the Habani Jews' Wedding Cele brations," Musica Judaica 15 (2000-2001): 83-96; Miriam Meghani, "Canticas de parida: canti per la madre 305</page><page sequence="2">Geoffrey Goldberg A person's lifetime, from birth to death, is filled with a succession of outstand ing occasions, many of which are celebrated in song and dance. In the past, when means of entertainment were limited, if a family or ethnic group had extensive social ties, the celebration of various ceremonies would extend over several days. ... Songs sung at those times reflected the life and happen ings in the community; they mirrored the people's character, culture, way of thinking, beliefs, aspirations, and longings. At such times folk song reaches its fullest expression.4 Ethnomusicologists have primarily researched the rich life-cycle musical tra ditions of Sephardic Jews and the 'eidot ha-mizrah. Yet if we direct our attention to the ceremonies celebrated by Ashkenazic Jews, if the contemporary American scene is our standard, we might legitimately ask whether life-cycle song exists in any meaningful sense. The past, however, reveals a far different story, examination of which shows that Ashkenazic Jewry once developed a rich body of song associ ated with rituals of passage. This body of song was first expressed through piyyutim that, before the advent of printed prayer books, hazzanim almost certainly sang aloud in their entirety. Ezra Fleischer countered the widespread impression that early Ashke nazic synagogal poetry only gave voice, through kinot and selihot, to national tragedy, collective suffering, and personal sin. He revealed how various types of piyyut, inserted into fixed texts of the liturgy, also gave expression to praise, joy, and celebration.5 More recently, Menahem Schmelzer, in his study of a manuscript collection of Ashkenazic piyyutim, expanded on Fleischer's fresh perspective.6 Many of the piyyutim in this collection were recited in the synagogue when the bridegroom was called to the Torah on the Sabbath following his wedding (Shabbat Nisu'in), as in the early Middle Ages marriages were conducted on Fridays.7 A number of piyyu tim were also recited at circumcisions.8 di um bimbo appena nato" [Canticas de parida: Songs for the mother of a newborn child], in La nascita nella tradizione ebraica, ed.

They were associated with specific liturgical stations, such nishmat, or were grouped together as insertions in the yozer prayer, or in the Torah service when the bridegroom was called up to the Torah; see Schmelzer, "Mashehu," 33. Piyyutim of this genre are documented in the late eleventh-century Mahzor Vitry; see ibid., 35, referring to Mahzor Vitry, ed. S. Hurwitz (Nuremburg: Y. Bulka, 1923), 593, 599. Schmelzer has now analyzed MS Oxford 1099 listing similar piyyutim embodied within yozerot and reshuyyot written between the tenth and thirteenth centuries; see 306</page><page sequence="3">Mahazor Ha-Hayyim Ashkenazic life-cycle songs were primarily limited to the synagogue, in contrast to those of Sephardim and 'eidot ha-mizrah, whose conduits for life-cycle song were paraliturgical piyyutim sung in Hebrew and folk piyyutim sung in the vernacular.9 Ashkenazic synagogue life-cycle song was never eclipsed, at least not in Western and Central Europe, by the later development of folk songs in the Yiddish vernacular.10 The following study of life-cycle songs in the Ashkenazic synagogue focuses on the early modern period. By that time, a number of commonly held practices had coalesced in much of Europe, and one can trace the performance of synagogue-centered liturgical-musical customs within specific communities and regions. The piyyut component became relatively modest, largely because of the cessation of the Sabbath wedding with its special liturgy.11 What gained in importance was the Ashkenazic synagogue practice of elaborating fixed liturgi cal texts (matbe 'a ha-tefillah) by singing them to special melodies. The focus on the early modern period also reflects the availability of histori cal sources. Jewish musical traditions are overwhelmingly oral; the notation of Ashkenazic synagogue chants began sporadically only in the late eighteenth century, continuing more systematically in the mid- and late nineteenth century, particularly in Western and Central Europe. For evidence before this time, the his torian must draw on literary sources. A particularly and surprisingly useful genre is the minhag book, collections of community and synagogue customs, most of which emanated from German-speaking lands. One such minhagbuch, hitherto little exploited by musicologists, comes from seventeenth-century Worms, composed by Yiptha Yuspa Shamash (1604-78). It constitutes perhaps the most significant source for documenting West European Ashkenazic musical practices in the pre-emancipation "Piyyutim le-nisu'in le-rishonei hakhmei 'ashkenaz," in Le- 'otzikaron: mehkharim ba-shirah ha- 'ivrit uve-moreshet yisra'eil: sefer zikaron le-Aharon Mirski, ed. Efraim Hazan and Yosef Yahalom (Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan University, 2006), 173-85, esp. 175-79; 175 n. 6 lists additional MSS containing marriage-related piyyutim.

In Morocco, there was a genre of piyyutim known as ma 'alot ha-torah?an indication of the rever ence attached to them?to honor those called to the Torah on this and other special occasions; see Hayyim Zafrani, Ha-shirah ha-'ivrit be-moroko, ed.

A convenient overview is found in Ruth Rubin, Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish Folksong (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000, 1974). 11. On the Sabbath of shabbat nisu 'in, the bridegroom recited a special, festive haftarah (tt^WN WW, Isaiah 51). Eric Zimmer demonstrated that in France, and somewhat later in Austria, this haftarah fre quently took precedence over the talmudic-based prophetic readings for special Sabbaths; see Zimmer, "Keri'at haftarah likhvod hatan," in Olam ke-minhago noheig: perakim be-toledot ha-minhagim, halikho teihem ve-gilguleihem (Jerusalem: Merkaz Zalman Shazar, 1996), 273-80; Fleischer, Shirei ha-kodesh, 153,472. 307</page><page sequence="4">Geoffrey Goldberg period.12 Judah Low Kirchheim (d. 1632) also compiled a collection of Worms customs, but provided considerably less information than did Shamash with respect to musical practices.13 Yuspa Shamash's minhagbuch gives us a con venient starting point for tracing the historical development of many musical aspects. By virtue of the geographic locale of this minhag source, and that of several others, too, the following study largely reflects the musical practices of the western Germanic lands, coterminus with the liturgical (and musical) rite of minhag 'ashkenaz. From Birth to Death Birth Some four weeks following the birth of a child, as soon as the mother or yoledet regained strength following her confinement, she attended the synagogue on the Sabbath, a folk custom referred to as shabbat yezVat ha-yoledet.14 On this occasion, the child's father was called to the Torah. While a boy would already have been named at the berit milah, the day the yoledet came to the synagogue was the occasion for a girl to receive her Jewish name. In addition, both boys and girls were given a secular name on this day, an event that took place at home following the Shabbat afternoon meal, with a ceremony known as Hollekreisch. In most German communities, the attendance of the yoledet was an occasion for musical celebration. This embellishment occurred at the end of 'eil adon, the second of two poetic sections of the expanded yozer blessing recited on the Sabbath.15 Ordinarily, during the winter, to avoid lengthened services in the gen erally unheated synagogues, these piyyutim were not recited aloud, whereas in the summer, they were chanted responsively, often led by two hazzanim.16 However, 12. Yiptha Yuspa Shamash, Minhagim de-kehillah kedoshah vermaiza le-rabbi Yuspa Shamash, ed. Benjamin Salomon Hamburger and Eric Zimmer, 2 vols. (Jerusalem: Makhon Yerushalayim, 1988). Seventeenth-century Worms had the fourth-largest Jewish community in Western and Central Europe, after Prague, Frankfurt, and Vienna; see Shamash, Minhagim, introduction by Zimmer, 1:61. 13. Juda Liva Kirchheim, Minhagot vermaiza, ed. Israel Mordecai Peles (Jerusalem: Makhon Yerushalayim, 1987). 14. Shamash described the elaborate folk customs concerning confinement and its termination; Minhagim 2:256-64, section 288. Cross-cultural influences between the Jewish rite of passage for the birth mother and the Christian Ausgegang ritual have recently been examined in Elisheva Baumgarten, "Tiksei nashim: minhag 'shabbat yezi'at ha-yoledet' be-heksheiro ha-tarbuti be-reishit ha'eit ha-hadashah," in Mehkarim be-toledot yehudei ashkenaz: seifer yoveil likhvod yizhak (eric) zimmer, ed. Gershon Bacon, Daniel Sperber, and Aharon Gaimoni (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 2008), 11-28. 15. The poetic expansion of the yozer blessing comprises of three sections, starting with ha-kol yodukha. See Reuven Hammer, Or hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals (New York: Rabbinical Assembly, 2003), xxiii. 16. Shamash, Minhagim 1:37, hag. [annotation] to par. 34 (MS Warmaiza). The second hazzan would have been a lay member of the congregation. For more on the responsorial singing of ha-kol yodukaha and 'eil 'adon, see Geoffrey Goldberg, "Hazzan and Qahal: Responsive Chant in Minhag Ashkenaz," Hebrew Union College Annual 61 (1990): 211, 214-16. 308</page><page sequence="5">Mahazor Ha-Hayyim as Shamash described, on the Sabbath when the yoledet came to the synagogue, irrespective of the season, the hazzan would sing the concluding verses of 'eil 'adon, commencing at semeihim be-zeitam, to a special festive melody.17 The text depicts the heavenly bodies as animated beings rising and falling to serve their Creator's will: Dwi anK2Q dti&amp;w ojip nzrta ow Rejoicing in rising, gladly setting, They rush to obey their Creator's Will.18 At some stage in minhag 'ashkenaz, the text was personalized to refer to the rising of the yoledet from her confinement. Later historical sources attest to the widespread practice of this musical custom. For example, according to the statutes of Hamburg-Altona of 1726, the singing of this Lobgesang (Hymn of Praise) was regarded as obligatory, and required the payment of a fee to the hazzan.19 A similar stipulation, also mention ing remuneration, was included in the statutes of the Hungarian community of Mattersdorf.20 Testimony to the diffusion in Germany of this liturgical-musical custom are references in several early and mid-nineteenth-century synagogue regulations.21 While only two musical notations of semeihim be-zeitam appear to be extant, many additional melodies were certainly in use. The first notation is present in the short handbook of life-cycle melodies compiled by Wilhelm Flamm, a hazzan in Prague.22 Flamm harmonized the melody for choral rendition so that it could be fit for the sophisticated musical tastes of Prague's Jews in the 1860s. A second melody was published in 1912 in the compendium of south German hazzanut by Selig Scheuermann (1873-1935); here, the author provided the rubric beim Ausgang einer Wdchnerin (On the Coming Out of the Birth Mother).23 In both examples, the melody was set to the verse quoted earlier and to the verse cited here in example 1:24 17.

Max Grunwald, "Die Statuten der Hamburger-Altona Gemeinde von 1726," Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft fur jiidische Volkskunde 11, no. 1 (1903): 9, par. 19. For some reason, however, the song was referred to not as semeihim be-zeitam but as kara laschemesch, (God summoned the sun, whose light shone forth), a subsequent verse of the text. 20. Max Grunwald, "Mattersdorf," Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft fur Jiidische Volkskunde 26-27 (1924-26): 509. Grunwald did not provide the date of the statutes (takkanot), but by their char acter, they are unquestionably pre-emancipation. The "festive intoning" of semeihim be-zeitam was also recalled in Alfred Fiirst's reminiscence of Eisenstadt in the same region of western Hungary; see Furst, Sitten und Gebrduche: Einer Judengasse (Minhag Asch.) (Szekesfehervar: E. Singer, 1908), 52. 21. See the section on "The Emancipation and Life-Cycle Song" in this essay. 22. Wilhelm Flamm, Noten-Beilagen zum Handbuch fur Cantoren (Prague: Samuel W.

The birth of a male child was an occasion for great festivity, especially, but not exclusively, on the day of the berit milah25 In med ieval Europe, it became the norm for circumcision to take place in the synagogue following the shaharit service.26 Both Shamash and Kirchheim discussed the widespread custom of the moheil, rather than the hazzan, leading the chanting of the shaharit service.27 If the moheil were not capable of this task, he would at least lead the closing prayers, starting at la-menaze 'ah (Psalm 20).28 In Frankfurt, however, the moheil was only permitted to lead from la-menaze 'ah on.29 The tradition of the moheil leading shaharit was wide spread also in Poland, where Moses Isserles (1488-1575) mentioned the custom in his glosses to the Shulhan 'arukh.30 At the end of the introductory pesukei de-zimrah, both the moheil and the sandak were called upon to recite va-yevarekh david and shirat ha-yam 23. Selig Scheuermann, Die gottesdienstlichen Gesdnge der Israeliten fur das ganze Jahr (Frankfurt: J. Kauffmann, 1912), 21, section I/E, no. 14. 24. Scheuermann did not indicate whether the remainder of the piyyut was sung to the same melody. Flamm, however, stated that the following verse starting kara la-shemesh was recited (in free style) by the hazzan, while the third and last verse repeated the opening melody. Both melodies are of relatively recent origin and lack archaic or modal musical elements. 25. Other celebrations included the special festivity (referred to by Shamash as the zakhar) on the preceding Sabbath known as shabbat zakhar. This took place in the home after the Friday night Sabbath meal. 26. Goldberg, Jewish Passages, 45-46. 27. Shamash, Minhagim, 2:67, section 240; Kirchheim, Minhagot Vermaiza, 83. Kirchheim gives an explanation for this honor: the first letters of the Hebrew phrase mnn ^d*? ttp ^ma, "the moheil leads the service," spell the word milah (ibid., gloss to Shamash, 'n). 28. Shamash, Minhagim, 2:67, section 240. In minhag 'ashkenaz, the service began with the opening hymn, 'adon 'olam; see Mordechai Gumpil, Sefer minhagim de-kehilateinu (Furth: Hayyim Zevi Hirsch, 1767), 3, par. 7. In some communities, the moheil led from yishtabah onward; see Shamash, Minhagim, 2:47, section 240, n. 50 of Hamburger, quoting David Leib of Lida, Sod 'adoshem, section 39. 29.

Shulhan 'arukh, yoreh dei'ah, section 265, par. 11. 310</page><page sequence="7">Mahazor Ha-Hayyim responsively.31 This practice began, appropriately enough, at the verse ve-kharot 'into ha-berit (You made a covenant [of the flesh] with him [Abraham]). Shamash described how, in Worms, the moheil would chant one verse and the sandak the next, up until yishtabah. If neither could chant or follow these custom ary divisions, the hazzan or shamash would stand in their stead.32 Although Joseph Yuspa Kosman of Frankfort (d. 1758) was of the opinion that the responsorial singing of these verse by the moheil and the sandak was the custom throughout Germany (medinot 'ashkenaz)32 its strongest hold was in the south and southwestern parts of the country.34 Even in Frankfort, where, as we have noted, the hazzan led all or most of the service, the tradition became rooted in the early eighteenth century.35 In northeast Germany, including Berlin, the chanting was often led by the moheil alone, with the congregation responding. This was still the practice at a leading Orthodox synagogue in Berlin in the late 1930s.36 Responsorial chanting by the moheil and the sandak was also known in parts of Poland.37 Originally a fluidity prevailed with regard to the division of the verses,38 but a uniform practice soon coalesced, testified to first by R. Ya'ir Bacharach of Worms (1638-1702). Custom soon saw the dividing of verses at every sof pasuk (foil close) and every 'etnahta (half close).39 This standardized practice of dividing the recitation between the moheil and the sandak is reflected in 'Avodat yisra 'eil, the authoritative edition of the daily prayer book of Seligmann Baer (1825-1897; see example 2) 40 31.

Nevertheless, this was not the custom in Furth (Bavaria), where evidently only the moheil sang ve-kharot, and possibly the subsequent passages as well.

Divisions between moheil and sandak in Seligmann Baer's 'Avodat yisra 'eil (Roedelheim Verlag, 1868) The divisions were somewhat different in the northeast, in Berlin, and in western Poland, as is evident in the cantorial compendium of Abraham Baer (1834-1894; see example 3).41 Kirchheim emphasized that the moheil and sandak were to sing ve-kharot and shirat ha-yam in a beautiful melody (niggun yafeh).42 This melody replaced the regular chant pattern and, in the case of shirat ha-yam, use of the melody of the te 'amim.43 Transcriptions reveal that a number of texts in the shaharit service were singled out for special musical performance. In south and southwest Germany, a core group of texts was sung to the special berit milah melody, and included not only ve-kharot and shirat ha-yam but also shirah hadashah and zur yisra 'eil at the conclusion of the ge 'ulah prayer. In more eastern territories (but also in Hurben, Bavaria),44 this practice was expanded to include the opening hymns "adon 'olam (Eternal God) or yigdal (Praise the Living God; see example 4).45 va-yevareikh david, a phenomenon also found in all the musical transcriptions of shirat ha-yam for a berit milah. 41.

Additional portions of the pesukei de-zimrah, such as romemot 'eil (High Praises of God; Psalm 149:6)46 and halleluyah (Psalm 150),47 were sometimes added. Mizmor le-todah (A Song of Thanksgiving; Psalm 100) was also included, a custom, according to Baer, of minhag polin. Cantorial compendia from the mid nineteenth to the early twentieth century show the expansion of texts selected for special singing (see Table l):48 The differences between the musical notations in these texts are essentially only variations of a melody pattern built on a basic musical structure and similar motives. This pattern was also used for chanting the prayers of the berit milah cer emony itself, whence, it would seem, it was transferred to the shaharit service. Shamash's statement that shirah hadashah was sung to the niggun berit milah would seem to confirm this tradition.50 Even though notations of shirah hadashah reveal a more elaborate, metrical melody, incorporating new thematic material of 46. "A double-edged sword in their hand," the phrase UT2 nvETD mm in this verse was inter preted as referring to the knife used by the moheil. 47. In Frankfurt, according to Moshe Berlove, 'adon 'olam was sung to the special berit milah melody. See Berlove, "Music and Ritual Practices in the German Synagogue," Journal of Jewish Music and Liturgy 9 (1986-87): 21.

The shirah hadashah melody seems to have been especially popular. It was first transcribed in 1809 by Lob Wolf, a cantor in Berlin, whose setting is elaborate, but lacks text underlay (example 5a-b).52 51. Francis L. Cohen (1862-1934) held that this melody probably coalesced during the eight eenth century; see Cohen, "Shirah Hadashah," Jewish Encyclopedia, 11:293-94. In support of his con tention is the fact that the London version, as transcribed by Cohen, includes a recurring cadential phrase found in numerous Ashkenazic synagogue melodies of the time. See Abraham Z.

The addition of piyyutim provided textual and musical enrichment when a berit milah took place on the Sabbath.53 Shamash described these additions, largely repeating information detailed by R. Jacob 14, no. 5. The melody pattern niggun berit milah was also used in minhag 'ashkenaz for the chanting of "elohim zivita lididkha, "God, You Commanded Your Beloved," a piyyut recited following the circum cision at the ritual meal (se 'udah), which was sometimes held in the synagogue or in an adjoining room. The piyyut includes a recurring short refrain, berit 'olam. See Maier Kohn, Der Vorbeter in der Syna goge 7, no. 16; the melody of Baer, Baal T'fillah, no. 276, is merely according to the customary chant pattern of the birkat ha-mazon. 'Elohim zivita lididkha was inserted toward the end of the second bles sing of the birkat ha-mazon after rbw^ "[by the mouth of all the living] continually, forever." Shamash describes how, if two persons had carried out the berit, the moheil and a mozez, then both were honored with chanting the piyyut responsively; see Shamash, Minhagim, 2:76, section 241. 53. Shamash, Minhagim, 2:79, section 244, where he writes .ft .n (hazzan menagein); Kirch heim, Minhagot, 85. Shamash and Kirchheim both use the term menagein to differentiate between the lay precentor and the hazzan; see Shamash, Minhagim, 2:52-53; Kirchheim, Minhagot, 19. Later, in hasidic circles in Eastern Europe, ba 'al menag 'n (Yiddish) was used for a hazzan who com posed and introduced new melodies (niggunim). 317</page><page sequence="14">Geoffrey Goldberg A - zu - rei ei - moh be - ru - ei yi - roh. a - mi - tsei kho - ah_ Ei - mim ro - a - dim ve - ov - dim bevir - oh. ome - rim le - mai - kom_ t' #Jjj^.-itjjtfJ^.tt-tfikr^tir.r-t ki - so le-nas - oh ve-a - mo keru-sei ve-ris me - ha-la-lim le-zo - kheir ha - bens, hi - loh no - oh Example 6.

'Al ha-rishonim was only recited ela borately when a piyyut belonging to the category of a zulat was inserted within the ge 'ulah blessing.

Following the congregational response, DDT^X 'n (I am the Lord, your God), a short poem belonging to a group of piyyutim with the opening word 'eloheikhem was inserted.58 It begins 'eloheikhem 'ani zokher berit (Your God, indeed, am I, who remembers the covenant).59 This poem was included in JTS Library MS 8972; its chanting was referred to by Jacob Moellin, Yuspa Shamash, and the eighteenth-century minhagbuch of Fiirth, Bavaria.60 Traces of the musical per formance of this piyyut remain in a partial notation by Abraham Baer, but by that time, the hazzan only sang, in a minor mode, the concluding words.61 In eastern Germany and Central Europe, on the occasion of a Sabbath day circumcision, certain verses in the brazenly anthropomorphic 'an'im zemirot (Hymn of Glory) were sung responsively to the berit milah melody.62 This occurred in the stanza starting at pe 'eiro (alay (His glory is upon me), where, in 57.

In some regions, however, it was also recited at a Sabbath day circumcision. The opening words of the piyyut connect immediately to the verse "The children of Israel walked into the dry land [va-yabashah]" of shirat ha-yam (Exodus 15:19), while the ensuing verse, shirah hadashah shibbehu ge 'ulim, quotes the closing section of the ge ulah prayer: D^-ixa iddh: / nwTb nv The day the depths turned into dry land Your redeemed people praised You And sang a new song. The recitation of yom le-yabashah in the synagogue on the occasion of a berit milah can be easily explained. A condition for the full celebration of the first Pass over in Egypt and its subsequent observance was circumcision (Exodus 12:44 48), a requirement referred to in the following stanza of the piyyut: nann nnaa / nay crKan n^wa maw nwln rrrw : 65D^ia: nan / yyw) loaai Those who come with You with the covenant of Your seal And from the womb are circumcised for Your name's sake. Recitation of yom le-yabashah for a berit milah was mentioned first by Abraham Klausner (late fourteenth century) in his collection of Austrian customs,66 and there after, it became a custom of minhag polin rather than minhag 'ashkenaz.67 While 63.

The minhag books of Mainz, Worms, Furth, and Frankfurt include no references to the reci tation of yom le-yabashah. 320</page><page sequence="17">Mahazor Ha-Hayyim Seligmann Baer gave the impression that yom le-yabashah, in both its liturgical and life-cycle contexts, was normative in German congregations,68 a contrary opinion was given by Wolf Heidenheim (1757-1832), who published innumerable editions of German prayer books, and more recently, by Yonah Fraenkel.69 Further more, Abraham Baer inserted a liturgical-musical rubric in his Baal T'fillah, explicitly classifying recitation of yom le-yabashah for a circumcision as minhag / 70 polin. Musical settings of yom le-yabashah in various cantorial compendia are, not surprisingly, of eastern German and Central European provenance. They range from a simple one notated by Abraham Baer, in which the hazzan sang each stanza in a joyous melody in major (example 8a),71 to more elaborate pieces transcribed by Moritz Deutch (Breslau), Aron Friedmann (Berlin), and Maier Wodak (Moravia), each based on various traditional prayer modes of the Ashkenazic synagogue. Similar or recurring refrain lines in the more complex pieces, melodic elements of which were shared in common by Deutsch and Friedmann (whose version is cited here), invited congregational participation at every strophic recurrence of the closing words, shibbehu ge'ulim ("the redeemed ones sang": example 8b).72 Bar Mitzvah The emergence of the bar mitzvah ceremony was a comparatively late devel opment. It was of German origin but only coalesced and became widespread in the late Middle Ages or the early modern period.73 Despite the relatively late emergence of the ceremony, two musical tra ditions developed.

This melody was also sung on Shabbat beshalah and on the seventh day of Passover; see annotation to no. 881. However, Baer adds that "In den meisten deutschen Gemeinden fallt rwrb nv weg," which leads to the possibility that while some German (minhag 'ashkenaz) communities did recite the piyyut on that day, this was not normally the case when there was a berit milah. 12. Deutsch, Vorbeterschule, nos. 166-70; Friedmann, Schir Lisch'laumau, no. 249; Wodak, Hamnazeach, no. 312, explicitly stating that it was for a berit milah on the Sabbath, as well as other occasions. Deutsch's setting is in major, but with modulations to the minor mode; that of Friedmann also begins in major, but thereupon expands into the Adonai Malakh mode (major with lowered seventh and tenth); Wodak's setting is in the 'Ahavah Rabbah (augmented second interval between second and third tones and lowered sixth) mode. 73. Marcus, The Jewish Life Cycle, 99.

In Worms, the same melody was used for this prayer text on Simhat Torah (example 9a):75 This special ve-ya 'azor ve-yagein melody was the custom in Frankfurt as well,76 and it appears to have been restricted to western and southwestern Germany77 On every other occasion, ve-ya azor ve-yagein was chanted in a modal chant of consider able antiquity (based on High Holy Day cantillation), the same mode used in minhag 'ashkenaz for the weekday evening (ma 'ariv) service and the shema' and its blessings in the weekday morning (shaharit) service (see example 9b).78 There was further musical elaboration in Frankfurt on those Sabbaths when a bar mitzvah ceremony occurred. After the seventh 'aliyah and before the maftir portion when the boy would be called up to the Torah, the "Kaddish over the Torah" (kaddish 'al ha-torah) was recited. The hazzan sang the first part, as on a regular Sabbath,79 but to mark the distinctiveness of the day, he departed from the usual melody in the second part of the text, singing it to one of the more recent "popular melodies."80 Marriage The wedding ceremony was the pinnacle in a cycle of ritualized community festivities both preceding and following it. Perhaps because of the protracted stages involved in contracting marriage and the complexity of the rituals surround ing it, over time, there occurred more far-reaching musical changes than with berit milah. A major factor influencing these developments was the change of the day of the traditional wedding ceremony. Engagement The cycle leading to marriage began with the engagement (tena'im), known in western Ashkenazic communities as k'nas (legen), and involved a financial settlement (k'nas) incumbent should the wedding be can celled. On the Sabbath following the k 'nas, the hazzan called up the bridegroom to the Torah with a festive ya 'amod ("let [the bridegroom] arise"), and the latter made a charitable contribution.81 This special calling up "with a loud voice" 74. In Germany, this was invariably the same person, as there was no separate Torah reader. The emergence of a separate office in Eastern Europe of the ba 'al keri 'ah requires further study. 75.

An older medieval custom, in both 'ashkenaz and polin, from at least the time of the First Crusade in 1096, had been for the huppah ceremony to be conducted on Friday, even close to the onset of Shabbat, as was the case in Worms.84 In Germany, these "Sabbath wed dings" extended into the Sabbath proper. Such weddings were often known as Shabbat Breilaft, although Jacob Moellin did not use, or was unfamiliar with, this name.85 Almost all the special wedding piyyutim included in JTS Library MS 8972 were connected to the ceremonies of Shabbat Breilaft. In the early modern period, however, the day for weddings was transferred to Wednesday, as had been talmudic practice.86 In Frankfurt, Shabbat Breilaft was discontinued around the year 1660, despite a short-lived attempt in 1701 to revive it.87 In Worms, the older practice had already ceased by the time Shamash wrote down his minhagim** although he described the former practice in detail. On Saturday morning, when the bridegroom, followed by the bride, was escorted to the synagogue, a special musical elaboration occurred. In Frankfurt, the escorting was even accompanied by music played by Gentile musicians.89 In Worms, the precentor (menagein) of the pesukei de-zimrah halted the shaharit service before miyidmeh lakh, "who is like You," in the nishmat hymn, to permit the escorting of the bridegroom.90 Once the latter had been brought into the syna gogue, the precentor would sing mi yidmeh lakh with special emphasis (be-kol ram)?a personalization of the text to "who, indeed, is like you."91 84. Shamash, Minhagim 2:9-10, section 229, n. 1 of Hamburger; 52-59, section 235 (Sha mash's complete description of Shabbat Breilaft), and n. 18 of Hamburger, quoting Yoseif 'omez; Kirch heim, Minhagot, 79. The original intent of the "Sabbath wedding" was to save expenses, following the massacres of 1096 and the impoverishment of the Jews. 85.

Kirchheim mentioned the special musical emphasis; Minhagot, 80. R. Yair Hayyim Bachar ach was shocked that this had been the custom in Worms because, in other localities, the interruption occurred at "a more appropriate place," such as before barukh she 'amar?where the pesukei de-zimrah 325</page><page sequence="22">Geoffrey Goldberg There was a fairly logical reason why the break for the escorting occurred at mi yidmeh lakh: at this juncture, a piyyut opening with the same words "jV-rnitfW / lV-njp7? ^ had once been inserted. This piyyut was included in JTS Library MS 8972.92 Shamash and Kirchheim apparently did not know this particular piyyut, which, had it once been sung in Worms, had long been discon tinued. Nevertheless the escorting on Shabbat Breilaft remained, and the final section of nishmat was given musical emphasis.93 Wedding-related piyyutim inserted into the service listed by Shamash and Kirchheim, and somewhat earlier almost identically by Jacob Moellin, belonged to a smaller and different repertory. These might have represented minhag reinus (Rhineland) as against minhag oystraikh (Austria) represented by JTS Library MS 8972.94 A piyyut from both repertories was 'ataneh shevahei, sung after the bridegroom had been called up to the Torah by a special reshut (the same as that sung on Simhat Torah). The piyyut includes references to the hatan and quotes God's blessing to Adam and Eve and the commandment and hope for children (Genesis 1:28). According to Moellin, the opening stanza was sung together by the hazzan and shushvinim, his close friends also "obligated" to be called up on this occasion, indicating that the text and the melody were familiar.95 The Later Mid-Week Wedding. With the transfer of the marriage ceremony to Wednesday, the shaharit service on the day of the wedding now occasioned far less musical enrichment. The cessation of the Sabbath wedding enabled the section began?or after nishmat, just before it ended. See Shamash, Minhagim 2:53, n. 26 of Hambur ger, quoting Yair Bacharach, Mekor hayyim, section 51, par. 5; Moellin, Seifer maharil, 469, section 8, gloss n. 6. 92. Schmelzer, "Mashehu," 36-37. 93. A similar piyyut in JTS Library MS 8972 was nishmat yesharim, noted for its beauty and simplicity, although it likewise received no mention by Shamash or Kirchheim. Each stanza begins with the word nm2, and its final line concludes with the opening phrase of the second part of the nishmat hymn, WO nT^'N^tt m [Dnipix]. It makes references to marriage, the bride and groom (through biblical quotations that constitute the last line of each stanza), and friends who participate in the escorting. It was first printed in 1717 in the prayer book of R. Isaiah Horowitz (ca. 1565 1630), and might have still been sung despite discontinuation of Shabbat Breilaft. The prayer book includes the rubric that the hazzan was to sing the piyyut before nishmat. See Schmelzer, "Mashehu," 34-35; R. Isaiah Horowitz, Sha 'ar ha-shamayim (Amsterdam: Beit 'aharon di shelomo antonis, 1717), 134. 94. In Mainz and Worms, the insertion of piyyutim commenced immediately before barekhu; see Moellin, Seifer maharil, 469-70, par. 8-9; Shamash, Minhagim, 2:52-57; Kirschner, Minhagot, 80-81. In Austria and in the east, the piyyutim started at the end of nishmat; see Isaac Tyrnau, Seifer ha-minhagim, ed. Shlomo Spitzer (Jerusalem: Makhon Yerushalayim 1979), 163-65. 95. The remainder of ataneh shevahei was sung by the hazzan alone. According to Moellin, it was sung immediately after the Torah reading, but Shamash and Kirchheim say it was sung after 'ashrei; see Moellin, Seifer maharil, 470, par. 9; Davidson, N, 8967; Shamash, Minhagim, 57, section 235; Kirchheim, Minhagot, 81. In Frankfurt (and possibly elsewhere), the hazzan and his vocal assistants (meshorrerim) also sang ve-ya'azor ve-yagein nin1!! Vipa, "in a melodious singing tone," perhaps similar to, or the same as, the niggun bar mizvah; see Seider ve-hanhagah shel nisu'in, 5, par. 6. 326</page><page sequence="23">Mahazor Ha-Hayyim avoidance of rabbinic opposition to removing piyyut. Of all the piyyutim once sung on Shabbat Breilaft, by the nineteenth century, only a special 'eloheikhem inserted in the kedushah of the musaf service generally continued to be sung.96 Nevertheless, in Worms, several fixed liturgical texts in the morning service on the day of the wedding received musical embellishment. As with the berit milah, shirah hadashah, and zur yisra 'eil, the concluding sections of the ge 'ulah prayer, were sung to special melodies. Despite a lack of clarity in Shamash's description, it is clear that at least one melody was used exclusively for marriages.97 If, for some reason, the marriage ceremony took place on Thursday, even though the "supplication" was omitted, the short passage 'eil 'erekh 'appayim was sung to a "pretty melody."98 In addition, the bridegroom was called to the Torah.99 Pre-Marriage Rite: Spinholz. The Sabbath before the wedding was known as Spinholz (f Vin^D^), a rather obscure term whose etymology remains unre solved.100 Then, as now, the bridegroom was called to the Torah, although the term aufruf (calling up) is of later origin.101 Such importance was given in Mainz to the festive character of Shabbat Spinholz that up until the year 1743, kab balat shabbat was celebrated on this occasion with instrumental music (kelei zemer).102 In the ma'ariv service, in order to bring attention to the forthcoming wedding, the hazzan sang two liturgical texts to special melodies. The first was malkhutekha in the ge 'ulah prayer, following the mi khamokha response of the congregation.103 This was a popular text for cantors to embellish. For example, the Berlin hazzan Aaron Beer (1738-1821) composed a different malkhutekha 96. Seligmann Baer, 'Avodat yisra'eil, 244; Abraham Baer, Baal T'fillah, nos. 615-16. On change in Ashkenazic liturgical use of piyyut in the early modern period, see Langer, To Worship God Properly, 183. 97. According to one manuscript source, Shamash explicitly stated that "on the day of the wedding the hazzan sings shirah hadashah in the special melody for a wedding day"; see Shamash, Minhagim 2:26, section 231, gloss. Elsewhere, however, he wrote, "the hazzan sang shirah hadashah with the melody (for the bridegroom) [of the berit milah] and zur yisra 'eil with the melody for the berit milah [for the bridegroom]." The seemingly contradictory annotations within square brackets were those of a later manuscript of Shamash; see Minhagim 2:81, long additional note of Shamash to section 245. 98. Ibid., 2:28, section 23; Shamash uses the term tehinah, rather than the more familiar term tahanun. 99. Ibid., 2:28, section 231. 100. The word literally means "spinning-wood," but Marcus argues against any connection between Spinholz and Spindel (distaff, referring to the supposed spinning abilities of the bride); see Marcus, Jewish Life Cycle, 152. In Frankfurt and elsewhere, there were originally two consecutive Spinholz sabbaths; see Shamash, Minhagim 2:4, n. 25 of Hamburger, quoting Yosif 'omez (1723) of Joseph Yuspa Hahn (1570-1637), section 657. 101.

However, Hamburger points out (4, n. 28) that in one manuscript variant, Shamash does not include malkhutekha. 327</page><page sequence="24">Geoffrey Goldberg for each Sabbath of the year, although, as far as can be ascertained, none was specifically for a life-cycle event.104 On Shabbat Spinholz, the opening words yil 1X1 "imD1?^ (Your children beheld Your sovereignty) were taken out of context and personalized, with vanekha (your children) directed toward the bridal couple rather than (or in addition) to the Israe lites. Unfortunately, no musical transcriptions of this special malkhutekha appear to be extant. According to Scheuermann, it was sung to the same melody as semehim be-zeitam.105 The second text receiving emphasis was hashkiveinu, the second bles sing after the evening shema'. In Worms, this special musical treatment began two-thirds of the way through, at ki 'eil shomereinu (For God watches over us), which was also the custom in Alsace and Baden.106 In Amsterdam, while the older practice was to begin at ki 'eil shomereinu, it later became customary for cantors to compose a setting of the entire prayer in honor of the celebration, a prac tice found also in Frankfurt.107 The similarity between a melody used in Frankfurt for ki 'eil shomereinu on Hanukkah and that of a south German kallalied (bridal song) suggests that this melody might originally have been used on Shabbat Spin holz (see examples lla-b).108 The next day, almost everywhere (but not, for example, in Furth),109 the bride groom would be called to the Torah with the special ya 'amod melody at shaharit In Worms, however, the bridegroom was called up at minhah, possibly so as to be honored at a time closer to the wedding.110 At the musaf service, the hazzan sang the closing lines of the kaddish shaleim (yehei shelamah rabbah and 'oseh shalom) to a special melody referred to by Shamash as "the melody for the bridegroom and the bride" (niggun hatan ve-kallah), suggesting a well-known traditional tune.111 Following the midday se fudah (obligatory meal), the bride and bridegroom proceeded to the Braut Haus (wedding hall) or the Tantz Haus (dance hall).

If the bride had not previously been married and was a virgin, a special festivity commenced early in the morning of wedding day. This ceremony was known as the moyen CPKB), derived from May Day customs relating to courtship and fertility.113 Before the shaharit service, the bride and groom were escorted with torches and instrumental music to the may en, the location of which, in most German communities, was the entrance to the synago gue,114 though in Worms it was held in the Braut Haus.115 There, the people threw wheat (a symbol of fertility) at the bridal couple and called out to them, ^rrn ri?), "be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28).116 Then the bridegroom was escorted to the synagogue. One melody (dating from the late eighteenth century) played at the moyen was, in the following century, transferred into the synagogue when marriages were again performed there.117 This melody was known in the Judeo-Deutsch of Alsace as the kale-lid or khuppe-lied, and in Bavaria as the maan (a corruption of moyen) niggun;lls it became one of the most popular folk songs of nineteenth century German-speaking Jews. A number of transcriptions of the melody are extant, the first dating from 1832 (see example 12a). A second transcription of the mayen shows that it acquired a text in Alsatian Judeo-Deutsch and German (see example 12b).119 The Paraliturgical Song: 'Ehad yahid u-meyyuhad. Most embellishments did not survive the discontinuance of the Shabbat wedding. Nevertheless, the rab binic ideal of mezamerim 'oto, the obligation to provide song for the couple, helped to prevent the complete eclipse of festive singing.120 Consequently, the 113.

However, in the centuries prior to the emancipation, the general custom was to conduct them outside, in the courtyard of the synagogue. Synagogue weddings were reintroduced in Germany in the nineteenth century, this change being arguably less an innovation than a restoration. 118.

Rabbi Abraham David Warhman (1771-1841) of Buczacz, Galicia, in his commentary to the Shulhan 'arukh, alluded to the singing of a pizmon at this time as if it were a fairly common occurrence.121 He was quite probably alluding to a piyyut that had gained almost universal popularity and survived into modern times: 'ehadyahid u-meyyuhad by Avigdor Karo of Prague (d. 1439). Written in Hebrew, but also with a variant in Yiddish, early printings of the Hebrew piyyut, often with the heading zemer na 'eh le-hatan (A Fitting Song for a Bridegroom), were included in publications of the birkat ha-mazon for use at the MX.Eshel 'avraham to Shulhan 'arukh, Orah hayyim, Section 140:1. Strictly speaking,pizmon refers to a piyyut with a refrain, but Wahrman applied it more broadly. 331</page><page sequence="28">Geoffrey Goldberg wedding feast, the earliest dating from 15 80.122 Every indication shows, however, that ehadyahid u-meyyuhad was not sung at the wedding feast, but rather after the hatan had been called up to the Torah.123 This usually occurred on the Sabbath before the wedding, though in some places it occurred on the Sabbath after the wedding or even following the betrothal (tena 'im), while in some communities it was sung on all three occasions.124 .^W2?&gt; in) will .^xn cprf?x nio nx .rntfn God, the One and Unique, Sought by the pure in heart who seek, That God acts kindly to Israel, Halleluyah. Textually, the piyyut has no connection whatsoever with marriage, but deals, instead, with strengthening one's trust in God, observance of the 613 command ments, invoking God's blessing on Israel, and inviting anyone of the three mono theistic faiths Orw-nxu-Hirr)125 to experience the purity of Judaism's fidelity to the oneness of God. The purely theological character of the piyyut was stressed by Juspa Kosman, who considered the song one of "great praise and a testimony to the principles of the religion."126 Entry into marriage was a time for forgiveness of sins of the past and for devotion not only to one's beloved, but also to God. This factor also explains the singing at wedding celebrations of other piyyutim that had no outward connection to marriage, such as yigdal, the poetic paraphrase of the Maimonides' Thirteen Articles of Faith.127 There are many historical references to the singing of the piyyut. For example, Judah Leib Zelichover extolled the singing of 'ehad yahid for the bride groom (on shabbat k'nas, the Sabbath after the betrothal) among other customs "in these lands," the reference being to Amsterdam and the Republic of the United Provinces.128 Rabbi Joseph Juspa Kosman (d. 1758) detailed how, in Frankfurt, the Sabbath before the wedding was a time "to increase joy ... to call him [the bridegroom] to the Torah ... and sing on this behalf (u-mezamrim lo) 'ehad 122.

In post emancipation times, references to singing 'ehad yahid u-meyyuhad for the bride groom were frequently made in descriptions of traditional Jewish life in Western and Central Europe, as well as in autobiographical reminiscences.132 Remarkably, for centuries, 'ehad yahid u-meyyuhad was never printed in a standard Ashkenazic prayer book. The only siddur that appears to have eventually included it (and then only the opening stanza) was the Festival prayer book edited in 1866 by Rabbi Michael Sachs of Berlin.133 Seligmann Baer included the entire piyyut in his handbook for Torah readers published that year,134 as did Lion Wolff in his 1914 handbook for cantors.135 The first published musical transcription of the piyyut, like the text itself, emanated from Prague.136 Several notations were included in the collections of nineteenth-century hazzanim, and Idelsohn provided three versions in his Thesaurus volume of south German melodies (examples 13a-b).137 The absence of 'ehadyahid u-meyyuhad from printed siddurim underscores that it functioned as a paraliturgical text transmitted orally by hazzanim. As a result, much of the text was forgotten, especially in eastern regions of Europe.138 Even in Western Europe, just the opening stanza (or two) was generally sung.139 This process of reduction was noted by Juspa Kossman of Frankfurt, who held that all the stanzas should be sung, "unlike some hazzanim who sing only one or two."140 In Central and Eastern Europe, even the first (and only) stanza was 129.

On ordinary weekdays, this was usually a simple chant. In Frankfurt, following the death of a member of the community (older than one year of age) and burial had not yet taken place, the chanting of 'adon 'olam was omitted.143 In this way, without any formal verbal pronouncement of sad news, the community was informed of a person's death. The Emancipation and Life-Cycle Song In the early nineteenth century, there was a drive in Germany to eliminate, reduce, or at least regulate the singing of melodies associated with life-cycle events in the synagogue. Several factors contributed to this downplaying. The presentation of Judaism as a faith rather than as a way of life led to a minimization of the folk and peoplehood aspects of Jewish life. Attention to individual semahot (celebrations) was viewed as a digression from a liturgy whose purpose was to express the universal truths of Judaism. Increased sensitivity to the image of Jews and Judaism in German society influenced attitudes toward the suitability of music for divine worship; an attendant lack of formality surrounding life-cycle song and rituals offended a changed aesthetic on the part of many German Jews who sought something "more akin to ecclesiastical formality" rather than the former "more improvised expression of Jewish worship."144 Efforts to eliminate or regulate life-cycle folk customs found concrete expression in many Synagogen-Ordnungen, or synagogue regulations, drawn up by German rabbis, and were sometimes authorized by state authorities. They were introduced, mainly in the 1830s and 1840s, by Reformist-leaning rabbis and, for the most part, tended to avoid fundamental halakhic changes. Life-cycle synagogue melodies and piyyutim were brought under especially sharp scrutiny and regarded unfavorably.145 The first Synagogue Regulation issued in 1810 by the Consistory of the Kingdom of Cassel, headed by the early Reform leader Israel Jacobson, ruled that the calling up of a bridegroom should no longer be accompanied by special singing. The special singing of semeihim be-zeitam for a bridegroom or a yoledet was also no longer allowed. The Synagogue Regulation of Mittelfranken, Bavaria (1836), issued similar rules, prohibiting special singing when calling up a bar mitzvah or a bridegroom to 143. Geiger, Divrei kehillot, 13. 144.

Curtailment of piyyutim, except on High Holy Days, was generally favored. This was facilitated by "a general loss of Ashkenazic interest in piyyut"; see Langer, To Worship God Properly, 182-85. For attitudes toward piyyut by leading nineteenth-century German rabbis, see Michael A.

Semeihim be-zeitam (yoledet) was sometimes also sung for the bridegroom,151 mdmalkutekha was some times sung for a yoledet. It was also not uncommon for ehad yahid to be sung for a bar mitzvah,152 as well as for the hatan torah and hatan bereishit. The words of the texts that connected to the life-cycle ceremonies lost their specificity and became generic. By the second part of the century, there were indications of a more positive reevaluation of these practices. For example, the Regulation of Hannover of 1870 sanctioned the recital of 'ehad yahid and, on a Sabbath when there was a berit milah in the synagogue, encouraged the singing of a special piyyut.153 Further more, it permitted the special recitation of ve-kharot fimo ha-berit, suggesting the continuance of responsive singing of shirat ha-yam, as well as eloheikhem in the kedushah of musaf154 Examination of the publications of several cantor-composers shows that some degree of life-cycle song in the synagogue not only was retained, but even was sometimes presented in more stylized forms. Three leading nineteenth-century com posers of synagogue music, Louis Lewandowski (1823-94), Salomon Sulzer (1804-90), and Samuel Naumbourg (1815-80), composed choral settings for the 146.

On the other hand, the gifted and eclectic cantor-composer Hirsch Weintraub (1811-81) of Konigsberg wrote new melodies specifically for life-cycle cer emonies. These were published in his Schire Beth Adonai (1859) and included choral settings for berit milah, bar mitzvah, the new ceremony of confirmation, and weddings. For the Sabbath preceding marriage and for a bar mitzvah, he com posed a new setting of 'ehad yahid u-meyyuhad (examples 14-15).158 The second of these pieces is of particular interest because the text has been modified. Only the three opening words have been retained, and, most notably, the word *7N, has been omitted. The text now reads, 158.

Without question, "the one and unique" refers directly to the bar mitzvah or the bridegroom, before whom "a new song was sung." Weintraub's setting of 'ehad yahid provides concrete evidence for the personalization of liturgical texts for use at mahazor ha-hayyim celebrations, a customary practice that has been docu mented throughout this article. Conclusion The revival of synagogal life-cycle song by Hirsch Weintraub was short lived. It represented the endpoint of many centuries of liturgical and musical crea tivity in this genre within the European Ashkenazic synagogue. Yet the need to respond to the spiritual needs of the individual within the larger communal context continues. In many contemporary American synagogues, the prayer on behalf of the sick (mi-sheberakh) is no longer hurried through in an undertone, but is often sung to new musical settings, often by the entire congregation, extend ing for several minutes.159 This American practice seems to be responding to deeply felt personal needs not adequately met in the past. It has become?in addition to the singing of siman tov u-mazal tov?a peak individual "life-cycle" moment supported by the community. Yet the rich development of life-cycle song in the European Ashkenazic synagogue shows that innovations were not pri marily for life's woes, but for life's celebrations.
