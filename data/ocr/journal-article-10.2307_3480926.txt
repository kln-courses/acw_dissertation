<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deterring Environmental Crime Through Flexible Sentencing: A Proposal for the New Organizational Environmental Sentencing Guidelines Jason M. Lemkint The United States Sentencing Commission is currently considering guidelines for criminal sentences in environmental crimes committed by organizations (such as corporations). Proposed guidelines submitted in 1993 by the Commission's Advisory Group on Environmental Sanctions would subject organizations convicted of environmental crimes to pen- alties hasher then those imposed for other organizational crimes, and would strictly limited the extent to which those penalties could be re- duced for organization with environmental compliance programs in place. This Comment argues that the Advisory Group's proposals are excessively punitive, going beyond the level of severity at which deter- rence would be optimally efficient. This Comment therefore advocates for organizational environmental sentencing that provide for wider penalty ranges and afford greater opportunity for convicted organiza- tion to mitigate their fines by maintaining strong compliance programs.

Sentencing guidelines could play a major role in deterring noncompli- ance with these laws by establishing consistently severe punishments for environmental crimes. Congress has approved guidelines for organiza- tional crime in general," and in the near future the United States Sentencing Commission (the "Commission") will adopt and submit sentencing guidelines for organizational environmental crimes.6 In the area of non-environmental organizational crimes, guidelines have in fact led many businesses to revisit, or even consider for the first time, their policies on white-collar law violations.7 The debate over what these environmental crime-sentencing guide- lines should be has been distorted: rather than focusing on preventing environmental crime through deterrence, many academics, as well as the Commission's Advisory Group on Environmental Sanctions (the 2. As Professor Abraham S. Goldstein notes, the very term "white-collar crime" "evokes a highly emotive image of great corporations and those who run them making all of us their victims- overcharging us for our purchases, polluting our environment, and making us less safe so that they may make more money." Abraham S. Goldstein, White-Collar Crime and Civil Sanctions, 101 YALE L.J. 1895, 1898 (1992). A 1985 Department of Justice survey indicated that sixty-five percent of Americans view sentences for white-collar crimes as too lenient. Ilene H. Nagel &amp; Winthrop M.

The Advisory Group expressed its retributive focus in 1993 by proposing sentencing guidelines specifically tailored for organizational environmental crime that are stricter than the sentencing guidelines for organizational crime in general.8 This Comment argues that the Com- mission's focus is misplaced, and that the goal of any sentencing scheme should be deterrence, not retribution. It will further argue that the rigid provisions of the Commission's Proposed Guidelines cannot achieve effective deterrence of organizational environmental crime. This Comment proposes, in place of the current Proposed Guidelines, flexible guidelines that will allow courts to set penalties to achieve the required level of deterrence in each case. On the whole, this Comment maintains that organizational envi- ronmental crime should be treated like other forms of white-collar crime. Of course, corporate defendants should be punished as the law requires. However, they should not be "overdeterred" by a retributive desire to lash out at environmental polluters who are viewed by some as the "Mafia" of the economic world.9 On the other hand, due to the variety of types and perpetrators of environmental crime, the lack of sentencing precedents for environ- mental crimes, the substantial penalties already existing under federal environmental statutes, and the fact that scienter and culpability are sig- nificant in the environmental realm, the new Environmental Guidelines should take a flexible approach toward fine calculation. They should also allow greater judicial discretion in the determination of the size of the criminal fine and the standards for mitigation. The Proposed Guidelines, if they had been enacted, would have done just the opposite. By imposing excessively rigid and inflexible requirements on compliance programs, the Proposed Guidelines would have created unpredictability and discouraged compliance programs. By combining excessively harsh fines with extremely limited mitigation opportunities, the Proposed Guidelines also would have discouraged good-faith efforts to avoid environmental crimes. They would have im- posed fines for environmental crimes higher than those imposed for most other federal crimes, and would in many cases have provided little fine mitigation for crimes committed without criminal intent. The Pro- posed Guidelines also would have capped aggregate fine mitigation at 8. Draft Corporate Sentencing Guildelines for Environmental Violations, reprinted in 24 ENv'Tr REP.

A new Sentencing Commission is now in place. Therefore, it is time to revisit the issue of organizational environmental sentencing guidelines with a fuller perspective. The Commission is currently con- sidering adopting Environmental Guidelines that incorporate many of the flaws of the earlier Proposed Guidelines. This Comment will argue that the Proposed Guidelines' approach should be substantially modi- fied and replaced with more flexible regulations that will encourage compliance and achieve effective environmental protection. Part I of this Comment describes what environmental crime is. Part II details the history of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the po- litical battles surrounding the Proposed Guidelines. This history will aid understanding of the current state of sentencing guidelines and will demonstrate the strong likelihood that Environmental Guidelines will be adopted in some form soon. Part III surveys the provisions of the Pro- posed Guidelines that appear likely to resurface in the final Environ- mental Guidelines. Part IV critiques these provisions. Part V proposes a more flexible set of guidelines for organizational environmental crimes based on an economic deterrence model. Appendix A provides a prac- tical look at how corporations should prepare for the adoption of the Environmental Guidelines. Appendix B examines how environmental crimes would be sentenced under both the Proposed Guidelines and the Organizational Guidelines.

II THE HISTORY OF SENTENCING GUIDELINES FOR ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES In 1984 Congress created the Federal Sentencing Commission,33 a permanent body of seven individuals authorized to promulgate sen- tencing guidelines.34 Congress created the Commission to address the unpredictability and excessive judicial discretion Congress saw plaguing federal sentencing.35 As President Clinton recently put it, "the federal government adopted these sentencing guidelines to [address] the feeling a lot of Americans had that the sentence a person got and the time a person did was totally arbitrary, that it varied so dramatically from judge to judge and state to state that it was hard to believe justice was ever be- ing done."36 To make its guidelines law, the Sentencing Commission must first approve a draft of its proposed guidelines and forward the draft to Con- gress. Congress then has six months to review the Commission's pro- posal. Absent any action by Congress, the proposed guidelines take effect automatically once the review period expires."37 33. The Sentencing Commission is an independent agency of the federal judiciary charged with developing guidelines for sentencing individuals and organizations convicted of federal crimes. 28 U.S.C. ? 994 (1994). 34. 28 U.S.C. ? 991 (1994); Jed S.

Before the adoption of the Guidelines, "[t]he exercise of [judicial discretion] was largely unreviewable, since appeals were permitted in only limited circumstances and were rarely successful when taken." Rakoff, supra note 34, ? 1.03[2], at 1-10. The evidence is still unclear regarding the success or failure of the guidelines at reducing sentencing disparity. Two reports on the guidelines for individuals, one by the GAO and the other by the Sentencing Commission, yielded inconclusive results that indicate only that disparity may have been reduced under the guidelines.

To obtain feedback, the Commission published and requested comment on three major drafts of the Organizational Guidelines before adopting them in their current form.41 The Commission admitted that, among its members, "there was no consensus as to a single theory of organizational sentencing."42 One shared goal, however, was punitive deterrence.43 The Organizational Guidelines in many instances overrode the more limited penalties imposed by pre-existing federal organizational criminal laws.44 They left judges with substantially more sentencing dis- cretion than the guidelines for individuals did, but they also greatly in- creased the potential sanctions for corporate crimes.45 Under the Organizational Guidelines, a judge may impose penalties such as fines in the tens of millions of dollars, mandatory restitution and corporate probation, and even a sentence of "death"-that is, fines high enough to divest the company of all assets.46 The Organizational Guidelines' four guiding principles are to re- quire a corporation to make restitution for the damage caused by its 38.

The Commission postponed its decision because it felt that environmental crimes might be unique for four reasons: (1) the potential difficulty in measuring losses; (2) the scienter issue; (3) the fact that environmental violations are subject to such a large number of overlapping enforcement schemes and criminal sanctions; and (4) division of opinion over how to balance concerns for the environment with concerns for corporate effectiveness.

In July of 1994, the Commission considered the En- vironmental Guidelines a "priority," development of which was to proceed "deliberately" pending the appointment of a full slate of Commissioners.66 Nevertheless, the new Commission did not list the En- vironmental Guidelines among its top priorities in October 1994.67 Although the Commission chose not to adopt the Proposed Guide- lines in 1994, Commissioners continue to refer to them in their discus- sions of proposals for new Environmental Guidelines.68 Some form of Environmental Guidelines will very likely be adopted in November of 1996 or in November of 1997, and the Commission will publish a draft of the Environmental Guidelines in advance of those dates to allow for public comment.69 In theory, the Commission could adopt a set of Environmental Guidelines radically different from both the Proposed Guidelines and the Organizational Guidelines. It is more likely, however, that the Sen- tencing Commission will adopt Environmental Guidelines based on a modified version of the Organizational Guidelines for nonenvironmetal crimes set out in Chapter Eight of the federal sentencing guidelines. At least two of the Commissioners want to craft the Environmental Guide- lines out of Chapter Eight.70 They feel that because attorneys and 65.

Although the Commission has not rejected the Proposed Guide- lines, it is extremely unlikely to adopt the Proposed Guidelines in their current form, since neither prosecutors nor corporate counsels support them."75 Prosecutors see them as too cumbersome and complicated, and industry sees them as too favorable to prosecutors.'76 However, the Commission is likely to adopt Environmental Guidelines containing key provisions very similar to some of those set out in the Proposed Guide- lines."77 The Environmental Guidelines are likely to retain three particu- lar features of the Proposed Guidelines: a strict, detailed compliance program, a fine table that radically increases the fines for environmental crimes, and a "collar" provision78 that caps mitigation credit.79 This Comment takes a two-pronged approach in evaluating the En- vironmental Guidelines. First, it critiques the three features of the Pro- posed Guidelines that will probably resurface in similar form in the final Environmental Guidelines. Second, it sets out discrete policy proposals detailing how and where the existing Organizational Guidelines should be modified to take into account the unique characteristics and hetero- geneity of environmental crimes. This Comment's proposed modifica- tions to Chapter Eight move away from the Proposed Guidelines' focus on retribution and overdeterrence and emphasize instead rational eco- nomic deterrence. 71.

The first section, Part A, defines key terms and the chapter's ap- plicability to organizations for environmental criminal violations.80s The Proposed Guidelines define criminal "counts" as "any punishable in- stances of violation, including days of violation."8' Thus, each day of a violation increases the criminal fine imposed upon an organization. "Organization" is defined broadly to include corporations, partner- ships, unions, trusts, pension funds, governments, and non-profit organi- zations.82 Part B is used to determine the initial size of the criminal fine.83 Section 9Bl1.1, which mirrors the so-called "Death Penalty" in section 8C1.1 of the general Organizational Guidelines, provides that a court shall set a fine at an amount "sufficient to divest the organization of all its net assets" if the organization operated primarily for a criminal pur- pose or primarily by criminal means. Such a fine may not be greater than the statutory maximum, however.84 Part B then sets out how the Primary Offe..oe Level of one to twenty-four (or higher) is calculated for organizations other than "criminal purpose organizations." The fine in a particular case is based on a sliding scale percentage of the maximum statutory fine."5 The higher the offense level, the greater the percentage. An offense level of fourteen, for example, leads to a fine that is forty to sixty per- cent of the statutory maximum; an offense level of twenty-four or more 80. Proposed Guidelines, supra note 8, ? 9A1, at 1378. 81. Id. ? 9A1.2, Application Note 2(a), at 1378. This definition of "counts" does not appear in the general Organizational Guidelines. U.S.S.G., supra note 41, ? 8A1.2, at 339. However, it is similar to the one employed under a number of federal environmental statutes. See, e.g., Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. ? 1319(c) (1994) (setting out criminal penalties for violations, either in the form of imprisonment or fines per day of violation). 82.

By contrast, the Organizational Guidelines set out the base fine as being the greatest of (1) the amount from a table set out in ? 8C2.4(d) ranging from $5,000 to $72,500,000; (2) "the pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense"; or (3) "the pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to the extent the loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly." U.S.S.G., supra note 41, ? 8C2.4(a), at 348. Significantly, and in contrast to the Proposed Guidelines, losses that were caused negligently or without fault do not go into this method of calculating the base fine.

Second, the base penalty is increased if the organization has a past history of viola- tion.9' Third, if the organization has no bona fide compliance program or other organized effort to achieve and maintain compliance with envi- ronmental requirements, the penalty is further increased by four levels.92 The second half of Part C sets out three possible mitigating fac- tors: "Commitment to Environmental Compliance," "Cooperation and Self-reporting," and "Remedial Assistance.""'93 Commitment to envi- 86.

Line managers are to "routinely review environmental monitoring and auditing reports, direct the resolution of identified compliance issues, and ensure application of the resources and mechanisms necessary to carry out a substantial commitment."''l Factor 2: "Integration of Environmental Policies, Standards and Pro- cedures."'02 To meet this factor, the organization must have "adopted, and communicated to its employees and agents, policies, standards and 94.

The ABA's General Principles of Sentencing Discretion state that [t]he sentence imposed should be no more severe than necessary to achieve the societal purpose or purposes for which it is authorized. The sentence imposed in each case should be the minimum sanction that is consistent with the gravity of the of- fense, the culpability of the offender, the offender's criminal history, and [his] personal characteristics.... 146 This Comment argues below that the Proposed Guidelines are more severe than necessary to achieve environmental regulatory compliance, and that they set out punishments that often exceed the minimum sanc- tion consistent with the gravity of the offense. This Comment also demonstrates that the Proposed Guidelines are too inflexible to accourrnt for the heterogeneity of environmental crimes, ignore the culpability of the defendant, and slight organizational actions that should lead to sub- stantial fine mitigation. The introductory Commentary to Chapter Eight-the chapter that covers sentencing of organizations for all non-environmental felonies and class A misdemeanors-sets out four guiding principles for organ- izational criminal punishment:'47 First, the court must, whenever practicable, order the organiza- tion to remedy any harm caused by the offense .... Second, if the organization operated primarily for a criminal pur- pose.., the fine should be set sufficiently high to divest the or- ganization of all its assets. Third, the fine range. . . should be based on the seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the organization ... ,14 Fourth, probation is an appropriate sen- tence for an organizational defendant [if it will] ensure that an- other sanction will be fully implemented [or] that steps will be 145.

Culpability is generally determined by the steps taken by the organization prior to the offense to prevent and detect criminal conduct, by the level and extent of involvement in or tolerance of the offense by certain personnel, and by the organization's actions after the offense has been committed.

The respective sections on Criminal Purpose Organiza- tions'" and Probation'15 are essentially the same in both the Proposed Guidelines and the Organizational Guidelines. The Proposed Guide- lines fail to heed the Organizational Guidelines' guiding principles, however, by setting out fine ranges that are incommensurate with the gravity of many offenses and the culpability of many organizational defendants. The Proposed Guidelines fail to meet the sentencing stan- dards of both the ABA and Chapter Eight by imposing excessive penal- ties, unnecessarily restricting mitigation credit, not addressing important issues of scienter and culpability, and ignoring substantial differences among organizations and among the environmental crimes they com- mit. A. The Flawed Rationale for Higher Fines The Sentencing Guidelines were intended only to limit the number of subcategories of offenses, and not to create new and greater punish- ments.152 However, the Proposed Guidelines' fine ranges would do just that in many cases. The Sentencing Guidelines' goal of reducing sen- tencing disparity hinges on the notion that a past history of sentences will reveal a generally acceptable sentencing range.'53 Punishment for environmental crimes, however, is relatively new. According to DOJ, only forty defendants were indicted for environmental crimes in 1983.154 Thus, environmental crimes, especially organizational ones, lack the "experience baseline" found in other crimes to which sen- tencing guidelines have been applied.'55 149.

An argument about the suitability of organizational probation in general is beyond the scope of this Comment. This Comment agrees that some form of organizational probation is a desirable or at least inevitable part of the Environmental Guidelines. This Comment focuses, however, on the flaws in how the Proposed Guidelines mete out probation for organizational environmental crimes.

Rather than setting out a "heartland," the Proposed Guidelines simply set out rules that would substantially increase sentences without referring to any precedential baseline. This is not to say that the task of crafting Environmental Guidelines is impossible. However, if the Commission cannot base its sentencing ranges on a "heartland" (which does not yet exist), it must choose some other justification for its adoption of sentencing ranges that lead to fines greater than those meted out for most other corporate crimes. The Proposed Guidelines advocate fines that are often close to the statutory maximum and that are generally higher than those calculated using the existing organizational sentencing guidelines.'58 One com- mentator has noted that "the proposal's provisions on multiple offenses are clearly harsher than [those] for individual and corporate sentenc- ing."'159 Consider the example of a two-week-long, negligent, unper- mitted pollutant discharge under section 301 of the Clean Water Act.'" The Proposed Guidelines set out a minimum offense level of fourteen for such a crime.161 The fine under Chapter Eight for a level fourteen CAA and CWA. More criminal prosecutions became possible when Congress enacted RCRA and CERCLA in the early 1980s. The vast amount of empirical data on nonenvironmental crimes helped the Commission "resolve its philosophical dilemma" over whether to give defendants their "just deserts" or to focus on "crime control," since the Commission could defer to judges and legislators who have made these distinctions "over the course of time." U.S.S.G., supra note 41, ? 1A(3), at 3-4. However, organizational environmental crimes lack such an experience baseline.

The maximum fine under the RCRA is $50,000 per day per violation.'64 The Proposed Guidelines set out a base level of fourteen for such an offense.165 Under Chapter Eight, the fine again would be $85,000. Under the Proposed Guidelines, the fine for level fourteen violations would be forty to sixty percent of $700,000, or $280,000 to $420,000. There are valid reasons to punish environmental crimes differently from non-environmental ones. Environmental crimes are distinctive in that harm often increases with the duration of the crime's perpetration. In such cases, the criminal fine arguably should be increased incremen- tally with the increase in harm. This aspect of environmental crime points towards allowing a prudent amount of count-stacking in the En- vironmental Guidelines.166 For this reason, the Proposed Guidelines state that in cases involving multiple counts-the usual case with environ- mental violations-the fines computed for each count will be added to determine a firm's total fine.167 The tendency of environmental harm to escalate with each envi- ronmental violation is not, however, a sufficient reason to base the daily per count fine on the statutory maximum. Doing so would destroy the wide latitude Congress granted the courts in the criminal-fine provisions of environmental statutes. In section 301 of the Clean Water Act, for example, Congress explicitly endorses count-stacking by fining defen- dants on a per-day-per-violation basis, but counters the possible exces- sive effects of compounding counts by setting out a fine range that stretches from $2,500 per-day-per-violation all the way up to $25,000 per-day-per-violation.'68 By basing fines at or near the maximum statutory levels, the Proposed Guidelines would have required courts to impose fines up to ten times as high as the lowest levels the statute gave 162. This calculation of the fine assumes that the levels under the Proposed Guidelines and the Organizational Guidelines are comparable. Given that the Proposed Guidelines have not been adopted, however, it is impossible to say whether the levels would in fact be comparable. 163. 33 U.S.C. ? 1319(c) (1994); Proposed Guidelines, supra note 8, ? 9El.l, at 1384. 164. 42 U.S.C. ? 6928(d) (1988). 165.

Such count-stacking concerns were the issue that, according to one Advisory Group member, "consumed much of the panel's time and probably produced the most divisive debates."''69 Concededly, not all fines would be higher under the Proposed Guidelines. Simple, one-count, one-day violations of high-base-level offenses could be fined a somewhat higher amount under the Organiza- tional Guidelines. It is most likely a rare environmental criminal who commits a one-count, one-day offense, however. Real world, multiple-count, multiple-day environmental crimes would be punished far more severely under the Proposed Guidelines than under the existing Organizational Guidelines in Chapter Eight. Such a result would be acceptable if the statutes called for such a harsh approach, if the Commission's mandate included increasing the severity of criminal punishment, or if an experience baseline indicated that judges on average handed down higher sentencing than would be cal- culated under Chapter Eight. However, none of these circumstances exists. As its dissenting members note, the Advisory Group has articu- lated "no basis for predicating the fine on the statutory maximum and no basis for this difference.'"70 The Advisory Group provided no em- pirical basis for its determination of percentages of maximum statutory fines, despite the fact that the law establishing the Commission requires the Commission to consider historical information when setting guide- lines."'7 Congress certainly intended environmental crimes to be pun- ished on a per-day, per-violation basis. There is no indication, however, that Congress intended that such an approach to punishment be com- bined with rigid, strict guidelines that would produce substantially higher fines than are meted out for all other organizational crimes. In- deed, according to one Advisory Group member, the Proposed Guide- lines were never supposed to create harsher fines for environmental crimes than other corporate crimes.172 This is not to say that environmental criminal fines should be re- duced from their current levels. As one Advisory Group member notes, the Sentencing Commission would be sending the wrong message to potential offenders if it allowed organizations convicted of felonies to escape serious sanction."73 Furthermore, given that there is no baseline for dealing with environmental sanctions, basing the Environmental Guidelines on, say, the statutory minimum fines would be just as groundless and arbitrary as the Proposed Guidelines' approach. 169.

Since a "heartland" has not yet been estab- lished for organizational environmental crime, judges must be afforded the latitude to find it. This Comment argues that this latitude can best be achieved by doubling the size of the fine ranges set out in the Pro- posed Guidelines. This doubling would not be inconsistent with the Guidelines' goal of reducing disparities among sentences, because that goal was never intended to eliminate all judicial discretion from the sentencing process.174 Even the Proposed Guidelines, rigid as they are, provide for some discretion in setting fines."'75 Congress recognized the need for flexibil- ity when it provided broad fine ranges in environmental statutes and when it provided for significant prosecutorial discretion for environ- mental crimes.'76 Because environmental crime encompasses a vast ar- ray of offenses and perpetrators, more discretion both up and down the fine ranges is necessary. This is not to say that a "heartland" can never be located for environmental crimes. Rather, this Comment suggests that the only way a "heartland" will be located is by allowing courts enough discretion to find it. Under the Proposed Guidelines' approach, courts would be forced to impose fines that are arbitrarily based on maximum sentences, rather than on the precedential background of sentences already imposed. B. The Proposed Guidelines' Misguided Restrictions on Mitigation The Proposed Guidelines' greatest flaw-which, according to one member of the Advisory Group, appears likely to be replicated in the Environmental Guidelines'77-is the restriction of mitigation to fifty- percent of the statutory offense level.178 This rigid cap stands in stark contrast to the Organization Guidelines, where a ninety-five percent re- 174.

To qualify for any fine mitigation under the Proposed Guidelines, a defendant would have to prove the existence of all seven of the mitigating factors laid out above.'8s The Advisory Group's goal in crafting such strict re- quirements was to assure adequate deterrence. This goal is buttressed by the collar provision, which specifies "a floor below which the fine cannot be further reduced as the result of mitigating factors."'"' Setting out explicit requirements for compliance programs is desir- able. Organizations should be encouraged to strive for a model pro- gram. Loosely defined compliance criteria are nothing more than a series of loopholes for lawyers to take advantage of. In that respect, criteria without teeth can be worse than no criteria at all. However, the Proposed Guidelines' approach is far too rigid. The combination of the fifty-percent mitigation cap and the burden of proving the existence of all seven factors may lead corporations to question whether a qualifying compliance program is more costly than the risk of a fine. Stephen Ramsey, Vice President in charge of corpo- rate environmental programs at General Electric, argues that the fifty- percent floor would "make environmental managers feel that nothing they could ever do would be enough."'"2 One Advisory Committee member has conceded that the fifty-percent cap would necessarily limit incentives to comply with environmental laws.'"3 Limiting incentives to comply promotes punishment at the expense of deterrence. If the guidelines ultimately adopted fail to promote compliance, they will evis- cerate the primary goal of having organizational environmental sen- tencing guidelines in the first place. The rigidity of the seven-factor mitigation test is also troublesome. Under the Proposed Guidelines, for instance, if high-level personnel in the organization "participated in, condoned, or [were] willfully ignorant of the offense," there exists a rebuttable presumption that the organiza- tion has not sufficiently committed itself to achieving and maintaining compliance.'84 As the former chief of the Environmental Crimes Sec- tion of the DOJ's Environment and Natural Resources Division has 179.

It permits companies to achieve compliance via means alternate or superior to those specified in the Proposed Guidelines, while simultaneously checking these programs through a court's discretion in determining whether a given program is sufficiently diligent. A sensible sentencing scheme for environmental crimes would preserve the flexibility of the Organizational Guidelines' approach and address the leniency of that approach by mandating effective in-house attention to compliance. C. The Proposed Guidelines' Failure to Account for the Size of Convicted Organizations Commentators criticized the March draft of the Proposed Guide- lines for not taking into account the varying sizes of corporate envi- ronmental defendants.'"87 Some expressed concern that big companies would be able to shrug off fines more easily than smaller companies.'"88 Other commentators-the "optimal penalty" proponents-argued that since the loss caused by environmental crime is the same regardless of the size of the corporate defendant, the punishment should be uniform for companies of all sizes. The optimal penalty approach makes sense from a restitutionary standpoint. However, since the principal goal of the Environmental Guidelines should be deterrence, fines should be crafted that can effectively deter both large and small organizations. Such deterrence can only be achieved by varying fines and stan- dards for compliance based on the organization's size and resources. Environmental statutes for the most part do not explicitly take account of an organization's size and resources,189 although their vast fine ranges implicitly call for consideration of such factors.

The Proposed Guidelines do address size in the seven mitigation factors, but they do so in a way that improperly discriminates against smaller organizations and discourages their efforts at compliance. The Organizational Guidelines address the problem of disparate impact on small companies by not requiring compliance programs to adhere to any rigid formula. As will be discussed below, they set out seven general indicia of an adequate program, but allow organizations that create adequate alternative programs to qualify for fine mitigation of up to 95 percent."'9 Modifying the Proposed Guidelines to be more like the Organizational Guidelines in this respect would diminish the disparate impact that sentencing guidelines can have on smaller compa- nies, and help them to achieve meaningful compliance. The Advisory Committee maintains that "[s]mall organizations should demonstrate the same degree of commitment to environmental compliance as larger ones, although generally with less formality and less dedicated resources (if any) than would be expected of larger or- ganizations."'lg92 Despite this gesture towards flexibility, the Proposed Guidelines require small corporations to meet all seven of the mitigation criteria. Though the Proposed Guidelines' comments suggest that "in a very small business, the manager or proprietor.., might perform rou- tine audits with a simple checklist, train employees through informal staff meetings, and perform compliance monitoring through daily 'walk-arounds' or continuous observation while managing the busi- ness,"'93 Small businesses in many cases will not be able to afford the costs of implementing such a rigid program. Moreover, as an initial matter, small, unsophisticated organizations would probably be ignorant of the Proposed Guidelines' extensive, complex mitigation criteria. It is also unrealistic to expect that small businesses would be able to "provid[e] documentation, as of the time of the offense, pertaining to the [mitigating] factors"'94 or to "document the training and evaluation, of all employees.., as to the applicable environmental requirements, policies, standards... and procedures."'95 Small organizations are more likely to enact small-scale compliance programs (which are no less well-intentioned for being modest) which, due to the company's igno- 190. 18 U.S.C. ? 3572(a)(8) (1994). 191.

However, if better compliance is to be obtained, small businesses need to be granted more flexibility in the types of compliance programs they can adopt and still be eligible for mitigation. This flexibility is especially important given the lower standards of scienter in many environmental crimes. Under the Proposed Guidelines, small companies often would be unable to qualify for compliance credit because company officials are frequently involved in the offenses smaller organizations commit.197 Due to the lack of sophistication of many small companies, however, management often may not know it is committing an offense. Because environmental crime can involve peo- ple who are "innocent" in terms of mens rea, smaller companies should be encouraged to engage in environmental compliance. Slapping them with large fines intended for large corporations will either discourage their compliance or put them out of business altogether. Neither result prevents environmental harm. The Organizational Guidelines mandate probation for organiza- tions lacking effective compliance programs only where the organiza- tion has fifty or more employees.'"98 The Proposed Guidelines, by contrast, require probation for all organizations without effective pro- grams, regardless of their size.'" Compliance is especially important in the environmental realm. The fact that a small, start-up organization lacks a fully effective compliance program, however, should not be viewed as a de facto indication of such wanton criminal intent that the organization merits mandatory probation under all circumstances. Smaller organizations need more flexibility. The Environmental Guidelines should specify that probation is generally, but not necessar- ily, appropriate for organizations of fifty employees or less that lack effective compliance programs. Such organizations should be allowed to avoid probation where they can demonstrate that their size and lack of resources make implementing a compliance program impossible. 196. See William E.

The Proposed Guidelines' Failure to Account for Scienter In contrast to most other areas of criminal law, an organization can be convicted under many environmental statutes on a showing of negli- gence, or even on a strict liability theory.203 Under the Refuse Act,204 for example, it is a crime to discharge refuse into navigable waters without a permit, regardless of the perpetrator's intent.205 Under the Clean Water Act, it is a crime to discharge a pollutant negligently from a point source without a permit.206 Under the RCRA,27 it is a crime to "transport hazardous waste to an unpermitted treatment facility," "regardless of the transporter's mental state with respect to the treat- ment facility's permit status."208 Strict liability sentencing for environmental crimes is justified by analogy to the harm caused by public welfare offenses.2" Even though this analogy makes sense for determining guilt, scienter should never- 200.

While the base fine scheme in the Proposed Guidelines imposes the heaviest base offense level for knowing endangerment resulting from mishandling hazardous or toxic substances, pesticides, or other pollutants,210 the scheme does not otherwise account for gradations in scienter.211 Concededly, prosecutors may take into account the presence or lack of scienter when they decide on which counts to indict an organi- zation.212 Even if they do, however, it is neither fair nor efficient in terms of deterrence to punish in the same way an organization that did not intend to commit a crime as one that did. Providing broader fine ranges would promote deterrence, as would an explicit policy statement allowing fine mitigation for organizations lacking criminal intent. The Proposed Guidelines also fail to differentiate between cases where an employee has broken the law in spite of an adequate company compliance policy, and cases where management implicitly or explicitly endorses commission of an environmental offense. The Organizational Guidelines, by contrast, state that "[i]f no individual within substantial authority personnel participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense; the organization at the time of the offense had an effec- tive program to prevent and detect violations of law; and the base fine is [not determined by computing 'the pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense'], a downward departure may be warranted."213 A similar policy statement should be included in the Environmental Guidelines. The Organizational Guidelines deny culpability deductions where high-level personnel condone or participate in the offense, but grant such deductions where senior personnel have not been involved.214 They set out a series of aggravating factors based on scienter, which 210.

With regard to the Organizational Guidelines, the Commission concluded that an organization's culpability should sig- nificantly impact its sentence.216 The Environmental Guidelines should, like the Organizational Guidelines, allow for fine reduction where an organization does not exhibit criminal intent and for fine escalation in cases of reckless or intentional misconduct. Mitigation should generally be permitted for negligent and strict liability defendants that made dili- gent efforts towards compliance prior to committing their offenses. E. The Commission's Mistaken Interpretation of its Congressional Mandate The Proposed Guidelines not only fail to promote efficient deter- rence and fairness, but if enacted they would exceed the Commission's Congressional mandate. Congress has only conferred on the Commis- sion a general duty to "establish sentencing policies and practices for the Federal criminal justice system.""'217 The original Sentencing Guide- lines for individuals were an outgrowth of the Congressional mandate to eliminate unwarranted disparities in jail terms for similarly situated con- victs. The Organizational Guidelines depart from this mandate: they only address disparities in fine determination, not in jail terms, and they are not based on empirical data regarding patterns of corporate convic- tions and sentences.2" Such empirical data are not yet available-a gap which led one commentator to call the Proposed Guidelines a "solution in search of a problem."2"9 Congress did not ask the Commission to retool the laws of envi- ronmental enforcement.220 With this in mind, the Commission must look 215.

As a policy matter it is troubling that the Advisory Group transformed environmental crimes into mandatory minimum violations without any charge from Congress to the Commission to rewrite</page><page sequence="34">340 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:307 beyond its ideology and focus on encouraging deterrence and narrow- ing inequitable sentencing disparity. The Commission should not set the guidelines based on maximum fines. To do so without evidence of disparity from a sentencing "heartland" would be arbitrary and would exceed the Commission's mandate. V AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL: MODIFY THE ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDELINES TO FOCUS ON DETERRENCE AND PROVIDE NEEDED FLEXIBILITY Having examined the failings of the Proposed Guidelines, this Comment will now suggest a more flexible set of guidelines that would more effectively deter environmental crime.22' A. Basing the Environmental Guidelines on the Organizational Guidelines will Minimize Complexity and Confusion The same rationales that underlie the Organizational Guidelines should inform the Environmental Guidelines. The complexity of the Proposed Guidelines impairs their effectiveness. The Environmental Guidelines should not repeat this problem. One observer notes that unnecessary complexity will result from the promulgation of competing guidelines for environmental and non- environmental violations arising out of the same factual circum- stances.222 Guidelines issues already dominate the Ninth Circuit's docket.223 Judge Noonan indicates that "any lawyer of ability is able to raise a doubt, point to an ambiguity, or discover a new problem [in the existing guidelines]."224 Adding new guidelines to the mix could only worsen the inefficiency of the current ones. priorities in environmental enforcement. See Sharp &amp; Shen, supra note 155, at *293, "295-*306 (arguing that the Guidelines actually violate legislative directives in many instances). 221. Indeed, this is precisely the approach endorsed in February of 1996 by President Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development, a panel made up of representatives from both industry and environmental groups. The panel calls for a regulatory framework that would give businesses more flexibility in preventing pollution if the net result led to better performance than under the current system. John H.

Members of the Sentencing Commission recognize the value in terms of administrability of basing the Environmental Guidelines on the Chapter Eight Organiza- tional Guidelines.225 To avoid added complexities, the Environmental Guidelines should depart from the Organizational Guidelines only where a compelling argument exists to do so. However, the approach set out in Chapter Eight cannot adequately deal with the diversity of environmental crime. To encourage compli- ance with environmental laws, and to promote the goal of deterrence (rather than retribution), the Environmental Guidelines must be more flexible than Organizational Guidelines. B. Deterrence Must be the Goal of the Environmental Guidelines The introduction to the Sentencing Guidelines lists four principles that guide criminal punishment: deterrence, incapacitation, just pun- ishment, and rehabilitation.226 Incapacitation is not relevant with regard to organizational crime: corporations cannot be incarcerated.227 Reha- bilitation is relevant, as shown by the probation provisions in the Pro- posed Guidelines,228 but rehabilitation falls outside the scope of this Comment. "Just punishment," which this Comment equates with retribution, is the theory that undergirds the Advisory Group's rigid and strict guidelines for organizational environmental crimes. However, no fine short of complete divestiture can achieve true retribution against an or- ganization. Organizations can be destroyed, which the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania demonstrated when it handed down the "corporate death penalty" provided for in the Or- ganizational Guidelines.229 The "death penalty" is a fit punishment for criminal purpose organizations; such organizations should be punished similarly under the Environmental Guidelines. n.240 (1992) (calculating that 5400 guideline sentences were appealed in 1991, while only a negligible number of sentences were appealed before the guidelines were implemented). 225.

Shareholders or directors may choose to terminate management on whose watch fines are imposed. Board members themselves, how- ever, will generally not have to pay the fines unless they are prosecuted as individuals. If retribution against corporate directors is the goal, these individuals already can be, and often are, prosecuted as individu- als.230 Retributive fines against the corporation itself would be superflu- ous and wasteful. To the extent that the market will bear it, any punishment (aside from jail time or the "death penalty") falls on con- sumers.231 Any fine that allows a corporation to stay in business will ul- timately be paid for by stockholders and customers, not by the fictional corporate personality.232 On the whole, attempts at exacting retribution from organizations are misplaced. Punishing organizations can effectively deter organiza- tional environmental crime through its impact on those responsible for the organization. Retribution, however, can only be achieved against individuals: corporations, as "legal fictions," are incapable of under- standing revenge. A fine should be set high enough to deter violations and no higher. Some commentators argue that environmental crimes are especially repugnant and therefore worthy of retributive punishment. As one commentator put it, "[e]nvironmental crimes that cause serious envi- ronmental disruption warrant stricter environmental penalties from a purely ethical perspective."233 It is possible that the harsh fines set out in the Proposed Guidelines would reduce violations by instilling fear in the marginal offender. It is also possible, however, that many well-meaning companies would refrain from lawful conduct for fear of triggering the retributive wrath contained in the guidelines. Such fears have in fact led many states to enact environmental audit privileges that protect compa- nies' internal environmental audits.234 The question ultimately is: Can a desire for retribution justify inef- ficient Environmental Guidelines? The answer is no. Environmental crimes are emotion-laden transgressions, but it is important to remem- ber, as some critics have argued, that the entire notion of corporate cul- 230. Indeed, indictments against individuals are far more common than those against corporations. Of the 569 defendants indicted by Department of Justice for environmental crimes from 1983 to 1989, 165 were corporations and 404 were individuals. Of the 432 convictions, 127 were corporations and 305 were individuals.

C. An Economic Argument for Flexible Environmental Guidelines In case after case, environmental crime has paid. One Advisory Group member has opined that "[e]nvironmental crime remains an ex- cellent market opportunity for the enterprising felon."238 The new En- vironmental Guidelines must therefore eliminate this opportunity through unflinching economic deterrence. As Professors Robert Cooter and Thomas Ulen note, one cannot view the law solely as a provider of justice, for it in fact allocates legal rights according to economic rationality.23"' Economic rationality is use- ful here to sort out the aggregate effect of environmental harm. Fur- ther, economic rationality can assist in the determination of what is and should be "criminal," which is revealed by the debate over whether certain environmental violations should be considered "crimes" given the positive economic effects they engender.24 Finally, economics is relevant in corporate crime, for it is often shareholders and consumers, and not the corporations themselves, who will ultimately pay the fines for the corporate crime.241 Cooter and Ulen argue that there is an optimal level of punishment that will achieve deterrence.242 The Sentencing Guidelines acknowledge that "the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular, 235.

Once a fine is assessed that optimally deters an organization from breaking the law, any addi- tional sanction will unnecessarily harm the organization, its shareholders and employees, and the economy in general. Further, excessive fines will cause organizations to refrain from engaging in lawful behavior for fear of crossing the line. Three of Professor Cooter's charts demonstrate efficient deter- rence. Deterrence is achieved by reaching the optimal combination of certainty and severity of punishment:244 The Efficient Combination of Certainty and Severity of Punishment Certainty of Punishment 1 yl- low cost deterrence line X high cost Do * xt Severity of Punishment y, I -. . .J . . O evrtyo Punshen Once the authorities have chosen the optimal level of deterrence, ... [h]ow should they allocate resources between certainty and severity of punishment? Efficiency requires that the criminal justice system find the point on the deterrence isoquant that involves the least cost. The straight line Do is the deterrence isoquant that corresponds to the socially optimal amount of deterrence. The curved lines represent combinations of certainty and severity of punishment that can be achieved by a given expenditure. For example, the curve labeled "high" indicates the combinations of certainty and severity of punishment that the authorities can achieve by spending, say, $10 million per year on deterrence. The curve labeled "low" indicates the combinations that the authorities can achieve by spending a low amount on deterrence, say, $5 million per year. The combination (xl,yl) is the intersection of the high cost curve and Do; the combination (x*,y*) is the intersection if the low cost curve and Do. Both points are on the same deterrence isoquant and so achieve the same amount of deterrence. Efficiency requires policy-makers to choose the combination (x*,y*) on the low cost curve. In general, the efficient combination of severity and certainty of punishment is found at the point where the lowest cost curve is tangent to the deterrence isoquant. 243. U.S.S.G., supra note 41, ? 1A(3), at 3 ("The Basic Approach") (emphasis added). The Commission claimed, however, that either a "just deserts" approach, which scales punishment to culpability and harm caused, or a "practical 'crime control'" approach would accomplish this goal.

Certainty has historically been costly in environmental prosecutions, however, because there have been so many violations and so few resources with which to prosecute. Indeed, no large corporation was criminally prosecuted under federal environ- mental legislation until 1984.246 Moreover, environmental crimes are especially labor intensive-and therefore costly-for investigators and attorneys.247 Such a combination of low-cost severity and expensive certainty would initially seem to lead to the conclusion that efficient deterrence requires severe punishment because of the low probability of apprehen- sion and conviction.248 Increasing certainty in general requires two re- sources that are often lacking in enforcement: the political will to punish offenders, and the money to pay the enforcement officials. The Advisory Group apparently adopted this logic when it decided that envi- ronmental crimes require stricter guidelines than those for other organ- izational crimes.249 In fact, however, resources allocated to certainty have increased geometrically in recent years, reducing the need for ex- tremely high severity in punishment. In the area of environmental crime, federal and state governments have in recent years committed substantial amounts of funding and firepower towards increasing certainty of punishment. Despite the fact that Congress is reviewing EPA and many environmental statutes, envi- ronmental enforcement is on the rise. Increased enforcement should decrease the pressure to levy artificially high fines designed to set ex- amples and deter others with excessive severity. The number of crimi- nal investigators and prosecutors employed by EPA and DOJ has increased almost 400% since 1986.25 According to a June 16, 1995 report, EPA brought a record number of enforcement actions in fiscal 245.

Twenty-two were convicted.26 According to Barry Hartman, the ex-chief of environmental enforcement at DOJ, "98 per- cent of the federal indictments for environmental crimes result in con- victions."26' EPA and DOJ's recent effectiveness in prosecuting environmental organizations (and individuals) supports the notion that effective enforcement of existing laws-rather than the crafting of harsher guidelines for environmental crimes-is the most effective method of deterring environmental crime. Today, the most efficient and productive way to deter organizations from environmental crimes is to increase the certainty factor rather than the severity factor. This is precisely the direction in which EPA, DOJ, FBI, and Congress have been moving. The new Republican Congress has not made broadly supported efforts toward undoing these gains in prosecutorial resources despite its myriad of efforts to reverse, reform, and eliminate many environmental laws and regulations.262 The FBI continues to investigate environmental crimes,263 and at least some re- gional FBI chiefs plan to step up environmental enforcement.2" Acting CIA director William Studeman views environmental crime as a 258.

The more certain the punishment, the less the need for severity to achieve the op- timal level of deterrence.268 At some point, increasing the severity of punishment achieves no additional deterrence. Increasing certainty, by contrast, is always effec- tive. If the current convictions are already efficiently severe--and, as demonstrated in the American Precision case,269 they can be severe enough to destroy a corporation by divestiture-the best way to achieve optimal deterrence of corporations is to encourage and continue the recent steps that have dramatically increased certainty of punishment for environmental crimes. Increasing certainty is more fair than increasing severity. When certainty is increased, prosecutors can tailor the number of counts in their indictments to fit the crimes actually committed, rather than seek- ing catastrophic fines to overdeter potential violators. Defendants can be sentenced and prosecuted when they commit crime, not just when scant prosecutorial resources are available. The Environmental Guide- lines should not impose inflexible fine ranges that rob prosecutors and judges of the ability to tailor sentences to reflect the heterogeneity of environmental crime. Only flexibility can guarantee effective deter- rence. There are limits to the effectiveness of deterrence, however.

The work group has done just what it should not have done: It has suggested a separate and signifi- cantly different chapter in the Guidelines for environmental of- fenses, without a demonstrated need.273 Both arguments are correct: to the extent that environmental crimes are distinct from other organizational crimes, the Environmental Guidelines should vary from those set out in Chapter Eight; but where they are not, the existing Organizational Guidelines are adequate.

In other respects, the punitive goals are the same for environmental and nonenvironmental crimes. Therefore, the Environmental Guidelines should parallel the existing Organizational Guidelines and deviate from them only when necessary. 1. Far-Reaching Harm and Recidivism are not Unique to Environmental Crimes Environmental crimes differ from other federal crimes in their ca- pacity to affect a broad array of people and ecosystems. The potential for causing widespread harm, however, is not unique to environmental crime. The Advisory Group did not explain why environmental crime merits stricter sentencing guidelines than those covering crimes such as insider trading and narcotics trafficking, which can also have very dif- fuse effects. Pilfering of a corporate treasury can harm thousands of shareholders, just as the emission of a pollutant in violation of a permit can decrease the quality of the air thousands breathe. The former crime is covered by the guidelines of Chapter Eight; why should the latter not be treated the same way?274 It is frequently said that environmental crimes are unique because of their extended latency periods. Granted, some environmental crimes do not manifest themselves for many years, but the effects of others are immediate. Much of the impact of the Valdez tragedy, for example, "quickly became apparent."275 Many prosecutors and environmentalists argue that environmental crime is unique in its impact on communities. United States v. Baumann,276 a recent criminal case against two individuals convicted of disposing chemicals in a housing project's dumpsters, highlighted the concern with community impact. In response to Baumann, an EPA assistant administrator stated that "[t]he government will not tolerate any community being used as an illegal waste dump .... We certainly 274. W.

Congress' enactment of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act reflects the government's concern with this impact.279 If this element were present in all environmental crimes, separate, strict, and inflexible guidelines would be warranted. However, while crimes such as those in Baumann can affect entire communities, others are isolated events. Criminal transport of hazardous waste under the RCRA may involve a permit violation that, while meriting criminal punishment, harms no one. Some environmental crimes have effects that fall somewhere between massive impact and no impact; for exam- ple, a geographically remote violation of the Clean Air Act might affect only a small handful of individuals. Thus, it is the heterogeneity of en- vironmental crimes, and not their potentially widespread impact, that makes them unique. Many commentators argue that recidivism is a special concern with environmental crime. Not long ago, many environmental "crimes" were in fact implicitly or explicitly condoned by Congress, the Execu- tive Branch, and the public. The Advisory Group feels that organiza- tions are more inclined to view environmental crimes as a cost of transacting business than as conduct morally stigmatized by society.280 This attitude suggests that businesses will be repeat offenders of envi- ronmental laws. However, recidivism is not unique to environmental crimes. Corporations have been deceiving shareholders for centuries. Again, organizations are only boundedly rational: they sometimes do not respond to sanctions the way logic indicates they should. This "bounded rationality" applies to sanctions for all varieties of criminal behavior, environmentally related or not. Moreover, the Organizational Guidelines and the environmental statutes already sufficiently address recidivism. Under both the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, for example, the penalties of post- conviction repeat offenders are doubled if the violator knowingly vio- lates the Acts or their permit limitations.281 Any additional sanction against recidivism that the Environmental Guidelines might propose would be overkill. 277.

The Lack of a Precedential Background Favors More Flexible Guidelines Environmental crimes are unique in their recent vintage.282 Though some environmental crimes have been on the books since the turn of the century, prosecutors did not prosecute violations to any real extent until the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act were amended in 1977.283 The Advisory Group felt that this was one justification for imposing a different sentencing structure on environmental crime.2"4 Because rela- tively few environmental crimes had reached the sentencing phase be- fore the Proposed Guidelines were released, the Proposed Guidelines were not based on an experience baseline of past sentencing prece- dents,285 but were based rather on percentages of maximum fines. Lack of sentencing precedent does not justify the promulgation of stricter guidelines for environmental organizational crimes than for all others. As noted above, the lack of an experience baseline should mili- tate in favor of more flexible sentencing guidelines, so that the median "heartland" can be established.286 Judges must be given the opportu- nity to feel out the relatively new criminal provisions of environmental statutes, and not be forced by guidelines to levy stiff fines against or- ganizational defendants. Moreover, if Congress had desired strict sen- tencing for environmental crimes in all cases, it would not have provided such wide latitude in the statutory fine ranges.287 This Comment proposes that the Commission adopt fine ranges at least double those of the Proposed Guidelines. For example, the Pro- posed Guidelines provide that a crime of offense level eighteen should be punished at sixty- to eighty-percent of the statutory maximum. This Comment proposes increasing that range to fifty- to ninety-percent, or 282. "Federal environmental laws are of relatively recent origin.

E. The Heterogeneity of Environmental Crime Requires that Judges Have More Discretion, Not Less The Guidelines are supposed to address unjustified sentencing dis- parity-the different treatment of similarly situated offenders-and are not supposed to eliminate all judicial discretion.288 Unjustified sentenc- ing disparity sometimes occurs in environmental crime due to its het- erogeneity: differently situated environmental offenders can be convicted of dissimilar crimes under the same statute. For example, the negligent dumping of a small amount of toxic waste by a small corporation is not the same crime as the intentional dumping of a large amount of waste by a large corporation with the re- sources for an extensive, proactive compliance program. However, both crimes would violate the same provisions of the RCRA. As a matter of fairness, the former crime should not be punished at the same percent- age of the statutory maximum as the latter. Congress would agree, as indicated by the broad fine ranges in many environmental statutes.289 The Proposed Guidelines, however, would fine both corporations at or near 100% of the statutory maximum fine.2" The disparate impact of environmental crimes requires more sentencing discretion in order to avoid such unjust results. Egregiously committed environmental crimes causing wide- ranging harm should be severely punished. "However, governmental representatives on the [Advisory Group] observed that demonstrable harm was present in substantially less than ten percent" of environ- mental crimes.29' Though the harm in many environmental crimes may be difficult to measure, it follows from this statistic that many criminal cases involve mere violations of "legal and technical requirements" of environmental statutes.292 Technical violations should not be punished at the same fine level as seriously damaging criminal acts. Furthermore, many corporate environmental crimes are not so clearly harmful or immoral as to give notice of their likely prohibited character.293 For example, a small organization might well be unaware that it is a crime to discharge an industrial pollutant without an Army 288.

This characteristic of environmental crime indicates the need for more, and not less, flexibility in sentencing. Flexibility is needed in organizational environmental sentencing because multiple environmental violations are often not worse than sin- gle violations. Multiple counts of insider trading, discrimination, or bribery may be more worthy of punishment and deterrence than single counts. Businesspeople who repeatedly engage in insider trading may as a rule merit longer sentences than those who have only broken the law once. In the case of many environmental crimes, however, the im- pact of one large violation on air, water, or other aspects of the envi- ronment may be much more substantial than numerous small violations.296" For example, a transporter who hauls a thousand pounds of haz- ardous waste and dumps the waste illegally will likely harm the envi- ronment more than a transporter who ships a small amount of unpermitted waste once a week for two months (or eight weeks). The RCRA by its own terms can take into account these discrepancies, for such a violation is punished "up to" $50,000 per-day-per-violation. This provision allows a judge to fine the first defendant at or close to the statutory maximum, and the second closer to the floor.297 But the Pro- posed Guidelines would destroy this flexibility by presumptively pun- ishing both transporters at 100% of the maximum statutory $50,000 per-day-per-violation. Under the Proposed Guidelines, absent mitiga- tion, the second transporter could be fined a total of $400,000, while the former would only be assessed a $50,000 fine.298 294.

Guerci and Hemphill give two useful examples: First suppose a company fills in 5 acres of wetlands in one day. Alternatively, assume that the company fills in one-half acre of wetlands over ten separate days. There is no environmental difference, yet the [proposed] guidelines would require the sentencing court to impose a fine in the second example for ten 'volitional' acts that is ten times that in the first example. Secondly, assume that a company illegally discharges 500 gallons of wastewater into a river on one day. Alternatively, suppose that the company discharges 50 gallons of the same wastewater per day for ten days. If there is any environmental difference, it is that the first "high dose" situation is worse, yet the guidelines would require the sentencing court to impose a fine in the second hypothetical that is greater than the first.

Because of the ex- ceptionally broad scope of environmental statutes and environmental crimes, the guidelines for these crimes must be more flexible than those for nonenvironmental crimes. Certain corporations need to be punished extensively for their injuries to the environment. Others, who make more proactive efforts to meet their obligations to the environment, or whose crimes have a minimal impact on the environment, merit a lesser fine.3? Congress itself recognized the heterogeneity of environmental crime and conduct by providing environmental enforcers broad discre- tion under most criminal environmental statutes. Congress understood that it could not feasibly micromanage such a heterogeneous area. The Environmental Guidelines should not negate this discretion by imposing inflexible provisions. The inflexibility of the Proposed Guidelines would create an in- centive for prosecutors to engage in count-stacking-maximizing the counts in indictments in order to secure potentially higher penalties and greater leverage in plea bargaining.3"' In practice, prosecutorial plea 299.

F. The Guidelines Must Contain More Flexible Compliance Criteria A compliance program with no teeth is worthless and wasteful. The prosecutors on the Advisory Group believed that unless a very rigid compliance program was put into place, they would be unable to distin- guish "good" programs from "bad" ones, thus creating the risk of giving organizations free credits for paper compliance programs.303 This argument is a compelling one, and the Environmental Guidelines must encourage effective, meaningful compliance with environmental laws. But the seven criteria that the Proposed Guidelines require a cor- poration to meet to qualify for fine mitigation are too difficult with which to comply. Requiring a state-of-the-art, "Cadillac" program may make sense for civil fines, which are meted out merely for not ad- hering to standards of desirable conduct (and which do not lead to cor- porate probation), but mitigation of criminal liability should not be based on top-shelf compliance programs. A good-faith program that effectively deals with environmental regulatory compliance, but nonetheless fails to meet guideline require- ments, should entitle an organization to some mitigation of criminal fines. Companies like 3M, which has been at the forefront in establish- ing proactive compliance programs, argue that organizations that devote significant resources toward reducing their impact on the environment should be rewarded with flexible treatment.3? 1. The Guidelines Must Encourage Organizations to Set Up Compliance Programs Any compliance program criteria the Commission adopts must ad- dress the following question: why should organizations bother at- tempting to comply? If the compliance criteria required for fine "prosecutors are now free to ignore... the sentencing guidelines ....

It is likely this percentage will increase if stricter, narrower guidelines are implemented. For an argument that such plea bargaining impairs effective punishment of crime, see generally Stephen J.

As Rock- well International queried in a sentencing memorandum, if a company that invests heavily in a compliance program "is then rewarded with the wrath the Government normally reserves for the recalcitrant, is such ef- fort warranted?"3?5 The need to provide incentives for compliance is heightened by the low risk of prosecution for environmental crimes. While prosecution of organizational environmental crimes is increasing geometrically, an or- ganization's risk of incurring criminal sanctions remains low. From 1984-87, for example, only one percent of all federal criminal actions were filed against organizations.3" Because today the risk of prosecu- tion is still statistically low (despite the increase in certainty of punish- ment), the Environmental Guidelines cannot depend solely on deterrence to achieve compliance. Rather, the guidelines must provide carrots as well as sticks. They must encourage compliance by making it easy to accomplish. Some members of the Advisory Group seemed skeptical of the benefit of very rigid compliance programs."7 They were in part con- cerned over whether it is proper to punish severely defendant corpora- tions who fail to meet rigid compliance criteria despite efforts at compliance. No doubt, extremely high punishments would deter crime. Again, though, excessive deterrence is counterproductive because it de- ters legitimate, desirable activity along with crime.38 Further, the com- bination of unnecessarily strict and rigid compliance criteria with the fifty-percent collar may well lead organizations to abandon efforts at crafting effective compliance programs. Such a result would not only be economically inefficient, but, more importantly, would cause more environmental harm because organizations on the margin of compli- ance would cease their efforts to comply. 2. Five Steps the Sentencing Commission Should Take The Sentencing Commission should take five steps to encourage meaningful compliance. First, rather than adopting the strict compli- ance program requirements set out in the Proposed Guidelines, the Commission should adopt a modified version of the more flexible crite- 305. Karl A.

See supra notes 231-237 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="53">1996] DETERRING ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME 359 ria set out in the Organizational Guidelines. Because courts and organi- zations are already somewhat familiar with the Organizational Guide- lines, the more closely the Environmental Guidelines resemble them, the more needless confusion will be avoided. The Organizational Guidelines require that an organization must have taken "at a minimum" the following seven types of steps towards compliance in order to qualify for fine mitigation: (1) The organization must have established compliance standards.., that are reasonably capable of reducing the pros- pect of criminal conduct. (2) Specific individual(s) [in the organization's upper management] must have been assigned overall responsibility to oversee compliance with [the compliance standards]. (3) The organization must have used due care not to delegate.., authority to individuals whom the organization knew, or should have known.., had a propensity to engage in illegal activities. (4) The organization must have taken steps to communi- cate effectively its standards to all employees and other agents, e.g., by requiring participation in training programs or by dis- seminating publications that explain in a practical manner what is required. (5) The organization must have taken reasonable steps to achieve compliance with its standards, e.g., by monitor- ing.., its employees and other agents and by [implementing] a reporting system whereby employees and other agents could re- port criminal conduct.., without fear of retribution. (6) The standards must have been consistently enforced through appropriate disciplinary mechanisms, includ- ing.., discipline..,. for the failure to detect an offense. [Appropriate discipline must be determined in a case specific manner]. (7) After an offense has been detected, the organization must have taken all reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the offense and to prevent further similar offenses-including any necessary modifications to its [compliance program].3 The Organizational Guidelines also state that "the larger the corpora- tion, the more formal the program typically should be."310 These seven criteria alone would probably not be enough to bring about effective compliance in the environmental realm, because they fail 309.

Application Note 3(k)(7)(i), at 342.</page><page sequence="54">360 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:307 to address at least one important issue: management involvement.31' It is crucial that the Environmental Guidelines encourage management itself, rather than compliance attorneys, to craft and implement compliance programs. Isolated attorneys in downtown law offices cannot ade- quately manage a company's day-to-day environmental compliance. Therefore, this Comment proposes adding an eighth criterion to the seven set out in the Organizational Guidelines: (8) Management must be involved in crafting, execut- ing, supervising, and implementing the organization's compli- ance program and must oversee its day-to-day administration. Adopting this eighth factor would move compliance off lawyers' desks and into the hands of line managers. The Organizational Guidelines do not present ideal compliance criteria. However, if expanded to contain the key "eighth" criterion, they would substantially encourage compliance. Further, basing the Environmental Guidelines' mitigation test on an expanded version of the existing seven-factor test would reduce the confusion that comes with new rules. The second step the Commission should take is to craft Environ- mental Guidelines that are especially flexible for smaller organizations. In a small organization, the stakeholders are often also the managers. Thus, there is little incentive to develop a compliance program because these manager-shareholders often can be prosecuted as individuals.32 In a closely-held corporation, it may not matter to the president and owner of the outstanding stock whether it is he or his corporation that is criminally fined. By contrast, a large organization is more capable of insulating itself from its employees' illegal conduct.313 Therefore, small organizations need more of an incentive than large ones to set up effec- tive compliance programs. While a large organization may have the resources to pay for a compliance program as a cost of doing business, smaller companies' resources are more limited. Small organizations end up squeezed: they derive fewer legal and economic benefits from implementing compliance programs, and must expend a higher per- centage of their resources to implement them.314 311. See Coffee, supra note 48, at 29 (describing the Advisory Group's rejection of the Organizational Guidelines' test, partly because corporate counsel felt it did not adequately encourage managerial involvement in environmental compliance). 312. See Kezsbom &amp; Goldman, supra note 48, at 8-12 to 8-13. 313. Id. at 8-13. 314. The Sentencing Commission's review of past practice data revealed that while judges did seem to consider the size of the offending corporation in sentencing organizations, they did not do so in a systematic way. Nagel &amp; Swenson, supra note 2, at 248.</page><page sequence="55">1996] DETERRING ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME 361 To encourage small businesses to comply, this Comment proposes that the following be added to the Commentary on the Environmental Guidelines' section on compliance criteria: Small organizations should demonstrate the same overall degree of commitment to environmental compliance as larger ones. However, small organizations need not enact programs as formal as large organizations; nor need they necessarily expend the same amount of resources as would be expected of large or- ganizations.315 Maximum mitigation should only be awarded when the or- ganization has met all eight compliance criteria. In the case of small organizations, however, the court should award some miti- gation credit for compliance programs that take substantial steps toward environmental compliance but do not satisfy all eight criteria. Courts should look to the resources of the organization in determining if creditable steps were taken toward compliance. Adopting the eight criteria for environmental compliance programs, along with the above comment, would provide the flexibility required for sentencing small organizations. With more flexible guidelines, smaller organizations are more likely to find compliance efforts feasible and beneficial. The Commission's third step should be to eliminate or substantially reduce the fifty-percent "collar" on offense level mitigation. Of course, liability for an organizational crime should not be wiped out just because a company has a compliance program. However, the Proposed Guidelines' cap on mitigation would unnecessarily deter compliance. Especially for a large corporation with the resources to absorb a fine, a fifty-percent reduction may not be enough to justify, in terms of the bottom line, the resources required to create an effective compliance program. Some fine floor may be necessary to achieve adequate general de- terrence, but a fifty-percent cap dampens incentives to implement effec- tive compliance programs. This Comment proposes instead a ten- percent floor. This floor will still ensure that organizations get the mes- sage that environmental crime will not be tolerated-ten-percent of RCRA's $50,000 per-day-per-violation fine can still add up to a steep fine. At the same time, keeping the floor relatively low will ensure that efforts to implement compliance programs will be respected. This, in turn, will encourage organizations that do not have such programs to implement them. 315. The first two sentences of this proposed Commentary are reworked versions of the language presented in the Proposed Guidelines. See supra text accompanying note 192; Proposed Guidelines, supra note 8, ? 9D1.1, Cmt. 3, at 1383.</page><page sequence="56">362 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:307 As a fourth step, the Commission should recognize that the fact that a compliance program does not meet specific mitigation criteria should not preclude it from mitigation credit. The Organizational Guidelines state that only a presumption exists that a program not meeting its seven criteria is inadequate.316 Similar language should be adopted in the En- vironmental Guidelines. By creating a presumption against finding nonconforming programs effective, the guidelines can encourage pro- grams that meet their criteria, and define the parameters of which pro- grams qualify, while at the same time giving good-faith programs that fail to qualify some mitigation credit. The guidelines should allow maximum mitigation for a program meeting the statutory criteria, and reduced mitigation for noncomplying but diligent programs. Fifth, the Commission should implement the Environmental Guidelines' compliance factors as a series of policy statements rather than as mandatory guidelines. Some commentators have argued that discretionary policy statements do not ensure the definite results neces- sary to establish effective deterrence.317 However, while mandatory guidelines may arguably be more effective in some instances, flexible policy statements would afford judges the freedom and flexibility nec- essary to account for the heterogeneity of environmental crime. Since neither Congress's nor the Commission's enabling statute requires mandatory guidelines, policy statements are a permissible approach.38 The Commission is entitled to issue nonbinding policy statements which sentencing courts must "consider."319 The Commission used both mandatory guidelines and policy statements in the Organizational Guidelines, employing mandatory guidelines for the key provisions but allowing non-binding policy statements to cover less crucial provi- sions.320 The Commission should expand upon this approach for the Environmental Guidelines and increase the proportion of policy state- ments to account for the wide-ranging differences among environ- mental crimes. The danger with nonbinding policy statements is that courts, al- though required to "consider" them, could ignore them. However, concern over the great variety of environmental crime led the Commis- 316. "An organization's failure to incorporate and follow applicable industry practice or the standards called for by any applicable governmental regulation weighs against a finding of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law." U.S.S.G., supra note 41, ? 8A1.2., Application Note 3(k), at 342 (emphasis added). 317. See, e.g., Nagel &amp; Swenson, supra note 2, at 243-44. 318. See Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., The Death of Discretion? Reflections on the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, 101 HARV. L. REV. 1938, 1946-47 (1988).

Such provisions included remedial orders, conditions of probation, and precise fine selection. Nagel &amp; Swenson, supra note 2, at 241-42.</page><page sequence="57">1996] DETERRING ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME 363 sion to exclude such crimes from the Organizational Guidelines in the first place.321 Environmental sentencing cries out for flexibility, and policy statements can provide that flexibility while at the same time re- ducing sentencing disparities. As the Supreme Court has noted, "a con- sistency produced by ignoring individual differences is a false consistency."322 Policy statements would eliminate false and draconian consistency while promoting fair, rational consistency. Policy statements that are specific and strict should adequately de- ter organizations. Concededly, it is possible that discretionary policy statements would not deter environmental crime as well as mandatory guidelines. However, under the approach proposed in this Comment, fixed fine ranges will still be in place to warn organizations of the con- sequences of environmental crime. The discretionary policy statements will merely allow courts flexibility in determining whether an organiza- tion's compliance program merits fine mitigation and in considering an offending organization's resources. Finally, in conjunction with the policy statement approach, the Commission should expand upon the approach already taken in the Or- ganizational Guidelines and not require governmental motions for guidelines departures in the case of environmental crimes.323 At least one federal judge endorses dispensing with such a requirement.324 Such an approach would allow courts more freedom to take into account the widely differing circumstances of environmental crimes and would dis- courage count-stacking. G. Consideration Should be Given to Good-Faith Efforts to Cooperate and Comply Offender cooperation is crucial to the mitigation of environmental harm. The harm in nonenvironmental crimes is often relatively easy to identify and evaluate. A dollar figure can generally be put on insider trading, for example, and the injured parties can usually be identified. Environmental crimes, however, often affect large numbers of unidenti- fied individuals and can take years to make their effects apparent. Of- fender cooperation is thus essential to dealing with this type of crime. Further, quick remedial action is often required to stem environ- mental damage. Environmental harm can be reduced exponentially when spills are quickly attended to or dumping is quickly rectified. Again, offender cooperation often determines the extent and rapidity of 321. See supra note 48 and accompanying text. 322. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 112 (1982), cited in Ogletree, supra note 318, at 1958. 323.

REP. 190 (1993).</page><page sequence="58">364 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 84:307 such remedial action. Thus, the Environmental Guidelines should en- courage cooperation to a greater extent than the Organizational Guide- lines do, and to a much greater extent than the restrictive Proposed Guidelines would have. The Proposed Guidelines state that "no [mitigating] credit shall be given for mere compliance with an applicable federal reporting re- quirement."325 Granted, defendants as a rule should not have their sen- tences reduced merely because they have complied with laws everyone must follow. Reporting environmental crime should be an exception, however, because early notification can be especially helpful. The Proposed Guidelines' approach would deter reporting. Some mitigation credit should be given to encourage reporting, even though federal law already mandates it.326 The Environmental Guidelines should promote offender compliance and cooperation wherever possi- ble, and especially in the area of reporting.327 The Organizational Guidelines' approach to reporting is more flexible than the Proposed Guidelines': it allows a two-point reduction in culpability score if the organization fully cooperated with authorities and clearly demonstrated affirmative acceptance of responsibility for its criminal conduct.328 The Organizational Guidelines also allow a one- point reduction for meeting the latter requirement.329 No analogous provisions exist in the Proposed Guidelines, but they should be adopted in the Environmental Guidelines. In fact, the Envi- ronmental Guidelines should allow greater cooperation deductions than the Organizational Guidelines do--this Comment suggests at least dou- ble the deductions--because reporting and the immediate taking of re- sponsibility are particularly important in the environmental realm. 325.

The Sentencing Commission has the Right to Allow Greater Discretion in the Sentencing of Environmental Crimes This Comment endorses a more discretionary approach than that set out in the Proposed Guidelines in order to account for the heteroge- neity of environmental crime. Such an approach is not contrary to the goals of sentencing guidelines. Granted, the Sentencing Guidelines were enacted to reduce judicial discretion in favor of consistency and increased deterrence value.330 However, they were not intended to elimi- nate all judicial discretion. Even the strict Proposed Guidelines allow for some judicial discretion, but not enough to account for the diversity of environmental crime and the disparate impact fines have on small organizations. This Comment suggests that the Commission increase the discretion set out in the Proposed Guidelines by increasing the size of the fine ranges, broadening the types of compliance programs that can qualify for fine mitigation, expanding the ability of courts to ac- count for the size of organizations, giving credit for cooperation with enforcement authorities, and lowering the mitigation cap in the collar provision. Even if the Commission were to adopt all five suggestions listed above, the Environmental Guidelines would still provide for less judicial discretion than the Organizational Guidelines already do.331 Thus, the proposals would marry sentencing flexibility with an effective reduction of unjust sentencing disparity. In sum, the proposals set out in this Comment are not only prudent-for a flexible set of criteria will best encourage effective compliance with environmental laws-but are also fully consistent with the purpose of having sentencing guidelines. CONCLUSION The Sentencing Commission should craft Environmental Guide- lines that both parallel and expand upon the Organizational Guidelines. Mimicking the Organizational Guidelines will reduce the inefficient confusion that comes with new, unfamiliar regulations. Expanding upon them will allow courts to address areas peculiar to environmental crime: the need for flexibility to account for the heterogeneity of envi- ronmental violations, the appropriateness of deterrence as a foundation 330. See 28 U.S.C. ? 991(b)(1)(B) (1994) (stating that the purposes of the Sentencing Comission include the avoidance of unwarranted disparities between similar defendants and the provision of "certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing"). 331. This Comment's suggestions would, in contrast to the Organizational Guidelines, retain a rigid fine table, see supra text following note 271, and require much more management involvement, see supra note 311 and accompanying text, both of which requirements would reduce judicial discretion.</page><page sequence="60">366 CALIFORNIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 84:307 for the sentencing scheme, and the diversity of small and large organ- izational offenders. The goal of the Environmental Guidelines must be deterrence, not retribution. Properly modified, the Organizational Guidelines can ac- complish optimal deterrence by tailoring sentences in light of the cir- cumstances of the offense and the resources of the offender. The Organizational Guidelines, as modified by the proposals of this Com- ment, would achieve deterrence while maintaining flexibility and di- minishing sentencing disparity. They should therefore provide the basis for the new Chapter Nine of the sentencing guidelines. APPENDIX A PRACTICAL RAMIFICATIONS: HOW ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE The best way for organizations to protect themselves from criminal prosecution is through comprehensive compliance programs. Com- mentators fiercely debate the utility of such programs and their efficacy in protecting the environment, but under the current climate, compli- ance programs are the norm. The Organizational Guidelines,332 EPA,333 the ABA,334 and the DOJ335 all encourage compliance programs. The Sentencing Commission will almost certainly adopt some form of de- tailed compliance program in the Environmental Guidelines.336 The presence of an effective compliance program may also persuade a prosecutor not to indict in the first place.337 Furthermore, both the Pro- posed Guidelines and the Organizational Guidelines authorize probation for organizations that have no effective program in place to detect and 332.

At least for larger organizations, compliance programs often make economic sense. An organization is better off proactively trying to pre- vent liability than having to deal with remediation in the future. Thus, to protect themselves and the environment, corporations should expand their existing programs, no matter how comprehensive they already are.339 Corporate codes, adopted with the hope that they can later be in- voked for legal protection, are commonplace.34 However, companies can expect that their programs will fail to meet the strict criteria of any Environmental Guidelines adopted in the future. Organizations must therefore make existing programs more diligent, even if they already meet the standards set out in the Organizational Guidelines. At a minimum, organizational compliance programs should do the following: 1. Create An Independent Audit Committee. EPA, DOJ, and the Proposed Guidelines" all call for frequent auditing. These audits can create problems for organizations. First, if the audit does uncover defi- ciencies in the organization's compliance program, those deficiencies must be corrected in a timely fashion. Second, under federal law, there is currently no statutory privilege for communications relating to envi- ronmental audits.342 Both of these factors can act as an incentive for or- 338.

Audits are a necessary part of an effective compliance program, however, and are good evidence of such a program. To address the problems arising from audits, corporations should limit the circulation of any internal environmental audits so as not to destroy any potential claims of attorney-client or work-product privi- lege that may protect such documents.343 (Note that the actual facts dis- covered by an audit--e.g., the existence of toxic waste-are not protected under these privileges. Only discussions and analyses of facts are so protected.344) Of course, such a strategy will increase the ethical burdens on attorneys. As one commentator noted: "[t]he sentencing guidelines give the in-house corporate attorney a mandate to be the corporation's ethical conscience."'345 Outside audits may also prove useful, as their independence lends an air of credibility to compliance programs. The Proposed Guidelines state that external evaluations should be implemented periodically "[i]f appropriate to the size and nature of the corporation."346 Organizations have a conflicting incentive not to use outside audits, however, because to Environmental Auditing, 59 Fed.

See, e.g., Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. v. Textron, Inc., 157 F.R.D. 522, 524-27 (N.D. Fla. 1994). Generally, though, it is unlikely that an audit will actually receive such protection in federal court.

To preserve any possible attor- ney-client privilege, it may be best to chair this committee with an attor- ney. 2. Craft In-depth Training Programs. The Commentary to the Organizational Guidelines suggests, and the Proposed Guidelines re- quire, employee and agent participation in training programs in order for the corporation's fine to be mitigated.348 The definition of the word "agent" is unclear, but it would be prudent to extend these training programs to contractors over which the organization exercises some control. Training programs should be as formal and detailed as possible to ensure that they meaningfully add to compliance efforts. In the case of all but very small organizations, management should create a written manual describing the organization's environmental compliance pro- gram and setting out specific employee duties under the program. Management should also conduct seminars instructing employees on how to stay in compliance with environmental laws, and explain to em- ployees in detail all environmental regulations. A general "code of conduct" will probably be inadequate under future Environmental Guidelines. 3. Disseminate the Compliance Program to all Employees and Agents. Many organizations distribute their codes of conduct to a lim- ited cross-section of employees (typically management).349 The Organ- izational Guidelines, however, require communication to "all employees and other agents."3" The Proposed Guidelines have no directly analo- gous requirement, but they do require a defendant organization to have implemented training programs that are adequate to "maintain up-to- date, sufficiently detailed understanding of all applicable environmental 347.

Employees and agents should also be required to acknowledge in writing that they have read and understood the terms of their compli- ance programs.352 4. Set Up an Internal, Anonymous Reporting System. The Organ- izational Guidelines suggest "having in place and publicizing a report- ing system whereby employees and other agents could report criminal conduct.., without fear of retribution.'3""53 The Proposed Guidelines have a similar requirement and suggest using hotlines.354 A hotline at- tached to a voice-mail service or an answering machine is a prudent and inexpensive method of creating an anonymous reporting system. Or- ganizations with limited resources can use a suggestion box instead. Note that any report developed from such a hotline will generally not be protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine.355 To address this concern, organizations may wish to request the minimum amount of information necessary for management to investigate the complaint. 5. Include Enforcement Mechanisms and Sanctions for Environ- mental Violations. The Organizational Guidelines require that an or- ganization's standards be "consistently enforced through appropriate disciplinary mechanisms, including, as appropriate, discipline of indi- viduals responsible for the failure to detect an offense."'356 The Pro- posed Guidelines would have required consistent and visible enforcement of the organization's environmental policies, as well as a system of incentives to reward employees and agents for "contributions to environmental excellence."357 A program without teeth is unlikely to meet the Environmental Guidelines' standards. Therefore, a mechanism specifically tailored to environmental violations should be disseminated in the compliance manual and enforced, and incentives should be put in place to encourage employees and agents to comply with environmental laws and to report violations. Employees should be punished for any and all violations of the organization's compliance program. 351. Proposed Guidelines, supra note 8, ? 9Dl.l(a)(4)(i), at 1383. 352.

The Proposed Guidelines specifically state that a defendant organization must carry the burden of demonstrating that it made the substantial commitment necessary for mitigation, and that the demonstration should be made "primarily by providing docu- mentation."358 The Organizational Guidelines are more vague, and do not directly discuss the general burden of proof or documentation is- sues. Any version of the Environmental Guidelines is likely to place this burden on the organization, however. Organizations should there- fore make sure all programs, incentives, enforcement efforts, and anonymous reports are documented. 7. Surpass Your Peers. Under the Organizational Guidelines, the sentencing court gives favorable treatment to compliance programs that are more advanced than those of other comparable organizations.359 The Proposed Guidelines allow mitigation for "additional innovative approaches" that are "effective and important" to carrying out the or- ganization's commitment to environmental compliance.3 Having an advanced program will thus be helpful in achieving mitigation of any sentences for environmental violations. 8. No Matter How Scant Your Resources, Do What You Can. The Proposed Guidelines, as discussed above, make minimal accommoda- tions for small businesses. It is thus important for small businesses to implement the most comprehensive programs they can muster in order to demonstrate their commitment to proactive compliance. Smaller or- ganizations must recognize that their efforts may be held to extremely high standards, despite their lack of sophistication and resources. Fair or not, small organizations must make even greater efforts at enacting effective compliance programs than their larger brethren, given that the consequences of unmitigated fines are proportionately greater for them. APPENDIX B How ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME WOULD BE SENTENCED UNDER THE PROPOSED GUIDELINES The Proposed Guidelines break environmental crimes up into six sentencing categories:361 1. "Knowing Endangerment Resulting From Mishandling Haz- ardous or Toxic Substances, Pesticides or Other Pollutants."362 The base offense level for such crimes under the Proposed Guidelines is 358.

"Mishandling of Hazardous or Toxic Substances or Pesticides; Recordkeeping, Tampering, and Falsification."373 a. The Base Level. The Proposed Guidelines assign to these crimes a base offense level of eight,374 which corresponds to fifteen to twenty-five percent of the statutory maximum fine.375' Under the Pro- posed Guidelines, "[i]f the offense resulted in an ongoing, continuous, or repetitive discharge, release, or emission," the fine is increased by six levels,376" or if it "otherwise involved a discharge, release, or emission of a hazardous or toxic substance or pesticide," the fine is increased by four levels.377" b.

"Mishandling of Other Environmental Pollutants: Recordkeep- ing, Tampering, and Falsification."393 a. The Offense Level. Under the Proposed Guidelines, the base level penalty for mishandling nontoxic pollutants is somewhat lower than those for the mishandling of toxic or hazardous pollutants. The base offense level is six,394 or ten percent of the maximum statutory fine.395 "If the offense resulted in an ongoing, continuous, or repetitive discharge, release, or emission," the fine is increased by six levels.396" If it "otherwise involved a discharge, release, or emission of a pollutant," the fine is increased by four levels.397 b.

The Offense Level. Under the Proposed Guidelines, the base offense level for tampering with a public water system is eighteen,4? or sixty to eighty percent of the maximum statutory fine."5 There is no analogous sentencing category in the Organizational Guidelines. "If the offense resulted in an ongoing, continuous, or repetitive release of a contaminant into a public water system or lasted for a substantial period of time," the fine is increased by two levels." Thus crimes relating to tampering with the public water system will in most cases be fined at or close to the maximum statutory fine. b. The Fines. As there is no analogous provision in the Organ- izational Guidelines, there is no case law indicating precisely which envi- ronmental statutes would in practice be sentenced under this section. It is likely that the above described offenses under the CWA and the SDWA could also be sentenced under this heading if they involved a public water system. Under the CWA, there is a minimum $2,500 and maximum $25,000 per-day-per-violation criminal fine if a defendant negligently introduced pollutants to a sewer system or municipal treat- ment system"; the minimum and maximum amounts are doubled for knowingly introducing pollutants.48 5. "Wildlife Violations."" a. The Offense Level. The Proposed Guidelines do not set a base offense level for wildlife violations.410 The Advisory Committee members were unable to agree on what level to ascribe to such viola- tions. However, the Proposed Guidelines do set out characteristics that would have added to the base offense level. "If the offense (a) was committed for pecuniary gain or otherwise involved a commercial pur- pose; or (b) involved a pattern of similar violations," the fine was to be increased by two levels.4" "If the offense (a) involved fish, wildlife, or plants that were not quarantined as required by law; or (b) involved a pattern of similar violations," the fine was to be increased by two lev- els.412 Further, the Proposed Guidelines instruct the judge to use the greater of (a) the increase in number of levels from the table in section 403.
