<plain_text><page sequence="1">79 The Art of Gavrinis presented in its Armorican Context and in Comparison with Ireland Charles-Tanguy LE ROUX The exceptional decoration of the Gavrinis tomb has led, over a century and a half, to many speculations; among them, comparisons with the Irish decorated megaliths, especially those of the Boyne valley and Loughcrew, have a fair place. After the Irish publications of the last decade and the work undertaken at Gavrinis in 1979 -1984, now seems to be the right time for a new approach of this question. As already suggested by E. Shee-Twohig in 1981, the decorated slabs of Gavrinis bear evidence of at least two main stylistic phases; the description and illustration of the different motifs need nevertheless to be done again at a more precise standard. The oldest phase appears directly linked with the art of the Armorican passage tombsby its catalogue of motifs ("buckler", "axe", "crook", "yoke", etc.), and by style and technique. Basically, this art seems to have been introduced into the monument on re-used, already decorated stones; the most spectacular example is indeed the recycling, to cover the chamber, of a slab cut from a 14m high decorated stele, which permits us to link the building of Gavrinis directly with the sequence of the great megalithic style which developed in the Locmariaquer area, some 4-5km to the west. The more recent art includes most of the baroque-looking exuberance which has suggested so many Irish comparisons. But, behind the multiplicity of the lines, it seems that the few common elements are not among the most significant in the two catalogues. From the rules of composition of the decoration, a direct Armorican influence does not emerge any more in Ireland, even for the few panels which could a priori seem especially attractive, in Newgrange or Loughcrew U. Unlike the older style, the more recent decoration seems to have been mainly done in situ; it begins at 2-3 m from the entrance only, while the Boyne art also spreads widely on kerbstones, the tradition of which is almost unknown in Armorican architecture. Lastly, a chronological approach shows that the closing of Gavrinis, at the very end of the Armorican passage grave sequence, occurs approximately at the time when the great monuments of the Boyne area were being erected. The exceptional ornamentation of the Gavrinis long passage and simple square chambered monument has led to a lot of speculations since its discovery, a century and a half ago, among them, comparisons with the famous Irish complexes of the Boyne and Loughcrew areas (see for instance Dechelette, 1,1908, 604-614, Breuil, 1921,1937,1959, etc.). After the Irish studies of the last decades, especially by E. Shee-Twohig (1981), M. J.

Eogan (1986) and the new excavations and restorations undertaken at Gavrinis (Le Roux 1982,1984,1985a, 1985b), this seems a convenient moment for a new look at this question. Some occasional allusions apart, our subject will be limited here to a stylistic examination of the decoration without detailed considerations either about the techniques of execution involved or of the supporting architecture. Let us nevertheless notice that, in Armorica as in Ireland (and also in north-western Iberia), the major realisations of what is called "megalithic art" develop in the heart of great monumental concentrations. On the other hand, even the finest ornamental complexes, imposing as they are, maintain a style which is coherent with the architectural sequence of their respective areas. In other words, in Ireland as in Brittany, this art appears as an achievement of the megalithic phenomenon but certainly not as an artificial addition to it. Since the discovery and first exploration of Gavrinis between 1832 and 1836, much of its iconography has been published, as is fully reviewed by E. Shee-Twohig (1981, 172). But, after the first illustrations accompanying the account of his visit by General Inspector of Historical Monuments Prosper Merimee (1836), three major editorial events can be highlighted: by the end of the last century, the first systematic survey appears in the "Dictionnaire archeologique de la Gaule" (1-1, 1875, pi. 7 -12); half a century later, S. J. Pequart and Z. Le Rouzic give a photographic survey, mostly from the plaster casts made in 1901 by A. Maitre for the Musee des Antiquites Nationales (Pequart and Le Rouzic 1927, pis. 99-133); In 1969-71, E. Shee-Twohig traced directly on cello films the whole visible decoration (Shee-Twohig 1981, fig. 110-122). The comparison of different ancient drawings gives a good impression of the progressive comprehension of this baffling decoration (Figs. 11-13). As E. Shee-Twohig suggested in 1981, the 26 decorated stones of Gavrinis show evidence of at least two stylistic phases but the definitions and classification she proposed then now need to be made more precise, in the light of the new discoveries which have been made since that time in the corpus of Gavrinis art (Le Roux 1982, 1984, 1985a, 1985b) but also in the light of the renewed general approach to the question; let us mention especially the progressive awareness of the importance of stone recycling in the megalithic architecture of the Morbihan and of the existence of a pre-dolmenic phase of large decorated standing stones, since the first sketches (Le Roux et al. 1980, 80-84) to its definitive formalization (L'Helgouach 1983). In the following descriptions, we shall keep the nomenclature adopted by E. Shee Twohig (1981, fig. 110 and following), occasionally completed in the same way for stones not then included (Fig. 14). As most of the discussions will concern surfaces illustrated and described by this author, we shall, except in special cases, omit to repeat this reference which will be supposed to be implicit and almost constant in the forthcoming pages. I - Remains of an Ancient Art Anybody who enters for the first time the crypt of Gavrinis is greatly impressed by its profusion of arc-style decoration. But under a more attentive examination it soon appears that, either by the motifs, the style or the technique, some elements differ clearly from the dominant ornamentation and, generally, seem more directly linked with the classical</page><page sequence="3">THE ART OF GAVRINIS 81 art of the Armorican passage tombs with simple chamber, as summarized for instance by Le Roux etal. (1980), Shee-Twohig (1981, fig. 3), Le Roux (1985, fig. 27-32), etc. Quite often also, the motifs concerned seem to have been executed before the supporting slab was put in place in the monument, which is not clearly the case for the dominant arc style in spite of some assertions (de Closmadeuc 1884, etc.). Several types of occurrences can be observed for this presumably early art, with indeed some intermediate situations. 1 - Previously decorated surfaces directly incorporated a - The lintel R.S.2. Already in his time, Z. Le Rouzic (1935) drew attention to its obliquely rounded edge facing the entrance. Two horned U signs develop there side by side, linked by small boxed arcs and in an almost axial position over the passage. Indeed, we may wonder if this is not the primary entrance lintel of the passage, the single facade walling, which runs from side to side covering the internal "onion skin" structure of the cairn being thus a later addition to be correlated with the first trilithon of the passage, the only one to be made of completely unworked stones. b - The small complementary stone Co.R.6 shows a quite classical axe with its crook-shaped bent haft. The cutting edge of the blade joins the lower edge of the block, which is rather sharp and might well correspond to an ancient break in a previously decorated more important stone (PI. 1, top). c - On slab C.5, two superposed rows of crooks bend symmetrically outwards. The upper one has clearly been decapitated by careless flaking off the central part of the top of the stone while, on both sides, the naturally rounded, shouldered shape has been preserved. Apparently, the aim was to reduce the height of this stone down to the level of its neighbours, in order to provide a fair support for the roofing slab of the chamber (PI. 2). If we mentally complete the central damaged part, the result could be a modest replica (about 3m high including the crude base hidden under the floor slab) of the famous ogival stele which faces the entrance of La Table-des-Marchands at Locmariaquer. Here as there, we have the buckler-shaped crudely anthropomorphic silhouette and its internal decoration of diverging crooks, which is a well-known major component of dolmenic art in Brittany (Cassen and L'Helgouach 1992). The great difference lies in the treatment reserved for these two stones: in Locmariaquer, it has been installed in the place of honour in a chamber apparently specially built for its exceptional size; in Gavrinis, on the other hand, we apparently have a purely utilitarian recycling, without any special regard for aesthetics. 2 - Reversed decorated slabs. a - Jambstone L10 in the passage. Through the gap between L10 and Lll, the left side appears at right angles to the main face. A series of some 15 boxed chevrons cover the full width of this smooth and plain joint surface in its lower half, the decorated surface plunging down to 30cm under the pavement (while the arc-style decoration disappears a few centimetres below today's level of this surface, which was removed during the late 19th century explorations (de Closmadeuc 1884)). b - Lll is a narrow pillar which marks the angle between passage and chamber. Through the same gap as the former, it is possible to catch a glimpse of the rounded rear side of this stone and see a large curious picked motif (PL 4a). The upper ogival part could suggest a variant of the buckler motif but the lower half clearly evokes the cutting part</page><page sequence="4">82 CHARLES-TANGUY LE ROUX 4 __^-?-r ?&gt;- ?

Among different hypotheses, we have suggested (Le Roux 1982) agreement with the interpretation of a polished stone blade engaged in a socket proposed by de Mortillet for the three other comparable motifs already known in his time (de Mortillet 1894). Among these parallels, one is on an apparently isolated standing stone at Le Conquet (Finist&amp;re) but the most interesting probably appears in Pen-Hap passage tomb on the Ile-aux-Moines, less than 3km east of Gavrinis. The stone concerned is also pillar-shaped ; it also stands at the junction of passage and chamber on the left entering the monument and is decorated on two opposite faces; the outer one (thus hidden before the collapse of the cairn) presents a axe-plough or Mane-Rutual type axe in the terminology of Shee-Twohig (1981, 58-67) (the interpretation of this last motif, six examples of which are known, remains uncertain if not putative but, like the former, it seems linked by preference with standing stones). c - The backs of several jambstones were cleared during our excavations and we uncovered on C4 a pair of hafted axes apparently associated with a faint small quadrangular cartouche. The axes are quite typical of the passage tomb style (PI. 5a). d - The sillstone of the chamber (the upper surface of which is partly decorated in the arc-style) was originally engaged in the pavement. During his excavations, de Closmadeuc (1884) noticed that both main sides of this stone were decorated. On these narrow but plain and smooth joint surfaces geometrical designs had been picked: facing the entrance, we have a series of 9 inverted alternating boxed chevrons and on the opposite side, 9 pairs of single opposed chevrons. Seen from underneath, both ends of the stone show the remains of a deep rounded gully parallel to the edge, which had been carefully picked over and secondarily damaged by crude flaking, presumably to adjust the slab to the width of the passage. The lower surface itself has been flattened by crude hammering which partly obliterated an earlier finely picked surface; on the remaining areas, several straight lines carefully grooved are still visible but no intelligible composition can any longer be read (PI. 4b). The history of this stone thus appears very complex and from the gullies we can infer that it previously belonged to some rather sophisticated structure, the nature of which remains conjectural. Perhaps we could, nevertheless, suggest a comparison with the coffres a rainures well known in the Armorican Bronze Age and which are classically considered as the execution in stone of carpentry assemblages. Though proofs are missing, why not imagine this tradition as rooted as far back as Middle Neolithic times, the size of the slab being actually convenient to form one of the side stones in such a stone coffin ? e - R.S. 10 has an almost perfectly flat lower surface which forms the ceiling of the chamber. Engaged in the cairn, the upper face has been cleared during the excavations, revealing a stone trapezoidal in shape, of about 3.7x3.1x3.6x2.5m with clear traces of man-made breaks on the two opposite major sides (resting on the lateral walls of the chamber). Although transversely carinated, this surface is impressively decorated; over some scattered cupmarks a few centimetres in diameter and a small, psi-shaped, horned sign, the two major elements are: - a huge axe-plough (or Mane-Rutual type axe according to the terminology of Shee-Twohig (1981). More than 3m long when intact, this device (of uncertain significance as we have yet seen above) is quite typical but, among the half-dozen known specimens, it curiously appears almost identical with the only one comparable</page><page sequence="8">86 CHARLES-TANGUY LE ROUX in size, which appears on the central fragment of the Grand-menhir of Locmariaquer: the proximal appendix of the handle has the same symmetrical bow-shaped aspect and the cutting edge of the sub-rectangular blade is notched exactly in the same way. The dorsal loop and distal part of the handle are clearly cut by the north-eastern break in the slab. A great zoomorphic representation, more than 2m long, is represented by its left profile in the central part of the surface. Up to now, it appears to be without any true equivalent in Armorican megalithic art, despite the doubtful identifications claimed by Le Rouzic on the lower part of the Mane-er-Hroeg (Pequart and Le Rouzic 1927, 20, pi. 24) and recently by P.R. Giot on the Menhir of St Samson near Dinan in north-eastern Brittany (Giot 1986). The horns, clearly represented over-large (about lm long), are also the most carefully treated parts of the figure; for most of their length they are parallel and regularly curved backwards but they elegantly diverge at their ends. Comparatively, the body, about 1.4m long from head to rump, is rather crude; breast, head and spine are clearly drawn but belly, legs and tail appear unfinished (although possibly damaged by an ancient fault in the rock). Nevertheless, the animal can be identified as a bovid (and probably a female) from significant details: the bearing of the head, straight spine, angular rump and thin conical double curved horns (PI. CI). Parallel to the south-western edge of the stone runs a gully about lm long, bent at both ends and again cut by the break, while further north, two large boxed arches emerge from the same break. These two elements clearly represent the spine and horns of a second bovid; let us just recall here that the missing part has been identified with the "quadruped" described on the ceiling of La Table-des-Marchands at Locmariaquer (de Closmadeuc 1895), about 4km westwards, the reconstitution proposed on the basis of this discovery could lead to a second grand-menhir about 14m high (Le Roux 1984). 3 - Pre-existing Motifs included in the main ornamentation On several panels, among the exuberant arc-style, we can discern remains, more or less intimately incorporated, of a more classical passage tomb style art. a - L5 is one of the stones on which Shee-Twohig founded her distinction of two styles at Gavrinis; effectively, we can recognize there (PI. 3): - a massive crook on top left; the pole, which is clearly countercurved, appears surprisingly short and engaged in a spiral motif which might well have obliterated its end. - a wide pendant arc, hanging from the two upper corners of the slab is represented by a picked line, much more tenuous than the surrounding decoration, which nevertheless seems organized around it. - a sub-rectangular area at bottom right is also delimited by a relatively light contour; it is surmounted by a small semi-circle: Shee-Twohig rightly placed this among the rectangular buckler signs as represented at Petit-Mont, Mane-Kerioned, Mane-Lud, etc. Complementing this, let us notice how the inner system of boxed U-lines is to be compared, at the scale of the whole slab, with the pendant line mentioned above. Nevertheless, identification of this stone as a former buckler stele decorated with pendant crook and bucklers (a second one, filled with chevrons, may be vaguely discerned at bottom left) remains much more conjectural than in the case of C5 discussed above, although the display presented would not be incongruous in this perspective. Unfortunately, as the top of the stone is engaged in the structure of the monument, we cannot see if an eventual "cephalic" outgrowth has been cut off or not.</page><page sequence="9">THE ART OF GAVRINIS 87 b - On the upper part of C2, a small sub-rectangular cartouche (c. 0.25 x 0.3m) protrudes about 1cm above the rest of the surface. It appears to have also been regularized by hammering and we can see on it two vertical parallel gullies picked more crudely than the other elements of the decoration. This might well be the ultimate remains of a primary decorated surface, elsewhere rubbed away by a general reworking of the stone. In such a hypothesis, we should have here an interesting indication about the working strategy of the neolithic artist, who seemingly advanced his work steadily, step by step, more or less in an ant's way. 4 - The problem of the individualized signs In the ornamentation of Gavrinis, some motifs curiously appear perfectly individualized among the abounding lines around, which may suggest a possible anteriority. These motifs are often (but not always) of sophisticated execution (the technical criteria proposed by Shee-Twohig (1981, 49) to define her Styles 1 and 2 in the light of the recent discoveries presented above, no longer appear chronogically so relevant as could be formerly supposed). a - Polished stone axe blades, which are by far the main concerned motifs, appear on many stones : - L6 (2 associated with a bow, 1 alone; - L9 (the famous 19 axe panel; Plate C2); - L10 (2 blades opposed by their butts); - R6 (1 linked to a buckler, 2 blades and 1 hafted framing snake-like signs); - RIO (a group of 4 blades); - C3 ( a group of 2). These motifs have long been commonly compared with the famous jadeite parade axes found in the graves sealed under the giant Carnac-type barrows. These low relief representations have indeed the same elongated triangular shape with pointed butt, sometimes a clearly widened cutting edge and even, sometimes, a small cupmark at the very place where some actual axes are perforated. But this comparison, although it remains typologically justified, is no longer to be considered as an argument of late age as it was when the widened edge was supposed to be an imitation of the first metal flat axes. Nowadays, the few available radiocarbon dates available for Carnac-type barrows converge with archaeological considerations to place these implements in the middle Neolithic, probably in the second half of the 5th millennium bc. On three slabs at least (L9, L10, RIO) and to a less degree on C3, axe blades are grouped on well-delimited panels which seem to govern the organization of the surrounding decoration. But on L6 and R8, they are part of a composition which by itself asks a question. On L6, two blades are placed head to foot beside a realistic and sophisticated representation of a bow with elegant double bend at each end, itself associated with two arrows. The whole composition appears to be in a significant place on the foreside of a slab which slightly protrudes into the passage and is thus distinguishable from the entrance. The two other examples of a bow in Breton megalithic tombs (at Ile-Longue, Morbihan, and Barnenez, Finistere), although much simpler, also occur in a more or less similar situation. In Barnenez H, the bow is also associated with axe blades on the most visible face of a pillar-shaped jambstone which is in a septal situation between the two successive chambers; it is probably a re-used stele as some of the signs are at present facing the wall. This situation is itself to be compared with the truncated stele decorated</page><page sequence="10">88 CHARLES-TANGUY LE ROUX with an axe-plough between the two areas of the double chamber at Mane-Rutual in Locmariaquer. In the lower part of R8, the axes are associated with serpentiform lines but nothing permits any conclusion about chronology relative to the art of the upper register (PL C3). About these serpentiforms, let us keep in mind that, unlike Ireland, there are actually living snakes in Brittany, where they still feed a rich folk mythology, as they probably already did even in Neolithic times. Nevertheless, among the quantity of wavy lines visible in Brittany only few are clearly snake-shaped and the cases of clearly indicated heads, either ovoid as on colubridae or sub-triangular as on viperidae, are almost limited to Gavrinis and the Manio standing stone. Even the second stone to be clearly concerned in Gavrinis (R4 on the left) is much less clear on this point. The axes of L6 and the upper part of R8 are too intimately linked with the surrounding decoration to argue for an independent execution; nevertheless, their typology and technique appear quite similar; so the argument about which comes earlier is not absolute and, in any case, the chronological difference between the two phases of decoration is probably not very great. II The True Gavrinis Arc-Style The omnipresent exuberance of "the curves, the straight or broken lines traced in a hundred different ways" which confused the General Inspector of Historical Monuments and Man of Letters Prosper Merimee on his first visit to the monument (Merimee 1836), remains a major impression for most of today's visitors. This abundance can nevertheless be widely decoded by comparison with the basic ornamental repertory of the early Armorican passage tomb art, as presented for instance by Shee-Twohig (1981, fig. 3), or Le Roux (1985, figs. 27 - 32) and many others. 1 - The buckler sign This has long since been recognized as fundamental and its value has progressively been interpreted as an ultimate avatar of the great mother-goddess, well-known in the first neolithic cultures in the Near East and the Balkans, although no clear female sexual attributes ever appear on the Armorican buckler. But this explanation may not be ruled out as from a survey of Neolithic Europe there emerge two series of female idols. The principal one concerns well-modelled figurines with wide hips and a full-breasted chest framing a neat waist. By contrast, other figurines are very squat and either clay-contoured tablets as in Romania (Vadastra, etc.), ceramic jar-idols or solid statues (Lepenski Vir, etc.). Both traditions seem represented in the French Middle Neolithic of Chassean influence (Blanchet 1990). The first one appears in the clay figurines from the north of the Paris basin and the second one through the amazing sandstone statuette from Capdenac-le-haut in South-western France, the silhouette of which is not very different from the Armorican bucklers. The most accomplished example of these bucklers is certainly to be seen in the passage tomb of Ile-Longue, neighbouring Gavrinis in the Golfe du Morbihan. The attributes completing the "body" of the principal one are there complete: a cephalic tip, two shoulder notches, two side loops and hairy lines radiating from the upper part of the motif. In the many examples attested in Brittany the central cartouche can vary in shape from nearly square to almost triangular; the other motifs in the tomb of Ile-Longue itself give a fair impression of this range.</page><page sequence="11">THE ART OF GAVRINIS 89 ^d^'M^^B^m *' ''' '*'''' ' ' ' -^1 'i jJKrfB^^^^^^B PI.

They are sometimes rather slender (L6 on the right, Lll on top, fig. 14) but most of them are semi-circular, which may explain why they are not always clearly distinguishable from boxed U and arcs in the descriptions given by Shee-Twohig, although they often have a tip, radiating lines or side-loops (and even sometimes several of these attributes at once). An interesting variety, at the bottom of R9, has loops pushed upwards in a "Mickey Mouse's ears" fashion (PI. C4). Such a disposition is also visible at Kermaillard, Sarzeau, and overall in the angled passage tomb of Goerem, Gavres (L'Helgouach 1970) where it can be considered as transitional towards the late Pierres-plates style bucklers. Most of the identifiable bucklers in Gavrinis are covered internally with concentric lines, or high-lighted by external extra contours, or both. These graphic treatments apparently follow rather precise rules which curiously may recall those postulated by the "Optical art" school in recent years. But sometimes, bucklers seem to command a more complex organization. 2 - Bucklers with associated signs Let us emphazize two examples which seem especially meaningful: a - On the right of R8, the upper part of a buckler is surrounded by well-developed "radiating hairs" which include, on the left, a crook and, on the right, a triangular axe-blade (Fig. 16, PL C3). These two ancillary symbols, which may be considered as symbols of power (Cassen and L'Helgouach 1992; Le Roux 1992), are here placed as if they were considered as attributes of the central buckler. b - On the top of C3, an ogival buckler (the base of which is not clearly defined) is engaged among a series of sub-parallel lines which can be considered as "radiating hairs" but, on both sides, they progressively turn into diverging crooks very similar to those already discussed on C5. Here too, the buckler appears in a central position among these symbols of power (PI. 5b). 3 - Boxed bucklers In the early neolithic (and later) cultures of Central Europe, the Balkans and Near East, where the mother-goddess is the focus of a rich and realistic iconography, a great variety of female figurines are twinned, often in a "Siamese sisters" way (two heads for a single body); they can be considered as the representation of a mother-daughter divine couple. Their true equivalent is not developed in western neolithic art but, in Gavrinis, several compositions seem to relate to such a symbol (which will later develop in a totally different way in the art of some Allees-couvertes). a - L4 is certainly the clearest example of twinned idols; the lower part of the decorated surface is covered by a large semi-circular buckler with side loops and upper tip. The inner surface of the cartouche is covered in the usual way by concentric lines while the loops greatly expand in extra contours. Around the tip, an identical expansion shows, on top, a second tip while, on both sides, a second pair of loops develop, as if the expanded tip had became the body of a second buckler. b - The centre of R9 shows a tipped buckler; here too, the outer expansion line draws a subsidiary expansion which can be considered as a secondary tip, again dilated but, here, the relations with the side-loops are not so clear, the composition of the whole panel being rather rigidly divided into almost independent panels (PI. C4).</page><page sequence="20">98 CHARLES-TANGUY LE ROUX c - The upper face of the sillstone has four main semicircular motifs; on the right, two of them are superposed as before but, on the left, the two others, of unequal size, are set closely side by side, directly suggesting the classical "siamese idols" we referred to above. But how far can we push this interpretation? This question is especially crucial on stones R8 and R9 where, beside the main motifs, we can observe garlands of miniature superposed bucklers. It would be hazardous to suggest so long a filiation (up to the ninth degree for the right edge of R9!); it seems more reasonable to consider these subsidiary signs as mainly ornamental. Such a point of view seems to agree with the general exuberance of the compositions concerned. 4 - Other signs a - The yoke or horned U. We have already encountered this motif (which was not clearly distinguished from the normal U or the arc by Shee-Twohig) in a secondary position on RS2. We again find this motif included in several wavy compositions without any clear temporal relationship, for instance on C2 (Fig. 15, PI. 6 on top right) and C3, where small groups are closely boxed together (which is a typical organization already known in early passage tombs such as Barnenez A, Mane-Lud, etc.). Here, the close interlocking with the surrounding worm-like decoration is nevertheless an argument for realization in a single step. b - The true U signs. On several stones, we can notice a proliferation of boxed half-circles which neither seem relevant to any ghost-buckler nor always easy to distinguish from the yokes despite the absence of terminal diverging curves. The concavity may be upwards, downwards or lateral. Some mirror groups also exist, on both sides of a horizontal line (L8, L10, R6, C2) which formerly have sometimes been hastily considered as spirals (but the tracing is never continuous from one side to the other of the mirror line (Fig. 16, PI. 1)). c - Spirals. Although not so common as has sometimes been claimed, they are not absent from Gavrinis, which is almost the only Armorican monument to present indisputable examples. L5 shows the only true spiral, with a single strand on slightly more than five turns counter-clockwise before merging into the stem of the crook mentioned above (Fig. 14). CI and C2 have, in their lower parts, spirals with opposed double wrapping; the simplest, on the right of CI, turns soon in a series of boxed keyhole-shaped concentric lines. Its neighbour on the left associates, in slightly more than two turns, a simple ribbon (rim between two adjacent gullies) and a double one (wider, with an axial gully). The third example, on C2, has moreover an intermediate double ribbon (Fig. 15). d - Chevrons. These are also present on fine surfaces, executed in a quite different technique from the recycled examples already discussed and always organized in vertical compositions. They appear especially on L5 (bottom left), on L6 (a long and narrow ribbon aside the string of the bow, fig. 14), on L9 (a diffuse area more or less in "hungarian stitch" design on the right part), on Lll (a rather floppy undulation on the chamber side, more vigorously designed towards the passage), on RIO (again a hungarian stitch panel expanding from two vigorous bands). On the one hand, we can notice (once the style of execution is set apart) the relative similarity between the L5 panel and the side of L10, but also the close association of the ribbon of L6 with the bow and arrow group, already mentioned as possibly ancient. But, on the other hand, there is a close link on Lll between the chevron motif and</page><page sequence="21">THE ART OF GAVRINIS 99 *\v^^K- ?'* 11 $t 'v' a list if^Mti^ft lI^^^^^^^^^^B PI.

But, save perhaps on R5, we do not really observe in Gavrinis wide drapery-like surfaces as they occur in the late crypt of Le Petit-Mont C of Arzon (Lecornec 1985; 1987). Ill - Some Elements of Comparison 1 - In Armorica At the end of this review, we observe only minor revisions from the comparative switchboard proposed some twelve years ago by Shee-Twohig (1981, 55 - 57). With the exception of the spirals and, to a lesser degree, the chevrons, almost no components of the Gavrinis style appear truly foreign to the ancient repertoire of the Armorican single-chambered passage tombs. The key originality lies in the way these basic motifs are graphically treated and arranged in much more sophisticated compositions than anywhere in Brittany. On some panels, the exuberant tracing takes place in very strict frames (for instance on R9); let us remember here the comparisons made formerly by the famous cubist painter Albert Gleizes with the art of the Italian primitives such as Cimabue, Daddi and others with their compositions presenting a central scene framed by subsidiary ones at the side and resting on a lower transverse band composition (Gleizes 1932; Tapie and Alibertl985). But on other stones, the construction is much more lax and even can suggest in places psychedelic art or even, here and there, hallucinatory or psychotic expressions (although the execution remains of a great reliability, which means time-consuming realization, consistency in the inspiration and sure hand, all points which are not easily compatible, with an execution in a second estate). Actually, a permanent horror vacui appears as a major component of this art and we suggest that it could be defined as a baroque explosion of the classical, severe Armorican passage tomb art, if we dare make comparisons with other artistic adventures such as the classical 18th century baroque, but also early mediaeval Viking art and La Tene protohistoric art (including its famous Irish Christian developments), to limit our investigation to the European repertoire. In such a perspective, it becomes vain to push the analysis too far and force a first degree reading for each component of each panel. In the more sophisticated ones there are signs which, although typologically identifiable (like the small subsidiary bucklers of R9), clearly act mainly as emphasizers for the neighbouring major motifs. This should be still more valid in the case of lines apparently undecipherable (such as on L6, L7, L9). We do not know if this was purely formal and aesthetic or if, as it was more or less the case in the other exuberant arts first proposed for comparison, and as we suggested above for the buckler attributes, these subsidiary signs gave a complement of power to the major ones or acquired a secondary meaning by themselves in such a situation. Perhaps the aim of the prehistoric artist was totally different and inaccessible to our twentieth century meaning! 2 - And what about Ireland ? As we recalled in our introduction, many comparisons have been proposed between Gavrinis and the great ornamented passage tombs of Ireland, especially the other emblematic site of Newgrange. Some of them were fed by the myths of romantic celtomania and need not detain us here. But others, more seriously argued (for instance</page><page sequence="24">} . . : 5?r ^ Fig. 14 Gavrinis surveys by E.

Breuil), appear archaeologically credible at a first glance. In their time, they certainly were attractive in a general diffusionist ambience and in a context of still uncertain chronology. Without reviewing all the rich ornamental repertoire of the Irish megaliths, as it has been summarized by M. Herity (1974, fig. 81) or by Shee-Twohig (1981,106 -115) and developed for Newgrange (O'Kelly, 1982) or Knowth (Eogan 1986), let us focus our attention on a few major points. a - The spiral. As we have seen, it is exceptional in Gavrinis; by contrast, it is a major component of the Boyne art, where it is governed by rules of construction different from the Breton ones: there is no opposed double wrapping in Ireland but we commonly find there double or triple spiral assemblages of single wrappings (which never occur in Brittany). b - The circular motifs. Either concentric, radiating, lobed or hybrid, they are another basic element of Irish art again almost missing in Brittany (save the few examples of "bicycle wheel" in Le-Petit-Mont and the more doubtful "sunny cupmark" of La Table-des-Marchands). The contrast is even stronger with the checkers, either with triangular or lozenge picked boxes. They are totally unknown in Brittany, c - The boxed arcs are common in both countries and thus focus the attention, giving a family touch to some panels. But we have seen how, in Gavrinis, they often result from a very specific treatment of perfectly defined basic signs. These do not exist in Ireland and, even on a very Breton-looking stone such as Newgrange K52 (O'Kelly 1974, 158), the arcs develop around boxed rectangles with cupmarks and triangles totally foreign to Armorican inspiration. d - The graphic game of filling / dilation of elementary motifs by multiplication of lines is limited to Gavrinis (and, at a lesser degree, to a few stones of Le Petit-Mont) in Brittany. It seems more common in Ireland where it is applied to arcs but also to lozenges (at Fourknocks), to circles (at Sess Kilgreen), to lobed circles (with an extreme development on the ceiling of the east side-chamber at Newgrange; O'Kelly 1982, 181). But here too, the rules of construction differ; for instance, a complex Irish panel can be included as a whole in a line emerging from one of its elementary components (the spirals of the Newgrange sillstone). This never occurs in Brittany. Such a point seems much more than anecdotal as it denotes a basic difference in the perception of both the whole and the parts. 3 - Conclusions This brief survey leads us to considerably relativize what could have been claimed about affinities between the parietal art of our major monuments, and this does not appear surprising. The two countries concerned are rather distant and, even if the sea is rightly considered as a link rather than an obstacle, their relations, especially direct ones, would have been few in Neolithic times as they implied a long sailing far off the coasts, in an often rough open sea, with still rather simple canoes (things which seriously change in the Bronze Age). The differences between the supporting architectures and their associated cultures also denote a very large autonomy even if a common source for general ideas is undeniable. But a conclusive argument may lie in the chronological data now available for both countries. We have only a circumstantial argument to date the building of Gavrinis: some flakes of Type A dolerite were found in the thin brown old soil under the front wall of the cairn. The stone axe factory of Plussulien, from which this rock comes, fed a considerable production</page><page sequence="28">106 CHARLES-TANGUY LE ROUX in the fourth and third millennia bc but no traces of its activity have been proved before 3900 bc (Delibrias and Le Roux 1974; Le Roux 1984). The date of building has also to be discussed in connection with the data of the recent excavations at Locmariaquer, as we have seen how the covering slab of the Gavrinis chamber has been cut from the same stone as its equivalent at the Table-des-Marchands. All the dates available up to this day for this latter passage tomb but also for the associated Er-Grah long barrow and the underlying traces of habitation fit, once calibrated, in a narrow fourchette of a few centuries around 4000 bc or slightly later (Le Roux et al, unpublished; L'Helgouach, pers. comm.). On the other hand, the blocking up of Gavrinis probably fits with the end of about one millennium of great megalithic activity in Morbihan. It was immediately preceded by the fire of light wooden structures built in front of the facade; remains of a charred post could be dated (GIF 5766 : 4470 + 80 BP). According to Pearson et al. (1986), the corresponding calibrated bracket would be towards 3340 - 3040 bc. The life of Gavrinis appears thus to have been certainly clearly less than a millennium and perhaps no more than a few centuries. In the Boyne area, the six dates clearly connected with the great architecture of Knowth and Newgrange are all later than 4500 BP and, after calibration, fall into the bracket 3400 - 2900 bc (Eogan 1986). We still lack information about the Loughcrew complex and older dates are available for other Irish megaliths but for the emergence and development of a great artistic school such as the Boyne one certainly supposes a strong dynamic which means a rather quick evolution. In other words, it is difficult to imagine an art closely comparable to Newgrange already developed several centuries earlier and going on without major change. This is precisely what occurred in Brittany, where the Gavrinis style appears as a magnificent but without next day achievement of the long maturation which started early in the fifth millennium bc in simple chambered passage tombs such as Barnenez or Guennoc (Giot 1987). Let us remember that a second parallel achievement leads, a bit later, to the Pierres-plates style closely linked with the emergence of the angled tomb architecture in the south Armorican coastal area. Chronologically speaking, this Pierres-plates style would be a better parallel to the Boyne art than the Gavrinis style, which is a bit too old; but the inspiration is different, apparently more influenced by the south French Late Neolithic / Chalcolithic cultural context. However, to develop this would be an other story. In conclusion, it apparently has been as difficult for the serpentiform lines of Gavrinis to conquer Irish megaliths as for actual snakes to settle on the island of St Patrick!
