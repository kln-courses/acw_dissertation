ADAMSON CONSANGUINOUS marriages are often mentioned in historical and literary texts, as well as in mythologies from the ancient Middle East. They are also found among the Inca dynasty of Peru in the New World. It is proposed to consider certain aspects of these marriages in countries of the ancient Near East and in ancient Greece only. Mesopotamia. Although the ancient cuneiform texts are unfortunately both scanty and badly preserved, we do know that consanguinous marriages were consummated by the deities of ancient Mesopotamia. The great god Enlil committed incest with his mother Ki in order to create life on earth,' and his colleague Enki cohabited with the goddesses Ninmu, Ninkurra and Uttu, who were respectively his daughter, grand-daughter and great-grand-daughter.2 The god Ninurta cohabited with his mother Gula, and normal children resulted from this union. He also had incestuous relationships with his sister Ninudzalli and half-sister Nintulla. The god Tammuz was consort of his sister IMtar. No children were born from these latter unions. It is known that Ninurta was assimilated to the gods Ningirsu and Enlil. All Sumerian deities were anthropomorphic. These Sumerian myths are known from written records dated to the early part of the third millenium B:C., but were probably passed down in oral tradition from much earlier times. These deities had a wide following throughout Mesopotamia for many centuries, and certainly continued to be worshipped there at least until the time of the Persian Empire in the 6th century B.C. Egypt. Consanguinous marriages were also celebrated among the deities of ancient Egypt. The god Shu married his sister Tefnut who gave birth to the twins Geb and Nut. They in turn married and had five normal children. Of considerable importance were the incestuous relationships between Osiris and his sister Isis, and between Set and his sister Nephthys. The Osiris myth was certainly known by the time of the first dynasty of Egypt (c.3000 B.C.),' for Horus, son of Isis and Osiris, was worshipped by tribes in Egypt at that time, while Set was worshipped in an area of Upper Egypt adjacent to the Wadi el Hammamat, one of the principal routes used for trading with ports on the Red Sea.4 It is significant that Horus was soon assimilated to the sun-god Re'. The pharoah was considered to be divine, and funerary boats associated with the graves of the early pharaohs at Sakkara clearly show that even the first pharaoh, Hor-aha,must have accompanied other celestial gods in their journey in a solar boat across the heavens.5 Early records of the pharaohs are incomplete; nevertheless it appears probable that the marriages of the pharaohs of the first and second dynasties were made for political reasons and were not consanguinous, but by the time of the fourth dynasty (c.2600 B.C.) we are informed that consanguinous marriages were being</page><page sequence="2">86 P. B. ADAMSON celebrated in Egypt (see Table 1). From this time written records became more numerous and therefore we have more information concerning the pharaohs and their wives. It has been pointed out previously that no case of full brother-sister marriage could be proved to have taken place in pharaonic marriages.6 Nevertheless incestuous unions between father and daughter did occur, and there is one reported case of incest between mother and son (see Table 1). After the conquest of the Ancient World by Alexander the Great, all ruling dynasties of the conquered countries ceased to exist, but after his death in 323 B.C. the separate states acquired by his successors once more instigated consanguinous marriages among the ruling classes only. It is significant however, that Alexander had officially been recognised as king of Egypt during his lifetime, having been deified as Son of Amon-Re'.' His successors in Egypt were the Ptolemids; they too were deified, both king and his consort being worshipped as 'brother-sister' gods (see Table 2). Persia. With the conquest of Mesopotamia and the further expansion of the Persian Empire to include Egypt within its boundaries, the Persian kings came into direct contact with religious thought in both these countries by the latter part of the 6th century B.C. Persian religious practice was derived neither from the old Sumerian pantheon nor from the ancient Egyptian deities, but the Persian kings did respect the forms of ancient worship which were practised by their Egyptian and Mesopotamian subjects. Consanguinous marriages were permitted among the ruling class, and certainly were celebrated by the kings at the Persian court (see Table 3). Asia Minor. Consanguinous marriage was not uncommon in early Hebrew records, but incest was contrary to the Mosaic law.8 The incest of Lot with his two daughters was apparently condoned for reasons of inheritance.9 In Caria it was the custom to have marriages between brothers and sisters,"1 but Caria was incorporated into the empire of the Seleucids after the death of Alexander. These rulers, unlike the Carians, were worshipped as divine and their sister consorts also shared in these honours (see Table 4). Greece. Greek mythology has numerous references to incest among the gods of Olympus (see Table 5), and it is possible to compare the results of these incestuous unions with those from non-incestuous marriages (see Table 6). According to Homer, the gods on Olympus assisted the heroes of the Trojan War which may be dated to c. 1200 B.C., but many of the Greek deities were already firmly established in the Mycenaean Age of the 16-12th centuries B.C., and they may have originated from oriental sources." Even as early as the 1-2nd dynasties there was trade between Egypt and Crete, but its volume markedly increased in the Mycenaean age.12 Direct contacts between mainland Greece, the coastal regions of Asia Minor and Egypt were also close during this latter period. There was always a strong tendency towards syncretism in Greek religion and this was particularly noticeable during the XXVIth dynasty in Egypt, when Greek deities assimilated those of Egypt. The conquest of all the countries bordering on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean was completed by the Romans towards the end of the 1st century B.C., and all forms of consanguinous marriage were then suppressed. The Greek gods were assimilated by the Roman deities, but incest and other forms of antisocial behaviour of deities were condemned by the Romans, until finally the rule of law forbad everyone who was a Roman citizen from marrying within the</page><page sequence="3">CONSANGUINOUS MARRIAGES 87 prohibited degrees of consanguinity.'3 Discussion. Consanguinous marriage was widely practised in most countries of the ancient Near East. Incest, being union between brother and sister, father and daughter, or mother and son in particular, apparently was not permitted among the general population in these countries,and was usually forbidden by law.'4 Among deities, however, incest was quite frequent and accepted as normal by worshippers of the gods. Although the early kings of Sumer may have acquired divine status during their lifetime, this was a result of celebrating the rites of the 'Sacred Marriage' in connection with the New Year festival. There is no suggestion that the king was in fact considered to be truly divine, and deification of kings soon ceased after the end of the Ur III dynasty (c.2010 B.C.). During the second millenium the Hittite kings were considered to be intermediaries between gods and men; although they were regularly deified after death, they were never worshipped during their lives." As far as is known from the relatively few records that have been preserved for posterity, consanguinous marriages were not permitted by the Hittites, incest being severely punished by law.'6 Among the ancient Israelites, the king was never considered to be divine. It is suggested that the practice of incest among deities must have originated in Mesopotamia, and was then adopted by the gods of the predynastic inhabitants of Upper Egypt. Cultural and trade connections between Egypt and Mesopotamia are known to have taken place even before the 1st dynasty was founded, although to what extent Egypt had been influenced by Mesopotamia still has not been decided.'" The trading ventures from Sumer almost certainly were sea-borne.'8 However early Egyptian religious thought certainly was strongly influenced by Sumerian concepts.'9 For purposes of the present argument it will be sufficient to consider the god Horus. The worship of Horus was that of a celestial cult, which was soon assimilated to that of the sun-god Re'. Worship of the sun-god was probably firmly established in Lower Egypt before unification of the country had been fully achieved by the end of the 1st dynasty.20 Utu, the sun-god of Sumer, was often considered to be the son of Enlil, and like his Egyptian counterpart, also travelled in a boat through the Underworld at night in order to rise every day from mountains in the East. It is probable therefore that solar worship in Egypt may have been influenced by cult practices from Sumer. In this connection, it may be significant that the principal cult centre for Enlil was at Nippur, and those for Utu at Ur, Larsa and Sippar, all of which were important trading centres, being conveniently situated adjacent to navigable waterways. Both Egyptian religions were likewise thoroughly impregnated with magical practices, and amulets became popular as protection against evil influences.21 All Sumerian deities were anthropomorphic, whereas those of Egypt, with the exception of the god Ptah who may have been a deified man, were hybrids, being represented either as animals or in human form with animal or bird heads. It is probable that these therianthropic forms represent a more primitive stage of religious development than the anthropomorphic ones. These early Sumerian traders may have been the 'Dominant Race' who invaded and conquered the predynastic Egyptians. It may therefore be significant that the Sumerians, represented in art, were Brachycephalic,22 having skulls of similar shape to those of the 'dynastic race' in Egypt.23 Incestuous unions among the pharaohs of ensuing dynasties can be considered as an extension of the custom among the deities; for the pharaohs themselves</page><page sequence="4">88 P. B. ADAMSON were considered to be divine by their own subjects. Naturally, this form of marriage tended to secure the continuance of the ruling dynasty, provided that the children born from such marriages were normal. From the available records, which certainly are incomplete and may be biased, children of these consanguinous marriages appear to have been normal. We are not informed however, about the disposal of unwanted infants. The Ptolemids, successors to the pharaohs, were also considered to be deities and descendants of earlier dynastic divinities of the pharaohs.24 Marriage between full brothers and sisters was permitted by the Egyptians, although it is impossible to estimate how frequently it actually occurred in practice.25 It was modelled on the divine marriage between Isis and Osiris, and therefore had the blessing of the priesthood for its legality. The Seleucids, contemporaries of the Ptolemeid dynasty in Egypt, also had male and female divinities in the ruling line, kings being deified during life and worshipped as gods by their subjects. It is likely that they were inflenced partly from Egyptian sources, but may also have derived their divinity mainly from the god Apollo of the Greeks. The consanguinous marriages of the Persian kings were fundamentally different from those of the Egyptians, for Persian kings were always considered to be human. Nevertheless, policy dictated that Persian kings who visited Egypt as conquerors should conform to ancient Egyptian religious custom and thereby become affiliated to the gods of Egypt. Thus, they too became legitimate successors to the pharaohs.26 This policy was not pursued by the later Persian kings, who often deliberately violated Egyptian religious principles, never visited Egypt at all, and by their ineffectual, corrupt rule, provided willing Egyptian allies for the forces of Alexander the Great. Persian incestuous unions may however have originated from Egyptian religious influences. It had been accepted that Persian nobility consorted with their mothers, but it is doubtful if this practice was at all common. Indeed, the statements of the ancient authorities are suspect, and may only refer to the incestuous unions within the ruling royal family.27 The Greek deities may have originated in Asia Minor or even further East, but there were also strong religious ties with Crete and with Egypt as early as the middle of the second millenium B.C. The kings of Greek states were always considered to be human, although often boasting of a divine ancestor who had founded the ruling dynasty. Incest was permitted among their gods but was unacceptable among humans. This is clearly demonstrated by the punishment meted out to Oedipus, even when he had committed the crime unwittingly.28 However, marriage with half-sisters was permitted under Greek Law, but probably was uncommon in practice. Unions between full brothers and sisters were forbidden.29 As syncretism was always a marked feature of Greek religion, it is considered most probable that religious concepts from Egypt had influenced the social habits of Greek divinities. The Greek gods show a marked preponderance of male births in normal and incestuous unions (see Tables 5 and 6). No significant difference was found between normal and incestuous births of the gods Zeus and Poseidon for multiple births or abnormalities, but the number of incestuous unions was relatively few. Divine incest therefore did not apparently lead to an increase of abnormal children, a conclusion which might have been expected, since it would have been degrading to the gods to suggest otherwise.</page><page sequence="5">CONSANGUINOUS MARRIAGES 89 Conclusions. In the countries of the ancient Near East, incest among deities was considered to be right and proper, but was not permitted among humans. The concept of divine incest most probably originated in southern Mesopotamia not later than the beginning of the third millenium B.C. and probably considerably earlier. It was then brought by Sumerian traders to Egypt in predynastic times. It was accepted by the rulers of Upper and Lower Egypt and finally by the majority of the indigenous population. Consanguinous marriages of the pharaonic dynasties were sanctified by priests of Re', and accepted by commoners, because the pharaoh was considered to be a god. The religious institution of incestuous marriage was firmly established by the IVth dynasty and continued in practice until the dynasty of the Ptolemies was overthrown by the power of Rome towards the end of the 1st century B.C. Incestuous marriage also found favour in other countries of the Middle East. Both the Seleucids and the Persian kings certainly permitted incestuous unions at their courts, being influenced by religious practices from Egypt. These kings were considered to be divine and therefore incest could be officially approved by the priesthood. Only in the case of the late Persian kings does this religious aspect break down, but by then the Persian court had become totally corrupt, and was soon to be overtfirown by Alexander. In Greece, similar Egyptian influences were at work as early as the middle of the second millenium B.C. Incest was permitted among the gods, but was a criminal offence for their worshippers, although marriage between brothers and half-sisters was permitted. Incest by Greek kings was never permitted, because the king was not considered to be divine. When Greece and Egypt were absorbed into the expanding Roman Empire, all forms of consanguinous marriage were abolished, and the degrees of kindred within which it was prohibited to marry were clearly stated in the laws.30 6 Crag Lane, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire.
