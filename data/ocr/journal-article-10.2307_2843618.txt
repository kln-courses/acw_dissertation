<plain_text><page sequence="1">385 A COMPARISON OF DRAWINGS FROM ANCIENT EGYPT, LIBYA, AND THE SOUTH SPANISH CAVES. By E. S. THOMAS. IT is generally agreed that the Mesolithic Tardenoisian culture of Europe had its parallel, if not its origin, in the Upper Capsian of North Africa. To this period, or to the Early Neolithic, the Spanish Cave Art under consideration belongs. No pictorial remains other than drawings scratched on rocks have hitherto been discovered in Libya, or indeed North Africa. This may be due to the comparatively small amount of study which has been as yet devoted to the subject in North Africa. Btit, as Bulrkitt has remarked, Cave Art work of Early Man may yet be discovered in the limestone mountain districts of Morocco when political conditions render investigation possible. The route by which the Capsian culture passed into Europe must have been the ancient land-bridge subsequently severed by the Straits of Gibraltar. " Spain," says Obermaier, " was the route of immigration from Capsian Africa into France . . . Central and Southern Spain were absolutely under the influence of the Late Capsian of North Africa."l1 Cultural similarities do not necessarily imply connection as a general principle- in this case, of course, there is the geographical factor-but when culture and race are common to two separated areas, independent development is practically ruled out. At the period under consideration the Brown Race are already clearly in evidence in Spain and North Africa. Fig. 4 affords a small but striking confirmation of the a priori probability that at that period, presupposing the land-bridge, there were racial elements common to both littorals: the head-dresses 3, 6, and a, from'South Spain and Prehistoric Egypt, are identical. Examples 7 and b also have something in common, and 4 is perhaps comparable with the head of b in Fig. 6. A great number of the Spanish Cave designs have been shown Lby Obermaier2 to be conventionalized human figures. It wouLld be difficult, he says, to trace the derivation of these geometrically conventionalized designs of human and animal forms, were it not that we have a whole series of designs showing the -stages of evolution fronm realistic natural forms to the final geometrically conventional designs. Fig. 1 shows sequences of these compared with designs from the Mas d'Azil pebbles. 1 Fossil Man in Spain. 2 Op. cit. 2 D 2</page><page sequence="2">386 E. S. THOMAS.-A Comparison of Drawings from The head-forms are clearly representative of head-dresses (Fig. 1, D3 and 13, are perhaps type 3 of Fig. 4), and it is probable that the fringed neck, wrist, waist, and leg ornaments worn by the more realistic figures on the cave walls, as well as bow and arrows held across the body, account for the apparently redundant limbs of series L, M. Attention is called to the externalized eyes in F3, G3, and the development of the arrow-head in B3, F4 (Fig. 1). B HJ -~~~ __ Frbmr Ob] Zo .

A series of considerable interest. From Figs. 2 and 3 it will be seen that the hour-glass figure (e2 in this series) probably represents a Neolithic stone idol. A human figure is clearly represented by 3d2, clad in the Nubian (and Ancient Libyan) rahat or fringed-leather skirt. The series is further discussed below. 4. The e series represents stylized human forms. The rahat again appears under d2; c3 is stated by Petrie to be of Roman Age. 5. The design c is regarded as a primitive form of the hieroglyph khent (meaning "before," " in front of ") by Egyptologists, while 5e, like 4el, and probably le, is considered to be a stylized human sign, representing three figures. 6-9 (inclusive). The e series in each case is probably Palheolithic. These signs are usually regarded as representing traps or pitfalls. These gratings are so often 1 The Western Sudan Desert is included, as there are unmistakable signs of the early penetra- tion into Nubia by Libyans-probablv through the Egyptian Oases. 2 No Spanish publications were available for reference.

They are generally interpreted as traps or huts. al and bl, 2, suggest bodies in grave pits. 30. An interesting series of (mostly) straight-line animals. Compare b6, c, and el; b5 and d2.3 The next five series include, in column b, examples of Tunisian tatu designs.4 1 This trap seems to be intended in the well-known predynastic tomb-painting found at Hieraconpolis with deer encircling it. But this sun-like design may denote hair rolled up in a " bun " to the Ceylon Vedda, and " boys in the Nsibidi school-house " to the Ekoi of Southern Nigeria. 2 The general question of these plant designs is discussed below. d2 is from a Decorated vase- a boat standard. If these objects are cult images or svmbols, the flag-like neter sign is probably referable to this origin. 17d is also from a Decorated pot, and may be reasonably interpreted as a horn- or crescent-adorned image in origin. (See Fig. 2, series A and B, for development of stylized human q form.) 3 b2 and dl have both apparently double tails. The latter is explained in Fig. 6, a. The coincidence is curious. 4 From an article by D. E.

The Decorated pottery examp]e d2 recalls the carved peg-like predynastic figurines of Naqada.' d3 strongly suggests the " Wand of Jsis,"2 formed apparently of a palm branch clipped at intervals. The origin of the wand, and the point-to-base triangular pattern, seems thus to be the figurine or idol-form, to which el (if not 2 and 3) may also be referred. (See series 4 above.) 32. The externalized eyes in bl are noteworthy; also the trifurcated head (compare the Libyan rock design b3 and the pot-marks cl, r2, from Naqada) and pectinated arms of b2 and el, e2. To compare the arrow-head and cross-barred body of b2 with examples under d and e is perhaps barely permissible; but it is justifiable to regard the Tunisian designs as stylized human figures rather than trees (as M. Gobert does). 33. Perhaps the most interesting series of all; already referred to under 3, which is reinforced by the obviously human figure el, the Tunisian tatu b, and a striking example from an. Early Dynastic Egyptian copper adze.3 Petrie regards it as an early form of the ankh, sign of life, and compares it with the Tanit emblem with a round instead of triangular head. ITere are indications then connecting Tanit, goddess of Libya, and the ankh with the primitive Neolithic idols of Southern Spain, and pointing to the origin of the ankh being a figurine, and not a girdle, tie, or bow. Were the inter-resemblances shown above confined alone to designs of the fish-bone and of the triangle types, attention might justly be called, by critics, to the fact that the Solomon Islanders stylize the frigate bird, and the potters of Ancient Susa4 represented men and animals in these two ways respectively. But coincidences in some fifteen different types of design have been classed in Fig. 5, and, whatever the validity of the comparisons, the number of coincidences is sufficient to justify this paper and to save it from being ruled out on the score of independent development or " innate tendencies." But why, it may be asked, should the Early Egyptians have drawn such anthro- pometric designs on their pots ? Why, we may consider first, did the Spanish Cave Folk draw them on their walls ? Breuil has adduced reasons for regarding some categories of them as " inscriptions symboliques." They seem to have a social or tribal significance, representing apparently family groups-parents and children (see Fig. 7, e and Fig. 1, E3). I See Sir A. Evans, Huxley Mem. Lecture, Journ. Roy. Anth. Inst., iv, p. 216, where they are compared with Proto-Libyan and, more remotely, with figurines from Knossos. 2 A sculptured fragment described by Griffiths from Sanan, Nubia, with wlich lie connects a pot drawing identical to dl.

TEIOMAS.-A Comparison of Drawings from Obermaier's correlation of the stylized Cave drawings with the designs on the Mas d'Azil pebbles' has already been referred to (shown in Fig. 1). Quantities of these painted pebbles were found together in one place, some apparently deliberately broken, suggesting that they were, like Australian churinga, soul repositories, upon some of which an ill-disposed person had wreaked vengeance. It is at least feasible thus to suggest that the stylized human designs of these types were rank or tribal marks. Many of the drawings on the Libyan rocks are cut deep into the hard surface, sometimes granite, and it is hardly likely that the wielder of a primitive cutting- tool would go to so much trouble merely to leave his mark in the shape of an animal, anthropomorphic, or other design. There must have been an ulterior, 'if only magical, object which made it worth while. Turning to the drawings upon the Early Egyptian pottery, we are on different ground, as the decorative aspect of the question is more contingent, but not entirely different, perhaps. The pottery has all been recovered from ancient graves and cemeteries, and we may therefore reasonably suppose that the designs are essentially stereotyped and traditional,2 handed down from a remoter epoch, and that they are associated with magico-religious ideas. Very possibly then the designs are not always merely decorative, as indeed some of them suggest (Fig. 6, a, c, 1, n, q). The pottery and the Cave designs are very possibly of the same order of antiquity in millennia B.C.3 The signs painted on the White-Lined pots may. well have had a significance for their designers analogous to that which the similar signs had for the Cave artists, and it is very unlikely that these were merely graffiti. This is not to suggest that the original significance of the designs was, in the pictographic stage, necessarily known to the vase painters. Further, this kind of material may have suggested th-e plant-forms which figure so largely on the W-L pottery. Primitive man does not deliberately devise a scheme of decoration for his work, but is influenced by natural marks in the object used, or by religious, magical or other associations with it. Through conscious or unconscious variations these in process of time undergo change. In this way symbols may lose their meanings, 1 This paper is virtuallv an extension of Piette's researches into a wider field.. He sought to show connections with the Mediterranean Alphabet with which Petrie has collated a large number of Early Egyptian pot-marks. About half his signs occur in Fig. 5 under c. MIany of them are simple signs of T, 0, X, N, Z, H, etc., form. 2 The prototypes possibly of funerary reliefs of historical times. The scenes of hunting and trapping oi the White-Lined pottery (cp. Fig. 6c) and the boats on the Decorated ware may well have been transferred to the tomb walls and developed into the well-known " Happy Hunting G-round " scenes of the XVIIIth-dynasty tombs. (See e.g. Fig. 6, a, c.) 3 In any case, many of the signs certainly persisted through the Neolithic into the Copper Age (Obermaier).</page><page sequence="9">Ancient Egypt, Libya, and the South Spanish Caves. 393 or the meanings survive attached to an unintelligible design, or the thing be perpetuated as a design devoid of all other significance.1 Some of the W-L motifs are not like plants (e.g. Fig. 5, 12dl and 2, 14d, 32dl and 2), and on some of the pottery the elements of the design do not suggest that they have been used solely to decorate the surface.2 Some of the designs are clearly plants (Fig. 6, a, g), and the plant-like figures above discussed are only called in question because of their resemblance to the given examples from the Spanish Caves, taken with such striking cases as Fig. 5, Nos. 3, 4, 31, 33.3 Fig. 7 shows in four parallel columns some composite signs which may have similar meanings, e.g. family groups or other relationships or connections like that attributed by Breuil to the Spanish Cave examples. Examples in column c are curiously like the Nsibidi examples (to be considered presently), and examples in column a have affinities with both e and the Nsibidi signs.4 Nsibidi is a quasi-secret pictographic writing, many of the signs being only known to properly initiated persons of the Nsibidi Society, confined, as far as is known, to the Ekoi and Efik tribes of Southern Nigeria. The former claim to have invented it, and derive the name from a word meaning to " turn," in the sense of mental agility, cunning, double-meaning. The latter attribute its invention to a species of baboon, and derive its name from a word meaning to " play " or perform some- thing. The natives are very reticent to Europeans about it. The characters have long been known as designs for female facial tatu and calabash decoration; its significance as writing was only discovered some twenty years ago. The language is capable of remarkable nicety of expression and graphicness of description, although there are no rules as to order, position, or direction of reading. It has vitality enough to produce new signs to suit modern requirements (e.g. 23). Its age is unknown, but it is old enough to be mentioned in folk-tales.5 1 Henry Balfour, Evolution of Decorative Art. 2 The cross-hatched vandyke patterns, waved parallel lines, and " gratings " are regarded by Petrie (Prehistoric Pottery) as suggested by basket-work prototypes, but examples like Fig. 6, d, h, 1, n, do not suggest this. Fig. 6, 1, mn, suggests, at any rate, that the grating is a motif as well as basketry, although, as mentioned above, the former is possibly basket-work for corraling game. The hatched examples with regular patterns seem, as on this hypothesis might be expected, to be the latest, as the general designs seem to survive in modern Kabyle and Shawia pottery (vide, MacIver, Eastern Libyans). 3 The remarks quoted above regarding primitive design are possibly applicable to what are regarded as the prototypes of hieroglyphics on Early Dynastic pottery. For example, the khent sign (Fig. 5, 5c) may have survived as the symbol of the meaning " before," "in front of," when the significance of the actual drawing was forgotten, and been reinterpreted as three pots. Similarly, 14c, sa, "protection," re-interpreted as knotted cords, or foot-stalls for donkeys. Three men in the first example, and a figure (? fetish) in the second, conform equially well with the meanings of the pictograplhs. 4 Example b is possibly of phallic significance (Burkitt, Prehistory, pl. 46). 5 For Nsibidi, vide Man, 1910, 67; Journ. Roy. Anth. Inst., xxxix, p. 209; and P. A. Talbot, In the Shadow of the Bush.</page><page sequence="10">394 E. S. THOMAS.-A Comparison of Drawings from Ancient Egypt, etc. Among the signs given, 6, 28, and 29 may be noted, the calabash series being particularly interesting (op. Fig. 5, 33). Rock drawings with considerable resemblances to several of the Spanish Cave types have been noted on the Welle (Azande country), in Portuguese East Africa, and on the Upper Niger, French Sudan, which is as far afield as the Nsibidi region. ..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 14 .. l, a. b c Z NeibLdL. 79. 1 L X .G,4 C i , ,D,, P aRee 2 X 1 mfk% 4*'teyC(ra) S .TGwvl~hCe~I~ 6.

Its origin may possibly reinforce the weak threads of connection here indicated between it, and the designs discussed above. The character of the script strengthens the suggestion that the rock signs of Ancient Spain and Libya,' composed, as they appear to be, so largely of anthropo- and theriomorphic designs, and accessories of the chase, will prove to be pictographs conveying information and not mere scribbles or decoration, and that there is more in some of the pottery designs of Early Egypt than at present meets the eye. I The Ekoi, the chief exponents of Nsibidi, are of that so-called Caucasian (? Hamitic) stock which is to-day being increasingly recognized as Libyan in origin.</page></plain_text>
