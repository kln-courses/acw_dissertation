As Alejo Carpentier has pointed out (and as architectural critics confirm), the Caribbean lacks a monumental architectural baroque heritage comparable with that of the mainland, such as the hyperornate Churrigueresque ultrabaroque of central Mexico and Peru (fig. I).1 Nevertheless, it was two Cuban intellectuals, Alejo Carpentier and Jose Lezama Lima, who spearheaded a new turn in neobaroque dis course after World War II by popularizing the notion of an insurgent, mestizo New World baroque unique to the Americas. Carpentier and Lezama Lima are the key authors of the notion of a decoloniz ing American baroque, a baroque that expressed contraconquista (counterconquest), as Lezama punned, countering the familiar iden tification of the baroque with the repressive ideology of the Counter Reformation and its allies, the imperial Catholic Iberian states (80). Lezama and Carpentier argue that the imported Iberian state baroque was transformed into the transculturated, syncretic New World ba roque at the hands of the (often anonymous) native artisans who con tinued to work under the Europeans, grafting their own indigenous traditions onto the iconography of the Catholic baroque style. The New World baroque is a product of the confluence (however unequal) of Iberian, pre-Columbian, and African cultures during the peaceful seventeenth century and into the eighteenth in Spain's and Portugal's territories in the New World. The examples studied by Lezama and Carpentier are all from the monumental baroque sculpture and ar chitecture of Mexico, the Andes, and Brazil's Minas Gerais province: the work of the Brazilian mulatto artist O Aleijadinho (Antonio Fran cisco Lisboa [1738-1814]; see fig. 2 in Zamora in this issue) and the indigenous Andean artist Jose Kondori (dates unknown; see fig. 1 in Zamora), central Mexico's Church of San Francisco Xavier Tepotzo tl?n (fig. 1), and the folk baroque Church of Santa Maria Tonantzintla (see fig. 3 in Zamora), to mention a few landmarks and names. MONIKA KAUP is associate professor of English and adjunct associate pro fessor of comparative literature at the University of Washington. She is the coeditor (with Lois Parkinson Zamora) of Baroque New Worlds: Representation, Transculturation, Counterconquest (Duke UP, forthcoming).

Why does it take two Cuban intellectuals to theorize and pro mote the insurgent American baroque? And what role does the local Cuban baroque play in the theorization of the New World baroque? What exactly is the Cuban baroque, if it is somehow intangible and deficient in compari son with the splendid monumental baroque on the mainland? Carpentier repeatedly takes up the question of the Cuban baroque. In his 1964 essay about Havana, "The City of Col umns," he suggests that the Cuban baroque is a nameless "third style" resulting from the spontaneous adaptation and mixing of official architectural styles. He writes, "The superim position of styles, the innovation of styles good _E ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I l l ~~~~~~~I 3 ft 0 t 5* &lt;/? &amp;&gt; 3 a 3 ft f+ T 0 a o 0 w ft Fig, i Main altarpiece, Church of San Francisco Xavier Tepotzotl?n, eighteenth century.

C and bad... created for Havana a style without style that in the long run, through a process of symbiosis and amalgamation, became a pecu liar kind of Baroque that functioned as style and inscribed itself in the history of urban behavior" (emphasis mine). In this essay and throughout Carpentier's work, the Cuban ba roque coincides with the New World baroque in that both are impure, hybrid forms result ing from the sociohistory of mestizaje that Cuba shares with Latin America: "Cuba did not achieve compelling Baroque carvings, im ages, or buildings. But fortunately, Cuba was mixed blood, as was Mexico or Upper Peru, and as with all hybridism, through a process of symbiosis, it engendered a Baroque spirit." To mark their divergence from the Euro pean state baroque, the Cuban baroque and the New World baroque may best be pictured as originating from a dynamic process rather than as a finished (built) product, as a doing or making rather than a being. Put differently, the Cuban and the New World baroques begin where the official European baroque ends, in the long afterlife following initial design and early years of construction when unplanned, local practices of use and adaptation begin to grind down the pure outlines of the planned, official city. In Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guat taris terms, the American baroques are what colonized, minor subjects construct, from the bottom up, within the major European cul tural and artistic forms that are imposed on them and that they are powerless to reject. At stake in the difference between major and mi nor baroques is nothing less than the question of liberation in cultural production, in partic ular the possibility of rebellious consumption against the grain of origins?re-creation by re cycling?that is to say, the creative remaking of existing, institutionalized expression for anti institutional and subversive purposes.2 Angel Rama points out the overlap between the ba roque and the implementation of colonial state and church authority in Latin America: "One could say that the American continent became the experimental field for the formulation of a new Baroque culture. The first methodical ap plication of Baroque ideas was carried out by absolute monarchies in their New World em pires, applying rigid principles?abstraction, rationalization, and systematization?and opposing all local expressions ..." (10). Could colonial subjects appropriate and resignify an institutionalized expression like the Iberian state baroques to combat the same institutions that imposed it as an instrument of empire in Spain's and Portugals overseas colonies? While the monumental baroque architec ture of central Mexico and the Andes displays the impressive end products of sociohistori cal processes of becoming minor, I want to suggest here that Carpentier's depiction of Havana's Cuban baroque offers something like a dramatic, live rendering of the process in action. This popular process of anarchic recycling involves the proliferating columns that figure centrally in Carpentier's "City of Columns." At the beginning of the nineteenth century, writes Carpentier, classical columns abandon their original site in interior patios to "propel [themselves] into the streets," where they multiply and transform, resulting in "the incredible profusion of columns in a city that is an emporium of columns, a jungle of col umns, an infinite colonnade ... hybrid ad in finitum!' Carpentier, who was the son of an architect and had to abandon his studies to ward an architecture degree at the University of Havana at his parents' divorce, explicitly contrasts Havana's irregular urban pattern to academic "urbanism" and "urban planning." According to Carpentier, Havana's baroque arises from outside the planned, official con ceptual city?it is the product of "an irreverent and offbeat replay of classical forms," playfully "accumulating, collecting, and multiplying columns and colonnades in ... an excess of Doric and Corinthian, of Ionic and compos ite capitals." To make his point, Carpentier re mains silent about the monumental baroque actually found in the Caribbean, of which</page><page sequence="4">12 4-1 ] Monika Kaup 159 Cuba's capital possesses a major landmark, the Cathedral of Havana (1748-77), a former Jesuit church influenced by Francesco Borro mini, one of the famous architects of the Ro man baroque (fig. 2).3 In claiming that "Cuba is not Baroque like Mexico, Quito, or Lima," Carpentier is technically correct, as he affirms the absence of the hyperornate, late baroque Churrigueresque in the Caribbean (fig. 1). But he turns a blind eye to existing monuments of the Cuban baroque?albeit fewer in number and more restrained and sober than those of the mainland's Churrigueresque?to single out as the Cuban baroque the spontaneous, unplanned eclecticism and deformation of academic forms that produced them. In a 1974 interview, Carpentier offers what is likely his most striking statement on the antimonumental Cuban baroque: I would say that the Cuban Baroque . . . cor responds to an ecology. Our colonial period has not left us many examples of Baroque architecture comparable to those of Mexico, Peru, or Ecuador. And yet, Cuba is Baroque in its grille work, its glasswork, its furniture, the traditional vegetation of its patios. And in things intangible and yet present, quotidian, familiar: the use of language, the omnipres ence of music and the sea, the color of things, a certain luxuriant atmosphere, a certain dance rhythm that arises when least expected. I don't know. The Cuban Baroque is difficult to define: it is in the air one breathes. One feels it. (qtd. in Zamora, Inordinate Eye 158) Here Carpentier most clearly identifies the Cuban baroque with the realm of the ev eryday, of the multiple activities of everyday practice?such as storytelling, walking, eat ing, cooking, reading, playing music, dancing, even breathing?which are also the subject of Michel de Certeau's The Practice of Everyday Life. According to Certeau, practice?that is, how users make do with the structures they inhabit but do not design or build or con trol?is the realm of antidiscipline. Despite capitalisms best efforts to reduce use to pas sive consumption, he argues, everyday prac tice is stubborn, devious, and creative. It finds ways of appropriating and resignifying offi cial structures and systems that impose order on and dominate practice and that practice has no choice but to inhabit. The history of discipline recounted by Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu is only half the story: Certeau insists that no matter how efficiently official systems control, colonize, and represent the everyday, this in itself tells us nothing about what the everyday is to the user. We must therefore study concrete local and historical ways of unplanned, vernacular use?how real people actually make do and live with and in the ready-made official world. The idea I want to explore here is that Car pentier's mysterious, elusive Cuban baroque is nothing other than Certeau's insurgent every day practice, which exists in all periods and places. Incidentally, this is also how we should read Carpentier's dubious (from an art his torical point of view) concept of the baroque as a transhistorical type?a human spirit that recurs throughout history?inspired by the Catalan art critic Eugenio d'Ors. When Car pentier calls the baroque a "human constant" and a "creative spirit" manifest in all cultures and denies that the baroque is "an invention of the 17th century," he is thinking of the ever-present realm of practice ("The Baroque" 90-91). In the Cuban baroque, the creativity of anti-institutional, popular use and recy cling stands out so clearly precisely because of the antimonumental nature of the simple materials it works on?not so much grand objects like cathedrals as everyday objects like tropical fruit, food, dance, and, to men tion Carpentier's other examples in "The City of Columns," fanlights, glass-door screens, and wrought-iron gates. Since the Cuban ba roque is defined as spontaneous, secondhand production (remaking by recycling) rather than product (being), it expands the range of baroque materials: nearly anything (fruit, sr ft o a 3 ft #?*&gt; y o a o o 2. ft*</page><page sequence="5">i6o Cuban Baroque and Visual Culture in Alejo Carpentier, Ricardo Porro, and Ramon Alejandro [ PMLA w&gt; 0 0 "? 0 X H a; E "u s OJ "Z o 0; X *-?

Yet how exactly can tropical fruit, such as the papaya, become baroque? With this ques tion, I turn to the contemporary visual art works of the architect Ricardo Porro and the painter Ramon Alejandro, both Cubans. They have in common the fusion of European art and vernacular Afro-Cuban culture, as well as a focus on the papaya, which appears at the center of their?albeit very different?neoba roque works. I will discuss Porro s School of Plastic Arts, one of Cuba's five national art schools constructed between 1961 and 1965 in Cubanac?n, a Havana suburb (figs. 3-6). An architectural experiment of the early years of the Cuban Revolution constructed on the grounds of the most exclusive country club of prerevolutionary Havana, the curvilinear complexes of brick and terra-cotta domed huts and porticoed walkways feature vernacular Afro-Cuban influences and explicit sensual symbolism. Sadly, the national art schools fell from grace in the year of their completion be cause of an ideological polemic.4 This was in part because of the overt sensuality of Porro 's School of Plastic Arts: in its central plaza, it features a fountain in the shape of a papaya, a symbol for the female sex in Cuba. On the in side of the fountain can be found drains in the form of little phalluses (fig. 5). "It is amusing to note," John Loomis reports in his history of the art schools, "that water was banned for a period from Porro s suggestive fountain, on Party orders" (123). As the Utopian phase of the Cuban Revolution ended and Cuba entered the Soviet orbit, the art schools' vernacular, ethnosensual heresies succumbed to the dic tates of Soviet-style modernist functionalism. In effect, Porro's neobaroque design, sensitive to local, ethnic, and historical dimensions that modernist functionalism sets out to erase, fell victim to the rationalism of Soviet industrial ized modernism. Abandoned and reduced to ruins, the national art schools began to be re claimed by the Cuban regime in the 1990s and will soon be restored (Segre 144).

(Go Papaya!), which celebrates Ramon Alejandro's paintings, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, a fellow Cuban, explains how the papaya becomes baroque: "In Cuba . . . the papaya is called fruta bomba. ... To coun ter assertions by ignorant foreign critics, the term bomba does not refer to a bomb; rather, it carries major sexual connotations. Bomba is the Cubanization of one of the terms for the female sex in Yoruba, embomba"5 This baroque mechanism of allegorical indirec tion and circumlocution is identical with the process of metonymic displacement along the chain of signifiers: the term for the tropical fruit?papaya?is substituted by fruta bomba, which in turn yields to the Afro-Cubanism embomba and finally to the latters sexual ref erent. Indeed, in his 1972 essay "The Baroque and the Neobaroque," Severo Sarduy, a Cu ban writer, names Porro s papaya fountain as an example for his poststructuralist theory of the baroque as antirealist "artificialization." According to Sarduy, [I]n the architecture of Ricardo Porro ... the functional elements of the architectonic struc ture are sometimes replaced by others that serve as signifiers only when inserted into that context as mechanical supports: a drainpipe is converted ... into a flute, a femur, or phal lus; a fountain assumes the form of a papaya, a Cuban fruit. This last substitution is particu larly interesting, because ... by expelling the "normal" signifier of the function and putting another, completely alien one in its place, what occurs is the eroticization of the totality of the work... by means of linguistic cunning. Associating the baroque and the neobaroque with "the apotheosis of artifice" and "the irony and mockery of nature," Sarduy high lights the creative disfigurement at the core of minor baroque expression. Sarduy s notion of the baroque is akin to parody, to the defor mation of a previous work, to the re-creative work of everyday practice as theorized by Cer teau, and to the elusive operations of Carpen tiers antimonumental Cuban baroque. More generally, the light Sarduy sheds on baroque ~~~~~~xg ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~ ;?0A'EVV~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I W6S,vWi FIG. 4 View of entrance, School of Plastic Arts.

The Cuban baroque thus showcases the insurgent creativity of everyday practice, which does not produce originals but remakes existing materials. This secondhand mode of production as rearticulation also describes the condition of cultural production in colonial and postcolonial locations such as Latin Amer ica. According to the Mexican critic Gonzalo Celorio, "In light of our Spanish, colonial, and therefore eccentric past, our American origi nality is to adopt ideas that are, in principle, alien to us but that we have made our own by virtue of the fact that we neither had them nor can have them. Herein lies our originality." Porro thinks of his architecture as neo baroque and as black architecture, as express ing a Cuban baroque that is distinct from the European and infused with Afro-Cuban symbolism. For his preoccupation with Bor romini, one of Porro's nicknames in Cuban architecture circles was "Porromini." "Unde niably," Porro reminisces, "Porromini fits me quite well, because his influence on my archi tecture was very strong.... There is a power ful baroque aspect to everything I do."6 He is familiar with the writings of Lezama and Sarduy on this subject: In the moment that I conceived the School of Plastic Arts I was interested very much in 7 ft 0 n ft 1A fi&gt; 3 a 3 ft r+ ST 0 a o o ?2, 5* (* Fig. 5 Fountain La Papaya, School of Plastic Arts.

Cuba is not Catho lic. Cuba is a country where the African re ligion has more force than the Catholic. So I tried to make an arquitectura negra, a city seized by a negritud that had never before had a presence in architecture.

In Cuba this new Baroque is fully expressed. It is also that which I wished to express in my School of Plastic Arts. (qtd. in Loomis 57-68)7 In addition to the papaya fountain, sensual sym bolism appears in the domed roofs, which recall African huts as well as the female breast (fig. 6). A description of the entryway of the complex gives a sense of the disorienting baroque space of Porro's School of Plastic Arts (figs. 3 and 4): In the School of Plastic Arts, Porro organizes three powerful trumpet-shaped arches to form an entry; by tradition, by experience, by archi tectural convention?the three porticoes of Christian churches?we expect that the central arch would be that which dominates the devel opment of the composition.

I would say that this is an "atheist" composition that denies to us the "path to the altar." The spectator is disarmed by the entrance, dazed, and his system of ori entation collapses in a sensorial abyss. (Hugo Consuegra, qtd. in Loomis 167) While in Paris in the early 1950s, Porro be friended the Cuban painter Wifredo Lam, whom he "credits for having had a great in fluence on him" (Loomis 10; see also Porro, "Cuidadano" 13). Lam famously translated his mixed heritage (he was the son of a Chi nese father and an Afro-Cuban mother) into the tropical modernism embodied by his celebrated 1943 painting La Jungla (The Jungle). Indeed, Lam inaugurates the remak ing of European avant-garde style in painting through vernacular Afro-Cuban content and symbolism; also in Lams work papayas (with their sensual associations) first appear in Cu ban painting as visual puns?see the bulbous fruta bomba as parts of female anatomy in La Jungla (Fletcher; Sims; Cabrera Infante). My third example of the Cuban baroque, Ramon Alejandro, is a painter who, like Sar duy, left Havana permanently for Paris in the 1960s. His allegorical canvases stage tropical fruit and vegetation?frequently the papaya? at the center of surreal still lifes and fantastic anthropomorphic assemblages he calls "ma chines" (figs. 8 and 9; Alejandro 10). Critics have pointed out that these are reminiscent of Giovanni Piranesi and the mannerist painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo's anthropomorphic vi sual puns composed of fruit and vegetables (Ponte 9; Rojas). Alejandro's work also con tinues Lams tropical surrealism, as well as the Cuban tradition of creative recycling that Carpentier calls the Cuban baroque. As Ca brera Infante notes, the striking sexuality of Alejandro's work results from the fact that he opens the papaya that Lam always kept closed. Many of Alejandro's human-fruit or human-plant hybrids are found as illustrations in Orlando Gonzalez Esteva's entertaining study Cuerpos en bandeja: Frutas y erotismo en Cuba (Bodies on a Platter: Fruit and Erot icism in Cuba). Discussing the erotic symbol ism around tropical fruit in Cuban literature and culture since the eighteenth century, Gonzalez Esteva notes that it is no wonder that Cubans end up developing the complexes and properties of fruit, just as fruit have come to develop the properties and complexes of human beings_In the midst of a luxurious vegetation and alleged artifacts of torture, fruit of various and at times mysterious kinds, dogs, goats, birds' feathers, reclining and in terlacing trunks that improvise rare architec tures (like skeletons of some Cuban Tower of Babel), masks, shells, turbulent skies, and nude women and men armed with machetes, Cuban nature opens its legs and shows the pa paya, equally open, gigantic, appetizing-8 There is a gleam around Alejandro's sliced open papayas that elicits desire and lures the spectator (figs. 8 and 10). As in Freud's fetish ism, it results from the displacement of sig nification from the everyday object depicted (the papaya and other tropical fruit like ba nanas, avocados, guan?banas [soursops], and mangoes) to the sexual organ that is indi rectly referenced through the fetish as sym bolic substitute (fig. 7). Yet, as is to be expected in the baroque, fa mous for ironic reversals and visual games like trompe l'oeils, Alejandro's neobaroque assem blages refuse simple voyeuristic gratification. Instead, each image stages an interminable oscillation between opposite poles, fashion ing an enigma related to (although not strictly identical with) the mise en abyme, a popular baroque framing structure (picture within the picture, play within the play) that incorporates its own picture into the body of its representa tion (Braider 8).

What appears to be natural and real in the lower part of the canvas is unmasked as artificial in the upper part, as if to say, Gotcha! This amounts to?in Rafael Rojas's apt observation?placing the words "come hither" and "no entry" "on the frontis piece of the same temple."9 As the spectators eye scans the image, it is caught in an infinite play of illusion and disillusionment (engano I desengano), which holds the contradiction in endless tension without resolution. This prin ciple is also at work in La controversia (The Controversy; fig. 9) and Boda mistica del Rey Balthasar (KingBalthasars Mystical Wedding; fig. 10). Objects of torment and pain are found next to, or mutate into, objects of pleasure; pleasure and pain are ambivalent features of the same represented scene. Paranoid spaces of fear and incarceration morph into erotic spaces of sexual and culinary pleasure, and vice versa. In La controversia, the anthropo morphic machines double row of nails threat ens even as the guandbana just behind them attracts: the vagina dentata. In Boda mistica del Rey Balthasar, the knife with which King Balthasar has sliced open the papaya is sus pended next to his genitals, auguring violence and pleasure in equal amounts for his epony mous mystical wedding. Alejandro stages fetishism's illusionist make-believe to reflect on its process: oper ating along the lines of Sarduy's theory of baroque antirealism, Alejandro's paintings play neobaroque games of deception and dis illusionment around the similarities Cuban culture constructs between human forms and tropical fruit. Everything that seems palpable and ready to be savored evaporates as yet another simulation, only to be reincarnated with its original spell intact?and so on to in finity. In his tropical still lifes, Alejandro ren ders organic nature surreal and artificial to make explicit its overdetermination through the ethnolinguistic web of vernacular Cuban Fig. 7 Ram?n Alejandro, La champola: La douceur du corossol (La Champola: The Sweetness ofSoursop [the title refers to a soursop juice drink]), 1989.

More than Porro in his papaya fountain, Alejandro thus exposes the sheer conventionality of Cuban sensual sym bolism by depicting neobaroque allegorical assemblages (fig. 9). Carpentier posed the question of the Cu ban baroque through the paradigm of the anti-institutional minor baroque that remakes official, institutional culture. His claim that Havana was not baroque like Latin Ameri can capitals on the mainland shifted attention away from monumental architecture to the baroque in simple, ordinary objects. Porro fol lows Carpentier s directive by staging the in surgent creativity of Cuban everyday practice: he incorporates vernacular Afro-Cubanisms (the sexual connotations of the papaya). How ever, his work is still in the monumental me dium of architecture, where baroque features appear as ornaments (papaya fountain) and as structural devices of disorientation (the triple-arched entrance) that set built space in motion. Finally, Alejandro completes the tra jectory outlined by Carpentier: his work is an extended investigation (and celebration) of the antimonumental, antiofficial baroque emerg ing from Cuban popular culture. His ultraba roque papayas and tropical fruit are the minor counterpart of the heavy ornamentation of the major Churrigueresque. But Alejandro's papayas are hyperbaroque in an additional, self-reflective way that the Churrigueresque is not: the painter's actual subject is a semiotic analysis of the extravagant signifying mecha nism by which Cuban culture metaphorizes human bodies as tropical fruit and vice versa. Notes 1. The Churrigueresque is an eighteenth-century late baroque style named after the Spanish Churriguera family of artists; the eldest of the five brothers in the family, all architects and decorators, was Jose Benito de Ramon Alejandro, |^y^3^Hj^^^^^^^^^^HeifTHHR^ c^^HBI^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H /.a (T"/?e ShS^ on m?i^^^^^^^^^Kt^MlM r\jj0gB|[ the painter.

"Though the Churrigueresque is often considered synonymous with Spanish Baroque," Pamela Gosner writes, "there are differences, and it might more properly be regarded as an offshoot of it. Although the interruption of straight lines is characteristic of both, as are twisted columns, broken pediments and entabla tures, and heavy decoration, in the Churrigueresque the decoration is so heavy and the breaking up of the lines so pronounced that the architectural forms themselves dis appear. This extreme, while common in Mexican and Pe ruvian colonial architecture, is not seen in the Antilles." Another characteristic feature of the Churrigueresque (which appears in the church at Tepotzotl?n, in fig. 1) is "estipites, pilasters shaped like inverted obelisks and of ten broken into segments" (26). 2. For an exploration of the notion of a minor ba roque, see Kaup. 3. Gosner explains that the "most obvious manifesta tion of the Baroque [in Cuba] was visible in details such as doorframes, arch and gable profiles, and other decora tions. Not until the end of the 18th century do fully real ized Baroque buildings appear in the Antilles" (239). This gradual arrival of the baroque in Cuba, and its first en trance through miniature forms such as ornamental detail, is likely behind Carpentier's antimonumental approach to the Cuban baroque. Ives Bottineau concurs: "Cuban decoration was relatively sober_Baroque here has been termed Borrominesque rather than Churrigueresque, not so much on account of the plans but because facades, such as that of Havana cathedral... are reminiscent of the ar chitecture of S. Carlo alle Quattro Fontane" (91-92). 4. Throughout this essay, I am indebted to John Loomis's excellent documentation of the complex history of the Cuban art schools. See also Homenaje. 5. All unattributed translations are mine. "En Cuba ... la papaya se llama fruta bomba. Este nombre apar entemente explosivo le sirvio a un escritor frances, igno rante, para declarar que en Cuba fidelista hasta las frutas podian defender a la isla de una agresi?n extranjera. Lo cierto es que esta bomba en la fruta no estalla pero es de una connotaci?n sexual mayor que la primitiva papaya. Bomba es la cubanizaci?n de uno de los nombres del sexo feminino en yoruba, embomba" (I have taken the liberty of translating loosely for reasons of space). 6. "Innegablemente, Porromini me viene muy bien, porque su influencia en mi arquitectura fue muy grande. ... Hay un lado barroco muy fuerte en todo lo que hago" (Porro, "Cuidadano" 14). 7. It is worthwhile to read in full Porro's brief 1982 es say "Cuba y yo," from which these translations are taken. 8. "Que los cubanos acaben por desarollar complejos y propiedades de fruta, tal y como las frutas hand venido desarollando propiedades y complejos humanos, no debe producir extraneza. ... En medio de una vegetaci?n lu juriosa, y entre presuntos artefactos de tortura, frutas de diversa y a veces misteriosa indole, perros, chivos, plumas de ave, troncos que al recostarse y trabarse improvisan in usitadas arquitecturas (como esqueletos de unas cubanas torres de Babel), mascaras, caracoles, cielos tormentosos y mujeres y hombres desnudos armados con machetes, la naturaleza cubana abre las piernas y muestra la papaya, igualmente abierta, gigante, golosa..." (85, 38). 9. "El Ven' y el 'no entraras' como inscripciones en el frontispicio del mismo templo." Works Cited Alejandro, Ramon.
