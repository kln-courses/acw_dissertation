Wood, pigment; 31.8cm (12.5"). Museum purchase with funds from an anonymous donor in memory of Bryce Holcombe, 92.816. Belonging to the Mukui society, face masks like this one are thought to represent the spirits of deceased women who have come back from the land of the dead. Scholars report witnessing dancers on stilts wearing these masks. Each dancer, using a hidden device made of small gourds and spider webs to disguise his voice, speaks for the dead one's spirit. Right: Magical figure (nkisi). Kongo, Zaire. Late 19th century. Wood, mirror; 24.8cm (9.75"). Gift of Philip Thelin, New Orleans, in memory of his grandparents, Chief Justice of Switzerland and Madame Henri Thelin-Panchaud de Bottens, 94.213. This nkisi figure is one of two sculptures collect- ed by Victor Panchaud de Bottens of Vich, Swit- zerland, who was banished to Africa in 1895 by his mother as punishment for divorcing his patri- cian wife. Since it shows no evidence that any substances were ever added to it, Panchaud probably acquired the carving in a Kongo market as a souvenir of his travels. One outstanding fea- ture is the small figure with crossed arms and inlaid mirror eyes, incorporated into the coiffure cascading down the figure's back. Left: Divination tray (opon Ifa), by Areogun of Osi- Ilorin (ca. 1880-1956). Yoruba, Ekiti region, Nige- ria. Early 20th century. Wood, 46.4cm (18.25"). Partial and promised gift of H. Russell Albright, M.D., New Orleans, 90.389. A wood tray, usually round or oval, is the central instrument used by the diviner-priest in Ifa divina- tion ceremony. After he has marked a cross des- ignating the crossroads in the fine wood dust spread upon the opon Ifa, the priest taps on the tray to invoke the presence of the ancient Ifa priests. The large face on the rim represents Eshu, the Yoruba god of chance and uncertainty, known as the messenger or trickster. The various low-relief figures and intertwined patterning have a complex iconography related to Ifa ritual. PHOTOS: OWEN MURPHY.

Glass beads, cloth; 88.9cm x 122cm (35" x 48"). Museum purchase, Robert P. Gordy and Carrie Heiderick Funds, 91.29. The motifs and quality of the work speak of the importance of the wearer of this royal garment. The three-dimensional bird figures represent the king's abilities in the spiritual realm, whether in combating witches or seeking religious guid- ance. The complex knotted patterns attest to his powers to solve the difficult problems con- fronting his office. : ---: y:; I??~"-~~M::T ~~~i ~mi:~ :??'--?-?--~ u~c-~-~~ i C PHOTO: OWEN MURPHY, COURTESY OF THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART Left: Leopard-head hip ornament (uhunmwu- nekhue). Benin kingdom, Nigeria. 18th/19th cen- tury. Brass alloy, 18.4cm (7.25"). Gift of Frangoise Billion Richardson in memory of her sister Armande Billion, 90.32. At formal palace events, chiefs of various rank wear these mask-like ornaments over wrapped skirts gathered at the left hip as one element of their full ceremonial regalia. This hip ornament joins another, in the form of a mask, in the muse- um's collection. Opposite page: Royal twin figure with cloak and cap (ere ibeji). Yoruba, Nigeria. Wood, glass beads, polychrome, leather, fabric; 35.6cm (14"). Gift of Mrs. P.R. Norman, New Orleans, 91.480. The Yoruba have one of the highest incidences of twin birthing in the world. Unfortunately, there is also a commensurately high mortality rate for twins. Since the Yoruba believe that twins share the same soul, this carving was commissioned by the mother to replace a dead twin. The sculp- ture was cared for-fed, bathed, and clothed- by the mother as if it were the child itself. Its elab- orate beaded garments indicate the degree of maternal affection, and possible royal parentage.

Ca. 500 B.C.-A.D. 200. Terracotta, 21.6cm (8.5"). Museum purchase with funds from an anonymous donor, 94.148. This sculpture is believed to be the first Nok piece in the permanent collection of an Amer- ican museum. It joins terracottas from the Djenne and Bankoni cultures and the Benin, Akan, and Kuba kingdoms in the museum's holdings. The salient features of this head include asymmetri- cal eyes, fragmentary indications of a mustache and chin beard, and a hairdo comprising three clear-cut raised rectangular areas with carefully incised designs. Seated male figure (nomoli). Sapi, Sierra Leone/Li- beria. Stone, 31cm (12.25"). Gift of Helen and Dr. Robert Kuhn, Los Angeles, 91.652. Found buried in the ground, stone figures like this example strongly relate stylistically to the Afro- Portuguese ivories of the same area, dating from the 15th-16th centuries. The function they served these ancient peoples is not known. However, sculptures found by the present-day inhabitants have been adopted for their ancestral rituals. Female twin figures (ere ibeji), by Olowe of Ise. Yoruba, Ekiti region, Nigeria. Early 20th century. Wood, brass tacks, glass beads; 33.7cm, 32.4cm (13.25", 12.75"). Gift of Frangoise Billion Richard- son in honor of the opening of the Sadie Downman Billion and Olivier Armand Billion Gallery for African Art, 93.156.1 &amp; 2. About thirty carvings by the great master Olowe of Ise are known, and of these only one other is a twin figure. Since he worked exclusively on royal commissions, these carvings most likely represent members of the king's family. The sup- plicant, breast-holding gesture is unusual and suggests that the figures may have had a func- tion besides that of ibejis. 9 c o o "n PHOTO: OWEN MURPHY.

Luba, Zaire. Calabash, wood, caning, pitch; 33.7cm (13.25"). Gift of William Brill, New York, 95.20. The configuration of this anthropomorphic pipe echoes the familiar Luba half-female torsos sur- mounted on calabashes used for divination, which, according to Biebuyck, are associated with the Buhabo association. The smaller figure's gesture of touching her breasts repeats the pose of the central figure, which constitutes the stem of the pipe. Part of the small bowl of the pipe atop the little figure is missing. The figures are joined to the calabash and the tubular mouth- piece by interlaced caning covered with pitch. PHOTO: OWEN MURPHY. COURTESY OF THE NEW ORLEANS MUSEUM OF ART Mask. Sukuma, Tanzania. Late 19th/early 20th cen- tury. Wood, hair, pitch, leather; 31.8cm (12.5"). Mu- seum purchase with funds from an anonymous donor, 94.149. The Sukuma carve a variety of mask types. This mask, with its elemental skull-like shape, menac- ing eyes, and hair eyebrows and beard, has a ferocious expression exposing sharp teeth. (In some examples of this type, human teeth are implanted in the wood.) Animal hide ears, now missing, would have completed its frightening visage. Masks such as this are associated with agrarian rites. Interestingly, anyone who wanted to wear one of these masks could borrow it from the owner for a token fee. african arts o spring 1995 69</page></plain_text>
