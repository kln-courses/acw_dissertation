Man stands above all the other species because of the remarkable correlation of a forebrain and a prehensile hand, which combination of intellect and action produces an adaptation for man su- perior to that of any other species. The specific chapters are filled with illustrations from wide reading and personal experience. Wastefulness, which, of course, is determined by the human standards of the author, is most clearly seen in reference to time and energy, to materials, as seen in nest building, etc., to injury to other members of one's species and to self-injury. Not only does the dis- cussion run the gamut from the insects to the apes, but it includes the maladaptive activity among "low-cultured" and "high-cultured" human groups. In short, this book is something of a secondary rationalization of modern efficiency in terms of biological data. Efficiency is moral and cor- rect and rests on the rational faculties; inefficiency, or wastefulness, is immoral and rests on the unwitting instincts. The second of these books is far less pretentious and much more charmingly written. It is based on a wealth of personal observation un- fortunately spoiled by the author's penchant to drag in again and again comments of distinctly unwarranted anthropomorphic tone. It is to be regretted that writers on animal life seem either to run over into senti- mentalities, if not downright phantasies about animal mentality, or else to confine themselves to rather partial studies of animal behavior in the unnatural setting of laboratory maze or puzzle box. The merit of Kohl- er's work on the apes, aside from any theoretical matter on the side of Gestalt psychology, is his interesting observations on the daily life of the chimpanzees with which he worked. Miss Pitt's little volume, however, in spite of its subjective interpre- tations, is valuable not only in the discussion of learning, rage, migration, storing habits, nesting, and so on, but also in her revelation of the impor- tance of individual differences in animals. Over and over again one finds that members of the same species show differences in learning capacity, in ability to make their way in the world. This factor of individual dif- ferences assumes in Ritter's book large importance for his thesis of in- creasing adaptability. With Miss Pitt it is rather a part of her delightful picture of variety in animal behavior. KIMBALL YOUNG UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN</page></plain_text>
