<plain_text><page sequence="1">OF ANIMALS AND MEN: THE SYMBOLIC PARALLEL LYVIA MORGAN In Aegean iconography selected animals play out their designated roles in relation to human action. These are not studies of creatures in the wild, observed in the dispassionate manner of an ancient naturalist. The animals, for all the acute observation which went into their depictions, are there for a purpose: to aid, demonstrate and reflect aspects of human life. The role they play can be singular or multiple. But in multiplicity the roles complement one another, arising as they do from a particular characteristic of the animal in question. At times, in particular on the small surfaces of sealstones, animals appear to be isolated from human action. But the choice of animals is restricted to those which in other scenes have a relationship to man and which therefore refer to that action by implication. Signs next to the animal - the implement of sacrifice, the arrow of the hunt - refer the viewer to the implied action. This essay will look at certain forms of animal symbolism, the function of which is to draw a parallel between animal and human nature. The forms of symbolic parallelism under discussion are based on the idea of dominance. By nature of its subject, therefore, the essay is concerned with wild rather than domestic animals, who less obviously exercise dominance over one another and who already lie within the domain of man's control. Domination is a prevalent and multi-faceted theme. It may be manifested in scenes of animal against animal or man against animal. When the former, the iconography as a whole suggests that animal domination is depicted not for its own sake but as a parallel and role-model for the behaviour of man in his quest for control over his domain. Domination may be depicted through contest (bull-sports, ritual games), through conquest (bull-catching, the hunt) and through control (the captured and subdued beast). Through conquest, the stronger is defined. Bull-sports are a public manifestation of contest between humans and animals. In contrast, the man-lion duel is a private, and thereby heroic, contest between man and beast. The iconographie parallel between the behaviour of animals in the wild and the aggressive actions of men within society involves only certain species. The purpose of this essay is to explore what is involved in the choice of animal and how the idea of dominance is transformed into a symbolic model. KLADOS: ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF J. N. COLDSTREAM: BICS SUPPLEMENT 63 171</page><page sequence="2">172 KLADOS: ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF J. N. COLDSTREAM A. Man and Lion The parallelism of power between the lion1 and man the hunter- warrior is the most potent symbolic relationship between humans and other animals in Aegean - above all Mycenaean - art.2 The subject has been touched on in previous publications by the author and by Nanno Marinatos.3 Here, the instances and their implications are examined. The symbolic function of this parallel is the appropriation of the strength and power of the beast by man. Appropriation of power is the ultimate form of domination, encompassing a ritualized form of contest, with eventual conquest resulting in control over the forces of destruction. That control is achieved by absorbing the destructive forces into oneself, enabling them to be used efficaciously in combats to come. Such appropriation is inapplicable to the hunting of weaker or even equal animals. It is applied rather to animals whose superior strength and power need to be harnessed. The animal is respected. The hunt is a form of contest in this case, winner taking all, strengthened by the experience. To some extent all hunting is contest. Yet the hunting of deer, though a sport, has the functional purpose of providing food (whether for humans or deities). The animal is devoured but its strengths are not transferred to the victor of the chase. The wild boar is a special case. It was hunted not merely for sport and food but for the highly prized tusks used for the warriors' helmets. Rather as the North American Indian added feathers to his head- dress with increasing acts of bravery and rising of position in the social hierarchy,4 the boars' tusks glinted with the pride of the trophy. As a visible manifestation of bravery, the boar's tusk helmet was Acknowledgements. The seeds of this essay have been a decade in coming to fruition. I can think of no more appropriate place for it than in a volume honouring Nicolas Coldstream. I first became interested in the relationship between animal and man while working on my doctoral thesis under his expert supervision. We shared a fascination with creatures and their habits. First ideas on the lion appeared in my thesis (1980), published revised in 1988, with a preliminary article in AE (1983). The parallelism between the Theran Antelopes and Boxing Boys was first expressed in public lectures in Britain and America in the early 1980s and then at the 'L'iconographie minoenne' conference in Athens in 1983 (n. 34). In the publication of that conference paper I had the temerity to mention an intended article dealing with correspondences between animals and men, in which I planned to tackle the subjects of lion iconography and the Antelopes and Boys in particular. It was to be entitled 'Of Animals and Men'. Time passed, other things intervened. I am glad now to have the opportunity to develop these ideas into an essay which addresses the question of why such correspondences - or parallels - between animals and men were expressed in Aegean iconography. The essay is offered as a small token of my immeasurable thanks to Nicolas Coldstream. 1 Here the term lion is used to cover both the female lioness and the male lion. The iconography interchanges between the two. In reality it is the lioness that is the hunter, but it is doubtful that this fact was known to the peoples of the ancient world who would have seen the animal rarely. 2 The theme of lion attacking its prey is essentially a Mycenaean theme which originated in the Shaft Grave era. However, a few seals from Crete also depict the hunter-lion (see below, also I. Pini, 'Das Motiv des Löwenüberfalls in der spätminoischen und mykenischen Glyptik', in P. Darcque and J.-C.

MORGAN: OF ANIMALS AND MEN 173 worn by participants in the hunt as well as by warriors.5 The symbolism attached to the boar's tusk and by extension to the boar hunt has recently been fully examined by Christine Morris.6 In a sense, the boar hunt, like the lion hunt, is resonant of appropriation of power, as Morris herself suggests. What is taken from the boar, to be used as defensive armour, is the offensive weapon of the animal - the sharp pointed tusk. The helmet, says Morris, had an 'interlinked spectrum of referents (which) included both warfare and hunting, the protection of man and his territory, and Man's interaction with the natural world'.7 Such a description could also apply to the lion. Yet as Morris also comments, 4 how limited yet how sharply defined the image of the boar is' in comparison to the complex imagery of the lion.8 This partly reflects the lion's supremacy in the hierarchy of animal strength. Yet that is not the whole picture. The symbolism suggested by the acquisition of the tusks in the hunt, is a relatively local, that is Aegean, phenomenon. In contrast, the symbolism of the lion, complex as it was, had international application in the ancient world. Part of the reason for this must lie in the fact that the boar was an animal that was hunted locally (at least on the mainland). The lion, whether or not it roamed wild in southern Greece in the Bronze Age9 was a rare beast known more from tales of heroism, no doubt, than from familiarity. It is the mythical creatures of the world - the griffin, the dragon, and the myriad monsters of local mythologies - that acquire symbolic roles in the imaginations of mankind. It is no coincidence that in Aegean iconography the lion and griffin share the same symbolic roles.10 Indeed, the dual roles of destroyer and protector of the two creatures find widespread expression in the ancient world. As protector, they stand guard over gateways and entrances to palaces and temples, over thrones, altars, sacred pillars and warriors, in each case flanking the central figure or object which they protect. As destroyer, both lions and griffins are associated with warfare. Both are predators depicted attacking their prey and, as mutual antagonists, either may attack the other. A parallel may be drawn between the hero conquering the lion and the griffin attacking its animal prey. But whereas confrontation between man and lion is a recurrent theme, confrontation between man and griffin is not. It is this which separates the two beasts. For no matter how rare a creature the lion was, it was known in the flesh, its characteristics and hunting prowess were witnessed and it was a true force to be reckoned with by man. A real animal with legendary powers, the lion was a beast rarely, if ever, seen by the ordinary people. Tales of the hunt were told but confrontation was reserved for the hero. This is an ideal situation for symbolic appropriation. The most explicit example of man-animal parallelism is the lion-hunt dagger from Shaft Grave IV (fig. 1). On the two sides of the weapon the hunters attack their prey. In each case one prey is wounded while its mates flee down the narrowing blade of the dagger. Yet subtle differences express the certainty or uncertainty of the outcome based on the relative strength of the protagonists. On one side, a single lion attacks a deer, biting deep into his neck in certain death. The deer's hind legs still rise in flight but 5 Fragment of wall-painting from Orchomenos: Th.

On the other side, five men armed with spears and arrows and protected by huge shields lunge towards a single lion who has turned around to face the onslaught and, despite the spear aimed into his mouth and the wounding arrow on his flank, lunges in retaliation, paw raised in the fight. Far from having a sense of certain conquest, the boldness of the human hunters diminishes in direct relation to their proximity to the lion: the man closest has already fallen and the one behind pulls his shield around his body in protection.11 The two scenes are juxtaposed in the form of a parallelism of power. The lion defeats, the lion is defeated by man. Yet such is the strength of the lion that it is only by a superhuman or combined effort that man can overpower him. There is equality (hence the uncertainty of the outcome) and it is through that equality that the man-hunter is glorified. To kill a deer is commonplace for a hunter; to kill a lion is an extraordinary feat. In defeating the lion, its prowess is appropriated by the warrior. Such an idea appears to be expressed in the stele from above Grave V in Shaft Grave Circle B (fig. 2). In the lower register, the lion chases its animal prey. In the upper register a man holding a sword rides in a chariot. Beneath the legs of the horse lies a defeated warrior in figure-of-eight shield. The triumphant warrior and lion occupy the left side of the stone, moving to right; the defeated warrior and the lion's prey appear close together in the right-hand section. This symbolic relationship was widespread in Pharaonic Egypt. On an alabaster jar from Tutankh- amun's tomb a large lion sits on the lid, the pharoah's cartouche on his back (fig. 3). His red tongue extends from his mouth in exaggerated length. In Egyptian iconography the tongue was the symbol of will made manifest and of the personification of command. Red symbolized life and victory.12 Command and victory are the prerequisites of the warrior king. Depicted around the sides of the jar are scenes of lions attacking bulls and gazelle. On the columns separating these panels is the head of Bes, the protective spirit who averted evil and who was at times shown wearing a lion's skin. At the base of the jar, crushed as it were by the weight of the vessel, are four heads representing the defeated enemies of the pharoah from the four corners of the earth. The mythological and symbolic forms of the lion were many in Ancient Egypt.13 The lion as a symbol of strength was associated with the king from as early as the Archaic period, as was the symbolic depiction of the conquered lion in juxtaposition with the king's conquered enemy.14 While the warrior pharoah fought the lion, the lion was, in Ramesside times, also the companion of the king 11 To some extent these remarks may be countered by the idiomatic principles involved. The men are depicted in a line owing to the contingencies of space but in reality might be thought of as gathered around the lion. Similarly, the shield would not in reality be worn slung on the back but would in all cases have protected the front. That said, the artist is working within a set of conventions which are adaptable enough to be manipulated according to the needs of expression. The shield is shown frontally closest to the lion. 12 M. Lurker, The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Egypt (London 1980) 123 (tongue); 100 (red). 13 The male lion was a protector who, when placed on the roofs of temples, devoured and spat out the followers of Seth (the god of chaotic forces). The lioness was a destroyer who lent her skin to the Eye of Re in order to kill human rebels. Sekhmet, the Memphite goddess of war, was represented as a lioness or as a human with a lioness's head: G. Posener, A Dictionary of Egyptian Civilization (London 1962) 151; Lurker (op. cit. n. 12) 77. 14 See the Victory tablet of Narmer: on Side 1 the king smites a prisoner; on Side 2 the king processes towards his beheaded enemies; two captured leonine creatures with long entwined necks (J.B. Pritchard, The Ancient Near East in Pictures Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton 1969) pls. 296-7); Pritchard (283) calls them 'panthers', but they have no spots. Lange refers to 'fabulous animals' and suggests that they express the union of Upper and Lower Egypt (K. Lange and M. Hirmer, Egypt.

The analogy of king to lion is brought out in literary sources: Rameses II was referred to as the 'powerful lion with claws extended and a terrible roar'.15 The Egyptian sphinx was an extension of this symbolism. With the body of the lion and head of the king, he personified royal power: protective as a guardian force (at the entrance to temples) and destroyer of enemies. In the latter manifestation he is shown as the victorious pharoah trampling on his foes.16 Here, man and animal literally join forces in a single embodiment of domination. In Aegean iconography the parallelism between human and leonine power is expressed in alternation rather than combination. We have seen how this works on the two sides of the lion-hunt dagger and on the Mycenae Grave Stele. It is also evident in the late Cypriot ivory mirror handles from Kouklia and Enkomi with alternate themes of man against lion, lion against bull, man against griffin.17 In glyptic art the theme is expressed through the duel. The majority of such scenes pit one man against one lion.18 With one exception - a seal from Vapheio - the man wears no armour.19 In some scenes the man attacks with a weapon (dagger, sword or spear); in others he is defenceless, brawn against brawn. In the scenes with the sword/dagger the weapon is lifted high and plunged downwards to attack the head. In one instance the sword hits the lion straight in the mouth - sharp point of metal hitting the sharpness of teeth (fig. 4C). This gesture of attack is that of the warrior striking his opponent.20 It attacks at the point of maximum vulnerability - the neck - and in the case of the lion at the offensive jaws. That a parallelism was intended is evident from the gold seals in figs. 4 A and 4B. From the same Shaft Grave at Mycenae (III) they form a companion pair. The attacking hero advances from the left (in the original, rather than the impression), left leg bent forward, right arm raised with weapon poised for a downward thrust. In each case that thrust is an heroic necessity: the human opponent in fig. 4B has the advantage of shield and helmet, v while the lion in fig. 4 A already has a forepaw on the hero's leg, another around his waist, with teeth set to incapacitate his shoulder. It is the moment at which what appeared to be inevitable defeat for the hero turns into inevitable victory. This precarious poise between victory and defeat despite a known outcome is characteristic of the heroic duel. The tension of a duel depends on equality of strength. This is symbolized by the crossed swords and mirror-image pose of the two duellers in fig. 4D. Only the second, raised sword aiming down at the shoulder signals the prospective winner. In figs. 4C and E the lioness and lion attack on their hind legs, formally raising them to the stature of their human opponents (and taller), lunging forwards as the man bends backwards only to win by dint of the sword.21 The lion's back legs (especially fig. 4E) echo the lunge of the man (cf. the attacking hero in figs. 4A and B). In the Pylos sealing (fig. 4F) the two men fight the two lions without weapons, the outcome weighs in the lion's favour, yet the men's stance is again that of the attacking hero.22 The hero pits himself 15 Posener (op. cit. n. 13) 150. 16 E.g.

MORGAN: OF ANIMALS AND MEN 179 against the wild opponent in the ultimate test of courage and strength. It is contest in the raw. Only rarely does he appear with the trappings of the human world from which he comes.23 Equally, it is the force of one against one that signifies the parallelism of strength, and only rarely in Aegean glyptic do two men appear against a single lion. On a seal from Pylos, one man is defenceless, arms raised in front of the lion, while a second man comes to the rescue with a dagger, attacking from behind.24 This is defence, not confrontation, and does not fall into the category of symbolic parallelism. In another seal two men flank a lion, one with dagger at his belly, otherwise in mirror image pose. The central lion stares emblematically towards us the viewers rather than to his killer (fig. 5).25 Here the theme has shifted to that of the conquered beast. The heraldic composition transports us to the ritual sphere. In a seal from Kakovatos a hero attacks a lion (standing upright in anthropomorphism) while a Minoan genius behind him raises his paws in the ritual offering gesture over the hero's scabbard (fig. 6). He appears to be blessing the scabbard and by extension the sword so that the hero will win. What is significant about this scene is that the genius is himself lion-headed.26 A spirit in the service of the divine powers infuses the hero's weapon with the power to conquer the lion, in so doing he is partially identified with the lion, like against like. The hero, in conquering the lion, appropriates his power as the supreme hunter of the animal world. In this scene he is aided by a lion-spirit. The ritual significance of this and the previously discussed scene (fig. 5) is developed in the image in fig. 7. A sacrificial animal (deer) lies in contorted pose on the right. Two small figure-of-eight shields hover in the central field, while to the left stands a female figure with a lion-mask. As in fig. 5 the lion's head stares frontally at the spectator. It is impossible to determine whether the figure is a deity or a priestess wearing a mask, though the sacrificial context supports the latter. The elements of hunt (lion predator, deer prey), warfare (shield) and ritual (lion-woman and sacrifice) are here combined in a single evocative image. The complexity of glyptic imagery is reflected in the shift from active to passive, from hunter to hunted, from conqueror to conquered, from enemy to guardian in the iconography of the lion. The lion and lioness hunt animal prey, duel with men, are captured, skinned (?) or tied by men, the captured animal is hung upside down by genii and by men, a symbol of the trophy.27 At the same time the lion protects, as guardian of the throne, the gate, the altar, and of man. This duality in the nature of the beast is widespread in its symbolic application. Something of these roles in Egypt has been discussed in this essay. The glyptic themes we have been considering are echoed in the art of Mesopotamia, where the hero's duel with a lion is a common theme. Again, the lion rises up onto his hind legs in anthropomorphic equality (fig. 8). Man and lion may join forces in an attack against deer or bull; man may duel with a lion; or man is joined with lion in the form of a centaur to overpower the lion.28 The lion also had an apotropaic function in both Egypt and the Near East and a cylinder seal showing a hero and lion conquering a bull includes an inscription with a 23 Again symbolized through animals, now domesticated breeds; horse with chariot: CMS I, no. 302 (Pylos) and hunting dog: CMS I, no. 165 (Mycenae). 24 CMS I, no. 331 (Pylos). 25 Cf. the theme of lion bound by two men: CMS I, no. 224 (Vapheio); CMS XI, no. 165. 26 On the Minoan genius see in particular: M.A.V.

COLDSTREAM prayer for the life of the seal owner.29 It may be that a similar magical or apotropaic function was applicable to some of the Aegean images we have been considering. The symbolic role which is the subject here, that of the parallelism of nature between man and beast, is particularly widespread. Sometimes interpreted as harnessing the beast in man, this form of parallelism has more to do with appropriating the power of the beast in order that man may himself be powerful in the hunt and in war. It is the principle known to many tribal peoples whose rites of passage include killing a dangerous animal to prove manhood. The hero who overpowers the lion in Mesopotamian glyptic is identified with the legendary king Gilgamesh. On his epic journey in search of immortality, Gilgamesh (after first killing the 'Bull of Heaven' with acrobatic feats akin to those of the Cretan bull-leapers) slew the lions of the forest.30 For the rest of his treacherous journey he wore the lion's pelt. In Greek mythology, the killing of the Nemean lion was the first, initiatory, labour of Herakles in his path to immortality. He slew the beast with his bare hands and, like Gilgamesh, thereafter wore the skin as a sign of his great strength. In a depiction of his voluntary death on a pyre, which marks his passage to immortality, he lies on a lion's skin.31 The symbolism continued into Christian legend. Samson demonstrated his superhuman strength by slaying a lion with his bare hands. David, the shepherd boy who became a king, killed lions prior to the overpowering of the giant Goliath.32 In all these stories, the killing of the lion is a rite of passage, an initiatory test of strength in the passage from youth to manhood, from man to warrior and king and, on occasion, even to immortality.33 Perhaps no other creature has such a rich symbolic legacy. In Aegean art, as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the dual roles of the lion - as a strength to conquer and as a guardian - derive their inspiration from the symbolic parallelism of appropriation. In appropriating the power of the greatest of the hunter-beasts, man becomes a hero, his prowess as a hunter and warrior is assured, and his place in the hierarchy of life is protected by the animalism he controls. B. Boys and Antelopes The Theran wall-painting of the Antelopes and Boys (fig. 9) differs notably from the lion iconography we have been considering, in that its symbolic parallelism is unique. Whereas lion symbolism was international in its application and long-lived, this programme of paintings particularized parallels, exceptional in the ancient world, between youthful, ritualized sport and animal behaviour.34 Boxing is, of course, not an unknown theme in Aegean iconography. Its most celebrated example is the LM I 'Boxer Rhyton' from Ayia Triadha and later it appears on Mycenaean pictorial pottery.35 The rhyton provides a context for boxing in the world of contest sport. Divided into registers, the scenes show wrestling (top), bull vaulting (middle), and boxing (two lower registers). Here the man- 29 J.

Boxing Boys and Antelopes, wall-paintings from Bl, Akrotiri, Thera. animal contest is paralleled with competition between males involving physical strength. The two scenes of boxing are themselves paralleled by the device of placing two figures with identical posture immediately in line with one another on the vertical axis of the rhyton. Both have the long locks of the Theran Boys and wear necklaces signifying their status and the ritualization of contest. Yet these are differentiated by the fact that one wears a helmet (and most likely a boxing glove) while the other does not. Though clearly engaged in sport rather than warfare, the helmet serves as a reference to the fact that sport is a training ground for serious contest between men. Such a connection is also suggested by the Pylos sealings (figs. 4F and G) where the wrestling or boxing men (boys?) adopt the same postures as the men tackling lions, which, as we have already seen, is a metaphor for the strength of man and an initiatory event for the warrior and hero. The parallel between contest sport and warfare is more clearly presented in Middle Kingdom Egyptian tombs at Beni Hasan (fig. 10). Registers of wrestlers are juxtaposed with those of soldiers besieging a fortress and fighting their enemies.36 One of the functions of contest sport in Ancient Egypt was, in fact, as preparation for the pursuit of war.37 The ritualized nature of the sport is shown in the first few scenes of the cartoon-like strip of a wrestling pair. The two men formally face one another, one holding out his belt. In the next scene he wears the belt - which, like that of the Theran boy on the right has a loop38 - and the two bend towards each other in preparation. What follows is virtually a manual of wrestling positions. 36 P.E. Newberry, Beni Hasan Part II (London 1893) pl. V, Tomb no. 15. Cf. Tomb no. 2: idem , Beni Hasan Part I (London 1893) pls.

Their hair - blue shaved head with long locks - belt and single boxing glove, and the jewellery of the figure on the left, all signal their status and the formalization of the event. This is no spontaneous scrap or youthful play. It has been pre-arranged and is enacted in a ritualized manner. Like the duelling men, the posture indicates equality and yet we are subtly aware of the winner. The figure on the left is of higher status according to his jewellery and the blue colouration of his belt. He raises both hands to his opponent, who raises only one, and his punch (reconstruction notwithstanding) hits straight on rather than to the side. Their youth is clearly indicated by the proportions of head to body and by the belly, as well as by the peculiarly Theran convention of the shaved head and long locks.39 The programme of the room was largely concerned with pairs of antelopes, of which fig. 9 shows the best preserved. Entrance to the room from the south-east allowed one an immediate view of the juxtaposition between this pair of antelopes on the west wall and the Boxing Boys on the west corner of the south wall (fig. 11). Turning round one saw an antelope either side of the window on the north wall and another pair on the east wall. Behind the Boxers was a small room, entry to which was from a door next to the painting, which was used as the cult repositories. The position of the single pair of Boxing Boys is therefore carefully placed to stress both their ritual significance and the parallel of their behaviour with that of the adjacent Antelopes. The age of the Antelopes cannot be ascertained iconographically, though we may assume that they are not infants (because of the horns) and not old (because of the action). The parallel would make most sense if they were adolescent. The animals are hybrid, suggesting a certain unfamiliarity with this African genus. Indeed, the striking black line below the neck is derived from the Cretan wild goat, the agrimi.40 Of the many species of antelope, the facial markings are somewhat reminiscent of Oryx beisa,41 but the heavy body and straight horns preclude this identification. The closest in identification is the impala (fig. 12). With slender curvaceous body, lyrate horns on the males, facial markings (though not pronounced) and a 'distinct vertical black streak ... on ... the hindquarters'.42 Only the males have horns, so, like the Boxers, both are male. Like them too, they stand in identical pose, heads facing one another, looking eye to eye.43 Antelope behaviour has 4 a marked ritual or ceremonial element'.44 In impala, who are not territorial animals, most competition and fighting is between males for social dominance and female possession. Characteristics of these competitive fights are various 4 static phases of showing off' including a motionless position known as the 'proud posture'. The first sign of conflict is one male circling another and making intimidating gestures with his horns. One or both then show defiance by adopting the rigid, threatening posture. An invariable feature of this stage is the raised tail. An eyewitness account records 'both males stood in front of each other in "proud posture" turning their heads somewhat to the side. Now - nearly simultaneously - both males turned in the same direction and walking slowly presented their sides to each other.'45 The static display stage is followed by dynamic action - jumping and shaking horns - but the outcome is usually settled without an actual fight.

The artist has instead overlapped the bodies and turned the head of that of the left so that he looks round at his companion. But see below on the postures of antelope during competitive fighting. 44 R. Bere, Antelopes (London 1970) 50. On antelope behaviour see Bere, 50-51 and 56-7; R.

Young males, however, engage in play fighting, which has no utilitarian purpose other than as an imitative stage of maturation. They remain motionless, facing each other without touching and rotating their heads and horns as a prelude to the more excitable stages of competition. The artist has caught this ritualized contest brilliantly. How, from the vantage point of the island of Thera, we shall perhaps never know.46 But this is indeed an illustration of the 'proud posture' and the raised tails leave us in no doubt of the meaning of their mutual stare. In both Boys and Antelopes it is the most formal posture which is depicted, unambiguously expressing ritualized competition. Ritualization in animals is adaptive behaviour whose purpose is to signal intention unambiguously; to evoke a response, to effect bonding (sexual or social); and to reduce the risk of damage in competition between individuals of the same species.47 This latter, 'intra-specific aggression' as it is known, means that through changing the behaviour patterns of fighting by ritualization, there is very rarely killing or serious wounding. It is display between peers, rather than the damaging fight characteristic of the prey-predator relationship of different species. It is clear that the artist purposefully juxtaposed the Boxing Boys and the Antelopes and I think we must conclude that an unexpected knowledge of antelope behaviour is demonstrated in this parallel. There is formal comparison - in the postures, confrontation and eye contact - and there is comparison of social behaviour. The young boys, in their ritualized boxing match, playfully but significantly prepare themselves for the contests of manhood. The young male antelopes, in their ritualized competition, prepare themselves for the confrontations of adult malehood to come. Conclusion There is, I believe, a relationship between the seemingly disparate scenes of the lion-hunt and the Boxers and Antelopes. Both effect a parallel between male human and animal behaviour. Both are concerned with aggression. The fundamental difference between the two groups of scenes is that one is concerned with the reality of aggression the other with ritualized play in the service of aggression. The difference between the predator aggression of the lion attacking its prey, and the competitive aggression amongst antelopes is the same difference as the human purposeful aggression of warfare and the hunt, and combative sport such as boxing or wrestling. In the case of the lion, not only is the warrior-hunter compared to the prowess of the animal, but the two are brought together in the man-lion duel. The man thereby appropriates the power of the lion in an initiatory test of strength. In the case of the Boxing Boys and the Antelopes, we see a pre-initiatory form of play which is to lead to more serious tests of strength in the future. Both parallels between man and animal / boy and animal function within the compass of the process of maturation and the development of adult male prowess within society. 46 Antelopes were certainly in evidence in Egypt. They are mentioned in 18th Dynasty lists of offerings and appear earlier in reliefs and wall-paintings at Saqqara, Beni Hasan and elsewhere. W.J. Darby, P. Ghalioungui, L.
