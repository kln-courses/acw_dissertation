<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unorthodoxy in Costa Rica Before the Conquistadores came to Costa Rica, the area between Cartago and the Irazu Volcano in the central plateau was inhabited by the Guetar Indians. Not only do Spanish records attest to this fact, but many Precolumbian Gue- tar relics have been found in the area, several of which attest to the unique, even unorthodox, style of the artist who fashioned them. 153</page><page sequence="2">Grave group from Tierra Blanca. Spindle whorl at left. Ex- ternal diameter 54/55 mm. Diameter of orifice, 11/12 mm. Intact bowl with decoration of two frogs, which are sym- bols of fertility and to right a stone figure of an owl with folded wings, the only known specimen of its kind. From a cornfield in Retes (Car- tago) came an anthropomorphic jar. Its "coffee bean" eyes, the con- struction of the teeth, nose and eye- brows are similar to jars of the early classic period ( A.D. 200-500) in Teotihuacan. The scrolls, even to the number of dots, the nose and the ornamental ears are like those found in a Teotihuacan fresco of Tlaloc, a celestial god in Meso- america. On the back of the neck of our jar is an undulating line sig- nifying water. These facts point to the identification of the jar as Tlaloc, whom we know was estab- lished in the Teotihuacan pantheon before the Mayans adopted him as a rain god. However, the jar lacks the hafted-axe eyes of the Mayan god, an indication that Tlaloc may have come to Costa Rica directly through Teotihuacan instead of from the Mayans whose religion had otherwise a very strong influ- ence on the Guetars. From Tierra Blanca comes a spin- dle whorl which was found in a tomb made of stone slabs, with sherds, bowls and a stone figure of an owl in addition to the remains of the skeleton. The near perfec- tion of the circular elements of the whorl is noteworthy when one con- siders that no compasses were used. Well executed spheres have also been found in Golfite, Costa Rica. The American Indians knew the wheel as a decorative element and in the miniature to pull toys. Only the Aztecs and Guetar Indians used spindle whorls but none of the Indians used the wheel for trans- portation as they did not have draft animals. A partially preserved rattle was found on a dirt road which links Tierra Blanca with Sanatorio Carlos Duran; a search for the figure's legs was unsuccessful. Details such as the round indentations in the coif are characteristic of Guetar art. The form of the anguished eyes, beady, round and made by simple perforations, date the piece to the archaic period (1500 B.c.). A hole in its neck indicates the rattle was worn from the neck, probably by an officiating priest or witch doctor. The figure represents a woman in the advanced stage of pregnancy as evidenced by the prom- inent abdomen, protruding navel and dilated vulva. On the top of the head and over the spine is a cylindrical coil which probably rep- resents a snake. If we combine the pregnancy, the snake and the cere- monial character of the rattle, this figure can be tentatively identified as the Mayan Goddess Ixchel, wife of Itzamma, Lord of the Heavens, in her beneficial personification as the goddess of pregnancy. If this identification is correct, this figure establishes the presence of Ixchel among the Guetar Indians.
