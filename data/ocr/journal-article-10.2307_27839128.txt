<plain_text><page sequence="1">Volatile Silicon Compounds by E. A. V. Ebsworth; 179 pages; $7.50; The Macmillan Co., Per gam?n, 1963. (Vol. IV of International Series of Monographs on Inorganic Chemis try). This is an entertaining book. Odd and unexpected information pops out at the reader, along with an excellent and con cise summary of the behavior of the volatile compounds of the Group IV 342A elements. There is a great deal about quadrupole coupling constants, force constants, paramagnetic terms, and ex cited-state mixing. The book is mostly a discussion about why chemical bonds to silicon and its congeners are as long or as short as they are, and why a re action follows Path A rather than Path B. This is an informal and chatty book. It is purposely full of personal opinions, such as: "Electronegativity is one of those irritating concepts like covalent character which sound as if they mean very much more than they do." Later, regarding the behavior of substituted silanes toward standard reagents used to deduce the effect of substitution at silicon; "Unfortunately this is usually a pious hope rather than a profitable ex ercise." Some of the opinions are backed up by a unique and extremely helpful summary of descriptive chemistry, as in the excellent chapter on the silicon hydrogen bond, which is replete with the latest measurements of coupling constants and chemical shifts (many of them heretofore unpublished). The author comes to the conclusion that "There is no general correlation between chemical shift and vibration frequency for SiH bonds, although in certain series of compounds it may be possible to dis cover empirical relationships between the two properties." In other instances the firm opinions of the author are re futed by his own facts. For example, in a discussion of the bond lengths in the methyl compounds of silicon, german ium, and tin, the author states that "Although the precise values for the M-C bond lengths obtained from the mono methyls do not agree very well with the sums of the appropriate covalent radii, the agreement is greatly improved by the Schomaker and Stevenson electronega tivity correction." Actually, the agree ment is improved in one case (Si) and worsened in the other two (Ge and Sn), as shown in Table 4.1 As for the state ment "Germanium (II) is rather ill defined," (p. 4) this will be news to the international suppliers of germanium who offer GeF2, GeCl2, GeBr2, and Gel2 as articles of commerce, and can furnish GeO 99.999 per cent pure.</page><page sequence="2">This will be a controversial book. The author chooses to ignore recent Russian books like Petrov, Mironov, Pono marenko, and Chernyshev, and sticks to his own sources. Your reviewer made a long list of points on which he himself differs sharply with Ebsworth, and another list where he complains that Ebsworth simply slides over facts such as the reaction of organolithium com pounds with GeH producing GeLi and RH whereas SiH produces SiR and LiH. Some readers will also find fault with the English: Liable is used for likely, if instead of whether, and disproportiona tion instead of condensation. The author also is given to anthropomorphic usage: "silicon prefers," "iodosilane appears reluctant," and so on. This is conversa tional usage today, and it flows natu rally into the book. At the same time, American editors and teachers decry this sort of thing. In the days of Pygma lion the British were the guardians of the language; now there is a stronger rear-guard action being fought over here, with just as little success. This is a good book and an important one, so practically everyone in inorganic chemistry will want to own it. Each reader will find his own stimulation in it. Chemistry is so vast and diffuse these days that no one man can know all the facts about a field, much less comment on those facts. Yet Ebbs worth comes closer than anyone else to accom plishing just that for the volatile com pounds of silicon. The book is recom mended.?Eugene G. Rochow</page></plain_text>
