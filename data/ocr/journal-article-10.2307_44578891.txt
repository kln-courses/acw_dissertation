<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAOS IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES AND ITS NERONIAN INFLUENCE* RICHARD TARRANT For Elaine Fantham Like so much else in Ovid's Metamorphoses , the concept of chaos that opens the poem is inherited rather than invented. The notion of a primordial chaos of some kind is at least as old as Hesiod, and Ovid probably had a Hellenistic precedent for using chaos as the starting point of a collective poem,1 but among literary descriptions of this state, Ovid's account both is the most detailed and has been the most broadly influential. Its influence on Latin poets of late antiquity is one theme of Michael Roberts's article elsewhere in this volume. At a much later time and in a different medium, Ovid's description almost certainly lies behind the astonishing "Representa- tion of Chaos" ("Vorstellung des Chaos") that serves as the prelude to Haydn's Creation. The title of this paper reflects its twofold aims. The first is to argue that chaos in Ovid's Metamorphoses is not limited to the poem's opening episode but has a pervasive presence in the poem, both in the physical world and, more significantly, in the moral lives of human beings. My second * Some of the material in this paper has been presented to audiences in Princeton, Palermo, Lexington, Virginia, and New York. I am grateful to my listeners on those occasions for many helpful comments and suggestions. 1 Both the song of Silenus in Virgil Eel. 6.3 Iff. and the song of Clymene in G. 4.345-47 combine a number of mythological episodes with an opening section on chaos (this seems the natural import of G. 4.347: "aque chao densos diuum numerabat amores," "she was relating the numerous loves of the gods from chaos onward"), and it seems likely that these references reflect the structure and content of a lost Hellenistic or neoteric poem or poems. 349 Arethusa 35 (2002) 349-360 © 2002 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">350 Richard Tarrant purpose is briefly to trace the influence of this expanded notion of chaos in two of Ovid's particularly strong and attentive Neronian readers, Seneca and Lucan. My focus might therefore seem to be at least as much on Ovid as on his reception, but it is in fact precisely by looking at the Metamorphoses from a Neronian perspective that we can most clearly see this facet of Ovid's work. Ovid's chaos is marked above all by instability of form and confu- sion of boundaries; note in particular Metamorphoses 1.7: rudis indigestaque moles ("a rough unordered mass"),2 8-9: "congestaque eodem / non bene iunctarum discordia semina rerum" ("heaped together / the discordant seeds of unassembled things"), 17: nulli sua forma manebat, ("no part maintained its form"). Two other distinguishing features are darkness and conflict: for the first, cf. caeco . . . aceruo ("from their dark heap," 24) and caligine caeca ("in thick darkness," 70);3 for the second, cf. frigida pugnabant calidis ("the cold were fighting with the hot," 19) and "hanc deus et melior litem natura diremit" ("God, or more kindly Nature, settled this dispute," 21). Corre- spondingly, the divine activity of creation consists in separating the ele- ments, putting an end to their strife, and assigning a fixed place to each of them; cf. 22-25: "nam caelo terras et terris abscidit undas / et liquidum spisso secreuit ab aere caelum; / quae postquam euoluit caecoque exemit aceruo, / dissociata locis concordi pace ligauit" ("for from the sky he split the lands and from the lands the waves, / and divided the clear sky from the misty air. / And after unfolding these and drawing them from their dark heap, / he bound them in their separate places with harmonious peace"), 32- 33: "dispositam . . . / congeriem secuit, sectamque in membra redegit" ("divided &lt;the mass&gt; and, once it was divided, forced it into parts"), 69: limitibus dissaepserat omnia certis ("he had . . . marked all things off within their sure limits"). Read in isolation, Ovid's creation story leaves the impression that primeval chaos yields, definitively and finally, to cosmos. But as Ovid's poem continues, the clear-cut divisions established at the outset are undone or threatened at several levels. In the poem's early books, the boundaries 2 Translations of the Metamorphoses are from Hill 1985-2000. Translations not otherwise attributed are my own. 3 The manuscripts disagree here: most read "cum quae pressa diu massa latuere sub illa" ("after lying long hidden beneath that mass"), but two important older witnesses give "cum quae pressa diu fuerant caligine caeca" ("after lying long hidden in thick darkness"), which seems preferable.</page><page sequence="3">Chaos in Oviďs Metamorphoses 351 between the elements themselves are breached in ways that reverse the original act of creation: Jupiter's flood obliterates the distinction between earth and water (cf. 1 .291 : "iamque mare et tellus nullum discrimen habebant," "and now the sea and land had no distinction"), and Phaethon's disastrous ride in the Sun-god's chariot comes near to returning the world to chaos, as stated in the lament of Tellus at 2.298-99: "si freta, si terrae pereunt, si regia caeli, / in chaos antiquum confundimur" ("if the seas and the lands and the palace of heaven perish, / we are sunk into primaeval Chaos"). The verb confundimur is especially noteworthy, suggesting the collapse of boundaries keeping the realms of the cosmos distinct. We hear a more distant echo of this theme in Book 5 at the start of the song of Calliope: the Giants' assault on heaven makes Pluto fear that the earth's foundations may have crumbled, leaving the Underworld open to view (cf. 5.356-58: "inde tremit tellus, et rex pauet ipse silentum, / ne pateat latoque solum retegatur hiatu / immissusque dies trepidantes terreat umbras," "then the earth shuddered and the king of the silent ones himself was afraid / that the ground would open and be revealed in a wide crack / and that daylight would be let in and terrify the trembling shades"). By clustering these real or potential convulsions of the cosmic structure in the first third of the poem, Ovid suggests the vulnerability of the cosmos in its early stages, and thus strengthens his poem's illusion of chronological progression. At a less literal but more fundamental level, any sense that the act of creation has produced a world in which forms are fixed and stable is negated by the entire poem's focus on mutatae formae ("changed forms," 1.1-2). Furthermore, in the final book of the poem, the instability of all forms is propounded by Pythagoras as a law of nature (15.252-53: "nec species sua cuique manet, rerumque nouatrix / ex aliis alias reparat natura figuras," "and none maintains its own appearance, but the innovatress of things, / nature, restores one shape from another"). Pythagoras's precept is phrased in a way that pointedly recalls the description of chaos at the opening of the poem, nulli sua forma manebat, "no part maintained its form" (1.17). What appeared there as an aberrant pre-cosmic state is now alleged to be the constant and universal condition of nature. The point is underscored verbally by the shift in tense from manebat in 1.17, describing what was not yet the case, to the timeless manet of 15.252. So a first conclusion is that chaos in the Metamorphoses is not merely a temporary phase in the evolution of the physical world but a more permanent aspect of that world. Now I want to go a step further and to suggest that the concept of</page><page sequence="4">352 Richard Tarrant chaos, especially as it denotes the blurring or collapsing of boundaries, also figures prominently in Ovid's depiction of human behavior, particularly in the central books of the poem. Here I will be arguing analogically or even metaphorically, but I think that a plausible case can be made from within the Metamorphoses itself and that it receives powerful support from a Neronian text strongly influenced by the Metamorphoses , namely, Seneca's Thyestes. In the large-scale architecture of the Metamorphoses , the sixth book marks a transition from stories in which the gods play the leading roles to stories driven primarily by human actions and emotions. The first such episode is the brutal tale of Procne, Tereus, and Philomela, and I do not think it is accidental that this is also the story that offers the closest analogy in the moral sphere to the chaos that opened the poem. The episode is structured around Tereus's rape of his sister-in-law Philomela and the horrible revenge exacted for this crime by Philomela and her sister Procne, who kill Tereus's son Itys and serve him to his unsuspecting father. Ovid explicitly character- izes both the crime and its planned punishment in terms that evoke elemen- tal confusion: cf. 6.537-38 (Philomela to Tereus): "omnia turbasti: paelex ego facta sororis, / tu geminus coniunx +hostis mihi debita poena+," "you have overturned everything; I am made my sister's supplanter, / you a double husband, I deserve a foe's punishment"4 and 585-86 (Procne setting out to rescue her sister): "fasque nefasque / confusura ruit poenaeque in imagine tota est," "she . . . rushed on to confound / right and wrong and was all engrossed in the idea of punishment." In the latter passage, the themati- cally significant verb confundere , seen in 2.299 above, now functions to describe the blurring of moral categories. The Procne-Tereus episode displays two other "chaotic" aspects. One is the feeling of darkness that pervades it, a darkness that operates on both the literal and the metaphorical level. In literal terms, the episode contains only a single passing reference to daylight (494: lux erat , "it was 4 The text of 538 is seriously disturbed; hostis mihi debita poena ("I deserve a foe's punishment") can hardly be sound, and no variant or conjecture is convincing. The possibility that both it and the previous line are interpolated cannot be ruled out: the paelex sororis ("my sister's rival or supplanter") motif appears later in the episode at 606: paelex sibi uisa sororis ("seeming to herself to be her sister's supplanter") where it would carry much more point if it had not been so closely anticipated shortly before. On the other hand, the thought in omnia turbasti ("you have overturned everything") is perfectly appropriate to the context, and the expression contains no grounds for suspicion. If the lines are interpolated, their author has made more overt an idea implicit in Ovid's narrative. (On "collaborative interpolation" of this kind, see Tarrant 1989a.)</page><page sequence="5">Chaos in Oviďs Metamorphoses 353 light"), while the narrative evocatively dwells on the arrival of night (486- 87: "iam labor exiguus Phoebo restabat equique / pulsabant pedibus spatium decliuis Olympi," "by now very little toil was left for Phoebus, and his horses / were pounding the slope down from Olympus with their feet"), the dark wood where Tereus rapes Philomela (520: "rex Pandione natam / in stabula alta trahit siluis obscura uetustis," "the king dragged Pandion's / daughter into a high pen hidden in ancient woods"), and the nighttime rescue of Philomela by Procne (588-90: "nox conscia sacris, / nocte sonat Rhodope tinnitibus aeris acuti, / nocte sua est egressa domo regina," "night witnessed their rites, / by night Rhodope resounded with the ringing of sharp bronze, / by night the queen emerged from her house"). Still more notewor- thy are the prominent references to figurative darkness that frame the story (472-73: "pro superi, quantum mortalia pectora caecae / noctis habent," "ye gods, how much dark night there is / in mortal breasts!"; 652: tantaque nox animi est , "so great was the night in his mind"). The fact that both passages are outbursts in the voice of the narrator, and that the first one speaks in general terms of "human hearts" ( mortalia pectora), suggests that the "chaotic" features of this episode may be applicable to Ovid's treatment of human behavior in general. Another aspect of the story that supports the analogy with chaos is the part in it played - or rather not played - by the gods: as the original move from chaos to order was brought about by divine intervention (1.21: deus et melior . . . natura , "god, or more kindly Nature"), here the painful absence of divine involvement marks the reappearance of chaos in the moral sphere. At the start of the episode, the gods of marriage are pointedly absent from the union of Procne and Tereus, their place being taken by the Eumênides (6.428-32). After her rape, Philomela puts the very existence of the gods in question: "si tarnen haec superi cernunt, si numina diuum / sunt aliquid, si non perierunt omnia mecum, / quandocumque mihi poenas dabis" ("if, even so, the gods see this, if the divine powers / are something, if everything has not perished with me, / at some time I shall see you pay the penalty," 6.542-44). Philomela does obtain her revenge, but it is abetted by no god and hardly constitutes a restoration of moral order. Before deciding to kill her child, Procne must resolve a brief but agonizing conflict between her feelings as mother and sister (6.624-35). Procne's dilemma, and the brief monologue in which it is stated, look forward to a series of later episodes in which female characters experience similar conflicts, usually between love in one of its forms and a sense of duty or morality. Examples include Medea in Book 7, Scylla and Althaea in Book 8, Byblis in Book 9, and Myrrha in Book 10. In some of these situations</page><page sequence="6">354 Richard Tarrant where the normal separation of roles and responsibilities breaks down, Ovid's language again evokes his description of elemental strife and confu- sion, with the difference that the elements now in question are human categories such as "mother" and "sister" or "daughter" and "wife." Thus of Althaea, torn between love of her son Meleager and devotion to her brothers whom he has killed, Ovid says pugnant materque sororque ("mother and sister fought," 8. 463), 5 and when Myrrha tries to argue herself out of the passion she feels for her father Cinyras, she uses the same verb, confundere , that we have seen twice before, once of physical and once of moral collapse: "quot confundas et iura et nomina sentis?" ("can you ... not understand how many rights and names you are confounding?" 10.346; cf. 2.299, 6.586). The connection I am suggesting between elemental and human chaos is made easier by the fact that Ovid's primal chaos was already characterized in human terms, especially by the language of antagonism or open conflict.6 Indeed, we might conclude that one reason for Ovid to choose this imagery was precisely to ground an analogy between elemental confusion and the corresponding phenomenon in the human sphere. Although the middle books of the Metamorphoses contain the closest human parallels to elemental chaos, the human potential for chaotic behavior was signaled near the beginning of the poem in Ovid's account of the Age of Iron (Met. 1.127-50). In addition to perversions of human relationships (e.g., 146: "imminet exitio uir coniugis, ilia mariti," "the man is bent on the death of his wife and she on her husband's"), the passage also hints at the overturning of natural boundaries as "wealth hidden in Stygian shadows" is hauled into view (139-40) and sons inquire into their fathers' lifespans "before the proper time," ante diem (148). By a trick of narratorial sleight-of-hand, this description is set in the remote past before the Flood but bears a strong resemblance to Rome in Ovid's own day. The implication may be that the capacity for moral chaos is a continuing fact of human life.7 5 Most manuscripts read pugnai ; I prefer the variant pugnant because it dramatizes Althaea's internal conflict more vividly. 6 Ovid's anthropomorphic view of chaos can be usefully contrasted with the much more abstract picture in Virgil Eel. 6.31-34: "namque canebat uti magnum per inane coacta / semina terrarumque animaeque marisque fuissent / et liquidi simul ignis; ut his ex omnia primis, / omnia et ipse tener mundi concreuerit orbis" ("for he sang of how in vast empty space / had been gathered the seeds of earth and air and sea / along with the pure fire; how from these first things / came all else, all, and the soft globe itself of the sky took shape"). 7 I am grateful to Giancarlo Mazzoli for making me aware of the relevance of Ovid's Iron Age description.</page><page sequence="7">Chaos in Ovid's Metamorphoses 355 I turn at last to Seneca and Lucan, where the parallel that Ovid establishes between human passions and natural disorder becomes both explicit and actual. In responding to this aspect of the Metamorphoses , Seneca and Lucan bring to bear not only their distinctive poetic personalities but also a shared framework of Stoic cosmological thought. This Neronian reading of Ovid is most clearly represented by Seneca's Thy estes. Ovid's story of Procne, Tereus, and Philomela serves as a direct precedent and model for the plot of Seneca's play. In the Prologue, the Fury, in typically allusive terms, calls for the "Thracian crime" to be re- enacted with a larger number of victims (56-57: "Thracium fiat nefas / maiore numero," "the Thracian crime / must be performed again, but with more victims"). In the following scene, Atreus recalls the same event and then openly appeals to his Ovidian counterparts for inspiration in devising a revenge that will surpass their achievement: "uidit infandas domus / Odrysia mensas - fateor, immane est scelus, / sed occupatum: maius hoc aliquid dolor / inueniat. animum Daulis inspira parens / sororque; causa est similis, assiste et manům / impelle nostrani" ("the Thracian house once saw / a shameful feast ... to be sure, a dreadful crime, / but one already thought of; my revenge / must fashion something more. Procne and Philomela, / mother and sister, inspire me: my case / resembles yours, stand by me and guide my hand," 272-77). This extraordinary passage alternates collaborative and competitive language in a way that suggests a link between Atreus and Seneca himself, expressing with rare directness both Seneca's sense of indebtedness to Ovid and his (perhaps never to be fulfilled) longing to outdo his predecessor.8 Furthermore, by engaging so directly with Ovid in a play that is to some degree also in dialogue with another Augustan masterwork, Varius's Thy estes, Seneca raises the emulative stakes still higher.9 Atreus's success can be measured by the cosmic consequences of his act: Thyestes' banquet puts the sun to flight and throws nature into turmoil, leading the terrified chorus to fear the onset of a cataclysm that will return the world to primordial confusion: "trepidant, trepidant pectora magno / percussa metu, / ne fatali cuneta ruina / quassata labent iterumque déos / hominesque premat deforme chaos, / iterum terras et mare cingens / et uaga picti sidera mundi / 8 Schiesaro 1994 touches on the metatheatrical aspect of Seneca's treatment; see also Tarrant 1985.129-30 (on lines 272-77). A forthcoming study by Schiesaro develops this line of interpretation in greater depth. 9 Despite the arguments of Lefèvre 1976, it seems very likely that Varius's play dramatized the same mythic events as Seneca's.</page><page sequence="8">356 Richard Tarrant natura teg at" ("my heart trembles, trembles, / struck with great dread / that the shattered world / may sink in its fated ruin / and that shapeless chaos / may once again overwhelm / both gods and men, / and that once again nature / may cover the lands / and the encircling sea / and the wandering stars of the spangled sky," 828-35). The lines have clear connections to the opening lines of the Metamorphoses , of which the most interesting is the inverted echo of Ovid's quod tegit omnia caelum ("the sky that covers all," 1.5) in ne . . . sidera mundi /natura tegat ("that nature may cover the stars of the sky"). In a typically brilliant adaptation of his predecessor, Seneca brings together the literal and metaphorical dimensions of Ovid's chaos, reverses their Ovidian sequence, and establishes a causal connection be- tween them. In Ovid, moral chaos follows and seems to replicate physical chaos; in Seneca, it is the chaotic impulses of human beings that have the power, at least potentially, to induce the physical dissolution of the world. In keeping with this internalized perspective focusing on human emotions, the other defining features of Ovid's chaos - darkness, conflict, and absence of divine intervention - all recur in Thy estes in connection with Atreus and his revenge plot: it is Atreus whose actions cause the earth to be engulfed by unnatural darkness, Atreus who says contemptuously dimitto superos ("I can dismiss the gods," 888), and it is within the soul of Atreus that the play's most intense conflict is waged. Ovid's chaos plays a similarly programmatic role at the start of Lucan's epic. After Lucan has introduced the theme of his poem on the civil war and has called on Nero (in a highly equivocal way) for inspiration, he begins his narrative proper as follows: "fert animus causas tantarum expromere rerum" ("my spirit leads me to reveal the causes of such great events," 1 .67). 10 The expression fert animus at the start of an epic must recall the opening words of Ovid's Metamorphoses : "in noua fert animus mutatas dicere formas / corpora" ("my spirit moves me to tell of shapes changed into strange / bodies"). This echo is in itself highly suggestive. Could Lucan be implying that his own poem is a story of metamorphosis, the transformation of Rome from republican freedom to slavery under Julius Caesar?11 If so, Lucan could be writing a sort of revision of Ovid, since the Metamorphoses itself ends with Julius Caesar's death and deification, which Ovid ostensibly 10 Translations of Lucan are from Braund 1992. 1 1 The idea of a political or moral transformation of Rome is found elsewhere, e.g., in Sallust Cat. 10.6: ciuitas immutata ("the city was changed").</page><page sequence="9">Chaos in Ovid's Metamorphoses 357 regards as the prelude to an era of peace and restored freedom under Augustus.12 But even as such thoughts may be forming in a reader's mind, Lucan provides a more specific link to the Metamorphoses , comparing the collapse of Rome to the return of primordial chaos (1.72-80). sic, cum compage soluta saecula tot mundi suprema coegerit hora, antiquum repetens iterum chaos, [omnia mixtis sidera sideribus concurrent,] ignea pontům astra petent, tellus extendere litora noiet excutietque fretum, fratri contraria Phoebe ibit et obliquum bigas agitare per orbem indignata diem poscet sibi, totaque discors machina diuolsi turbabit foedera mundi. So, when the final hour brings to an end the long ages of the universe, its structure dissolved, reverting to primeval chaos, then fiery stars will plunge into the sea, the earth will be unwilling to stretch flat her shores and will shake the water off, Phoebe will confront her brother and for herself demand the day, resentful of driving her chariot along its slanting orbit, and the whole discordant mechanism of universe torn apart will disrupt its own laws. The idea that the cosmos undergoes periodic cataclysm is part of the Stoic thinking that so strongly influenced Lucan, but his use of the notion here is shaped at least as much by poetic as by philosophical motives. Chaos is where Ovid's poem begins, and Lucan's lines contain one phrase that both recalls part of Ovid's description and pointedly reverses its meaning. In Lucan 1.76, the imagery of the earth being unwilling to "stretch out" 12 On this aspect of Lucan's relation to Ovid, see the remarks of Stephen Wheeler elsewhere in this volume.</page><page sequence="10">358 Richard Tarrant (&lt; extendere ) the shores of the sea is the inverse of Ovid's picture in Metamor- phoses 1 . 1 3-14 of a time when the sea had not yet "stretched out" ( porrexerat ) its arms along the rim of the lands. More generally, Lucan's lines put the Ovidian progression of chaos-to-cosmos into reverse. If a direct relationship between the two passages is accepted, we might be tempted to see a double meaning in Lucan's reference to antiquum . . . chaos in 1.74: not just "primeval" chaos, but chaos as previously described by Ovid.13 Two features of Ovid's account of chaos that have been mentioned earlier make Lucan's reference to the episode especially fitting. The first is the blurring of boundaries and the confusion of categories, most clearly expressed in the words "nulli sua forma manebat / obstabatque aliis aliud" ("no part maintained its form, / and one impeded the others," Met. 1 .17-1 8). The second is the depiction of chaos in terms that evoke dispute and conflict, such as pugnare and lis {Met. 1.19 and 2 1 ; also pace in 1 .25). Ovid describes physical chaos with the metaphor of human warfare; Lucan inverts the relationship in order to characterize real civil war in terms reminiscent of Ovidian chaos. The confusion of categories that is one hallmark of Ovidian chaos also provides a suitable thematic backdrop for an epic that systemati- cally explores the inversions generated by "legitimacy conferred on crime" (ius . . . datum sceleri , 1 .2). In themselves, Lucan's references to the opening of the Metamorphoses might seem to reinterpret Ovid's physical conception of chaos in human and moral terms. It has been my aim to argue that Lucan's use of chaos as an analogy for the breakdown of human institutions responds to something already present in Ovid's poem. Both Seneca and Lucan also employ the image of primordial chaos in describing a sea-storm: Ag. 485-87 (the Messenger describing the Greeks' return from Troy): "mundum reuelli sedibus totum suis / ipsosque rupto crederes caelo deos / decidere et atrum rebus induci chaos" ("you would have thought the entire universe / torn from its place, the very gods falling / from the broken sky, and black chaos brought / upon the world"), Lucan BC 5.634-36 (the storm that envelops Caesar as he attempts to cross to Italy): "extimuit natura chaos; rupisse uidentur / concordes elementa moras, rursusque redire / nox manes mixtura deis" ("nature dreaded chaos; it seems the elements / have burst their harmonious checks and night again / returns to mix the dead with gods"). A weak interpretation would explain this use of chaos by invoking Neronian hyperbole or a penchant for apocalyptic imag- 13 The doubled iterum of Sen. Thy. 831 and 833 might bear a similar allusive sense.</page><page sequence="11">Chaos in Ovid's Metamorphoses 359 ery; a somewhat stronger one would see here a broader application of Ovid's "when the world was young" motif, perhaps colored by Stoic ideas of recurrent cataclysm. One resulting implication of the Neronian passages is that threats to cosmic order are not limited to any period in the past, and that the order of things is perpetually vulnerable. Although my primary focus has been on Ovid's primordial chaos, before concluding I would like to mention another use of the concept for which Ovid's practice is formative for Neronian writers, i.e., chaos as a synonym for "the Underworld." There is a natural link between chaos and the Underworld: Hesiod's chaos is probably situated beneath the earth and is the parent of Nyx and Erebos, which are themselves often located in the Underworld. Two of Virgil's three references to chaos associate it with other Underworld entities ( Aen . 4.5 10-1 1 : "ter centum tonat ore deos, Erebumque Chaosque / tergeminamque Hecaten," "she invokes three hundred gods, Erebus and Chaos and three-formed Hecate") and 6.264-65: "Di, quibus imperium est animarum, umbraeque silentes / et Chaos et Phlegethon, loca nocte tacentia late" ("you gods who hold sway over the spirits, you mute shades, and Chaos and Phlegethon, the places far and wide that lie silent in night"), but Ovid is apparently the first writer to make chaos a quasi- synonym for Tartarus or Erebus. The shift is seen most clearly in Metamor- phoses 10.29-30 (Orpheus's plea to the Underworld powers): "per ego haec loca plena timoris, / per chaos hoc ingens uastique silentia regni" ("through the fearful places, / through this huge Chaos and the silence of this vast realm") and 14.403-04 (Circe casting a spell): "et Noctem Noctisque deos Ereboque Chaoque / conuocat" ("she . . . summoned Night and Night's gods from both Erebos / and Chaos"), which rework the Virgilian passages just cited while altering the sense of chaos.14 This conception of chaos accounts for the majority of Seneca's uses of the term; in some cases, a specific Ovidian allusion is probably intended, as when Medea invokes the powers of the Underworld in language that evokes both Dido's priestess and Ovid's Circe {Med. 740-41: "comprecor uulgus silentum uosque ferales deos / et chaos caecum atque opacam Ditis umbrosi domum," "I pray to the host of silent ones, and to you funereal gods, / to dark Chaos and the impenetrable 14 In Aen. 6.265, it is possible to read loca nocte tacentia late as an appositional phrase, not as defining Phlegethon and Chaos; the result can be seen in Austin's paraphrase ad loc., "the gods who rule the ghosts, and the silent ghosts themselves, and primeval Chaos, and all the bleak world of everlasting darkness." Ovid's word order makes chaos hoc ingens a clear equivalent to haec loca plena timoris.</page><page sequence="12">360 Richard Tarrant house of shadowy Dis").15 Lucan also employs chaos in this sense, and one instance merits a closer look as an example of Lucan' s subtlety in using Ovidian material. After Pompey's death, his wife Cornelia addresses him and vows to take her own life so that she can follow him to the lower world: "iam nunc te per inane chaos, per Tartara, coniunx, / si sunt ulla, sequar" ("but now, husband, I will follow you through empty Chaos, / through Tartarus, if any such exists," 9.101-02). In their wording, the lines resemble the frenzied wish of Seneca's Phaedra to follow Hippolytus in death ( Phae . 1 179-80: "et te per undas teque per Tartáreos lacus, / per Styga, per amnes Ígneos amens sequar," "across the water and the lakes of Tartarus, / across Styx and the rivers of fire I will follow you"),16 but Cornelia's nobler tone and steadfast loyalty may evoke as well Ovid's Orpheus appealing to the gods of the Underworld to release his beloved Eurydice (Met. 10.29-30, quoted above). It would be typical of Lucan to recall this Ovidian passage while reversing both the roles played by the characters and the wish being expressed. Lucan had already drawn on Ovid to convey the depth of Cornelia's devotion to Pompey when, in Book 5, he has her protest Pompey's decision to send her to Lesbos in language that frequently echoes that of Ovid's Alcyone. But to explore those connections belongs to another paper, per- haps to be called "Ovid and the Invention of Romantic Love."17 I have tried to demonstrate the potency of chaos, especially in its human and moral aspect, as a metaphor, both in the Metamorphoses and in two of Ovid's most eminent successors. The uses of Ovidian chaos by Seneca and Lucan offer a new perspective on several characteristically Neronian preoccupations, including boundary violation, instability at the human and cosmic level, and post- Augustan belatedness anxiety. They also exemplify the Neronian habit of articulating those themes through dark readings of the canonical works of Augustan literature. Harvard University 15 Translation from Hine 2000. In his note ad loc., Hine writes that, "in this invocation it is clear that Chaos is a deity," but Chaos need no more be a deity than the Ditis domus with which it is juxtaposed. 16 The lines are bracketed in Zwierlein's Oxford text as a feeble repetition of 700-01 : "te uel per ignes, per mare insanum sequar / rupesque et amnes" ("I will follow you through fire, through the raging sea, / over crags and streams"). 17 Many of the Ovidian echoes in the scene are documented in Bruère 1951, but Bruère's analysis is hampered by his negative view of Lucanian rhetoric.</page></plain_text>
