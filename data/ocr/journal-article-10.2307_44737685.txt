<plain_text><page sequence="1">SALT MAY, 19 77 Procedures for Increasing Four Behaviorally Defined Components of Creativity Within Formal Written Assignments Among High School Students JOHN A. GLOVER The University of Nebraska ana FRED SAUTTER The University of Cincinnatti Abstract Reinforcement (points toward a course grade), directions and practice were applied to the written work of 31 high school juniors ana seniors on four operationally aefinea components of creative responding, fluency, the number of different forms of responses; elaboration, the number of words per response; and originality, the statistical infrequency of re- sponses. All four components were aemonstratea to be unaer experimental control. The procedures also raisea stuaents' scores on Torrance's tests of creativity. Application of the procedures for classroom teachers seems practical and straightforward. 3</page><page sequence="2">SALT GLOVER ana SAUTTER Recent investigations (Glover &amp; Gary, 1976; Maloney &amp; Hopkins, 1973) have aemonstrated the feasibility of modifying operationally defined com- ponents of creative writing behaviors in artificially structured classroom situations employing approxi- mations of the Good Behavior Game (Barrish, Saunders &amp; Wolf, 1969). Other experimenters have also demonstrated the possibilities of modifying creative responses via instructions to be novel pairea with contingent reinforcement of verbal novelty in dif- ferent situations (Maltzman, Bogartz &amp; Bregar, 1958; Maltzman, Simon, Raskin &amp; Licht, i960), through the use of programmed materials prepared to enhance problem solving (Reese &amp; Parnés, 1972), through the reinforcement of individual production of new block- building forms (Goetz &amp; Baer, 1971; 1973) and through descriptive reinforcement of new painting forms (Goetz &amp; Salmonson, 1972; Fallon &amp; Goetz, 1975 )• Among the most interesting of the demonstrated changes in levels of creative responding was that reported by Maloney &amp; Hopkins (1973) wherein they increased the levels of creative writing among elementary school children via contingency management. Torrance (197*0 identified fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality as four components of creative behavior. Glover &amp; Gary (I976) demonstrated that these components may be subjected to operational- ization ana behavior analysis. The current stuay attempts to modify operationally defined equivalents of Torrance's four components of creative behavior in the written work of a high school psychology class and to relate these operationally defined variables to subjects ' scores on the Torrance Thinking Creatively With Words Test. k</page><page sequence="3">SALT INCREASING CREATIVITY Method Participants and .Setting Thirty-one junior and senior students enrolled in an elective course during the sixteen week Fall semester at a comprehensive, integrated Mia-Southern high school participated in the study. Students were 17 females and Ik males. Ages ranged from 15 years Ô months to 10 years 2 months. Students' grade point averages ranged from 2.16 to 3.91 with a mean of 2.91 out of a possible i». 00. All the students occupied the same classroom at the same time. The students' activities were vinder the direction of the in- structor, who was assisted by an aide, the ex- perimenter. General Procedures One-half of the course grade for each stu- dent consisted of the results of 15 weekly papers written about a concept assigned the class on a weekly basis. Papers were restricted in length to between 500 and 600 words with the exception of the last portion of each paper, a series of illustrations of the topic. The topic provided to the students each week was a concept taken from the context of a "history and systems" of psychology. All the concepts were ideas or issues generally considerea within the scope of the history of psychology (e.g., introspection, hedonism, anthropomorphism, parallelism, etc.). The topics were randomly chosen from a pool of Uo such possible topics that are treated in beginning histories of psychology. No attempt was made to "equate" the topics in terms of 5</page><page sequence="4">SALT GLOVER and. SAUTTER whether the topics might evoke a greater or lesser number of illustrations. Previous research with these topics (Glover and Gary, 197*0» however, aid not demonstrate differences in creative responding by students among the UO topics available in this study. Students were instructed to briefly outline the historical antecedents of the concept, identify the individuals with which the concept was most closely associated, and to explain the concept in a way that would allow "an intelligent layperson to understand the concept from your writing". The last portion of each paper was to be devotea to illustrations of the particular concept involved. The instructions for this portion of the papers were "to list as many illustrations as you can think of for the concept". The grades assigned the students were based on criteria set forth by the instructor that omitted mention of the illustration section other than that described above. No directions were given concerning the sources to be consulten for the papers, but the texts and a series of library reserve materials that treated each concept were constantly available. Plagiarism, of course, resulted in an unacceptable paper. All the papers were collected at the end of the last period each week for 15 weeks by the instructor and given to the experimenter immediately after class for scoring. The illustration portions of each dis- cussion paper were scored by two independent raters. The raters scored the illustrations on the basis of four response measures, fluency, flexibility, elabora- tion and originality. These response measures were recorded in a logbook kept for that purpose during the 6</page><page sequence="5">SALT INCREASING CREATIVITY entire study. The assignment of papers was made by the in- structor on Mondays, the papers due the Thursday of that same week. The students had the entire interval of Monday morning until Thursday morning to complete their papers. No other time con- straints were involved. Al papers were returned the next day, Friday. Scoring time for the illustration section of the papers averaged one hour and ten minutes during the study. The instructor, by prior arrangement, did not read the illustration portion of any of the papers at any time during the semester. It was also agreed that he would not be informed of the student creativity scoring until the end òf the course when these points were added to the total number of points each student had attained on this portion of the course work. The papers describing the contingencies in effect and the forms containing each student's scores were also not examined by the instructor. During baseline, the students received small paper forms at the same time as their discussion papers were returned. These small forms merely stated that the illustrations were "good". During the four experimental conditions, the students received the same paper forms at the same time as they received their discussion papers. These forms then contained the scores the students had obtained on the response measure that could gain points and the number of points this score resulted in. These paper forms were always folded over and stapled to reduce the possibility of the instructor 7</page><page sequence="6">SALT GLOVER and SAUTTER inadvertantly seeing the score. Response Measures The illustration portions of the papers were scored on the four defined variables by the two raters, both graduate students in psychology, who were not informed about the purpose of the study nor the experimental conditions involved. Fluency (numbers of different responses). Fluency was the total of all different responses, i.e., if a student listed five illustrations, the student's fluency score would be five. Flexibility (numbers of different forms of responses). Flexibility was the total of all dif- ferent forms of responses, i.e., if five illustrations were in the same form (e.g., analogies) the flexibility score was one. If two responses were of one form (analogy), two others of another form (graphic rep- resentation), and two others of still another form (contrast), the flexibility score would be three. Analyses, analogies, syntheses, comparisons, contrast investigations of relationships, graphical repre- sentations and artistic representations comprised all the eight observed categories. Elaboration (number of words per response). Elaboration was defined as the mean number of words per response. Originality (statistice! in frequency of responses) Originality was defined here as the statistical in- frequency of responses as determined by how frequently an illustration occurred within all 31 of the papers. That is, an illustration that appeared on only one of 8</page><page sequence="7">SALT increasing creativity 31 papers on any topic was recorded, as an original response. To facilitate scoring, each day's total list of illustrations was reproduced on a wall unit blackboard by the experimenter. Reliability Reliability measures on the four variables were computed between scorers on each paper with the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Co- efficient. The £ for fluency was .91» «56 for flexibility, .96 for elaboration and .73 for originality. Experimental Conditions Baseline. On weeks 1, 2 and 3 (the first three papers), general procedures as described above were in effect. Enhancing Creativity. On the last day of the third week of class the students were informed that extra credit points toward their total grade for each paper could be attained if they were to in- crease their levels of creative responding within the illustration portion of their papers. The extra credit points would be added directly to their final total, even if the resulting scores were in excess of 100 percent of the possible number of points. The students were also in- formed that the instructor would not be aware of the number of points they had gained until the end of the course, nor the contingencies in effect at any time. It was explained to students that there are at least four components of creative responding, fluency, flexibility, elaboration and originality. Approximately 30 minutes was spent discussing the four components of creativity in 9</page><page sequence="8">g AI/p GLOVER and SAUTTER the absence of the instructor. This was the only discussion of the four components throughout the experiment. During the experimental conditions (week four to week fifteen), each student was awarded the extra points based on the conditions in effect. During the assignment of concept papers each time after this session, the experimenter distributed a sheet of paper to each class member containing the name of the response measure that could gain points along with the method of gaining points. Fluency. On weeks U to 6 (papers k, 5 and 6) one point was awarded for each different illustration. No points were given for illustrations that were repeated. Flexibility. On weeks 7 to 9 (papers 7» 8 ana 9) one extra créait point was awarded for each different form of illustration. No points were given for re- peated forms within the same list. Elaborat ion . On weeks 10, 11 and 12 (papers 10, 11 and 12) points were awarded at the rate of one- half point per word for the mean number of words per illustration to a maximum of ten points. Originality. On weeks 13, l1* and 15 (papers 13, 1^ and 15) two points were awarded for each illustration that did not appear within any of the other 30 papers. Those illustrations that appeared only twice within the total of 31 papers received one point. Illustrations appearing more than twice received no points. The Torrance Thinking Creatively With Words Test, Verbal form B (Torrance, 197^ ) » was administered by 10</page><page sequence="9">SALT INCREASING CREATIVITY the experimenter to all 31 students during a two- hour session following the first class meeting of the class in the absence of the instructor and re-administered in a similar two-hour session im- mediately after the last class meeting of the semester. Staraard directions were given with an arbitrary time limit of 10 minutes set for each subtest. All the tests were scored by the two raters employed throughout the study according to the directions provided by the handbook (Torrance, 197*0. Scoring reliability was checked for each student's test on the four response measures via Pearson Product Moment Correlations. The mean correlations were .77 for fluency, .63 for flexibil- ity, .95 for elaboration and .61 for originality. Results of the tests were made available to the students after the scoring of the second admin- istration of the test. The handbook directions for scoring the response measures are similar but not identical to those described for the experimental response measures within this study. The two hour test administration periods were scheduled by the administration of the school. Results and Discussion Figure 1 pictures the results. During the first experimental period, when fluency gained points, the mean number of responses increased over baseline. During the second experimental period, when flexibility earned points, that de- pendent measure increased. During the third ex- perimental period, when elaboration earned points, that measure increased greatly. During the final period, when originality gained points, there was a slight increase on this measure. These general results are representative of the results obtained for the individual students. 11</page><page sequence="10">SALT GLOVER anã SAUTTER I * •* HS IU Ik Ik o ins li Kl 11 • * ' * '' è D • * è D - S u I jí! s a ' it = ^ ' /ii.* ' ? f ï si ' ' ? / f ï ï si n ' -s si ii 1 n ' ' ' .. -s 1 !j g J * i » U É Ù g J * » É Ù - •» g . * ' » !

Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were also computed over the pre and post test results. A Z_ test for correlated samples demonstrated statistically significant differences for fluency, flexibility, and originality, but not for elaboration. The computed test-retest correlations for all four response measures were below those provided by Torrance (197*0 • These results are summarized in Table 1. Responses During baseline conditions, many of the re- sponses seemed obvious. For example, in re- sponding to anthropomorphism, the majority of responses stated "giving human characteristics to things not human". No forms of illustration other than description examples appeared. During the first experimental condition, the n timber of il- lustrations increased greatly but most of them were merely re-wordings of simple descriptions. For example, for responding to hedonism, the majority of responses were variants of "behavior governed by pleasure seeking". During the second condition, when points were awarded for flexibility, the number of forms of illustration increased. Analyses, analogies, syntheses, comparisons, contrast investigations of relationships and even graphical and artistic representations appeared (e.g., "Titchener's images are like the afterimage on a fading tele- vision screen"; "the relationships between the concept of images and that of sensations are nearly identical to those thought of by Hume, 150 years earlier where he. . . " ) . 13</page><page sequence="12">SALT GLOVER and SAUTTER CO 43 3 CO 4&gt; « ti eh H £ Ã V ■3 2 EH « 0) O -P CO 0 ßi 1 2 iL I fH H CI) P çvj 0O fJJ «H &gt;&gt; &lt;U Od GO t - CO t - -P EH *H • • • • I r-5 d 4&gt; II I II II -P «H t CO rO 3 u u u u 4&gt; cd g 4» 43 -H §W d .H 0) d 0) • 43 ^ ? 4&gt; 0) * ^ • CO 0) ? 43 ^ « Ł 43 .H 4) to &gt; , CO 4&gt; «H rû 43 43 ►* o J) g &lt;Ď 4&gt; &lt;Ď •rt - I U H CO 43 O ♦H 43 CO P CO 4) Vi 05 4) 43 O •H 43 « ® Í? rt 2 « S3 rt £ 43 CO LT' H ir' &gt; tí CO CO 00 (O 4 C'l «H Cd Cd 4) • 43 43 6 43 cd co g 4) II II II II 4) « ^ CO řj I u U U U o - 3 43 4) O 10 43 O &lt;łH 4) CO tí gH O CD 4) Pi U xi T* I ^ 43 41 4&gt; O , &gt; U EH , Vi Pi O 4) rP CO « 43 .tí P ä rļ tj O +*•*!! »H &gt;&gt; # O 43 ^ # Vi «ri O * # H Vi 43 IA VÛ W VO CO łH COOIAHLA 43 r^d 4) • • • • n w 4) EH t- VO H- t- 3 *H 43 CO H tí 1 11 11 11 11 2 2 2 ISJ tSj| CS3| CS3 1 tSl| 4) 43 43 U - H CO CO Pi O O) 4) 43 43 4) 43 O iH -P 'J V t*l 2 3 •H »H iH V 4) H 43 H i-ł «rt cd Cd Pi** ,û o &amp; U tí 4) (tf tí «H O -H # 43 •H 4&gt; X £ bO O U tí 4) Cd «H S cd H H H 5h &gt; Jx, w o lU</page><page sequence="13">SALT INCREASING CREATIVITY During condition three, when elaboration gained points, each illustration, in each paper was at least twenty words long. The unusualness of the illustrations decreased, however. During condition four, when originality gained points, some highly obscure illustrations appeared, such as "radical behaviorism may be seen to have similar relationships to early behaviorism as does radical liberal political thinking to that liberalism spawned in the New Deal...". The most common illustrations were very straightforward des- criptions in books, articles or lectures. After completion of the study, the classroom instructor and two colleagues were asked to read the illustrations the students had written and to subjectively evaluate them for "relevancy to topic". While there were some comments such as " "This one was really hairbrained" , their overall impression was that the majority of the illustra- tions were relevant to the topics and the course in generad and were not arbitrary listings of strange ideas. Furthermore, two independent raters, both high school psychology instructors and otherwise not connected with the study, were employed to provide some comparison between the experimental results and the subjective ratings of "relevancy". Their task was to read each of the 155 lists of illustrations and categorize them as relevant to the topic or irrelevant to the topic. Both raters were given the 155 lists but at different times. Verbal instructions stressed that they. were to rate each list independently with respect to the topic only. Reliability was 6k%, that is, out of the 155 lists, the raters agreed on 99 ratings. 15</page><page sequence="14">SALT GLOVER and SAUTTER A Chi square analysis shows this to he significantly above chance at the .01 level. On the 99 ratings that agreed, 8H were rated as "Relevant", 15 as "irrelevant" The 5 6 other lists were rated "relevant" by one rater and "irrelevant" by the other. Conclusions It is possible to modify the four operationally defined components of creativity within the framework of formal educational writing through the use of prescribed procedures. Whether the observed changes are unique to those procedures cannot be determined from the current study. It also appears that exposure to the procedures resulted in an increase in the students' scores on a standardized creativity test. The current study examined the effects of a training package including instructions, reinforcement and practice. This package seems to be a highly effective means of experimentally controlling behavior but the separate effects of instructions, reinforcement and practice cannot be determined from the current results . Implementing the treatment package is not partic- ularly difficult nor does it consume inordinate amounts of time. The raters in the study were able to rate all 31 lists in an average of one hour and ten minutes. As the instructor was already spending, by his approxi- mation, four to five hours per week grading the papers, this would amount to a 20 to 25 percent increase in total time committment. However, after the conclusion of this study several other instructors at the school were able to reduce this scoring time without lowering the effects to their satisfaction. The most facilitati? method seemed to be having the students exchange papers 1 6</page><page sequence="15">BALT INCREASING CREATIVITY and score each other's. This, for classes varying in size from 2 6 to 35, commonly took less than 10 minutes in class with the addition of about 20 min- utes preparation by the teacher spent listing the illustrations on the blackboard for the purposes of scoring originality. One instructor used her aide to ao the scoring but found that about one and one-half hours were almost always necessary. Additional research is necessary to determine whether practice alone, without the scoring, would result in increases in the four component scores. Intermittent scoring might also be in- vestigated as an alternative to investing the time necessary to score each list. It should be noted that the response measure of flexibility may have been inappropriate or in- complete within the context of the students 1 tasks . Only eight different forms of illustration appeared .throughout the study, as previously noted. The op- erationalized definition seems to be far more re- strictive than the earlier one used by Glover and Gary (1976) or what is implied by Torrance (197^ )• Attention should be given in the future to the problems posed by attempts to operationalize flex- ibility within the context of various tasks and for students at different levels . The relatively poor scoring reliability for flexibility ( . 56 ) may have been due in part to the difficulty of operationally defining this re- sponse measure. Categorizing responses as des- criptions , comparisons , contrasts , etc . , is evidentally more difficult then counting the number of responses, 17</page><page sequence="16">SALT GLOVER ana SAUTTER counting the number of words per response or deter- mining statistical infrequency . The nature of the task, listing illustrations, seems to limit students to one of eight possible categories of responses for flexibility. It may he that a more general approach, as espoused by Torrance, may lead to higher reliabilities where raters are asked to rate the number of different kinds of re- sponses, rather than attempting to categorize them. Re- search with flexibility in other forms of tasks, un- usual uses, asking questions, and making hypotheses, have yielded higher reliabilities from .7 6 to .91 (Glover, in press; Glover and Gary, 1977; Glover and Sautter, 1977) It was evident that the experimental package did control student responding. However, as contingencies changed, it was apparent that responding in one response mode was not maintained across treatments. For example, while fluency increased under the points contingent for fluency condition, it decreased over the next two conditions to the baseline level before increasing slightly in the originality condition. Of the four conditions originality seemed to have the most effect on all four variables , holding them all above baseline levels. For classroom adoption, it may prove most efficient to utilize only the originality conditions rather than all four. Maintenance may be improved by introducing a package containing contingent reinforcement for all four (or combinations of the four) response measures and intermittantly checking different response measures when scoring. In this way papers may be scored for originality on one occassion, flexibility on another and so on. The fact that the extra points were no longer available for fluency after that condition or flexibility after that condition, etc., would certainly seem to 18</page><page sequence="17">SALT INCREASING CREATIVI!'! indicate the need to provide some reinforcement for these responses on an intermi ttant schedule. In general, the results agree with the findings of Maltzman, Bogartz and Gregar (1958); Maltzman, Simon, Raskin, and Licht (i960); Reese and Parnés (1972); Goetz and Baer (1971 » 1973); Goetz and Salmonson (1972) ana Fallon and Goetz (1975). Maloney and Hopkins (1973) have demonstrated the effectiveness of increasing levels of creativity by providing reinforcement for creative writing during classroom activities among elementary school children. The findings of this study directly support their results as well as the findings of Glover and Gary (1976) wherein they demonstrated the efficacy of- enhancing four operationalized defined components of creativity in lists of unusual uses prepared by fourth and fifth grade students. Since operationalized equivalents of Torrance's four major components of creativity were success- fully enhanced with a corresponding increase in participants ' scores on a standardized measure of creativity, it seems that the prescribed pro- cedures can be successfully adapted for a wide variety of formal educational activities by classroom instructors as a means of enhancing creativity wherein the response measures of fluency, flexibility, elaboration and originality can be properly identified. 19</page><page sequence="18">SALT GLOVER and SAUTTER REFERENCES Barrish H.
