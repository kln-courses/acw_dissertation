(Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis and New York, 197I.) $6.95. 'The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. "Off with his head!" she said, without looking round' (Alice in Wonderland). Some philosophers and theologians seem to respond similarly to the mention of 'process theology'. They condemn it without understanding it. Brown, James and Reeves have now produced an anthology of basic studies which will make uninformed judgments less excusable in future. Most of its twenty-five pieces have previously been published either as articles or as parts of books. Among those published for the first time is a useful survey of the development of process theology and its ramifications. Other papers deal with the relation of philosophy and theology, the doctrine of God, Christology, and man, the world and the future. The collection illustrates the diversity and complexity of the theological implications and applications of Whiteheadian process thought. It thus provides a valuable introduction to this kind of theological thinking although the inclusion of one or two pieces is puzzling. I do not see, for instance, how an appreciation of process theology is advanced by the pieces by Browning and Diamond and the second one by Meland, interesting as they may be in their own right as they discuss faith and reason, linguistic philosophy and evolutionary ideas. The selection does not result in a hagiographical whitewashing of process theology. It is presented 'warts and all'. The pieces used reveal something of the internal debates within process theology, its relations to other theological positions and its need of further clarification and critical develop ment. There is included an essay by Sherburne which challenges the pro priety of using Whitehead's metaphysics as the foundation of process theology by suggesting how it may be possible to 'exorcise' the concept of God from Whitehead's system. One serious disadvantage of process theology illustrated by parts of this collection is its dependence on Whitehead's terminology. While novel insights may require new concepts, process theology would be less off-putting if it could find less obscure ways of expression. In the meantime, though, its critics must take care to understand its language before they can be justified in condemning its positions. Further, while the anthology is explicitly restricted to 'Whiteheadian' process philosophy, some of the contents reveal, so far as theology is concerned, important differences between Whitehead's own position and that of Charles Hartshorne. Cobb and Ely, for instance, consider that a doctrine of God cannot be satisfactorily derived from Whitehead's own statement without important modifications. While, then, Whitehead is its inspiration, Hartshorne, for all his acknow ledged indebtedness to Whitehead, may properly be regarded as the founder D</page><page sequence="2">98 REVIEWS of process theology and his thought treated independently. Since, therefore, this collection is primarily concerned with the relation of process thought to theology, it might have benefited from paying more attention to Hartshorne's theism and having less about Whitehead. The piece by Hartshorne illustrates the logical rigour which marks his work (in contrast to some popular discussions of process theology by others) and his unfashionable search for a priori reasoning to support his theistic conclusions. It also provides examples of the careful distinctions which he uses in developing his concept of God as 'the perfectly loving individual' so as to avoid both inadequate and mutually inconsistent notions. This collection also illustrates in practice the basic difference between the process theology which uses the conceptual insights of process thought and the process theology which is also essentially committed to the truth of process meta physics. There clearly are problems in divorcing the concepts belonging to a system from that system. Nevertheless, not all process theology is condemned if process metaphysics is condemned. While, for example, we may reject panpsychism as a true description of reality, we may still accept that it can provide us with a useful model for exploring and expressing the relation of God to the world. Schubert Ogden writes that 'no religious tradition can long continue as a vital source of faith and life unless it is critically appropriated in each new historical situation' (p. I73). Process theologians hold that their position provides a way by which truly contemporary secular men can also believe in God. They claim, for instance, as Stokes puts it, that 'the Whiteheadian approach' meets 'the contemporary problem of God' by affirming 'a living God of the future rather than an anthropomorphic God of frozen history', a God whose transcendence denieg neither his concrete activity within the world nor 'man's free creative role' (p. 263). These are large claims. The question is: Are they justified? In spite of its initial strangeness and in spite of particular points of disagreement-a short review like this is no place for the detailed examination of a wide-ranging collection of essays-it is perhaps worth-while attempting to understand why process theologians make such claims and what is the theological position they make such claims for. This volume is a good place to begin such an attempt. It finishes with a bibliography which seeks to list all 'significant works on Whiteheadian process theology'. This is most valuable-even though it mis-spells my name! DAVID A. PAILIN</page></plain_text>
