One important fact which has emerged clearly from the discovery of the St. Mark's Isaiah Scroll —- hereafter designated SM — is that all too few biblical scholars have been trained in the past few decades to deal with the problems of textual criti cism. Having been assured at the outset that the Scroll was both pre-Christian in date and of revolutionary importance in content — as though there were necessarily any real connection between the chronology of a manuscript and the value of its text' — students of the Hebrew Bible overnight became textual critics, and rushed into print with "authoritative" articles on the relative merits of the variant readings in SM as against those preserved in the masoretic text (hereafter designated MT). I say "overnight" because a significant proportion of the authors in question lacked the experience and ability to analyze the Hebrew text and the ancient translations made * Studies I-V appeared respectively in JBL, 69 (1950), 149-166 (where I discussed MTntoirsM 33.6חושב; MT 5?'T,SM 42.13 יודיע; MT והיה SM היה 43.10; MT נתיבות SM 43.19 נהרות [on which see also BASOR, 123, Oct. 1951, 33-351): JNES, II (1952), 153-6 (MT צוחו) SM 42.11 יצריחו); Journal of Jewish Jewish Studies, 2 (1951), 151-4 (MT חמה אפי SM 43.25 חמת אפוא); JQR, 43 (195234°~329 &lt;(53־ (see n• 5 below for the passages concerned); Israel Exploration Exploration Journal, 4 (1954), 5-8 (see n. 6 below). "Studies VII" (MT בנ!ןי SM 49.17 בוניך) will appear in Tarbiz, 1954. 1Cf. my remarks in JBL, 69 (1950), 150 f., on "a fourteenth century manuscript containing the text of an Arabic translation made around the eighth century from the Greek (which) 'is infinitely superior in the text it represents' to a handsome Greek uncial of the fifth century."</page><page sequence="2">86 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [2] directly from it, and they had never, or virtually never, written anything in this discipline previously. But when the Isaiah Scroll came along, with its boundless "wealth" of variants, these authors simply picked dozens of these ready-made variants which appeared superior to the readings in MT, and pro nounced them as superior by fiat. Hardly ever was any attempt made to prove the variant in SM superior to MT ; so that those of us, alas all too few in number, who were not blinded by the superficial dazzle of these variants, found ourselves over whelmed by the sheer quantity of SM variants thrown at us in nearly every issue of every journal devoted to biblical studies, indeed even in publications ordinarily devoted to modern poli tics, finance, and news of human interest. It required little ability and courage, and even less time, to pick a variant in SM and solemnly pronounce it original. On the other hand, it takes days and weeks of drudgery to study all the data pertinent to the problem, to refute methodologically the alleged superiority so glibly pronounced for the SM variant. 2. There is, unfortunately, a second source of ready misin formation for the unwary, namely, the so-called critical apparatus in the Biblia Hebraica edited by Rudolf Kittel. The better critic has long been careful not to accept anything in this edition at its face value without going to the sources directly. There is scarcely a line in this apparatus which does not swarm with serious errors of commission and omission, and this is true especially of those books, such as the Book of Isaiah, which Kittel himself edited. Kittel never mastered the discipline of lower textual criticism, and he himself only very rarely indeed studied the all-important ancient primary versions at their source; he was essentially but a compiler who exercised no direct control over the data which he compiled.3 The consequences for the lower textual criticism of the 3See my "Studies IV" (JQR, 43 [1952-53], 329-40), passim, and my discussion of "The Use of the Versions in Translating the Holy Scriptures" (part of a Symposium on the Revised Standard Version of the Hebrew Bible), Religious Religious Education, 47 (July-August, 1952), §D on pp. 256-8 and nn. 11-15.

Not only have biblical schol ars in general lost all direct contact with the sources, but they have been contenting themselves with utilizing instead Kittel's apparatus, which itself, as we have noted, was too far removed from the sources to be of any positive value to the scholar; it could but mislead. 3. In the course of a long review-article on the Scrolls,3 Walter Baumgartner of Basel devoted two pages (114-6) to the text of the Isaiah Scroll, in which he admitted that some of the variants in SM which had been accorded priority and superiority to those in MT in the first flush of discovery, had been demon strated by me to be but corruptions. However, continued Baum gartner, there remained a number of other variants in SM which appeared definitely to be superior to MT, and he listed ten such variants,4 referring usually to Kittel's BH for support. With the first three5 of these ten variants I have dealt in "Studies IV" (JQR, 43 [1952], 329-340), and with the fourth variant6 in "Studies V" (Israel Exploration Journal, 4 [1954], 5-8). Here I propose to subject Baumgartner's fifth and sixth variants to the kind of textual analysis which I believe they deserve. נ "Der palastinische Handschriftenfund," Zweiter Bericht, in Theologische Rundschau,Rundschau, 19 (1951), 97-154. 4 "Dass der Text der Rolle im grossen und ganzen schlechter 1st als der MT, ist allgemeines Urteil. Aber es gibt schon genug Varianten, die ernstlich beachtet sein vollen . . .

Aber selbst wenn er in jenen Fallen [viz., Studies I] recht hâtte, will Orlinsky das auch heute angesichts des ganzen Textes behaupten? Ich nenne von Varianten bloss . . ." (pp. 114-5). When Baumgartner wrote this, only my "Studies I" had appeared. Baumgartner's list of ten variants is much more select than that compiled by G. R. Driver, in JTS, New Series, 2 (1951), 25-6. Driver's long list of variants in SM which are alleged to confirm "emendations which have been proposed by various scholars" may quite safely be ignored by the discrim inating scholar. 5 MT כל; SM 7.1 יכלו; MT מז־ה^ה SM 14.4 מרהבה; MT nr!;SM אהרוג 14-30• 6 MT דימון SM !15.9 ריבו (bis).</page><page sequence="4">HARRY Μ.

The author of the impassioned denunciation of Edom in chaps. 34-35 addresses himself to those who will witness God's devastation of Edom (34.16): "Seek out the book of the Lord, and read, Not one of these shall be missing, None shall be lacking her mate. For My mouth has commanded it, And its breath has gathered them." The last two clauses in MT read: כי־פי הוא צוה ורוחו הוא קכצן 5. Most scholars have felt the construction פי הוא in the context to be so difficult as to demand an emendation. Some changed פי הוא into פיו or פיהו "His mouth" (// רוחו "His breath"), and the others, e. g., Duhm ("entweder mit mehreren Exegeten פיהו oder besser mit LXX פי יהוה zu lesen"), Marti, Ehrlich ("hochst wahrscheinlich יהוה"), Kittel (BH3), Ziegler (Isaias, 1948, p. 104), read 7.כי פי יהוה צוה The former emendation is purely conjectural; the latter is based upon LXX ότι κύριος ΐν6τ6ίλατο aureus and on the reading כי פי יהוה (הוא) צוה preserved in 5 Kennicott manuscripts.8 6. For MT כי פי הוא צוה, SM reads כיא פיהו הוא צוה קבצ . . .) [sic!] ורוחהו היאה). On SM's פיהו הוא, which he re gards as superior to MT, Baumgartner notes merely: "s. Β. H." Kittel's BH3, however, reads: כי־פ" הוא צוה, with the note: "cins c 5 MSS יהוה (cf G Afrabica])," and consequently has no bearing at all on SM's reading. 7 Among those who emend MT, usually to כי פי יהוה (הוא) דבר, may be mentioned, in addition, Robert Lowth (1834), C. J. Bredenkamp (1887), F. Feldmann (1925), O. Procksch (1930), E. J. Kissane (1941), B. J. Roberts, The The Old Testament Text and Versions (Cardiff, 1951, p. 127). 8 Kennicott's apparattis criticus reads: 1,30,206,337 פי יהוה — פי הוא» 576; nunc 531 — פי ;602 ,584 ,160 פיהו primo 96 פה — a 560 — 607 היא.

As for the preserved Hebrew reading, the textual situation is in need of some clarification, (a) While scholars have been ready to insert יהוה because of LXX KVpcos, they have not troubled to determine from a closer study of the character of the LXX of Isaiah whether the translator added /cupios on his own, and whether ότι /ci/pios ένβτΰλατο does not really derive from a Vorlage כי יהוה צוה, rather than reflect a free rendering of original כי פי יהוה (הוא) צוה. (i) My own detailed analysis of "The Treatment of Anthro pomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the LXX of Isaiah" (§8)9 leads me to believe that for any anthropomorphic reason alone, the LXX translator would not have failed to reproduce פי in association with the Lord. On the other hand, the LXX did paraphrase פי יהוה sometimes; cf. e. g., on /cuptos έλάλησβ/ 40.5) בי פי יהוה דבר; contrast τό yap στόμα κυρίου ΐλάλησβν ταύτα ταύτα in 1.20 and 58-14)1 יפי לא ^יאליי / tpe όβ ουκ ίπηρώτησ αν (30.2; cf. JPS "and have not asked at [!] My mouth," and Revised Standard Version "without asking for my counsel"). If I am inclined to believe that the LXX paraphrased a Vorlage כי פי יהוה (הוא) צוה, it is because פי is not lacking in any text tradition, (ii) It is probable that LXX xuptos reflects the reading יהוה in its Hebrew Vorlage. This is so in part because the translator of Isaiah was not wont to introduce /cuptos without the Hebrew equivalent, and chiefly because several Hebrew manuscripts read יהוה (cf. above §5 and n. 8). 8. (b) Between MT כי פי הוא צוה and the Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX כי פי יהוה (הוא) צוה, there can be little doubt that the latter is original: (i) While it is conceivable that the yod in פי was taken by the translator as the abbreviation of יהוה, as he did once elsewhere in the Book (2.11),10 this is ruled out by the reading יהוה in some Hebrew manuscripts; the combination 9 To appear in the Annual of the Israel Exploration Society, Eretz-Israel, Vol. III. 10 (...

ORUNSKY [6] of the LXX and the Hebrew manuscripts is conclusive here, (ii) The Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX makes for a considerably more natural syntax and parallelism (כי פי יהוה הוא צוה // ורוחו הוא קבצן) than the preserved reading; per se the argument of a better reading than MT should not carry too much weight, but it is decisive when associated with the argument of the LXX and Hebrew manuscripts. The construction of our restored text is identical with that of ןךאת יהוה היא אוצרו in 33-6, וחמתי היא סמכוזני in 63.5, and similarly elsewhere in our Book." 9· The reading in SM (כיא פיהו הוא צוה) is not only post-LXX (when יהוה was still extant) but is itself a corruption of the text-tradition from which MT derives: (i) It is clear that an original reading כי פי יהוה הוא צוה ( = LXX; Heb. Mss.) could readily become כי פי הוא צוה ( = MT) by the accidental loss of יהוה in the context; SM, in turn, is a further, rather simple corruption of MT by dittography of (פי הו(א צוה, to become פיהו הוא. This is precisely the kind of corruption which occurred in Kenn. 160, 584, 602, and de Rossi 715, primo 20, 663. (ii) Whatever data are available make it clear that it would have been the form פיו rather than פיהו (SM) which would have been employed by the author of Isaiah: (a) On all 5 occasions in our Book (11.4; 29.13; 53.7 [5fs] 9) it is ב)פיו) and not ב)פיהו) which is employed; (β) A reading כי פיו הוא צוה would have prevented the ensuing corruptions. In fine, far from preserving an original reading of the Hebrew text of Isaiah at this point, SM actually is only a secondary corruption of the text-tradition which finally became masoretic. 10. In the very dramatic exhortation to the Judean exiles to believe in their God's uniqueness and omnipotence, and in their own imminent deliverance at His hands from the exile, Deutero-Isaiah says (40.12), 11 11 This use of היא / היא in Deutero-Isaiah is common enough; cf. 43.25; 51.9, 10, 12; 52.6.</page><page sequence="7">[7] STUDIES IN ST.

In the early days of the discovery of the St. Mark's Isaiah Scroll, it was natural for some scholars to look eagerly for important, and even original variants in SM, so that the latter's reading (. . . מיא מדד בשועלו) מי ים (ושמים בזרתו תכן) "the waters of the sea" was preferred by some to MT מים. Baumgartner reflects this preference ("mj jm, 'Wasser des Meeres' . . . von Sukenik und Seeligmann vorgezogen"), even though no one had ever really studied the variant in SM properly before choosing it as original. 11. A careful analysis of MT מים and SM מי ,ים in the context makes it amply clear that מי ים is only an erroneous reading, brought into being by a misreading or mishearing of מים as מי ,ים, perhaps via ס,ים; cf. Burrows, BASOR, 113 (Feb. 1949), 27 (in § Slips of Memory), "מי ים / מים (several explanations of this change are equally possible)."113 (a) It has long been recognized that the combination מןם 00מ.י was deliberate on the part of the author; cf., e. g., Torrey (The(The(The Second Isaiah, p. 307), "Observe how mayim and shamayim are put side by side for the sake of the sound, after the usual manner of this writer." It may well be that !מןם ואו in 41.17 con־ stitutes a similar assonance. (b) All the versions, without any exception, preserve the reading of the masoretic text-tradition." (c) Those who have shown a preference for the reading in SM, or have even regarded it seriously, failed to realize that the m It is interesting to note here that in 24.14 D'O, usually rendered "from the sea (or, west)," was interpreted as though מי ים in the LXX (τό ΰδορ της της θαλάσσης)θαλάσσης) and Theodotion (ύδατα θαλασσής). "" Β. J. Roberts, loc. cit., erroneously cites the LXX as support for ,Π; it is only SM which reads thus. Neither Kenn. nor de Rossi cites any variant Hebrew readings. Kittel, BH3, tells his readers bluntly, "1 פיס]," a wholly gratuitous proposition.</page><page sequence="8">92 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [8] expression □מי י is hardly good Hebrew.

In other words, only one who was desperately seeking a worthwhile variant in SM would have passed so easily over MT מים, the normal and natural term for one of the three primary natural phenomena, viz., water, heaven and earth, in favor of the obviously corrupt reading in SM.13 13 One is reminded of the unseemly haste with which, e. g., SM 32.6 חושב and 43.10 היה were found acceptable by some scholars in place of MT יעשה and היה: (see nn.* and 4 above), preferences which no longer obtain.</page></plain_text>
