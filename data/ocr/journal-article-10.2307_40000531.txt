<plain_text><page sequence="1">Egyptian Art in Jordan1 Alicia Meza Most of the Ancient Egyptian art remains in Jordan come from sites near the King's Highway (fig. 1). A patterned line results from tracing these sites of varied dating. Obviously, the ob- jects recovered are Egyptianized, but some are Egyptian made. The purpose of this essay is to analyze the reasons behind this archaeological pattern and try to place the objects within the chronology of Ancient Egypt.2 The sites of Egyptianized remains are inter- spersed along a line that runs north-south from the border with Syria to the Gulf of Aqaba. A variation of this pattern is near the crossing to the West Bank, where finds are traced to Jericho. Probably, these remains belonged to ancient towns connected over the Jordan River. Another cluster of sites is located northwest of Amman, around the Jordan Valley, near the border with Syria and Lake Tiberias. This site cluster pre- sents evidence of Ancient Jordanian contacts with Lebanon and the important coastal cities. In the southern area the main post is the city of Petra, the ancient trade center for the caravan route between Egypt and the spice lands (Zaya- dine, 1990:37; 1985:163).3 Indeed the first attested Egyptian presence in the Sinai and the Negev desert dates from Pre- dynastic times. Egyptian predynastic pottery was uncovered at Tel Erani, west of Lachish, and Egyptian predynastic pottery and artifacts were found at Arad. In addition, some inscriptions bearing the name of Narmer were discovered at 'En Bessor, Israel (Mazar, 1992:106-7). It is significant that all these sites are located east of the Jordan River near the city of Kerak, an im- portant town in Transjordan. It seems important sites were connected over the Jordan River. An Old Kingdom scene from the pyramid temple of King Sahure, 5th Dynasty, depicts Asi- atics coming to Egypt by ship. The text reads: "Hail to thee, O Sahure, god of the living! May we behold thy beauty!" However, as this scene depicts peaceful, friendly, perhaps trading, rela- tionships between Syro-Palestine and Egypt, this was not always the case. Punitive campaigns were also recorded, such as in the biography of Weny, who served under Pepy I, 6th Dynasty. The "Way of Horus," also called "the way of the northern fort in the district of Horus lord of truth," led the king's army into Palestine.4 Besides the story of Sinuhe, another important source of infor- mation about the relationship between Egypt and Palestine is the Execration Texts from the Middle Kingdom (Redford, 1992:87). 5 A list of toponyms, the nomads living in Palestine and their chiefs' names has been extracted from this source of data. Moreover, additional informa- tion was inferred about the social organization 1 My thanks to Dr. Fawzi Zayadine, who provided me with valuable suggestions, bringing to my attention many of the objects here described. He also made available the photo- graphs used in this article. 2 The artifacts analyzed here are only a small group com- pared to the actual remains unearthed in Jordan. This ancient route was intensively traveled by prehistoric traders from Egypt and Mesopotamia (Meza, 1996). Archae- ological evidence suggests that Egyptian Predynastic kings marched along this path in their campaigns to Syro-Pales- tine. (Redford, 1992, 18-38; 54-55; Schulman, 1991, 87-88). The continuation of the way of Horus is no other than the present King's Highway of Jordan. Another road to Leb- anon, following the Mediterranean coast, was mentioned in the narration of Sinuhe . . . "land gave me to land, and I set out to Byblos" (Redford, 1992, 86). 5 The importance of these texts is that they mention some of the local chiefs of Palestine and the places from where they ruled. For instance, the Mirgissa Texts c. 1870 B.C. name a Yantin-Hadad, who at this time was ruling Haram, near Jericho (Kitchen, 1992, 23). 199</page><page sequence="2">200 JARCE XXXVII (2000) Fig. 1.

It presents an Egyptian style. of the nomads of Transjordan, who were mostly transhumant groups.6 Continuous Egyptian incursions into Transjor- dan left behind a rich heritage of art and reli- gious concepts. These ideas were, subsequently, blended with the indigenous Jordanian art. For instance, a zoomorphic jug in the Jordan Mu- seum (J 3933) dates from about Middle King- dom times. It comes from Jericho and presents an evident Egyptianized style (fig. 2). The jug is wheel made of fired clay and has the shape of a duck; it measures 22 x 20.5 cm. The duck form was commonly used in Egyptian minor arts, such as in the shape of cosmetic spoons and vases. The Jericho vase has a snake carved on its body. Fig. 3. Vase for liquids and grain, with ram carved along its height. Probably alluding to the god Amun. Considering that it comes from a tomb, this snake may have had religious and protective meaning. In the same case, there is another vase of identi- cal material commonly used for keeping liquids or grain. It has a ram carved along its height, from the bottom of the base to the rim, which ends in the shape of the animal's nose. The ram's horns terminate in two little handles. Ob- viously the vase's carving represents the sun god Amun (fig. 3). Perhaps the owner of this jug was an important person, if not a ruler, of the place where the tomb was located. It is obvious that the manufacture of both artifacts is from a local workshop. However, both objects have Egyptian features with significant religious meaning. A splendid ivory inlaid box (J 15530) exhib- ited in the Jordan Museum, dates from Late Bronze Age or about 1300-1200 B.C.8 Within Egyptian chronology this dating corresponds to 6 Transhumance, or seasonal movement of livestock be- tween upland and lowland pastures, is a form of nomadism found throughout the mountainous zones of the Middle East. Transhuman nomads often camp together for extended periods of time in two major grazing areas: summer pastures in the mountains and winter pasture in the valley (Bates; Plog, 1991:89). Obviously this duck was designed after the hieroglyph sd used in the insignia of the Egyptian king. 8 Although the ivory box is dated late Bronze Age, it has been described as Middle Bronze Age, perhaps a gift from king Amenemhat IV to a Canaanite prince in Byblos (P. Amiet, Pella, 1988, 93). However I am more inclined to date it as an 18th Dynasty artwork.</page><page sequence="4">202 JARCE XXXVII (2000) Fig. 4. Ivory inlaid box (J 15530) decorated with djed pil- lars and feline figures. the end of the 18th Dynasty or the beginning of the 19th Dynasty. The box comes from Pella, north of Amman, and its style and decoration are typically Egyptian (fig. 4). It measures 13.6 x 15.6 cm and resembles the cosmetic boxes found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. It is made of black painted wood, has a frieze around in- laid in ivory, and is divided into panels. The dec- oration of some of the panels presents a djed pillar, the backbone, symbol of Osiris. Another decoration in the panels represent a bundle of papyrus, the symbol for Lower Egypt. On the top, inlaid in ivory, two feline figures confront each other, standing at the sides of two uraei which have their long tails entwined. The two feline figures have a clear Mesopotamian style, similar to the felines engraved in the prehistoric Egyptian slate palettes, representing the king. The side of the top of the box has an inlaid winged solar disk. A coiling cobra, also in ivory, is the clutch to close the box. A Moabite stela in basalt comes from Shihan and is now in the Louvre Museum (Louvre, AO 5055). It has engraved a warrior wearing a short kilt and a wig. Both features resemble the 18th Dynasty style (fig. 5). However, the stela Fig 5. Moabite stela from Shihan (Louvre, AO 5055) with engraved warrior wearing Egyptian style kilt and wig. has been dated as of 9th-10th century B.C., or Late Bronze Age and represents the Canaanite god Baal, the god of thunder, from Ugarit. The warrior has a lance in his hand, symbolizing lightning. Behind him there is a standing animal, symbolizing perhaps a stolen bird. It is 103 cm high, 58 cm broad. Although the site of its dis- covery was near the Dead Sea, it may have come from another place. In the same area, at Baluca, near Dhiban and north of Kerak another stela was found and is now in the Jordan Museum (fig. 6) . The Baluca stela has three personages incised in a raised relief in the lower part. An inscription was origi- nally carved in the upper panel, now completely erased. This stela has been dated as belonging to the 12th- 13th century B.C. This dating would</page><page sequence="5">EGYPTIAN ART IN JORDAN 203 Fig. 6. Baluca stela showing three personages: a king, a god and a goddess, in a typical Egyptian style representation. place the work during the time of the 19th- 20th Dynasties of Egypt. The god facing the king has a wds scepter in his left hand, the symbol of power. In his right hand, he has some uniden- tified object which he is handling to the king. The goddess wears a sheath dress with a trail- ing sash and an Osirian crown.9 She also has an ankh in her right hand. Near the shoulder of the king there is a crescent, perhaps the symbol of Fig 7. Anthropoid sarcophagus in the Jordan Museum (J 2802). It has four loop handles: two are its ears, one is its beard and the other is at the top of its head. the goddess. In front of his face there is an orb and a crescent perhaps associated with the god (Ward and Martin, 1964:16). 10 An anthropoid sarcophagus in the Jordan Museum (J 2802) comes from a tomb in Sahab, south of Amman, and it is dated as of the 10th century B.C. (fig. 7). The sarcophagus has four loop handles two of which represent its ears, one is on the tip of its beard and the other at the top of its head. Its height is 44 cm. The Egyp- tianized style of this sarcophagus is the same as group A of the anthropomorphic sarcophagi 9 This type of sash had a religious connotation during the 18th and 19th Dynasties. It was worn by goddesses and by the Chief Royal wife, who was responsible for transmitting the divine royal line. Ward and Martin (1964, 26 endnote 57) mention the instance when goddesses such as Anat, Astarte, the Egyptian goddess Satis, and a Canaanite goddess were depicted wearing this type of crown and dress during the reign of Ramses II. 10 According to Ward and Martin (1964, 5-27) the stela may have been carved at the time of Seti I or Ramses II. The images on the relief are described as being a god, a king, and a goddess - the king representing the monarch of the Shushu nomads and the goddess as perhaps Hathor. The in- scription appears to be hieroglyphic. However, the signs are clumsy and some of them are barely recognizable, indicating that this was the work of a non-Egyptian artist. The authors tentatively translate part of the inscription as "the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Thutmosis IV" This name does not agree with the dating given by them since this king belongs to the 18th Dynasty. Nevertheless they conclude that the name is not clearly written and it may be different.</page><page sequence="6">204 JARCE XXXVII (2000) Fig. 8. Baboon carrying a lamb on his shoulders (J 1832). from Deir el-Balah, a site south of Israel. How- ever, this Egyptianized style originated during the Amarna period of the 18th Dynasty, when Egypt had a military post at Deir el Balah.11 A terracotta figurine in the Jordan Museum (J 1832) represents a baboon carrying a lamb Fig. 9. Terracotta model of a shrine (J 5751). At its entrance there are two nude girls holding tambourines in their hands. on his shoulders; its height is 12 cm (fig. 8). Probably its eyes were originally inlaid. This figurine has been dated as Iron Age, 10-1 lth century B.C., which corresponds to the time of the 20th-21st Dynasty of Egypt. The baboon was sacred to the Egyptian moon god Thoth, who also was the god of wisdom and writing,12 and thus the baboon symbolized those features. A terracotta model of a shrine, today in the Jordan Museum (J 5751), was purchased by the Museum in Kerak (fig. 9). It has been dated to the 10th- 11th century B.C. and its height is 15 cm. At the entrance of the shrine, there are two nude girls, who hold tambourines in their hands. Their arms are crossed over their chests. Both girls have a necklace with a pendant that falls in between their breasts. It has been suggested that the girls may have represented hierodules of the cult of Astarte, but they could also have a con- nection to the Egyptian Hathor. Since she was 11 These sarcophagi have the arms and head carved in relief and their big, closed eyes show typical Canaanite fea- tures. At the beginning of the Egyptian occupation, these sarcophagi may have been crafted by Egyptians living in Deir el Balah. Later the sarcophagi became much distorted in shape and style, when they began being manufactured by non-Egyptian craftsmen. They were used only for burials of high ranking officials, such as military commanders and the town mayors. Baboons symbolized the adoration of the rising sun in the morning. In the Abu Simbel temple of Ramses II, the statues of four baboons greeted the first rays of the sun, which in the early morning illuminate the temple's en- trance. Baboons are known for emitting sounds at dawn as if greeting the light of the new day.</page><page sequence="7">EGYPTIAN ART IN JORDAN 205 the goddess of love and music, Hathor was usu- ally depicted playing sistra, her symbolic instru- ment. There are many instances in which unclad Egyptian girls are depicted making merriment with either tambourines or sistra to pay homage to Hathor. A standing figure made of grey granite was unearthed in the Citadel in Amman. Its height is 83 cm. and dates from the 8th century B.C. (fig. 10). 13 Today this statuette is in the Jordan Museum (J 1657) along with three other similar figures found in the same site. The standing male figure wears an Osirian "atef " crown and a dress similar to that worn by personages from Syria and Phoenicia. His stance is rigid and for- mal, his feet are bare and placed together. The right arm is extended next to the body and his fist is closed as in a pharaonic position. The left arm is crossed over the chest, with the fist closed as if he was holding a torch or other object, per- haps in a position of presenting an offering. His crown may indicate that he was a deceased king, since the Osirian crown was depicted on the heads of Egyptian kings after death. This status of a Moabite king may have been placed in a temple as a votive statue to a local god after the king's death. The second statue of a standing male (fig. 11) also comes from the Citadel in Amman and is also in the Jordan Museum (J 1656). Its height is 48 cm. The statue is dated as 8th century B.C. It is made of limestone with a trace of a red slip and has a two-line inscription, which reads: "Statue of Yerah Azar son of Zakir, son of Sanipu." The figure stands on a square pedestal and has a formal pose, like the other statue, except that its left foot is advanced. It holds a lotus flower in the left hand, which is across the chest.14 The Fig. 10. A standing figurine of a male wearing an Osirian crown (J 1657). It is made of grey granite. 13 The dating of the statue corresponds to the Third Intermediate Period, at the end of the 23rd-24th Libyan Dynasties, or perhaps at the beginning of the 25th Kushite Dynasty. The kings of the Libyan Dynasties were in close contact with the kings and chiefs of Palestine, since they were ruling from the Egyptian Delta. Such was Shoshenk I, the biblical Shishak. 4 The lotus flower, symbol of the sun was associated with the goddess Hathor, wife of the sun god Re, and equated with the word ankh, life. Therefore, many 18th Dynasty ob- jects fused the name of the king with the lotus flower in the form of an ankh. The lotus also had a sexual connotation, since its pollen was considered an aphrodisiac and mixed in drinks (Wilkinson, 1994, 161; 182).</page><page sequence="8">206 JARCE XXXVII (2000) Fig. 11. Standing male figure (J 1656) with inscription: "Statue of Yerah Azar son of Zakir, son of Sanipu. " right arm is extended next to the body and the fist is clenched in Egyptian style. The eyes were originally inlaid, and the chin is covered with a beard. Two long curls fall on the sides of the face and before the ears in the Syrian style later Fig. 12. Bearded head with an Osirian crown (f 4767). adopted by the Hebrews. The rest of the hair falls on the back. The figure wears a Syrian cap and a draped tunic with a sash or shawl, which ends in a tassel over the right shoulder on the front. Obviously this statue was an image of a king immortalized in Egyptian or Syrian style, since the other non-Egyptian attributes are from Mesopotamia or Phoenicia. The bearded head with an Osirian crown, also in the Jordan Museum (J 4767), is made of yel- low limestone with traces of red ocher (fig. 12) and measures 25 cm. Although the crown style is of Egyptian origin, its face and top have a Phoenician adaptation. This head was found in the Amman Citadel and is dated 8th century B.C. It may represent a prince or king from Rab- bath-Ammon. The Egyptian concepts of afterlife and resurrection, expressed in representation of the Osirian elements, were passed on to the di- verse cultural societies living in Syro-Palestine. Two other statues of yellow limestone, coming from Khirbet el-Hajjar, are also in the Jordan Museum. They both show traces of red ocher paint and both date from the 8th-7th century B.C.</page><page sequence="9">EGYPTIAN ART IN JORDAN 207 The male (J 12953) is of a more clumsy crafts- manship than the other two statues described above. It measures 51 cm. This figure has no neck delineated and the ears are disproportionately large for the rest of the features. It was perhaps made by a local sculptor in imitation of the Yerah Azar statue. It wears a type of atef crown which also has mixed foreign features, may be Syrian or Phoenician.15 His dress is a tunic falling to the bare feet. The female statue (J 12954), 47 cm height, also wears a tunic and a smock, under- neath which are the two ends of a belt (fig. 13). Her hair falls on her back below her ears, which recalls the Egyptian wigs. She has ornate earrings and her broken arms are drawn to her chest. Per- haps she was holding an object now obliterated. This pair of statues may have been a depiction of a royal couple contemplating immortality, Egyp- tian style, since both have a solemn pose. A double-faced female head, from the Amman Citadel, is also part of the group of sculptured stone artifacts in the Jordan Museum (J 11689). Its height is 30 cm. It is made of soft limestone and the face has ivory inlaid eyes, which are com- pletely delineated by a cosmetic line, Egyptian style (fig. 14). The face on the reverse has in- scribed the Ammonite letters "b" and "s." On the eye of the reverse there is also engraved the Egyp- tian sign nfr, "beautiful," encircled by a uraeus. The hair style imitates the hair in Egyptian wigs, pulled behind the ears and falling on the sides of the face. The face was part of a group of three similar heads, which resemble the Hathor heads used as columns' capitals in the Egyptian tem- ples. This head has been dated as of 7th century B.C.16 In Egyptian chronology this date corre- sponds to the 25th Dynasty, Late Period.17 It is possible that the inscription of the sign nfr on the Hathor head may have been part of the car- touche of the Egyptian king who was upon the throne at this time. Fig. 13. Female statue of a pair wearing a wig in Egyptian style {f 12954). A male statue of yellow limestone with red paint comes from Irja and is now in the Jordan Museum (J 11260). The statue is 44 cm height 15 Perhaps a hint to the Egyptian double crown, different from the Osirian crown, which is composed of the white crown of Upper Egypt, the tall plumes and the horns. 15 There were four faces, which were probably parts of windows on a balcony. They may have been visible from the inside and the outside of the walls. They are compared with the double-faced capital heads of Hathor in Cyprus and the balcony heads of Nimrud in Iraq. 17 During this Dynasty the kingdom of Egypt was split in two political halves. The northern part was under the rule of the 25th Dynasty, at the end of the Third Intermediate Period. The south of Egypt was under the Nubian 25th Dynasty which falls within the Late Period. The first king of this Dynasty was Shabaka, his prenomen was Neferkare or "the ka of Re is beautiful."</page><page sequence="10">208 JARCE XXXVII (2000) Fig. 14.

(fig. 15) and is standing with the left foot ad- vanced and arms extended next to his body. The right fist is closed in Egyptian style, holding a piece of cloth, here invisible. The hair and face suggest an African origin. He wears a loincloth which uncovers the left leg. He also wears globu- lar earrings. Since this statue may date from the 7th century B.C., the African features of the male may refer to the Nubian Egyptian kings of this period, such as Shabaqa. The archaic style of the statue may also point to this same king, who appealed to the archaic works of the Old Kingdom. A head of white marble coming from Umm Qeis, in the Jordan Museum (J 9529), seems to be the representation of Zeus-Sarapls. It dates from the 2nd-3rd century B.C. and is 29 cm in height. It is similar to another head in Amman, which comes from Jerash and represents the god Asklepios. These Greek gods were identified with Osiris during the Ptolemaic Period in Egypt. A terracotta figurine of "mourning Isis" and an Egyptian votive statuette of a priest holding Fig. 15. Male statue with African features and Egyptian style (J 11260). an image of Osiris come from Petra (figs. 16; 17). They were found by Professor Hammond in a temple dedicated to the goddess of Petra, Al Uzza who was identified with Isis. Although the terracotta figurine of Isis dates from the end of the 2nd century B.C., the Egyptian statuette dates from the Late Period of Egypt, Dynasty</page><page sequence="11">EGYPTIAN ART IN JORDAN 209 Fig. 16.

Relief of a mummified image with Osirian features. a mummified image in a semi-profile position with crossed arms over his chest (fig. 18). His hands are holding what may have been the Osir- ian agricultural elements. On his head, he wears what appears to be an "atef" crown with a uraeus springing out, front.20 He wears a wide beaded collar that reaches almost to his shoul- ders. Obviously this figure is the representation of the god Osiris. Fig. 19. Relief of a human body with an animal face hold- ing a staff in the right hand. The second relief at the Italian Hospital is clearer and represents a human body with an animal face (fig. 19). It is depicted totally in profile and holds a staff in the right hand which ends in a type of platform where a monkey or perhaps a baboon is sitting down. He holds a bird in his left hand. His crown is also composed of a solar disk in between two huge uraei, which could also be horns, since the head clearly is that of a ram. He also has a broad beaded collar and wears a tunic which is fastened below his breast. At the front by his waist, the tunic is of the Italian Mission. They were formerly attached to different walls in the same area of the Citadel. Today they stand at the door of the Italian Hospital in Amman. The reliefs are uninscribed and very deteriorated after standing many years in the open. Dr. Fawzi Zayadine brought them to my attention indicating their Egyptianized style. ^u In the center of the crown a round object can be distin- guished, perhaps a solar disk. The rest of the face and head are also very unclear but in the back of the head, what ap- pears to be a horn stands out. At the front, a uraeus is visible. In a depiction in the tomb of queen Tawosret, in the Valley of the Kings, Osiris wears similar crown, plumes, uraeus and horns. Between the tall plumes he has a small solar disk, and the white crown of Egypt.</page><page sequence="13">EGYPTIAN ART IN JORDAN 211 pleated and clings to the body.21 This figure may be a representation of the god Amun. Both the baboon and the solar disk indicate the solar na- ture of the god. Both reliefs have similar mea- surements 108 cm height, 52-55 cm width and 46 cm thickness and both stone blocks are made of grey limestone and topped with a cavetto cor- nice, a typical Egyptian feature.22 The third relief was uncovered in the Citadel in Amman (fig. 20). It is made of grey limestone and has similar measurements to the other two. Its height is 108 cm, its width 50 cm. It lacks most of the head and represents a goddess, her headdress, or part of her wig, falls behind he back and partly over her right shoulder in front. She has a staff ending in a lotus flower in her left hand. Her right arm is extended next to her body and is partly lost. She wears a broad beaded collar and a bracelet on her left arm which is dis- proportionate to her body and crudely drawn. Her breasts are uncovered, the right breast is not delineated, but the left is depicted in profile showing its full form. Below her breasts she wears a sheathed skirt fastened by a fringe. This trim- ming also runs at the front from the breast to the hem, which is also fringed. The skirt presents the same type of pleated design as the dress of the god in the other relief. The female's feet are bare, very crudely and disproportionate to each other. The right foot looks deformed, the left one looks as if it had an ankle bracelet or a san- dal, which could be one of those Roman sandals that cover the foot up to the ankle.23 Obviously these three reliefs are related since most of the iconographic features they present are parallel, as are their measurements and craftsmanship. They also belong to the Greco-Roman Period, since they are similar to representations from the temple of Dendera in Upper Egypt. This temple was dedicated to the goddess Hathor. Fig. 20. Relief of a goddess with wig and a lotus flower in her left hand. Minor Art Objects A glass perfume flask in the Jordan Museum (J 14632) dates from the 5th-6th century B.C. and comes from Umm Udhaina. Although it is 21 In the temple of Hathor-Isis at Dendera there is an image of the god Amun holding a bird in his hands. On the top of his head he has a uraeus in between the horns. In the same temple an image of the king shows he is wearing a similar style of sheathed and pleated tunic as our figure. 11 The two reliefs are a pair. Perhaps they were part of the pylons at the entrance to a temple in the Citadel. Most of the iconographic features they present indicate that both pieces belong to the Greco-Roman Period of Egyptian History. However they are imitations of Egyptian representations and are clumsily done. 1 Another indication that these reliefs may have been produced during the Roman Period. Scenes on the Roman area of the temple of Dendera in Upper Egypt present many of the features depicted in these reliefs. For instance, the birds offered by the king, and the pleated costume he wears. The solar aspect of the reliefs is also an indication that they were probably part of a Roman temple in the Cita- del. The temple was perhaps dedicated to Hathor or to Isis who was identified with Hathor, who also has a cultic area in Dendera. The construction of this important temple be- gan during the Old kingdom, was continued by Thutmosis III and finished by the Ptolemies. The Roman emperors also added to the temple leaving their images and car- touches. The most important monument of the temple is the massive gateway of Domitian and Trajan (81-117 A.D.).</page><page sequence="14">212 JARCE XXXVII (2000) Fig. 21. Bronze figurine of the Horus child (J 11695). described as a Greek vase, its colors and detail are very much as the glass style of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. A bronze figurine, also in the Jordan Museum (J 11695), represents the Horus child. He is nude, wears the lock of youth on the right side of his head and takes a finger to his mouth (fig. 21). The statuette is crowned with plumes and is the typical Egyptian iconography of the Horus child during the Late Period. Three objects in the Deir Alia Museum, which are probably Egyptian-made are a fragment of a yellow and blue faience vase with the car- touche of Queen Taorset, the last queen of the 19th Dynasty. An Egyptian seal stone (DA 2020) of blue and white faience has an inscription with the prenomen of Ramses II, also from the 19th Dynasty: Nb tSwy Usr Mot Rc stp n Rc, "Lord of the two lands, strong in right is Ra, chosen of Ra." The last epithet was added to his name after the second year of his reign 1277 B.C. The third ob- ject is a red limestone scarab (DA 2810) with the cartouche of Thumosis III of the 18th Dynasty. In conclusion, most of the objects described above are of a New Kingdom style, with some exceptions such as those belonging to the Late and Greco-Roman Periods. During the 18th and 19th dynasties the incursions of Egypt into Syro- Palestine were perhaps larger, more numerous and aggressive. They likely had more publicity. Subsequently, the material culture left along the Egyptian path at this time is more abundant and it appeals more to Egyptian religion and thought. During the Late Period the influence is not as dominant as before. The Greco-Roman Period starts a new dominant culture: the Helleniza- tion of the Mediterranean world and the Levant; Egypt was no exception. The result is a blend of Egyptianized art with Greco-Roman attributes adapted to the native needs. These objects do not comprise all the Egyptian and Egyptianized arti- facts found in Jordan. But they give an idea of the quantity of the material and of the lasting legacy left in Transjordan by Egypt. Afterwards, tracing the objects on the map, a steady pattern emerges as a double line following the campaign trails of the Egyptian kings along the King's Highway.
