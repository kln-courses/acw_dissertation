<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Tony Jackson University of North Carolina, Charlotte A Response to Joseph Carroll Joseph Carroll’s essay, “An Evolutionary Paradigm for Literary Study,” gives us  a solid overview of evolutionary psychology and literary study. In my response I  will address a few major points in hopes of spurring yet more written conversation.  Carroll wants to institute, not just another paradigm, but in fact the paradigm  for literary study. (More specifically, he wants to undo the continuing reign of  poststructuralist-derived theory.) A Darwinian approach, he writes, should “ulti- mately...subsume all other approaches to literary study.” Taking this even further:  “if evolutionary psychology can give a true and comprehensive account of human  nature, it can ultimately encompass, subsume, or supplant the explanatory systems  that currently prevail in the humanities” in general. On the one hand this seems  true. If the brain is the result of natural selection, and if the mind is a function of the  brain, then evolutionary psychology would seem to be a rock-bottom explanatory  paradigm for all things mental. But on the other hand this fact does not justify the  kind of necessity that Darwinian critics often want to establish.  Carroll wants to make the case that any literary-interpretive practice that does  not overtly stake itself on evolutionary-psychological theory will be at least inad- equate, if not simply invalid. Even work that emphasizes cognitive-scientific ideas  over evolutionary-psychological ideas does not pass muster. For instance, Carroll  rejects attempts to theorize a ‘cognitive poetics’ that is not plainly also evolutionary  psychology. “Efforts to segregate cognitive poetics from evolutionary literary study  are doomed to failure.” This is necessarily the case, he claims, because the “human  mind has functional cognitive mechanisms for precisely the same reason that the  human organism has complex functional structures in other organ systems—because  it has evolved through an adaptive process by means of natural selection.” Of course  it’s true that knowing the ultimate function of an object of investigation matters for  fully understanding the nature of that object. But I don’t see how it follows that all  discussions of that object must feature a discussion of its ultimate function; and in  particular why a discussion of whatever element of a living organism must feature a  discussion of evolution. Would this also mean, for instance, that a non-evolutionary  212 Style: Volume 42, Nos. 2 &amp; 3, Summer/Fall 2008 </page> <page sequence="2"> A Response to Joe Carroll 213 explanation of the way the liver works is doomed to failure? Carroll’s comments on Lisa Zunshine’s use of Theory of Mind (ToM) in her  Why We Read Fiction make this even clearer. “Despite her appeal to selected bits of  evolutionary psychology,” he writes, “Zunshine strongly emphasizes the ‘cognitive’  aspect of her views, muting and minimizing their sociobiological affiliations. Beyond  ‘ToM,’ she declines to attribute any very specific structure to the adapted mind.”  As Carroll admits, Zunshine does not ignore evolutionary psychology; still, by not  making it the focus of her work, she has segregated herself from the explanation  that matters. But Theory of Mind is an element of our cognitive apparatus whether  or not we discuss it directly in terms of evolution. Zunshine’s book—based on the  notion that ‘cognitive psychology’ and ‘evolutionary psychology’ are not simply  different names for the same thing—chooses to make the case about the specific  cognitive function(s) of ToM in relation to fiction. To fault examples of cognitive  literary study as Carroll does here is, as Lawrence Shapiro observes, to be “overly  zealous” in “applying evolutionary theory to psychological questions” (253).  For literary study that in no way includes evolutionary psychology, the situ- ation is worse, for Carroll seems to take it that leaving out evolution will neces- sarily render a given explanation somehow false. We see this when he addresses  the recurrent question of whether the Darwinists have actually produced any new  readings of literature. Carroll claims that the real question is: “Can the Darwinists  produce formulations that are not only new but true?”: the implication being that  the other side is constantly making new, but false, claims. There are at least two  responses to this. First, it’s hard to see how any new paradigm can succeed if it does  not generate new knowledge. Second, it is possible to make valid claims in spite of  beginning from false or incoherent grounding positions. Many post-structuralist- derived literary-critical claims about the unconscious operations of race, class, and  gender, for instance, have been straightforwardly true of our actual world, whether  or not their understanding of human nature is valid.  I want to be clear that I’m not saying professional scholars should be satisfied  to make claims based on false logical grounds. They should not. To my mind any  serious scholar should be willing and able to deal seriously with the most serious  challenges to his or her own positions. But if such challenges are to stand a chance  of being seriously attended to, it will matter how they are made. Carroll tends  regularly to overstate his case, and this works to antagonize the very audience he  most wants to persuade.  I turn now to another issue—anthropomorphism—which is a regularly occurring  problem with evolutionary-psychological approaches to literary study. Darwinism  </page> <page sequence="3"> 214 Tony Jackson is revolutionary because of its incorporation of chance and determinism. The always  mind-wrenching, originary fact is that the order of life happened by chance. In the  most general event-scenario, a random genetic mutation occurs in an organism; and  if by chance the environment favors the outcome of that mutation, then that mutation  will have a likelihood of becoming part of a changed order of living things. The  process, like all natural processes, is entirely mechanistic. Given this foundational  fact, we must constantly be on our guard not to impute some anthropomorphic,  decision-making power to nature. And yet this regularly happens.  I’ll consider two quick, related examples: design and problem-solving. Carroll,  like so many other writers on evolution, speaks of “the adaptive problem [a given]  behavioral disposition would have solved in ancestral environments.” Even more  telling is phrasing about “the adaptive problem these complex structures [ie, the  arts] are designed to solve” (italics added). Now, the idea of ‘design’ has always  been necessarily contentious in evolutionary theory, because we have to speak of  order arising by chance. In my opinion we should not use the word ‘design’ because  in normal usage it entails a conscious designer, and these normative entailments of  specific words matter, especially in the context of evolutionary theory. We see this  also with the idea of evolution as ‘problem-solving.’ To characterize evolution as a  problem-solving process is necessarily to assume some unproblematic, right kind  of being toward which the natural process must be moving. In fact it assumes what  I have to see as a covert form of intelligent design. Of course it is hard not to use  our everyday words, and therefore hard not to anthropomorphize in this way. But,  again, especially in the context of explaining culture and psychology in terms of  evolution, this kind of usage needs to be avoided, or at least qualified. With anthropomorphism we have a case of natural processes being understood  as if they were somehow human in a general sense. Now we turn to a case of ele- ments of nature being understood as if they were elements of a specific culture.  This tendency shows up when Carroll makes the key generalization that literature  “embodies an intuitive folk psychology at its highest level of articulation.” What  is the standard by which such a judgment can be made? From what neutral, non- culturally-biased perspective could we assess—actually we would be evaluating—a  given articulation of folk psychology as higher or lower than another? Why wouldn’t  the visual arts be highest? With respect to literature in particular, as soon as we  make such a judgment, we automatically institute a similar kind of evaluation  with respect to specific examples of literature. If literature is the highest articula- tion of folk psychology, then there will necessarily be some examples of literature  that more highly articulate that psychology than do others. To make claims like  </page> <page sequence="4"> A Response to Joe Carroll 215 this is to read, unwittingly I assume, natural phenomena as cultural phenomena.  Darwinists deeply undercut their own authority if they fail to realize, or at least to  acknowledge, when they are doing this. To this point I have addressed what I take to be crucial, if largely rhetorical,  problems that are common both to Carroll’s essay and to the interdisciplinary use  of evolutionary psychology more generally. Now I’ll address a more substantive  issue. Carroll wants to make the case for the adaptive nature of the arts, and of  literature in particular. To this end, he turns to ideas put forth by E. O. Wilson in  Consilience. Both Wilson and Carroll claim that the arts appeared in human life  because of a downside to the evolution of our specifically human intelligence.  Higher intelligence enabled the human animal to detach itself from purely automatic,  instinctive responses to the world, and to deal with “contingent circumstances and  hypothetical situations” in ways that no other creature can. But the proliferation of  ‘mental scenarios’ detached from instinct produces a potential chaos in organizing  motives and regulating behavior. The arts produce images of the world and of our  experience in the world. Those images mediate our behavior and the elemental  passions that derive from human history. The arts are thus an adaptive response  to the adaptive problem produced by the adaptive capacities of high intelligence.  In another phrasing we read that the “disposition for creating [literary] im- ages would have solved an adaptive problem that, like art itself, is unique for the  human species: organizing motivational systems disconnected from the immediate  promptings of instinct.” Now, unless I just entirely misunderstand, I don’t see how  this could reasonably explain the ultimate function of literature and the arts. We  have an initial evolutionary change: the increase of intelligence. But that intel- ligence cannot function without what comes after it: the arts. So, without the arts  the change in intelligence will evidently have no organization, or at least not the  kind of organization that will make it functional. In fact disorganized, proliferating  mental scenarios sound to me like a state of dream or hallucination. How could  such a change ever be adaptive in the first place? How could such a creature ever  effectively deal with the world at all? How can this be squared with any usual no- tion of cause and effect? Carroll seems to be aware of this problem later when he  writes that the “capacity for producing emotionally charged imaginative artifacts  developed in tandem with the capacity for producing an imaginative virtual world.”  Now, we have intelligence and its organization happening, not in sequence, but at  the same time. I still don’t see how this could work. To conclude, I’ll say that I feel fairly confident about my comments on anthro- pomorphism and value-judgments. But in criticizing Carroll’s explanation of the  </page> <page sequence="5"> 216 Tony Jackson adaptive function of art, I wonder if I have gone past my own knowledge. Maybe I  just don’t know the evolutionary-psychological theory well enough to understand  what Carroll, who is much more broadly-educated in evolutionary psychology than  I am, actually intends. This is an unavoidable risk in getting involved in interdis- ciplinarity. But of course Carroll has taken on the much larger risk. A scholar who  crosses disciplinary lines as he has done, risks not only failing to know the other  field (evolutionary psychology) adequately enough to satisfy scholars in that other  field, but also of failing to explain ideas from the other field in such a way that the  relatively un-educated in his or her own original field (literary studies) can under- stand them. One way or the other a significant portion of both audiences must be  satisfied if there is to be a successful interdiscipline. To conclude, whether or not the new paradigm emerges as Carroll hopes, I am  glad that there are scholars like him, who are willing to take these kinds of risks. </page> </plain_text>
