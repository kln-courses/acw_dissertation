<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity Jon Kertzer In Wallace Stevens's poem "The Course of a Particular," the cry of win- try leaves provokes a shift in mood from robust assurance that "one is part of everything" to a depleted sense of the world drained of meaning: The leaves cry. In the absence of fantasia, without meaning more Than they are in the final finding of the ear, in the thing Itself, until, at last, the cry concerns no one at all. (Palm 367) These two dispositions-one expansive and gregarious, the other con- tracting to the vanishing point of consciousness-suggest two comple- mentary responses to literature. I will be concerned with the latter, which tries to acknowledge the uniqueness of a literary work; but it must first be set against the "fantasia" whose absence it announces in order to trace a path of diminishing returns. My purpose is to explore the rhetoric of singularity in order to detect its "final finding," that is, its aesthetic and ethical limit. My hope is that artistry and ethics will converge: the course of a literary particular leads to ethical discovery. According to Stevens, however, such a discovery "concerns no one at all."This hardly sounds like a strong moral position,1 and defining that position in relation to the artistry that exposes it will be my subject. My own path, which runs from the numerous to the singular, requires some signposts. I intend, first, to mark the path's two limits by contrasting a criticism of plenitude with a criticism of austerity; then to inspect some rhetorical devices through which singularity is indicated; then to show Twentieth-Century Literature 50.3 Fall 2004 207</page><page sequence="2">Jon Kertzer how this rhetoric isolates the here-and-now in the instant of its incep- tion and deception, its birth and death; and finally to examine how an aesthetic of singularity raises a comparable ethical challenge that sets moral generality against the dignity of the unique. Stevens will serve as one of my guides. The shipwreck of the singular When studying any literary work, we customarily nudge it in two direc- tions, though not in equal measure. Usually we relate it to other texts in an expanding pattern of interdependence within larger contexts and communities. Whether the terms of explication are historical, cultural, biographical, national, generic, or religious, a work gains significance within a wider field to which it contributes, however modestly. No artist or artifact has its meaning alone, T. S. Eliot advises in a famous dictum, because it participates in an "ideal order," a totality that is temporarily complete yet continually altered as new works are added to it (38).A text is intelligible through its relation to other texts: as one elegy in an elegiac tradition, or as an American lyric, or as a novel by Virginia Woolf, or as an example of women's writing, and so on. At the imagined limit of this expansive view lies a glimpse of all literature conceived as one ongoing discourse-a grand intertextual poem, myth, or conversation forever in progress. Northrop Frye provides one of the most daring modern attempts to see literature steadily and to see it whole by fitting every work into a vast network of modes, myths, and genres,2 all combining in a sublime vision of cultural totality corresponding to what Eliot calls "the mind of Europe" (39). A poem is like a single thought within that mind. As the critic's field of vision expands, however, individual works be- come more and more significant, yet less and less discernible as they are engulfed by the whole. Ideal readers catch every allusion and influence, but at the cost of losing the shock of first discovery. As a countermeasure, they try to savor a literary work not in relation to other writing but in and for itself. It may be another eighteenth-century, middle-class novel written by a Protestant man for women readers, but it is this particular text and not another one, read here and now, not elsewhere. How are we to account for its specificity? Even an ardent advocate of intertextual- ity like Harold Bloom admits, "There can be no poem in itself, and yet something irreducible does abide in the aesthetic" (Western 23). 208</page><page sequence="3">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity Although the specificity of a literary work may strike us forcefully on first reading, it is difficult to define because all the modes of definition at our disposal have the perverse effect of depriving a work of its particu- larity. Explanations inevitably generalize. Whether we explain a text by means of categorization, analogy, paradigm, function, influence, or geneal- ogy, the process of understanding in each case is contextual and systematic. It is relational, whereas specificity is what precedes any relation and then enters into it. Do the primary units have any identifiable standing before they contribute to a larger structure of meaning, or are they created only by the act of being differentiated within it, just as left has no meaning until paired with right? Even analyzing a poem into its constituent parts fails to disclose its particularity, because analysis is possible only if we are already able to recognize those parts and their functions.To do so requires that we rely on general structural principles, which specify the parts as parts in the first place. In this case, to specify does not mean to isolate what is unique in a poem but to draw from a repertoire of established practices. To analyze a sonnet into quatrains and tercets is to recognize it as a sonnet, and so to relate it to a conventional lyrical category. If the imagined limit of the expansive critical view is a total literary universe where "one is part of everything," the limit of the contracting view is irreducible singularity--"the thing / Itself" apart from all else. Neither extreme is attainable, but the path to the first is more inviting than the path to the second. The first promises glory, the second threatens ruin. The first is accommodating, because it finds room for everything, whereas the latter founders on what George Oppen calls the "shipwreck / Of the singular": Obsessed, bewildered By the shipwreck Of the singular We have chosen the meaning Of being numerous. (151) Meaning is never really a matter of choice, since we cannot live without it, and it is always "numerous" in the sense that it is relational and participa- tory. To understand is to relate, and relations always proliferate. The chal- 209</page><page sequence="4">Jon Kertzer lenge, therefore, is to renounce the numerous with its fantasy of totality in order to focus on singularity, even if it invites disaster. Indeed, we seem to be offered a choice between too much or too little-either the disaster of unassimilable multiplicity or the shipwreck of singularity. Stevens succinctly calls the former a fecund "principle," the latter a chaste "particle" (Palm 215). Principle pushes the imagination to "a point / Beyond which thought could not progress as thought"; particle pulls it to "a point / Beyond which fact could not progress as fact" (229). Because each extreme leads Stevens's character, Canon Aspirin, to "noth- ingness," it is tempting to seek a common ground accommodating both. But accommodation is itself an activity of expansive critical intelligence, as it aspires to "the whole, / The complicate, the amassing harmony" (229). The challenge to imagine the singular remains. According to Bloom, we treasure "something irreducible" in each poem, which is all the more precious for the enigmatic immediacy of its appeal. Even Frye, the great systematizer, agrees that criticism can only give knowledge about literature, which is quite different from actual liter- ary experience felt on the pulse. The original pulsation has no voice of its own, because critical understanding is founded on a direct experience which is central to criticism yet forever excluded from it. Criticism can account for it only in critical terminology, and that terminology can never recapture or include the original experience. The original experience is like the direct vision of color, or the direct sensation of heat or cold, that physics "explains" in what, from the point of view of the experience itself, is a quite irrelevant way. However disciplined by taste and skill, the experience of literature is, like literature itself, unable to speak. (Anatomy 27) The dilemma of critical knowledge is captured in the oxymoron "aes- thetic distance." Sensory or aesthetic experience is direct, not distanced. Criticism makes the immediate experience of art intelligible only by rendering it less and less immediate. It speaks about art by preventing it from speaking for itself. Theory establishes the general principles and preconditions from which literature arises, yet theory itself is belated, al- ways trailing after "the direct experience of literature, where uniqueness is everything" (Anatomy 361). Generalizing on this dilemma, Jean-Frangois 210</page><page sequence="5">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity Lyotard argues that philosophy can never comprehend the instantaneous "gesture" made enigmatically by art. Aesthetic presence is punctual, whereas philosophical understanding is postponed: The artist asks of us philosophers that we think the perceptible singularity that is presented here and now: a work or works that are here, now, in the singularity of their occurrence. But we should bear in mind that this possessive of occurrence is only reconstituted by memory after the fact. (75) Because understanding lags behind the experience that it interprets retro- spectively, it will always miss the singularity of its object. It will be baffled by a unique gesture that "no mode of thought is capable of thinking" directly, only of reconstituting in a displaced form: the fact that there is a gesture in space-time-matter, the fact that it is there and is a gesture-constitutes the impenetrability of the work for thought. It is precisely to the level of this enigma that the artist obligates the philosopher to place or displace his thought, and this is so whether the artist is aware of it or not. It is up to the philosopher, in the awareness of his debt, to know this for both himself and the artist. (75-76; Lyotard's emphasis) How are we to acknowledge literary uniqueness, when any systematic explanation of it must rely on generalities? In opposition to a critic like Frye, who enlarges his theoretical gaze to accommodate everything, is Paul de Man, who renounces such gran- diose presumption by forcing poetic thought back toward particularity, knowing very well that it can never achieve its goal. Both critics under- take pilgrimages to the limit of thought, though in different directions, and both find their efforts thwarted by the very nature of literature, whose vitality springs from a uniqueness that theory can only dissipate. But whereas Frye patiently constructs a baroque system culminating in a glorious "anagogic" vision that compensates us for the original loss, de Man follows the opposite course. He devises an ascetic path leading to the expiry of meaning in singularity-the final finding that concerns no one at all. He agrees that literature itself is unable to speak, but he respects its muteness by resisting the appeal of comprehension-the inclusiveness of critical thought. According to Tobin Siebers, "Generality is the hallmark of 211</page><page sequence="6">Jon Kertzer the kind of theory that de Man most opposes" (100) because he believes that "[p]hilosophical generality is the death of genuine self-knowledge" (120). He renounces comprehension because it is driven by a will to power through violent totalization. As a corrective, he stubbornly resists theory's philosophical tendency to convert the unique into the general by summoning the arsenal of rhetorical disfiguration and erasure associ- ated with deconstruction. By these means he retraces the course of the particular almost to the point of nullification. Insofar as something is truly unique, it is unknowable and unsayable, because knowing and saying both rely on signification, which operates through equivalences: this for that, signifier for signified.The unique eludes the web of signification because it is not comparable or equivalent to anything else. It is solely itself; as soon as equivalence is found, uniqueness is lost.To propose any analogy or relationship, even contrast, which requires some commonality on which to distinguish the contrast, would be to forfeit "something irreducible" abiding in the aesthetic. I begin, therefore, by offering Frye and de Man as opposing responses, each daring in its own way, to the need for criticism to respect aesthetic singularity even as it relies on theoretical generality. The word accommodate suggests what Frye welcomes and de Man repudiates: the spaciousness of thought. In the comprehensiveness of literary appreciation, Frye finds a sublimity that restores to literature the splendor of the innumerable, dis- crete poetic moments on which his grand system rests. For de Man, on the other hand, literature's value lies in its uncanny ability to dismantle all equivalences and renounce all compensations until we can almost imagine the uniqueness of being. Where Frye's critical vision culminates in the timeless copresence of all literature, de Man's confines itself to a random instant. The cost of this austere revelation is devastating, for we must ac- cept, de Man concludes bleakly, that nothing, whether deed, word, thought or text, ever hap- pens in relation, positive or negative, to anything that precedes, follows or exists elsewhere, but only as a random event whose power, like the power of death, is due to the randomness of its occurrence. (Rhetoric 122) To Frye, this inchoate world of dislocated singularities would look like hell. 212</page><page sequence="7">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity Its single emptiness Given a choice between an all-encompassing totality and an all-exclud- ing singularity, most literary theorists nowadays would probably choose neither. The present climate of opinion welcomes pluralities of all kinds- multicultural, heteroglossal, polysemic, interdisciplinary-but under two competing conditions. First, these pluralities must never be subsumed within a single overarching system; and second, they must never pretend to be autonomous. In exploring the rhetoric of singularity, then, I might seem to be backing the wrong horse. I am not eager to follow de Man's example, only to show that whether we grasp the specificity of a literary work by emulating his critical self-martyrdom, as Siebers calls it (117), or by thinking austerely with "a mind of winter," as Stevens advises in "The Snow Man" (Palm 54), we require some analogy to express a poetic individuality that precedes any analogy and will be falsified by it. Ironi- cally, we require a double strategy to contemplate singularity. Because analogy invites us into a "fantasia" of correspondences that entice us to become "part of everything," we must first consider but then decline the invitation through a policy of denial, isolation, or annulment. In Stevens's terms, we must reject a principle in order to isolate a particle. Here are a few rhetorical tactics that allow us to particularize. A simple but intriguing way of evoking singularity is through in- sistence, as in Gertrude Stein's refrain: "A rose is a rose is a rose." Each repetition narrows the focus, as one flower belonging to the large class of roses is finally distinguished as this rose and no other. In her lecture "Composition as Explanation," Stein explains (repeatedly) that repeti- tion is her way of "groping for a continuous present" small yet capacious enough to include everything:"I naturally made a continuous present an including everything and a beginning again and again within a very small thing" (518-19). As her novel The Making ofAmericans mushroomed to a thousand pages, however, she realized that she could only cherish a thing's particularity by marking its difference from all other small things. Her singular style had to show not only that we always live in a present stuffed with innumerable details, but that the present is forever changing-"if it is all so alike it must be simply different and everything simply different was the natural way of creating it then" (519). At the limit of this contracting process she finds an enigma. As a single object like a rose is progressively isolated from everything else, it loses the commonality it shares, first with 213</page><page sequence="8">Jon Kertzer other flowers, then with other roses, until it stands solitary but indefinable even as a rose. It is not this flower or this rose but merely this. The deictic this recalls the insistent gesture concluding Stevens's poem "The Man on the Dump": "Where was it one first heard of the truth? The the" (Palm 164). This poem drastically shrinks its focus until it points not at the thing itself but at the verbal function (the definite article) through which things are specified. Here is an act of specifying without content. Another, less esoteric example of definition through insistence appears in Martin Amis's enthusiastic praise for Philip Roth: "There aren't supposed to be degrees or intensities of uniqueness, and yet Roth is somehow inordinately unique. He is bloodymindedly himself, himself, himself" (290). Amis makes a show of defying logic by placing Roth in a class by himself. If his peculiar style pervades his writing, then it is recognizable for being repeated, but that repetition is traced back to a unique source-presumably Roth's creative personality-which cannot be named, only circled relentlessly and marked out by that circling.These examples suggest that the rhetoric of singularity is positional and indica- tive; that is, it seeks ways of pointing from a distance at an untouchable source-the rose itself, the unique personality, the the. Another gestural tactic is the hapaxlegomenon, a word that appears only once in a document or corpus, such as a neologism or unrecog- nizable word. Whereas Stevens resorts to the definite article, a word so common that it has no meaning of its own, other writers imagine words that can be used only once. In practice, a word that is truly unrepeated or unrepeatable would be incomprehensible. Iterability makes words both intelligible and ambiguous, because they can only be understood when they are used and shared, yet reiteration also makes them constantly change their meaning in new contexts. If they were never repeated, they might seem frozen at the moment of utterance, pure but without reso- nance. A. M. Klein uses the Hebrew form millot bodedot ("words alone," corresponding to "hapax legomena") to evoke this magical insularity: Isolated words. Lonesome words.They occur but once in the whole Torah, and are related to no other word. In English, or rather in Greek, they are called hapaxlegomena, words of single occurrence. Once, only once, do they appear in the Bible, and then are not heard from again. (Notebooks 131) Even to cite a hapaxlegomenon is, perversely, to destroy it by using it a 214</page><page sequence="9">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity second time, thus converting it into common currency. Instead, Klein accords exclusive value to the word of single occurrence by identifying it with God's divine fiat-"let there be light"-a genesis that occurs only once. The poet imitates this creative moment by "uttering" a fictional world, and Klein's eloquent example from "A Portrait of the Poet as Landscape" illustrates how quickly the single utterance proliferates into a fantasia of correspondences: Look, he is the nth Adam taking a green inventory in world by scarcely uttered, naming praising, the flowering fiats in the meadow, the syllabled fur, stars aspirate, the pollen whose sweet collision sounds eternally. (Poems 638-39) The hapaxlegomenon is performative-a self-creating word-but as Zailig Pollock shows in his commentary on Klein, it must also be self- destructive if it can be performed only once. There is a demonic parody of the hapaxlegomenon in the death sentence: the irrevocable word that hangs over us all and that, for Klein, finds its worst exclamation as a nuclear explosion or the Holocaust (Pollock 207-08). Both genesis and death decree, the singular word is ascribed an uncanny power exerted at either the very beginning or the very end of things. Or more correctly, it offers a way of imagining how beginnings begin and where endings end. Because of its proximity to creation and destruction, it is too dangerous to touch. Anne Carson asks why neolo- gisms should be so disturbing, and answers: If we cannot construe them at all, we call them mad. If we can construe them, they raise troubling questions about our own linguistic mastery.We say "coinages" because they disrupt the economic equilibrium of words and things that we had prided ourselves on maintaining. A new compound word in [Paul] Celan, for example, evokes something that now suddenly seems real, although it didn't exist before and is attainable through this word alone. It comes to us free, like a piece of new air. And (like praise) it has to prepare for itself an ear to hear it, just slightly before it arrives-has to invent its own necessity. (134) A neologism has to prepare for its own coming; otherwise it cannot be 215</page><page sequence="10">Jon Kertzer received intelligibly at all. "Coinage" suggests a fresh minting of mean- ing, but the image is wonderfully inappropriate, since singularities are not commensurate with other things and therefore cannot be exchanged for them. Their value is not economic but inspirational, as Klein shows. Perhaps that is why both poets immediately associate the creative burst of language with praise, but also with irrationality. The same is true of my third example, catachresis, which is the other side of the coin. If neologisms upset the equilibrium of words and things, and the hapaxlegomenon is a word without a thing, then catachresis is a thing without a word. Also known as abusio, it is a strained metaphor ("take up arms against a sea of troubles") but is also used to point at some- thing with no proper name of its own. Common examples are table leg, book leaf and mother tongue. Here again, the verbal economy is disrupted by an odd performance. In most metaphors one term is substituted for another, but there can be no substitution of a figurative word for a literal one if the literal one does not exist. Instead, we have what the witches in Macbeth ominously call "A deed without a name" (4.1.49). In the heyday of deconstruction, catachresis was regarded as the abusive rhetorical deed par excellence. Jacques Derrida treats it as the way language strains between sense and reference (59-60);J. Hillis Miller sees it as a primal misnaming that lurks in all words (19-20); de Man calls it "[t]he trope which coins a name for the still-unnamed entity, which gives face to the faceless" ("Lyrical Voice" 57), and he warns: Something monstrous lurks in the most innocent of catachre- ses: when one speaks of the legs of the table or the face of the mountain, catachresis is already turning into prosopopeia [per- sonification, literally "to give a face"], and one begins to perceive a world of potential ghosts and monsters. ("Epistemology" 19) As Klein's Adamic poet illustrates, these metamorphoses quickly prolifer- ate into a hallucinatory fantasia, but only after they have been invoked by an unnameable singularity that remains faceless and wordless. It is the power of speech that has not yet been spoken, the inhuman substratum of humanity to which de Man's analysis constantly leads him. In his wintry mood, Stevens annuls the creative fiat invoked by Klein by abjur- ing personification and relinquishing metaphor (even if he must do so metaphorically) in order to return to the instant before light emerges from the first sound: 216</page><page sequence="11">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity In this bleak air the broken stalks Have arms without hands. They have trunks Without legs or, for that, without heads. They have heads in which a captive cry Is merely the moving of a tongue. Snow sparkles like eyesight falling to earth, It is in this solitude, a syllable, Out of these gawky flitterings, Intones its single emptiness, The savagest hollow of winter-sound (Palm 247-48) Here is a deed without a name, a form without a shape, a word without a meaning.The poem's imagery pinpoints singularity at the convergence of light, sight, and sound by evoking a temporality in which the pres- ent is isolated in the precision of its immediacy. It focuses not on a rich, contemplative moment as in Marvell's "The Garden" or Milton's "I1 Penseroso," and not on Stein's bulky continuous present, but on the here- and-now, which is always singular, always transient, and always different. The last Onset Right here, right now, Stevens says in "Man Carrying Thing,""The bright obvious stand motionless in cold" (Palm 281), but the reality so brilliantly revealed stands only for an instant. In the rhetoric of the instantaneous, the bare present, which vanishes as we touch it, is more elusive than the past, which can be exhibited by memory, and more elusive than the fu- ture, which can be anticipated. Past and future join in the comfortable continuity of a "major reality"-an explanatory myth like Frye's-that poets entice us to enjoy but also warn us to resist whenever we retreat to the cold, solitary present.These rival dispositions again offer a rhythm of elevation and relapse in "AsYou Leave the Room": 217</page><page sequence="12">Jon Kertzer Now, here, the snow I had forgotten becomes Part of a major reality, part of An appreciation of a reality And thus an elevation, as if I left With something I could touch, touch every way. And yet nothing has been changed except what is Unreal, as if nothing had been changed at all. (396) A "major reality" seems fully tactile yet proves to be specious or "unreal." It is a lofty fantasy that appreciates in value under the aegis of imagina- tion, but then must be depreciated imaginatively in its turn. In "The Sail of Ulysses" the "particular thought" is a "difficult inch," which is eas- ily coaxed into "Plantagenet abstractions" and "stellar largenesses"; but Stevens warns that the poet must also resist the "law / that bends the particulars to the abstract" (392) in order to face the present in its strange momentariness. It is the barely imaginable reality that first provokes sen- sation and cognition. Time, sight, and thought converge in the image of light-one of Stevens's favorites-as in the common expression "to see things in a flash." Singularity, sensed fleetingly as the brilliant intersection of time, being, and thought, finds more familiar expression in the modern fascination with photography, for instance in Roland Barthes's Camera Lucida. The click of a shutter and the illuminating flash mark the beginning of another double strategy whose goal is to reclaim the present: What the Photograph reproduces to infinity has occurred only once: the Photograph mechanically repeats what could never be repeated existentially. In the Photograph, the event is never tran- scended for the sake of something else: the Photograph always leads the corpus I need back to the body I see; it is the absolute Particular ... the This ... the Real, in its indefatigable expres- sion. (4; Barthes's emphasis) Here again is a preoccupation with first and last moments, with cognition and recognition, with first utterance and last breath. Barthes, too, imagines singularity as a mere "This," which he can only point to from a distance 218</page><page sequence="13">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity measured by the lapse between taking the photograph and viewing it later. The creative instant is characterized by "contingency, singularity, risk" (20), which Barthes sums up nicely in the figure of"surprise" (32), a jolting discovery that lies "outside of meaning" (34) yet is the precondi- tion for any subsequent understanding.The second, recuperative moment is characterized in various moods as interpretation, objectification (13), nostalgia, and justice (70), but also, since the past is gone forever, as mel- ancholy, mourning (79), and catastrophe (96). Modernist poetics, especially in its early formulation as imagism, also stresses the singularity of visual or tactile stimulus in conjunction with intuitive thought and spontaneous language. The best-known examples are Ezra Pound's definition of the poetic image as an emotional and intel- lectual complex released instantaneously (4) and T. E. Hulme's equating of meaning with sight and touch, in contrast to the tardiness of sound (77-78). A better example for my purposes is D. H. Lawrence's attempt to cast off tradition and aspiration (past and future) in order to formulate a poetry of the immediate present: But there is another kind of poetry: the poetry of that which is at hand: the immediate present. In the immediate present there is no perfection, no consummation, nothing finished. The strands are all flying, quivering, intermingling into the web, the waters are shaking the moon... .We look at the very white quick of nascent creation. A water-lily heaves herself from the flood, looks around, gleams, and is gone.We have seen the incarnation, the quick of the ever-swirling flood.We have seen the invisible.We have seen, we have touched, we have partaken of the very sub- stance of creative change, creative mutation.... Give me the still, white seething, the incandescence and the coldness of the in- carnate moment: the moment, the quick of all change and haste and opposition: the moment, the immediate present, the Now. (85-86) For Lawrence, the present is at once the most palpable and the most in- tangible of states. He associates it with the quick of life, which he pictures as a creative spark that ignites change but cannot share in it, since it lives only in the instant of its passing. He condenses this paradox in the word "still," which ambiguously suggests both quietude and continuance, sta- sis and motion: "the still, white seething." Most revealing is the way his 219</page><page sequence="14">Jon Kertzer imagery links vitality to death (here the trope is as much romantic as it is modernist), because life is felt most intensely at the instant of its loss. Similarly Barthes identifies the ageless photograph with mourning, and de Man in a quotation above associates particularity with both random energy and "the power of death." These examples suggest that the course of a particular comes into focus if we imagine it situated in a present that expires as soon as it occurs, and is only known when it haunts us afterwards. Dylan Thomas evokes such a moment in "A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London," a Second World War elegy that steadfastly refuses to lament a child's death in the Blitz and then concludes: "After the first death, there is no other" (192). Because we die only once, contemplating the instant when life ceases-a traditional, devotional exercise-can give ecstatic assurance of the uniqueness of our being, which is most precious at the moment of loss. Following his own double strategy, Thomas draws on religious imagery (Zion, synagogue, sackcloth, "stations of the breath") which he renounces in order to lament all the more strongly. He, too, evokes a comforting fantasia-the ceremonies of mourning, the solace of religion and the afterlife-only to reject their comforts through a series of oratorical denials stretching from the first word ("Never") to the last ("no other"). Some readers may interpret this poem as subtly (or not so subtly) reaffirming the religious faith that it makes a show of denying, as it mourns for the dead child by pretending not to. But we might also hold Thomas to his word: after the first death, there is no other.3 De Man identifies lyric poetry with two mutually exclusive kinds of mourning. The more familiar is expressed in the lyrical impulse to establish a tem- poral harmony that humanizes death through a "pathos of terror": to mourn is to cling to the past and so to preserve it, however painfully, as ongoing testimony to the value of one's grief. The more stringent form of mourning offers no such comfort. It insists on looking death in the face by refusing even to personify a face: True "mourning" is less deluded. The most it can do is to allow for non-comprehension and enumerate non-anthropomorphic, non-elegiac, non-celebratory, non-lyrical, non-poetic, that is to say, prosaic, or, better, historical modes of language power. (Rhetoric 262; de Man's emphasis)4 As the parade of negations indicates, we are back in de Man's world of 220</page><page sequence="15">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity random events, which precede any historical continuity and resist being assimilated into it.Viewed in this way, Thomas's refusal to mourn is not a way of defying death or of triumphing over it but of submitting to its power by relinquishing past and future and renouncing even the pathetic continuity of bereavement. The death of a child thus portrays most poi- gnantly what must be true of all people at any moment: all are unique, mortal, and therefore irreplaceable. Dying may take a lifetime, but death is instantaneous. The desire to isolate the final second of life by filling it with all the significance that is about to vanish appears in proverbial notions such as prophesying with one's dying gasp, like John of Gaunt in Shakespeare's Richard II; or hav- ing one's life flash before one's eyes, as in Ambrose Bierce's story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" and in A. M. Klein's poem "And in that drowning instant," which condenses not only an individual life but the Jewish diaspora into its glimpse of a "preterite eternity" (Poems 609). Literature is full of fine death-bed scenes, and none more poignant than Bottom's theatrical death throes in A Midsummer Night's Dream: Thus die I, thus, thus, thus. Now am I dead, Now am I fled; My soul is in the sky. Tongue, lose thy light; Moon, take thy flight. Now die, die, die, die, die. (5.1.295-302) The joke is that the last moment goes on and on and on, yet when the noblemen scoff, Demetrius: No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one. Lysander: Less than an ace, man; for he is dead, he is nothing. (5.1.303-304) they illustrate how death is painful proof of a uniqueness that language strains to express. Through their wordplay, dying becomes gambling-a bet that we all lose-and singularity (the ace, or single spot on the die) is proclaimed only as it is nullified. Compare this bombastic display of mortal singularity with three other examples. The first concludes Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilych," when Ivan's prolonged suffering grants a charitable insight that ultimately re- 221</page><page sequence="16">Jon Kertzer deems him from the futility of his life. As he feels his son kissing his hand, he is surprised by a joyful intuition, which is expressed as falling, as light, as release from pain, and as the euphoric temporality of dying: There was light instead of death. "So that is it!" he suddenly said out loud. "What happiness!" All of this took place in an instant, but the significance of that instant was lasting. For those present his agony continued for another two hours. Something rattled in his throat, his ema- ciated body twitched. But gradually the wheezing and the rat- tling ceased. (283) A similar pattern appears more ironically inYuri Olesha's story "Lyompa" which again entices the reader toward the unimaginable, in this case by inventing the odd word that serves as the title. Critically ill, Ponomarev turns away from all the bubbling, snorting sounds that animate his house. In contrast to a young child, whose world is expanding explosively as he discovers a bewildering fertility of things that he cannot name, Ponomarev feels reality contracting: First, the number of things on the periphery, far away from him, decreased; then this depletion drew closer to the center, reaching deeper and deeper, toward the courtyard, the house, the corridor, the room, his heart.... Death was destroying things on its way to him. Death had left him only a few things, from an infinite number.... The vanishing things left the dying man nothing but their names. (142, 144) Fading into abstraction, he is left with a lone, absurd hapaxlegomenon, which he associates with a noisy rat in the kitchen: He knew that at any cost he must stop thinking about the rat's name. But he kept searching for it, knowing that as soon as he found that meaningless, horrifying name, he would die. "Lyompa!" he suddenly shouted in a terrifying voice. (145) The word is all the more frightening for naming the unnameable. My third example is Emily Dickinson's poem "I heard a Fly buzz-when I died" (223-24), in which light, sight, and sound again converge at the moment of death. The speaker patiently awaits "the last Onset" (death as oxymoron), wills her "Keepsakes," and finally concentrates on the "uncer- 222</page><page sequence="17">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity tain stumbling Buzz" of a fly. Like Olesha's rat, it becomes the focal point of her expiring life, its tiny furious energy revealing all that she is about to lose. Instead of wordplay or neologism, Dickinson ingeniously contrives a reflexive doubling that turns insight into blindness, as if a word could be in oxymoronic relation to itself: And then the Windows failed-and then I could not see to see- I noted that the rhetoric of singularity is positional: it points from a distance at an untouchable source. In these last examples, the configura- tion fixes on a contracting point-the dead center-where the powers of speech and vision are confounded at the moment of revelation. This pattern is familiar in mysticism, but it is also a formation that Elaine Scarry ascribes to the perception of pain. Although aesthetic experi- ence is usually associated with pleasure-or with the vicarious pleasures of tragic, pathetic, or sentimental pain-pain demonstrates even more forcefully the severe concentration of particularity. Pain concentrates the present moment with the severity of its command; or as Pascal said with epigrammatic polish: "The present usually hurts.... it afflicts us" (39, my translation). In Scarry's account, as the world contracts for the torture victim (32-33), the self is first isolated and then dissolved (47), until the "absolute privacy" of its suffering becomes confused with utter self-ex- posure (53).An experience of pure interiority deepens until it is suddenly externalized. Pain, she argues, is the one somatic state that has no object in the external world: desire is desire of x, fear is fear of y, hunger is hunger for z; but pain is not "of" or "for" anything-it is itself alone. This object- lessness, the complete absence of referential content, almost pre- vents it from being rendered in language. (162) For this very reason, however, it incites an imaginative fantasia-a "dense sea of artefacts and symbols" (162)-that never suffices to render the uniqueness of the experience, and therefore circles it restlessly. The name Lyompa is such a symbol-without-reference, while Dickinson's self-nul- lifying phrase, "I could not see to see" evokes such an experience-with- out-object. Scarry's analysis of this phenomenological pattern explains why intense physicality so readily finds expression as intense spirituality. It also illuminates Stevens's oracular decree that the course of a particular 223</page><page sequence="18">Jon Kertzer gradually excludes all others until it "concerns no one at all."The absolute privacy of pain obliterates everything but the self, suffering here and now; then the strange singularity of death obliterates even the self.We experi- ence the pain of dying, but how do we experience our death? The supreme dignity of the unique A religious response to the above discussion would see the course of a particular as a moral path leading to God. "One is one and all alone and ever more shall be so," sings the refrain of an English folksong celebrating the original singularity, and the singular originality, of the divine source of life.5 Alexis de Tocqueville speculates that God alone does not require general ideas because "[a]t a single glance he sees separately all of the be- ings of which humanity is composed" (411). Because the human mind cannot encompass such bewildering variety, it must reduce "the immen- sity of detail" to inexact generalities: General ideas do not attest to the strength of human intelligence, but rather to its insufficiency, because there are no beings in nature exactly alike: no identical facts, no rules indiscriminately applicable in the same manner to several objects at once. General ideas ... never provide it with anything but incom- plete notions, and they always make it lose in exactness what they give it in extent. (411) A religious sensibility must acknowledge the precious uniqueness of each soul, a uniqueness expressed, for instance, in Egyptian mythology where the god Anubis weighs souls after death but never finds two with exactly the same weight.6 At the beginning of this essay I wondered what moral footing might be offered by an aesthetic insight that, in Stevens's words, grows "less and less human" (Palm 264) until it "concerns no one at all." Through its very exclusiveness the rhetoric of singularity poses an ethical challenge, since in each of my examples the unique moment of sensory impact, of illumination, of the here-and-now, of pain and death, is simulta- neously a moment of moral awakening and its frustration. Ethical conduct depends on the duality arising from a practical, principled confrontation between oneself and another person for whom one is responsible or to whom one is answerable. Each example discloses personal responsibil- ity-what one owes to others (Tolstoy, Thomas, Klein), to the social and 224</page><page sequence="19">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity physical world (Olesha, Stein, Lawrence), or even to oneself (Dickin- son)-but it does so just as one's power to exercise that responsibility is lost. The unique moment vanishes just as its demand is felt, its loss only heightening the perplexity of the obligation. In Kant's famous formula- tion, "ought implies can": we can be morally obligated to perform only actions that are within our power. To be obliged to perform an impossible or unknowable act is meaningless, because "duty commands nothing but what we can do" (Kant qtd. in Stern).7 The paradox of literary singularity, which is impenetrable to the critical understanding that explicates it, thus corresponds to a comparable ethical dilemma. Ethical insights, like aesthetic ones, become intelligible only within a larger system framed by general principles and rules, but that very generality dispels the uniqueness of the insight and the urgency of its call. Individually what we encounter is not duty as an abstract principle but my need to act here and now. The ethical imperative occurs instantaneously; only later can we assess its wider implications. Zygmunt Bauman explains the dilemma as a contrast between duty and responsibil- ity: Only rules can be universal. One may legislate universal rule- dictated duties, but moral responsibility exists solely in interpellat- ing the individual and being carried individually. Duties tend to make humans alike; responsibility is what makes them into indi- viduals. Humanity is not captured in common denominators-it sinks and vanishes there. The morality of the moral subject does not, therefore, have the character of a rule. One may say that the moral is what resists codification, formalization, socialization, universalization. (54; Bauman's emphasis) Like de Tocqueville, Bauman sees generality as an enabling limitation of human thought that conflicts with the particularizing imperative of ethi- cal being.What I called the expansive critical view, which sees literature as one vast system, finds a partner in the Kantian ethical tradition, with its categorical imperative that submits every personal decision to the strin- gent test of universality: "What we call good must be an object of desire in the judgment of every rational man, and evil an object of aversion in the eyes of everyone" (Kant, Practical 80). Far from concerning "no one at all," desire for the good requires that "one is part of everything."8 For Kant, the test of both aesthetic and moral judgments is universality. The 225</page><page sequence="20">Jon Kertzer paradox of aesthetic experience is summed up in the notion of taste, un- derstood as a subjective universal. As the metaphor of sensory taste implies, aesthetic experience is purely subjective, a pleasurable feeling, yet it is also disinterested, without ulterior purpose, and universal-a "necessary delight" enjoyed by all who share the same "common sense" (Boos 20).9 We can distinguish "good" and "bad" taste concerning the beautiful only within a community of shared responses, a community whose standards Kant treats as universal. Similarly, ethics is rooted in our "sensible nature" (Kant, Practical 80) with its urgent demands of the moment. The good, like the beautiful, is commanding: it imposes itself directly; it is thrilling. Nevertheless, morality is intelligible only as a social discipline based on general rules impartially applied. Ethical encounters transpire through the interplay between personal will and social law (81), between discrete experience and universal rule. However, their interplay is asymmetrical rather than harmonious. Slavish conformity to the rule obscures the jus- tice of individual cases; excessive insistence on peculiarity (the exception to the rule) threatens the law's authority. There is always a tug-of-war between generality and specificity. In this contest, Kant ensures that the general always commands the specific: rational law must be the a priori determination of the particular will. However, maintaining this deductive pattern requires what he calls a "paradox of method": "The concept ofgood and evil must not be determined before the moral law (of which it seems as if it must be the foundation), but only after it and by means of it" (82; Kant's emphasis). Rules are not framed in accordance with what is good; rather, the general law precedes the discrete experiences from which it seems to arise: "it is the moral law that first determines the concept of good, and makes it possible, so far as it deserves the name of good absolutely" (83). Modern theory tends to twist this paradox in the other direction by asserting the priority of the particular over the general, as is illustrated by a comment from Ludwig Wittgenstein's notebook: "ethics presupposes the uniqueness of life" (qtd. in Greisch 74). "Presupposes" suggests that the uniqueness of the moral agent comes first as the precondition of moral generalities, which then follow inductively. Responsibility precedes duty; or in Fabio Ciaramelli's words, Ethical obligation arises not from the logical and ontologi- cal universality of reason which discloses to knowledge criteria 226</page><page sequence="21">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity for freely determined action, but rather immediately from the uniqueness of the moral situation itself..., moral obligation takes hold immediately, before understanding or decision on the part of the subject. (85) The philosopher who argues most passionately and enigmatically on behalf of ethical singularity is Emmanuel Levinas. From Levinas's richly opaque writing, I wish to stress only how he of- fers the novelty of the self as an enigmatic point of departure for all ethical encounters-as a radical singularity that permits duality yet remains aloof from it. He begins with a customary clearing of the rhetorical ground. The singular self ("ipseity") is not displayed in essential qualities: it is not a "distinguishing characteristic, a unicum or a hapax, like fingerprints"; it is not an ego, agent, consciousness, or "individuated quiddity resulting from any incomparable quality inherent in the body or character, or the unicity of a natural or historical conjuncture" (Basic 84). Ethics begins before any of these have been formulated with the summoning of "an indefeasible unity." The precious uniqueness of each soul is marked not just when it expires at death, but when it is startled into moral being. This is the first onset: the instant when "the essential, primary and fundamental structure of subjectivity" (Ethics 95) is constituted through an "assignation" between two solitary selves who realize themselves only through that encounter. "The ego is an incomparable unicity" (Basic 114) that must be "troubled" from its passivity into moral, intellectual, and social consciousness. This occurs when the "uniqueness of the I" (55) confronts the "nameless sin- gularity" (85) of the "face" of the Other: Before the neighbor I am summoned and do not just appear; from the first I am answering to an assignation. Already the stony core of my substance is dislodged. But the responsibility to which I am exposed in such a passivity does not apprehend me as an interchangeable thing, for here no one can be substituted for me; in calling upon me as someone accused who cannot reject the accusation, it obliges me as someone unreplaceable and unique, someone chosen. Inasmuch as it calls upon my responsi- bility it forbids me any replacement. (143) "[T]he I qua I is absolutely unique" (28), but it only asserts its uniqueness when summoned to responsibility by another "pure individual" (7). 227</page><page sequence="22">Jon Kertzer Like de Man, Levinas wants to imagine the disconnected particu- larities of being before they are rendered intelligible by "the labor of thinking" (Basic 153), which then disposes them into general categories. The moral moment precedes thought and therefore cannot be thought ("thematized"). Its irreducible specificity is prior to all the systems of definition that I listed earlier (analogy, category, causality, etc.), and ac- cording to Levinas, it even precedes the fundamental structure of sym- bolic exchange that makes linguistic signification possible. It is therefore unspeakable and unknowable (85), although it provides the primary unit from which speech and knowledge will arise. Happily, where this anarchic state made de Man think only of death, it makes Levinas think of life: This is the bursting forth of incessant novelty. The absolute nov- elty of the new. This is the spirituality of transcendence, which does not amount to an assimilating act of consciousness. The uninterrupted bursting forth of novelties would make sense, pre- cisely beyond knowledge, through its absolute and unforeseeable novelty. (155) Stevens imagines the original cry of life as a wintry genesis: a syllable that intones its single emptiness. For Levinas, however, it is "a cry of ethi- cal revolt, bearing witness to responsibility" (147) as it sounds the first moral injunction: "The first word of the face is the 'Thou shalt not kill.' It is an order. There is a commandment in the appearance of the face, as if a master spoke to me" (Ethics 89).10 The moment when moral power is summoned is also the moment when it is restrained in view of "the supreme dignity of the unique" (101). In this dramatic account, genesis (emergence of selfhood), mortality (awareness that one could kill the Other) and responsibility (altruism) are all revealed instantaneously. What poet could achieve more? Ethics and aesthetics again exhibit the same structure, but now a specific obligation or artistic response is not subsumed within general rules or aesthetic forms; instead, the particular stubbornly resists the generality to which it contributes.This asymmetrical relationship appears in one of Levinas's phrases, "Nous n'est pas le pluriel de Je" (qtd. in Bauman 48)-the soli- tary I is not absorbed by a collective we. And he expresses this paradox not as poverty but as excess. In contrast to de Man's ascetic withdrawal is Levinas's prophetic affirmation of responsibility as startling, commanding, overwhelming, transcendent. Precisely because the atomic I precedes any 228</page><page sequence="23">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity rational, social, or psychological articulation of its character, when sum- moned into proximity with the Other it is awed by the transcendence of limitless responsibility: "I am responsible for a total responsibility, which answers for all the others and for all in the others, even for their responsi- bility.The I always has one responsibility more than all the others" (Ethics 99). In defiance of fairness, adequation, harmony-of any rational judg- ment-he invokes "[t]his surplus of being, this existential exaggeration that is called being me" (Basic 17). "For Levinas, the ethical shows itself as the prophetical" (Ciaramelli 92). If we look to literature for prophetic moments when singularity encounters its own excess, we find them most readily in romance and in the sublime.We are back in Northrop Frye's territory. Frye treats romance as a transgressive genre that foresees not a return to the stability of family, duty, and political order but revolutionary transformation. It exhibits not the circularity of comic restoration but a spiral of creative revelations. Comedy offers restitution; romance promises deliverance. Comedy offers justice by granting characters what they deserve; romance grants more than they deserve. Frye finds a remarkable expression of redemptive singu- larity in the romantic motif of the threat to virginity, often accompanied by risk of torture or sacrifice (Secular 80). While these threats obviously express patriarchal conventions of male dominance and female modesty, for Frye they also point to "a vision of human integrity" menaced by the one fate which really is worse than death, the annihilation of one's identity... .What is symbolized as a virgin is actually a human conviction, however expressed, that there is something at the core of one's infinitely fragile being which is not only im- mortal but has discovered the secret of invulnerability that eludes the tragic hero. (86) Romances are about the loss and recovery of identity, but that unique core of being cannot really be described. Identity feels all the more fragile when it is threatened, yet it is "a state of existence in which there is noth- ing to write about," a state that romances gesture at from a distance by invoking an earlier ("once upon a time") and a later ("they lived happily every after") time beyond record (Secular 54). In the meantime, where all stories occur, what protects the "beleaguered virgin" or faithful wife (or heals her if she is sacrificed) is not so much the intrepid male hero as "a certain redemptive quality" (87) inherent in her patient, untouchable 229</page><page sequence="24">Jon Kertzer singularity.11 Virginity cannot be touched or "known" either conceptually or physically, since what is touched is not virginity but only its apparent loss. "[W]hat is objectively untouched symbolizes what is subjectively contained," Frye states quaintly of a wonderfully fertile purity, a virginity that is "perpetually renewed ... in a world where every experience is fresh and unique" (153).This, too, may be a male fantasy, but it also expresses an energy that perpetually animates the novelty of an innocent world.Work- ing within the conventions of romance, it "emphasizes the uniqueness, the once-for-all quality, in the creative act" (184). Or in Stevens's words, it marks "an immaculate beginning" (Palm 209). The final scene in Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, where the faith- ful wife Hermione apparently is resurrected, can be seen as an example of aesthetic and ethical creativity corresponding to Levinas's notion of ethical awakening. After the first death-Hermione's patient 16 years in hiding, which enacts a kind of chastity-there is a magical rebirth through the recreation of life through art: the statue comes to life to the sound of music. Her resurrection is a gift in excess of the occasion. Just as the earlier sacrifice of Leontes's innocent son Mamillius is far worse than justice demands, his wife's return to life is far better than any reward commensurate with his expiation of his sins. Remorse cannot reanimate the dead. Nor does the found daughter Perdita replace the lost Mamillius, since no unique self is equivalent to any other self.When Levinas speaks of the self as "hostage'" he is not referring to a fair substitution of one for the other but to an "involuntary election" (Basic 121-22). Similarly, the final moment in The Winter's Tale points to a power beyond moral cal- culation-a blessing. With startling simplicity Leontes's words, "0, she's warm" (5.3.109), evoke the shock of aesthetic and moral insight, the sudden gesture whereby a scene that in realistic terms would be absurd becomes enchanting. Finding moments of transcendent particularity in Stevens's poetry is tricky, because for all his love of"transport"-the triumph of delight over bare fact-he expresses his triumphs ambiguously or achieves only a "satisfaction" of reason or imagination (Necessary Angel 42). To be satis- fied is to find enough (Latin: satis), not to pursue excess.Whereas Levinas prophetically announces "[t]his growing surplus of the infinite that we have ventured to call glory" (Basic 144), Stevens is more diffident. In "Sail- ing After Lunch" he foresees only a "slight transcendence to the dirty sail" (Palm 112) of his craft; in "Extracts from Addresses to the Academy of Fine Ideas" he proposes that the world's familiar climate is enough: 230</page><page sequence="25">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity There is nothing more and that it is enough To believe in the weather and in the things and men Of the weather and in one's self, as part of that And nothing more. (183) And in "Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour" he concludes mod- estly: Out of this same light, out of the central mind, We make a dwelling in the evening air, In which being there together is enough. (368) Only "together" hints that the unique self is not self-sufficient but must probe beyond limits. The same hesitancy appears in section 7 of "The Man with the Blue Guitar," which first proclaims, "The blue guitar / And I are one," but later asks if one can ever remain all alone: I know that timid breathing.Where Do I begin and end? And where, As I strum the thing, do I pick up That which momentously declares Itself not to be I and yet Must be. It could be nothing else. (139) The haunting phrase "that timid breathing" recalls the first hint (and last gasp) of life in The Winter's Tale, but as it leads to a "momentous" (momen- tary, crucial, imperative) assignation with an Other, Stevens seems wary of venturing too far, as if the glory might fade if affirmed too romantically. One can twist Stevens into any convenient shape-Emersonian, Nietzschean, Santayanian, Derridean, etc.12-and I would like to avoid contriving a clumsy application of Levinas's ideas to the poetry. Instead, we should hope for a coincidence of mood, image, or situation, since Levinas delineates his drama of solitude, summons, and transcendence in such lyrical terms.The two dispositions with which I began this essay can lead Stevens, on the one hand, to an omnivorous imagination that con- sumes whatever it surveys; and on the other hand, to a dense solipsism that recognizes the Other only as a stunted expression of oneself. The former appears in "Anecdote of the Jar" (Palm 46), where the artifact placed on a hill in Tennessee composes the landscape (just as "Tennessee" and the 231</page><page sequence="26">Jon Kertzer "anecdote" are themselves compositions) by taking dominion over it.13 The latter appears in images of confinement or monotony. His provoca- tive question, "Where / Do I begin and end?" is often posed in such a way as to leave the reader uncertain how to proceed. Nevertheless, in his essay "The Figure of the Poet as Virile Youth," when Stevens asks only for "satisfaction" of reason or imagination, he promptly suggests that "an idea of God"just might satisfy both and so would provide "a sanction for life" (Necessary Angel 42-43). His coy understatement ("This is an illustration") cannot disguise the enormity of his intimation: such a sanction (blessing) would "momentously" exceed any egotism. Similarly, "Academic Dis- course at Havana" begins skeptically by restraining the lusty imagination with its promise of glory ("perfect plenitude," "ornatest prophecy"), but through the chastening of thought it raises a hope that poetry still might achieve "An infinite incantation of our selves" (Palm 87-89). "Credences of Summer" (287-92) offers a final illustration of how aesthetic particularity can be troubled into opening an avenue to ethical insight. Here is a modest example of Klein's Adamic poet discovering the world, but its peaceful evocation of summer is upset by anxieties ex- pressed in oxymorons and paradoxes. Instead of being frozen in a wintry present, the poem is poised at "the axis of everything" between "spring's infuriations" and "the first autumnal inhalations." Its celebration of ripe- ness ("green's green apogee") is an odd occasion to look for the virginity of the particular, yet the season is so fruitful that it reveals an "essential barrenness": "This is the barrenness / Of the fertile thing that can attain no more." If the instant of death marks the summation of life, then this moment of completion " [b]eyond which there is nothing left of time" is the summation of the year. Stevens stresses the uniqueness of the present and of the perspective that it affords by isolating the here and now."Now" the poem begins, here at "[o]ne of the limits of reality," the landscape's festival of light, sight, and sound pinpoints attention on "the very thing and nothing else .. . [w]ithout evasion by a single metaphor." (Levinas notes that the "oneself" lives "without metaphor, which palpitates" [Basic 84]). Here and now "[i]t comes to this"-the unassigned demonstrative pronoun marking a particularity without defining it-"and we accept what is / As good.The utmost must be good and is." To find sensory and contemplative joy in a summer day is necessarily to appeal beyond oneself to the earth and its vital gifts."Dear life redeems you," proclaims Paulina in The Winter's Tale (5.3.103), and Stevens's speaker 232</page><page sequence="27">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity claims more modestly to be "appeased" by the generous scene. While Frank Kermode feels that the subject of"Credences" is "total satisfaction" (106), most readers have been less convinced (Jarraway 225).The limit of reality should be a place where belief (credence) is justified and desire is fulfilled ("Exile desire / For what is not"), but by section 5 the rhythm grows restless as the speaker wonders about the goodness that he has just argued himself into affirming. Some dissatisfaction turns his meditation into what Charles Berger calls the "dark countersong" of a "counter- sublime" (83, 86), as it questions the relation between "concentred self" and Other, between particular and general. Does the valiant particular dominate generality ("One day enriches a year") as the jar claimed-both heroically and absurdly--to dominate Tennessee; or does a defining gen- erality ennoble all its particulars ("Or do the other days enrich the one")? Where do I begin and end? The beginning is the "rock" (section 6)-unique, "extreme," el- emental, conveying no secret meaning ("hermit's truth") beyond its bare existence "on this present ground." The end is more difficult to foresee, because Stevens persists in renouncing the traditional solaces of romance or the egotistical sublime (section 7). As he explains of a similar situation in "Angel Surrounded by Paysans": "the point of the poem is that there must be in the world about us things that solace us quite as fully as any heavenly visitations could" (Letters 661). The visitations in "Credences" arrive with the awakening call of the trumpet (section 8) and cock (sec- tion 9), which can be compared to Levinas's "cry of ethical revolt, bearing witness to responsibility" (Basic 147), at least in the sense that they herald a challenge from the world beyond the self that forever implicates the self. For Levinas, too, ethics is an "awakening" that "designates the improb- able field where the Infinite is in relationship with the finite without contradicting itself by this relationship. . . . The Infinite transcends itself in the finite" (Basic 146). Stevens would agree with the last sentence. His trumpet does not herald the resurrection of the dead, only of the sum- mer with its virginal fertility. The "resounding cry" urges us to "share the day." It not only startles the mind into awareness of its own precious existence, but makes it "aware of division ... [a]s that of a personage in a multitude." Commenting on these lines,Justin Quinn argues that Stevens's specific landscape in Olney, Pennsylvania, is "already woven through with social meaning by the generations of the people who have lived here" (119), and therefore the "multitude" refers not to abstract humanity but 233</page><page sequence="28">Jon Kertzer to a local community "with its ceremonies, family ties, and transmission of cultural and ethical values" (118).The scene draws the speaker into its intimacy. The cock, too, is a "civil bird" that momentously makes "a sound / Which is not part of the listener's own sense," and which urges him to speak his part in "[t]he huge decorum, the manner of the time, / Part of the mottled mood of summer's whole." What the self earns here is not dominance but dignity. Notes 1.There is little moral advantage in Joseph Carroll's summation of "The Course of a Particular": In the absence of fantasia, these two aspects of particularity, the self and the world, are equivalent in their meaninglessness. Stevens repudiates essential unity, but he does not then revert to a celebration of the parts of the world.The failure of transcendental affect leaves him at the nadir of the cycle from Romanticism to indifferentism. (306) 2. This is the effort of Frye's whole career as a critic, not just of a single work, but Anatomy of Criticism presents his widest view of literature. 3. Other readings of this poem note allusions to Revelations 2.11: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death" and to Revelations 20.6: "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the sec- ond death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years." 4. De Man's use of "historical" is deliberately provocative, since he is not ap- pealing to a historical explanation but to the rhetorical ground of historical narratives: "One would then have to conceive of a rhetoric of history prior to attempting a history of rhetoric or of literature or of literary criticism. Rheto- ric, however, is not in itself an historical but an epistemological discipline" ("Epistemology" 28) 5. "Green Grow the Rushes O" is a song with a pagan version (http://www. paganlibrary.com/music_poetry/greengrow_rushes.php) and a Christian ver- sion (http://www.know-britain. com/songs/green_grow_the_rushes-o. html), both celebrating the divine source of life and reveling in its multiplying power. 6. I owe this point to Philippe Beaussant: "c'est Anubis qui p&amp;se les ames de l'autre c6t&amp; de la mort et n'en trouve pas deux qui aient le meme poids" (259-60). 234</page><page sequence="29">The Course of a Particular: On the Ethics of Literary Singularity 7. Stern collects and analyzes 11 instances where Kant expresses this principle. 8. Ciaramelli explains: The ethical project, then, is to submit freedom of will to the rule of rationality in the attempt to find criteria for human action that are universally intelligible and valid for everyone. In this way, particular hu- man situations are subsumed under a general and universal order from which they receive their meaning. (84) 9. Kant writes: Consequently the judgment of taste, accompanied with the conscious- ness of separation from all interest, must claim validity for every man, without this universality depending on objects. That is, there must be bound up with it a title to subjective universality. (Judgment 46) Stephen Boos explains subjective universality as follows: A judgment of taste is ... not a logical judgment but an aesthetic one, by which Kant means a judgment whose basis is subjective. On the other hand, an aesthetic judgment is not simply a matter of the agree- able, since it makes a claim to universality.When I claim that x is beau- tiful, I am not simply claiming that I feel that it is beautiful but making a claim that is valid for others as well.... When we judge an object as beautiful rather than merely pleasant, one judges not only for oneself but for everyone else, that is, one judges with a universal voice, yet one does so without a concept, that is, without a category of the Un- derstanding. To make this demand is to presuppose that the taste and feeling by which we make the judgment is common to everyone and hence implies a sensus communis, a "common sense." (19-20) 10. Leonard Grob explains the first moral cry as follows: Before the totality is rent by the manifestation of the face, there can be no will to act immorally, as there can be no will to act morally, in any ul- timate sense of that word.... Morality makes its first appearance when I confront the Other who is truly Other. Although the Other appears to me now, on principle, as someone I could wish to kill, he or she in fact summons me to respond with nonviolence: I am called to willingly renounce my power to act im- morally.What I hear from the Other, Levinas claims, are the words "Thou shalt not kill."
