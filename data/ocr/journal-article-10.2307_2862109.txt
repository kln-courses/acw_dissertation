<plain_text><page sequence="1">James Holstun. A Rational Millennium: Puritan Utopias of Seven- teenth-Century England and America. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987. x + 371 pp. No price given. This is a difficult book for a historian to review fairly. It is written in a language of literary theory not easily comprehensible to those who have not learned it. It contains a number of minor but unnec- essary historical errors (e.g., pp. 248, 265, 266). A phrase unknown to historians, "commons [sic] lands" or "commons [sic] grounds," occurs too often to be a printer's error. Professor Holstun defines "Puritan utopia" as "a literary form, political rhetoric, and social practice that envisions the displaced populations of early modern Europe and North American as the raw materials for an act of millennial poiesis" (p.3). But he limits his dis- cussion to three individuals -Sir Thomas More, John Eliot, and James Harrington. Eliot, theocratic millenarian, is the only one among them normally regarded as a Puritan. The word hardly seems to fit the heretic-burning More: Holstun sometimes describes him as an "early modern" or "renaissance" utopian. The secular minded Harrington uses millenarian language: but he too is an im- probable Puritan. Writers briefly mentioned but not seriously dis- cussed include Bacon, Andreae, Campanella, Comenius, Plattes, Baxter, Neville. Of these only Baxter is generally accepted as a "Pu- ritan. " What Professor Holstum sees as uniting More, Eliot, and Har- rington is their concern with "displaced persons" who require "dis- ciplining." "The fantasy of universal discipline" is "at the centre of Puritan utopia" (p. 300). "Displaced persons" include Indians or Pu- ritan settlers in North America, English vagabonds, the people of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 6oi England generally as Holstun thinks Harrington saw them. The New Model Army was a utopian institution, "the product of an en- counter between a displaced population (the revolutionary troops in need of discipline) and a number of authority [sic] texts" (p.8 8). Holstun supposes that the New Model "inspired Harrington's meditations on the relations between land tenure, military discipline and political power" (p. 3 5). (Surely Tawney established that the his- torical theory which Harrington adopted antedates the civil war?) Harrington was not, as Holstun suggests, faced with "formless building material" and he didn't want to settle people on the land in accordance with a model (pp. 179-80, i67-68): his starting premise was that new property relations had arisen. "The displaced popu- lation, " Holstun states, "may cause the utopist to turn to or write an organizing text, or his text may bring him to look for a population on which to try it out" (p. 3 5). Either way he sees the activity as pri- marily literary. Eliot and Harrington, he agues, operate within the same system of conventions "by constituting an enlightenment cri- tique of anthropomorphic monarchy and oligarchy, by speaking in the Lycurgean voice of self-consuming political authority, and by proposing an organizational means to the millenium" (p.276). Another uniting theme is that the "Puritan utopian writing is an act of withdrawal in anticipation of an expansion" (p. 102) -by which Holstun means military expansion. The accusation of impe- rialism against More and Harrington is an old one: the charge hardly fits Eliot, still less Winstanley. If Holstun had read Nicholas Canny he would have learned much about the transference of the ideas he is discussing from Ireland to North America-the disciplining of populations who had no settled property, imperial expansion to cul- tivate idle and waste lands. Perhaps Spenser's View ofthe Present State of Ireland was a "Puritan utopia"? Yet there is much of interest in Holstun's book, especially his study ofJohn Eliot, neglected by historians of political ideas. Hol- stun has points to make about Harrington, though he is badly astray on Milton ("a profoundly apolitical conception of heroism informs both the poetry and the prose"); according to Holstun, the desperate Ready and Easy Way "cuts itself off" from its political circumstances (p.264; cf. pp. 25 5-60). The concluding chapter contains many dis- cussable ideas. Holstun rightly attacks the idea that utopia must rep- resent "the encroachments of the totalitarian state" on "the belea-</page><page sequence="3">602 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY guered individual" (p. 267). Remarks like "the character book is the inverse of utopia" (p.270) are worth pausing over. Over the past generation the disciplines of literature and history seemed to be converging, to their mutual advantage. It is sad, for historians at least, that some literary critics now adopt a coterie lan- guage which makes their work virtually inaccessible to non- initiates.
