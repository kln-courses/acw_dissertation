CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="2">Wind Energy In California A NEW BONANZA by Robert W. Righter The history of California is noted for unan ticipated bonanzas. Now it appears a new bonanza has presented itself. As the state approaches the twenty-first century an unlikely resource?the wind?has assumed an unforeseen significance. On the mountain passes, deserts, and hills of California, close to 16,000 turbines produce over ninety percent of the wind-generated electric ity produced in the United States, enough for the electrical needs of nearly one million residents.1 These wind generators represent not only usable electricity, but also validation of the idea that solar renewable energy can be more than mere talk. How did this happen? Other states have equal wind resources, some superior. Yet California has been and is the leader. In its early history, of course, the wind produced by prevailing westerly air cur rents invading the coastline proved pivotal. It trans ported early sea voyagers such as Cort?s, Cabrillo, Drake, and Vizcaino north from Mexico, first reveal ing the country and its peoples to European eyes. In the decades to follow, the salt water wakes of hun dreds of deep-water sailing ships provided the invis ible paths of culture, commerce, and conquest. However, if we limit the definition of wind energy to terrestrial use, we must turn to water-pumping windmills. On this subject, the prevailing viewpoint suggested that the 'American windmill" entered the West from the East, the invention of New Englan der Andrew Halladay. However, research by Roger Manning revealed that local craftsmen working for W. I. Tustin of Benicia, California, constructed a windmill by 1849. Five years later Tustin's workers were building self-regulating windmills and dis tributing them widely around San Francisco, Sacra mento, and Stockton. By 1860 a number of small companies produced windmills. By 1861 the wind mill exhibit at the California State Fair had its own judging committee, Stockton was popularly called the "City of Windmills/' and hundreds of windmills lined the west side of the Central Valley and else where throughout the state. Light, inexpensive, self regulating, and easy to maintain, windmills often accompanied the settlers' cabins, liberating abundant groundwater for a soil-rich, but rainfall-poor region.2 By 1875 midwestern windmills did capture the Cal ifornia market, but the early dominance of locally produced windmills indicated that the state was not so technologically primitive or dependent upon east ern manufactured goods as was commonly believed. These early windmills could provide drinking water for man and beast, and perhaps enough for a garden, but large-scale irrigation was out of the question. Therefore, by the turn of the century, farm ers turned first to kerosene and gasoline pumps, and then to electric water pumps to meet their needs. This soaring rural demand for electricity by the early twentieth century presented an opportunity that private energy companies, such as the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, were pleased to fill. Whereas farmers and ranchers elsewhere were unable to entice electric companies to string wires to rural regions, financial capital flowed into the Cen tral Valley and other agricultural areas of California. In 1920, only ten percent of American farmers enjoyed central electricity, but twenty-five percent SUMMER 1994 143</page><page sequence="3">of California farmers were hooked to central power.3 Those without central power assumed that it would soon come. Thus, whereas thousands of farmers and ranch ers in more electrically deprived regions of the West looked to the new wind turbines to provide them with electricity, in California no similar need existed, and thus the state lagged behind others in the devel opment of wind-generated electricity. It is difficult, indeed, to find popular wind turbines such as the Jacobs or the Wincharger models in California, although from the 1920s into the 1950s these two companies sold thousands of units in the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains states.4 California, however, can claim a unique wind turbine. At San Gorgonio Pass, east of Los Angeles, a tall, debonair real estate developer named Dew Oliver developed the first commercial wind gener ator, a ten-ton, seventy-foot, bell-shaped tube. In the early 1920s, Oliver had promoted real estate at Seal Beach, where, according to one resident, he could "talk a person out of the gold in his teeth."5 In spite of such supposed sales talent, Oliver's real estate ventures went sour. Never at a loss for an entrepre neurial gamble, a new idea captured his imagina tion. On a trip to the Midwest, he had observed a number of wind chargers at work, and upon return ing to California the idea took hold. He was apprais ing property in San Gorgonio Pass when it occurred to him that the wind resource might be more valu able than the barren land. A local Indian saying fur ther substantiated what was evident: "When the wind quits in the pass the end of the world will have come."6 Thus, with his on-site evidence backed by Indian wisdom, Oliver decided to build his unique, bell-shaped wind turbine called the "Oliver Electric Power Generator." The massive machine, which stretched seventy feet and was sometimes described as a giant blunderbuss, relied on a giant metal tube that sat on a circular track atop a concrete founda tion. When the wind shifted, the tube pivoted, tun neling the air and compressing it approximately twelve times. The compressed air spun a series of propellers mounted on a horizontal shaft within the tube. The propellers turned two generators, capable of producing two hundred horsepower.7 According to one account, the system performed satisfactorily. Much later, Sperry Knighton, Oliver's electrical engineer, claimed that "the idea worked. Only lack of money kept us from powering Palm This cutaway engraving shows the water-pumping Hal laday windmill, ca. 1870, which replaced earlier Dutch and English designs that had been used in America. Built with many additional, shorter blades, the Halladay mill drew water from depths of 150 feet, ten times that of its predecessors, which proved essential in the develop ment of the arid West.

According to more than one account, the initial gen erator, a relic from an old Seal Beach roller coaster, spun so fast that it soon burned up. The second installation, a more powerful generator from the Pacific Electric Streetcar Company of Los Angeles, proved more suitable for the load.9 With his first turbine generating, Oliver announced 144 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="4">Stocktom. tue city op WlWDMlLLS ABOOT \?95 ^m^m&gt;^: Today, sleek steel windmills stand like sentinels beside Altamont Pass, east of San Francisco Bay, yet they have all but vanished in nearby Stockton, once known as "the city of windmills."

Courtesy Haggin Museum. that his company intended to build a dozen or more similar tunnel system generators throughout a given electrical district. With that number of scattered units he assumed that at least one of the turbines would always be producing, providing electrical power for his customers. If, perchance, a general calm occurred, a bank of batteries would provide some storage capability.10 Simply put, Oliver planned to build the first wind electric farm, but a decentralized one that would be independent of other forms of energy production. The desert residents of Palm Springs never dis covered whether his idea would work, however. Financial troubles brought the venture crashing down not long after his first turbine began pro ducing. Convinced that enough capital was all he needed to assure his success, Oliver formed the Oliver Electric Power Corporation in Reno, Nevada, and capitalized it at $12.5 million. He sold stock in amounts of $50 to $10,000 in the boom market of the 1920s. Although investors responded generously, Oliver never paid much attention to securities laws, and in 1929 he faced eleven charges of grand theft under of the California State Corporate Securities Act. Brought to trial in April, he was found guilty by a Riverside County Superior Court jury on six counts. Judge F. A. Leonard sentenced him to three years in prison, but then commuted his imprison ment to three months on the condition "that Oliver abstain from liquor and stay out of places where it was sold."11 Whether Oliver honored the conditions of his commutation is unknown, but surely his career as a wind energy pioneer came to an end, as did the Oliver wind plant.12 To his credit, he was the first to recognize the potential of the San Gorgonio Pass SUMMER 1994 145</page><page sequence="5">area for wind generation and to provide seminal ideas regarding the concept of wind farms. But his more dubious legacy has to be his shady business dealings, which eventually resulted in his convic tion as a criminal. Oliver was a forerunner of the charlatans who in the early 1980s would use fed eral and California laws to put up shoddy wind machines. Like some contemporary promoters, Oliver apparently cared more for profits than per formance. Perhaps the failure of the Oliver "blunderbuss" illustrated that successful development of wind energy would require more than pure private enterprise. Positive incentives from the pub lic sector would have to be provided. Yet from 1930 to 1970 there was no interest in wind energy. It seemed a woefully inadequate method of power pro duction, especially with the advent of the fashion able nuclear plants. In the 1970s, however, a more critical assessment of the nation's energy needs and energy production profoundly affected California. By 1980 the business climate was advantageous and venture capital for wind generation flowed into the state. Between 1981 and 1990 some 15,000 wind generators were erected, mainly at three sites: San Gorgonio Pass, Tehachapi Pass between the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert, and Altamont Pass in the Coast Range between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. Today few Cali f ornians are unaware of this new phenomena on the landscape. Determining the reasons for this surge toward the development of renewable energy is surely specula tive. However, by the early 1970s, increasing num bers of Californians questioned whether being the biggest was necessarily the best and whether con tinued growth represented progress. Urban Califor nians were most concerned. Crowded, smog-filled cities overwhelmed the old "Garden of Eden" image of southern California, prompting historian/sociol ogist Lewis Mumford to ask the question: "If the places we live and work were really fit for human habitation, why should we spend so much of our ;] j*^'j|fSf|P|jp?i?iij'; :: On the desert landscape of San Gorgonio Pass, Dew Oliver built this giant "blunderbuss" in the late 1920s.

Meanwhile, in the 1970s, recurring oil and gasoline shortages created by polit ical turmoil in the Middle East sent fuel prices soar ing, touching off a search for cheaper, as well as less polluting, sources of energy. The election of Governor Jerry Brown (1975-1983) may be interpreted in different ways, but surely he represented the "green" interests. Once in office, Brown moved fast. He resurrected the California Energy Commission (CEC), and established the Office of Appropriate Technology, both focused on the increased use of renewable energy Legislation in 1978 known as the Mello Act (named after sponsor Representative Henry Mello) appropriated $800,000 to the CEC to accelerate wind-energy research. It passed in the same year that some fifteen million Americans participated in "Sun Day," a national cel ebration on May 3 calling attention to the potential of solar power. The Mello Act set various goals, including that by 1987 one percent of California's energy would be produced by wind generators, and that by the turn of the century the percentage would jump to ten.14 The CEC embarked on projects and issued contracts for numerous wind energy assessment projects. These studies pinpointed the best wind-energy locations. Later, Mike DeAngelis, a member of the Brown team, praised these reports, expressing his opinion that they were "one of the main reasons California has almost 90 percent of all wind development worldwide?it could have gone elsewhere in the United States but the data were just not there."15 SUMMER 1994 147</page><page sequence="7">i?lIllllIIlit? With the state's transformation from land of promise to landscape of compromise, the growing population and industrialization of California are evident in this view of the California aqueduct, wind generators and high tension transmission lines that crisscross the state, delivering water and electricity. Courtesy of the author. Of course, financial incentives were necessary to attract venture capital, especially in such an unknown, risky area as wind energy. Office of Appropriate Technology staffers, such as Ty Cashman, worked suc cessfully to see that, when a solar energy tax credit bill worked its way through the legislature, it included wind energy.16 When the bill became law in 1978, it stated that "wind energy for the production of elec tricity and mechanical work" would qualify for a twenty-five-percent tax credit.17 With federal tax credits of some twenty-five per cent already in place, investors were assured a first year return of fifty percent. An investor prospectus for WindMaster, Inc., a Belgian company, boasted that the investor of $100,000 in a limited partnership could recover $52,000 the first year, and almost $90,000 within five years, even though the investor's wind turbine might not produce a kilowatt of elec tricity.18 Such incentives attracted a large influx of capital, initiating what in 1983 Forbes magazine called "the fad of the year: the wind park tax shelter."19 Of course, in order to build wind farms, devel opers needed a market. Essentially, in the south, Southern California Edison (SCE) controlled the energy market, while in the north, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) dominated. The two companies dominated in both the production and the distribution of electrical energy. In the early 148 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="8">1970s both companies began campaigns to urge consumers to conserve, but executives were skepti cal and rigid regarding new methods of power pro duction. Historian Richard Hirsh described the smug, self-confident mood of the great northern Cal ifornia utility company: 'An industry giant, with about 10,000 MW of capacity in 1970, PG&amp;E entered the decade with old strategies intact. Expecting load growth to continue at its traditional rate of 6 to 7% annually, the company foresaw the need to construct five new nuclear power plants for use in the 1980s at a cost of about $13 billion."20 Yet by the close of the decade both companies had not only forsaken nuclear plants, but all large, capital-intensive power plants. This was a remarkable turnabout, and a full explanation is beyond the scope of this article. However, a few factors were evident. First, the planners were wrong in their load growth forecasts, underestimating the impact of energy conservation programs. Second, as is well known, because of the ecological disaster at the failed Three-Mile-Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and notorious chronic safety problems on many other reactors, the public became disenchanted with nuclear energy. Third, environmental groups questioned the utilities' notion that new nuclear, oil, or coal generating plants had to be built. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) led the charge, successfully questioning the growth projections of the PG&amp;E computer mod els, substituting their own "greenie" model.21 The EDF model was particularly unique, in that it demonstrated how PG&amp;E could profit by spending money on conservation projects and then adding that expense to the rate structure, allowing for a rea sonable return of about twelve percent. Making money by not producing energy was surely unique, and both PG&amp;E and SCE lawyers and planners at Travelers and commuters driving on Interstate 580 over Altamont Pass encounter an awesome expanse of wind turbines. As the state's second largest windfarm site, Altamont is a study in the evolving design of rotors and turbines. This string of early turbines may have inspired Sylvia White, professor of urban and regional plan ning, to dub the Altamont windmills "exoskeletal outer-space creations/' Courtesy of the author. SUMMER 1994 149</page><page sequence="9">first fought the idea, but by 1980, in the words of EDF lawyer David Roe, "PG&amp;E and [Southern Califor nia] Edison went back to their drawing boards and figured out how to meet all their electricity needs through the end of the 1980s without ordering a sin gle new monolith."22 Not only did the utility companies renounce huge new plants, but they became more flexible on the idea of purchase of energy from renewable or cogen eration sources. The companies would no longer insist upon a monopoly of energy production. In 1981 a writer for National Geographic found that PG&amp;E now viewed itself "more as energy-service specialists rather than simply power providers," and Southern California Edison acknowledged renewable energy as a "preferred technology."23 One is quick to add that the utility companies' aban donment of a previous monopoly was not without outside pressure. The California Public Utility Com mission moved decidedly toward a "soft energy path" and the views of EDF lawyers. The commis sion influenced the utility companies, and at one point imposed a hefty fine on PG&amp;E for dragging its feet on implementation of conservation plans.24 A 1978 federal law, however, proved most effec tual in forcing the utility companies to share in the task of energy production. The Public Utility Regu latory Policies Act (PURPA) represented a compli cated piece of legislation reflecting utility company concerns, and would have been forgettable except for Section 210, titled "Cogeneration and Small Power Production."25 Section 210, although "the most underlobbied, unsung piece of the National Energy Act," would change the nature of energy production in the United States.26 The section required that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prescribe rules for cogeneration and small energy power pro duction. Cogeneration referred to relatively small steam- or gas-turbine generators that could utilize discarded heat from processes such as paper-mak ing or petroleum-refining. "Small energy power pro duction" largely referred to solar sources of power (sun and wind) or hydro power. The unprecedented, indeed radical, nature of the new law could be found in the guidelines that required (not "suggested" or "encouraged") utility companies to purchase electric energy from these qualifying facilities (QFs) at the "avoided cost."27 The "avoided cost" comprised the "fixed and running costs" that a utility company could avoid by a purchase program. Generally, it is split into two divisions: 1) energy costs (fuel, oper ation, and maintenance) and 2) capacity costs (the capital costs involved in meeting "peak demand" periods). Determining the avoided cost rate is never easy, and is a matter of divergent opinion, compro mise, and a search for equity. The PURPA legislation worked a small revolution in American power production. First, the legislation encouraged penetration of the power-production monopoly of the utility companies. It signaled that utility executives must think of smaller means of production. Renewables, such as biomass, waste, water, solar, and wind, were all stipulated as "qual ifying facilities." Finally, it pledged that small pro ducers of electricity would be treated fairly both by utility companies and state public utility commis sions. For wind energy, the act swung wide the gates of opportunity.28 Thus a combination of environmental activism, energy conservation, political leadership, ample venture capital, and favorable state and federal leg islation all combined to provide a fertile field for wind energy development in California. The year 1981 was one of capital accumulation and deal making, with only 40 turbines installed. But the years to follow saw frenzied activity. In 1982,465 turbines were installed, and that number jumped geometri cally to 1,741 the following year. In 1984 the accel eration continued with 3,884 units erected, finally hitting the zenith of activity in 1985, when 4,529 new turbines faced the wind. At Altamont, Tehachapi, and San Gorgonio, construction workers installed some 10,661 wind generators with a total capacity of 1,126 mw, representing over ninety-six percent of wind energy capacity in the United States.29 Amer ican companies, such as Fayette Manufacturing Company, FloWind, and U. S. Windpower, put up the majority of the early turbines, but the business quickly acquired a global character. Germany, Bel gium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland, Japan, and the United Kingdom were all represented in some fashion. Unfamiliar companies, such as HMZ WindMaster (Belgium), Vestas (Denmark), Micon (Denmark), Bonus Energy (Denmark), Nordtank (Denmark), James Howden (United Kingdom), Wind Energy Group (United Kingdom), Stork FDO (Netherlands), and M.A.N. (Germany), brought their wind turbines to California and set up shop, hop ing to glean knowledge as well as profits from this new bonanza of opportunity.30 Like many early 150 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="10">* ' ^-JPSk ' - -.I /fci^^^r^lCx. ":/ilAv^=V =^y^-'|^BHKE\S^?PnapTp^e?^^P^^ai California bonanzas, however, this great boom was followed by a bust, initiated by the loss of federal and state tax credits and mechanical failure of many of the turbines. Nevertheless by 1989 construction began anew, and today almost 16,000 turbines feed power into the PG&amp;E and SCE state grid systems. How have Californians reacted to this quite remarkable accomplishment? It may be pre mature for meaningful judgments, but some observations may be in order. As a starting point, we might note the observation of Patrick Arguello, an employee at the Howden wind farm park at Alta mont. Arguello was astonished at environmental protests against the Altamont wind farms in the late 1980s, remarking that "wind energy used to be the darling of the environmental movement."31 Indeed it was, and many believed that wind energy offered the answer to the yearning for a benign method of producing energy. Once the machines were up and turning, the negative aspects of thousands of wind generators became evident. Most apparent to the millions of automobile travelers driving the interstate highways through Altamont and San Gorgonio passes was that many of the turbines did not work. Some wind farm parks seemed to be little more than a wreckage of broken blades, downed turbines and towers, and general technological chaos. The performance of Interna tional Dynergy's Cabez?n and Maeva wind farms at San Gorgonio offer a case in point. In 1985 at Cabez?n, less than one-half of the turbines were operative, and that figure slipped to less than twenty-five percent. At the Maeva site, the statistics were just as dismal, with the turbines producing only about twelve percent of the park's projected pro duction in late 1985. The result has been litigation and bankruptcy.32 The two parks also drew the attention of the internal Revenue Service, which took the reasonable position that if limited partner investors received huge tax credits, the wind tur bines should perform.33 Bill Adams, a reputable wind park developer, underscored the problem of reliability when he noted that "a lot of schlocks were getting into the business [in the early 1980s] and selling prototype SUMMER 1994 151</page><page sequence="11">machines on a mass basis that didn't work."34 Even the more reputable developers and manufacturers experienced difficulties, however. By late 1987, many of the Danish wind turbines' fiberglass blades devel oped structural problems, best described as fatigue cracks. In early 1988, Sea West Energy Company shut down 494 of their 870 units at San Gorgonio because of blade problems.35 Farther north, at Alta mont, unreliability haunted the industry. In late 1984, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted to deny new windmill permits until 557 bro ken down, unsightly wind turbines were removed.36 Machines in disrepair, shady companies, and unre liability seriously damaged the industry's reputa tion, resulting in loss of public faith. When the time for tax credit extension beyond 1985 came under dis cussion, even Congressman Pete Stark, representing the Altamont hills area, opposed continuation, remarking that "with what taxpayers are paying [for wind energy], we'd be better off hiring thousands of kids to sit on bicycles and pedal away to produce power for our toasters."37 Although the reliability question proved central, opponents of the wind farms attacked them on three environmental issues: 1) desecration of the rural landscape, 2) noise pollution, and 3) avian mortal ity. The most serious attack had to do with the land scape. Perhaps some of the most devastating criticism came from Sylvia White, a professor of urban and regional planning at California Poly technic University, Pomona. White felt the scenic Altamont hills had been destroyed by "exoskeletal outer-space creations." The turbines possessed gro tesquely anthropomorphic similarities, such as "long, sweeping blades attached to what ought to be their noses." "Their legs are frozen in concrete, stationary but seemingly kinetic." For White, the "once-friendly pastoral scenes now bristle with iron forests."38 Echoing White's sentiments, Mark Evanoff, director of "People For Open Space/Greenbelt Con gress," called for the "decommissioning" of the windmills. For Evanoff and his supporters, the wind turbines represented industrial culprits intruding on a pristine environment. "The greenbelt is not the place for light industry," stated Evanoff, referring to the Altamont wind farms.39 In the San Gorgonio/Palm Springs area, wind energy faced an opponent experienced in capturing the media spotlight. Sonny Bono, an entertainer who had achieved a certain fame as the one-time husband and singing partner of Cher Bono, became mayor of Palm Springs in 1988. Although not par ticularly articulate, like Mayor Clint Eastwood of Carmel, Bono could transform a local story into a national event. By June 1989, Bono was calling the turbines ugly and "a tax write-off for the owners." He announced that he would "fly to the nation's capitol... to do battle as Don Quixote did against windmills." The announcement proved more dra matic than the journey. Bono's group did meet with Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan, who, with diplomatic aplomb, assured the irate mayor that he would look into the situation.40 Bono certainly represented many residents. Since the wind turbines first appeared in 1981, residents had expressed reservations and often hostility to the intrusion. In 1985, Palm Springs mayor Frank Bogert felt comfortable in announcing that he did not "think tourism and industry go together, and all these windmills look like industry."41 On the other side of the coin, however, some residents feared the inva sion of Los Angeles smog more than the wind tur bines. An objective study by academic investigators Martin Pasqualetti and Edgar Butler indicated that the residents of Palm Springs were divided on the issue. Most residents opposed to the generators lived within two miles of the spinning turbines. They objected to the structures' noise and visual distur bance. However, the majority of residents were ambivalent, recognizing the value of a pollution-free energy source. Most significantly, the study ques tioned "the negative impression which one gleans from talking with local legislators and residents."42 Certainly division in Palm Springs still exists today, but a certain truce, indeed peace, has pre vailed since August 1990, the month in which Mayor Bono reversed his position. Perhaps listening to advocates like Clare Lees, who advised Sonny not to "pout because the windmills won't go away," but "use them to the city's advantage," Bono began to praise the wind turbines. Through annexation of the wind farms, he hoped to resolve the city's budgetary problems without resort to a resident property tax hike. In perhaps the ultimate irony, by late 1991 the neighboring town of Desert Hot Springs and Palm Springs were locked in a "turf war" to see which city could annex the most wind farm land.43 Noise pollution has affected primarily those peo ple who live close to the wind turbines. Some tur bines are very noisy, some are not. One couple, 152 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="12">Left: As mayor of Palm Springs, Sonny Bono expressed his dismay as wind turbines began to line the nearby countryside.

SUMMER 1994 153</page><page sequence="13">owners of a "ranchette" on the eastern side of the Altamont hills, protested so vigorously the "high pitched aerodynamic whizzing sound" and the thumping helicopter-type noise of the ESI (Energy Sciences, Incorporated) two-bladed downwind tur bine, that the company purchased their home and turned it into its headquarters.44 Darryl Mueller and John Soares represent two outraged home owners who live on Dyer Road on the west side of the Altamont hills. Mueller protested that the tur bines were "within three-quarters of a mile of my house and I can hear these windmills beating against my windows late at night." Soares agreed, stating that at night "sometimes it's [the noise] almost unbearable."45 Turbines are indeed disturbing, espe cially at night when the "whooshing" sound bounces off the atmosphere. One resident described the intru sion as "a pulsing beat... [like] a heartbeat magni fied through a powerful speaker system."46 Such a reminder of one's mortality could surely cause sleep lessness. In some areas wind turbines also take a toll on the bird population. Avian mortality has been largely limited to the Altamont Pass area, where red-tailed hawks and golden eagles soar on the updraft winds and hunt on the grass-covered hills. When installa tion commenced in 1981, developers expressed lit tle concern for the raptors. However, between November 1984 and April 1988, ninety-nine collision or electrocution incidents were reported to the Cal ifornia Energy Commission. A1989 CEC report indi cated that, with regard to bird electrocutions, "corrective measures have been successful where implemented." The collision problem has proved more difficult. From reports of "head, leg and body injuries ... including completely severed heads and bodies sheared in half," it was evident that the spin ning blades were doing the damage.47 The problem of bird deaths remained unresolved at Altamont, prompting David Nesmith of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the Sierra Club to comment that "whenever we think we've found the perfect envi ronmentally benign form of energy production we find that there's a problem. We're certainly sup portive of production of this nature [wind energy] as less destructive than fossil fuels and nuclear energy production, but the raptor damage certainly disturbs us."48 Not only did the bird-death problem at Altamont upset environmentalists, it proved a significant factor in defeating the Zond Systems proposal to develop a wind farm of 458 turbines at Tejon Pass. The reasons for the unanimous rejection by Los Angeles County Planning Commission were com plex, but surely a California Department of Fish and Game biologist's belief that the turbines would endanger California condor "flyways"?if the giant birds were reintroduced into the area?played a role. Russell Hemsath's testimony was even more telling. Representing the California State Racing Pigeon Association, Hemsath declared that if Zond had its way, "our birds would look like they went through a Cuisinart."49 A visual image of chopped up pigeons and raptor birds executed by Zond tur bines was difficult, indeed impossible, to counter. Two analysts agreed that the Tejon Pass wind farm defeat suggested that "the macro-scale benefits of wind energy [clean air, etc.]... seemed to make no impression and failed to counteract the micro-scale, local concerns of opponents." Local real estate and avian interests won the fight but incurred the wrath of environmental journalist Alston Chase, who cas tigated the local NIMBY ("Not in my backyard") reflex "dressed in the language of ecology." "The spirit of John Muir, Teddy Roosevelt and Rachel Car son," he charged, "is being co-opted by affluent practitioners of primitive chic more concerned with property values than with ?cologie sustainability."50 As Californians approach a new century, it seems safe to say that they remain ambiva lent with regard to wind energy. With the exception of the Montezuma Hills area, west of Rio Vista in the agriculturally rich Delta region, there have been few new turbines erected.51 Although engineers and maintenance people have largely solved the riddle of reliability (some farms now have a ninety-five percent availability rate), whether this infant industry will prosper is somewhat dependent on the large utility companies and the state Public Utility Commission. For the past ten years (1983 1993), wind energy companies have been paid about seven cents per kilowatt hour by PG&amp;E and South ern California Edison. However, the utility compa nies believe the "avoided cost" rate should be lowered in any new contract, arguing that the price of oil has dropped. A lower rate could drive many wind-generation companies out of business. How ever, overseeing all negotiations is the California Public Utility Commission, which in recent years has 154 CALIFORNIA HISTORY</page><page sequence="14">Wind generators and power lines at Altamont Pass. In some areas of the state, expansion of wind farms has been slowed or halted because of criticisms of the generators' unaesthetic appearance, noise, ground vibration, intrusion on grazing lands, and destruction of birdlife. Courtesy of the author. been sympathetic to renewable energy and may factor in the "social" or "hidden" costs involved with fossil fuels. With more reliable wind turbines, a sympathetic PUC view of "avoided costs," and the growing support of the public, this seminal experi ment in renewable energy should survive. Whatever the outcome, California has proved to be a pioneer. In so doing, it has not developed the perfect, benign way to produce electrical energy. Energy production, however, is not a question of finding the perfect source, but rather identifying and encouraging sustainable, reasonably benign energy sources. Wind energy has its faults, yet its gentle nature ought to assure its survival, provid ing electrical energy for the state and an example for the nation. EHI See notes beginning on page 174.
