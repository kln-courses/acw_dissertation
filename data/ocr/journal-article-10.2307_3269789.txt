<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Vedic Experience. Mantramafijari. An Anthology of the Vedas for Modern Man and Contemporary Celebration edited and translated with introductions and notes by Raimundo PANIKKAR - London, Darton, Longman &amp; Todd, 1977, XXXVIII and 937 pages. This collection of excerpts from the Vedic hymns and prose texts is intended to offer "at once an initiation into the primary sources and an invitation to personal reflection and meditation". As such it should "facilitate the meeting of East and West". The author, a Roman Catho- lic priest and professor of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wishes to convey more than mere infor- mation; "it could be that the message of these pages has trans- forming power" (p. 4). It is true, though sometimes forgotten, that considerable parts of the Veda are not only highly important religious and literary documents but also works of art and sources of inspi- ration and edification. Philologists, attempting to find in the often floating ideas of this literature complete and well-considered mytho- logical and theological systems have no doubt often missed the exalted fulfilment which contemplation could bring to the ancient practi- tioners. Therefore, an attempt at detecting the deeper meaning of the visions, beliefs and conceptions as they stood in the eyes of their protagonists and at making this meaning valuable and fruitful for modem men is no doubt legitimate. Provided however that the trans- lations of the original texts, the explanations and introductory sections of such a book are possibly reliable. It may be said that within the framework the compiler has given himself this is a good collection of on the whole tolerably reliable translations, sufficiently -explained and enthusiastically introduced. Generally speaking, the level of information is adjusted to the needs of those for whom the beautifully produced volume is intended. The author has succeeded in throwing light on the various commonly human, symbolical and psychological aspects of the Veda-of course as he views them-and that often in clear, not infrequently in some- what romantic and emotional wording. It should however be noticed that sections and arguments such as Numen, Vol. XXV, Fasc. 2</page><page sequence="2">190 Book reviews that on p. 725-730 are no interpretations of the original texts in the proper sense of the term but free elucidations of what in the author's opinion is their content, "meant to help us have the proper attitude of heart and mind as we approach the selected texts, which ... are simply companions on the road toward the final station of Man" (p. 795). Translations and commentaries are moreover not always in accordance with the newest philological interpretations. Thus the rendering of the Sdvitri (RV. 3, 62, io) "We meditate upon the glorious splendor of the Vivifier divine. May he himself illumine our minds !" should be replaced bij "We hope to obtain that desirable radiance of god Savitar, who is expected to stimulate (inspire) our visions !" Although many modern publications are mentioned in the notes, other recent books and articles have escaped the author's at- tention. Another drawback of the book is its organization which not only led the compiler to collect in the same chapter texts taken from various sources, but also necessitated reverting to the same deity or topic on different pages, the distribution of many explanations over several places and a considerable number of unpractical cross refe- rences. There are moreover several lapses in the rendering of tech- nical terms. The Aranyakas do not deal with the speculations and spirituality of forest dwellers who have renounced the world (p. 32), but contain material which was to be imparted to and studied by ad- vanced students in the solitude of the forest, because it was too secret and esoteric, too uncanny and dangerous to be communicated and studied in the villages. The explanations of the terms loka, s'anti and ahamrnkara (p. 405; 407; 881; 304; 535) are not wholly adequate; abhaya is "safety" rather than "fearlessness" (p. 298); the etymologi- cal explanations of rta and rtu (p. 350) are incorrect, those of yukta (p. 444), pataka (p. 458) etc. incomplete; dhaman does not mean "de- cree"; kratu not "will", daksa not "power" (p. 510); ayus is not "vital power" (p. 534), but "a complete lifetime". The characterization "Varuna is a Sky-God" (p. 506) is decidedly antiquated. The para- graphs on Indra (p. 199), Rudra (p. 284), Agni Vaisvanara (p. 330), the soma plant (p. 364) are too incomplete, that on ?ri (p. 315 f.) is incomplete and partly incorrect; that on Agni as one of the most anthropomorphic symbols (p. 327) can easily create misunderstanding. Some titles of hymns etc. (e.g. p. 635, n' 24; p. 637, n' 26) are too suggestive. Not all explanations of mythological figures will be sub- scribed to by the generality of Vedic scholars. Utrecht, J.
