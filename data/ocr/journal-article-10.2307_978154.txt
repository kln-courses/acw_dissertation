<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOUL OF SPAIN Few Americans had any insight into the critical part that Spain had played and still continues to play in the development of the modern world, through the fact that Spain endeavored to transpose the dying medieval culture into a modern key; witness Loyola's Society of Jesus.1 Spain gave to her colonies in the New World her language, religion, civic institutions, her system of education, her social customs, her chivalric sense of honor and her mystic fervor. Spain gave her body and soul to the New World.2 It is, therefore, in my humble opinion, of paramount importance to know the soul of Spain in order to comprehend and understand the Spanish American people. To that purpose--to better understand the spiritual and cultural background of Spanish America by studying the "'Soul" of Spain-this work is dedicated.-THE AUTHOR. At the close of the eighteenth century Nicholas Masson de Mor- villiers raised a hubbub in Europe by asking these two questions in the Encyclopedie Methodique: "Mais que doit-on a 1'Espagne? Et depuis deux siecles, depuis quatre, depuis six, qu'a-t-elle fait pour l'Europe?" At the end of a century of positivistic philosophy and at the beginning of the industrial era this was a very logical question. It is true that Spain did not invent the locomotive, the telegraph, the telephone nor the modern frigidaire; but in the realm of human and eternal values could a more idiotic question have been asked? The metaphysics of Suarez, the international law of Victoria, the great theologians of the Council of Trent, Cano and Soto, had no value whatsoever for this Positivistic century; nor did the fact that Spain had produced one of the most human and original theatres with Lope de Vega, Calder6n, Tirso de Molina and Alarc6n; the greatest novel in the modern sense of the word, Don Quijote; the most profound satirist of all Europe, Quevedo; the outstanding moralist of the seventeenth century, Lorenzo Graciain; and above all these a school of mystics in Saint Teresa of Avila, Saint John of the Cross, Fray Luis de Le6n and Juan de los Angeles, which has never been equaled. Even if Mr. Masson de Morvilliers could not see the importance of these contributions it is difficult to comprehend how he could ignore the transcendental fact that Spain had broken the columns of Hercules and had spread Mediterranean culture through the countries lying on the other side of the Atlantic and on the remotest shores of the Pacific. But this inability to understand Spain, to appreciate the great contributions she has made to the life of the spirit, does not rest solely with this Frenchman. Spain has been and continues to be a perpetual puzzle to all Europe. Why this enigma? 1 Lewis Mumford, New York Times Book Review. 2 Prof. Carlos Castillo. Antologia de la literatura mexicana (Chicago Univ. Press, 1944), p. 3. 263</page><page sequence="2">264 THE SOUL OF SPAIN Irving Babbitt says of the Spanish character: "There is some- thing enigmatical and peculiar in the makeup of the Spaniard "'du je ne sais quoi", as a Frenchman might express it. In trying to fathom Iberian ways of thought and feeling, we are frequently forced to fall back on the supposition of a recent writer, that "there is something Spanish in the Spaniard which causes him to behave in a Spanish manner." Some analyzers want to explain the puzzle of Spain by the strong Moorish and Oriental elements which combine so strongly with European traits in the Spanish soul. Some others go to the physi- ography of the land to express more or less the same idea. In no like area in Europe, perhaps not in the world, do there exist such extremes of dryness and moisture, heat and cold, fertility and bar- renness, such smiling landscapes and such dreary desolation. These contrasts we find between the arid steppes of Aragon and the huerta of Valencia, between the bleak uplands of Castile and the palm groves of Elche, between the wind-blown wastes of the Mancha and the vega of Granada, are not without counterpart in the char- acter of the inhabitants. Mr. Ford, perhaps the most quoted foreigner, describes it as fol- lows: "A singular country which hovers between Europe and Africa, between civilization and barbarism; that land of the green valley and the barren mountains, of the boundless plain and broken sierra, those Elysian gardens of the vine, the olive, the orange and the aloe; those tractless, vast, silent, uncultivated wastes, the heritage of the wild bee . . . that original, unchanged country where indulgence and luxury contend with privation and poverty, where a want of all that is generous or merciful is blended with the most devoted heroic virtues, where ignorance and erudition stand in violent con- trast." I could continue quoting endlessly from hundreds of for- eign writers, always expressing the same enigma, the same puzzle, the same misunderstanding, because the Spaniard or Spain is defi- nitely an enigma to secular civilization and to the positivistic phil- osophy which reigns and dominates all powerful today in the school and the university, in the academies and literary centers, not to speak of modern superficial journalism. In this essay I shall endeavor to explain the fundamental char- acteristics of Spain, as much as it is possible. In the first place, we have to admit that the most characteristic quality of any country, of any human being, is his soul (though few believe in the soul to- day, and right here is the first enigma); but undoubtedly Spain has</page><page sequence="3">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 265 a soul and the soul of Spain is mystic, fundamentally mystic. Some Spaniards, like Ganivet, have emphasized stoicism as a peculiar trait of the Spanish character. Stoicism, in its practical and broadest sense is perhaps to be found in the Spanish soul but stoicism in its philosophical and restricted meaning is not one of the peculiarities of the Spaniard. For the Spaniard, what is mysticism? Does he live the truly mystic life? Mysticism In Spain As the theologians have wisely observed, to merit the name mystic it is not enough to be a devout Christian, a great theologian, nor even a saint. It requires in addition a special psychological state, a fervour of the will and of the thought, a profound and persistent contempla- tion of divine things, and a system of metaphysics which is totally different from, although not contrary to, dogmatic theology. The mystic, if he is orthodox, accepts theology and considers it as the basis of all his speculations but he advances far beyond this: he as- pires to the possession of God through the union of love, and pro- ceeds as if God and his soul were alone in the world. Mysticism is a state of the soul. So powerful and fruitful is its virtue that from it are born: a mystic theology; a mystic ontology, in which the spirit, enlightened by the flame of love, glimpses the perfections and attributes of the Supreme Being (pure reasoning can not reach this elevation); a mystic psychology which discovers and eradicates even the slightest traces of self-love and human affec- tions; and a mystic poetry which is no more than the interpretation, in the form of art, of all these theologies and philosophies animated by the personal and intense feeling of the poet who sings of his love. Only in Christianity can pure and perfect mysticism live; but it is possible to meet it in a less pure state in every belief that affirms and recognizes the distinction between the human personality and the divine personality. It can not be the fruit of vague deism, nor of fragmentary and anthropomorphic polytheism. For this reason the Greeks never attained a semblance nor a glimmer of it. Where men are valued more than gods, who is going to aspire to ecstatic union, or to efface himself in the sweetness of contemplation? The superiority of Hellenic art consisted in seeing the form everywhere, that is, the finite. The superiority of mysticism consists in giving us a divine consciousness of the infinite, even when it appears en- veloped in terrestial forms and allegories. In the field of Christianity with which we are concerned now,</page><page sequence="4">266 THE SOUL OF SPAIN mysticism has its foundation in the firm belief that God, and only God, can fulfill the infinite longings of the human heart. It is this deep religious belief that characterized and dominated the spirit of Spain completely the moment she adopted Christianity. But why did Catholicism take such roots in Spain? Is it because her soil was better prepared to receive it than any other nation's? These are questions that deserve mature examination and thought before they can be answered satisfactorily. Ganivet It is the belief of Ganivet, one of the most subtle analyzers of the Spanish soul, that the most profound moral, and, to a certain extent, religious element that is found in the psychological consti- tution of Spain is stoicism; not the brutish and heroic stoicism of Cato, nor the serene and majestic stoicism of Marcus Aurelius, nor the rigid and extreme stoicism of Epictetus, but rather the natural and human stoicism of Seneca. Seneca is not a Spaniard, nor a son of Spain, by chance: he is Spanish per essentiam-continues Ganivet. He condenses the whole doctrine of Seneca in this teaching: Do not let yourself be conquered by anything outside of your spirit. Think in the midst of life's accidents that you have within you a mother- force, something strong and indestructible, like an adamantine axis around which revolve the petty acts that form the drama of your daily life. Whatever may be the circumstances that overtake you, prosperous or adverse, or those which appear to debase us with their very contact, conduct yourself at all times so firm and erect that at least it may always be said of you that you are a man. This is Spanish, says Ganivet, and it is so Spanish that Seneca did not have to invent it because he found it already invented; he merely had to take up and give it perpetual form, working as true men of genius work. The Spanish spirit, unformed, unpolished, bare, does not cover its primitive nakedness with artificial garments; it covers itself with the mantle of Senecism; and this rudimentary covering remains always, and can be seen whenever one penetrates ever so slightly the surface or out- ward appearance of our nation. Vast, or rather immeasurable, is the influence of Senecism on the religious and moral conformation, and even on the common law of Spain; on art and profane science; on the proverbs, maxims and re- frains; and even on those branches of cultivated science to which Seneca never paid any attention. And because our philosopher had the genial and never-sufficiently-praised idea of saying goodbye to this life by the gently and tranquil method of blood-letting, he has influenced our medical science as much as Hippocrates or Galen. Spain alone exceeds all</page><page sequence="5">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 267 other nations together in the number and superiority of her blood-letters. The famous German doctor is Doctor Faust; the famous Spanish doctor is Doctor Sangredo (Blood-Letter). And never in the history of humanity was so beautiful an example of persevering stoicism given as the one which offers us the interminable series of blood-letters, who, for cen- turies and centuries have charged themselves with alleviating the circu- latory apparatus of the Spaniards, sending many to the grave it is true, but purging the rest from their sanguine excesses to the end that they could continue to live in relative peace and calm . Unfortunately we can not agree with this opinion of Ganivet. Nobody who has thoroughly read and understood the complete work of Seneca can hold such an opinion. Seneca Was Seneca a genuinely Spanish product? Did he belong to the two races that most profoundly have determined Spanish character -the Celtic and the Iberian? History tells us that the Turdetanos inhabited Betica in the time of the Empire, and that their capital, Cordoba, the birthplace of Seneca, shone with brilliant geniuses; but history does not show us, either scientifically or sociologically, that these inhabitants of the south can be identified with either the Iberians or the Celts. The supposition that the Turdetanos have left some traces in the Andalusian character is scarcely tenable since in Andalusia, the Vandals, and later the Arabs swept away what remained of Roman influence. Seneca was a thoroughly Roman product. In the age in which he lived, the Epicureanism of the early part of the Empire had been replaced by the philosophy of the Porticus. Roman independence and liberty had disappeared. Caesar, incarnating Destiny, was sitting on the throne of the world like an earthly representative of omnipotent Fate--of the great cosmic unity. True wisdom consisted in conquering and overcoming adversity and the annoyances of life, with silent imperturbability. The only compensation for the man who lost his political power, or was thrown into exile, consisted in seeking retirement and in ac- cepting it with resignation and an inner serenity which no one could give him, nor any power take away. However, it is not at all a fact that Seneca practiced, or even preached constantly, this doctrine of the dignity of man, or that he himself was a model of rectitude or of greatness of mind. A close examination of his doctrines reveals a series of contradictions which utterly disprove the assertions of Ganivet; and at the same time shows that Seneca hardly embodied in any way the Spanish spirit which, once it has embraced an idea,</page><page sequence="6">268 THE SOUL OF SPAIN unhesitatingly and persistently carries it through to its final con- sequences. Influenced by the education of his day, Seneca in everything he undertook aspired to a kind of unattainable eclecticism which com- bined all schools and systems: "Always read," he said to Lucilius, "the approved authors; and if after having amused yourself with others, it pleases you to return to the first, when you have glanced through the many, select for that day only one in order that you may digest it. I, myself, do this also; from among many I take one. I am also accustomed at times to go to foreign fields, not as a fugi- tive, but as an explorer." (Ad Lucilium, Ep. IIa). But this explora- tion frequently carried Seneca far from the limit fixed by him; and although, when speaking to Lucilius he showed himself such a devotee of Epicurus, later on he found himself very near to the school of Zeno whose doctriness he followed for a long time. He never really ceased admiring the speculation of Socrates' pupil. Finally, tired of all systems because none succeeded in satisfying him (for it was impossible that the truth that he sought should emerge from all of them), he decided to seek the truth by depending entirely on his own powers. He then explains to Lucilius: "He who follows another follows nothing, or rather seeks nothing. What then ... Shall I not follow the footsteps of the best? I will follow the ancient path; but if I find another cleaner and smoother, I shall follow it. Those who knew them before us are not our masters, but our guides. Truth is patent to all, but as yet it has not been possessed by any. Much remains for future generations." (Ad Lucilium, Ep. XXXIII). Such then are the principles upon which Seneca intends to re- construct his studies. Nevertheless, the very liberty that he pro- fesses is not sufficient to free him from the contradictions which are discovered in all his books. If he counsels as a politician, we shall see him deny tomorrow what he affirms today, even in questions of utmost importance to the State. If he reasons on morals, he ap- proves today what he disparages tomorrow. In his treatise, De Cle- mentia, he succeeds in persuading Nero, with the example of Au- gustus, not only to pardon the injuries that were done to him as a man, but also those that were directed against him as a sovereign (De Clementia, lib. I, ch. 9). But fearing perhaps that excessive clemency would cause contempt by permitting the crimes of the common people to remain unpunished, and thus supply a motive for a rebellion, he says farther on: "But the lower class must not</page><page sequence="7">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 269 be pardoned because where discord arises between the good and the bad, confusion and a flood of vices follow. It becomes necessary then to employ that moderation which knows how to distinguish those that can be corrected and those that are already incurable. It is not fitting to use a common form of clemency for everybody, be- cause it is just as cruel to pardon all as it is to pardon none." (De Clementia, lib. I, ch. 2). Then, swinging finally to the opposite extreme, he advises that one destroy his enemies: "Are not kings wont to kill also? Yes, certainly; but whenever they do, public utility advises it." (De Clementia, lib. I, ch. 12). Here we have the man of State contradicting himself. And Nero, setting aside as useless the early counsels of the moralist, showed by his conduct that he was not in the habit of forgetting the precepts of the poli- tician. Further Contradictions of Seneca In many other questions of equal consequence did Seneca contra- dict himself. Questioning the civic virtues of the Romans which, on other occasions, he had so highly praised, he asserted that, to ob- tain the honors and distinctions of the State, it was enough simply to have been born of an illustrious father. "Who made Cicero's son consul except his father?" exlaims Seneca. ". . . and recently, what brought Cinna to the Consulate from the ranks of the enemy? ... What brought Sextus Pompey and the other Pompey's except the greatness of one single member of the family?" (De Beneficiis, lib. IV, ch. 22). Equal inconsistency did our philosopher show in discussing the subject of benefits. He had maintained and repeated in various passages that indiscriminate kindness was appreciated by nobody: "Beneficium quod quibuslibet datur, nulli gratum est." He made it plain that deliberate thought and a certain selection ought to precede the bestowal of any favor. But later he repented of this maxim for he said on sketching the model of a truly ideal man that he should be one: "qui non voluntatem tantum juvandi habuit, sed cupiditatem." In still another place he added: "Etiam si quid morae intervenit, evitemus omnimodo, ne deliberasse videamur." (Ibid., lib., II, ch. 1). Here again it is clearly evident that Seneca is refuting in an absolutely convincing manner a doctrine he previ- ously upheld. It would be tedious to continue noting here all the contradictions in which the master of Nero abounds. He who wishes to find out in more detail may read Alonzo Niiiez de Castro's book published in 1651, Seneca impugnado de Seneca, en cuestiones</page><page sequence="8">270 THE SOUL OF SPAIN politicas y morales. In conclusion, we shall simply say that when Seneca writes of friendship or hate, of love or ingratitude, or resigna- tion, constancy, tranquility of mind, meekness, grandeur, vanity, pride or avarice, we always see him confronted with implacable doubts and irresolutions. Seneca Is Not a Typical Spaniard How can it be said that a spirit so vacillating, so contradictory, and in so many instances so faint hearted and indecisive, was a product and is a true representative of the Spanish type? What is there in common between Seneca the Eclectic, the Sybarite, the play- thing of all currents and ideas, and the Iberian race, full of energy and powerful vitality, of an unquenchable instinct for personality, with an insatiable need of believing firmly in and consecrating itself to its ideals, heroic, fervent, obdurate, with something of a gloomy contemplation, and, hiding underneath burning passions and the impetuosity of a blood heated by an African sun? We have lin- gered long on this subject and for a very good reason, because ever since Ganivet asserted that Seneca embodies the true Spanish spirit, it has been repeated to the point of satiety. His idea might have originated from reading Seneca in one of those manuals of Moral Philosophy and Politics which several learned Spaniards and foreign- ers have compiled of his most popular works, without having taken the trouble to read carefully all his works and compare them with one another. Blood-Letting in Spain In respect to that other strange assertion that, because Seneca met death by opening his veins, he influenced the multitude of blood- letters which existed in Spain in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies-those so humorously described in the picaresque novel-we can only say if one takes it as a bit of humor we will acknowl- edge that it is ingenious, but it can in no way be taken seriously. If that example had really influenced the Spanish people, we should have had in our literature and in our real life a multitude of suicides. These would prove in an irrefutable manner the true stoic spirit em- bodied in Seneca. But in Spain where are the suicides? Menendez y Pelayo in his study of Martinez de Toledo asks if there is anything more improbable than the suicide of a Spaniard during the Golden Centuries of Spain's history. Whoever thought of suicide in those days? Of the great number of victims who were punished by the Inquisition or by royal authority, how many tried to escape the</page><page sequence="9">DAVID RUBIo, O.S.A. 271 gallows with poison or blade? Only someone condemned as a heretic, like Doctor Constantino, and he horrified even his co-religionists. Even in Spanish literature of these times suicides are almost as rare as in real life in spite of the fact that poets have always used this easy device to unravel bad plots. Outside of the death of Melibea in the tragi-comedy of La Celestina, the other suicides that I recall in our classicss are attributed to historic persons of antiquity, to bar- barian, pagan heroes or sentimental enamored shepherds of the pas- toral novel who lived an unreal existence. Christianity Not a Logical Philosophical Evolution The moment Christianity was introduced into Spain it rooted itself so firmly there that it was soon the essential element of the na- tional character. From it sprang all the great manifestations of the spirit of the race. This phenomenon has been diversely interpreted. Some see in it a kind of natural consequence and logical evolution of the stoicism embodied by Seneca. This opinion they base on the belief that Christianity was an evolution of the Jewish doctrine for which stoicism had carefully prepared the way. Was Christianity an evolution of any existing philosophy? In the world of Rome all philosophical solutions were exhausted: the empirical and the con- structive; the materialistic and the idealistic; the eclectic and the synthetic; as well as the negative and the sceptical. Then arose stoic morality based solely on virtue or the dignity of man which, accord- ing to some prepared the way for Christianity because man, losing faith in the power of his reason, which led him to nothing positive, closed his eyes and was ready to accept any belief. But Christianity, or rather the doctrine of Jesus, opened men's eyes wide with such divine teachings as the Sermon on the Mount. Of course Christi- anity has a natural basis, and revelation (that light from on high) did not destroy but rather purified human nature; but that does not mean that it was inspired or that it evolved from the theories of the different philosophical schools. Whether the pagan world was more or less prepared to receive the divine message of Jesus is not a thing which we ought to discuss now. Probably it was; although the degeneration into which it had fallen was not very propitious for germinating an elevated doctrine of any kind. Even Renan, with all his artfulness and astonishing erudition, was unable to prove that Jesus received his teachings from any philosophical school. If Christian morality had simply been the more or less natural</page><page sequence="10">272 THE SOUL OF SPAIN evolution of the human spirit, it would have had the value of another new school of philosophy. And with the passing of time it, too, would have gone out of fashion as did the solutions propounded by the most sublime minds of humanity, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, But, thank God, the morality of the Divine Nazarene is of yester- day and today and of all times; and not only has it regenerated the pagan world, but it has also created the little that we have of modern civilization. If we have not progressed further it is because there are not very many souls in the world who practice it. Nor was Chris- tianity the completion of the theological evolution of the Hebrew people. To that law which had served during many centuries to maintain in the world the light of revelation it brought something new-the regeneration of men by a new conception of love which Christ taught to the world. Neither do I agree with the historians who assert that the invasion of the barbarians helped in large meas- ure the propagation of Christianity, declaring that the Roman people were old and decrepit and incapable of understanding this new re- ligion. The truth is to the contrary. The Christian religion was not destined merely to draw the savage from his savagery, nor the bar- barians from their barbarism. It did much more. It served to re- generate cultured men, degenerate to be sure, but civilized. The Romans, those in Italy as well as those of the provinces, let them- selves be influenced by the doctrines of the Nazarene as had the barbarians of the North. Conciliation of Christianity and Pagan Philosophy The spreading of the Christian religion was accompanied by a remarkable phenomenon: the grafting of pagan philosophy onto Christianity in an effort to conciliate rational speculation with re- vealed truth. In this important undertaking almost all the fathers of the church took part. This development was quite natural since almost all of them, especially those of the first centuries, were a product of the Greco-Roman culture. In those countries permeated with the idea of Christianity, ra- tional effort accompanies the propagation of the gospel to explain and complete it; but that effort was not as creative in the beginning as it should have been. It was a work of rhapsodists. Instead of working out an empirical and rational philosophy in conformity with the purity of the new faith, these Christian philosophers, heirs of the Gentile knowledge, found it more convincing and practical to make Christianity agree with the masterly teachings of the Hel-</page><page sequence="11">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 273 lenic school; that is to say, with all the Platonic and Aristotelian speculation that was not openly opposed to the principles of faith. In Spain, Pure Christianity Not Conciliation The Spanish character, which draws the ultimate consequences from any principles that it embraces, when it received the evangelical doctrine did not try to make conciliations of any kind, but rather adopted it in all its integrity and purity and gave itself over to it without distinctions or reserve. It can be stated as a fundamental truth in discussing Spanish culture that neither creative philosophy, in the time sense of the word, nor heresies exist, that are worth men- tioning. Menendez y Pelayo, in spite of his most objective study, was unable to find any heretic of any proportion in his History of Spanish Heterodoxy. Is this not a logical consequence since the Christian idea mixed with Greco-Latin philosophy had not been introduced into Spain? This does not mean that the Spanish spirit lacks capacity for philo- sophical speculation. It means that philosophy, whose foundation is reason, had been for centuries and centuries incapable of solving the problems of life and death and now that Christianity had amply solved these problems of what avail was further speculation of rea- son which had failed? I believe that this logic, which may seem ex- treme to some, has colossal force. If we examine closely the so-called Christian philosophy, the first thing that is not in accord with the significance and content is its name. That philosophy, strictly speak- ing, should be called Christianized. Christianity has not created any philosophy, nor has it reason to. The Gospels contain the most sub- lime philosophy and they are not the work of any Christian philos- opher, but the Son of God. The great Christian philosopher is St. Thomas who has done nothing else, say what one may, except Christianize Aristotle, correcting the errors found in the Stagirite's works, not only by rational speculation but also by the light of faith and the teachings of the Scriptures. Bulwark of the Faith In Spain then, different from other nations, Christianity entered unpolluted by any pagan philosophy; notwithstanding the asser- tion of those who say that Senecism had prepared the way. As we have already seen, Seneca was an exclusively Roman product. His real influence in Spain dates from a later period, long after the Cath- olic idea had deeply rooted itself in the Spanish mind. And what is the essential idea of Christianity? In my opinion, the one main un-</page><page sequence="12">274 THE SOUL OF SPAIN derlying idea is that the Kingdom of Christ and therefore of the Christian, is not of this world. If His Kingdom is not on earth it must be in Heaven; that is to say, in God with all His glory and majesty. Of what value is life itself and all the contentions of the soul, even the conquest of the whole universe, if the Kingdom of God is lost? But this Kingdom of Christ also exists in this world, although it is simply a kind of initial Kingdom, a prologue of the eternal one-the Church. With the triumph of the Catholic religion man may conquer and possess the Kingdom of God. For the realiza- tion of this triumph all the great political, as well as literary and phil- osophical manifestations of the Spanish spirit, strive with an extraor- dinary vigor and strength. They are animated, without any excep- tion, by this very fundamental idea. It is not strange then that Spain, the moment she embraces Ca- tholicism, adheres to its every precept with all the tenacity inborn in the race. And when the enemy of her religion invades her land she sheds her blood in torrents not so much to reconquer her native land as to protect her Catholic soil from being tread by infidels. By defending her faith she defends herself. Her faith alone will be her most powerful ally in recovering her fatherland. For this reason we can not separate this predominating religious idea of the Spaniard and the feeling of nationality. Her every effort was directed toward the expansion of this religious ideal which penetrated deeply into the hearts of her people who dedicated perpetual allegiance to it. Thus is religion so important in the life and soul of all the people that it becomes the most characteristic trait that distinguishes them. It is the foundation or instrument of their nationality, and it is almost the only source, certainly the most productive, of all their intellectual activity. This spirit is present in every action, however, small, however great, of the Spaniard. Indeed, St. Teresa remarked, "God walks even among the pots and pans." The Mystic Flame Is it strange then, that in the soul of such a race there should exist such a powerful tendency toward mysticism? In no other Christian nation has it penetrated so deeply into the hearts or so profoundly shaped literature. Mysticism does not appear in Spain in the form of a poem, as in Italy; nor in the form of theology, as in France; nor does it show itself in revolutionary experiments, panthe- istic and biblical dreams, as in England, Germany or Switzerland. The action of Spanish mysticism is infinitely more extensive because</page><page sequence="13">DAVID RuBIO, O.S.A. 275 it has never confined itself to any school. It penetrated every corner of life and left nothing untouched. It not only influenced the in- telligence but also the customs of the people. It is the most char- acteristic trait of Spanish genius. We find mysticism in the lecture hall and the cloister, in literature, the arts, and in philosophy. El Greco's figures are consumed by a mystic flame. This is the true philosophy of Spain and the most profound element of her religion. This flame of mysticism brought about the reform of the Spanish church. In those nations in which the philosophical spirit manifested it- self most powerfully, as in Greece, France, Italy and Germany, mys- ticism, although it had some manifestations worthy of note, had no special character as in Spain. It did not in any way mold the char- acter of those nations, nor was it a characteristic note of their re- ligion or their thought. Ticknor says, "No sooner Christian, than Spain is mystic. Mysti- cism appears in her not in a few isolated individuals, but in the entire nation, even to the extent of having it said that it is a 'fruit of the soil'." The Development of Mysticism The reason for the strengthening of this mystic vein is more evi- dent if one adds to this original predisposition of the Spaniard toward mysticism the political and religious vicissitudes which have swept over Spain since the invasion of the Goths; and that other invasion of a more determinative and decisive character, the Arabic invasion. Mysticism bloomed in full flower in the sixteenth century but it has never been absent from the Spanish soul from the moment Chris- tianity was first preached there. It neither begins nor ends with St. Teresa but in her it reached the height of expression as it did also in Saint John of the Cross. The past had matured these fruits which in their full fragrance were transmitted to future generations. Thus is formed the most perfect portrait of this dominant religious idea, which, as we have explained, was not only a consequence of native tendencies but also the result of the refusal on the part of the Span- iard to try to harmonize the Christian doctrine with the Greco- Roman philosophy. At the time of the conversion of the Visigoths under Recaredo, a conversion which clearly shows the predominance of the Hispo- Roman spirit over the Gothic, the clergy was solemnly recognized as a great power even in state affairs because of its greater culture and civilization. So quickly did its prestige increase that soon it became</page><page sequence="14">276 THE SOUL OF SPAIN the true ruling force of the state. From its great spiritual force came the prerogative of disposing of the King's crown in that elective monarchy. Thus the King reigned and governed only by virtue of the protection accorded him by the church. Right here we have per- haps the first proof of the influence of spiritual values even in civil government which has persisted in Spanish history to the present time. The Councils of Toledo are an eternal monument of the wise influence that the clergy exercised over the Gothic people and the Visigothic monarchy became the most cultured and Christian of Europe for almost two centuries. When this institution disappeared with the invasion of the Arabians, the clergy, representatives of the Christian idea, continued to exercise an influence still more decisive. Into the hearts of the conquered Goths they inculcated the redeeming idea of nationality, the firmest foundation of which was religion. This became the supreme interest that determined and fixed the most es- sential trait of the Spanish people throughout the centuries. It united the whole peninsula against the common enemy of her faith. This struggle of eight centuries has been traced by eminent historians. It does not enter into our purpose to follow it in all its details and vicissitudes. Suffice it to say that when a people in whom faith has imbedded deep roots fall under the dominion of a master who is at the same time a foreigner and an infidel, the religious sentiment will become the root of the national spirit. Thus for the Christians of Spain to resist the Moors was equivalent not only to reconquering the soil of their native land, but also to maintaining their faith and fighting for their beliefs. Never was the struggle more national and at the same time more likely to promote a closer adherence to Ca- tholicism. And although with the passing of time the bitterness of the hatred between Arabians and Christians was somewhat modi- fied, this was in reality only a truce. Spanish martyrology gives abundant proof of how short lived and limited it was. The normal state of affairs was resistance and conflict in all forms. Throughout the whole of Spain there awoke a desire for martyrdom, for sacri- ficing everything precious in life, even life itself, not merely to de- fend the native land, but principally to make triumphant the Chris- tian idea, the very important idea that the Kingdom of the Christian is not of this world. From here on, the unification of such varied elements as make up the Iberian peninsula does not seem strange nor surprising. The deep instinct of individuality which characterizes the Iberian race</page><page sequence="15">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 277 would have resisted all unification if it had not been for this religious idea, the deepest, the most essential in the constitution of the Spanish race. As St. Hilary says, nothing is more varied than the different parts of the Peninsula; products, climate, tastes, aptitudes, charac- teristics divergent to a high degree: diverse opinions, striking con- trasts. Nothing seems worse to the grave and indolent Castilian than the loquacious and swaggering Andalusian. Under the same physical condition of position and climate, we see the industrious -Catalan seeking his fortune in all corners of the world, while the Valencian, sedentary and distrustful, cultivates in his rich garden spot the same patch in which his fathers plowed. We see the laborious son of Ga- licia, who from one end of Spain to the other hires his robust shoulders to whomever will pay for them. Next to the calm and noble Arago- nese moves the lively Basque, proud of his judiciary powers, as is also the Aragonese of his municipal liberties. In all, or in almost all the provinces of the Peninsula, one notes a great variety of tendencies, with no inclination toward unity as we find in France, around a national and powerful royalty. What force then was able to combine and harmonize such di- verse elements and produce Spanish unity of purpose? It was the force of religious feeling in its highest and most ideal expression that crystallized these elements in such a way that political unity was in reality merely a religious unity. The real creator of Spanish spirit was this religious idea, and later the mystic idea. We must not forget that this principle of nationality, so real and effective today, is of relatively modern origin. In the Middle Ages it scarcely existed. But in the Spanish race it revealed itself more lively and powerful, perhaps, than in any other European nation; or at least sooner, since the invader of the Peninsula, instead of being Christian, as was the invader of Italy for example, was infidel and therefore considered an enemy of the Catholic religion. From where does one deduce that the unity of the Spanish race obeyed an idea absolutely diverse from that of other nations, such as France or Italy? Outside of Spain no- where has religion played such a preponderant role because nowhere else has it been so fully identified with the national character. Thus are explained later the wars against the Protestant countries, so mis- understood and misinterpreted by the historians who notice only the external facts without taking into account the spirit of the race and its predominant ideas. With the taking of Granada and the close of the war of the Re- conquest, that spirit of unification was intensified in a most deci-</page><page sequence="16">278 THE SOUL OF SPAIN sive manner. The Spanish people are now animated with the desire to make Christianity triumphant in all Europe. Columbus carried the Cross as his insignia to be planted on the American shore; Charles V exerted himself to the utmost to have the Council of Trent con- vene to reform the ecclesiastical customs. John of Austria carried the Cross that Pope Pius V had given him to overcome the Turks and thus gain dominion for Christianity; and Philip II may be said to have ruined himself and all Spain with him, not to realize a dream of world power as it is commonly affirmed, but to establish the tri- umph of Catholicism. For this he sacrified himself and his nation. All Europe allied itself against this ideal and the result was not hard to predict. When the Spanish army began to witness defeat, it was religion and mysticism that saved Spain from falling into vulgar commercialism and worshipping the Golden Calf. At this very moment Spanish theologians reached the most profound of the re- ligious problems. With supreme mastery they dealt with the mooted questions of divine science, of predestination and of free will, which touch the very roots of Christianity; of the nature and life of men and of the essence of God in His relations with His creatures. That titanic struggle, which viewed superficially may seem to some a ques- tion of no importance, is the clearest proof that the great question that preoccupied the Spaniard was the religious problem, and this over any other economic or political problem whatsoever. From all this, mysticism was born. To be sure, other predecessors of Spanish mysticism may be found, such as Saint Francis, Dante, Giacomino de Verona, Jacopone da Todi and St. Bonaventure in Italy; Hugo and Richard of St. Victor in France; Tauler, Ruys- broeck and Eckhardt in Germany; Raymund Lull in Spain; and especially in the early days of Christianity, the Holy Fathers. Of great importance among the latter is Dionysius the Areopagite, the author of the fifth century to whom are attributed the works, Mys- tical Theology, Divine Names, Celestial Hierarchy containing much neoplatonism and even something of pantheism. However, their influence on the Spanish mystics was neither deep nor direct. In fact, Spanish mysticism is openly opposed to many of their tenden- cies. During the Renaissance the spirit of Christianity suffered an at- tack from two forces which tried to corrupt it. One was Hellenism and the other Rationalism. The Hellenic spirit attacked Christian spirituality, exalting matter over spirit, the enjoyments of the flesh over purity of the soul, injecting, moreover, the Platonic idea of an</page><page sequence="17">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 279 abstract and impersonal God. But this idea had already been anathematized by St. Paul and the Church Fathers who proved the supreme value of the spirit, which is immortal and which never ought to let itself be dominated by the passions of the body. The rationalistic tendency wished man to return to ancient individualism, which makes the human being a kind of egocentrism, that is to say, that man may form his own individual religion without participat- ing in any way in group religion, each one founding for himself and by himself his own church, a principle that has led to religious an- archy. The Spanish soul, profoundly Catholic, resisted these ten- dencies, declaring itself sincerely obedient to the Church and spir- itualizing the art of the Renaissance which threatened to make him return to the most crude Paganism. Again, Spanish mysticism was not dissolved in the pure abstractions of the Hellenism of the Areop- agite, as was the German mysticism of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, nor did it become individualistic by separating itself from the communion of the faithful and of the Church. Spanish mysti- cism is above all an obedient child of the Church, subjecting all its acts to the decision of Authority. If it labors to unite itself with God it is by means of good works and by conquering the world and the passions of the flesh. Spanish mysticism neither loses itself in vague abstractions nor does it live in isolation. Contemplation, the necessary medium for the union with God, is always mixed with much activity, and one of its most notable characteristics is that of self-sacrifice for one's neighbor. This is the true spirit of Christi- anity, the true spirit of the Gospel. It bloomed pure in Spain because it was not vitiated by the conciliation of Christianity and Pagan philosophy. Following the doctrines of the Brahmans, Buddists, Neoplato- nists, Gnostics and Illuminati, many Quietists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries wished that the whole perfection of man be reduced to the absorption in the Divine Essence, annihilating individuality and private conscience in the absolute Being, or rather in Nirvana. For this reason their Metaphysics is re- duced to Pantheism; their morality to contempt for personal activity and the worthlessness of deeds; and the height of their ambition was to see God by means of immediate intuition. The logical consequence of these doctriness was soon manifest in practical deeds. The ob- sorption in God produces, or results in man's becoming part of the Divinity. When he reaches this state it is clear that, forming a part of God, he becomes essentially pure, and since "to the pure all things</page><page sequence="18">280 THE SOUL OF SPAIN are pure" and holy, he becomes irresponsible for whatever he may do. To express it more clearly, it is not necessary to practice good works because every act produced by the man who already forms a part of God is necessarily good. The natural result of this was that the greater part of these Illuminati gave themselves over to the low- est forms of immorality. Spanish mysticism never fell into such excesses. It never allowed that the sacraments be forgotten, nor acts of charity, good works, nor love of one's neighbor, for in this love of one's fellow creature it sees a sure sign of the love of God. In spite of that scorn of mat- ter, which not only all mysticism but also all Christian doctrine pro- fesses, it condemns with equal energy that complete abandon of the body by which all disorders are so easily excused. It is enough to re- call the works of Fray Luis de Granada: "There are two classes of virtues, the interior and the exterior, for man is neither all soul nor all body, but body and soul together." Thus Christianity is not the interior alone, nor solely the exterior, but the one and the other united. For this reason, he who does not wish to be deceived, but desires to be a true and perfect Christian, must not separate that which is of the body from that which pertains to the spirit. This is very far from the doctrine of the impeccability of the mystic which the Illuminati support. When Spanish mystics speak of annihilation of the ego, they do it with reservation; they feel the need of making an explanation: the soul does not annihilate itself, it does not destroy its own self; it annihilates in itself only that which could divert it from its purpose. Saint Teresa is even more explicit about this important point. She says that, "Charity is the source of action. And although the mystic state seems rather a contemplative life than an active one, when love is well directed Martha and Mary never cease to work together, contem- plation and activity ... The Lord desires good works. If you see a sick person to whom you can give help, let nothing importune you to lose that act of devotion, and in addition sympathize with the sick one, and if she has any grief, suffer it with her, and if necessary, fast that she may eat, not so much for her sake but because you know that the Lord wishes it so." And later in her Moradas she counsels her nuns: "Leave your prayers for an act of charity and alms giving, and if it is necessary to fast in order to feed those who are hungry, fast with joy and happiness." That other great mystic, St. John of the Cross, spent his younger days taking care of the sick. St. Diego, a Franciscan mystic, deprived</page><page sequence="19">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 281 himself of necessary food to feed the poor. St. Thomas of Villanova, Archbishop of Valencia, was called the Almsgiver by his contem- poraries. St. John of God, disciple of John of Avila, founded an order of charity. Fray Luis de Granada recommends time and time again helping the needy, serving the sick, and visiting hospitals. In fact, all the mystics recommended and practiced works of charity. "Spanish mysticism," comments Ticknor, tpossesses the virtue that the whole world in the sixteenth century lacks, Luther as well as the Duke of Alba, Leo X as well as Calvin: mercy or compassion. It is the one thing that stands out conspicuously over the bloody and gloomy background of the most cruel century of modern times." Menendez y Pelayo exclaims: "and this is Spanish mysticism, not sickly or selfish or inert, but virile, energetic and robust, even in the pens of women. No one has described as well as St. Teresa the union of God with the center of the soul; nor has explained it with such pleasing comparisons as that of the two wax candles that join their light or that of the rain which comes to fill up the bed of a stream. But this union does not bring with it annihilation or Nir- vana. The soul recognizes and maintains its own personality." In still another place Menendez y Pelayo continues: "Let others extol the Middle Ages. Each one has its devotees. For Spain the happy age, and the most glorious century, was that in which religious enthusiasm and the almost divine inspiration of the poets was joined with the exquisite purity of the form that came hither on the wings of Grecian and Italian breezes, that century, in which Castilian mysticism, hitherto silent or indistinct, having broken the bars of the prison in which the assiduous reading of Tauler and Ruysbroek had incarcerated it, gave glorious proof of itself, free and immune from all taint of Quietism and Pantheism, and ran like an overflowing current through the field of lan- guage and art. Its most illustrious representatives are Avila, the apostle of Andalusia; the ascetic and severe Peter of Alcantara; the gentle John of the Angels; Luis de Granada of Ciceronian eloquence; Malon de Chaide with his oriental imagination; Luis de Le6n, a serene and pure mind who revealed in his Names of Christ, Christianized Platonic philosophy; and St. Teresa of Jesus who explained the lofty doctrine of personal knowl- edge and of the union with God, with images and comparisons of the most sublime metaphysics." Neither Malebranche nor Leibnitz ever imagined a more supreme ontology. There was no abstraction too subtle, no concept too ele- vated for the Spanish language, so enriched and improved by the mystics, to supply adequate expression. The language was capable of embracing and diffusing the thought of Plato and of the Areo-</page><page sequence="20">282 THE SOUL OF SPAIN pagite in a medium no less harmonious than that of the Greek lan- guage. It is enough to recall the language of Fray Luis de Le6n in the first book of his Names of Christ: Las cosas, demis del ser real que tienen en si, tienen otro aun mas delicado, y que en cierta manera nace de 61, consistiendo la perfecci6n en que cada uno de nosotros sea un mundo perfecto, para que de esta manera estando todos en mi y yo en todos los otros, y teniendo yo su ser de todos ellos, y todos y cada uno de ellos teniendo el ser mio, se abrace y eslabone toda aquesta mi~quina del universo, y se reduzca a unidad la muche- dumbre de sus diferencias, y quedando no mezcladas se mezclen, y per- maneciendo muchas no lo sean, y extendidndose y como desplegindose delante los ojos la variedad y diversidad, venza y reine y ponga su silla la unidad sobre todo. Another characteristic of this Spanish mysticism is the delicacy and subtlety of its psychoanalysis in which the Spaniards certainly have advanced further than the mystics of the North. In my opin- ion, this is due to racial tendencies and conditions of a national char- acter that can be clearly seen in the history of Spanish culture. Let no one be astonished that St. Teresa puts introspection as the most solid foundation of her Moradas. All Spanish philosophy of the six- teenth century, the true and independent philosophy, is character- ized by a marked psychological tendency; from the time when Luis Vives in his treatise on Anima et Vita, anticipating the Cartesian and Scottish schools, defended the method of the silent experience with the inner self, the "tacita cognitio . . . experientia cujuslibet intra se ipsum", to the time when G6mez Pereira destroyed the species intelligibilis and the hypothesis of representation in the process of knowledge and raised over its ruin the edifice which Hamilton calls "natural realism". Differing from other more or less sickly and selfish forms of mysticism, Spanish mysticism gains warmth from the hearth of char- ity and proclaims the efficacy and the value of good works. St. Teresa would never exclaim like Victoria Colonna, the pupil of Juan de Valdes: "Cieco e'l nostro voler, vane son l'opre. Cadono al primo vol le mortal piume." Quite to the contrary, the Spanish saint repeats again and again, "Works, works are the most eloquent testimony of mystic love." Secularism Opposed The logical consequence of the preceding observations is that Spain has stubbornly resisted the secularist and anti-Christian ten-</page><page sequence="21">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 283 dencies of modern civilization. Thousands of examples attest this fact that all through her history Spain struggled against the inroads of such philosophy and culture that might destroy her Christian and mystic qualities. From among the mass of proof that history pro- vides I will choose a few transcendental facts to prove this point: the loss of her Christianity, the loss of her soul, was Spain's greatest preoccupation and this shaped her history from the very beginning to the present day. For instance, let us take the Renaissance. Spain, although she accepted the value of the classical elements in the Greek and Latin writers, was horrified to see the exaggerated and pagan worship of these authors. That she could never accept. As Aubrey Bell says in his Luis de Le6n (Oxford, 1925; p. 41): The sixteenth century in Spain when Spain stood at the head of the nations of Europe, is all the more interesting to study because it bears a strong resemblance to our own age. If we substitute heresy for Bolshe- vism, and Luther for Lenin, and the discovery of America for the develop- ment in flying, we shall obtain a good insight into the various influences at work in men's minds. If we inquire into the special characteristics of the Spanish Renais- sance, we find foremost, a sanity, moderation and balance scarcely to be found elsewhere in the sixteenth century, certainly not in France or Italy. It could not be said of the Spanish scholars, as Ascham said of those of Italy, that 'they have in more reverence the Triumphes of Petrarche than the Genesis of Mose, they make more account of Tullie's Ofices than St. Paul's Epistles, of a tale of Bocace than a storie of the Bible'. In the first years of the Renaissance the doctrines of Erasmus were rather popular in Spain; but when the degradation of human dignity and the relaxation of customs had reached a very lamentable state, then Spain immediately began to oppose these tendencies with all her might, especially the Lutheran doctrines in the Council of Trent where the Spanish theologians won such brilliant victories. In his will, Charles V, who had so often been feign to trim and temporize, charged his son Phillip II to be uncompromising in root- ing out heresy in Spain and her dominions. In this titanic struggle against the Protestant Reformation and the pagan tendencies of the Renaissance, Spain exhausted herself and even though she lost the battle, we can say that there still remains in the Peninsula an enor- mous reserve of moral strength as well as that great portion which was transmitted to her colonies. As Aubrey Bell points out in the book quoted above:</page><page sequence="22">284 THE SOUL OF SPAIN Spain strenuously opposed the Reformation which overthrew scholas- ticism and instead of being content to redress its abuses abolished its subtlety, logic and clear reasoning, substituting vagueness of thought and sentimentalism, and pandering to the individual reason of desires of the uneducated, thus directly paving the way for the horrors of the French Revolution and the state of Europe in the twentieth century. The Renaissance is replete with proofs of the triumph of this Spanish idea over the pagan. There are many facts that we might cite; but let us go on to another important and interesting phenome- non which occurred in Europe, especially in France, in the eighteenth century: the so-called enlightenment. In no other problem perhaps do we see so plainly and clearly the diametrically opposed tendencies of those two countries, Spain and France. The eighteenth century French enlightenment had its root in the Renaissance, in that anthropocentric conception of humanism with its naturalistic currents; while Spain defended with all her strength the theocentric concept, or the Christian conception of humanism. The anthropocentric humanism which began in the Renaissance, reached a climax in eighteenth century France with its intellectual individualism, its rationalism, its skepticism, its materialism, its anti- traditionalism, its license and its humanitarianism that completely lacked Christian charity. The new philosophy of enlightenment was characterized by an opposition to all authority, religion, political, traditional. The ideals of this philosophy were to be found in natural religion, natural law, natural state, force of human reason, unhampered by external bonds. They believed in a "dogma of human perfectibility"; the progress of humanity which would be elaborated into a perfection to be reached in some near future. All these ideas were introduced into Spain and were accepted by many. Immediately, a tremendous reaction took place and one of the most outspoken spirits, Forner, directed the strongest re- sistance against the philosophy of the Encyclopedists. Forner, who incarnated the old Spanish tradition, had no sympathy for the spirit of his time. He alludes to the misfortune of being born in an age which hardly recognizes rectitude in its manner of thinking and judging, and then gives itself the magnificent title of philo- sophic. He calls it rather an age of oracles, an age of ultramontane Sophists who by their boldness and vain verbocity have influenced and won over the common writers to a capricious manner of speak- ing.</page><page sequence="23">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 285 In censoring the attempts of the Encyclopedists to rationalize everything and their repudiation of revelation because they were unable to penetrate the supernatural, Forner categorically affirms, interpreting the traditional Spanish sentiments that no matter what science or religion may investigate, it will never bring about a res- toration in society without taking into consideration the origin of the universe, the nature of man and his works and, above all, God and His designs in regard to man and the world. He points a finger of pride to the fact that Spain has always esteemed religion above all things, however much she has been considered a barbarous, un- cultured and unprogressive nation; adding that in Spain, writers have spent more time, more attention and more paper in writing about God and His Providence and about the inner soul of man than on any other subject. Contrary to the ideas of the philosophies which work for the destruction of revealed religion, Forner considered religion as most essential to man and as natural to him as thinking. To him, man with- out religion is nothing more than a wild man who inhabits the for- est. Religion and morals are the sciences that protect man and pre- serve his dignity and integrity as a rational being. Consequently, religion to his mind, is not only the most important study for man, but his most urgent obligation. And here we have the second in- stance after the Renaissance where Spain opposed the dreams about human happiness on this earth proclaimed by the Encyclopedists. In the long and bitter struggle between the conservatives and liberals during the nineteenth century we witness the same phe- nomen: Spain's fear of losing her soul due to the incursion of secu- larism. From 1812, when the Spanish constitution of Cadiz was pro- claimed, to the present day the tremendous effort of the majority of Spaniards was primarily this defence of themselves against the attack of the so-called liberals who wished to bring about, at all costs, the Europeanization of the Peninsula; and here is their fundamental misunderstanding of the Spanish spirit. It is the same difficulty that the average European, and the North American even more, stumbles upon when he tries to fathom the Spanish puzzle. Spain is in Europe undoubtedly, but it does not have the same characteristics of other European peoples. Spain is Spain and one has to take it as it is and not as one would wish it were. These considerations ought to aid us in the understanding of the Spanish tragedy. The history of Spain is a long tragedy. I would not</page><page sequence="24">286 THE SOUL OF SPAIN dare to affirm that in Spain there are better or more Catholics than in any other nation, but I do assert that there is no other European nation where Catholicism has been absorbed so deeply into the na- tional soul to the point of forming the true national spirit. And since Catholicism is a tragedy for anyone who would embrace it with all its principles and consequences, as the life and passion of Christ was a tragedy, here we have an explanation of the puzzle of Spain. St. Paul said that, considered from an earthly viewpoint, the Christians of this world are the most miserable of men, for the king- dom of Christ is not of this world. The true Christian has to sac- rifice and give up all worldly ambition, all the triumphs and glories of the flesh; in fact, he has to crush within himself the "old man" and create a new spirit whose purpose in life is the conquest of the kingdom of God. This conquest has been accomplished by many souls individually throughout the world but the history of Christi- anity only records one case where an entire nation has thrown itself, with all its resources and spirit, to the attainment of this idea on a national scale. For example, if Spain had not followed Christian theology in col- onizing Spanish America, there would not be a single Indian there today. It would be populated only by the white race, it would be today simply a prolongation of the peninsula. But Spain, in spite of the cruelty of certain conquerors, always considered as her funda- mental duty the salvation of the soul of the Indian, the creation of a people by fusing herself with the native spirit of true Christianity and democracy. This policy caused the complete ruin of Spain in the material order because it created a mestizo class, which became the greatest champion of independence from Spain; but she left there her national Christian spirit which will last until the end of the centuries. Conclusion As a consequence of the phenomena we have observed, that the true philosophy of Spain is her mystical spirit, we arrive at another fundamental characteristic of the Spaniard:-his ambition for im- mortality, so marvelously felt and expressed by Unamuno, which forms the core of every genuinely Spanish soul. This desire for im- mortality is such that Unamuno even goes as far as to say that if there were no idea of immortality Spain would have created it. This</page><page sequence="25">DAVID RUBIO, O.S.A. 287 desire for immortality, this pressing upon eternity determines all the philosophy, all the literary and artistic creation of Spain. This phil- osophy forces the Spaniard to bring his every act and thought into direct relation with God. Other peoples consider what bearing each act in life has on the preceding and the following in an effort to forge a logical chain, to integrate their life, to give it reason on a purely terrestial, horizontal plane; in short, to weave a logical biog- raphy of cause and effect with no break. But the Spaniard, whose method lies in the most intimate recesses of his soul, knows that on this present moment depends eternity. He does not place one action in relation to the other in order to trace the logical temporal scheme of things along a horizontal line as the Frenchman would. No. His every thought and action must have a direct contact with God him- self, it must travel upward on that vertical line which ties his soul to God. Thus he sanctifies his life by sanctifying, one by one, each thought and deed. He wants to live each moment as if he were already united to Eternity itself. To God he consecrates each isolated instant of his life separately, precisely to be able to break this human se- quence, this temporal succession of events, this terrestial order of things. Thus, immediately, for him each moment must be filled with Eternity. In this idea we find the origin of the Baroque in Spain; and because this fundamental idea is not comprehended in Europe there follow misinterpretations of Baroque on all sides. The artistic creation of the Spanish soul, its art and its literature, appear to the European as fragments, as wild strokes of the brush, as pieces chipped by an axe with no apparent order, logic or unity. For the Spaniard unity consists in an inner unity, in that driving thirst for immortality, that inner force that tries to abolish the dis- tance caused by space and time between the temporal and the Eternal Being. We must unite this temporal life with the Eternal. The misunderstanding of this fundamental driving force of the Spaniard has also led to the misinterpretation of the Spanish nada (nothing) and naderias by many who take this word to mean nihilism, and especially Russian nihilism. To the Spaniard that nada is the utter futility of the present moment if it is not related inti- mately with the Eternal. These naderias, this futility of the things of this earth is well expressed in Calderon's Life Is a Dream, in El Greco's Spanish Gentleman, in the masterpieces of Zurbaran and</page><page sequence="26">288 THE SOUL OF SPAIN Valdes Leal, not to mention the superb Couplets of Jorge Manrique: Beholding how each instant flies So swift that, as we count, 'tis gone Beyond recover, Let us resolve to be more wise Than stake our future lot upon What soon is over. This world is but a highway going Unto that other, the abode Without sorrow; The wise are they who gird them, knowing The guideposts set along that road Unto tomorrow. DAVID RUBIO, O. S. A.
