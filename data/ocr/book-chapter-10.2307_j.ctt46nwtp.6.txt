I’m on the pas- senger side of his cavernous government-issue Ford Expedition, and we’re  talking about the work he’s been doing lately on permits throughout the  monument.  “I’m working on twelve permits right now, some for paleontological re- search, some for oil and gas exploration. The larger ones, where they’re  going to signifi cantly disturb the surface, require environmental impact  statements and input from a lot of experts—archaeologists, paleontologists,  biologists, geologists.”  Titus has spent the last several days checking up on a number of ura- nium mining operations in the Circle Cliffs, administrative work I get the  feeling he’d rather leave to someone else. Alan Titus is a searcher and an  educator. He’s hiked all over the Southwest and he discovered one of the  two specimens of dinosaur skin impressions unearthed in Utah. Alan has  authored or co-authored dozens of papers on paleontology with zippy titles  like “Discovery and Excavation of a Therizinosaurid Dinosaur from the  Upper Cretaceous Tropic Shale (Early Turonian), Kane County, Utah”  and “New Records of Vertebrates from the Late Cretaceous Tropic Shale  of Southern Utah.” He’s also written a book about ammonites called Late  Mississippian (Arnsbergian Stage-E2 Chronozone) Biostratigraphy of the Ant- ler Foreland Basin, California, Nevada, Utah (the Antler Basin was an ocean  basin on the east side of an island mountain back in the Late carbonifer- ous Era, about three hundred million years ago). I’ve leafed through this  catalogue of ammonites and it’s a little dry to me, but it pretty accurately  demonstrates Alan’s mindset. “The truth is, only those who make paleontology the entire focus of their  lives are going to make it,” says Titus, “and I can’t really imagine doing  anything else.” The doctor is an intense individual, the kind who can talk about develop- ments in his fi eld for hours on end, and in his former incarnation as a col- lege professor at Snow College and the College of Southern Idaho—that’s  exactly what he was paid to do. His passion about ancient life has kept him  young; he’s three years older than me but he looks fi ve younger, like he’s  barely pushing thirty, and he has the energy level of an excited seven-year- old. He calls the new monument the “frontier.” We turn onto Hole-in-the-Rock Road and his truck skims over the wash- board at forty or fi fty miles per hour with no problem. I point to the brush  off the roadside. </page> <page sequence="4"> Ha r d  R o a d s     111 Dinosaur “undertrack,” Twenty-Mile Wash “If we were in the Heap,  we’d be over there by now,”  I say. We talk about the politics  surrounding the monument’s  creation and about an orga- nization called the Grand  Canyon Trust, which until  recently was buying up graz- ing permits for permanent  retirement in riparian areas  of the monument. “We’re required to treat  their applications with the  same objectivity we would  anyone else’s,” he says. Titus is well aware of the  local sentiment toward the  new monument, but he had  nothing to do with its cre- ation. Like most government  workers in the area, he’s caught in the middle of a dispute he had no part in  raising. We drive by cud-chewing cattle—“wild cows” I call them, “slow elk,” he  says—and take a side road toward Left-Hand Collett Canyon and pull over  by a white lobe of Entrada Sandstone and begin hiking up the side. I’ve heard Entrada called the “stuff which dreams are made of.” The arch- es and windows and fi ns of Arches National Park and the fi ns near Moab,  are formed from Entrada Sandstone, though they have more red pigment to  them than the rock we’re climbing. Navajo Sandstone will usually erode into  high precipices and narrows but Entrada has a different genetic tendency  and it weathers into standing waves and potholes, portals and locules, whorls  and knots, knobs and hoodoos and shapes that don’t yet have names.  We pass small lattices in an outcropping, something I would never have  paid attention to if Alan weren’t with me. “Bee colonies,” he says. Then he  points to faint, tangled etchings in the rock face and says, “worm trails.” During the middle Jurassic, what’s now Twenty Mile Wash was a sand  desert, like the Sahara, arid and mostly lifeless. But some things large and  </page> <page sequence="5"> 112     H i g hw ay  12 carnivorous walked across its edge and we fi nd their tracks, or rather their  “undertracks,” the sand displaced from beneath the prints, along a bench  near the top of the fossil dunes. They were discovered in 1997 by Josh  Smith, a colleague of Alan’s, who was looking for a place to ride his moun- tain bike.  “There’s a major road coming down Right-Hand Collett Canyon” he  tells me, “It runs right past here, but these tracks were discovered less than  fi ve years ago.” This is the frontier.  We take turns walking in the prints, making long  strides to match the dinosaur’s leisurely gait. Alan thinks these prints, which  have their own fossil name, Megalosauripus, were either made by Allosaurus,  meat eaters whose remains are the state fossil and which each weighed as  much as a car and had scythe-like teeth, or by a creature much like them. He  shows me another print where I can discern the impression of the pads on its  feet, which are about three times the size of my own feet. “And remember,” says Alan, “it was leaning into its stride, so we don’t see  an impression of the whole foot.” He shows me some more prints, called Brontopodus, made by a smaller  sauropod: hand-sized impressions left by the front feet, larger ones made by  the rear feet and a snake-like pattern down the middle left by the tail.  The BLM is mapping the Entrada outcropping with a camera mounted  on an eighteen-foot-long, tethered blimp, which drifts high and surreally  over the terrain.  The eolian, or windblown, sand which made up the Entrada was depos- ited at the edge of an inland sea, the Middle Jurassic Seaway, which slowly  withdrew north beginning about 170 million years ago. The continent had  been split off from Europe and the great island of Pangaea and as it rode  over the Pacifi c plate, the western edge was compressed and later, during  the Cretaceous, eraginated by thrust faults and piled up to form the Sevier  Orogenic Belt. The relatively dense rock of the Pacifi c Basin slipped down  toward the asthenosphere at a shallow angle and the resulting magma forced  its way up through weak spots in the crust to form volcanoes. The Sierra  Nevada was forming deep within the earth at this time from a solidifying  pool of magma which would later be exposed by erosion. Sediments from west and south of Highway 12 washed down through em- bouchures to fi ll the basin from which the sea had retreated, and dinosaurs  roamed this new plain, which became the Morrison Formation. Paleontolo- gists fi nd the bones of herds of massive, ophic-necked, bulb-headed sauro- pods, the largest of which weighed as much as three loaded semi-trailers, and  of armored Stegosaurs with their egg-sized brain pans and of Allosaurs and  smaller predators like Ceratosaurus, which were seven feet tall at the hip. </page> <page sequence="6"> Ha r d  R o a d s     113 The sediments immediately above the Morrison Formation were eroded  away, leaving a gap in the record, which picks up again about one hundred  million years ago when eastern Utah was a lush, forested lowland, much  like present-day Louisiana, rife with fast lizard predators. Alan believes that  while the sauropods like 120-plus ton Ultrasaurus may not have needed a  high metabolism and were probably cold-blooded; theropod hunters like Al- losaurus may well have been warm blooded, i.e. capable of sustained, rather  than just explosive bursts of speed. The latter were probably fairly bright  even by the standards of today’s predators and they had a top speed of per- haps twenty-fi ve to thirty-fi ve miles per hour. What’s more, they may have  hunted in packs, so even if you could outrun one, which a human couldn’t,  it’s brother or cousin might be waiting for you up ahead. The early Cretaceous is preserved in the Dakota Formation. Above it, the  Tropic Shale records the return of the inland sea and the temporary exodus  of dinosaurs, and this is where Alan and I pick up the trail again. He drives  me to another site not far from the fi rst, and we hike up onto a crumbly shelf  of rock covered with paleocurrents, into the sandstones and mudstones and  siltstones that once lay at the sea bottom. Before I can catch my breath or  get my bearings, Alan has shown me a half-dozen petrifi ed oyster and clam  shells, distant ancestors of the kind we pry open today for dinner and pearls,  with names like Cardium curtum and Exogyra olisiponensis. When I ask about  a certain type of shell once known as Gryphaea and now as Pycnodonte, he  provides an example within about fi fteen seconds. We also fi nd fragments of ammonite shells. He holds them up to me and  as I try to see the cross section, he examines them for such exotic character- istics as “suture lines,” “whorl sections,” “umbilical shoulders,” and “ven- tral prongs.” Ammonites, relatives of the chambered nautilus, appeared  on the scene about 390 million years ago and were wildly successful and  prolifi c during the Cretaceous. Their ubiquity throughout the Paleozoic  and Mesozoic Eras makes them a perfect index fossil for the correlation  of strata. When the dinosaurs died off sixty-fi ve million years ago, about  two-dozen genera of these creatures went with them. This last fact makes  Titus skeptical of theories that rely on super-germs or climatic changes  to wipe them and the dinosaurs off the earth. The ammonites had three  hundred thousand millennia to adapt to pathological organisms and they  had endured gradual climate changes just as powerful as anything in the  late Cretaceous. Whatever killed them all had to have been sudden, violent  and global.  Occasionally the Tropic Shale will offer up something more than clam,  turtle and ammonite shells. Paleontologists have recovered fossils from  sharks which hunted in the shallows and forty-foot-long marine reptiles  </page> <page sequence="7"> 114     H i g hw ay  12 with four-foot skulls and jaws which could unhinge like a snake’s to swallow  large prey whole. We climb back in the behemoth and drive west, through Escalante, to an- other outcropping off the side of Highway 12, this one belonging to the John  Henry Member of the Straight Cliffs Formation. When this formation was  laid down the sea was withdrawing from southern Utah, though it wasn’t a  straightforward retreat; the Interior Seaway would draw back then fl ood over  the basin again, withdraw and advance, and this happened at least twenty- three times, until, at the Drip Tank Member of the Straight Cliffs Formation,  which was deposited about eighty-four million years ago, it made its fi nal  departure from this place. During this time, the shoreline of the Interior  Seaway and the outwash plain from the Sevier Highlands alternated between  swampland and river plain, depending on the proximity of the sea.  We climb up a narrow wash to a crumbling cliff face in the Wahweap  Formation and Alan begins fi nding fossils immediately, some still entombed  in rock, some free: fi sh scales, snail shells, a beautifully preserved crab claw,  dinosaur bone marrow and ammonite shells. We fi nd a clamshell still closed  on itself. “He’s still in there,” says Titus, handing me the rock. “You’ve got to break it open to get at the soft part,” I tell him. We examine the cliff face closely and it turns out to be composed of mil- lions of frangible layers of paper shale, sheets of sediment like freshwater  varves, deposited by spring runoff each year. It’s the completeness of the geologic record which draws scientists from  around the world to the national monument. Alan tells me there may be  better examples of certain types of fossils in Mongolia or the badlands of  Alberta but the monument’s record of the late Cretaceous terrestrial ecology  is the most comprehensive on earth. Each layer is like another page and each  fossil like a written word to those who can read the text.  “You can only get the whole story here,” Titus tells me. We drive on and Alan talks about dinosaur skin, specifi cally Hadrosaur  skin. I would imagine it looks something like elephant hide but I’d be wrong.  Hadrosaur integument was a tessellation of “polygonal tubercles,” discrete,  thick, raised pentagonal or hexagonal plates, the largest about one and one- half inches across, which radiated off into smaller, increasingly diamond- shaped polygons, especially toward the underside and along the tail. The idea of being able to run my hand along dinosaur skin fascinates me.  The rock seems to have preserved everything but the living reptile itself.  From Alan’s point of view, fossil remains like these make the monument  a gold mine, and that’s why he gets so upset about the illegally operating,  amateur fossil hunters he has to compete with. Dinosaur bones tell only part  </page> <page sequence="8"> Ha r d  R o a d s     115 of the story; much of the data paleontologists collect comes from the fossil’s  context: nearby fossils which could date the fi nd, gastroliths (also known as  “gizzard stones”), which dinosaurs ate to help grind up foliage in their stom- achs, and the strata from which the dinosaur emerged. Some fossil hunters  use picks and dynamite to free their wares and sell them by the pound. The  contextual elements are completely lost, and fossils like skin impressions are  almost always destroyed in the extraction process. To Alan it’s like “going  through the Louvre and stealing the pedestals and lights.” There are currently no federal laws dealing specifi cally with fossil theft  from national parks and monuments. On the rare occasions where fossil  hunters are actually apprehended in the act on federal land, they’re charged  with “theft of government property.” Still traveling west, we come to the Kaiparowits Formation, known lo- cally as The Blues. In terms of scenic value, The Blues are rather mediocre;  they’re badlands but not the colorful variety. In fact they’re a uniform, drab  allcharite-gray, and the strata are slumped and streaked with brown stains  and studded with pinyon and juniper and wiry saltbrush. Most travelers on  Highway 12 breeze past the ugly gray slopes without giving them a second  thought, but Alan’s eyes light up as we approach them. This landscape is cur- rently ground-zero for worldwide paleontological research.  Much of the Kaiparowits’s blue-gray hue was imparted by carbon from  decomposed vegetation. The soil itself was alive at one time. We walk along  the bottom of a wash and Alan studies the vergence of sediment; sharp lines  indicate a steep gradient and vigorous river activity while horizontal cur- rent-bedding relates to a more languid pace. Riverwash and point bars ac- cumulated along slow-running streams and rivers, and so did dinosaur car- casses, settling out of the purling current like a heavy element, like gold.  Alan points out rust-colored circles in the claystone—petrifi ed wood. Then  we come to a block of stone with a huge bone stuck out obliquely. “That’s a Hadrosaur femur,” Alan says, almost nonchalantly. Judging from the coxa at the end, which is as large as a soccer ball, it must  be at least four feet long, and the detail is perfectly preserved; it’s museum  quality. Further on, Alan shows me where he found a fossilized, seventy-fi ve mil- lion-year-old turtle shell that had fallen right out of the cutbank after a hard  storm, where it had bounced off a wall and come to rest. Apparently, this  sort of thing happens all the time. The soft sediments of The Blues are con- stantly eroding, and this process is constantly unearthing fossils. In the Kaiparowits, paleontologists have recently discovered a specimen  representing an entirely new genus of Ceratopsia, a category of monsters  which includes the Triceratops and the even larger Torosaurus, a horned plant  </page> <page sequence="9"> 116     H i g hw ay  12 eater with a huge, plated neck frill and a skull over nine feet long, and a par- rot-like beak for slicing through tough vegetation.  Sparrows dart past us at eye level. The dinosaurs are still among us,  though in an altered form. Modern birds evolved from dinosaurs; some “ter- rible lizards” survived the great extinction by learning to fl y. Though they  walk with the same posture as dinosaurs and have the same footprint as some  dinosaurs, it’s hard to connect something like a sparrow or a hummingbird  with an Ultrasaurus.  The dinosaurs are extinct, and they’re here, reincarnated in a differ- ent form. When you follow something which you thought was familiar far  enough back, you may fi nd the bizarre, the grotesque.  The mountains through which we ride were once sea fl oors. The abyss has  been raised up, and it’s all around us. I think about the layers of the Straight  Cliffs Formation, the millions of pages of geologic text, each recording the  subtlest changes in dinosaur skeleton morphology, and I think about how  that text has itself been transformed and metamorphosed by time, how lay- ers of sediment laid down parallel to the earth’s core could be wrapped and  bent into folds. Time exists in layers as well. Escalante Back in August of 1866, Andrus’s men were struggling through the same  gray muck, turned slick by a thunderstorm that would later prove a bonanza  for paleontologists. They emerged from The Blues, what adjutant Franklin  Woolley describes as “deep almost perpendicular gullies worn in the moun- tain side by the storms of ages” into the Upper Valley of the Escalante,  “a beautiful park, green grassy meadows, groves of timber on Sloping hill  sides, streams of clear, cold mountain water shedding into a Small open Val- ley forming the Centre of the picture” (Crampton, 153). This valley they  followed until they encountered “a succession of deep hollows with Steep  rough rocky sides almost impracticable at fi rst and worse as we proceeded,”  where they were forced to detour back down to the valley bottom. In the  process of getting there, one of their horses tumbled down the slope and  broke its shoulder, necessitating them to shoot it. They camped in the valley and the next day shook off the frost which  had settled on them and crossed the icy North Creek and came into what  was then called Potato Valley, for the wild tubers which grew there, and  they camped that night at the present site of Escalante. Woolley wrote that  the area was “level, easy to irrigate, fertile, facilities surrounding it for the  support of a thriving settlement of one hundred and fi fty families. . . . Fuel  and timber abundant, excellent range for cattle, hay accessible in valley at  Timber Park, within a distance of 10 to 12 miles” (154). </page> <page sequence="10"> Ha r d  R o a d s     117 Andrus and his men tried to continue east but they found the “whole of  this country from the mountains to the River . . . cut up in all directions  by these narrow deep perpendicular crevices, Some of which are hundreds  of feet in depth and but a rod or two in width” (Crampton,154), and were  obliged to detour again up Pine Creek, through “Steep rough diffi cult kan- yons, and side hills” (154) to the sublime, montane uplands of the Aquarius  Plateau and Boulder Mountain.  John Wesley Powell’s Mormon scout, Jacob Hamblin, came to Potato  Valley in 1871 by the military expedition’s route from the Paria through  Tropic Valley and over The Blues. He mistook the Escalante River for the  Dirty Devil, which actually ran about forty miles to the northeast and pro- ceeded south through the slickrock toward the Colorado, where he was to  cache Powell’s supplies, for fi fty miles before quicksand and impassable ra- vines turned him back. When he reported the failure, Powell decided to  have him leave the provisions at the Crossing of the Fathers downstream. Next year, Almon Harris Thompson, who was in charge of the second  expedition down the Colorado during Powell’s frequent absences, tried to  reach one of the expedition’s boats, the Canonita, cached at the mouth of  the Dirty Devil River, by an overland route, and in the process he corrected  Hamblin’s mistake. Thompson arrived at Potato Valley by the same tedious  route as Andrus and Hamblin, up a “horribly steep” trail through the “steep  gulches and steep ridges” of The Blues (Gregory, “Diary,” 80), to Birch Creek  and then Hamblin’s “Dirty Devil.” Thompson climbed to a vantage point in  Harris Wash where he could see the Henrys, then called the “Dirty Devil”  or “Unknown” Mountains, and the tips of the Abajos and the crestline of the  Aquarius Plateau, and he saw the “Dirty Devil” Hamblin had described for  what it was: an unmapped, unnamed, unknown river which the Colorado  expedition had completely missed because the canyon through which it ran  narrowed to insignifi cance at its mouth. This was the last river in the con- tiguous United States to be named by a European-American and he called it  the Escalante, in honor of Father Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, the Spanish  explorer whose party crossed the Colorado, nearly one hundred years earlier,  sixty or so miles due south of where Thompson was overlooking the river.  Returning four years later by a northern route, Thompson met four Mor- mon scouts in that valley and he suggested they call the town they were plan- ning by the same name as the river, and they apparently thought it was a  good idea. The names of the pioneers who settled into Escalante those fi rst  few seasons are now the names on the landscape: Barney Top, Griffi n Top,  Roundy Reservoir, Alvey Wash, Allen Creek, Heaps Canyon, Shurtz Bush  Creek, Hall Creek, Twitchell Creek, Joe Lay Reservoir, Liston Flat, Collet  </page> <page sequence="11"> 118     H i g hw ay  12 Top. They dug canals the fi rst year, returned to Panguitch for the winter and  came again to settle, living in dugouts with whitewashed walls and rock-pile  fi replaces and roofs of dirt shoveled over poles. Lacking a fl ag, they saluted an  Indian blanket on the Fourth of July, 1876, and when they had harvested the  crops that year, they got down to the business of building a Mormon town. The settlement was originally laid out on the north side of the Escalante  River but that was good farmland, so the townsite was moved to the op- posite bank. The pioneers’ original dam on the Escalante gave out so they  dammed it again two miles upstream, and when that dam breached in a fl ood  two years later, they moved upstream and built a pile dam. When the stream  changed channels, they moved another quarter-mile upstream and threw  fi ve-thousand wagonloads of rock into the bed and poured one-thousand  sacks worth of cement on top of them. That dam held the river in check  (Woolsey, 97). They set up a sawmill in 1877 at North Creek and built a schoolhouse  that doubled as a church. They quarried clay adobe from the creek’s north  side and fi red it into brick to build their houses and they turned their dug- outs into “backhouses” for storage. In 1879, they built a gristmill two miles  northwest of town and in 1885 they started putting up a proper two-story  sandstone church. They wove their own rugs and carpets and sewed their  own clothes, raised bees to make honey and planted molasses cane at the  mouth of Calf Creek so their children could have sweets (Chidester, 94). Settlers from the San Juan Expedition began arriving in late 1879 and the  townspeople shared their supplies and their knowledge of the surrounding  terrain and some of the men left off work improving their own lands to help  build the road down to Hole-in-the-Rock. Charles Hall, Bishop Andrew P.  Schow and Reuben Collett became scouts for the mission, and Hall’s sons,  John and Reed, helped him build a raft to carry the pioneers across the  Colorado.  In 1902, a year before Escalante was offi cially incorporated, the towns- people blasted a 380-foot tunnel through a sandstone ledge past one of their  canals to bring water to the southern reach of Escalante. They later built  two reservoirs: the North Creek Reservoir, completed in 1938 with WPA  labor, and the Wide Hollow Reservoir which had fi ve times the capacity of  its predecessor (Woolsey, 98-101, Chidester, 99). The settlers brought in cattle to graze the slopes of the Aquarius Plateau  and the Upper Valley, prizing milk above beef because Escalante’s early trade  economy ran off butter and cheese. As time went by and more mills were  built, timber was added to the mix, and wool, too. The sheep herd brought  in from Kanarraville in 1876 was wiped out by the winter cold but Joseph  </page> <page sequence="12"> Ha r d  R o a d s     119 and Earnest Griffi n brought more in the fall of 1877. Joseph Barney brought  three separate herds of sheep into Escalante, one of over two thousand head  (Woolsey, 130). The combined grazing of huge herds of sheep and cattle was more than  the range could handle and half the livestock on the range starved to death  in the four-year drought that began in 1896 (Chidester, 161). With no grass  to hold it, the gullied land washed down to the Escalante.  The ranchers knew their woes had been caused by overgrazing and poor  range management and when the federal government set the Aquarius Pla- teau and much of the land around Escalante aside as a forest reserve, they pe- titioned it to add more lands between Main Canyon and Upper Valley as well.  In 1907, local ranchers formed a cattlemen’s association, with a charter to: promote and protect the business of raising cattle and horses upon and adja- cent to Powell National Forest, to work in cooperation with the Forest Service  in administration and use of the National Forest grazing lands and to work  in cooperation with the Grazing Service in the administration of the Public  Domain. (Woolsey,148) Livestock was threatened by lions and wolves and by a giant, sheep-eat- ing grizzly bear named Bruno, who fi nally went down after a three-hour  running battle with hunters who’d riddled him with thirty rounds (Woolsey,  397-401). A fi ve-year ban on hunting and a bounty on predators in the early twen- tieth century turned deer from a scarce commodity into hungry pests which  competed with livestock for forage, and the pioneers reversed the ban to cut  down their numbers. Black Hills beetles destroyed tens of millions of board feet of timber in three  major infestations between 1919 and 1954, and the Engleman spruce beetle  killed tens of thousands of acres of spruce around Escalante between 1916  and 1928, with some of the loss recouped by the sale of downed trees mines  for timber frameworks. Joyce Muench wrote about the “Ghost Forests of the  Aquarius Plateau” in Westways magazine in 1956, when there were still large  swaths of dead stands. The local timber industry fought back by cutting and  burning infected trees, then by spraying uninfected trees with insecticides. When the pioneers had turned the creek to do their bidding and created  reservoirs to slake their thirst and water their fi elds in drought and when they  had killed the wildlife that preyed on their stock and brought the exploding  deer population back under control, when they had built their schools and  churches and stores and two-story brick homes and helped the missionaries  </page> <page sequence="13"> 12 0     H i g hw ay  12 on their way to the San Juan River and Bluff and had harvested the timber and  successfully fought off the Black Hills beetle and the Engleman spruce bee- tle and saved the rangeland from overgrazing by their own cattle and sheep,  that’s about when their little town of Escalante began to die from within. Each  drought, each fall in the price of wool, milk, beef or timber would shake some  family loose to look for better pastures up in the Snake River Plain of Idaho  or Wyoming’s wide-open horizons or even the fast-growing cities along the  Wasatch Front. Often it was the young who left in this fashion, seeing as they  grew up that there was no place for them in Escalante. As Nethella Griffi n  Woolsey writes in Escalante Story, “Escalante has long been engaged in export- ing a great many of her people, particularly her youth” (363). Prices for beef and wool skyrocketed during the First World War, but  fi nancial gains were offset by other losses in 1918 when Escalante, like every  other town in Utah except Boulder, was hit by the Spanish infl uenza. Some  ranches were left short-handed and couldn’t move their stock to the winter  ranges. There was a hard winter and the ranchers found nearly all the cattle  left on Fifty Mile Mountain “dead in piles” (Woolsey, 137). Then the market  plunged, and the cattle left alive and the wool gathered that spring became  worthless. Ranchers went bankrupt and many left for good. Those who stayed be- hind mortgaged their spreads to rebuild their herds while the market slowly  recovered, the prices for wool and beef steadily improving until 1929, when  the combination of the great crash which knocked prices below nothing and  a severe drought obliterated all the gains the stockmen had made over the  previous decade. The ranchers who kept on tried to make up their losses by pushing more  sheep and cattle on the already overcrowded range. Melvin Alvey estimates  there were as many as forty thousand sheep grazing around Escalante prior  to the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, and he characterized the range as a “dust  bowl” (Haymond, “Alvey,” 12). That same year was the “driest of record in  the history of Utah on all watershed(s) in the state” (Cannon, 310), and up  north, near Grantsville, Utah, stock were actually smothering to death on  the dust (312).   When the government stepped in to save the dusty range from overgraz- ing, it received no gratitude from the Livestock Association, which peti- tioned to “have nearly every ranger removed over a period of twenty years”  (Woolsey, 138). This was the beginning of a deep enmity between rancher  and ranger, often between brother and brother and father and son. Escalante was a wreck of a town during the Depression, with its old rip- gut fences and rutted roads, leaning plank shacks and children in rags and  dust clouds blowing in from the desert. Nearly all the range around town  </page> <page sequence="14"> Ha r d  R o a d s     121 was “severely eroded and badly overgrazed” (Cannon, 314) and the crops  had all failed (315). There were two Civilian Conservation Corps camps  nearby and nearly three-quarters of the population was on some type of  welfare. It was the sort of place you’d expect to see in a Dorothea Lange  picture, and in fact she visited the town and photographed downtown Escalante, some of the farmhouses and a few of the pioneers still trying to  eke out a living. But that was over a year after Everett Ruess came through in 1934, at  the height of the calamity. Ruess spent a couple of weeks exploring side  canyons of the Escalante River and camping on its banks, participating in a  dance or two and attending church, socializing with the children from town,  even taking a couple of them to Death Takes a Holiday at the cinema. Then  he wrote a letter to his brother Waldo and another to his parents. He wrote  them he wasn’t sure which way he would go next: north to Boulder, south  by way of the Kaiparowits Plateau and Smoky Mountain or down along the  scarpline of the Straight Cliffs and across the Colorado to the Navajo Reser- vation. In the end, he chose the last option, loading his burros Chocolatero  and Cockleburr and setting out along the old Mormon trail for Hole-in-the- Rock where, he wrote, “no one lives” (Rusho,196). Death Ridge The headline in the March 6, 2003 edition of the Garfi eld County News read  “Woman Dies, Man Survives Week-Long Challenge in GSENM.” Down  past the lead, the article quotes the driver, a Londoner: “On the map, it  looked like an easy trip to Escalante.” Traveling east from Kodachrome Basin, they got their Jeep stuck in the  mud near Death Ridge, which got its name from the cattle that froze there  one winter, and they waited a week for someone to rescue them. They sur- vived on sunfl ower seeds and Skittles and ran the Jeep occasionally to stay  warm, and meanwhile a spring storm dumped almost a foot of snow on  them. Finally they decided to walk out, heading back the way they came, but  the girlfriend could only make it four miles and the driver left her beneath  a tree and kept walking all day and through the night and met up with a  couple locals near Kodachrome State Park the next morning. By that time  the girlfriend had frozen to death. I’m on that road now and I’d planned to be there at the same time that  couple was traveling through, but the water pump went out on my wife’s  Mitsubishi and I tried to fi x it and failed (in my defense, you have to take the  whole front of the engine off, including the timing belt, to get at the water  pump). We had to spend the money I was going to use for the trip to get the  car fi xed and the trip was delayed by a week.  </page> <page sequence="15"> 12 2     H i g hw ay  12 Could I have helped them? If the mud didn’t turn me back, then yes.  Could they have helped themselves? According to the locals I grilled on  the subject, absolutely. They could have helped themselves by bringing wa- ter along and something more substantial than light jackets, and they could  have brought more food, and they could have helped themselves by knowing  how their vehicle worked. From what I understand, when the rescuers got  to their Jeep, it wasn’t even engaged in four-wheel drive. Furthermore, I  doubt they tried airing down the tires or driving out at night when the mud  froze up. And it sounds like they had no idea how to get a fi re going with wet  tinder, and the guy should have walked his girlfriend back to the Jeep before  going after help, or he shouldn’t have brought her along when he tried to  walk out, no matter what she said. This is the kind of story locals love to tell: ignorant city-folk getting lost  in the boondocks. But having talked to a few members of the Search and  Rescue team in Escalante, I understand it’s not the typical scenario. Most  travelers on these roads and most backpackers have some idea what they’re  getting into and take the necessary precautions and only run into trouble  when they get injured. Or mauled by wildlife, maybe.  I park the Heap at the top of Trap Canyon, probably less than a mile from  where those two got stuck, and walk into the narrows, and the fi rst thing I  come across is fresh bear tracks, one large set and one small, both headed  down-canyon. I’ve met a black bear with a cub before in the woods and we  all just went our separate ways, but I wonder what would happen if I came  across bears in the narrows. What if these two forgot something and they  were coming back and we all met? Would we pass without incident, them  grunting and me tipping my hat?  Horses must think this way because the canyon was named by ranchers  who corralled wild horses here. Apparently horses didn’t have much use  for such tight passageways. The narrows only continue for about a mile  and then the canyon opens up and becomes thick with vegetation: pon- derosas and limber pine, cottonwoods and shaggy spruces and scrub oak  thickets, purple thistle, serviceberry, mountain mahogany, buffalo berry,  the ubiquitous yuccas, barrel cactus and prickly pears bearing red fl owers  from areoles. Such a profusion of life is unusual on the Colorado Plateau,  except at higher elevations. The narrows themselves are unusual for the  Kaiparowits Plateau in that the Wahweap Formation, which makes up most  of the plateau, normally crumbles under its own weight before the walls get  this steep. I fi nd more bear tracks and some wild turkey tracks but no bears or tur- keys. The sky is an even gray sheet, obviously full of moisture, but it’s been  that way all morning and it hasn’t let go yet. I return to the Heap and drive  </page> <page sequence="16"> Ha r d  R o a d s     12 3 Illustration by Norton Allen, from Henderson, On Desert Trails, 142 (Used with per- mission of Westernlore Press) up a steadily worsening road to Death Ridge. Hunters can continue along  the ridge for miles but I just came for the view. The overcast sky doesn’t  make the Kaiparowits any prettier; it’s mostly slumped, gravel-gray hills and  scab-brown scrublands and crumbly yellow ramparts. The one thing it has  going for it is that it smells like pine after a rainstorm. A wall of rain, fi lmy like smoke, breaks over the next, heavily-timbered  ridgeline and for a moment this place looks like the Cascades. The rain curtain drifts north and the view opens up. There are supposed  to be several north-trending anticlines around here but the covering of veg- etation makes it impossible to read the strata. Out on the plains of the Kai- parowits, the geologic text is closed to my eye. But others could still decipher it. Dutton gave the Kaiparowits only a  cursory treatment and neither Thompson nor Gilbert spent much time on  it, but geologist Herbert Gregory brought a pack train through the track- less eastern half of the Kaiparowits in 1915 and returned in 1918, 1922,  1925 and 1927 to continue his studies, and what he and his associate, Ray- mond Moore found, as they relate it in their 1931 work The Kaiparowits  Region, A Geographic and Geologic Reconnaissance of Parts of Utah and Arizona,  was coal. </page> <page sequence="17"> 12 4     H i g hw ay  12 I drive out to Four Mile Bench and the colors and landforms are the same,  and the ground cover is too thick with sage and pinyon and the geology too spineless for my tastes. The bench itself is a rolling plain with an occa- sional arroyo feeding into the dry forks that feed into major canyons where  the vegetation is stripped away, like Warm and Wahweap Creeks. Had cer- tain interests prevailed, that bedraggled Londoner would have come to a  fi ve-thousand megawatt, coal burning plant here, but those plans died off in  the mid-seventies. The Utah Wilderness Coalition blames poor economics  (UWC,148) but the locals blame them, and I don’t know why they wouldn’t  want to take credit. According to their literature,  Nine thousand acres of vegetation would have been destroyed during con- struction. A network of roads, power lines, pipelines, pumping stations, and  coal slurry lines would have blanketed the western half of the Kaiparowits  Plateau. A new road 67 miles long would have cut the Plateau in half, bringing  the thunder of heavy truck traffi c rolling across the heart of the area. . . . One  hundred and twenty million tons of solid waste would have been dumped in a  1,550-acre disposal area on Fourmile and John Henry Benches. A new town of  20,000 would have wiped out 4,000 acres of critical antelope habitat on East  Clark Bench (147).  Not to mention the tremendous amount of air pollution that would be gen- erated, which they do.  But there’s more. Two days later, I fi nd myself at the other end of the Kai- parowits, at a place called the Burning Hills, and that’s no misnomer. I spent  most of the previous day crawling down the Croton Road, which is a slow  journey even when the road has been graded, which it was. I crawled from  Big Sage past the huge green backslopes of Fifty Mile Mountain, past an  old rock shelter in an alcove right next to the road, past fasciate taupe cliffs,  past Navajo Canyon and East of the Navajo, with the wind blowing strong  in every direction while two weather systems battled for possession of the  plateau, as they had for the last week, with the light on those massive plains  narrowing to a promise and then blinking out and Navajo Mountain glow- ing white, then red, then fading into the blue airglow, down to where the  land fi nally started falling away from the plateau into dead gray ash plains,  and I could see the tops of the three huge smokestacks of the power plant at  Page, Arizona. I camped on a ridge where giant black bats swooped through  the night, unaware of how close I was to my goal, and in the morning I saw  the smoke rising from a butte not two miles distant. I get as close as I can on the blackened mining roads, but the roads them- selves have been cut by vents, which are ringed with chemical hues of yellow  </page> <page sequence="18"> Ha r d  R o a d s     12 5 and orange and a crusty, neon-green fungus, and smell like hot asphalt. I  test the ground as I pick my way around them and I get up to one vent that’s  exhaling a steady column of poisonous black fumes. Closer in, I can hear the  draw of air. It’s the same sound a gas furnace makes. Closer still, I feel the  heat and see an orange glow like a sunrise in the chamber beneath me. From the slope, I can see how the ground around this butte is slumped. It  gets even worse seven miles west, around Smoky Mountain, where the land  is incised by deep fi ssures and the slaked sandstone cap cracks loose into  massive slip blocks which settle towards the bottom of Last Chance Creek.  The coal is so abundant here that it spontaneously combusts and burns the  mountains from the inside out, and then the mountains crumble.   Most of the mining would have taken place at the south end of the  Kaiparowits, where the coal-bearing seams of the John Henry Member  of the Straight Cliffs Formation have the least overburden. There’s about  sixty-two billion tons of coal beneath my feet and it would be economi- cally feasible with present mining techniques, to extract about 11.3 billion  tons, which would translate into about 223 to 330 billion dollars (Blackett,  1997). In 1991, Dutch-owned Andalex revived plans to mine into Smoky Hol- low after those billions of dollars of coal. The amount of surface disturbance  created by their mine would have been small, but it would have been neces- sary to create a new road or improve Smoky Mountain Road to the point  where it could be taken over by double and triple trailer trucks running all  hours down to Cedar City, Utah or Moapa, Nevada. This is the operation  President Clinton effectively killed by declaring the creation of the Grand- Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1996. And the curious thing is  that the same environmental movement which had worked so hard to stop  the mining project had been most responsible for reviving it in the fi rst  place. The coal beneath this plateau is known as “compliance” coal because  it allows power plants to comply with sulfur emission standards set by the  Federal Clean Air Act of 1990, which had been heavily promoted by the  environmental lobby. And here’s another curious thing: the Southern Utah Wilderness Alli- ance, which was instrumental in killing the proposed mine, continues, to this  day, to downplay the quantity and value of the coal under the Kaiparowits.  SUWA was one of the prime movers in bringing a big project worth an un- earthly amount of money, which had a lot of momentum, to a complete halt,  and that’s nothing to be modest about. So I can only assume they are actually  trying to sway their constituents to the view that the government overpaid  Andalex to give up its mining claims on the plateau. </page> <page sequence="19"> 12 6     H i g hw ay  12 This sort of behavior isn’t limited to one side. Politicians routinely em- ploy phrases like “over a trillion dollars of coal,” being “locked up” beneath  the Kaiparowits when in fact the recoverable coal amounts to mere hundreds  of billions of dollars. The purpose for these overstatements, by the way, is to  get the coal fi eld excluded from the monument’s boundaries, which would  add another strange twist to the saga because the whole purpose behind the  establishment of the monument was to protect from exploitation the land  over those coal fi elds. The mine’s absence contributes more to the current political rhetoric  than the mine itself ever could. As long as it remains in the realm of poten- tiality, it will continue to grow in value and infamy.  As for the plateau which was spared by Clinton’s proclamation, its worth- lessness has more value now than the hundreds of billions of dollars that  lay beneath it. In this sense, the battle to “save” the Kaiparowits is similar  to another environmental battle taking place out on the West Desert, near  the Deep Creek Mountains, where a faction of the Goshute Indians, who  are related to the Paiutes, are fi ghting the state for the privilege of storing  nuclear waste on their reservation. Somehow the Goshutes ended up being  shuffl ed onto some of the most economically worthless land in the state,  and the land around them was worthless in the same respect—so worthless,  in fact, that nobody else really wanted to live out that way, which also made  the Goshutes’ reservation so isolated that a corporation specializing in waste  disposal now considers it a prime candidate to receive lots of radioactive  waste, and lots of money, too.  So, too, has the Kaiparowits become worth so much by sheer dint of the  fact that it has been shunned by most people for most of recent history. It is  part of the last, largest de facto wilderness left in the lower forty-eight, and  now that someone’s found a use for it other than scientifi c study, it’s too late. Or maybe it’s not. As Alan Titus said, “that coal isn’t going anywhere  anytime soon.” If we as a nation decide sometime in the future that the value  of the coal beneath the Kaiparowits outweighs the plateau’s scenic and sci- entifi c value, it will always be there.  In my case, the Kaiparowits is valuable because it’s a wilderness—not a  wilderness area but a true wilderness, a true refuge from civilization, from  the city, from rules and regulations and prejudices whereby we’re all guilty  until proven innocent. I’m drawn to it because it’s one place where the good  Samaritans who would free me from want and fear, from cigarettes, drugs,  guns, religion, meat, fast food, my parents, low taxes, high speed limits, high  blood pressure, my own bad attitude and my own car have not yet penetrat- ed, though they are, at present, massing on the border. </page> <page sequence="20"> Ha r d  R o a d s     12 7 The Kelly Grade at the south end of Smoky Mountain The Lost One winter day, I travel down to the pictographs in Alvey Wash. I look into  the pinpoint eyes of a wedge fi gure who guards over the main route onto  the plateau. I discover three individuals with their arms raised up as if they  were greeting me, or perhaps, as the recumbent fi gure in the corner of the  mural suggests, they are armed and ready to mete out the same punishment  to me, and I fi nd a red man with his arms outstretched beneath an overhang,  faded.  I camp in Camp Flat, as seems appropriate, and read a few passages by  fi relight from Wild Horse Mesa, which is the name Zane Grey gave to the  Kaiparowits. What he wrote is pretty much what I see. Low down the distant rock surfaces were gold; above them the sky was yellow.  Canopying this band of pale sky stretched a roof of cloud, an extension of that  </page> <page sequence="21"> 12 8     H i g hw ay  12 Formation on Nipple Bench canopy enshrouding the mesa, and it had begun to be affected by the sinking  sun. At fi rst the infl uence was gradual; then suddenly occurred swift changes,  beautiful and evanescent—white clouds turning to rose, with centers of opal,  like a coral shell. . . . The fl at roof of the cloud took on a fi ery vermilion; the  west end of the shroud became a fl ame, and mesa, sky, mountain slope and  canyon depths seemed transfi gured with a glory that was not of earth. (12-13) Next day I hurry down through Pete’s Cove and Dry Bench and  Reynolds Point and get beaten up by the Heap because the weak-willed,  rocky road wraps around every hill and sinks through every draw and accommodates every other landform in the vicinity in some way, and I con- tinue to Ship Mountain Point where I lose time looking for a route that will  get me closer to that thin white ridge so I can climb it some day, and then  the road straightens out on the back of Smoky Mountain, and I can open  it up a little because the washboard isn’t bad enough yet to shake the Heap  into the sagebrush.  </page> <page sequence="22"> Ha r d  R o a d s     12 9 There’s only scrub brush here; no trees, no shade. I pass by the Smoky  Hollows—there are two of them, actually, one on each side of Smoky Moun- tain. Over the edge of the plateau I see Navajo Mountain, which Domínguez  and Escalante called “the Black Mountain,” with the sun right over it and its  face, which looks to the sky rather than the horizon, shining like a full moon,  and beneath it, on the near side of the lake, I can see the beginnings of the  dead white rock oddity plain where those two explorers and their retinue  scrambled around for days like trapped rats, but before I get to that, there’s  something else I want to investigate. I pull off the main road and drive only a  short ways out and there’s a vent belching mephitic black vapor like a smoke- stack and everything within a radius of one-hundred feet except me is dead.  I hold my breath and get in close but there’s nothing to see, just more of the  same, and no sound, so this soot is coming from deep inside the mountain.  No sense in saturating my clothes with this smell, so I keep going, right  off the edge of the plateau,  down the Kelly Grade, which  points the Heap’s nose into  the plain and circles down an  old dugway from the pros- pecting days like the path of  a fi ghter jet in a death spiral. There’s no vegetation  here, either, just towering  smoke-gray shale deadwalls  around the amphitheater  where Squaw Canyon and the  “dry arroyo” of Warm Creek  (Warner, 117) empty out. The  badlands on the piedmonts  are beautiful to my eyes, as  is all of the lifeless wasteland  on this side of the plateau.  Every day the sunlight burns  these crags and plains clean  and every evening the wind  picks up and the night comes  over them like a storm, fi lling the washes with shad- ow rivers. I’ve spent days  Bluff on Nipple Bench </page> <page sequence="23"> 13 0     H i g hw ay  12 Sand ripples near Kitchen Canyon down on these benches, explor- ing the shale waves, and I fi nd  myself drawn to them now, but  there are other places I want to  explore. The road splits for Big  Water and Sit Down Bench, and  I head for the latter, traveling  along the base of the plateau. A side road takes me out to  Alstrom Point, which the map  says is about fi ve miles away, and  fi ve miles is an hour in this ter- rain. The view is worth the trip.  Alstrom Point is on a peninsula  of rock jutting out in the middle  of Lake Powell. From its edge,  I can see an expansive island fl at  that shouldn’t be there, with  scrub starting to grow on it and  past the sand bank that’s nine- hundred feet below me, I spy  the tops of stone buttes about  to peek through the surface, but  menacing the toy boats down  there in the meantime. The low brush on top of the  butte is parched, and nine hundred feet below, Glen Canyon is drowned.  Widstoe died of thirst and Paria was destroyed by fl oods. The washes which  feed the lake run as torrents or run dry. The days are hot and the nights are  bitterly cold. There are very few in-betweens. Domínguez and Escalante circled around the base of Romana Mesa,  which is before me, and got caught up in a “strong blizzard and tempest  consisting of rain and thick hailstones amid horrendous thunder claps and  lightning fl ashes” (Warner, 118) in Gunsight Canyon, which is just east of  me. They prayed and the storm abated and they continued east past the  base of Gunsight Butte to Padre Canyon, where they chopped notches  into the rock for their horses and descended and crossed the Colorado  at a point which is now over fi ve hundred feet beneath the surface of the  lake (120). </page> <page sequence="24"> Ha r d  R o a d s     131 Beneath the lake, in a drowned layer. It’s interesting for me to read the  father’s names for their camps and compare them to what’s there now.  Levan, Utah, for example, was San Bernardino, Scipio was Oje de Cis- neros, Milford was San Rustico and the Valle de Nuestra Senora de  la Luz, “The Valley of Our Lady of the Light,” is now the Beaver River Valley. But those earlier names are gone now, except in Escalante’s journal,  just as the Paiute names are nearly all gone. Just as the lake covered the  place of the father’s crossing, so have the names been covered over, again  and again. Hole-in-the-Rock Road The Heap and I are about to be strafed by a Stealth Fighter. It’s a thumb- sized parallelogram a hundred feet over the desert right now but its black  matte surfaces are shifting and its vector altering until there’s no horizontal  gain; it just gets bigger. The Heap sputters and rattles a bit; the engine is tied  to its mounts with electrical wire and the radiator is spitting fl uid and the  whole mess could fall apart if driven over seven miles per hour. But there’s a  seventy-million-dollar killing machine sighted squarely on us and approach- ing at a hundred times our  speed and I’m thinking about  hitting the accelerator any- way and taking my chances. The stealth fi ghter attack  is just the latest mishap on a  journey fi lled with bad luck.  It began the day before when  I dropped into Left-Hand  Collett Canyon on the rocky  bed of a gulch, what the map  described as a road. The road  it connected to (Hole-in-the- Rock) was washboard, which  Jeeps have a hard time negoti- ating, their wheelbases being  just short enough and their  suspensions just stiff enough  for it to literally shake them  apart at any speed between  seven and forty miles per  Washboard south of the Cockscomb </page> <page sequence="25"> 13 2     H i g hw ay  12 hour. Being in a hurry, I chose the above-forty option and came to regret it;  a pothole sent the Heap airborne and upon landing, the drivetrain sheared  off its mounts and sprang forward and imbedded the fan in the radiator. The fi ghter veers at the last moment, crossing the road about a hundred  yards in front of the Heap, and it’s followed a few seconds later by a low  rumble, like thunder coming over a ridge. I count twenty-eight seconds be- fore the pilot clears Fifty Mile Mountain, by inches, and consult the map  and do some quick math and fi gure he’s doing about 650 miles per hour. With this black angel alighting on me, I have to question the frame of mind  and series of events which brought me here. Where, I wonder, did I go wrong? The most important axiom of four-wheeling, which could apply to any  activity in the wilderness and which I’ve consistently fl outed, is ‘never go  alone.’ Witness my descent into Left-Hand Collett Canyon: the initial grade  was so steep and the spring weather had turned it so muddy that I wasn’t sure  the Heap could crawl back out again if the trail downstream had been blocked.  Two writers, Edward Abbey and Mark Taylor, author of Sandstone Sunsets,  both nearly met their ends by dropping into narrow, unscalable canyons from  which there was no obvious exit; Abbey was fortunate enough to have a walk- ing stick along and he used it as a makeshift ladder to gain a tenuous purchase  and drag himself, by his fi ngertips, out of a stone draw (Desert Solitaire, 227).  Taylor just yelled until someone found him (12). Both could have avoided the predicament they found themselves in if they’d had a partner with a rope  on the lip of the canyon. If the trail down Collett Canyon had been blocked and if the Heap  couldn’t make it back up, I could have walked out, but a friend with a winch  on his vehicle at the top of the canyon would have given me peace of mind. Then, too, I was on a tight schedule. Unless you’re fl ying into this coun- try, it’s hard to keep appointments with people or landforms anywhere off  the main road. The San Juan Expedition of 1878, the architects of Hole-in- the-Rock and the road leading to it are a good example of how such think- ing can get you in trouble. There were actually two expeditions to reach the exposed southwest fl ank  of the new kingdom of Deseret. While those called to serve sold off their  possessions and rendezvoused around Widstoe and Escalante, an advanced  party struck out for the San Juan River along a circuitous southern route,  past Jacob Lake near the north rim of the Grand Canyon, then east past the  present town of Tuba City, deep in Navajo territory, and fi nally northeast to  a spot just above the San Juan where they found enough prospective farm- land in a place they called Montezuma Fort to begin a settlement. Unfor- tunately, water was so scarce on the journey and the Indians so hostile that  </page> <page sequence="26"> Ha r d  R o a d s     13 3 the route was out of the question for the main party. Another way had to  be found, and quickly because the advanced expedition didn’t have enough  supplies to last them through the winter, and if the wagon train’s departure  was delayed until spring or summer, it would be too late to plant crops for  the coming year. There were two options: the Spanish Trail, blazed by New  Mexican traders a half century or so earlier, which skirted the roughest ter- rain but wasn’t suitable for wagons and took 450 miles to arrive at a destina- tion less than half that distance as the crow fl ies, or an entirely new route  through the wilderness and across the Colorado River. The initial scouting reports concerning this second route were favorable.  Charles Hall, one of Escalante’s founders, had gone so far as to drag a sin- gle-axle wagon down through the notch in the sandstone escarpment which  came to be known as Hole-in-the-Rock and ford the river and climb the oth- er bank, and it appeared a route could be hewn through the rock on the far  side. Add to this reconnaissance the expedition’s youth—the average age be- ing about eighteen—and it’s faith, and Silas S. Smith, the expedition’s leader,  doesn’t come across as quite so crazy in choosing the “shorter” route.  Soon after the wagon train set out, scouts returned with more realistic  reports of stone ramparts, aphotic chasms and a more accurate description  of Hole-in-the-Rock—a nearly vertical two-thousand-foot plunge to the  Colorado. Platte D. Lyman, leader of the scouts and later de facto head of  the entire expedition, would later describe the terrain as “the roughest white  men ever undertook to pass over” and “the roughest country I ever saw a  wagon go over” (Miller, 162). There was talk of turning back before winter  set in, but Smith prayed the night of the scout’s return and by morning had  concluded that the expedition would continue on its present course.  The majority of the pioneers didn’t actually make it to the starving mem- bers of the advanced party at Montezuma Fort, who were being harried by  Indians, but they did come within eighteen miles. That last distance might  have been the easiest leg of the journey but by the time they reached the  present location of Bluff, Utah, four and a half months later than their best  estimates, they and their remaining animals were at the end of their endur- ance. They looked around, saw rich bottomland that might yield a good  crop and settled where they were. Not a single human life was lost on the journey, although an older mem- ber expired about a month after their arrival, presumably from exhaustion.  Little wonder. Again, we have Lyman’s account of the wilderness they passed  through, which was “almost entirely solid sand rock, high hills and moun- tains cut all to pieces by deep gulches which are in many places altogether  impassable” (Miller, 163), and also the account of George W. Decker, who  </page> <page sequence="27"> 13 4     H i g hw ay  12 was fi fteen when he joined the expedition: “(It was) the most rugged gorge,  the most tempestuous river, the loneliest and most frightening country I  have ever seen” (Miller, 202).  Silas S. Smith had parted company with the mission early on to procure  funding and powder to blast through the rock, leaving Lyman, who’d argued  against the route from the beginning, in command, and Lyman’s charges  picked and blasted Hole-in-the-Rock until it was wide enough to accom- modate wagons. Lamont Crabtree, who chronicled their struggle in The In- credible Mission, estimates they removed nine hundred thousand pounds of  sandstone from a single one-hundred-foot stretch of the trail (43). The pioneers rode their roughlocked wagons down the forty-fi ve degree  slope with livestock and men yoked behind them as living ballast. They  forded the partially frozen river on a 16’ x 16’ raft and climbed a defi le on  the far bank, crawled up Cottonwood Canyon and blasted more pathways  for the wagons through solid rock—Little Hole-in-the-Rock, the Chute,  and the Slick Rocks—then crossed an otherwise impenetrable canyon on a  sand dam, since washed away, and hewed their way through a cedar forest,  their animals all the while falling from precipices or collapsing in their tracks  or being slaughtered for food. Winter set in early and the trailblazers built  their road in blizzards and a scouting party become lost in a storm and its  members nearly died. Comb Ridge, the fi nal impediment, is a rock wall nearly one thousand  feet high and thirty miles long. The train ran south along its length, the  pioneers hoping to fi nd a way around it, but they had no such luck: it ter- minated at the San Juan River, which was running too fast and cold to ford.  Exhausted, the missionaries continued on the only way they could, blasting  a road into the ridge and whipping their weakened horses, mules and cattle  with azotes to pull the wagons up the steep slope, sometimes on their knees.  Many of their animals collapsed into convulsions and some died on the spot,  and the trail was marked by “the dried blood and matted hair from the fore- legs of the struggling teams” (Crabtree, 112). The San Juan Mission, you  see, had a schedule to keep. The Stealth Fighter isn’t the end of the adventure. Back on Highway  12, the carburetor gives out and I have to coast and push the Heap and  sometimes crank the dead engine off the warranteed starter over steep rises  in the silent dead of night to get ten miles back to Escalante, where I fi nd a  friend the next morning in the form of a rock-hunting demolitions expert,  who drives me around town to get parts. There’s more radiator repairs on  the Navajo Reservations and I get the Heap back home in one piece, but  I’m late. </page> <page sequence="28"> Ha r d  R o a d s     13 5 The upshot is, I don’t try to keep a schedule when traveling the desert  south of Escalante. I let someone know where I’m going and approximately  how long I’ll be gone, I take plenty of water and all the tools I might need,  but I leave my watch in my pack and calculate time by the sun, and usually I  make it to my destination in due time. But not always. Hole in the Rock Redux My second attempt to reach Hole-in-the-Rock hardly goes any better. I  drop a full fi ve-gallon gas can in the back of the Heap and fi ll the tank and  the other can on the rear fender in Escalante. I keep the speed below seven  miles per hour, but lose half a tank before reaching the Devil’s Garden. I pull off into the garden’s parking lot and explore by foot. It’s late Oc- tober and cold enough that I have to wear a jacket. I start on the trail but  I get drawn off to the yardang terrain, the arches and pedicels and ancient  dune combs, cones and ripples and solution caves, and then I walk the dry  creek bed and climb back up to a terrace with black concretions scattered  over it. Sand is piled against the stone’s edge and into wells at the bottom  of rock funnels, and lizard tracks arc from shady junipers to black sage and  disappear onto slickrock. The wind sweeps grass awns around and their tips  inscribe runic fi gures in the sand which I try to interpret, but I don’t know  the language. Dark clouds scuttle north and the colors fade with the sunlight. I boil  some rice on the stove and pour heated chili over it. By the time I’m done  eating, the sun is a pale pink oval behind gray scrim. I’d planned to camp on Fifty Mile Bench again but the further I go, the  more apparent it becomes that the gasoline situation is going to be tight.  The Heap is averaging a pathetic seven miles per gallon and things will  probably get worse as I near the road’s southern end, which is hewn from  solid rock. The problem, again, is washboard, which is a harmonic oscilla- tion, a self-reinforcing pattern of rills built up by a thousand bouncing truck  suspensions. Every time the speedometer creeps above seven miles per hour,  the Heap’s framerail shakes as if it’s about to snap at the welds. A couple of  times I fi nd a smooth stretch of road and open it up, but as soon as I hit the  washboard the succussion fi shtails the Heap violently and I have to slow  down across the speed barrier. When I was listing the mistakes I made on my last journey down Hole- in-the-Rock Road, I might have put more emphasis on bringing the right  equipment and making sure what I do bring works, and the Heap isn’t work- ing in this particular circumstance. So what happens when your transporta- tion is completely unequal to the terrain? As the monument in the propheti- cally named Carcass Wash will inform you, on June 10, 1963, the driver of  </page> <page sequence="29"> 13 6     H i g hw ay  12 a truck carrying Boy Scouts from Salt Lake City and Provo in its bed and  headed for Hole-in-the-Rock, where the boys planned to board boats and  ride down the Colorado, killed his engine near the top of the dugway on  which I’m now parked and mashed his brake pedal to the fl oor to stop the  beast with no effect. He tried to negotiate the curves in reverse but the  truck’s speed overwhelmed its maneuverability and he dumped his precious,  screaming cargo over an embankment, and then the truck rolled over them,  killing thirteen and injuring twenty-six.    I give up on Hole-in-the Rock. Tomorrow I can explore the narrows of  Dry Fork, but the faint disc of sunlight has fallen to near the top of the  scarpline and raindrops are beading on the windshield. On my map there’s  a side road leading to Batty Caves almost directly east of the narrows in  Spooky and Peek-a-boo Gulches, so I go back and turn onto the road and  start climbing toward the mountain. The road is gullied, steep and windy,  and it goes on for a long way, over dry stream channels and deep sand beds,  into the apron of waste rock at the cliff’s base.  There’s a turn off to the left, up a rock ramp, and it’s level on top, a good  place to camp. I give up on my quest and ride up, unfurl the fl apping tarp in  mild gusts and tie it to the Heap’s passenger side and stake it down. A cold  drizzle begins to fall. When I come around to the back of the Heap, I see a  cave about one hundred feet away, behind some brush, so I pull the fl ashlight  out and investigate. The cave is forty feet deep, maybe twelve feet high, the walls even  enough that they must have been blasted out with dynamite, and there’s  a shallow, twenty-foot long metal boat hull in it. There are no navigable  bodies of water closer than Lake Powell, past Hole-in-the-Rock, so I won- der what the boatmaker’s plans were. Then I wonder if what I’m looking  at really is a hull. It sure looks like one, with its metal ribs and a sharp end  like a bow.  A few yards down, a weathered, wooden screen door that creaks on its  hinges closes off the second cave. I step inside, shine my fl ashlight around,  over two bed frames, a table, a bench. Wood stakes in the wall support shelves  of black shalestone. The cavern is about thirty feet deep and its camp ceiling  is ten feet high. The fl oor is smooth concrete.  The third cave has a wide barn door and a workbench inside. I fi gure it  must have been a tool room and garage. The caves are about fi fteen degrees  warmer than outside. Suddenly, I have new plans. The rain’s tempo picks up. I quickly transfer my junk to the cave, which  is remarkably clean. After dinner, it’s time to relax on the front porch  and watch the darkness seep across the land and the beaded lightning </page> <page sequence="30"> Ha r d  R o a d s     13 7 strobe-freeze the muddy rivulets washing over the gulch’s edge. The thunder  splits the gurgle of running water and echoes off fi fty miles of Cretaceous  cliffs, and below me, the gully overfl ows with rainwash. It’s almost cold enough to snow. I return to the cave and settle in, and  when I turn out the light, I hear mice scurrying about and trying to escape  through the screen. It’s so warm, I can sleep on top of my bag, with just a  blanket over me, but I don’t go to sleep for a while because I’m laughing so  hard. Later, I discover Batty Caves’ origins. They were blasted out by a cou- ple of prospectors, brothers by the names of Bill and Cliff Lichtenhahn, collectors and purveyors of petrifi ed wood, jasper, uranium and whatever  else they could lay their hands on, back in the early sixties. The third cave  held a machine shop. The object in the fi rst cave really is a boat hull which  they planned to fl oat in Lake Powell (Woolsey, 172). Next day the sun is shining and I smell the moisture and pungent tama- risk and cottonwood. I fi nd the spot I’d planned to camp under a foot of wa- ter, and discover that the Heap has been invaded. I slept in the mice’s abode  and they escaped and took over my vehicle, helping themselves to my corn  chips, instant rice, and bagels. I cache my things behind a boulder above the second cave and drive down  to Dry Fork, past a rusted brown wreck of an old car half-sunk in the earth.  Again, I seem to have the place all to myself. I stumble around for a while looking for the entrance to Peek-a-boo slot,  hiking down a draw and up a sand dune and then I fi nd the crack in the rock  and march into it, and pretty soon I’ve got the camera and tripod in front of  me and the water bottle in my trailing hand. There’s enough room for me,  turned sideways, and that’s it. An overweight person would become jammed  and other hikers would have to climb over him until he lost enough weight  to squeeze through or died of cold or hunger or thirst or was popped loose  and torn limb from limb by the next fl ash fl ood. My baseball cap won’t fi t between the walls when I turn my head, and I  don’t really need it. I leave it on an outcropping.  At certain points I have to exhale to get through. Above the cornices, the  sky is a crooked line of blue spar. As the gulch weaves, the sun rises and sets  across the fi ve-foot horizon. The rock is rounded off, gouged, planed. There  are small arches like pentices where water has impatiently broken its way  through rather than going over obstructions. Where the walls open up into  chambers, there are shadowed pockets and smooth lenticular outcroppings,  like eyes and brows and giant maws covered with cauls, which coalesce into  wraithlike countenances, faces of the damned and the lost. </page> <page sequence="31"> 13 8     H i g hw ay  12 I shout into the vault and the echo returns to me instantly and only once,  compressed and distorted as the wall’s form and imbricate texture, unfamil- iar enough to seem like the effect of an esoteric branch of physics. It’s as if  the sound evaporates a few steps beyond me and some other disturbance  dissipating an equal amount of energy returns from the other side of the  invisible barrier. In other places, the canyon is anechoic. The silence is compounded on  itself and sound is isolated down to its essences: the squeak and scuff of my  shoe soles on sandstone and my breathing.   I hop over the fi rst few shallow pools I come across, then pull my shoes  off and wade through the cold water of the deeper ones.   The canyon expands into an alcove where more familiar laws of physics  briefl y reassert themselves. The sun stays risen, sound travels and the hori- zon opens from a slit to a rough circle. There’s life here, too—Mormon tea  and monkey fl ower clinging to the rock.  I rest for a while in the sunlight and continue, anxious to get to the end  of this canyon, not because I’m short on time but because there’s something  drawing me on. After a few more coves and tight squeezes, the path curves  up through loose rock and the channel widens from four feet to maybe forty  and the horizon falls away on the left to a sand bank and time and space  ripple outward like a shock wave. A side trail takes me back down to Dry Fork and then over to Spooky  Canyon, which has a plunge pool at its mouth and a log ladder propped to  the entrance on the far wall. That’s not my style, especially when I have a  camera with me, so I climb up a bluff with striations offset like one foot map  hachures, to a point where I can look down into the slot canyon.  There’s enough pools down there between the membranous walls to  make travel diffi cult so I resolve to explore Spooky another day, and I retreat  to the Heap, making a quick side trip to retrieve my hat. I pack up my be- longings and pour a couple gallons of gas into the tank, vowing next time to  bring enough fuel to make the Heap into a rolling bomb, and head north as  the Straight Cliff’s shadow slinks over the sandstone convolutions, toward  the hidden river. The Brand Inspector Arnold Alvey is a short old bowlegged cowboy who was born and raised in Escalante. I meet him in May of 2003 at his newer white house which is next to a barn and a stable and a pioneer home he uses for storage. He’s got red-rimmed eyes and not much white hair left on his head, and he’s wearing overalls and he’s forgotten about our meeting but he seems  </page> <page sequence="32"> Ha r d  R o a d s     13 9 willing to make the time to talk. We go inside and he puts his glasses on and draws some of the local brands, shown here, beginning with his father’s:       The following is the local brand of Gail Bailey: A couple of the Listons’ brands follow:       This is the brand of Mac LeFevre: And fi nally, this is the local brand of Ivan Lyman: Brands, he tells me, are read right-to-left, top-to-bottom and outside to  inside. If the symbols are touching they’re “connected” and if two symbols  share the same line as part of the design, they’re “combined.” Thus Gary  Haw’s brand is W H Combined: Other than numbers and letters, brands commonly contain slashes /, cir- cles O, half-circles ( , bars —, diamonds ♦, boxes [ ], triangles ∆, hearts ♥,  and crosses +, but the vocabulary is pretty much inexhaustible. A chevron  symbol ^ above a fi gure is a “rafter” and an upturned half-circle beneath  a symbol makes it a “rocking” brand. For example, the Boulder Mountain  Ranch’s brand is the Rocking C: If the half-circle is above the symbol, it’s “hanging”: Symbols with wings, like Sorenson’s (next page), are “fl ying.” Symbols  with lines slanted down to the right are “walking”:  And if the lines are slanted down to the left, they’re “dragging”: </page> <page sequence="33"> 14 0     H i g hw ay  12 Symbols are generally identifi ed as “reversed” (also “backward”), or as  “lazy” if they’re on their sides or “crazy” (also called “inverted”) if upside  down. Tilted symbols are “tumbling.” Leland Haws brand would be Reverse  L H Combined: The brands Alvey gives me clear up a few mysteries, but I’ve got about  three dozen more brands he doesn’t recognize because they’re too old or  they’re out of his jurisdiction, which doesn’t extend down into Kane County.  Also, it becomes apparent to me pretty quickly that there were hundreds of  brands throughout the history of Garfi eld County. And none of them really  stood that much above the other until recently. “Everyone made a living off ranching, everybody had a farm and they  raised grain and hay and there were no really big outfi ts. Most of them ran  150 to 600 head: none of them owned two or three thousand,” he says.  The ranchers called the north half of the Fifty, which runs north-south,  the West End and the south half the East End. I don’t know why and neither  does Alvey. He gives me a rundown of who owned which parcels out on that  rangeland and it includes him and otherwise it’s a confusing mix of Pollocks,  Alveys, Baileys, McKinnleys and fi nally, Griffi ns and Dell LeFevre. “Joe Pollock, whose brand was 44, used to run cattle on the Fifty,” he  tells me. “And before him Philo Allen had all that range. Used to have the  whole mountain but when the Taylor Grazing Act come in, they broke that  up.” “That’s remote country out there where you used to run cattle,” I say. “Two-day fl ight out there for a humming bird,” he tells me, “You know  if there’s anything out in that country worth having, they ought to let a man  have it. Even the lizards pack canteens out there.” “Yeah.” “It’s just a long ways to no place. Not fi t for God, man or the devil.” “Yeah, well—“ “I don’t think they ought to allow the tourists out there ’tall unless they  got decent supervision—,” he says. “If your car breaks down—“ “These people that died just last winter was just on the edge of it and they  should never have been allowed to come into that country ’tall. I think they  should have been blocked right there or there should have been some signs  there that told them, ‘Hey, folks, you’ll get in trouble if you don’t know what  you’re doing.’” I try to get back to the brands. I ask him if there’s any big operations  now. </page> <page sequence="34"> Ha r d  R o a d s     141 “Now we got this guy Sorenson who’s come in and bought up a lot of the  grazing land. I don’t know if that’s good or bad. Here’s his brand, Flying V.” I ask him how the art of branding has changed in his lifetime. “These guys nowadays need a stamp, and they get a bunch of blotched  cattle. When you put a stamped brand on a critter and he moves a little bit,  which they usually do, and you take it off and put it back on, you blot it. But  with a running iron, like they used to use, you don’t blot it. And you want  your brand plain as possible, so anybody can read it.” “So you can tell when you’re dealing with somebody experienced?” I ask  him. “Yeah, and it’s gone downhill considerably. Same thing with earmarks  which used to be done to perfection. It’s changed two-hundred percent.” The War Steve Gessig owns a sheep ranch on the edge of Escalante from which he has  prosecuted the war for western land rights for the last decade or so, some- times on his own, sometimes in concert with groups like the unfortunately  named, now defunct “People for the U.S.A,” but when he fi rst came to Utah  it was as an enemy of the grazing industry he’s now a part of. “There was a lot of monkey wrenching going on. I’d never really been  around cattle or anything like that. When I moved here I was a vegetarian  and I tried beef one day and that’s all it took,” he tells me, “I started raising  cows and I raised cows until three years ago.”  I’m talking with Steve and his girlfriend Toni Thayer, an environmental- ist, on a November day in 2002, in Steve’s living room, and he’s wearing  jeans and a T-shirt that says something derogatory about the U.N.—I can’t  quite read it. Steve’s got his hair slicked back and he’s got a gray goatee and  he’s probably put on a little weight since he left Berkeley, and in his laid- back, southern California tone, he relates how he made the transition from  environmentalist to rancher. “I got to know the local people and learned about local history and I was  moved by it all. I saw what they went through and it changed my mind.  These people weren’t corporate ranchers and they weren’t bad people and  they weren’t ruthless like they’re made out to be; they were just families try- ing to make it.” Steve is currently involved in a dispute with Kane County over Hole- in-the-Rock Road. It was an R.S. 2477 road, which means that it was constructed prior to 1976, when the Federal Land Policy and Management  </page> <page sequence="35"> 14 2     H i g hw ay  12 Sign north of Widstoe Act (FLPMA) was enacted and so would have been grandfathered in as a  grant to Kane County. However, a FLPMA clause called Title V would  transfer Kane County’s rights to the road over to the federal government.  “We’re fi ghting that like crazy,” says Gessig, “We have a lawsuit against  the federal government that was done with the slush fund that Marty Ste- phens (then Utah’s Speaker of the House) set up and that money is being  used to take ten roads in Utah into court to prove they are R.S. 2477,  but in the meantime Kane County has signed a Title V on one of those  roads.” But Steve and Toni have had troubles closer to home. Steve is on the board  of the smaller of Escalante’s two water districts, whose source is Pine Creek,  which runs through some state-trust lands Governor Leavitt sold off, and he’s  been fi ghting the BLM, the new owners, over rights to the water. We take a  drive out to the fl ume Steve recently put in and walk down a dirt track. “They put a ‘No Vehicles’ sign up here, in the road,” says Gessig, “ I tore  it out.”  We walk upstream from the fl ume and he points to a curve in the stream- bed where he’d planned to put in a small hydropower generator, a plan  which was shot down by environmental appeals. “For hydropower?” I ask. “Isn’t that clean energy?” </page> <page sequence="36"> Ha r d  R o a d s     14 3 Steve shrugs. He shows me where the stream runs underground through  a pipeline. “We were hurrying to get this done before the land reverted to federal  ownership. We were putting the pipeline in and they fl ew a helicopter over  us and they came down here with measuring tape and I had ended up going  fi fteen feet too far here.” Steve drives me around town and fi lls me in on other aspects of the war. He  shows me what’s included in his district’s water rights and we stop at the gen- eral store for some groceries  and Steve introduces me to  Lenza Wilson, the mayor,  who happens to be buying  groceries, and I think there  has to be a mistake, this is  just a kid in jeans and a jeans  jacket, looks like he’s not old  enough to buy beer. In fact,  Lenza is thirty and he’s in  his second two-year term as  mayor and he skipped a term,  so he was fi rst elected when  he in his mid-twenties, and  then he must have looked like  he was thirteen. But when he  opens his mouth, it’s obvious  Lenza didn’t stumble into the  job or get it because nobody  else wanted it, although I hear  the salary isn’t commensurate  with the responsibility. I ask  him why one of the town’s  two lumber mills closed re- cently. Was it because of the  environmental regulations?  The spotted owl? “It’s a complex situation,”  he says, “The market is bad  and it doesn’t show much  signs of improving, and  Steve Gessig at the f lume </page> <page sequence="37"> 14 4     H i g hw ay  12 there’s been a pronounced change in where you can cut, and on top of that,  environmentalists are trying to block all the sales.” Why is the Southern Utah Wilderness Association trying to stop the new  Wide Hollow Reservoir, which the farmers say they need to survive, from  going in? “First off, it’s payback because Escalante has been on the forefront of  the environmental battles and we’ve opposed SUWA at every turn. Second,  some of them probably have some actual concern that the reservoir will lead  to development. But in fact, the reason we’re trying to put the reservoir in  is to keep agriculture viable. We’re trying to put it in because we like it here  and we like it the way it is. If ranchers and farmers can’t make a living here,  they’ll have to sell out, and then you will see development.” How many lawsuits, which environmentalists brought against the BLM  or Forest Service, involved Escalante?  “That would be a massive number,” he says, “Every timber sale that I can  think of, for years, they have either appealed or fi led a lawsuit. SUWA has  been the most active group in that respect.” As we drive back to Steve’s ranch, he tells me about the grazing situation,  and he fi lls me in on the story of Mary Bullock, “Wild Cow Mary,” a mav- erick rancher who ran cattle on Fifty Mile Mountain and basically thumbed  her nose at the BLM when they asked her and her neighbor Quinn Griffi n,  repeatedly, to pull them off the drought-stricken range, and so the BLM  fi nally had them taken away.  “The ranchers were told there would be no changes to grazing, and the  next thing you know, every rancher had to do an environmental assessment  on his rangeland and they had to tell the BLM where they put their salt licks,  what roads they were driving, and so for the fi rst time the cattlemen have a  lot of restrictions on them.” Quinn Griffi n, the rancher who was in the middle of the range confl icts  soon after the monument was dedicated, is now mostly involved with lo- cal real estate and has also become the salaried head of the yet-to-be con- structed Escalante Center, which will be a sort of research clearinghouse  for the monument. Quinn is out of town now, down in New Mexico learn- ing the intricacies of government grants, so I stop in and see his parents, Delane and Thais, at their house near downtown Escalante. Delane was  born in the now vacated brick home across from the elementary school and  spent practically his whole life in Escalante.  Decades ago he and his dog  “Spunk” guided Randall Henderson, author of On Desert Trails, and anthro- pologist Jesse Jennings to the top of the Kaiparowits Plateau in a quest for  </page> <page sequence="38"> Ha r d  R o a d s     14 5 “Moqui” cliff dwellings by way of the same Batty Canyon where I sought  shelter from the storm. There they found Indian glyphs and a few shelters,  deer tracks, one doe, “one rattlesnake, a few jackrabbits, rodents and lizards”  (Henderson, 145).  The Griffi ns themselves came into the area around 1878 or ’79 and raised  cattle and sheep until World War II, when they sold the sheep operation  because of a lack of shepherds.  “Me and two of my brothers bought a cattle outfi t down on the Fifty in  1969,” he tells me, “and we didn’t get out until the monument came in. The  BLM used the drought as an excuse to pull us off. We fed the cattle until all  our feed was gone, and the hay, and there was no more grass on the pasture,  and then we began to sell them.” “Did you get a good price?” I ask. “No.” So what does he think of the monument? “They wanted to designate it so that it would be protected, and it was  already protected.” Delane gives me his version of current events, the confl ict between his  son and the BLM that resulted in Quinn’s cattle being “net-gunned” by heli- copter off the Fifty, and the fi nal chapter, where Quinn had to hire a helicop- ter and a marksman to fi nish off the rest of his cattle, which were costing him  thousands of dollars in fi nes, and he gives me the full story of their neighbor,  Wild Cow Mary. As he tells it, after the BLM had rounded up her cattle and  some Griffi n cattle which had been grazing the same range, “They were go- ing to herd them through Kanab, but they knew the sheriff and the brand  inspector would be waiting for them, so they went around another route and  got the cattle to the auction in Salina, and when they got there, the auction- eer wouldn’t sell them and the brand inspector there, he said, ‘The evidence  I have is that the cattle belong to Mary Bullock and the Griffi ns; the BLM  can’t show ownership and I won’t have anything to do with them.’” Then things got interesting. Mary and a crowd of local cattlemen selling  their stock at the auction appropriated the cattle on the spot, loaded them in  their own trailers and drove them back to her ranch.  I ask whether there are any young people going into the cattle business. “No. In fact, there’s very few locals left in the business. A guy named  Sorenson has come in and bought out a lot of locals. Most of us use the  cattle business not as a livelihood but as a way to keep the family together,  so we can work together and have some place to call home. My wife was a  custodian at the church and I was a summer employee for the Forest Service,  working on the range crew from spring until winter.” </page> <page sequence="39"> 14 6     H i g hw ay  12 Most of the ranchers in Escalante and Boulder, I have come to fi nd out,  worked for the BLM or Forest Service at one point in their lives. “There’s still a lot of good people in both places,” Delane tells me, “but  they had a lot of pressure, especially when Clinton and Babbitt were in of- fi ce. Look how many monuments Clinton’s made, and I don’t think he’s  seen any of them. He might have fl own over this one but he never was here,  didn’t even have the guts to come up here.” Delane is touching on a bitter and divisive issue: the creation of the Grand  Staircase-Escalante National Monument. President Clinton set 1.7 million  acres aside for the new monument from the edge of the Grand Canyon on  September 18, 1996. Members of the environmental community and the  media were there with him, and a few celebrities were on hand but no Utah  representatives or senators. Representative Chris Cannon later spoke for the  entire Utah delegation: The fi rst time anyone in Utah, including my Democratic predecessor, ever  heard about the possibility of such an action (establishing the monument) was  in the pages of the Washington Post, a mere 11 days before the creation of  the monument. During the week before September 18, Utah’s congressional  delegation and Governor were told repeatedly that “nothing was imminent.”  (Subcommittee on National Parks, 21) That slight continues to cause animosity, but the declaration itself, the  “land grab,” as many in Utah put it, probably shouldn’t have come as a sur- prise. Back in the mid-thirties Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes pro- posed another Escalante Monument, this one 4.5 million acres, centered on  the confl uence of the Green and Colorado Rivers. The proposal was held  up by Utah politicians as well as local stockmen and miners and then it was  reduced to less than half its original planned size and fi nally fi nished off with  the United States’ entry into the Second World War (Richardson, 116). While the proposal still had life, Governor Blood lived in the perpetual  fear that “Some morning we may wake up and fi nd that . . . the Escalante  Monument has been created by Presidential Proclamation” (Richardson,  127).  Before such fears were confi rmed a full fi fty-six years later, however,  monuments were created all over southern Utah and turned into national  parks, and Capitol Reef, declared a monument in 1937 and a national park  in 1961, was expanded to six times its original size by President Lyndon  Johnson in 1969 (Frye, 1). As this was happening the boosters of the origi- nal monuments, the local mayors and representatives and county commis- sioners, grew silent, and the local stockmen grew more vehement in their </page> <page sequence="40"> Ha r d  R o a d s     14 7 opposition to the creation of new parks and monuments and wilderness ar- eas and the expansion of such entities, but by then it was too late. Blame the  environmentalists. “I’ll tell you what’s wrong with the environmentalists,” says Delane,  “They don’t know and they don’t know that they don’t know, and that’s  serious because they’ve got limited knowledge and they’re not willing to  listen. They’re always complaining about the condition of the range, and  what they think is that if you take the stock off the range, it will become a  Garden of Eden, but it won’t ’cause it’s a desert. It can’t look any better than  it does when it rains. In the spring the grass grows up and matures and that’s  as good as it gets.” “They’ve cut back logging here,” Thais says, “and it just makes you sick  because the forests are dying from the pine beetles, and once they catch  fi re, there’s no stopping it. One of our mills has been shut down and these  kids are struggling along. A lot of pioneers sacrifi ced everything they had  and even their lives when they came out here, and now it’s settled, and  now we’re told ‘we want this land for our children.’ Everything is for their  children.” There’s a picture of a line shack on the wall and it looks familiar. I get up  to take a look at it and it turns out to be a small house, neat, well-propor- tioned, nestled in a slickrock cove. I’ve seen other photographs of that house  in a book somewhere, but I can’t quite place it. There’s a news clip beneath  the photograph. “When did it burn down?” I ask. “About 1996,” says Delane. “It was the last one they burned. The Chris- tensons had one burnt before that and somebody else had a cabin and trailer  burnt on the same day. That cabin in the picture changed hands a few times.  It was a homestead in Cedar Wash and they numbered the logs and tore it  down and rebuilt it in Soda Gulch. There’s some red clay hills out there and  they gathered that up and plastered it in between the logs. My mother was  born in that house.” “Makes you wonder who you’re up against,” I say. “We know who we’re up against,” says Thais.  It’s time for me to go. “What’s your brand?” I ask Delane. “We haven’t got any cattle.” “What was your brand?” I ask, and he draws: “We didn’t have to do anything this summer,” he says. “Don’t have any  cattle and we ran out of water so we didn’t have to run the sprinklers.

We survive because we’re old enough to draw social  security.” “That big check really helps us out,” his wife says, though I detect sar- casm. “You go all these years and keep putting heifers back into the herd,  and in the meantime you’re buying, and then all of a sudden it’s all gone.  And that’s why we were rebuilding the herd, because that’s what we were  going to retire on.” “Then you two aren’t millionaire corporate ranchers, I take it.” They stare at me. “Do you miss that life?” I ask. “Some people like to ride in a brand new Cadillac,” says Delane, “and I feel  the same enjoyment on a real good horse. They talk about tourism helping us  out here and I can’t see where tourism, no matter how many come through  here, is going to benefi t me. Somebody suggested I build a bed and break- fast”—and here he looks incredulous—“a bed and breakfast. Where would I  get that kind of money? We’re not living here because we’re rich; we’re living  here to get away from the city and raise our kids up where they’re free to go  any direction they want, and they love the outdoors and when they go to col- lege and get married, then they have to go somewhere else.” Kim Keefe is the soft-spoken secretary-treasurer of the New Escalante Ir- rigation Company and McKay Bailey is a big, retired local rancher with half  a fi nger missing from his right hand and one fi nger crooked as a cottonwood  </page> <page sequence="42"> Ha r d  R o a d s     14 9 branch on his left, and the day after I meet with the Griffi ns, the two have  agreed to take me out to the proposed site of the new reservoir which the  town has been trying to get approved for ten years. I meet them in the morn- ing at Kim’s tiny offi ce in the middle of town, and we make small talk about  Patrick Diehl and Tori Woodard, whose organization, the Escalante Wilder- ness Project (EWP), has joined with the Sierra Club and SUWA in appealing  to the Interior Department’s Internal Bureau of Land Appeals (IBLA) the  BLM’s decision to go ahead with the new reservoir. McKay and Kim don’t  have a very high opinion of the pair, and neither do most other people in town.  Kim tells me, “Diehl is a strange person. He won’t listen to anything anybody  else has to say.” And McKay says, “I met him once at the general store and I  told him ‘this town ain’t big enough for the two of us. I’m leaving.’” Kim worked for the Forest Service for twenty years and understood com- ing into the job what was involved in getting a project like the Wide Hollow  Reservoir approved, but lately the obstacles have grown. Environmentalists  are holding up fi nal approval by raising issues that were addressed in the en- vironmental assessments, but such concerns over the impacts to the land and  the wildlife can be recast again and again in modifi ed forms in each successive Kim Keefe and McKay Bailey at the site of the proposed Wide Hollow Reservoir </page> <page sequence="43"> 15 0     H i g hw ay  12 Photo of Steve Gessig’s property by Brittany, a fourth grader from the Children’s  Media Workshop. appeal, and each time the irrigation company has to spend more money to  clarify matters and restate their case to bureaucrats who are new to the situa- tion.  The proposed reservoir site was initially outside the wilderness boundar- ies the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance was recommending to Congress,  and SUWA expanded those boundaries to include it. Diehl said the reservoir  would siphon too much water from the Escalante River, though the districts’  water rights entitle it to every drop the new reservoir would hold. SUWA is  appealing the latest approval from the BLM on the grounds that the BLM  has not proven that the proposed reservoir wouldn’t severely damage the  ecology of North and Birch Creeks.  “The environmentalists are also using the Southwestern willow fl ycatch- er to hold things up, and a few other wildlife species, because Wide Hol- low is a potential habitat site,” says Kim, “and I think they want to get us  on the riparian areas. What bothers us is the litigation we’re going to face  when the IBLA fi nally approves the project. NEPA is the problem. It was </page> <page sequence="44"> Ha r d  R o a d s     151 Photo by Lucas Schulkoski, from the Children’s Media Workshop. originally designed to mitigate impacts on the environment and it’s turned  into a nightmare of paperwork and legal battles.” The willow fl ycatcher, by the way, is a six-inch-long light-green and white  passerine bird and dweller of thickets on the banks of streams. It joined  the Mexican spotted owl, the Kanab ambersnail, the Utah prairie dog and  the Kodachrome bladderpod as an offi cially endangered species in 1995.  It’s numbers may or may not be dwindling because of an insidious pest: the  brown-headed cowbird, itself a declining species, which lays its eggs in the  nests of other birds like the willow fl ycatcher and lets them raise its young.  The cowbird used to feed on insects kicked up by bison, but now they follow  cattle, and that has greatly increased their range. Other objections to the reservoir focus on the BLM’s supposed failure to  address alternatives with less impact to the environment. </page> <page sequence="45"> 15 2     H i g hw ay  12 “The [existing] reservoir has been silting in since it was built,” says Keefe,  “and every conceivable alternative to solve that problem has been studied over  the last twenty years. Dredging was one of the things we considered but it  would have been very expensive and we would have to haul the dredged mate- rial somewhere else, and it would have required a lot of water to carry out, and  it wouldn’t solve the problem in the long run. We could also have raised the  dam, but it would have fl ooded Escalante State Park, and the state put the ex- isting dam on their ‘high hazard list’; it’s not safe, and we’d have to rehabilitate  it, which would cost too much and leave us with the original problem.” According to the district’s literature, a study by the state found that the  present dam “was not capable of passing Probable Maximum Flood (PMF)  without overtopping.” Further studies by a private fi rm indicated that it “did  not satisfy Utah State Engineer Criteria for seismic stability.” This is of interest to me because dams have a habit of breaking in these  parts. One of the most spectacular failures occurred at Spectacle Lake above  Salt Gulch back on May 29, 1938. Irene King-Ence records: Mary Moosman called me. “The reservoir dam has broken!” she said excit- edly. “I can see a very big stream of water coming off the top of the mountain.  Let everyone know.”. . . We hurried to the pickup and drove over to Boulder,  stopping on the Salt Gulch side of Boulder Creek. I said, “Just to be safe, we’ll  stop up here on the rocks.” . . . Arthur Alvey was talking about the bridge. He  pointed to the bolts, about two inches thick, and said, “I don’t think any fl ood  will move this bridge.” . . . I took the girls up to the truck, wondering if it would  be all day. I looked up the creek, then started screaming as I’d never screamed  before in my life. I was petrifi ed. I could suddenly see the front of the water  coming, the trees and everything it was taking in front of it. There was a wall  of debris fi fty feet high. As it came, everything went over. . . . We all watched  as the water hit the bridge below. It fl ew into the air like so many match sticks  fl ipped away. Then the roar hit. We couldn’t hear anything. (King-Ence 270- 271) Rehabilitating the present Wide Hollow dam to the point where it would  be safe would cost three million dollars.  We get into McKay’s ’79 Ford pickup with his two faithful mutts, Fred  and Barney, in the bed and ride out to the old earth dam below Escalante  State Park, where dinosaur bones and conifers lapidifi ed into agate have  emerged from the bentonitic mudstones. From above, the dam looks sturdy  enough. I expect to see a puddle on the other side, but it looks about half  full, and that’s half of half. When the dam was built in the late fi fties, it held  twenty-four hundred acre-feet of water and now it holds twelve hundred,  and that drops every year.  </page> <page sequence="46"> Ha r d  R o a d s     15 3 “The reservoir fi lls up in the late fall and winter,” says Keefe, “and then  the rest of our allotment fl ows down river. Last year the reservoir was empty  by June 28, and water didn’t fl ow for another forty-four days. When that  happens, people start using the town’s spring-fed culinary system to water  their lawns and their gardens, and this strains our culinary supply until we  have to start rationing in order to reserve enough water to meet city fi re  codes.” We drive up the canyon, through ranchlands and fi elds of alfalfa. I ask  Kim what kind of harvest they had this year. “Normally farmers can get three or four crops of alfalfa, and this year  they were able to get about one and a half.” I ask her why environmentalists were trying so hard to stop the dam. “They don’t want any reservoirs or any kind of construction on pub- lic land,” she says. “The Glen Canyon branch of the Sierra Club has been  fi ghting to drain Lake Powell. So they do what they need to do to get this  reservoir stopped. They appeal it; they criticize the document. And it will  never end until we have to abandon the project because it’s too expensive. It  sounds terrible but that’s what they’re doing, delaying it and delaying it until  it costs us so much money we can’t go on.” Already, the cost of the originally planned reservoir has risen over $3  million to $10.7 million, not counting the money the water conservancy dis- trict has had to spend justifying the project, and to stay within their budget  they’ve reduced the reservoir’s size from sixty-one hundred to thirty-fi ve  hundred acre-feet. “How long is it going to take for the IBLA to return a decision?” I ask. “It takes one and a half years to two years for an appeal to even get to the  IBLA,” says Kim, “and we can’t wait that long. This drought has been pretty  rough on the farmers and the reservoir really affects them. Opponents of the  project have no sympathy for them either. They want to know why they are  farming in the desert anyway. The farmers don’t want people to feel sorry  for them; they just want to continue farming what they farm best in this type  of country, which is alfalfa.” I mention something Wallace Stegner had written about water being the  economic substrate of the West. It’s an old cliché but it’s absolutely true:  whoever controls the water controls the West. “You haven’t got much if you haven’t got water,” McKay agrees. “That’s  a fact.” We come up on an arroyo at the mouth of the hollow, the dam site, and  McKay parks and we have a look around. The plan is to employ a rock  slope as part of the dam structure. The earth beneath the arroyo would  have to be excavated until they reached bedrock. I try to imagine where the  </page> <page sequence="47"> 15 4     H i g hw ay  12 waterline would be and what the reservoir would look like. Even by west- ern standards, the reservoir won’t be that large, 227 acres, but the hollow  before me, the sagebrush plain and the arroyos cut into it and the low hills  will be sunk. “Real pretty country you’ve got here,” I say. “Yeah,” McKay drawls. “As soon as we learn how to eat these rocks, we’ll  be set.” The Infamous Louise Liston Louise Liston and her husband sold their BLM and Forest Service permits  and now they raise quarter horses with roping blood lines on their ranch.  Their brand is:  Louise was a Garfi eld County commissioner back in the eighties and  nineties, and she was closely involved in a number of local battles over roads  and wilderness, which culminated in President Clinton’s designation of the  land around Escalante as a national monument. I met her at her family’s  ranch house on the outskirts of town after I went out to see the dam site, and  she agreed to talk to me even though she had a cold and a bad cough. She  sat on the couch against her big front window and I sat across from her and  she was backlit; I couldn’t see her expressions unless I squinted. When she’d  answered the door, though, I’d met a middle-aged woman with bright eyes  and a half-smile on her lips, and I don’t think that smile ever leaves her face  except for brief moments because I can always hear it in her voice. It’s not  a mask, a politician’s smirk; it’s a genuine smile that involves her whole de- meanor. It’s the way she does business; she could keep the same dreamy tone  of voice, the same pleasant smile while telling you that you’re dead wrong  and she’s going to do everything in her power to stop you in your tracks. Louise’s voice is also tinged with a weariness which is only partly due to  a cold, but as she speaks, she rapidly rallies, and she leans forward for em- phasis, and then she falls back again because really, there’s wasn’t much she  could do about the situation even when she was in offi ce. I start off by tell- ing her I think it will be at least ten years before the Interior Board of Land  Appeals and the courts have fi nished reviewing the Sierra Club and SUWA’s  objections to the Wide Hollow Reservoir and construction can begin. “Escalante’s ranchers and farmers won’t be here in ten years,” she tells  me, “It’ll be another Escalante. We can’t survive that long. We’ve had a lot  of liquidation this year because of the drought, and you can’t begin to pay  your assessment for your water taxes on one crop of hay.  Louise reiterates the problems the town has faced on the reservoir, how  environmental groups like SUWA wanted the BLM to conduct a “full- </page> <page sequence="48"> Ha r d  R o a d s     15 5 blown” environmental impact statement after three environmental assess- ments and then there would be more appeals to the IBLA and lawsuits, so I  revise my estimate up a bit.  “It would take a hundred years,” I say. “It’s really frustrating and it’s such a simple project that could save a whole  town and valley, keep open space, because when the ranchers sell out it’s go- ing to become tourist-oriented like Moab, though maybe not as big because  we don’t have as much water. “I was involved in the Andalex Coal project in the monument and they  have some mines over in Emery and Carbon Counties and they said, ‘those  mines are short-lived.’ And what are we going to do when those mines are  gone? We have in the monument the largest fi eld of low-sulfur, non-pollut- ing coal in the nation, maybe the whole world, and it’s gone because of that  proclamation and it would have been our salvation.” She goes on about the double-edged sword of tourism for a while but it’s  all summed up, showing the prevailing attitude as well, in the statement she  gave before Congress on April 29, 1997: Our young people in rural areas feel that the freedoms guaranteed them by the  Constitution are being violated more and more by Federal restrictions, regula- tions and designations. . . . Over 98 percent of my county is State and federally  owned. With a meager 1.3 percent of the county’s land base left to generate  taxes from a population of 4,000, we are caring for over 3 million visitors. . . .  we will handle their waste, provide law enforcement services, emergency ser- vices, search-and-rescue, try their criminal cases in our Courts, and maintain  safe roads for them to travel on to recreate on the nation’s public lands, all on  a very limited budget that is further eroded away by the loss of taxes generated  by stable industries that no longer exist. We in the West are tired of having our destiny decided by greedy preser- vationists and a Congress sympathetic to their cries of wolf. We take offense  when accused of abusing the land and destroying its beauty, when, indeed, we  have been such caring stewards that the land is now beautiful enough to be  declared a “national treasure.” (Subcommittee on National Parks,151-154) I ask her about the fi ght to pave part of the Burr Trail. “We actually received a court decision which said the Burr Trail belonged  to us and we walked outside and our attorney said to SUWA’s director, ‘well,  we won that one’ and she said ‘Delay is our victory and we’ll delay you all  the way.’ In one way or another delay is their victory. That’s what they’re  doing with the reservoir, the delay tactic. In the last four years the cost of the  reservoir has gone up over two million dollars because of all the delays and  appeals from environmentalists so we have to do everything over and over,  </page> <page sequence="49"> 15 6     H i g hw ay  12 and fi nally you just give up because you don’t have the money to fi ght it and  you don’t see an end to it.” I come back to the reservoir. There’s been a break in the town’s main wa- ter line and the town’s water supply has been shut off. School was cancelled.  Louise points to the row of bottles and jugs on the counter she fi lled before  the supply was stopped.  “We have to shut down the whole town,” she says. “You know we love this  western fl avor, and rural towns depend on the land for a living, and if you take  away the land, you’re going to lose that fl avor and the open space is going to  fi ll up with growth and development. It’s inevitable. It happens all over, and  that’s what we want to prevent. That’s the reason for the reservoir, so we can  preserve the agricultural lifestyle, the farming and ranching and cowboys and  the western fl avor that people come here to experience in the fi rst place.” Louise has said some unkind things about the politicians in Washington  in the past. “Did you ever meet Al Gore or Bruce Babbitt?” I ask. She leans  forward into the house’s light and she’s beaming and she starts laughing. “There was a hearing and I was testifying and Babbitt came in and some- one said, ‘Why don’t you go up and introduce yourself?’ And I said, ‘Oh,  I don’t think that would be a good idea,’ and he said ‘Oh, go on,’ and I  thought ‘O.K., maybe he needs to know who I am because I know he’s heard  a lot about me.’ So I went up to him and said, ‘Secretary Babbitt, I thought  maybe I’d introduce myself. I’m Commissioner Louise Liston,’ and he said,  ‘Ah, the famous Louise Liston!’ And I said, ‘Probably the infamous Louise  Liston to you!’” The Environmentalists That night I’m on the porch of the person who calls himself “the most hated  man in Escalante.” The man who answers the door is taller than me and I’m  six feet; he’s in his fi fties, balding, but what hair he has is encomic and long in  back and unkempt. He’s wearing jeans and tennis shoes and a kind of striped  shirt that’s been out of style since the sixties. He’s a big man, not heavy, but  he has a large frame, a square jaw. He’s intimidating, a cross between Henry  Fonda and—he’d dislike this visual comparison but it’s true—Clint Eastwood.  This is Patrick Diehl, environmentalist and doctor of comparative literature.  He invites me into the living room, which is taken up by chairs and a  desk, a rack full of cassette tapes, maybe one hundred of them or more, and  a piano, and he introduces me to his partner of the last seventeen years, Tori  Woodard, who wears thick-framed glasses and parts her long straight hair  down the middle. Tori was raised on a cattle ranch in Colorado and moved  to southern California at some point and met Patrick through an anti-nu- </page> <page sequence="50"> Ha r d  R o a d s     15 7 clear weapons organization at Berkeley. Patrick Diehl was born in Texas  and raised in Tennessee and he also spent some time on a cattle ranch in his  childhood. He received his bachelor’s degree from Harvard, got a fellowship  to study in Paris, got a full career fellowship and his Ph.D. at U.C. Berkeley  and took a second bachelor’s degree at Oxford as a Marshall scholar. He’s  written two books, Dante’s Rime (Princeton University Press) and The Medi- eval Religious Lyric (University of California Press). He was an acting assis- tant professor at Berkeley, taught there for about eight years and didn’t get  tenure and then he “went straight into the anti-nuclear movement.” They met in ’82 and their relationship became serious in ’85, and then  Tori developed multiple chemical sensitivity, a type of environmental illness,  a chronic, elevated immune response to low levels of perfumes, pesticides,  detergents and other inorganic, and sometimes even organic, compounds.  She didn’t necessarily get MCS from the smog in southern California or  from exposure to any particular toxic chemical, as often happens, but it was  something in the urban environment, and they had to get out of that part  of the world, to the high desert where particulate levels were much lower.  They settled on Escalante because it’s fi fty-seven hundred feet high and be- cause, as Tori says, “Patrick loves this area.” Tori keeps an electric air fi lter going at her feet throughout the interview.  They’ve just come back from a trip down Davis Canyon and they didn’t see  one jackrabbit on the way, not one coyote, “and the place,” Tori tells me,  “should be crawling with coyotes.” Patrick is the vice-chairperson of the Sierra Club’s Glen Canyon Group,  whose primary goal is to drain Lake Powell, and Tori is the chairperson of  the GCG’s nuclear waste and conservation divisions. They and three other  people also make up the fi ve board members of the non-profi t Escalante  Wilderness Project, and as far as I can tell, its board members are its only  members. This group of fi ve people has been partly responsible for bringing  a number of projects in and around Escalante to a complete halt through  lawsuits and appeals to the Interior Department’s Board of Appeals based on  discrepancies in the BLM’s environmental impact statements and environ- mental assessments, and one of those projects is the Wide Hollow Reservoir.  One of the aims of the EWP is to end grazing on public lands.  “The viewpoint the people in town have is the Mormons moved in here,  they built the roads, created the town and made their living off grazing sheep  and cattle and now they’re being told they can’t continue that lifestyle—,”  I start. “They’re not making a living off that, though,” says Patrick, “The statis- tics show that agricultural income is a minus fi gure.”  </page> <page sequence="51"> 15 8     H i g hw ay  12 “I’d like to address grazing,” says Tori. “I grew up on a ranch, so when I  moved here I wasn’t particularly down on grazing. Patrick had a more criti- cal view of grazing. In fact, when we fi rst moved here I helped bring the  Grand Canyon Trust here to meet with ranchers, and they met with them,  cash in hand, to keep the land from being developed. So that’s how I felt.  And the local people seemed to think that was probably a communist plot.  There had to be something really fi shy with handing over any rights to your  land. They didn’t like that and they ended up not liking me. And that’s when  I started to change my view. As far as the question of grazing cows on public  land, I don’t think we should have any cows on public land. They overgrazed  initially and they all know that. They ran way too many sheep here and they  started grazing cows, and they [the BLM] cut [grazing] down and cut it  down, and I feel like, yeah, you could probably support a few, like enough to  feed the people, but not enough to export. Yeah, it wouldn’t hurt you to have  whatever it would take, maybe twenty-fi ve cows running around to feed this  place, but not more. They ignore all the scientifi c literature. Grazing is no  longer viable; it’s just not possible, and I feel like no one’s to blame for what  happened because they didn’t know.” “How long,” I ask them, “will it take the range to recover from the dam- age?” “Never,” says Patrick, “We’re talking about centuries, with a lot of invest- ment. The riparian zones would recover to some extent, but when you’ve got  thirty-fi ve foot deep arroyos, you’re talking about a long time scale. We’re  talking about four or fi ve feet of soil. If you look at the uplands, the shrubs  are on little pedestals, and that’s because the soil has been taken out around  them. The diversity decreases. The bunchgrasses get extra attention by the  cows. They’ve been eaten down to the roots. The damage is permanent  enough; I certainly don’t expect to see much improvement in my lifetime.  Sometimes, where there’s water, though, where cattle have been excluded,  recovery can happen in fi ve years.” This is one of the reasons they oppose the Wide Hollow Reservoir. A lot  of water runs past the present reservoir, and Patrick and Tori believe that de- forestation of the surrounding slopes by ranchers and the timber industry is  mostly to blame. Less ground cover translates into more water moving faster  downstream. Microbiotic crust, Tori says, “soaks the moisture right up. You  can watch it,” and this soil has been severely trampled by cows. We talk about the old roads in the monument and the national parks. I try  to introduce the idea of freedom of travel into the conversation but the Doc- tor, a member of the ACLU, will have none of it. “The constitution doesn’t  say anything about freedom of travel,” he says, and our discussion moves along  </page> <page sequence="52"> Ha r d  R o a d s     15 9 the lines of what’s legal, and at one point Tori indicates she doesn’t have much  of a problem with allowing people to use the old roads in the monument. “But that would allow people to just go wherever they want,” says the  Doctor, and he asks my opinion about the point of the controversy, about  why the county and state are trying to claim so many cattle trails and deer  trails and old four-wheel drive roads as “highways” or “roads.” “Well, part of it is to hold up the process of creating wilderness.” “Exactly,” Patrick says, “and the courts don’t look kindly on that sort of  thing, using a pretext like that to stop another process.” The conversation turns to Highway 12. I tell them about a trip I took  with Wade Barney, who does maintenance on Highway 12, about the Hog- back between Escalante and Boulder and the only way to widen it being to  dig down fi fteen feet. There are few fatalities, we all agree, for such a narrow  and apparently dangerous road. “I like it that way,” Tori tells me. “I don’t want it any wider. It’s one of  those nice old narrow highways that twists and winds; you’re close to nature;  you can interact with it. I’m an environmentalist that loves this highway. I  want them to keep it nice and smooth, no pot holes, lots of money for them  to keep it in good shape, just like it is. They’re going to get a lot of money  now that it’s an All-American Road. What are they going to do with all the  money?” “Put in sidings,” I venture. I don’t really know. “We’d like to see more educational signs along the Highway 12 corridor,”  says Patrick. “Maybe people will get some more information, maybe slow  down a little and get to spend some time in Escalante and Boulder.”  We talk about mining. Tori objects to me using the term “locked up”  when referring to the extractable resources surrounding Escalante.  “Ten to fi fteen percent of the monument is covered by mining claims,”  says Patrick. “But nobody can stake any new mining claims,” I reply. “No.” Andalex sold its claim on the coal beneath the Kaiparowits Plateau for about  fourteen million dollars after the monument’s creation, Tori reminds me. The Doctor says that Ruby’s Inn, next to Bryce Canyon, is now the single  largest employer in Garfi eld County, outside of the federal government. I  tell them I think most of the cowboys here probably don’t want to wait on  tables or work in convenience stores or clean toilets for a living and the Doc- tor has a ready answer: “They’ll have their wives and girlfriends do that for  them,” his point being that small-scale ranching in the West, right now, is  so unprofi table that many of the local families look at it more as a hobby or  </page> <page sequence="53"> 16 0     H i g hw ay  12 lifestyle than an occupation. Often the wife has to make ends meet working  a service job or two in town. Patrick and Tori moved here about the time the monument engulfed Es- calante but the two were welcomed nonetheless and some of the ranchers  even helped them unload their furniture from the moving van. Patrick, who  has had some acting experience and who is a classically trained musician,  got involved with the church choir and the local drama club. Then they  wrote an editorial that was critical of the proposed Wide Hollow Reservoir  in the Salt Lake Tribune, and the Sierra Club picked up on it and got a court  injunction to halt construction until further environmental studies could be  completed, and that nixed a deal between the New Escalante Water District  and the National Guard, which was loaning them a few hundred men and  some equipment to help with the initial construction. According to Patrick  and Tori, the deal wasn’t legal to begin with, but regardless, the water dis- trict lost several hundred thousand dollars and the two were warned they’d  “better get their Kevlar vests.” Not long after Patrick and Tori initiated the process which shut down  construction of the new reservoir, somebody opened the water valve in their  backyard and thirty-two thousand gallons of water spilled out, ruining the  excavation for a studio Patrick and his son were going to build.  “You know,” I told them, laughing, “that’s actually pretty clever. And it  shows some restraint.” But Patrick and Tori don’t think it was funny, and neither did the water  board, which accused them of opening the valve themselves as a “publicity  stunt” and fi ned them $1,150. They fought the fi ne and lost—according to  Tori, the judge “sneered” at them—and then they appealed that ruling and  won. The suit and the appeal cost them a great deal more than the fi ne, but  Diehl says “it was a matter of principle.” It took them a long time and a lot of hassles to get their water hooked  back up. Meantime, somebody broke into their house while they were away  and trashed it and somebody smashed their car’s windshield. Somebody  called Tori in the middle of the night and told her “I wouldn’t sleep too  sound if I was you.” Bob Walton of Salt Lake City is a representative of the Utah Wilderness  Coalition and a friend of theirs. At a BLM hearing in the high school, ac- cording to Patrick, a cowboy grabbed bumper stickers and pamphlets off the  table Bob had set up and out of his hands and shredded them with a bowie  knife. More cowboys gathered around him and threatened Bob’s life—one  of them said “We ought to kill you,” according to Walton—and Tori and  Patrick had to help escort him away. </page> <page sequence="54"> Ha r d  R o a d s     161 Diehl was handcuffed during an anti-wilderness gathering where one  speaker, a bishop in the LDS church, likened the battle with environmental- ism to a “religious war.” Later, he was told the handcuffs were for his own  protection. Throughout all of this their only friend was Sheriff Monte Luker who, most  people agree, later lost his job for standing up for them and protecting them. The Doctor was involved for years with the “Escalante Center,” a planned  local interpretive center and a staging point for geological, archaeological,  ecological and paleontological studies in the monument. Louise Liston’s  son-in-law, Quinn Griffi n, the guy who had to shoot some of his own cattle  last season because he couldn’t get them off the Fifty, took over the director- ship of the center. “That must be kind of galling,” I say. “It’s been very interesting,” says Patrick, “It actually got co-opted. It  started out state-driven. The Escalante Center was supposed to be an art  center, science center, museum, visitors center, something for everyone— they allocated ten million dollars—and it’s evolved into something that’s not  the original concept. I’m on the board of the Escalante Canyons Center for  Arts and Humanities and we were a partner in the center originally and our  group was thrown out of the partnership because I was on the board. ‘Thou  shalt not suffer an environmentalist to be part of your organization.’ That  was quite a dramatic moment. They expelled our representatives and two  months later they had it back together minus our organization.” “Was it rational for you to move here?” I ask them.  “Are you asking if it was safe?” says Tori. “Both.” “We came here for my health. It’s a high desert, and Patrick loves this  place. And the garden out back is starting to produce. Why don’t they (the  people of Escalante) leave?” “They are leaving.” Patrick nods, “Escalante has a long history of that, young people leaving  town.” That doesn’t surprise Tori. “Their basic philosophy is to go out and mul- tiply and subdue the earth,” she says.  They give me examples of taciturn locals treating visitors rudely and a list  of the worst offenders. I can add from personal experience that if you look  like an environmentalist in Escalante, you will probably be mistreated. “I’d like to put a rumor to rest,” I tell Patrick. “I’ve been told that you  had a hiking accident out in the monument and the people of Escalante had  to rescue you.” </page> <page sequence="55"> 16 2     H i g hw ay  12 “I went over a cliff in Phipps Wash in ’97 and broke my pelvis in two plac- es and my left forearm, the ulna. I lay there for thirty hours, and Tori tried  to convince the search and rescue commander to just go down the route that  I went down. She knew where I was. If they’d done that they would have  found me real fast. They had a plane out there and I saw it go by four times.  I was in the shadows and I wasn’t very mobile with my pelvis broken in two  places, so I couldn’t make myself visible. I’m lying there, the plane is fl ying  by and you know, I was wondering ‘why don’t they come down to the rock  above me?’”  “The BLM guys couldn’t go against what the commander of the search  and rescue said,” Tori tells us, “so we all got together down by the Escalante  River to see if they’d found Patrick and nobody had so the commander of  the thing went home.” As it turns out, the search and rescue commander, had been up all of the  previous night, and there was some sort of miscommunication between him  and Tori. When he called off the search, the BLM members kept going on  their own, following Tori’s advice this time, and they found Diehl a quarter- mile down the trail. “What were you thinking for those thirty hours?” I ask. “He was doing pain management,” says Tori. “I fi gured Tori would get people to the right place eventually,” says the  Doctor. “That’s what I was thinking.” “You didn’t have any religious experiences?” “Oh good Lord no.” “They normally wait twenty-four hours after a call has been made to be- gin the search,” says Tori, “but Monte Luker, our friend the sheriff, decided  he was going to initiate the search that day. He believed there was something  wrong, and there was a storm coming.” “I was lying right there with a cliff above me,” Diehl tells me, “and I  was right where a couple slopes came together, so that afternoon, as I was  waiting to be rescued, I was trying to move myself out of the bottom of this  gully, and I’d managed to move about a foot up through soft sand at the cost  of extreme pain, because I could smell the rain coming and it was going to  come right over that cliff. I’d already been out there a day and exposure was  a real problem. So anyway, and I don’t want to be nasty about it, but I don’t  see myself as having been rescued by the people of Escalante. I was rescued  by some BLM employees who fi nally were able to do their jobs when they  ceased being ordered around by somebody who’d jumped to conclusions  about where to look.” Later, Patrick and Tori set up an information booth and handed out  literature on the environmental consequences of grazing next to the steps  </page> <page sequence="56"> Ha r d  R o a d s     16 3 of the BLM’s Interagency Center. The BLM wanted them outside a certain  radius from the front door and suggested they put their stand next to a  maintenance shed at the far end of the parking lot. Tori was cited for plac- ing the booth too close to the front door and then Patrick was cited and  hauled away.  “I started a hunger strike in Purgatory Jail, over by St. George, and  they freaked,” says Diehl. “The press was all over it. I couldn’t believe how  much attention this thing got. You know, just a little minor civil disobedi- ence.” Says Tori, “They let him go right away. [BLM law enforcement offi cer]  Larry Vensel said to Patrick, ‘This is how you’re thanking me for rescuing you.’  Larry rescued him and Patrick said, ‘I would have done the same for you.’” “If they (the locals) had rescued you, would you have felt differently?” I  ask. The Doctor has to think about that for a moment. “Not really,” he fi nally  says. “I would do the same thing for any human being in my position. In fact,  I tried to be on the search and rescue team so I could do the same for other  people, but . . . ahhrrgg.” The long and short of it is that they didn’t want him on the search and  rescue team. I hint at another rumor as I leave; that although they had helped bring the  construction of the Wide Hollow Reservoir to a stop because they thought  it might lead to developments other than alfalfa fi elds, the two were in fact  planning their own fi fty-home development somewhere on the edge of Escalante. At the end of a conversation about Patrick’s run for Utah’s Second  Congressional District on the Green Party ticket (he got 1.3 percent of the  vote), I allude to the rumor in a sideways manner: “One thing I think you  and me and the people of Escalante could agree on,” I say, “is that we don’t  want Escalante to be developed.” They don’t bite. I tell them I think all the locals want is to be left alone,  and Diehl says, “That’s not going to happen.” They encourage me to move  down to Escalante so the town could have at least three points of view.  The Timber Baron Imagine the look on a guy sitting on a thousand-pound bull that’s just stomped  its last rider to death and you will see the look on Stephen Steed’s face. His  teeth clench in a nervous smile, his eyebrows arch, his head tilts down a bit  and he looks past me once in a while to where the sky would be, like he wants  to see some patch of sunlight before they open the rodeo pen doors. Stephen Steed is manager of the Skyline Forest Resources sawmill at the  edge of Escalante, but just barely. A few months back, the operation looked  </page> <page sequence="57"> 16 4     H i g hw ay  12 doomed: it was hemorrhaging money and the owners were going to shut it  down and they’d already started laying the workers off. But Stephen and his  brothers begged, borrowed and fi nagled enough cash and credit to buy the  owners out, and here he is, in his own offi ce where the sounds of the yard are  still clear, sitting on that bull that’s ready to stick a horn in his gut.  I’ve seen that look before. I saw it on local cowboy Dell LeFevre’s face  when I spoke to him on his ranch, but only for a moment because he actually  did ride bulls in his younger days and he’s the sort of nut who’ll wager his  own money and up the stakes when he gets on a bull like that and leave the  rest to God. And I see it on the face of my father, CEO of a wire-rope mill in  Pennsylvania, every time I ask him how business is going. There are a lot of  entrepreneurs and executives in the manufacturing sector of this country who  are putting in sixteen-hour days and feeling lucky—not good but lucky—if  their operations break even. I don’t pity them: they’re adrenaline junkies and  they got on the bull themselves, but I don’t envy them either because their  work beats them to pieces even if they do go the full eight seconds. Stephen doesn’t have much time to talk and he gives me the abbreviated  version of the mill’s history: His family has been in the logging business for  four generations. His father built Escalante’s other sawmill in 1958 and it  burned in 1975, two years after his father died, and they rebuilt it and it was  bought by Allied Forest Products and then Kaibab Forest Industries, which  closed it to keep their operation in Panguitch going, but that mill died too  and so did another one in Fredonia, just south of Kanab, and about four  hundred people lost high-paying jobs around here in the early and mid- nineties. About that time Stephen and some partners got a few loans and  grants together and bought this mill, which used to compete with his father’s,  and brought it back from the grave and gathered some equipment from the  other mills at discount prices and hired a few people who’d been laid off and  went back into business processing salvage timber for the Forest Service.  The mill was bought by Bighorn Lumber out of Laramie, Wyoming, which  kept him on as manager but also made a business decision to shut the mill  down again in 2001, and that’s when he and his brothers bought the mill  back.  Salt Lake City’s Eyewitness News (July 24, 2002) covered the mill’s rebirth.  Here’s a few lines.  John Hollenhorst: Stephen Steed pretty much presided over the funeral of the plant  last winter. The sawmill was losing money. Shutting down. Fifty people out of  work. Now, in a summer surprise, they’re all going back to work. Stephen Steed: Yes, hah, hah. I am surprised. JH:  The brothers may be surprised the deal came together, but some workers  aren’t. </page> <page sequence="58"> Ha r d  R o a d s     16 5 Mark Lison, sawmill mechanic: They’re really down to earth, and what they say they’re  gonna do, they do. JH:  And they did. ML:  And they did! Hah, hah hah. Since then they’ve purchased a micro mill to process specialty products  and they’ve concentrated on niche markets to pay the bills: vigas, beams for  Navajo hogans, rails, shakes, pet-litter shavings, landscaping mulch. “What’s responsible for the slump in the timber industry?” I ask.  “Lower labor costs and less regulation in other countries, a strong dollar.  You can ship fi nished wood in from Europe, Canada, Australia and South  America cheaper than you can buy it here,” he says, and then he gets that  nervous smile and he watches me like he’s thinking I’m going to jump over  the desk and try to throttle him over what he says next: “And Eric, the en- vironmental movement has played a role as well, and NEPA. There have  been excesses in the past we’re not proud of. There’s been overgrazing,  nobody denies that, and there are roads in places we don’t need roads. If  we weren’t willing to learn from our mistakes and change our ways maybe  we shouldn’t be here, but we love this place and if we didn’t we wouldn’t  be here.” As it turns out, the Mexican spotted owl also inhabits the forests around  Escalante, as do many other endangered species, and that means the BLM  and the Forest Service have to complete huge environmental assessments  before a single sapling can be cut. The logging Steed’s contractors are doing  on Griffi n Top required nine fi le boxes of paperwork, and while the govern- ment processes its EAs and EISs, some nearby forests are being decimated  by spruce beetles.  “Have you seen Cedar Mountain?” he asks. “The trees are dead. We  could have stopped the spruce beetle infestation at its inception but now it’s  an epidemic, and now the Forest Service wants to cut down all the infected  trees on that mountain. It will be thirty or forty years before commercial  harvesting can begin again.” That’s bad planning or bad luck, but the timber industry got some per- versely good luck lately when the West caught fi re. In 2000, fi res burned  about 8.5 million acres of forests in the U.S., an area bigger than Maryland,  much of which had been set off limits to loggers by environmental lawsuits.  Whether the fi res could have been prevented by logging is still up to debate,  but many western politicians made that assumption and the Interior Depart- ment began to let out more thinning contracts. “The Kaibab Fire,” says Steed, “was 450,000 acres. Now we’ve got a con- tract to cut diseased trees down there.”  </page> <page sequence="59"> 16 6     H i g hw ay  12 We’re joined by Steed’s imposing top machinist, Wally Veater, the man  who keeps the mill’s saws sharp, who commutes all the way from Panguitch  on the other side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. He agrees with his boss on  what caused the mill there to close, and he tells me about an environmental  group called Friends of the Dixie who lived in and around Dixie National  Forest, who saw it as their mission to protect the Dixie from logging and  other abuses. “Now they are surrounded by dead spruce,” says Wally, “and nobody  wants to buy their houses because they can’t get fi re insurance, hah, hah. “Up in Brian Head, you used to have to get a permit to cut a tree on your  own property, and then their trees were infected with spruce beetles. Now, if  you fi nd a tree that’s infected, you’ll be fi ned if you don’t cut it down.” Skyline Forest Resources only employs about sixty workers but that still  makes it the largest employer in Escalante, and these aren’t service industry  jobs. Steed also keeps a lot of logging contractors working. “We contribute about seven million dollars to Garfi eld County’s econo- my,” he says. “I know a guy who lost his job at the mill, and he and his wife  went to work for Ruby’s Inn, and the two of them together don’t make as  much as he was earning alone at the mill.” What does the future hold for Skyline Forest Resources? Stephen sees  the economics and public opinion coming around.  “Things will cycle,” he says. “Right now people like Patrick Diehl and  Tori Woodard have control, but the environmentalists aren’t just trying to  keep the locals out of the forests and parks, they’re trying to keep the public  out, and people will begin to realize that.” Does he believe Patrick and Tori are going to give up? “Escalante will be here long after they’re gone,” he says, and the mention  of these two jogs his memory, “Have you seen what they were planning?”  he asks. I don’t know why, but Stephen’s got their newsletter on his desktop. It’s  titled “Resources for the Chemically Injured” and below it says “Proposal to  Build a Housing Community for People with MCS.”  I skim through it. Escalante House is a nonprofi t, non-religious organization with three guid- ing principles: conservation, creativity and compassion. . . . We are currently  negotiating with the State of Utah to locate MCS housing on 325 acres of land  owned by the State three miles south of Escalante, Utah . . . Garfi eld County  requires six acres for every home site. That means there could be up to 54  home sites on the proposed site. . . .  And so on: </page> <page sequence="60"> Ha r d  R o a d s     16 7 . . . camping area, low-income apartments . . . medical clinic . . . cafeteria, of- fi ces . . . small auditorium . . . natural food store . . . studios . . . workshops. “Well,” I say. Veater offers me a tour of the mill. In the middle of the fl oor stands  the sash gang saw, and it is one malefi c-looking piece of machinery. The  blades of the sash cycle faster than the eye can follow, ripping planks into  straight lines and sawdust to the accompaniment of a clamant nasal buzz and  a scrannel machine screech, and when I get closer, I hear a high-voltage hum  relayed from the Page power plant via Garkane Power and I feel the fl oor  boards vibrating as that bandog tugs on its mounts and tries to break free. Walking somebody from Friends of the Dixie in here would be like walking a  vegan into a slaughterhouse, I think.  The gang saw is in the middle of the operation. When the boles arrive  at the log yard, they’re sorted into classes according to type and quality and  bucked to a particular length. Then they’re debarked, loaded on a log deck  and drawn onto the carriage by an endless lumber chain at the sawyer’s com- mand. Wally leads me into the sawyer’s booth and closes the door, cutting off  the noise, and I am instantly at home. In fact, I want the sawyer’s job. He  sits, while everybody else in the mill stands, in a closet-sized space dark  as a video arcade, with a switch-studded joystick in each hand and pedals  beneath his feet, before a window, leaning over the headsaw and a panel lit  like a car dash, with gauges and meters and more switches and buttons, with  his attention focused on the log on the rolling carriage and the red laser  guide rippling over its raw, blonde surface. The guy running the show now  doesn’t even look up to see who we are, just tips and spins the joysticks as  fast as they’ll roll, but when Wally asks him to explain the process, there’s no  urgency in the sawyer’s reply. He could be talking to us over a cup of coffee  with his full attention on us, just as I was once able to chat with my friends  while my hands shoved and twisted and fl apped the controls of a video game,  trying to save my virtual life. Frames called “knees” press against the log, and attached grappling irons,  or “dogs,” snub it to the carriage. The computer scans the log with a red  laser beam and uses an algorithm to calculate the optimal cut and the saw- yer fi ne tunes the selection or overrides it based on grain and knots and the  general shape of the log and his experience and then aligns the carriage to  set up the cut, and then cables fed through idler pulleys to keep the motion  constant draw the carriage and the log, riding on wheels known as “trucks,”  through the band saw and back through it again on the return stroke, and  then the sawyer may set up another cut on the same face or release the dogs  </page> <page sequence="61"> 16 8     H i g hw ay  12 and manipulate the claws and bars of the set-works to gig the log for another  angle. A large ponderosa like the one loaded up now can be reduced to  workable cants in about a minute. This is the heart of the mill and it’s where  the operation bottlenecks, so the sawyer has to know his job. The curved outside slabs go to a horizontal resaw where another sawyer  salvages what he can from them, and the inside cants go to graders who  evaluate them for tightness, appearance, and defects such as burns, knots,  gentle “sweeps” in the grain or abrupt “crooks” and advance them to a trimmer who planes and edges them down to their fi nal dimensions and  then a sorter who sends them down a “sort chute” into one of twelve piles.  The thick center cant, meanwhile, arrives at the graders’ tables by way of  the gang saw. The scraps from all these processes are shipped to an outfi t in  Circleville, which tosses them into a tub grinder and makes pulp or mulch  or wood chips out of them.  We pay a visit to Veater’s workshop, where half-a dozen men are kept  constantly busy machine grinding the blades and working them by hand,  checking their hook and pitch, welding cracks and shaping them and swag- ing them in preparation for use. Each blade takes about one and a half  hours to grind and the blades run on the drum four hours at a time. When  properly maintained, an eight-hundred-dollar blade will last about nine  months. Long ago, lumber mills used to rely primarily on circular saws, but the  larger operations all use band saws now because they have a thinner kerf and  waste less product. The double-cut continuous saw blades, the ones Wally  works on, are thirty-two feet long and have a kerf of 150 thousandths of an  inch.  Wally points out the micro mill they’ve set up in the yard for processing  the smaller jobs they’re anticipating. Right now that mill, which is about the  size and shape of a ship container, is locked up, just as the thinning contracts  are locked up by environmental appeals. Then Veater turns me loose to  explore the yard on my own, and I wander past the kiln, where almost all  the lumber has to be dried these days to kill off the beetles, and the stacks  of fi nished lumber, past a John Deere 744E log loader parked on the side of  the lot, which looks like a regular front loader on steroids, with two giant,  worn teeth on its lower jaw.  From outside, from a short distance, the mill appears as big shacks and  utility sheds and pipes, vats, bins, hoppers, roller chains, cables, a few mas- sive Caterpillars and fl atbeds ready to roll with the fi nished product, and  piles of sawdust. Everywhere in the yard and for a radius of at least a mile  when the wind is blowing, you can smell sawdust. </page> <page sequence="62"> Ha r d  R o a d s     16 9 Steed’s brand is: Red Breaks My plans fall to pieces that fi rst night on Sheffi eld Road. I wanted to walk  down Phipps Wash, where Doctor Diehl almost died, and see the arch and  the natural bridge where it joins the Escalante River. Maybe I would even  hike up to Bowington Arch on the far side. I wanted to explore Harris Can- yon, where Charles Hall rerouted southbound pioneers a few years after  he helped put through the route to Hole-in-the-Rock, and there were a couple of sandslides I wanted to take a look at further down where his route intersected the Escalante River and there was a chimney somewhere off the  road I wanted to see, the only thing that remained of Sam Sheffi eld’s cabin,  but I don’t do or see any of these things, and I blame the rocks for that.  I’m part-way down the road, past the old corral, the stone beehives and  idol’s heads when the sun begins to set so I pull off to a white rock outcrop- ping, and the Heap crawls far enough down it for me to be hidden from the  road, down to the rim and a stack of rocks blocking the wind from an old  fi re pit. I park on the other side, perpendicular to the breeze, to form a wind  shadow and then gather up deadwood and start the fi re. And then I sit on  the edge, with the disjointed orange sunlight refracted into planes by con- trails ebbing into white pulses, and study the prairie known as Big Spencer  Flat that begins almost at my feet and the red billows and mesas out near  the Escalante River and the three spectral-blue peaks of the Henrys and the  black cap of Navajo Mountain and the rock wedges out at Red Breaks, and I  think, Those rocks at Red Breaks are what I’ve been looking for all along, I’ve got  to go there.  Next day I take a side trip in low four-wheel-drive off to the west on  a sand-trap road, to a sharp-tipped nameless red inselberg. It’s a “class 4”  climb to the top, according to Steve Allen (100), and I’ve got places to be, so  I only hike up a hundred feet or so, and I make notes on the slickrock, study  the seams that develop independent of the bedding planes and split it like  linear faults and the resulting “critical partings” delineating the dangerous  concavities where the Navajo Sandstone domes curve down into a vertical  plane and then jut back out into a nearly horizontal footslope, and other  thin fractures that funnel water to the brush that takes root in them to pry  them apart. Sheer, unsupported sandstone cliff faces could be fi ve thousand feet  high if they weren’t weakened by fractures (Terzaghi, 251-270), but all of  them are, to one degree or another. Cracks propagate linearly as “fracture </page> <page sequence="63"> 17 0     H i g hw ay  12 mirrors” from microscopic semi-circular fl aws or radiate out in successive  circular hackles. The fractures may initially be imparted by tectonic action;  valley fl oors with their overburden of rock removed tend to bulge upward.  They may also result from weaker, underlying shales giving way unevenly,  which tends to cause “rotational” block failures. In any case, weathering  loosens the calcite bonds in the slickrock along minute cracks, water pours  in and freezes and plant roots dig down and loosen things further. Domes  exfoliate rock in sheets and cliffs spall off blocks which tilt outward until  their centers of gravity cross the hinge at the base and they topple or rotate  loose. In some parts of the world, if the block is large enough, it may ride the  loose rock slope beneath it intact for up to seven miles (Watson, 522-548). Sandstone faces organize themselves into arched alcoves and blind win- dows because these are the most stable forms for supporting overhanging  loads. A single slab failure will initiate the process by redistributing stress  lines from the new keystone laterally onto the adjacent rock; the resulting  horizontal compression serves to hold that rock in place. Where thrust lines  pass through the stone, it’s kept wedged in place; otherwise when it loosens,  it’s free to fall. Straight sandstone walls form bays and amphitheaters through a similar  mechanism. Convex walls are simply more resistant to lateral stress than  straight escarpments. The “elephant skin,” or “hadrosaur skin,” as I call it, the polygonal  cracking, is a surface phenomenon; it extends only a foot or two into the  rock.  Around here, wind and sheetwash strip the rock away one grain at a time.  Hence, no talus fans at the bottom of the slopes. The road turns to washboard, then potholes, and then it’s just two tracks  in sand. I have to spin the tires to get through and I brake hard enough to  almost get the Heap sideways just before the sand transitions to rock be- cause the wonderful frictional gradient between rubber and slickrock will  sometimes snap a spinning axle like a pencil.  The last part of the road is a sandstone shelf. I walk in a wide circle to  make sure the road doesn’t pick up again anywhere and then I pour some  peanuts into my pocket and fi ll the water bottle and walk into the slickrock  anomy near Red Breaks with no plan in mind but exploring. Right off, before I’ve reached the breaks, I fi nd iron bands in the sand- stone with concretions birthing from them like sterile rock eggs: double  concretions and UFO saucers, shapeless blobs, bifurcated brains and yo-yos  and sombreros. Soon after, I come to ziggurat buttes with cross-bedding like  </page> <page sequence="64"> Ha r d  R o a d s     171 Hackles in sandstone near half-dome rope coils and past them the white rock fades out and leaves the red sand- stone that gives the breaks its name. I fi nd a survey marker pounded into  stone in 1937; it says “Fine for removal $250.” I climb into the breaks, cross by a cairn, though there’s no trail here I  know of and certainly none I could follow, climb around the side on a nar- row bench and out to a successive weirdness of massive, dune-bedded white  domes, the faces of which are landscapes in and of themselves, and I climb  one of these domes to its brown caprock, a fl at of manzanita, thistle and  juniper with another, smaller bench on top of it, which I also climb. Coming  over the edge, the wind almost pushes me off but I lean into it and, squint- ing, I can see the whole length of Fifty Mile Mountain, the Henry Moun- tains, Navajo Mountain, breaks in the wall to the east where I can see the  red Circle Cliffs, another far-off Navajo dome which is actually a half-dome,  a white, ice-cream scoop dome, maybe a fossil meander from the ancient Escalante, now thrust into the sky, and up north there’s the infi nite black  edge of the Aquarius Plateau. Not a straight line in sight, not the domes or the streams or the junipers  or even the undersides of the cumulus clouds above the Aquarius, which are  curved to its surface, not the sky nor time nor the rock which erodes into  bows, only the lines in my journal, which I can’t follow because even when I  sit, the wind blows me sideways. </page> <page sequence="65"> 17 2     H i g hw ay  12 It’s taken me most of the day to get here. I walk down from that wind- blasted peak to fi nd another way back but I come to an amphitheater with  smooth concave walls and I can’t help rolling a few circular stones off the  top. The results are spectacular; when I toss the rocks down spinning, they  pick up speed and shoot out the bottom, maybe two hundred feet below, like  lethal projectiles, skimming over the fl oor at a hundred miles-plus per hour,  skipping off obstacles like trees and boulders and launching through the void  for two heartbeats while they pick up more speed, until these indurated cap- rocks detonate like fi reworks against a cliff-line at the far edge of the fl at.  This phenomenon requires scientifi c study, so in the time I should be  fi nding my way down, I’m tossing different-sized rocks off the rim. My  eventual goal is to get the rocks through gaps in the cliff at the far corner of  the stone plain below me, into the narrows beyond it, sort-of like knocking a  pinball past bumpers at the machine’s upper end. I have to strain my back to  get a few specimens moving and the larger ones tend to disintegrate as they  go and they come out of the slalom like shotgun blasts with a few fragments  headed in the right direction but with so much kinetic energy sapped by  breaking free and getting up to speed that none of them makes it to the edge.  Rocks the size and shape of a discus hold their integrity well, but I have to go  further and further out from the edge to fi nd them and fi nally I worry more  about their fl atness than how circular they are, which turns out to be a wise  move because they shape themselves as they tumble. Near the cliff line they  hum like a tire spun off a semi-tractor trailer. Round stones also perform  well, which surprises me because they’re too solid to be chipped away into a  more perfectly circular shape. I catch myself grimacing as I watch these bullets ricochet and go airborne  for a hundred feet and splatter into red sprays at the end of the course. I also experiment with different launching points. At one location—the  black hole, I call it—rocks stop dead against some hidden obstacle at the base  of the wall, which might be sand because a soft thump is often the last noise  I hear from them. Another spot imparts a super-high velocity but there’s no  break in the cliff in that direction and no ramps beforehand to help stones  clear it. An hour in and I fi nd the sweet spot that puts the rock in a terminal,  high-speed, high-jumping trajectory for the gaps. A disc fi nally shatters off a  boulder near the end of the course and a few fragments spin past the crags,  over a sand trap and into the abyss. A few minutes later I get a hand-sized  rock to do the same thing without losing more than a few pebbles off its  mass. The experiment is a success, and with the sun half sunk through Fifty  Mile Mountain, it’s time to get back to the Heap. In the morning, I drive Sheffi eld Road to where it quits at a drill pipe.  Again I walk out in a circle from the deadend to see if there’s a connecting </page> <page sequence="66"> Ha r d  R o a d s     17 3 road, onto yellow-banded slickrock and into blanket sand where I do fi nd  deer tracks but not much else. By midmorning I’m on my way back to High- way 12, listening to AC/DC’s “Back in Black,” which is inappropriate music  for this environment and makes me drive too fast. I take another side road  and it leads me to another abandoned pipe. Hendrix sings about a room  full of mirrors and Robert Plant says “It’s been a long time,” and then, as I  turn onto the highway, headed for Escalante, where the dam will surely fail  when the heavy rains fi nally come, I feel the heartbeats of titans that walked  the earth before the gods in my sternum, and the harmonica wails from all  corners of the sky and I feel the levee about to break. Half-Dome A few days ago, a woman froze to death not far west of here, up on the Kai- parowits Plateau, on Death Ridge, and here I am sweating in a T-shirt as I  drive down Harris Wash. My plan is to drive the length of the wash, cross the Escalante and drive  up Silver Falls Creek to Moody Canyon Road. I know there’s no way that’s  going to happen because part of the route is in the Glen Canyon Recreation  Area and it’s fenced off, and the locals tell me the old road is washed out, but  that’s the plan. And it quickly goes awry. The road to the trailhead at Harris Wash con- tinues on the other side—though none of my guidebooks show it and it’s  not on the 1:100,000 scale USGS maps either. It is in the Utah Wilderness  Coalition’s compendium of potential wilderness areas, Wilderness at the Edge,  oddly enough, and looks like it was penciled in.  It’s a good road so I decide to follow it rather than drive down the wash. It  skirts a low cliff line and swings up towards Red Breaks and detours around  an arroyo that’s eaten its banks back twenty feet—the original road now goes  off the edge of the wash—and I have to throw the Heap in low four-wheel- drive and plow through a few sand dunes that have drifted over the route to  get to the plain south of a giant white slug of Navajo Sandstone. It takes me  a minute to realize where I’m at; the base of the half-dome peak I’d seen in  the distance the day before. Now the day is completely shot. I have to climb to that half-dome, that  abandoned meander in the sky, if that’s what it really is. I park the Heap,  take off across the plain, zigzag up the face, past white arabesques in red  rock and pizza-crust rock and swirling incoherences which are the shape of  the wind and red stone oozing up from pores and dozens of potholes which  are hidden until I’m almost on top of them, sunk like shafts fi fteen feet or  more into the sandstone, at the bottom of which I half expect to fi nd some  explorer’s bones.  </page> <page sequence="67"> 174     H i g hw ay  12 What looked like a solid outcropping of Navajo Sandstone is actually in- cised by three valleys—one, visible from the road, draining south from a mouth  halfway up the side, the two fl anking it draining north. Near the top, on the  west side, I fi nd a sill, a critical parting far above the piedmont, and follow it  around to the head of the fi rst valley which has a broad mouth and joins with  the third valley further downstream, but upstream quickly thins into a V and  then a tight narrows, the fl oor of which is over a hundred feet below me and  hidden from view by the curve of the wall. There’s a thin lintel of red sand- stone, a future arch, above the slot, which becomes just a fi ssure as it curves up  to the head. Nearby, there’s a four foot tall spire, an altar to this temple. How can we blame those who would worship nature in an environment  such as this? The temples are ready-made in this country and Mormon  churches pale in comparison. The only question I have as I stand near the  altar is which deity does this temple honor? I get the feeling that it’s the  spirit of running water, in whatever name it goes by, that is invoked here,  specifi cally the streams that can develop such temples over millions of years  from mere cracks in the sandstone. I climb up a redrock chute and cross the red beam, the caprock of sand- stone so friable I can crumble fragments of it in my hands, and follow the  sinuous ridge that joins all three valleys, to the top of the south-facing draw,  which is broader than the fi rst but ends in another sheer wall and I keep  hiking out to another red altar, ten feet tall, to the abandoned meander wall  that faces me, or rather faces the sky behind me. There’s a line of square  openings high up in that edifi ce, like pueblo windows, and its base is a shaly  purple rock in which, with binoculars, I discern a tiny doorway, or perhaps  just two fallen slabs that give that appearance.  Below me is a hidden, sublime sand valley fl at formed from walls turned  down in ideal geometric curves. There’s rabbitbrush, manzanita and Rus- sian olive growing in the sand and the cracks, and some grass and juni- per and pinyon, and there’s a water pocket in a shaded alcove. Perhaps a  Fremont Indian grew crops here eight hundred years ago and climbed to  this altar each day to pray to the god that made that meander and that  then scoured and disintegrated the rock plain around it until it became the  channel of the river of wind that pours through these last peaks. If I were  a Fremont Indian, I would certainly try to make a go of it here, damming  that alcove with a low masonry wall and constructing catchwaters in the  valley to feed my fi elds, and I would build a small pueblo or cliff-dwelling  at some defensible point and put a granary beneath the meander, symbol  of my god, and make offerings to it at the altar, and when the rains came, I  would dance in the liquid veils which must pour in from every nick on the  rim of this small kingdom.  </page> <page sequence="68"> Ha r d  R o a d s     17 5 I feel compelled to tip my cap at the altar, a sign not of humility, I hope,  but of recognition and respect for the entity or the deity or force that resides  behind the ancient face, the immortal spirit whose true name has not been  spoken by the wind since it built up this dune. And having paid my respects,  I now feel safe to approach. I walk up some amoeboid red steps of sandstone  on the thin ridge and slide along a thin kerf to the head of the third wash,  and around it and across the steep slope on the far side, hugging the wall and  testing the rock face because if I slip I will accelerate down the steepening  convex face and into the canyon, with my head bouncing off the narrowing  walls far below until my body becomes jammed between them like a cork  driven into a bottle. A thirteen-foot drop from a shearing weathering rind is the last obstacle  to the fl at stone pediment beneath the wall. Inching down it I realize again  that this is precisely the sort of thing I promised my wife I wouldn’t do. But  the crescent plain is worth the effort and danger. The two slabs beneath  the wall were put there intentionally, chinked in place with mud probably a  thousand years ago. I check the interior for corn cobs and search the area but  fi nd no artifacts save for a cairn, four black slab rocks piled three feet high. I  also fi nd bizarre geofact concretions: a hinged fl ange, a column with layered  cross-sections like tree rings, a bottle with a curved neck, a jar, a hollow tube,  a mandrake root. Up on the wall I fi nd natural, faint, wavy ghost etchings,  one with its arms raised up in supplication or warning, one leaning into shock  waves. Where the patinad  rock has crumbled the stone  beneath is pink like new skin. Hiking back down the  checkerboard slope, I come  across potholes that bear an  uncanny resemblance to the  two dimensional illustrations  of gravity wells or black holes  you might fi nd in a physics  textbook, and I wonder when  I will fi nd one that’s a portal,  that goes right through the  rock to the next world. Next day I follow the road  out to its end, a drill pipe  Edge of the Escalante River Gorge </page> <page sequence="69"> 176     H i g hw ay  12 with some English and some Greek words torched into it: 660 FSL 1980  FWL, 11-4-71, Amoco Prod. Co. U.S.A. Amoco “G” #1. After an exten- sive survey, I determine that the trail does not continue from the pipe in  any direction, which is disappointing because a few miles back, where the  road came down through a stone draw, I found wagon ruts. In fact, I’d been  expecting to fi nd those ruts the whole trip because the low rock shelves  abutting the road had been picked back from it, which wouldn’t have helped  drillers at all, but would have saved the pioneers a lot of effort. I’m supposed to be searching out old pioneer roads and I’m not; instead  I’m stumbling on them. But I don’t know where the original pioneer road  runs, where it turns off, how it reaches the river gorge, where the connecting  road is, and after a few hours of searching, I’m no closer to fi nding out. On the assumption that the old road here connects to the sandslides the  pioneers used to access the Escalante River, I park the Heap again and hike  due east, making for the gorge, which turns out to be about three times  further away than it appeared, and then I hike the rim northward, which  turns out to be the wrong direction. But a strange thing happens. I head  side canyons and hike up to shale shelves and old banks covered by water- polished stones now six hundred feet above the river, down to draws fi lled  with volcanic boulders from the Aquarius Plateau, out to the edge of the  gorge, which I follow for miles, but the sun remains motionless, and so do  my watch’s hands. Time stays still while I struggle upstream. I come to a spot where the river meanders right up against an overhang- ing wall fi ve hundred feet high and, further on, an overlook of an abandoned  meander, a billion-ton boulder in the middle of the stream. Three ducks  swoop and dive up the gorge, and one breaks off as if on a dare, rockets  through the old channel jigging like a jet fi ghter, rejoins the other two and  they skim the walls until they’re out of sight. Further on, a side canyon’s  walls spiral out from the Escalante gorge like a snail shell on its side. The  canyon’s mouth is ten feet wide; you could hold off an army here, and there  are a few overhangs under which to build a shelter, but I see no signs of Fre- mont habitation from the rim, only footprints. Walking back across the prairie to the Heap takes twice as long as walking  out. Mostly I’m crossing low dunes and sand sheets held in place by sage- brush and some ring grass and Mormon tea. Sometimes the sand has been  striped away by the wind and I will walk over the bare top of a delitescent  dome which will rise someday as half-dome has risen. I fi nd my own foot- prints once in a while but I lose them when I cut across my own meanders  and I fi nd coyote prints on a dune face that have been so elongated that I  initially mistake them for human tracks. </page> <page sequence="70"> Ha r d  R o a d s     17 7 Axle used as a fence anchor in Harris Wash Mare’s tails drift over the still sun. A private plane, maybe a Cessna, drones  by just above the sandstone peaks. I get back to the Heap and record how  time has alternately sped up and slowed down the last few days, how each  strata of rock carries its own temporal properties, how landmarks move, how  the quickest route is never a straight line, how there are no straight lines,  how you’ll never fi nd something when you’re looking for it here.  When I start the Heap up and begin the journey back, the sun resumes  its western drift. It’s time now to explore Harris Wash as far as I can drive it,  and I ride up the stream as it cuts deep into the sandstone. Sting is singing “Demolition Man” but soon I can barely hear it above the engine roar re- verberating off the bluffs.  I like the Heap loud, by the way. I like a throaty snarl from the exhaust.  I clamped a cherry bomb to the end of the pipe because I like to set off car  alarms in parking garages. But after a half-hour of this, I get annoyed my- self. I shut the Heap off and an overpressure of silence rushes in to fi ll the  vacuum. The stream burbles just loud enough to cover the tinnitis in my left  ear and the cottonwoods creak and sift the light breeze.  The sun is in the  </page> <page sequence="71"> 17 8     H i g hw ay  12 trees but I still have a little time and I get out of the Heap and walk upstream  a half-mile or so, take some photographs of the cottonwoods against the red  rock, and stop in midstream and listen for a while. As I head for Hole-in-the-Rock Road, Sting sings “One world is enough  for all of us.”  “Oh shut up,” I tell him. Fence Canyon When I came through Escalante a couple days earlier, I forgot to fi ll the six- gallon water can and that’s normally not a problem but I’ve been making a  lot of coffee lately and now, in the parking area above Fence Canyon, I only  have a few drops left. Going back is out of the question: I’d waste half a day. “Diffi culty: Strenuous,” says Rudi Lambrechtse of the hike I’m about to  embark on in his guidebook on the Escalante region. “Length (one way): 3.5  miles” (131). Three-point-fi ve steep miles, with no water. I pack the stove and the mess  kit and walk down the steepest grade, feeling nauseous already because I  didn’t drink much the night before. The faster I get down, the sooner I drink, I think, and I hurry and get lost,  take the wrong branch of the canyon and end up following a wash through  a slickrock tunnel, down into dry, wave-bedded slickrock chambers to a  three-hundred foot drop-off. There’s some murky water in nearby potholes  and the thirst receptors in the back of my throat are beginning to register  strongly but I backtrack instead, past a block of sandstone that’s pulled back  from the wall just enough to form a narrow arch, back to the ridgeline,  which I follow down until I fi nd the usual signs that cows once grazed here,  which is reassuring because cows don’t do much climbing. Across the canyon from me, huge honeycomb grottos have been weath- ered into the wall, some of them connected to each other by tunnels further  back in the rock. I scan these with my binoculars but see no cliff dwellings,  no granaries, nothing, and these hollows look like they are highly defen- sible.   Were the Fremont insane? I wonder. Soon I can see the trail I should have been on all along below me and I  fi nd a debris train I can slide down and footprints at the base, so I know I’m  not alone in descending the wrong canyon. At the bottom, I have to thrash  through a thick tamarisk grove to get to the trail, but the rest is compara- tively easy.  Lambrechtse’s book has a picturesque line camp on the bench near the  end of the side canyon, with some antlers tacked to the front and what ap- pears to be a ladder on the cliff face next to it, but the line-camp was torched  </page> <page sequence="72"> Ha r d  R o a d s     17 9 by arsonists back in April of 1990 according to writer Steve Allen. Now  there’s just some charcoal on a concrete foundation and a small corral, some  petroglyphs of rectangular-bodied antelope or bighorn sheep, some Moqui  steps and a few cowboy names: Perry Liston, A. Crespin, and what I believe  is Dell LeFevre’s brand:    And there are a few others: I hear hikers coming up the trail and crossing the Escalante. I introduce  myself to them: three men, a couple of women and a dog, “Chester,” who  actually trotted up and inspected me before the others got there to make  sure I was all right. They all camped on the banks of the river last night. One  of the young women points to the clear stream from Fence Canyon mixing  into the Escalante’s vomitous pea-green water. “That’s the last place you’re going to fi nd fresh water,” she says. I ask them if they saw the other petroglyph panel nearby and they all give  me blank looks, and then they look skeptical. I tell them it should have been  hard to miss, but apparently they walked right by it.  “Was it in any of the guidebooks?” one of them asks. “No,” I say, “Reece Stein told me about it. You know, the newscaster on  Channel 2.” Now they look very skeptical, and I’m wondering if I’ll have to do some  serious searching to fi nd it. I tell them about the petroglyphs up on the  bench and they show me the best place to cross the river. Crossing the river wasn’t on the itinerary, but it’s a hot day and I’m up for  it. The Escalante is waist high and fast fl owing, so I have to face into it, and  it’s still ice cold, so my feet go numb before I’m halfway across. On the other  side I scoop some water up and put it on the stove and explore out to each  edge of the sandbar. It would be handy if I could fi nd a route up to the top  of the bench but I can’t, and the river winds back against the cliff, in several  places it looks like, which means several crossings where I don’t know how  deep the river is going to be. The water takes ten minutes to boil and I keep it going for another ten  minutes to be safe and then I boil another pot. All in all, by the time I’ve  boiled half a liter and let the river cool it, I’ve wasted a full hour, but when  the water hits my throat it seems worth it. I trudge down the trail, cross the river four times and I’m at the panel  of wavy lines and block-bodied anthropomorphs, bear tracks walking up  the cliff, herds of antelope and bighorn, hunters and aliens, caped fi gures,  </page> <page sequence="73"> 18 0     H i g hw ay  12 Anthropomorph petroglyphs near Fence Canyon and a baby held by its hair, a waving eyeball, a couple of fi ghting Irishmen  probably etched by pioneers or bored cowboys, a sun and a shooting star, a  trapezoid Fremont with a feathered headdress in his regalia of necklaces and  epaulets, a two-headed sheep, a coyote, a stippled fi gure and newer etchings:  Hall, March 21, 1881; William Osborn, 1894; Roe and Ray Barney, 1946; E.

Why do graffi ti artists keep tagging my  mother’s garage in Salt Lake City? I walk upstream and spot more old glyphs, look for artifacts and fi nd a  stairway carved into the side of the wall leading up one story to a bench and  a sloping pasture. It would satisfy me to walk out to the house-sized head- stones at the east end of the prairie to see if there are any more petroglyphs  at their bases but the sun is almost behind the cliffs and I’ve got a pint of  water left.

This time I follow the trail  up the switchbacks to the  bench, to the rock face. I can  see the cairns even in dark- ness. The last steep grade is  murderous, seems to go on  for hours, makes me light- headed. I take a step and rest  and step and rest until the  stars come out, and I raise  my bottle now and again  and a couple drops fall to my  tongue.  Later that night I’m speed- ing toward Escalante, cough- ing, laughing. I’m almost sick  enough to pull over some- times but I don’t because  there’s water ahead. “Good old Heap,” I say,  “parts fall off it but it keeps going.” Ghost Rock Chimney Rock is a monolith out on a plain east of Hole-in-the-Rock Road,  another monument to an ancient white rock wilderness that was spirited away  by rain splash and sheet wash a million or so years ago. What protected it while  the rest of the mesa was washed out, nobody seems to know, but it’s visible for  miles as a sort of beacon for travelers in this remote wasteplain and every pio- neer and tourist and every cowpoke who came this way left his name on it.  This morning, I’m reading the inscriptions on the base of Chimney Rock.

Edward Abbey, writing about the proposed road in Slickrock, said “The  conservationists and wilderness advocates contend that funds for economic  development in southeast Utah should be spent on the improvement of al- ready-existing roads in the area, many of which are yet unpaved” (55). When  the proposed road through here was abandoned, however, and Garfi eld  County followed the advice of those “conservationist and wilderness advo- cates” and tried to pave the Burr Trail further north, environmentalists sued  the Department of the Interior and the county and everybody else involved  in the paving to bring it to a halt, and they are still suing today. I’ve been down that ghost highway. The night before last I studied maps  of it by moonlight while I laid in my sleeping bag and the next morning I  walked down to a slickrock plain and over to Crack-in-the-Wall, which is  just what the name implies; a crescent of rock separated from the sandstone  rim of Coyote Gulch, about a foot and a half wide. It leads to a sand hill  above an abandoned meander with a massive red fi n in the middle of it lean- ing over the trail, with Stevens Arch immediately visible to the east, a wall  with a great hole punched through it by an angry old god. I followed the ghost highway down the sand slope to the stream at the  bottom of Coyote Gulch and walked upstream a few miles to Cliff Arch,  which looks like an elephant skull and trunk.  Beneath the high Wingate  cliffs, the sand and talus angle down to a bench above the river, which is  immediately cut back so the water washes over the rims of stone and maid- enhair in freestanding waterfalls. It was cool down there and there were  muddy grottos and deep pockets of rock fi lled with reeds bent downstream  and cold emerald plunge pools. I found scattered bits of old charcoal and  pottery shards.  That ghost road would have been a wonder of the world, but Coyote  Gulch is already a quiet wonder and would have been diminished by it.  Nobody talks about the highway now, and so it has joined a sort of  imaginary topography. There are phantom national monuments here and </page> <page sequence="76"> Ha r d  R o a d s     18 3 Coyote Gulch Wall phantom wilderness areas and a phantom green river and a spectral canyon  beneath Lake Powell.

Potholes The landscape around Bellemont, Arizona, where I once lived, is covered  with dead cinder cones and I’ve always wanted to spend a night in one of  them, ensconced in a closed world, a womb, only the earth and the heavens  and me. This fall morning I wake up in a pothole. It’s not a large one; it’s roughly  eight feet long, maybe three and a half feet deep, but it blocks out the whole  world except for the sky. I studied the stars last night through binoculars and  followed the lights of jets, listening for the growl that came down when they  were two-thirds of the way across my fi eld of vision. Yesterday I explored Dance Hall Rock where the pioneers of the San Juan  Mission, with their wagons circled at Forty Mile Camp, spent their evenings  </page> <page sequence="77"> 18 4     H i g hw ay  12 Rockscape behind Dance Hall Rock while scouts tried to fi nd a way to the river. The sign at the head of the road  read “Spirits were high before news of what lies ahead arrived,” and I won- dered why. They could have seen the slickrock confusion they were fated for  from where I was standing. I watched for cowboyglyphs and local names again on Dance Hall Rock  and I found them: Heaps, Woolsey, Jepson, Alvey, and these: Somebody has inscribed “Jesus is God” on the fl oor.  My guidebook said it was worth exploring behind the Hall, so I walked  around it and then I walked off this world, into one of Edward Abbey’s “science-fi ction” landscapes of lumps, bumps, billows, banded rock at odds  with itself, fossil seifs, disharmonic folds, red mound monsters and narrows  and potholes. Potholes most of all—a garden of wallows, bowls, pits and ba- sins of any size and any shape imaginable or not. The fi rst one I came to had  scooped out the side of a parabolic rock dune so its edge became a rounded  enclosing wall and inside there was an apostrophe-shaped courtyard, a small  lake, a cottonwood tree on the bank, a sward of grass never touched by cows.  Nearby there was a thirty-foot-wide wormhole augured straight down about  twenty feet with a grass glen at the bottom and cottonwoods just cresting  the rim. Further on there was a hole overhung by its walls, maybe forty-fi ve  feet long and fi fteen feet deep and no way to climb out and only some rab- </page> <page sequence="78"> Ha r d  R o a d s     18 5 bitbrush on a pile of sand at one end for a trapped man or animal to subsist  on. Some potholes had their own ecosystems: grasslands and cottonwood  groves, and some contained lakes and island oases. Some were Z-shaped,  some round, some bunched so thick they were blending into each other, and  there were a few massive ovoid amphitheaters with groves or passageways at  one end where the water fi nally broke through.  I found a Zen garden, a rock fl at where cobblestones in pockets had been  arranged just so by water evaporating between the low dunes, the sand and  rock proportioned by some cosmic constant, and came to a cross-hatched  yellow and white cone at the garden’s far end and I sat there and contemplat- ed it, and I contemplated that place, the schizophrenic slickrock molded into  shapes beyond the normal vocabulary of landscapes, and I decided that since  the water pools and digs down and evaporates, since it doesn’t fl ow any- where except into holes, the pothole garden is morphological kin to plains  gouged out by glaciers, because neither of them have the coherent drainage  patterns we generally rely on for classifi cation. As for the formation itself, what do you call a massive mound of solid  serpiginous rock risen out of some basal mental recess? You could call it a  bornhardt or inselberg, but these don’t communicate the deep emotional  resonance of such places, or the logic bent ninety degrees, or the rock octo- pus tentacles I witnessed at its edges, slinking back into the sagebrush plain.  Where are the names for such things? In the evening, I drove further down the road and climbed Sooner Rocks,  another pothole garden, but with the crucial difference that where the pied- mont of the rocks behind the Hall sloped gently into the ground, here the  transition was a two-hundred foot cliff-line. Narrows simply drop into oblivi- on and if you slipped from the top of a dome, you’d have the ride of your life.  The deeper potholes usually contained water but very little vegetation.  They were shafts, wells, human traps. One was thirty feet deep and only a  third as wide.  I stayed in the Sooner Rocks’ interior for the most part. I climbed down  to the nexus of three great sandstone bubbles, with a stagnant pool in it and  some thistle nearby and a passageway leading out to the edge, and I climbed  a ledge to where it ended just close enough to a steep rock face for me to  reach out and pull myself across the drop-off with my fi ngers.  That’s the way Sooner Rocks are: just a bit larger than the human scale,  hence just a bit dangerous. From the top, in twilight, I spotted a bleb of rock towards the road shaped  like a walrus nose and I saw a giant doughnut-shaped, Mars-red sandstone  </page> <page sequence="79"> 18 6     H i g hw ay  12 lobe north of me, eaten away from the inside. I climbed down to the base  and hiked up a short rock wash; two planes of sandstone meeting at a V so  tight it pinched my feet and I had to stem through. Then I looked around for a pothole and found this one. I was actually  looking for something deeper and wider but the darkness forced the deci- sion. I threw my fl ashlight in fi rst to see how a lit pothole would appear from  a distance, and it looked like you would expect, like a subterranean dweller  had turned on a night light. Then I threw in a couple books, unrolled my  sleeping bag and read for a while as cutworms tried to escape up the side,  and then I turned off the light and all meaning was reduced to what I could  see from the narrow horizons of my cocoon; stars and nebulae, the Milky  Way, the clouds, a crescent moon, an occasional airplane.  I can recommend sleeping in a pothole to anyone, unless it’s raining, but  even then a tarp over the opening would make a good shelter. You get out  of the wind. Your personal effects don’t roll away from you. The cutworms  will keep you company. The End Soda Gulch, “the Sodie” as some locals call it, is just down the road from  Sooner Rocks. There’s not much to see on the west side, just an echo cham- ber rock corral, the foundation of the Griffi ns’ burnt line camp and an old  trailer that’s replaced it. But the Sodie was the last recorded place Everett  Ruess was seen. Ruess met two sheepherders here, Clayton Porter and Addlin Lay, on  November 9, 1934, and spent a couple days grilling them about the sur- rounding country, what was worth seeing and how to get there. The infor- mation came in handy for him, got him into Davis Canyon, though he told  the sheepherders he was headed for Hole-in-the-Rock.  Three months after he left Escalante, Everett’s parents received his  uncollected mail from Marble Canyon, Arizona, near present-day Page,  Ruess’s supposed next destination. In early March, a search party found his  two burros alive, though there’s some controversy about their condition,  in a brush corral in Davis Canyon, near the only point where it’s possible  to trail animals down there. His footprints were all over the canyon—he’d  obviously done a great deal of exploring—and there was garbage scattered  about where he’d camped and the searchers found “NEMO 1934” inscribed  in some ruins near the arch local cowboys called the Moqui Window, but  that’s about all they found of Everett. His “outfi t”—his bedroll and painting  kit, camera, food, journal, and cooking pans—was also missing. Further searches turned up more size-nine footprints leading to the base  of Fifty Mile Mountain, which the party also thoroughly explored, and </page> <page sequence="80"> Ha r d  R o a d s     18 7 another “NEMO 1934” inscription beneath a pictograph panel in Davis  Gulch, and that, by most accounts, was the end of the trail. The mystery of Ruess’s disappearance has kept a number of amateur  sleuths up at night and there are an equal number of implausible theories  out there, among them that Everett abandoned his burros and crossed the  Colorado River and washed clean his ties to his family and civilization at  large in the process and took a wife on the Navajo Reservation, where he  lived the rest of his days, and also that instead he kept walking and ended  up in Mexico, and also that Emery Kolb, famed explorer of the Grand Can- yon, might have killed him when Everett refused his sexual advances (one of  Mark A. Taylor’s hypotheses—though there’s good evidence both men liked  women). Baring the above, we’re left with three possibilities: that he died in a natu- ral accident, that he was murdered, or that he killed himself. The last one  seems far-fetched to me but Gary James Bergera tries to make a case for it  in his article, “The Murderous Pain of Living,” with quotes from Everett’s  letters, journals and unpublished short stories. Bergera makes Ruess out to  be a manic depressive, and he makes the usual connection between “Nemo,”  Latin for “no one,” as per the inscriptions in Davis Gulch, and Everett’s last  letter, where he referred to the wilderness around the Colorado River as a  place where “no one lives.” The theory sounds plausible if you start from the  premise that “a terrible melancholy permeates almost every line” of Ruess’s  writing (49), but I believe most readers see a guileless, angry young man, an  earnest youth who’s maybe read too many books. What’s more, Everett wrote prolifi cally through the last four years of  his short life, 175,000 words according to Bergera (50), so there’s plenty of  material that could be lifted out of context to make him look melancholy or  exuberant or cruel, loving, hateful, sensitive, insensitive, brash, shy, pretty  much whatever the researcher chooses. One aspect of Ruess’s personality nobody argues about is his reckless- ness. Ruess liked taking chances, traveling alone, living on nothing and not  knowing where his next meal was coming from, riding the rails, hitchhiking,  climbing cliffs to Indian ruins. There’s a strong possibility he got in over his  head on some adventure. Everett could have fallen to his death somewhere  outside the gulch, or he might have drowned in the Colorado River, as his  parents once believed. As Taylor himself suggests, maybe he made the same  mistake Abbey and Taylor did, jumping down into a hanging canyon from  which there was no escape.   So why would his outfi t be missing? Possibly someone absconded with it  after Ruess died, but A Vagabond for Beauty author W. L. Rusho discounts  this theory on the testimony of McKay Bailey’s father, Gail, a member of the  </page> <page sequence="81"> 18 8     H i g hw ay  12 initial search party, who “denied that he or anyone else could have removed  the outfi t before the main group of searchers found the camp site” (204).  Bergera has Ruess transporting his outfi t by burro to a remote locale and  hiding it, returning the burro(s) to the corral, returning again to his outfi t  or fi nding a “wild, lonely spot” (67), some place nobody would ever think to  look, and killing himself. If he’d moved the outfi t and brought the burro(s)  back in preparation for an extended sojourn into some rocky corner of the  Escalante country that didn’t have any feed for his animals and then died by  accident, however, his body and equipment might have been easier to fi nd,  but otherwise the results would have been nearly the same as if he’d delib- erately killed himself.  The most popular theory is that somebody murdered Everett and took  his outfi t. It might have been the cattle rustlers who were known to operate  at the remote borders of the Escalante drainage, or maybe it was a Navajo  outlaw named Jack Crank. Crank was rumored to have killed a white man  in the vicinity where Ruess vanished and he was rumored to have confessed  to the crime, but no formal charges were ever brought against him, and his  alleged confession puts him in the same league as one of the rustlers who  also supposedly claimed to have killed Everett. Rusho notes, “Against this  theory is the fact that no searcher reported seeing any footprints other than  Everett’s in Davis Gulch” (222). But what if the rustlers or Crank had come  across Ruess outside the gulch? What if he’d moved his outfi t nearer Hole- in-the-Rock Road and led his burro(s) back to the brush corral and met his  murderer(s) when he came back? Rusho further notes, “In the summer of 1957, an archaeologist working  on the Glen Canyon Archaeological Survey (prior to the fi lling of Lake Pow- ell) came across the remains of camping equipment—possibly Everett’s—in  a canyon tributary (Refl ection Canyon) of the Colorado River southwest  of Hole-in-the-Rock” (210). These consisted of a “rusty cup, spoon, fork,  kettles and pans, and a large canteen” and a box of razors manufactured in  Los Angeles. Ruess’s mother “could not be sure, but she doubted that they  belonged to Everett” (211), leaving the possibility that they did belong to  him, leaving the most remote possibility that he died after marveling over  the faith and willpower of the people who’d built that notch-in-the-cliff  road he must have traveled down to the river. Hole-in-the-Rock Road has been rough since I passed into Kane County  but past the Sodie it gets worse. The bedrock is exposed and I’m riding over  wagon ruts in sandstone. Ahead of me, the stippling of Navajo Mountain’s  blue slopes is beginning to resolve into trees and brush and I’m stunned by  </page> <page sequence="82"> Ha r d  R o a d s     18 9 the scale of it up close; it’s as if a huge blue and white aerolite had half-buried  itself into the plateau. There’s a turnoff about fi ve miles before Hole-in-the-Rock where you  can park your street car and hike/mountain bike in. A twenty-something  couple, Julie Woodke and Scott McKim, as I will come to fi nd out, park  their red economy car and unload their bikes as the Heap lurches fearlessly  up and over the sandstone waves and domes in four-wheel drive. It gets me  to Hole-in-the-Rock about fi ve minutes before them and I occupy my time  reading my guidebooks and the trail register. “Saw space ships,” reads one entry. “So did we!” reads another. “Toto,”  says a third, “we are not in Kansas anymore!”  Hole-in-the-Rock was just a slot down to the river when the pioneers  discovered it, and it’s still a slot, though it leads to Lake Powell now. The  grade was forty-fi ve degrees in places back then and it’s worse now because  the agger the Mormons used to fi ll in the drop-offs is washed out. A modern,  fuel-injected Jeep might have been able to make it down the original incline  but an older Jeep like mine would probably have conked out in a few places  where the carburetor was tilted too far from level to feed gas to the intake.  Then again, the engine’s primary function going down the road would have  been compressional braking, something the pioneers weren’t familiar with.  They accomplished the same results by chaining the wagon’s back wheels to  the box and having a team of men hold it back with ropes or by tying trees to  the ropes. “On occasion,” says David E. Miller, “a horse or mule was hitched  behind to pull back, but this proved to be rather rough treatment for the  animal as he was usually thrown to the ground and dragged down the steep  bumpy grade” (111). Scott and Julie arrive and we introduce ourselves and decide to go down to  the lake together. However, they quickly get ahead of me because I’m too busy  reading the walls, which are like half-mile long message boards. The normal  local names are present: Alvey, Steed, Wooley, Schow, Wilson, Moore, Jep- son, Hall. Gene Griffi n seems to have recorded his every visit to Hole-in-the- Rock. Fayette Alvey wrote “The fi rst car to the Hole” on May 23, 1941. I fi nd the following cowboyglyphs. A trading post operated briefl y at the base of Hole-in-the-Rock twenty  years after its construction and the steps we come across halfway down were  built by the operators. A great deal of rock has collapsed into the slot and at  </page> <page sequence="83"> 19 0     H i g hw ay  12 one point we have to crawl beneath a ten-ton boulder to get through. Where  the hole opens up, the path winds to the north side onto a narrow fl ange  of slickrock which the pioneers called Uncle Ben’s Dugway after the man  who’d come up with the idea of chiseling out a corner wide enough for the  wagons’ inside wheels and then extending the road out from the steep face  with planks and rip-rap supported by oak stakes driven into boreholes. The  boreholes are still there.  Scott and Julie are swimming in a bice embayment of Lake Powell by  the time I get down; though they’re not naked, it’s clear Katie Lee’s days are  over. I dunk my head in the lake, which is cool but not cold and follow the  road down twenty feet with my eyes into the light green water. The lake’s  hue grinds against the orange cliffs like mismatched gears, and the hundred- foot high, bleached-white “bathtub ring” on the red walls around us is the  clearest visible demonstration of the drought I’ve yet come across. “I’ve never been on a boat on Lake Powell,” I tell Julie and Scott, “but my  dream, long ago, was to live on a houseboat here and explore it. This lake  has more shoreline than the coast of California.” We consider trying to catch a ride on one of the powerboats that idle up the  canyon but they don’t come up to shore. We have some lunch, and I inform  Scott and Julie they’re seeing more of the road than is usually visible. They are  both studying hydrology at Colorado State and they came down here for spring  break. Scott, I discover, has a keen interest in Everett Ruess and he wants to see  Davis Gulch. We decide to meet at its head the next morning and explore it. In  the meantime, however, they don’t know where they should camp. “Where can’t you camp?” I ask, “Just pull off the road where nobody can  see you. That’s where you camp.” “It was our understanding we could only camp in designated camp- grounds,” says Scott. “Do you see any cops here?” I convince them they should camp at Cave Point, a few miles back, and  they do, and I park the Heap on an old road that comes off Hole-in-the-Rock Road near Davis Gulch and hike a mile towards that gulch in the evening.  I climb up a high ridge of “sandrock”—what the locals used to call it—have  a quick look around, watch as the distant, clouded Aquarius Plateau and  the heads of the Henry Mountains shambling north all fade to black and a  domed peak behind the Henrys, the most distant thing I can see, glows with  an orange forge light and then dims out of existence and the crags and weir- drock bluffs of the beautiful red wreck of earth on the river’s far side burn  out with the dying light. I feel strongly that those bluffs were what Everett Ruess was aiming for  when he met his destiny. </page> <page sequence="84"> Scott and Julie at Hole-in-the-Rock </page> <page sequence="85"> 19 2     H i g hw ay  12 When I walk back, the stock pond where I parked the Heap has moved  northward and I’m lost. In the faint light, the sand haycocks and waterpock- ets all look the same, just domes and shallows out to the base of Fifty Mile  Mountain. “Mais, c’est fantastique!” I say. The landmarks appear the same as they  did at the quarter-mile-long fl at where I parked the Heap but that fl at is  nowhere to be found. I trek north and fi nally drop into it, though I don’t  recognize it until I see the Heap half-hidden behind a dome, and even as I  approach it, it vanishes and then peeks out from behind another dome and  then another. “I’m not leading this expedition,” I tell Scott and Julie early the next  morning. They’re not impressed by my story. They have a compass and youthful  enthusiasm, and they convince me to write down the descriptions of the hike  in my notebook and we set out. I take a bearing on the cliff line behind us,  Fifty Mile Point, with a tiny arch on top, which would probably look about  the same if we were miles off course. We cross the side canyon perpendicular to Davis Gulch, which is much  further down the “trail” than we expected, and I convince Julie that she and  Scott should hike down into the narrows, since she’s never been in a slot  canyon before. I stay above and follow their progress and shout reassuring  words like “It looks like it gets deeper ahead,” and “I don’t see any way out,”  and “Maybe you should turn back now” until I lose contact with them, but I  walk back a half-mile and we meet up again near the top of the narrows. “There was a drop-off,” says Scott, “And I thought there might be more  up ahead, so we came back.” Never go alone, I think. When you take friends with you, sometimes you  get exposed to this kind of rational thinking. We continue. The cattle trail doesn’t materialize so we just keep the gulch  in view. Once in a while we come across a cairn and occasionally we can fol- low it to another, but for the most part we’re operating on faith.  Water-fi lled potholes have green blobs in them the size and shape of car- rot-sticks cut in half. On closer inspection they turn out to be cutworms  bloated up a thousand times their original size. We fi nd an arch sloped from  an old dune to the rock plain—only a foot tall and four feet wide but it quali- fi es—and I name it “Scott and Julie Arch.” Lambrechtse says to watch for a “vertical cleft” in the fl at mesa top  across the canyon (165). Scott makes noises about how far we’ve already  hiked and that leads to a discussion about the water situation, the late hour  and the generally unreliable nature of guidebooks, but I convince the two  </page> <page sequence="86"> Ha r d  R o a d s     19 3 I can see that cleft, which I really think I can, not too far ahead. It turns  out I’m right, though there aren’t as many cairns around to confi rm our  location as we were led to believe there would be and there’s still no obvi- ous cattle trail. The slickrock fl ows across the overhung walls and into the  gulch and after lunch we follow it, lose the trail and fi nd it and crawl the  last hundred feet down a thin rock spur that slants to near verticality at  the base. We all wonder how you could get cows down that last section, or horses  or burros, for that matter, without actually pushing them. What was the at- trition rate?  Right away we come across some Indian art, though it’s not the negative  pictographs I was expecting, and it’s too abstract for us to make heads or  tails of: lines, contours, depictions of weather fronts. From these we hike  upstream towards the narrows and Bement Arch, a.k.a. Nemo Arch, with  Scott up ahead setting a grueling pace, and Julie, who has never complained,  growing weaker with each step, and me in last place watching for alcoves  with ruins in them and more art. I spot a few likely candidates for cliff dwell- ings but we don’t have the time to explore them. Patrick Diehl and Tori  Woodard weren’t kidding, I note, when they told me I’d need at least two  days to explore this canyon. Black-stained walls tower and enfold. I see why few locals hold much  stock in the theory Everett fell to his death down here. There are three sets  of Moqui steps to the rim but the fi rst party apparently searched carefully  beneath them, and beneath all the alcove ruins. Otherwise, there aren’t too  many places to climb. On the other hand, the gorge is fi lled from one side to the other with sand  dunes, sand hills and sandruns, and a few months passed between Ruess’s  disappearance and the searchers’ arrival. It’s possible a slide could have bur- ied his body in the meantime. One other thing becomes clear as we hike upcanyon through the tamarisk  and willows: it’s been years since cattle grazed here. This is the fi rst time I’ve  seen the foliage so thick on the creek bottom, and Scott compares the grassy  slopes to a golf course, which is ironic because golf had its beginnings on  Scottish rangelands. I’d been pestering the BLM to show me some examples of overgrazed  range and I’d been seeing them all along, every time I hiked up some hid- den canyon with some soil in it and running water. Davis Gulch, I realize,  is the fi rst creek bottom I’ve seen that’s anywhere close to its pristine state,  and even this place is only recovering. With no cattle trampling down the  stream banks and eating and trampling the vegetation holding the soil in  </page> <page sequence="87"> 19 4     H i g hw ay  12 place, the banks are narrowing, except where beavers have ponded the fl ow  with their dams. Where it runs, the water is so clear I’m tempted to take a  drink. Sedges and young cottonwoods are reclaiming the hillsides. There are frogs on the muddy banks. An owl swoops over us from a notch  in the rock, the fi rst one Scott and Julie and I have seen in this corner of the  West. Davis Canyon switches back a half-dozen times and we don’t seem to be  any closer to the arch, which I assure Scott and Julie is “huge—you can’t  miss it.” Scott waits up and reminds me of the long walk ahead of us, the  steep hike out of the canyon and I convince him we should keep going for  another two bends in the canyon and he takes off to scout the terrain like a  long-distance runner and twenty minutes and three bends later, we hear him  shouting his discovery ahead.  Nemo Arch is a sandstone slab propped against a wall; a vaulted arch, and  it doesn’t reach down to the fl oor of the gulch as I’d expected so we have to  climb up to it. We drink the last of our water at the base and hike into the  boulder fi eld beneath it and pose for photographs and we search a little for  a “NEMO” inscription which I mistakenly believe is nearby and walk into a  deep cut-back in the cliff at the same level as the arch, where I expect to and  do fi nd a standing Fremont or Anasazi wall and the fallen remains of a good- sized pueblo, and then we start back for the cattle trail, with Scott setting a  maniacal pace because we’re running out of daylight. Julie and I quickly fall behind. If I was fi fteen years younger I still couldn’t  have kept up. I do know from previous experience that we wouldn’t have  much trouble making it back in twilight or darkness, and I do know I’m  nowhere near my own limits if I take it easy, but I can’t convince Scott to  slow down. I’m worried about Julie, who doesn’t have much experience at  this sort of thing. I tell her to let me know if she starts to feel lightheaded or  sick and I tell her not to push herself at all. I’ve already mentioned that we  can drink from the stream if we have to. “Perhaps we shouldn’t have been so ambitious,” I admit to Julie, “This is  a ten-mile hike. It’s my fault.” “Oh come on,” she croaks, “I’m having a great time.” Scott, who is carrying Julie’s pack, waits for us at the base of the sandstone  column that’s supposed to be a cattle trail and as soon as he sees we’re all- right, scurries up and out of sight. I want to kill him. Julie scoots up on her  hands and knees and I just slog. Again, Scott waits at the top until we arrive  and then he takes off. Julie falls to the rock and pantomimes squeezing a  device next to her mouth, and then she points at Scott.  “Scott!” I shout, “I think you’ve got Julie’s asthma medication in your  pack!” </page> <page sequence="88"> Ha r d  R o a d s     19 5 Soon enough after Julie takes a hit on the inhaler, the color returns to her  face and we continue on, together. We decide we should get to know each  other better, exchange medical information and other vital facts, but soon  we’re philosophizing.  “What’s the most important problem facing our society?” asks Scott. “I don’t know,” I say, “I mostly worry about making next month’s rent.” “Well, yes,” says Scott, nonplussed, “but I think it’s our environment.” Scott and Julie want to fi nd a cheap way to desalinize ocean water. Julie  wants to save the Great Lakes before pollution turns them into sludge. She  further reveals that reservoirs are ugly to her. She likes to see rivers and  streams fl owing free. “Don’t say that in town,” I tell her, “You’ll get shot.” Julie also tells me she would like to see some examples of cryptogamic  soil. “You just walked through some,” I tell her. She is horrifi ed and promises to do something wonderful for the environ- ment to make up for this transgression. Again, Scott gets out ahead, and I know what he’s thinking. His eyesight  is keen, he can probably see the cars from where we are, miles away, he  knows we’re going to intercept the road about a mile north of them, so he  wants get to them before we do and drive the car up to meet us. And why  not? Julie is breathing all right and Scott looks like he could hike another  twenty miles and not even be winded. Soon he’s a speck on the rock. We dunk our heads in the waterpockets and trudge. We fi nd the paths of  least resistance. Julie has to rest for a few minutes to get her breath back and  I try to convince her to slow her pace even more. I’ve got a fl ashlight and I  don’t care if we get back at two in the morning.  Fifty Mile Point looms over us. I’m convinced we’ve come to the last  grade before the road, but Julie is tired and her back is beginning to bother  her and she’s not convinced of anything, so I go delirious, decide I have to  save us both and run up to the top of the slope while Julie loses her foot- ing and slides down a slickrock face towards a drop-off and arrests her fall  just inches short of it. I lay on the shelf with my lungs heaving in massive  sucking spasms and then I go back down and fi nd her and lead her up to the  sagebrush bench and Hole-in-the-Rock Road, and soon we hear the whine  of the red car’s engine approaching. It all works out. We drink deeply and drive back to Escalante at night and stop at a service  station to refi ll the water bottles. I call my wife Sarah in Salt Lake City and  fi nd out I’d set the date on my watch wrong and it’s the fourteenth, not the  thirteenth. I’ve missed my brother-in-law’s wedding and everybody hates  </page> <page sequence="89"> 19 6     H i g hw ay  12 me, but they’ll be glad to hear I’m alive. My mother and my wife contacted  the sheriff’s department and they’re going to initiate a search in the morn- ing, but I make another call and put a stop to that real quick. The same  twenty-four hour waiting period that almost got Doctor Diehl killed saved a  lot of good people from wasting their time fi nding me. Julie and Scott want to buy me dinner for dragging them all over the far  end of the desert, but I don’t think there’s anything open this late. They’ve  got to be at Bryce the next morning and I’ve got places to be as well, so we  say our goodbyes and go our separate ways, and I append my rules about  traveling in this desert again:  Expect to be late. You won’t be disappointed. The Lower Road East of Escalante, Highway 12 rides along the edge of Alvey Wash and  turns northeast onto sage- and juniper- and pinyon-covered Big Flat, where  Hole-in-the-Rock Road takes off like a shot for that notch on the far side  of the Escalante drainage, and it covers the fl at more or less in two straight  lines: northeast and then almost due east to the Head-of-the-Rocks. This  was the easiest section of the lower Escalante-Boulder Road for the Civil- ian Conservation Corps to build, but the diffi culties multiplied on the fl at’s  east end where the world drops away and the road cuts abruptly to the right  and south and signs drop the speed limit to thirty and warn of an eight  percent grade and then a big yellow sign like an internet pop-up blocks  out the fantastic scenery—the incised tableland where Phipp’s Wash, The  Gulch, Death Hollow and Horse Canyon wend their devious ways to the  Escalante, and the Circle Cliffs beyond them and then Capitol Reef and  the Henry Mountains, and, far away, that last peak beneath the Henrys, the  Abajo Mountains. But you should focus more on the sign than the tableau of  red, white and black earth, breaks, fl ats and mountains at this point or you  and your passengers will take a headlong plunge over the white edge of Big  Flat and fi nd a new short-cut to Phipp’s Pasture.  You can gawk at the scenery less than a mile down the road, where there’s  a turnout that was initially built for slower traffi c—you have to cut across the  oncoming lane in an instant and you’ll have to do the same at the Boynton  Overlook—and when you’ve had your fi ll of scenery (I never have), you come  down the Head-of-the-Rocks switchbacks cut into the ubiquitous Navajo  Sandstone to the sandy pasture where the road straightens its back again for  a few miles before taking another ninety-degree right turn at the Overlook,  where the red domes of Wingate Sandstone begin to predominate, and then  plunging down and curving around the Kiva Koffeehouse, built by Brad  Boman, the man who invented “Bomanite” concrete, who moved here from  </page> <page sequence="90"> Ha r d  R o a d s     19 7 The edge of Big Flat Carmel, California, in the seventies, down to the fuzz-crowned cottonwoods  and the shaded Escalante River where the Fremont built their dwellings and  chipped and painted their idols on the stone. Then the road climbs again through Calf Creek Canyon, beneath red  ledgerock and overhangs, past the turn-off to Calf Creek Campground and  up a fourteen percent grade to a dugway and into the Navajo Sandstone  again, to the top of Haymaker Bench, where the sandstone is nearly com- pletely covered with black volcanic boulders carried down from the Aquarius  Plateau by glaciers a little over one hundred thousand years ago, and then  out onto the Hogback where the earth falls away into Calf Creek on the  west and Dry Hollow on the east and you’re clinging to a narrow, winding  two-lane road bowed down to each edge with no guardrail on either side.  Here again, you might want to stop and enjoy the scenery—fi rst glimpses  of the green pastures of Lower Boulder, the black arc of the Aquarius, the  bent, backwasted white ruiniform insanity where Death Hollow cuts into  the Escalante Anticline on the west, and similar crazyrock canyons on the  east—and soon there are some pull-outs to accommodate you. Otherwise,  there’s not much room to park. Twelve touches down again on New Home Bench and within a couple  miles a road peels off to the west, bound for Salt Gulch and Hell’s Backbone.  Then the highway curls up around Dry Hollow and Boulder Creek which  run parallel to each other, jogs right, curves left and drops into Boulder. Highway 12 is the ridge and the ravine, the canyon fl oor and the mesa  top. </page> <page sequence="91"> 19 8     H i g hw ay  12 “I doubted Truman Lyman when he told me this was an old road, and now  you’re doubting me,” says Doctor Jerry Roundy as we pick our way down  a slope that’s covered with landslide debris, towards Dry Hollow. “You’re  thinking how much things can change in one-hundred years, and they do.” Jerry and his wife are the last Roundys left in Escalante. There used to be  several Roundy families; it was a big name in these parts, right up there with  the Heaps, Griffi ns, Halls, Barneys, Twitchells, Allens, Schows, Shurtzes,  Listons, Kings, Spencers, Woolseys and Alveys, but now the Roundys are  practically extinct here. Jerry wanted to stay on the family ranch but his fa- ther, Wallace Napoleon Roundy, a forest ranger who’d gone to Washington  and worked on the Taylor Grazing Act, convinced him to get out of town  and see the world and get an education, because the government was cutting  grazing back on the open range even then, so he joined the navy and then  went on a mission for the Mormon Church and then got a masters degree  from Brigham Young University in political science and history, and later  earned a Ph.D. in western American history at the same institution, and he  taught for the LDS Church for thirty-three years and then moved back to  town near where he’d grown up and wrote the book on its history: Advised  Them to Call the Place Escalante. After his fi rst wife, Colleen passed away,  Jerry married Sheree, who had also grown up in Escalante and whose great  grandmother, Mary Alice Barker Shurtz, was the fi rst European-American  to set foot in the Escalante Valley. Jerry is a half-foot shorter than me, just like most people his age who  grew up in this part of the country (Arnold Alvey, Wallace Ott and Larry  Davis are all “short” from my point of view and Jerry and Alvey are also  bowlegged, like me). He’s got a fl at boxer’s nose, though it looks inherited  rather than acquired, and a white head of hair. He and I are locating all the  roads which preceded Highway 12 between Escalante and Boulder, the ones  he’s already been over a dozen times, and there are quite a few. The fi rst  ones were the Indian trails the Mormon militia and Thompson and some  earlier prospectors followed on their way east through here, and then there  were other Indian trails across Death Hollow, but the wagon trails mostly  came through approximately where Highway 12 is now. Approximately. The  fi rst “road” cut across present-day Highway 12 from north to south on Big  Flat and swung out past another totem known as Chimney Rock, still visible  from the highway, to the south end of Head-of-the-Rocks, where it skirted  a Navajo Sandstone fi n and dropped into Phipps Wash some distance from  its head and then emptied out into the Escalante, where the “road” ended.  In 1895, Amasa and Roseannah Lyman and their children and horses and a  pig became the fi rst to take a wagon down this route and then on to Boulder,  but they had to disassemble the wagon at the base of Haymaker Bench and  </page> <page sequence="92"> Ha r d  R o a d s     19 9 haul it up in pieces, and reassemble it for the rest of the rough trip over the  bench and down into Boulder Creek and out to Boulder itself. It took them  fi ve days to get from one town to the next, whereas I’ve made the journey in  the Heap in thirty minutes fl at.  As Jerry says in his book, “Amasa’s successful journey from Escalante to  Boulder inspired the settlers in Boulder to construct a road from Boulder to  the Haymaker ranch on the Escalante River. . . . This became known as the  Boulder Road and served as the main wagon road between Escalante and  Boulder for many years” (140). Around the turn-of-the-century the pioneers engineered the Second  Road which dropped off a dugway just north of the present Head-of-the- Rocks Overlook and crossed the modern highway and went almost straight  down into Phipps Pasture, and crossed it west of Highway 12 and then  switched back east to the Boynton Overlook and followed a ledge down to  the Escalante River. Then, in the mid-twenties, according to Doctor Roun- dy, the third road, the Cream Cellar Road, was carved in switchbacks out of  the north end of Head-of-the-Rocks. It’s route was something of a mirror image of the modern highway and it got its name from the cellar at the top of  the Head-of-the-Rocks where cream brought up by mule from Boulder was  stored until trucks could haul it off to Holt’s Osiris Creamery. Turn north off  Highway 12 just before it drops off Big Flat and walk over the hill and you  can see the remains of the cellar and the road cuts down to the pasture. Walk  north from the Head-of-the-Rocks pull-off about three hundred yards and  you’ll fi nd the remains of the dugway from the Second Road coming down  to the highway from the hill with the radio relay on it. Walk west from the  road the BLM has closed south of the pull-off, at the top of the switchbacks,  and you’ll fi nd Chimney Rock, where the original road passed on its way to  Little Spencer Flat; all the roads came through this area. They also came through what’s now known as the Boynton Overlook.  While you’re at the overlook reading one account of how Washington  Phipps shot and killed his one-time partner John Boynton, the cuts for  the Second Road and the Cream Cellar Road, which join together about a quarter-mile back, will be directly behind and above you. Walk back up  Highway 12 a quarter-mile and you’ll see the cut for the Cream Cellar Road  curving around a red fi n north of the present road, making for Head-of- the-Rocks along the slope above the Escalante River. It’s still in good shape,  makes a nice trail with views comparable to those of the new highway, and if  you were to shove the rocks off it, you could probably drive a Jeep up it. Jerry also shows me around Escalante: the chimney and the cellar and  the swimming pool and maintenance shed and the warped boards in a fi eld  which are the remains of CCC Camp FS-42. He lived just down the block  </page> <page sequence="93"> 2 0 0   H i g hw ay  12 The Cream Cellar Road from here when he was a boy and  the workers, many of whom had  never been outside New York  and Chicago and the other east- ern cities where they’d grown  up, would pay him a nickel to  ride his mare.  “I was rolling in money,” he  says. Sheree’s mother used to  teach reading and writing to the  men; some had joined the CCC  unable to even sign their own  names. One night Jerry’s father  allowed some of the CCC boys  to sleep in beds that had been  moved out on their lawn—a  common practice in the sum- mer months—and in the morning, Jerry’s mother fed them stacks of pan- cakes and eggs and bacon.  “Word spread,” says Jerry, “And then we had all these CCC guys sleeping  at our place.” In his book, Roundy says those boys who slept out in the open, “couldn’t  believe there were so many stars in the sky” (195). After I’ve had the tour, after Jerry has shown me all the old alignments of  all the old roads and told me where I could fi nd Thompson’s Turnover, where  Willis Thompson fl ipped and wrecked his wagon when he took a curve too  fast and left it where it lay, and Peters’ Whip-up, where James Peters failed  to persuade his balking horse team to pull his wagon up a grade, and the  Lollipop Tree in Phipp’s Pasture, which still has a lollipop shape, where the  Second Road changed course and headed for Boynton Overlook, and the  McInelly twist, the switchbacks James McInelly put in near the Hogback in  1915, after he’s shown me the old CCC camp and the house he grew up in,  we part ways and I head back to Calf Creek Campground to put one more  piece of this road into perspective. I’ve already hiked up to Lower Calf Creek  Falls, the high, clear ribbon unraveling into mist and rainbows a few miles upcanyon from the campground, and I’ve studied the petroglyphs on the  walls but there’s one I missed high on the cliffs, the most important one, the  dark fi gure. No trail goes to it so you have to make your own way, and I do:  I climb off the worn trail and scramble up red ledges while a few tourists  </page> <page sequence="94"> Ha r d  R o a d s     2 01 look on disapprovingly, to a Navajo Sandstone wall where the dark fi gure  awaits. He has no arms or legs or eyes and his body is a black wedge and he  has horns like a bull. I have seen him before, seen him in some dream, met  him on some ethereal plane. I know this demonic visage, though I don’t  know his name. His two horns are the oppositions of things: up/down,  good/evil, male/female, right and left, pointing to each other. This idol is  the heart of Highway 12. The Upper Road FS 153 is Hell’s Backbone Road, usually impassible in winter, but it’s been an- other dry year and the road hasn’t been closed off. I come up from the Escalan- te side, pass by a few empty  logging trucks that must be- long to contractors working  for Steed, skate through a few  patches of snow at the onset,  which make me wonder how it  is further up. To the right, the  Escalante Monocline is a long  white shield wall with a hole  in it where that meek little  trickle of Pine Creek bashes  through fi ve hundred feet of  solid Navajo Sandstone to run  along the roadside. To the left  are the scaly Black Hills and  Skull Spring and Lost Creek,  bad portents, all. FS 154 branches off for  the plateau top, Posey Lake  and Cyclone Lake, the Awapa  Plateau, and Bicknell, even- tually, but I keep right and  fi nd more snow, stretches of  snow hundreds of yards long,  especially where the trees  have shaded the road from  the southern sun, so I take it  Chimney from the CCC camp near Escalante </page> <page sequence="95"> 2 0 2   H i g hw ay  12 Ghost figures at Calf Creek slow, put on slow music, some Brahms, a collection called “Songs Ring out  to the Heavens,” which is appropriate because my side-view mirror has been  knocked back so I can keep my eye on the drift clouds, so I can watch the  sky. Pretty soon I’m in a forest of ponderosa and limber pine, fi rs, scrub  oak, rabbitbrush on the roadside, and yellow signs warning me to keep my  eyes on the road. The sandstone is gone and black and red andesites and  trachytes and black clinkers have taken its place. Boulder Mountain is a  “pseudo-mountain,” which means it was carved out of the landscape, left  standing by “circumdenudation,” as Dutton put it, rather than pushed up  by tectonic forces or built up by volcanic eruptions. The volcanic cap, one  to two thousand feet thick, is why the Aquarius Plateau is still here. And when the cap is removed, the unprotected Navajo Sandstone is  downwasted like a deep wound. Death Hollow came into being from the  desire of Mamie Creek’s Right Fork to get even with the surrounding ter- rain, four thousand feet beneath the Mountain, as quickly as possible. Hell’s Backbone Road gets its name from the knife-edge ridge that runs  above Sand Creek. A CCC crew from Camp FS-18 at Blue Spring Ridge set  up a spike camp near Hell’s Backbone to build a bridge across the narrowest  section. At one point in the construction it was necessary to move a com- pressor over to the other side of the gorge. As Jerry Roundy puts it, perhaps the most daring feat was performed by local man, Loral “Sixty” McI- nelly. Loral was not a CCC enrollee but a local LEM (Local Experienced  </page> <page sequence="96"> Ha r d  R o a d s     2 0 3 Man) who had been hired because of his bulldozer driving skills. . . . When the  compressor arrived, the main stringers were in place but the decking had not  yet been completed. The stringers were two huge saw logs that grew close to  the place where the bridge was to be built and had been felled in place almost  across the span. They were winched into place and the tops were hewed fl at. .  . . Upon closer examination of the situation, it was discovered that the tracks  of the Caterpillar tractor and the wheels of the compressor fi t the stringers. . .  . In order to protect the driver in case of a mishap, a cable was strung overhead  between two huge pine trees from which a rope and a shoulder harness was  suspended and secured to the driver. Then at least if the Caterpillar had gone  over the side, the driver would have been left dangling safely (?) in mid-air. . . . Loral was an excellent “cat-skinner” and cautiously made his way across the  chasm with the compressor as everyone held their breath. As the cat pulled  onto the other side, a huge  cheer went up from the on- lookers. (186-187) They fi nished the job in  fi ve and one-half weeks with  no mishaps. I always have to toss a few  stones off the bridge when I  come through here, hike out  to the edge to see into the  deep cuts, peer down at the  bottom of oblivion.  Past the ridge there’s snow  on the road for miles, so I put  it in four-wheel-drive, crawl  down switchbacks in tracks  too wide for the Heap so it  gets slung all over the road  until the snow cover breaks.  I spot a few old overgrown  haul roads back in the woods  and come to an aspen stand  where every local has in- scribed his name and some of  the dendroglyphs are so old  and distorted by tree growth  The idol of Highway 12 </page> <page sequence="97"> 2 0 4   H i g hw ay  12 that they’ve become illegible runes. From the aspens, the road drops steeply  to the isolated ranches in Salt Gulch and to fi elds of sagebrush and rabbit- brush again, and dead pines turned to rust, and the road runs back out to  Highway 12.  Death Hollow According to Jerry Roundy, the trail through Death Hollow never was the  offi cial Boulder Mail Trail. Some letters may have come over it but you  couldn’t really haul anything substantial over what he calls the Death Hol- low Trail because there wasn’t enough room; it was too steep and narrow.  This trail was the express route from Escalante to Boulder, a straight line  from one town to the next, over and under hills and dales, cliffs, washes,  whatever was in the way, and it was sixteen miles where even the modern  road runs thirty and it was fi ve hours by horseback where the original route  was fi ve days by wagon. I’ve brought along way too much equipment for this adventure and I’ll  come to know my pack as “the beast” over the next sixteen miles. I start off at  noon from the turnoff to Hell’s Backbone, next to the Boulder Airport which  is a dirt runway by an airplane fuselage mashed nose-fi rst into the ground  with a windsock on a pole bolted to it and “Boulder Airport and UFO Land- ing Site” scrawled on the side. The fi rst part of the trail drops into the head  of Sand Creek and I already have to rest after two miles, set my pack down  against a rock and fi nd a shaded, bare spot of ground amidst the rabbitbrush  and cottonwoods, tamarisk, Indian paintbrush and limber pine and listen  to the creek’s purl for a while. I wonder at that point whether I should turn  back and lighten the load. I’ve got a gallon jug and a 1.5 liter bottle of water,  which proves to be just enough for the journey; a heavy, self-infl ating sleep- ing pad which won’t defl ate anymore because embers from campfi res have  burned holes in it; a sleeping bag that must weigh ten pounds; a change of  clothes; a couple cans of tuna; some chips; and miscellany like a fi re grate  and guidebooks and other items that probably add about fi fteen pounds of  weight. I bought the external-frame backpack, a Kelty which must be at least  twenty-fi ve years old, at Deseret Industries, a thrift store, for fi ve dollars.  Suppose I were to use pine boughs in place of the pad and replace the sleep- ing bag with a blanket and build and feed a big fi re to stay warm through the  night? Suppose I try to do all sixteen miles in one stretch tomorrow without  a heavy pack? But I decide to continue, hoping my body will adjust as I go. The trail hooks up with the Forest Service telephone line that was strung  along trees between Boulder and Escalante in 1910 and the trail stays with  the line down to Escalante. Lose your way and you can pick up the route  again by following the line, which is good because the trail is often nothing  more than a row of cairns. </page> <page sequence="98"> Ha r d  R o a d s     2 0 5 Death Hollow I meet isolated groups of backpackers coming the other way, the wrong  way as far as I’m concerned: uphill. Two of them are in their sixties, having  a hard time of it but they’re managing, which puts me to shame. I rest often  during that afternoon but make ten miles with this monster on my back.  The views on the top of the trail are wide open to the dim and distant Henry  Peaks and Navajo Mountain and there’s a pleasant breeze winding through  the ponderosa and over the manzanita fl ats that keeps the gnats off me. I  come to the Slickrock Saddle and gaze into the abyss, the chasm that’s still  dark with the sun nearly overhead, and I hike down the blasted-out dugways,  down the switchbacks where cattleman John King slipped on ice one night  and dangled for a moment or two over Death Hollow by the bridle of his  braced horse, to the river bed and I rest for a while in the cool shadows.  Like most photographers in southern Utah, I’ve become fascinated with  desert varnish, long vertical black and red streaks on the rock walls, oxida- tions and mineral precipitations, minerals fi xed to the surface through or- ganic action. These patterns are like absorption and emission lines; it’s as if  some distant star had transmitted and fi ltered its light, the inimitable record  of its size and age, directly onto the walls of this canyon. And this canyon, Death Hollow, has the most impressive streaks of desert  varnish I’ve seen anywhere, and not just impressive for their size but the  variety of their sizes, shapes and hues: puce and mauve and a shimmering  </page> <page sequence="99"> 2 0 6   H i g hw ay  12 red ocher just the color of blood. Hematite and hemoglobin have the same  Greek root, and that’s because our blood gets its color from the same ele- ment which precipitates from the sandstone walls, iron. Every red blood cell  has four iron atoms to bind four oxygen molecules and blood turns a rust  brown as it coagulates because it is literally rusting, oxidizing, as it dries.   I use a lot of fi lm getting pictures of those walls and I fi nd myself wan- dering down past the turnoff point and I pay for it when I slip on a stone in  midstream and dunk my pack into the water. My clothes are saturated and  the sleeping bag gets wet but my camera stays dry in the butt-pack and so do  my books, which are on top of the backpack. I also jam my right thumb into  a rock as I’m fl ailing around, so fairly soon I can’t use it. Back I go to the trail, through ferns and horsetails that resonate a Paleo- zoic presence, and up the side of Death Hollow until I can view the weird- ness downstream, the whaleskin walls and white fi ns squeezed up to mono- lithic heights, like the temples of Zion National Park, which is the next spot  west where the Navajo Sandstone appears after it dives into the earth at the  Escalante Monocline.  When I pause near the top of the hollow I’m instantly set on by gnats and  the attack inspires me to invent the gnat count, the number of gnats in a given  volume in any particular environment, which could be tacked onto the end  of the weather report like a pollen count. Up on top, a zephyr throws the gnats off and sets the frame of my pack  humming like a fl ute. Dark clouds roll over the sun and the light leeches  away and I come down from a fl at into the sand wash of Mamie Creek where  I will spend the night. My guidebooks call Death Hollow a “moderate” hike,  but my shoulders are about to separate and I wouldn’t notice if they did  because my upper body has gone numb with shock. Want to know how  a packhorse felt about the pioneer experience? Strap on a fi fty or seventy  pound pack and hike over the Death Hollow Trail. I collect some fi rewood with one hand and lay out the sleeping bag, which  is dry inside where my intermediate bag with its cotton/polyester blend cover would be dripping wet, so I have to add water resistance to the list of  benefi ts you get with synthetics. It’s May and it’s not likely to get too cold  tonight but pretty soon I’ve got an inferno burning next to me anyway, and  I rest and cook my dinner on the grate and peruse my guidebooks by the  fi relight, which is ironic because this is how they read. What is more traditional than a campfi re? Yet the arrival at that perfect camp- site can be ruined by the numerous fi re rings already there. When you hike  in the spring and the fall, the need for warmth can easily be provided for by  extra clothing and a good supper. The reality that a campfi re is not a necessity  </page> <page sequence="100"> Ha r d  R o a d s     2 0 7 Desert varnish, Death Hollow is a diffi cult ethic to convey. Hopefully the reason you are here is because this  area offers unique wilderness experiences. On a more practical level, evaluate  the time spent gathering fi rewood, digging a pit, burning your dinner, etc.,  compared to spending that time reading, listening and observing. Due to the  damage associated with campfi res, the National Park Service is considering  establishment of “stoves only” zones in fragile or heavily used parts of the  canyon system. (Lambrechtse, 12) And there’s more: Fires: Campfi res can no longer be tolerated in the wilderness setting. They do  an immense amount of damage to the land. Not only are the blackened rocks  of a fi re ring ugly, the charcoal and ash residues seem to last forever. Fire rings  demarcate campsites and tend to draw people to them. This promotes over- use. Use a light-weight stove for cooking and a candle lantern as a gathering  beacon for nighttime socializing (Allen, 18). I pile some more logs on the fi re—I’ve got an ample supply, enough to  last all night—and record some thoughts here.  First off, perhaps fi res are a necessity. Hang over a stove fi re and your  clothes will smell of butane or propane. Smell is the original and most </page> <page sequence="101"> 2 0 8   H i g hw ay  12 primal of the fi ve senses; the receptors in our noses are wired directly to the  emotional centers of our brains and the smell of burning ponderosa or ce- dar stirs something quite pleasing in those deep-down nexuses of our lizard  minds. Also, campfi res get the gnats off you right now. Second, if your wilderness experience is ruined by an old campfi re ring  or any other single artifact of man, you may need professional help. There  is a high probability you will not be the fi rst person to go anywhere on this  earth, and you may just have to acknowledge that fact. Third, I can read while my dinner is cooking and not burn it. This comes  with practice. Further along in one guidebook: The meticulous practice of “leave-no-trace” camping technique can help spare  the land; but this is no longer enough. We must now become our brother’s  keeper. . . . Insensitive hikers can no longer be tolerated. It is our obligation to  help educate those who do not know and to chastise those who do know but  do not care (Allen, 14).  When I skim through the introductions, they are full of “musts” and  “don’ts.” I believe that if you want the wilderness to remain in an absolutely  pristine condition you don’t write a guidebook about it. A friend of mine, an environmentalist, once confi ded to me that it was  impossible to “leave no trace” unless you stayed entirely out of the wilder- ness. Are you going to scratch your tracks out as you go? Reset the twigs you  snapped as you struggled through the brush? Carry the rocks you dislodged  coming down a switchback to their former position and try to orient them as  they were before? My motto is “don’t make too much of a mess,” and I know  it doesn’t have the same cachet as “leave no trace” but it works. I burn my  garbage in the fi re and pack out anything unsightly like black plastic that’s  been left alive. I’ll use an old fi re ring before I construct my own and an old  campsite before I clear a new one, and I won’t make a fi re ring unless the  wind is high and the timber is dry and I don’t want to start a confl agration,  and if conditions are absolutely right for a forest or range fi re, I won’t build  a fi re at all.  Having recorded these opinions, I am now free to enjoy the night and the  solitude and dwell on other things and let the fi re die down to a simple blaze  and sleep right beneath the telephone wire until morning, when I must har- ness myself again to the beast. The next day I’ll continue my trek with my  swollen thumb and the pack seeming to weigh a great deal less, up the slope  of Mamie Creek, over the slickrock sulci past Antone Flat, down a wash by  the big white “E” on the side of the Escalante Monocline and into Escalante  itself. The hardest part, as I’d been warned by a few fellow hikers back in  </page> <page sequence="102"> Ha r d  R o a d s     2 0 9 Death Hollow, will be to fi nd a ride back up to the turnoff to Hell’s Back- bone, but tomorrow I will fi nally get together with a couple from Ann Arbor,  Michigan, headed for the Burr Trail, trying to see all of the Southwest in a  week, and they’ll get me close enough to where I can walk back to the Heap.  Tonight I’m comfortable and warm and only separated from the earth by  an inch of foam padding and a few layers of plastic and as my mind tips into  the night, even those barriers vanish. </page> </plain_text>
