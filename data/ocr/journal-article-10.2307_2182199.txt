<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXISTENCE AND NATURE OF GOD. Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Association, Volume XXVIII. Washington, Catholic University of America, 1954. Pp. 282. $3.00. The reader who expects to find an outlay of essays narrowly restricted to scholastic subject matter and confined within the framework of a single point of view will be definitely surprised by the contents of this volume. The historical essays cover a wide range of topics running from the Eighth Book of Aristotle's Physics and St. Augustine's natural theology, to a penetrating Presidential Address on the treatment of God in modern philosophy. There are also a large variety of purely systematic studies, including one on the psychology of religion by Fr. Nash and an acute critique of Invalid Proofs of God's Existence by Vernon Bourke. We find a similar diversity of points of view ranging from the meta-philosophy of R. McKeon in his address on Contemporary French Philosophy, to the Franciscan and Platonic attitude of Fr. Wolter in his interesting exposition of Scotus' primary argument for the exist- ence of God, and the Aristotelianism of Vincent Smith's defense of the philosophy of nature. Many of these essays are of high quality, and we shall select a few of them for more detailed comment. James Collins, in his Presidential Address, clearly distinguishes the way in which modern philosophy, as opposed to classical and medieval thought, adopted a functional rather than a systematic approach to the problem of God. For Descartes, God was necessary to guarantee the reliability of memory and the existence of an external world. After beginning with the finite self, Descartes brought Him in to meet certain epistemological needs via the ontological argument. Spinoza questioned whether this Cartesian God, introduced almost at the beginning, could perform these far flung functions adequately. Hence he substituted God for the finite self as his methodological I27</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS starting point. This meant, as Collins notes, that philosophy had to do the work traditionally allotted to theology. Instead of revelation, we have an immediate intuition into the Divine essence. When this failed to withstand serious criticism, Kant used the notion of God as a moral postulate to make the finite self free and immortal, and to harmonize nature with duty. Hegel finally exploited religion as a stage in his dialectical absolutism. It is no wonder that the collapse of these attempts has led many, like Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, to advocate a complete exclusion of theological questions from philosophy. Mr. Collins concludes rather that philosophers should "refrain from making God a mere tool of their own special view of things" (p. I 6). The whole idea of proving the existence of God is often attacked on the ground that it is either unnecessary for those who already believe, or unconvincing for those who do not. Peter W. Nash considers this dilemma in the light of religious aspiration in the concrete, as exempli- fied in such figures as Augustine, Tolstoi, and Oscar Wilde. He concludes that the dilemma is based on a sharp separation of theory from practice which is not true to the facts of life. It is true that syllo- gistic demonstrations will be unconvincing to one who has had no practical experience of human futility and the meaninglessness of life without a final end. But human aspiration is directed toward a goal which must be understood in some way, with some degree of clarity. If this is clouded by confusion and error, the whole drive may be blocked. The first horn of the dilemma fails to recognize the many interim steps and stages of belief. It is here that theory may play a crucially important role "within a framework of appetitive drives" (P. 74). Realistic thinkers have recently shown a strong tendency to abandon physical arguments in favor of metaphysical demonstrations based on the real distinction between essence and existence. Vincent Smith gives an interesting defense of the opposite position. He not only holds that the Aristotelian argument from motion is basically sound, but also that it is necessarily presupposed by any "real distinction of essence and existence" (p. 9i). This last thesis, however, is subject to serious question, as the real distinction has been defended, without recourse to such argument, solely on the ground of existential pluarality or the contingency of changing entities. Fr. Wolter has written a clear and detailed exposition of Duns Scotus' demonstration as it is presented in the new critical edition of his Commentary on the Sentences. Two causes are essentially ordered if (a) they are contemporaneous; (b) the exercise of causality in the lower depends I28</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS on the higher; and (c) the higher is more perfect. Scotus first argues that an infinite regress of such essentially ordered causes is impossible, on the ground that without a first, the whole series would be left uncaused. He maintains that a first uncaused cause is possible. In a crucial step, he then holds that only what exists virtually in its causes can be possible without being actual. Hence if that which has no cause is possible, it must be actual. Ab oportere ad esse valet illatio (p. I Io). From this he deduces the infinity and unicity of this first cause. This careful statement will be of interest to students of medieval philosophy. The most penetrating of the systematic papers is on "Invalid Proofs of God's Existence," by Vernon J. Bourke. Thus he puts his finger on the weak step in Scotus' complex argument,-the passage from an uncaused essence to actual existence (pp. 42-43). There is nothing illogical about such an argument. But logic alone tells us nothing of the existence or nonexistence of such wonderful essences. "No addi- tion of possibilities will give us an actuality" (p. 43). The Augustinian inference from timeless logical truth to a real eternal cause is subject to the same objection. Mr. Bourke shows that the Kantian type of moral argument which attempts to deduce a supreme rewarder and punisher from the awareness of binding obligation (cf. the paper on "The Moral Argument for God's Existence" by John P. Rock) is open to similar criticism. If obligation is interpreted as a psychological experience, we are inferring extramental from mental being (p. 45). But the two are different. On the other hand if we interpret obligation as natural tendency, its "goal" becomes too polyvalent and equivocal to justify any such metaphysical inference. Hume distorts the classical teleological argument by comparing the universe to a machine. "Teleological order is not simply the arrange- ment of a machine; in fact, the ordering of means to end often appears as mechanical disorder" (p. 47). Indeed no one of the three demonstra- tions criticized by Kant in his Critique corresponds to any classical causal argument, and each is not only subject to the objections raised by Kant but to others as well. Thus the watchmaker argument leads only to an anthropomorphic agency, not to a transcendent Deity. The critical studies by McTighe and Kendzierski on "The Finite God in Modern Thought" also derserve to be mentioned for their accuracy and penetrating criticism. This volume is not only a mine of historical information but of systematic argument as well. It deserves the careful attention of serious students of philosophy, whatever their point of view may be.
