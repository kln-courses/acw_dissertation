<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS Israel was host to the seventh interna tional congress for the history of science which met at Jerusalem from 4th to 11th August 1953- Nearly two hun dred scientists attended the congress, of whom almost half represented about a dozen foreign countries. Prof. F. S. Boden heimer of Jerusalem presided. The busi ness of the congress was conducted in five sections :The History of Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Geography and Ge ology (section I); Chemistry,Mineralogy, Pharmacology and Biology (section II); Technology (section III); Medical Sci ences (section IV), History of Science in General and Methodics (section V). In addition to the plenary and sectional meetings the programme comprised visits to different scientific institutions and ex cursions to various parts of Israel. Station The first part of the rainfall year 1952 53, like its predecessor (cf. IE], 2, 1952, pp. 250-252), showed a pronounced de ficiency. But whereas in 1951 the dry spell was broken on December 13th and at many places the total of December 1951 was amongst the highest monthly totals on record, dry and sharavic weather con tinued well into January 1953, with criti cal results for certain branches of agricul ture, especially early-sown grains. The situation changed in the northern and central parts of the country in January and in the Jerusalem area and the Negev in February. The months of January, Feb ruary and March were all well above average. Particular mention may be made of the March amounts at B?er T?vya and Jerusalem, 223 mm. each, which exceed Coastal Plain, to S Nahariya Haifa, Mt. Carmel Caesarea, S'd?t Yam Tel Aviv, ha-Qirya B?er T?vya Mountain Region Safed, Mt.

The amount recorded at Jerusalem was the highest March rainfall since 1910. It was exceeded by Ma'aleh ha-Hamisha west of Jerusalem which recorded in March 325 mm. Some snow fell in March in the higher parts of the mountains, e. g. Safed and Jerusalem. Special mention must be made of the singular rainfall which occurred at E?lat during the 24 hours beginning at 20.00 hrs. on 31 March 1953, viz. 50.5 mm.! This 24 hourly amount surpassed not only the largest monthly amount hitherto re corded at E?lat, but was even larger than any annual total registered there. The rainfall season came to an early end during the first week of April after 261</page><page sequence="2">262 NOTES AND NEWS whi?h time no notable rainfall occurred. The heavy rains of January to March improved the crop situation in most parts of the country and brought about very fair and in part even good yields. In the Negev only summer crops gave a good harvest. The relaxation of intensive measures against locusts after the end of World War II led to renewed serious threats of this pest on Near Eastern countries. In the spring of 1952 serious locust inva sions were reported from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Hashemite Jordan. In Jordan wide spread infestation occurred early in April both in Eastern and in Western Palestine, followed later on by the Jebel Druze in Syria. Late in April and in May a few swarms were observed in Israel, mainly in the southern coastal plain, but they caused no serious damage.In February 1953 locusts again invaded Jordan from Saudi Arabia. Very extensive parts of Eastern Palestine and of the 'Arava were infested, including its western side in Israel. During the second half of April locusts were reported from Lake Tiberias. The only serious infestation in Israel occurred late in May and in June in the north-western Negev. A joint expedition of the Hebrew uni versity and the department of anti quities worked late in 1953 under the direction of Dr. M. Stekelis in the second season at the Kabbara cave near Zikhron Yaaqov. After ascertaining that the terrace in front of the cave did not contain archaeological remains in situ, the expedition began to work inside the cave. Two strata of Upper Palaeolithic were found, containing a great quantity of flints and animal bones; the latter included bones and teeth of bear, donkey, hyena, squirrel, etc. In the Middle Palaeolithic stratum, which is several metres thick, was found a 'floor' with remains of Mousterian culture ; on it were construc tions of rough stones, which contained smaller stones, ashes, and much bone. Near these was found the skull of a preda tory animal, and near it bones arranged deliberately, perhaps as an 'offering*. All this was separated from the general area by a row of stones. The excavators are about to start the clearing of another 'hall', of a size as yet undetermined. The Mousterian objects found are of particu larly good quality and technique. In connection with some new construc tions south-east of Beersheba, which include the site called Khirbet el-Bif?r on the banks of the Bes?r Valley, the depart ment of antiquities conducted excava tions directed by Mr. M. Dothan from January to April 1953. A small mound examined in the centre of the site was found to contain Chalcolithic remains (fourth millenium b. c). In the topmost level-were remains of rectangular build ings on foundations of rough stone blocks; the middle level contained a circular con struction 7 metres in diameter, and in the lowest level were circular pits apparently used as storage-bins. A pottery 'churn* of unusual size (decorated with purple painted stripes) and a piriform mace-head of haematite were outstanding among the very numerous small objects found. The whole settlement appears to have been relatively short-lived. The objecte</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS 263 found indicate a close relationship to Ghassulian culture, although there are forms and decorations typical of the northern Negev, or even of Kh. el Bit?r only. This is the first occurrence of a Chalcolithic settlement of so highly de veloped a standard in Western Palestine. The circular house, the largest so far found in this country, may have served as the central silo of the whole region, and thus may indicate the sedentary-agri cultural character of the population at that period (circa 34th-32nd centuries b.c.). Quite possibly the topmost level of this settlement corresponds to the 'Jez reel culture'which preceded the first stage of the Early Bronze Age in northern Israel. In October 1953 Mr. M. Dothan cleared, on behalf of the department of antiquities, a tomb accidentally discov ered in the vicinity of Tell Asawir (usually identified with Arruboth at the southern issue of the Megiddo Pass). The tomb had two distinct levels : an upper of the Hyksos Age and a lower of the end of the Chalcolithic Age or the beginning of the Bronze Age. The upper tomb was a mass burial ; it consisted of a number of skel etons with much pottery corresponding to stratum D of Tell Beit Mirsim, i.e. from the end of the 17th century to the first half of the 16th century b.c. In the lower burial the remains were indistinct, but it was evident that it was also of the mass-burial type. This level had a very great quantity of pottery which was so far typical of one place only, namely, Tell Far'a near Sichern, where it was attributed to the 'En?olithique su p?rieur' In addition to the pottery the tomb contained flints, beads and neck laces. The presence of 'grey burnished' ware, which belongs to the end of the Chal colithic period in Northern Israel, is of special interest, as it appears here together with painted ware typical of the South. The lower burial is to be attributed ap parently to the transition from Chalco lithic to the Bronze Age, i.e. ca. 3200 b.c. In April 1953 Mr.Y. Aharoni, acting on behalf of the Israel exploration society and assisted by a group of volunteers, made an exploratory sounding in the tell of Kadesh Naphtali, at a point where the modern road cuts into its slope, beginning from a brick-wall visible in the cut. The trench was 17 m. long and 1.25 m. broad, descending by steps. The debris at that spot was found to be 11 m. high.The brick wall belongs to an early stage of the Ear ly Bronze Age; it stands on a burnt level, 0.50 m. above the virgin soil; its width was 5.40 m. Floors and various installa tions were discovered all along the trench. The following strata were ascertained : Arab 3.00 m. Hellenistic 0.75 m. Iron Age I-II and Late Bronze 0.75 m. Middle Bronze 1.25 m. Early Bronze 5.25 m. Sub-strata could be defined within the main strata, especially in the big accumu lation of Early Bronze Age debris. These included a stage of Early Bronze III with Kh. Kerak Ware, Early Bronze II with combed, burnished and band-slip ware and many typical sherds of Early Bronze I. In August Mr. Y. Aharoni carried out a systematic survey of an area in Upper</page><page sequence="4">264 NOTES AND NEWS Galilei, extending from Peq?'in and Beit Jann in the south to Iqrit and el-Mansura in the north. 46 sites were examined and classified as follows : 2 artificial mounds with pottery from Early Bronze Age to the Byzantine and Arab periods. 18 Iron Age settlements. 31 sites from the Hellenistic-Roman Byzantine periods, 4 of which were settled already in the Iron Age; some of them continued to exist into the Arab period. 5 settlements were founded in the Arab period, including 3 Crusader fortresses. The Tumuli West of Jerusalem. ?Mrs. Ruth Amiran of the Department of Antiquities studied a group of small tells west and south-west of Jerusalem during June August and November, 1953, on behalf of the Israel exploration society and the department of antiquities. These small tells of regular conical shape have attracted the attention of archaeologists since the beginning of explorations in Palestine (Survey of Western Palestine, Mem. Ill, pp. 156-7; W.F.Albright, BASOR, 10,1923, p. 2). Of special interest is the relation of this singular group oftumuli to various regions in Anatolia, where burial in tumuli, a custom probably of Pontic origin, was practised by the Phry gians and by other peoples. (For a concise discussion of the problem, cf. .Bittel: Kleinasiatische Studien. Istanbul, 1942, pp. 88-100.) Fifteen tumuli of different sizes have now been mapped in this re gion; others situated nearby on the crests of the hills above Beit Jala, Deir Kirmizan and Battir seem to belong to the same group. A single one is situated in the Shephela near Har-El Excavation of one of the tumuli has revealed an enormous heap of stones, 31 m. in diameter and 6 m. high, the base of which is encircled, probably for con structional purposes, by a ring-wall form ing a polygon of 17 sides. The ring-wall is well built of dry masonry, and is composed of two, in some parts of three belts. Two entrances are cut in the ring wall; one in the east contains a staircase leading up to the inside; one in the west north-west contains two steps leading down to the inside. In the eastern quarter of the circle is a higher plateau built up by stones and earth and a retaining wall, fitting the configuration of the ground. The plateau contains a small pit of roughly hexagonal shape, an elongated knoll and a pavement. This is exacdy on the level of the highest step of the staircase which apparently led to this installation. The pit was found full of earth and small particles of coal. An extensive burning place filled with ashes and coal was found to the south of the plateau. Sherds of the last century of the Judaean Kingdom, which were found among the stones of the filling, assign the tumulus to this period. Most of the comparable material from outside Palestine obliges to ex plain this group as burial-mounds, but evidence such as the seven tumuli near Paleoskoutella in Cyprus, where cult places have been found buried under heaps of stones (Swedish Cyprus Expedition, I, pp. 416-438), should not be disregarded. Further excavation and investigations are in progress. After an interval of over a decade the excavations at Bet She'artmwete resumed by the Israel exploration society under</page><page sequence="5">NOTES the direction of Dr . Avigad. In a short season of about four week s, the excavators cleared a well-preserved gate which was discovered accidentally last year in the NW part of the town The relation of this structure to the adjacent buildings of the Late Roman and Byzantine periods was also explored; one of the rooms in the latter contained the remains of an oil press. Excavations on the lower NW slope of the town-hill resulted in the discovery of two large catacombs of the well known B?t She'ar?m type (with some slight variations), dating from the third to fourth centuries a.d. A third cata comb (second to third centuries) was, however, of a different kind ; it had a tri ple arched fa?ade built in ashlar against the rock-face. A great number of Greek inscriptions was found in these tombs, testifying to the burial of Jews from var ious cities on or near the Syrian coast, such as Antioch, Byblos, Tyre, etc. Some of these inscriptions, as well as those in Aramaic and Hebrew, show interesting new formulae ; two seem to refer to rabbis mentioned in Talmudic literature. Mr. B. Rabani excavated, on behalf Of the department OF antiquities, a Roman-Byzantine bath in the area of Roman Tiberias The part cleared in cludes two halls (10X20 and 5.5 X 9 m. respectively), both paved in coloured mosaics (partially preserved) with rep resentations of animals (elephants, leop ards, griffins, donkeys, birds and fishes) and flowers. Some of the cubes are of yellow, blue and green glass. The rest of the bath includes a brick oven (3 m. high, 2 5m long) connected with an hypocaust cellar of the usual type, with AND NEWS 265 vaults (supporting a marble pavement) resting on brick columns, and pipes passing through the latter. The upper rooms of the hypocaust had sunk and drained bath tubs, 1 m.-1.20 m. sq., some still paved with marble, others with mosaic. The minor finds included one Ju daeo-Greek and one Aramaic inscription, also some sherds inscribed with Greek letters and numerals. Part of the founda tions seem Roman. The building was used as a bath in the Byzantine period and continued to be used as such into Arabic times. At Beth-Shan, ca. 200 m. south of the Roman Theatre, Mr. N. Zori excavated on behalf of the department of antiqui ties a complex of buildings belonging to four different levels of the Byzantine period. A street and two workshops adjoining it were cleared. In one were found bones and bone objects (spindle whorls and games) and in the other heaps of tesserae. In one of the two rooms of an earlier level was found a table of green ish stone and in its stone pavement part of a Greek inscription. Underneath the pavement was a juglet with a hoard of 414 coins dating from Valentianus II (364-375) toTheodosius II (408-450). Below this to the virgin soil no earlier remains were revealed. Also at Beth-Shan, 250 m. west of the Roman Theatre, Mr. Zori excavated a complex of 22 rooms of a large Byzantine insula. Three sets of steps, rows of columns and vertical pipes point to the existence of an upper floor. A fine foun tain, near a toilet with water channels and drains, indicates the high standard of liv ing of the period. The main entrance</page><page sequence="6">266 NOTES AND NEWS (from the end of a street) was 2.36 m. wide (10 cm. less than the width of the western gate of Tell el-Hosn). Vessels, tools and other objects of pottery, bronze and iron, glass and stone were found in abundance and in a rich variety of forms and decorations.They are similar to those of the Byzantine levels of Antioch, the Beth-Shan tell, Jerusalem, Mount Nebo and in particular the royal tombs of Bal lana and Qustul in Nubia. Two more lev els have been revealed in this site be longing apparently to the 4-5th centuries a. d. Below two of the rooms of this building down to the virgin soil, Chalco lithic remains were found. Pottery (all in fragments) included jar-necks of upright shape and sharp rims, flat bases, all shapes of loop-handles. Encircling bands of pottery were roughly shaped or impressed with fingers round the loop-handles, the necks and the body of the vessels. The flint implements found with this pottery include: nuclei, arrow-heads, sickle blades, etc. The pottery is very similar to that of Beth-Shan XVIII-XVII, and especially to that of Tuleilat Ghass?l. At Bet ha-Siffah Mr. Y. Aharoni, on behalf of the department of antiquities, exca vated what appears to be a rural installa tion of the Late Byzantine or Early Arab period. It consists of a paved courtyard, with a wine press to the west, store rooms to the north and two rooms to the east, one of which was paved with mosaics and ornamented with a large cross. The pavement of the other was ornamented in a carpet-like design of small squares, each containing a different ornament, geometric or vegetal The latter room had a small apse to the east At Jerusalem (Beit ?afafa) a small funerary chapel and mausoleum ewer excavated by the department of antiq uities under the direction of Mr. Y. Landau. The chapel, 7x8 m. in area, was paved with mosaic and had col umns with Corinthian capitals. A square niche in the western wall was inlaid with a mosaic inscription in four lines commemorating a certain Samuel and his family. The inscription is dated in the year 206 of an hitherto unknown (Con stantinian?) era of Jerusalem. The in scription goes 'backwards', i.e. it begins with the fourth line, and ends with the first. The mausoleum adjoining the chapel had a floor divided into eight compartments, which contained six lead coffins (including two children's coffins). The coffins were decorated with garlands, ropes and crosses. From June to October, 1953, the Metro politan Museum of Art, New York, housed an exhibition 'From the Land of the Bible', arranged by the Association of Israel Museums and the American fund for israel institutions, With the active assistance of the Department of Antiquities, the Ministry of Education and Culture and many public and private collections in Israel. Dr. P. Kahane of the Deparment of Antiquities was in charge of the exhibition. The exhibition was arranged in eight rooms, each devoted to a special subject, such as prehistory, the Canaanite Age, the Israelite period, the Hellenistic to Byzantine times, etc. Among the outstanding objects may be mentioned a representative set of ob jects and figurines related to the Yarmuk</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS 267 ian culture, some of the Execration texts (lent by the Brussels Museum), ivories from Megiddo, anthropomorphic coffins from Beth-Shan, the Tell Qas?le ostraca, some leaves from the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Tabernacle relief from Capernaum, the Samaritan mosaic inscription from the Shaalbim synagogue and the complete mosaic of the 'Sacrifice of Isaac' from Beth Alpha. The coin and seal sections (mainly from the Reifenberg collection) were of rare completeness. The monu mental porphyry statue from Caesarea, set up in the vestibule of the Museum, served as an introduction to the exhibi tion. A number of American museums generously lent material from their col lections and thus contributed to the com prehensive character of the exhibition. The israel numismatic society held its Third Convention on 26-27 June 1953 at Jerusalem {d.IEJ, 1,1950-51, p. 251; 2, 1952, p. 255). The meeting was devot ed to papers on ancient coins of Jerusa lem. The following papers were read : The Periods of Coinage in Jerusalem ( Y. Meshan), The Chronology of the Hasmonaean Coins in the Light of Palaeographical Research (A. Kindler), Were the Coins of the Roman Pro curators struck in Jerusalem? (M. Narkiss), The Coins of the First War against Rome (Prof. A. Reifenberg), The Coins of Aelia Capitolina (L. Kadman), Early Arab Coins from Jerusalem (U. Ben-Horin), The Coins of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (M. Narkiss). The Ninth Annual Archaeological Con vention of the israel exploration society, 'The Land of the Negev\ was held at Beersheba from 25-29 September 1953. A detailed report of the conference includ ing summaries of the papers read will appear in the next number of this Journal. Obituaries: Sir Charles F. Arden-Close, late Chairman of the Palestine Exploration Fund, died on 19 December 1952, at the age of 87 years. Sir Charles was a man of rare gifts : soldier and eminent cartogra pher, he combined the approach of the exact scientist with a broad humanist and philosophical outlook. He was Chief of the Geographical Section of the General Staff (1905-1911), and from 1911 to his retirement in 1922, Director-General of the Ordnance Survey. Archaeologists owe a special debt to Sir Charles for his appointment of an Archaeological Officer to the Ordnance Survey: O.G.S.Craw ford. Sir Charles was President of the Royal Geographical Society from 1927 to 1930. For many years he was one of the chief representatives of his country at the International Geographical Union, acting as Secretary-General, and from 1934 to 1938 as President. His major contribution to the work of the Union lay in the field of the International Map of the World, 1:1 Mill., with which he had been connected since his days at the GSGS.From 19 3 0 to 194 5 Sir Charles was Chairman of the Palestine Exploration Fund, in whose activities he had taken a keen interest for many years. He wrote a number of papers on subjects relating to this country, of which the one on Rain fall in Palestine and his last paper on the Cave of Machpelah (PEQ, 1951) may be mentioned.</page><page sequence="8">268 NOTES AND NEWS TheReverendDr HerbertDanby, Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford Uni versity, died in his sixty-fourth year. Prof Danby was born at Leeds, and was edu cated atKebleCoilege, Oxford, graduating in Oriental languages and theology (D. D. 1923). He entered Holy Orders in 1914, becoming curate at Hawarden in 1914 and Librarian at St George's in 1919. From 1921 to 1936 Rev. Danby was resident canon at St George's cathedral, Jerusalem. His task was, inter alia, that of keeping in touch with the Jewish com munity of the Holy City and Palestine in general. A distinguished scholar, equally proficient in Biblical and modern Hebrew, Prof. Danby was one of the founders of the Palestine Oriental Society, editor of the JPOS, 1920-1936, and President of the Society in 1934 He was also Dean of the Board of Higher Studies of the Department of Education set up by the Mandatory Government, from 1923 to 1936. During his stay in Jerusalem Prof. Danby produced the first complete and handy translation of the Misna into English; he also translated Prof. Klaus ner's Life of Jesus From Jerusalem Prof. Danby passed on to the chair of Hebrew at Oxford, where he continued to the day of his death Dr Paul Solomonic a, ( onsulting Geolo gist, was killed in a traffic accident on 21 September 195* He had studied at Vienna University under F E. Suess,where he received a thorough academic and field training. Having been connected for some years with the Geological Depart ment of the Hebrew University, Solomo nica took a leading part in the geological exploration of the Negev and the Dead Sea region. It was near the Dead Sea that by pure accident he missed death when G. S. Blake with whom he was working at the time was murdered by Arab ban dits in 1940. Solomonica was an excel lent field geologist, distinguished by his powers of endurance,and a keen and pains taking investigator in the fields of tectonic geology and stratigraphy. As he worked for various prospecting companies, most of his reports have not been published. Amongst his published writings mention should be made of the paper by L. Picard and Solomonica: On the Geology of the Gaza - Beersheba District, JPOS, 16, 1936,pp. 180-223, which was based on field-work by Solomonica. With his un timely death at the age of 45 Israel has lost one of its most serious and experi enced workers in the development of the country's mineral resources.</page></plain_text>
