ALKER School of International Relations, University of Southern California The Wealth of States: A Comparative Sociology of International Economic and Political Change. By John M. Hobson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. 338 pp., $54.95 cloth (ISBN: 0-521-58149-4), $18.95 paper (ISBN: 0-521-58862-6). One of the most revealing passages in The Wealth of States, John Hobson's impres- sively researched and argued book, attacks both Karl Marx and Kenneth Waltz. According to Hobson, commitments to general and parsimonious theory are "the greatest trap. Parsimonious theories have given rise to the most extreme and violent political movements" (p. 278). Creating anthropomorphic states (realism) and classes (Marxism) exaggerates these actors' importance, an error made worse by the false assumption that "international politics has a single essence (the state system in neorealism, the mode of production in Marxism)" (p. 276). Preferably, we should see the mode of production and the interstate system as important ele- ments of each other, not purely constituted, requiring the analysis of the "mutual interactions of states and classes, interstate systems and state-society relations ... [each possessing only] partial interactive autonomy" (p. 277). Citing Michael Mann and Norbert Elias, Hobson suggests that state actors are not "monolithic, self- constituting 'billiard balls."' Rather, they are promiscuous-intertwined and inter- woven with other power actors-creating the "interdependence of domestic and international space" (pp. 277, 272). Hobson's alternative "sociological theory may not be particularly elegant compared to realism, but perhaps it is more 'realistic"' (p. 278). Challenging the "prevailing assumption within IR . . . that Max Weber was a political realist" (p. 2), Hobson offers several important conceptual elaborations to spell out his argument. The first of these is Weber's multicausal, antireductionist treatment of state capacity as based, not merely on institutional factors, but also on "social power residing within society" (p. 2). Differing in some details from Peter Evans and his colleagues (1985) and from Mann (1986, 1993), Hobson nevertheless shares with them a nonrealist, non-zero-sum conception of a state's social power as exercised through a kind of "embedded autonomy" (Evans 1995) of bounded, insu- lated, cooperative relations with society. For example, the remarkable autonomy of the British state in the early twentieth century was linked to its success in playing off dominant and lower classes in ways that enabled both relatively heavy, yet consen- sual, direct income taxation before and during World War I and survival in the interstate system. Such capacities increase with the "depth" of social embeddedness and infrastructural-penetrative power. They decrease with the level of accumulated "despotic" or coercively extracted power. Finally, they are limited by federal and ter- ritorially decentralized domestic governance structures, as existed in Germany before and during World War I. Ten such propositions (pp. 251-252) lead to a refined, nine-component definition of the modern state (pp. 252-253) linking both social and institutional factors of an endogenous and external character.

Because they are too static and a prioristic, however, Hobson advocates discarding both sovereignty and interna- tional anarchy as central organizing principles of state behavior and international politics (pp. 272-273). Surely this is a "non-realist [and non-Marxist] theory of state power" (pp. 269ff)! The greatest strength of The Wealth of States is its neo-Weberian, fiscal- sociological revision of conventional accounts of changes in more or less protec- tionist trade regimes in imperial Germany, czarist Russia, and liberal Britain from 1870 to1913. Less detailed accounts, useful for comparative analytic purposes, are also given for the United States, Canada, Australia, and Switzerland during the same period. Together the four case chapters (chapters 2-5) make up more than half the book. Responses to geofiscal increases in military costs, threats of reces- sion, and international tensions affected states with weaker and stronger capacities differently. The stronger states were able to shift to direct taxation practices, which eventually supported war victories; the weaker states were eventually subject to defeat in war and social revolutions. (Summary accounts of these processes are nicely graphed on pp. 166-167, 191). Hegemonic stability theory, reductionistic class analyses, late development theory, along with Marxist and neorealist analyses more generally, are all seriously contradicted with often painstakingly constructed quantitative evidence, using this multidimensional account of social and institu- tional power relations. What is less satisfactory about Hobson's account is the dismissal of the realist and Marxist traditions of practically oriented, interpretive theorizing. The writings of Hedley Bull, Martin Wight, E.H. Carr, and Hans Morgenthau have more soci- ological and practical relevance than is recognized here. In ways that Hobson neglects, the "revolutionary-dialectical" Marxist approach distinguishes between essential-constitutive and historical-causal relations, as Hayden White among oth- ers has shown (White 1973; Alker 1996). Moreover, Hobson's dismissal of Gram- schian Marxism with the assertion that "non-reductionist Marxism is a nonsequitur" (p. 224) and of postmodern critical analyses because of "the nihilism of postmodernism" (p. 275) is much too apocalyptic (cf. Appadurai 1990 and White 1991 for more constructive alternative views). If these alternative believers in sociologically informed multidisciplinary studies do not have better theories of the state than Hobson offers, they nevertheless portray the multifaceted complex- ity of contemporary transnational-international relations as well as, or better than, Hobson, despite his impressive and well-grounded neo-Weberian account. After all, on open but crowded seas, we are all trying to repair one or another leaking vessel in a flotilla of ships variously named after the gods Community, Prosperity, Justice, and Order. All our individual ships are sailing into an unknown future without the benefit of their original engineering drawings, agreed-upon sig- naling codes, or exact navigational charts. We need all the help we can get. References ALKER, HAYWARD R. (1996) Can the End of Power Politics Be Part of the Concepts with Which Its Story Is Told?
