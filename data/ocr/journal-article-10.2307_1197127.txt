<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD J. M. POWIS SMITH University of Chicago HERE is today great uncertainty and indefiniteness about the idea of God. Our knowledge of the universe today is so much more comprehensive than was the knowledge of our ancestors that the ideas of God they based upon their limited range of information are by no means ade- quate to explain the universe as we know it. My purpose here is to sketch the growth of the idea of God among the Hebrews of the Old Testament period. When they entered Palestine they came in as nomads from the desert. Their God was a god of the nomads. They credited him with the ability to care for them as nomads, to fight their battles, and to protect their flocks and herds. They recognized their obligations to their fellow-clansmen, but toward nations alien to them they felt no responsibility. This state of mind was re- flected in their ideas of God. They kept Yahweh for themselves alone and regarded themselves as his chosen people. Other na- tions were under the control of other gods. There were as many gods as there were separate nations. One of the most convinc- ing proofs that the Hebrews shared this general Semitic view of the scope of the activity of their god is the statement made by David when fleeing from Saul and on the verge of crossing over into Philistine territory; chiding Saul for his hostility to- ward him, he says, "If Yahweh has stirred you up against me, let him be appeased by an offering; but if they be the sons of men, cursed be they before Yahweh, for they have driven me out today, so that I have no share in the inheritance of Yahweh, saying, 'Go serve other gods.' Now, therefore, may my blood not fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh, for the 24</page><page sequence="2">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 25 King of Israel has come forth to seek my life, as one hunts a partridge in the mountains." Note the expressions "Go serve other gods" and "away from the presence of Yahweh," both of which imply a spatial limitation of Yahweh's presence and power. It is significant that this episode belonged in the closing days of the reign of King Saul, that is to say somewhere around 1015 B.C. and after the Hebrews had been in Palestine at least two hundred years. It is noteworthy, too, that Yahweh is deemed capable of making trouble and of being bought off by a sacrifice. The entry into Palestine marked a great change in the He- brew idea of God. When the Hebrews entered Palestine they thought of Yahweh in terms of the nomadic life which they had been living for generations. In the J document Yahweh is represented as eating, talking face to face with men (Gen. 1:28-30), and the like. In the gar- den of Eden story Yahweh tells Adam personally that he may eat of the various trees in the garden, but that he may not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, lest he die (Gen. 2:17). Yahweh also performs a surgical operation upon Adam and makes Eve with his own hands (Gen. 2:22 f.). He also takes his daily walk in the garden in the cool of the evening (Gen. 3:8), and has to call for Adam in order to find him and talk to him (Gen. 3:9). He talks freely with Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:9-13) and the serpent (Gen. 3:14, 15). He turns tailor and makes skin tunics for Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:21). He creates man without any suspicion of the kind of life he is going to live and when he discovers what a sinful race humanity is he sends a flood upon the earth to wipe the race out of existence, with the exception of Noah and his family (Gen. 6: 5-8:1 7). When the flood has subsided and man offers a burnt offering to Yahweh upon the dry land, Yahweh smells the soothing odor of the sacrifice and is so pleased and grateful that he makes a promise that never again shall there be such a destruction of</page><page sequence="3">26 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION life as the flood involved (Gen. 8: 20-22). The human race, however, made such progress that Yahweh was afraid of what they might do, so he sent confusion into their speech and scat- tered them all over the face of the earth (Gen. II:I-9). When Abraham went down to Egypt and arranged with Sarah his wife that she should declare herself to be his sister in order that his own life might not be imperiled because of her beauty, the scheme worked well. But when Sarah was taken over into the Pharaoh's harem, "Yahweh struck Pharaoh and his household with severe diseases because of Abram's wife Sarah" (Gen. 12:10o-19). The unethical character of this situa- tion is manifest; Abram lies through his wife; the Pharoah in utter ignorance of the true situation takes Sarah for himself; then Yahweh, who presumably is regarded as knowing the real facts, sends severe diseases upon Pharaoh and his household. When Moses, with his wife and son, was on his way to Egypt to fulfil his commission, "at a camping-place in the course of the journey Yahweh encountered him, and tried to kill him. So Zipporah took a flint and cutting off her son's foreskin, she touched his (i.e., Moses') person with it, saying, 'You are my bridegroom in blood.' Then he let him alone" (Exod. 4:24-26). This is a most primitive story and embodies an extremely primi- tive idea of deity. These facts are proof enough of the limitation of J's conception of God. He is God of Israel and favors her at the expense of foreign peoples. He is thought of in the most highly anthropomorphic fashion. His morals are on a distinctly human plane and judged by present-day ideals are much below par. Passing over into the E document's traditions, which are generally supposed to be a half-century or so later than those of J, we may expect to find no great advance in the standards of E as compared with those of J. One marked difference between the two sources is in the fact that E does not permit Yahweh to appear unto men in physical form and to talk with them as he does right along in J. Yahweh's revelations in E are always</page><page sequence="4">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 27 communicated in the form of visions or dreams or through angels. But yet God is represented as tempting Abraham's loy- alty by ordering him to sacrifice his dearly-beloved Isaac upon an altar (Gen. 22:11-14). This story, of course, was told in order to impress upon the Jews, on the one hand, the idea that Yahweh did not in reality wish for human sacrifices and, on the other, the fact that Abraham's obedience to Yahweh was absolute and unquestioning. Yet another extraordinary story is told by E. Jacob wrestled with an unknown man all night, coming out of the struggle with his thigh out of joint; the "unknown man" turned out to be God himself. Therefore Jacob named the spot "Peniel" saying, "I have seen God face to face and yet my life has been spared" (Gen. 32: 25-30). It has been suggested that this episode originally involved an attack upon Jacob by a demon. It is true that in I Sam. 28:13, the word Vol?N, ordinarily used for God, denotes the spirit of the dead Samuel, but the whole spirit and language of the passage as it now stands, whatever may have been its original sense, clearly imply that God himself wrestled with Jacob. This is very simi- lar to the experience of Hagar as recorded in the J document (Gen. i6: 13 f.). After the theophany which she has undergone she says, "Have I really seen God and am still living after my vision?" This and Jacob's experience are in striking contrast with the attitude of Moses at Sinai, when Yahweh held an inter- view with Moses during which Moses did not dare to look into the face of Yahweh; so "he hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God" (Exod. 3:5). E's God was likewise subject to changing moods. When Yahweh commissioned Moses to return to Egypt and demand the release of the Jews from captivity, and Moses excused himself on the ground that he was no speaker, "the anger of Yahweh blazed against Moses" (Exod. 4:14). The low ethical plane upon which the story of the plagues in Egypt is laid is shared by both J and E. Several times in this experience the Pharaoh, in the midst of a plague, promises that he will let Israel go; but after Moses has stopped the plague and</page><page sequence="5">28 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION things have again become normal, Pharaoh changes his mind and refuses to keep his promise. This is all because Yahweh has hardened Pharaoh's heart (Exod. 7:3; 9:12, 35; 10:20, 27; ii:io; etc.). With like unfairness Yahweh is represented as having created a favorable and friendly attitude on the part of the Egyptians toward the Israelites on the eve of their de- parture from Egypt so that the Israelites were loaded with gifts by the Egyptians and carried these gifts off with them into the desert (Exod. 12:35 f.). This was equivalent to divinely ar- ranged theft. I have probably cited enough incidents already to demon- strate the low ethical level of the early Hebrew idea of God, to show its intensely anthropomorphic character, and to prove its strongly nationalistic and partisan nature. Let me now pass on to the first few centuries after they settled in Palestine, say, roughly speaking, from the fifteenth century B.c. to the twelfth century B.C. The settlement in Canaan was a gradual movement, lasting over a fairly long period. The first settlers are probably to be identified in part at least with the Habiri of the Tel-el-Amarna letters, who entered the north of Palestine somewhere in the fifteenth century; and the latest immigrants probably came in from the Negeb and settled down in the south at a later period. Both groups alike found themselves amid wholly new conditions upon their settlement in Canaan. Prior to their entrance they had lived a nomadic life, wandering about in the desert from one place to another and fighting with hostile groups of other nomads over the possession of wells and oases. The life of the nomad was simple in the highest degree. The groups were rela- tively small and were more like families than nations. Condi- tions in nomadic life were such as that only very small groups of people could live together. Consequently, the relationships between families and individuals were very close, and in some cases intimate. Thus the group life was ordered upon a rela- tively high scale, judged by the standards of the age in general.</page><page sequence="6">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 29 But the attitude of these small groups toward the outside non- Hebraic world was hostile and suspicious. With the entry into Palestine the whole order of life was changed. The people were no longer grouped in such small units. Palestine being the con- necting bridge between Asia and Africa, the Hebrews were brought into contact with a constant stream of travelers be- tween the two great areas. Thus they were in a continuous process of educational experience. Their world was enlarged beyond all their previous powers of imagination. This, of course, directly affected their idea of God. Now that they were in Palestine, they entered upon a new type of existence. They exchanged the nomad's life for the life of the farmer. They had known little or nothing of this type of life before entering Palestine, and now they had to begin a new kind of existence. They had to have teachers of the new way of living. The only source of instruction available to them was to be found among the Canaanites themselves. But the Canaan- ites could teach agriculture only by the way in which they them- selves practiced it; and with them the ideas of religion and the practice of agriculture were indissolubly bound together. They could not teach farming apart from their religious practices which were so closely associated with it. The dominant element in the religion of Canaan was the fertility cult which was a vital part of Baalism. The Hebrews, therefore, in learning from the Canaanites how to farm were brought face to face with Baalism in its most seductive form. At once there arose a con- flict between Yahwism and Baalism which continued for more than a couple of hundred years and left its mark upon Yahwism. This was the kind of conflict in which the prophets were engaged in the early centuries. Yahweh was in great danger of being ignored and forgotten, for he was not credited with any knowl- edge of agricultural life, having always been associated hereto- fore with nomadic life and customs. Now that his people had moved into a new kind of world and had to learn a new type of daily labor, they naturally were strongly inclined to seek the</page><page sequence="7">30 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION local gods who had long been associated with agricultural ac- tivities. The temptation to adopt this mode of religious pro- cedure was very strong, for the cultus of Baalism and the fertil- ity cult were very sensual and made a powerful appeal to the sensual appetites of the Hebrews. The prophets were the chief factor in saving Yahwism from extinction. Their continued ap- peal to their countrymen was to the effect that they must be loyal to Yahweh their own God, and refrain from indulging in the worship of other gods. Along with this they insisted upon the practice of social justice, an idea that they had brought in with them from the desert, but which found many new ways of application in the agricultural and commercial life of Canaan. The result of this long-drawn-out conflict in the realm of the idea of God was that finally Yahweh came to be credited with a great expansion of his powers. He gradually displaced Baalism and the fertility cult, and was regarded as the giver of crops and the God of the entire agricultural life with all its compli- cated and complex operations. Another element that entered into the growth of the God- idea in Israel was the location of the new home into which they had entered. Palestine was very strategically located. It lay on the highway of the nations. Practically all the traffic of the ancient world passed through Palestine. To the north and east of Palestine lay the territory of Babylonia and Assyria, Persia, the Hittites, Syria, Moab, and Ammon; and to the south of it lay Egypt and Ethiopia. Palestine was the bridge connecting these two great areas. Sometimes the leadership of the ancient world lay in the east or northeast; at other times it lay in the south. The armies of the rival powers marched back and forth across this connecting bridge and the international commerce of that era took the same route. The travel of that age was not by means of express trains or aeroplanes, but on foot, or on the backs of camels; and what now takes but a few hours, then re- quired days and weeks of time. Such traffic could not have passed continually over this bridge without exercising some</page><page sequence="8">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 31 educational influence upon the population dwelling thereon. It enlarged their knowledge of the scope and extent of the world in which they lived and it brought in conflicting ideas of God and of religion, from which they could not fail to learn some- thing. Another element that must have deeply affected their idea of God was the fact that in 933 B.C. the Northern Kingdom re- volted from Rehoboam and became a separate kingdom. But while Northern Israel rebelled against Rehoboam it remained loyal to Yahweh. There were now two separate kingdoms both serving the same god. Not only so, but much of the time they were at war one with the other and were calling upon the same god for help. This is a difficult situation even when the entire civilized world recognizes but one, only God; but when each nation has its own exclusive god and two of them select the same god as their patron, it is still more difficult and puzzling, if they become enemies and meet each other upon the field of battle. This was the situation in Israel and Judah for several generations. This must have influenced the development of the God-idea in Palestine very much indeed. If Yahweh could con- trol the affairs of two hostile nations why could he not be thought of as exercising authority over an indefinite number? As a matter of fact, the prophets long before the exile did think of Yahweh as using the great nations of that day, namely, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, and the Hittites, as his agents in punishing the Hebrews for their sins. Thus they were able to explain the defeats of Israel at the hands of their foes. These defeats were not evidences of the superior power of the pagan gods as compared with Yahweh, but were chastisements for sin inflicted upon Israel by order of Yahweh. This implies that Yahweh was looked upon as having power to do as he pleased with the kingdoms of the world, at least when the interests and welfare of his own chosen people were at stake. It was but a short step from this point of view to the convic- tion that Yahweh was the God of all nations and the only God.</page><page sequence="9">32 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION This step was taken when the Exile fell upon Judah. A consid- erable proportion of the Jewish population was transported to Babylonia. They continued to worship Yahweh there. This spatial spread of the area in which Yahweh was recognized as supreme made its contribution to Hebrew monotheism. The tragic circumstances of the fall of Jerusalem and the captivity and the return from exile also contributed greatly toward the monotheistic point of view. The old idea that Yahweh con- trolled the movements of the nations so far as they affected Israel still continued. This explained the Exile; and the suc- ceeding downfall of Babylonia at the hands of Cyrus of Persia and his generous attitude toward the Jews were looked upon as direct contributions of Yahweh to the welfare of the Jews. In connection with the movement of return to Judah we find the writer of Isaiah, chapters 40-55, frequently referring to Yahweh in such a way as to show that he thought of him as the only and omnipotent God. Witness these words from Isaiah, chapter 40, verses 12-17: Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, And ruled off the heavens with a span? Who has held the dust of the earth in a peck, And weighed the mountains with a balance, And the hills in scales? Who has directed the mind of the LORD, And instructed him as his counselor? With whom took he counsel for his enlightenment, And who taught him the right path? Who taught him true knowledge, And showed him the way of intelligence? Lo! the nations are like a drop from a bucket, Like fine dust in the scales are they counted. Lo! the coast-lands weigh no more than a grain; And Lebanon is not enough as fuel for sacrifice, Nor are its beasts enough for burnt-offering. All the nations are as nothing before him, Blank ciphers he counts them.</page><page sequence="10">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 33 Let us add to this one more passage, namely Isaiah 41:1-4: Listen to me in silence, you coast-lands, And let the nations await my argument; Then let them approach, then let them speak, And together let us draw near for judgment! Who has roused one from the east, Whom victory meets at every step- Giving up nations before him, And bringing down kings? His sword makes them like dust, Like driven stubble his bow; He pursues them, and passes on safely, By paths his feet have not trodden. Who has wrought and done this? He who called the generations of men from the beginning- I, the LORD, who am the first, And am also with the last. Alongside of this sort of thing we may place the passages in the Book of Isaiah in which idolatry is ridiculed and denounced, namely, Isaiah 40:18, 19; 41:6, 7; 40:20; 41:21-24; and 43:8- 13- From this point on the development of the idea of God fol- lowed different lines. It was no longer a question as to the scope or extent of Yahweh's powers, but rather as to the character and quality of his deeds. It had long been a deep-rooted con- viction that prosperity was God's reward to the pious and that adversity was his punishment of the wicked. How easy and simple it would be if we could always determine a man's char- acter by the size of his salary or the amount of his credit at the bank! This conception was not uprooted easily. Indeed, the average man interested in piety seems still to think that there is some vital connection between prosperity and piety. But in the post-Exilic age the problem was acute in Israel. The history of Judaism did not support the doctrine; for though Israel may have fallen short of the divine ideal, yet those who triumphed over her were nations that fell far below Israel in their spiritual and ethical attainments.</page><page sequence="11">34 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION This was a problem that was very keenly realized by the Jews. It is first treated by the author of Deutero-Isaiah, name- ly, Isaiah, chapters 40-55. He discusses it in his poems on the Servant of Yahweh, that is, Isaiah 42: 1-4; 49: i-6; 50: 4-9; and 52:13-53: I2. The solution of the problem which he presents is a solution of the problem of suffering that has found much ap- proval in the Christian church at various periods; but is not so popular today as it once was. He makes the Servant represen- tative of the people of Israel as a whole and through him explains the long history of Israel's sufferings as due to their vicarious nature. Israel, according to him, has been suffering not for its own sins, but to expiate the sins of the nations; and in return for this service to mankind Israel shall in due time receive her full reward in the way of political and economic prosperity and power. That one of the prophets who had laid such stress as the school of the prophets had upon the quality of justice in God's administration of the world should represent Yahweh as treating Israel in such an unjust way is very strange indeed. That the theory of vicarious suffering did not find gen- eral approval among Jewish thinkers is quite evident, for so far as I know no Jewish writer followed up this line of thought. The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah is unique in Jewish literature. Christian theologians have interpreted it as foretelling the suffer- ings of Jesus and on the basis of it have formulated the theory of Christ's vicarious suffering for the sins of all mankind. The exegetical basis of this theory is all wrong, and the ethical basis of it reflects very unfavorably upon the moral ideas of God himself. A second attempt to seek an explanation of the problem of suffering is presented in that great masterpiece of Hebrew lit- erature, the Book of Job. Here the problem is presented in its individualistic aspect, and not as a nationalistic problem as in Deutero-Isaiah, but as a universal problem affecting mankind in general. The hero of the story, Job himself, is placed in the land of Uz, a region which nobody thus far has been able to</page><page sequence="12">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 35 locate. Furthermore, there is nothing about Job's personality or his line of thought that definitely marks him as a Jew. He might belong to any nationality. His problem, therefore, though a personal one, might belong to any individual the world around. It is the world-wide problem of personal suffering. The underlying cause of it is presented in the prologue to the Book of Job. It is.all due to the Satan, who doubts the sincerity of Job's devotion to Yahweh and seeks to demonstrate to Yahweh the fact that Job's religion will not bear the strain of intense suffering. Yahweh gives the Satan permission to go the limit in persecuting Job, but to stop short of taking Job's life. All this is unknown to Job, and when one misfortune after an- other has befallen him he finally breaks out in a protest against the fact that he ever came to birth. Then three of his old friends from various parts of the oriental world come to console him. These friends represent the various traditional attitudes toward the fact of suffering. The argument is presented in a series of three cycles, making a total of eighteen speeches in all. In each of the three cycles the three friends each make a speech and Job replies to each one of them in turn. It is out of the question to follow the course of the debate in detail here. We must be satisfied to summarize the result of the debate. The traditional viewpoint presented by the friends is shattered to atoms by the facts presented by Job; and the thing is carried so far by Job that the justice of God is called in ques- tion. But Job has no solution of the problem to present; he can but express his dissatisfaction with all the existing theories. Yet notwithstanding all this obscurity Job still holds fast to his belief in God. The debate is brought to an end by an address from God himself to Job. In this address the omnipotence and omnis- cience of God are presented so effectively that Job is over- whelmed and expresses his regret that he has been discussing a problem far beyond his range of understanding. The outcome of the Book of Job's contribution to the problem of suffering is</page><page sequence="13">36 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION therefore purely negative. It demonstrates that the traditional theory that piety brings prosperity is not in accord with facts, but it has no new theory to put in its place. It is an insoluble problem and we must be content to leave it in the hands of God, who is inconceivably great and wise beyond all possibility of our comprehension. The latest bit of literature in the Old Testament that in any way reflects a change in the idea of God is the Book of Ecclesi- astes. This was probably written about 200 B.C., just before the Maccabaean uprising. It is a composite work, representing the product of at least three minds. One of these belonged to a Pharisaic sort of person who sought to counteract the effect of the original writer by adding here and there throughout the treatise passages of a traditional and dogmatic character, in direct conflict with the thought of the original document. The second type of material added to the original treatise was the work of a traditional sage or wise man to whom most of the proverb-like utterances in the book must be assigned. The origi- nal author was a free thinker who had evidently been led by the course of circumstances to call in question most of the ac- cepted theological and ethical doctrines of his time. He had evidently read widely in Greek philosophy and had been strong- ly influenced thereby. Koheleth, as this unknown writer is called, still held on firmly to his belief in God. He regards God as the creator of the uni- verse and all that is therein. But, regarding the efforts of man- kind in general, he is a pessimist of the pessimists. There is nothing worth while under the sun. He reviews the various activities to which men give themselves and in each case his conclusion is the same: Futility of futility, says Koheleth, Futility of futilities, all is futility! This is the opening sentence of his treatise and it strikes the keynote of the whole work. The words "futile" and "futility" are used by Koheleth a total of seventy-four times. He not only</page><page sequence="14">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 37 begins his work with the comprehensive but appalling phrase "Futility of futilities, all is futility," but he closes it with pre- cisely the same words. Apparently he never stopped to think how this conclusion, if true, would affect his idea of God. That an all-wise God should have created this marvelous world and have put it into the hands of a people whose toil is futile and of no avail is unthinkable. It is rather to be concluded that the inanimate world being so wonderful, the animate beings who are given their home thereon must be even more so, and a survey of the progress of civilization would seem to sustain that conclusion. But Koheleth is convinced of the correctness of his conclu- sion; and his resultant counsel to the sons of men is to that effect. "There is nothing good for a man but that he eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too have I seen, that it is from the hand of God. For who can eat and who can enjoy apart from him?" (2:24 f.). And again, "If any man eats and drinks and enjoys himself in all his work, it is a gift from God" (3:13). And still again, "So, the good which I see to be worth while is that one should eat and drink and get enjoyment out of all his toil at which he toils under the sun during the course of his life which God grants to him; for that is his por- tion" (5: 17). To us practical Americans it may seem strange that a man should be expected to get joy out of his work after being told over and over again that nothing that he may do has any value. "For what does a man get for all his toil and the striving of his mind wherewith he has toiled under the sun? For all his days are sorrowful and his task is full of trouble, and at night his mind finds no rest. This too is futility" (2:22 f.). And regard- ing the labors of scholars Koheleth formulates the conclusion (Eccles. 1:18) that More wisdom is more worry And increase of knowledge is increase of sorrow.</page><page sequence="15">38 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION This pessimistic note apparently was not well received by Judaism as a whole; at least it is not followed up by any similar writing in the Biblical period. It is noteworthy that relatively little progress in the growth of the idea of God was made by the Jews in the post-Exilic period. The great advance step in out- lining the idea was taken at the time of the Exile as we have already seen, and after the Exile subordinate problems occupied Jewish attention. Of course, the more Judaism saw of the world at large and the more contacts the Jews had with other nations, the more would they unconsciously read into their idea of God, making it more comprehensive and detailed as the generations passed. But the individual steps of that process are not record- ed in historical records. The history of the Hebrew idea of God is a continuous series of adjustments and readjustments to the changing historical sit- uation in which the Jews found themselves. They recognized facts and constantly enlarged their theological views to fit the facts. This is exactly what religion is in need of doing in this present age. We have seen a wonderful transformation of our world-view in the last half-century. The scientific mind has been responsible for this. The supernatural has been compelled to yield its place to the natural. The telescope has enlarged our range of vision; the scientific man's photographs of distant stars and galaxies of stars have opened up new worlds to us and en- larged the universe almost inconceivably. Michelson has told us the exact rate of the speed of light, that is, 186,284 miles per second. The astronomer now talks in terms of light-hours, yea, even light-years. The light-hour represents a distance of 670,622,400 miles. What distance a beam of light would travel in a year I must leave to the mathematicians. The microscope of the physicists and the chemists has given us a new insight into the nature and structure of matter. The atom has given place to the molecule and the molecule to the electron; and these electrons circle around a center just as regularly as the earth encircles the sun.</page><page sequence="16">GROWTH OF THE HEBREW IDEA OF GOD 39 In a universe so vast and so methodically constructed there must be a directing and controlling Intelligence. It is incon- ceivable that so vast and so complex a machine should have come into existence and should have continued to operate throughout the centuries apart from some guiding intelligent force. The universe is not a mere thing of chance or the result of an accident. There is intelligence either within it or without it, and that Intelligence we call God. If the law of cause and effect holds good throughout the moral and spiritual world even as it does throughout the physi- cal universe then this controlling Intelligence is of ethical char- acter. Otherwise, the ethical ideals of mankind would be in- explicable. But the future only will reveal to man what the divine In- telligence really is. We can at present only guess at it. We have been at least eight thousand years, and probably longer, in arriving at our present stage of knowledge. Hence we have no right to think that we know as yet all that is to be known or that the remaining elements of knowledge at present hidden will be revealed to us overnight. It is more likely that we shall go on for centuries yet to come, ever increasing our knowledge and ever gaining a clearer understanding of God, who Is nearer to us than breathing Closer than hands and feet.</page></plain_text>
