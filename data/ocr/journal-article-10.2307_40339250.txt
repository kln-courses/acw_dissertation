<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unheard Writing in the Climate of Spectacular Noise: Claudia Rankine on TV Kevin Bell ABSTRACT This essay investigates the modes of style and methodology by which Claudia Rankine's 2004 multi-genre text Don t Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric animates concrete intertwinements between headline news and innovative literature; between hyper-capitalist marketing strategies and the incommunicability of physical and psychic suffer- ing; between language s insubstantiality and the ever-intensifying Lyotardian demand for "new idioms" of political/aesthetic expressiv- ity, sounded not only by the contemporary forms of social abjection and destitution thematized in the text - but by the experimental forms of its own presentation. Concentrating heavily on the self-ef- facing tonalities of the text, this essay traces the philosophic and tropic insistences structuring its implicit critique of the ideological position of critique itself. s ^^^eparated not by numerical or linguistic markers that would remove doubt - but instead by random, single pages that are left almost entirely blank and which therefore induce it - the acidically meditative sections of poet Clau- dia Rankine s multi-genre 2004 text, Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric, are always preceded by an isolated, un-explained image found at the bottom of each of these otherwise white pages. This lone insert is the invari- able black-and-white photograph of a television set, whose screen displays the random black-and-white dot pattern generally referred to as television "snow." This kind of snow is the visual expression of electronic noise, resulting from a weak or low signal, superimposed on the picture during poor analog or VHS tape reception. Described by the National Association of Broadcasters as "un- wanted" and "undesirable," the spectatorial experience of this kind of visual Vol. 3:1 93</page><page sequence="2">noise usually results in a change of channel or in the shutting off of the ma- chine altogether. Re-projected poetically, however, as a ruptural mechanism - one that brings to the foreground the spectatorial craving for solidity, continuity and clarity that it derails - the intermittent framing and presentation of this image of communicative dysfunction not only announces a mute, optic interval be- tween sections of Rankine's intricately spare prose (itself interlaced with yet other still images of and from television); but it re-opens an inescapable double paradox in the thinking of aesthetic experience and its social embeddedness. It goes to work on Theodor Adorno's question in Aesthetic Theory of art s neces- sary ignition upon the social reality from which it just as necessarily departs; but at the same time, it forces consideration of the reflective insistence silently structuring the material dimension ofthefigural. It demonstrates how such insis- tence sustains itself within the artwork's fabric by necessarily ingesting - but expelling differently and intrusively - the discursive idioms and logics it seeks to unravel, simultaneously reflecting and obliterating them in the moment of an unprecedented articulation. This particular scene of reading and rupture emerges from within an end- less broadcast of tedium that carries the familiar echo of another, more ancient and elemental droning. What Avital Ronell thinks of as a "primal buzz" or a kind of "originary interference" that constantly disrupts the projects, relations and formations that take shape within it, is not at all distant from the sound of what Ralph Ellison imagined a chaos at the very foundation of the social - the originary "Bad Air" of dissonant, jumbled sounds, shapes, intensities, energies and illusions produced by illusions - within or against which, the forces of insurgent thought and experimentation attempt to differentiate their own fluid contour and shape. Something like a Nietzschean/Paterian swarm o)f impressions, sensations and uncertitudes at the foundation of subjectivity's ceaseless becoming - a swarm of unorganized, potentially inscriptive material that is today displaced, or more precisely, co-opted and re-constituted by a motivated, predatory surround-sound engineering of global profit machin- ery - itself a matrix of ever-improving and ever more enveloping technicities. Rankine's writing seldom leaves the localized scene of this ongoing inter- penetration - the damaged or dead body. It meditates on the poverty of that body's circumstances and possibilities; and further still on the inability of lan- guage to secure within its own unfolding the substance of that poverty's densi- ties and textures. And yet, by the very movement of this meditation, its discontinuities and intervals in image/text historicize the inconsistent and self- contradictory character of entire ranges of American decisiveness and author- ity that are never far from the social destitutions over which they preside;pre-adolescent suicide; the toxic side effects of pharmaceutical treat- ments of liver failure and depression; the psychic and physical afterlives of 94 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="3">victims of police brutality; the questions posed by insurance adjusters to par- ents of recently killed children; the last weeks of shared communicability be- tween an Alzheimer's patient and his friends. All are situated thematically against an invisibly invasive cultural systematizing of descriptive de-singular- ization, which is to say that such catastrophes, as read by Rankine's writing, are typified by their fragmentation either into small news stories or constituent elements of medical, juridical or political administrative policy, illustrated al- ways by televisual flattening, or by graphs and charts. All of these techniques convert the inexpressibility of incommunicable experience into digestible quantities and referents, repackaged for mass re-circulation. But in its separation of such catastrophe from the vaporizing of its singu- larity that is its media "reporting" or institutional "accounting," the intrinsic unfolding of Rankine's image-text does more than disinter our cultural inca- pacity for engaging such radical dispossession differently. It returns us over and again to the idea that the project of description begins precisely at the point of its impossibility - that what lingers, for example, in the crabbed, chalkboard scrawl of the friend with Alzheimer's might exceed the content of his message- THIS IS THE MOST MISERABLE IN MY LIFE- and inhere instead, in the jagged multi-directionality of the scrawl-ing itself. A movement of writing that undoes its position in the moment it attempts to fix it, giving itself over completely to the idea and to the need of another's capacity for recognizing what is irreducible in the incommensurability of its expression. Sedimented within the impossibility of transposing for another the lived scope of his present impossibilities is an unspeakable urgency binding his private gesture to the provisional receptivity of a broader sensibility - at the level of a readership whose local empathy is cut or infused by something that demands to be read also as sharply political. In quite another scene from the text, the resonance of which is palpable here, Rankine cites a well-known instance from Levinas' work on this question: "The subject who speaks is situated in relation to the other. This privilege of the other ceases to be incomprehensible once we admit that the first fact of existence is neither being in itself nor being for itself but being for the other ... By offering a word, the subject putting himself forward lays himself open and in a sense, prays." The old man's scrawl is the laying bare of both the condition of abandonment and a word of direct address implicating those not yet so abandoned. This sense of implicated-ness is only one cost included in the economy of interpretation. BETWEEN DEATHS The mutual bindings, or dialectical implications of such "laying bare" recur in- frequently throughout Rankine s text, connecting the strangeness of isolated scenes from current news headlines with historical, literary or philosophical pre- Unheard Writing in the Climate of Spectacular Noise / Kevin Bell Vol. 3:1 95</page><page sequence="4">cursors, extending forward and back in time, inward and outward, from the seemingly familiar to the evidently unthought in the spaces of language and politics. This example is from page 84 of the text. In college, when I studied Hegel, I was struck by his explanation of the use of death by the state. Hegel argued that death is used as a threat to keep citizens in line. The minute you stop fearing death you are no longer controlled by governments and councils. In a sense you are no longer ac- countable to life. The relationships embedded between the "F and the "we" unhinge and lose all sense of responsibility. That "you," functioning as other, now exists beyond our notions of civil and social space. So terrorists embody that state of beyond; they are that freedom embod- ied. They bring life to that deathly state of lawlessness, breath to breath- lessness. They carry those whose lives they touch over into that breathless realm. Antigone, the character not the play, by Theban definition was a domestic terrorist. Hegel uses her as an example. She identified with the dead, was willing to walk among them. In the course of the drama, even though she has many lines left to speak in the play, Creon eloquently describes her to her sister as already dead. So it is, already, with Osama. One mode of living death - the suicidal decisiveness that characterizes the prac- tice of radical terrorism - opens war upon another - the tenacious passivity by which one learns to crave and secure a spot within the range of cultural designa- tions and dispositions administered and enforced by the social logic of interpel- lation. Shrouded in a death whose only code is the absolute and endless smashing of every code that has organized its previous "life," the Hegelian terrorist can be said to suspend its own meaning in the moment (s)he achieves it - and in the obliteration of its birthplace, to enter a zone defined not by any replacement spectrum of revolutionary ideals or structures of power - but instead by the per- petual suspension of the very notions of known code and ideal. In certain ways, Lonely presents a figural analogue to the militaristic func- tion of the terrorist it theorizes in the quoted passages. It frequently restages the scene of hopeless internal sickness and the inability of the suffering body to articulate not only the experience of its untranslatability, its radical alone- ness, its terrible singularity; but the extent to which one is made sick by its continual subjection to the kinds of material emptiness typified by the static noise described at the beginning of this piece - that are so incessantly placed before us as necessary. The text's laying bare of the unrelenting institutional and interpersonal inequities that are the essential accompaniment of physical pain and illness demonstrates not only the inherently political nature of Rank- ines literary and imagistic experiments; it re-animates the paradoxical inter- 96 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="5">stice central to her art, between the zone of cultural destitution and the spheres of poetic and philosophic discovery. Such writing, in its assiduous withdrawal from the logics of disclosure, assertion and position, deconstructs the matrix of cultural regimens and iden- tifications by which our familial, spiritual, educational and juridical engage- ments are ordered - and in so doing, exposes the insubstantiality of the broader narratives presumed to undergird them, such as "innocence/' "guilt" "responsibility" and "communication." The terrorist, who reinscribes his ex- pulsion from the atmosphere of his own formation by returning to it the death he believes it fed him, might be likened to the diseased and painful liver whose symptoms, treatments and medications Rankine illustrates so often in her text. It is the organ most responsible for converting so much of what we ingest into life sustaining material - and which is so frequently overwhelmed by the multiform toxins to which we so continually expose it. For Rankine, the body is a site on which different levels of muted critique play out at all times - but always according to another orientation of politics that eludes simple codifica- tions. By way of example, here's an abbreviated three-paragraph entry from Rankine's text: In the night I watch television to help me fall asleep, or I watch television because I cannot sleep. My husband sleeps through my sleeplessness and the noise of the television. Eventually is all a blur. I never remember turning the TV off, but always when I wake up in the morning, it is off. Perhaps he turns it off. I don't know. Some nights I count the commercials for antidepressants. If the same commercial is repeated I still count it. It seems right that pharmaceutical companies should advertise in the middle of the night, when people are less distracted and capable of tuning in more and more and most pre- cisely to their fearful bodies and their accompanying anxieties. One commercial, for PAXIL (paroxetine HCI) says simply, YOUR LIFE IS WAITING . . . Across the screen, later, this time minus audio, flashes: YOURLIFEISWAITING It remains on the screen long enough so that when I close my eyes to check if I am sleeping, instead of darkness, YOUR LIFE IS WAITING stares back at me. While the commercial/subjective "blur," or helpless in-text-uation of Rankine s narrator by the advertisement is finally made the mildly ironic object of this particular writing, such intextuation being made to function as a kind of punch line cannot be said in any way to reverse or even bring an endpoint either to commercial ideology's invasive procedures or to our inexhaustible capacity to Unheard Writing in the Climate of Spectacular Noise / Kevin Bell Vol. 3:1 97</page><page sequence="6">absorb them. The somnambulent tonality of the writing carries with it the weary edginess of the sleep-deprived - but beyond this tendency, the writing asserts no fixed particularity of stance and its drifting reportage issues from no determinedly oppositional point of evaluation or origin. The blaring whiteness of the letters spelling YOUR LIFE IS WAITING illusorily inscribed on the narrator's eyelids prints the ongoing consumability of her existence on its in- side - the injunction to buy the product is now more than simple salesman- ship - it is written in the body. Therefore, the inscription is just as clearly an effacement; and as the entire text does so frequently, this scene thematizes language s necessary liquidation of its own objects and assertions, thereby leav- ing its speaking or writing subject in abeyance. This particular scene exposes the "position" of narration as both "inside" and "outside" at once, since it no longer points toward the scene of cultural intextuation/subjective effacement as if able to do so from a distance or another position located elsewhere. The words that appear on the narrator's television screen, and which re-surface inside the lids of her closed eyes, are the living fabric of a spectacular haunting in which we cannot help but be disturbed by our very awareness of the completeness with which our thoughts, anxieties and desires have been created almost entirely by what we have absorbed passively. Part of what is arrested in the frozenness of the photographic TV image is the falsity of its intelligibility - or rather the falsity of this intelligibility's self-evident immediacy. The intensity and elongation of our looking into this televised image of words enacts a pivotal transfiguration of spectatorial passivity - and in the same moment, it neutralizes the movements of directly responsive action. Our looking resists, even ridicules the narratorial directives by which the presenta- tion of information would subordinate the desire driving this look - such looking is inseparable from a certain critical perspective or way of reflecting upon one's own circumstances; a perspective itself intensified in the text by its inseparability from the narrator's experience of an inexplicable dispossession of her own body; and a frustration resulting not only from that loss but from that inexplicability. But the audacity of the presentation of YOUR LIFE IS WAITING in turn resists and ridicules the audacity of an audience that thinks. It converts the loss of control over one's body into a direct and authori- tative narrative of responsibility, as well as one of "agency;" of blame as well as action. You have placed a brake on your own life and happiness. Why don't you remove it now? The force of the reflectivity opened by bodily anxiety is displaced in the commercial narrative by its restoration of "the subject" (the good and responsible one versus the bad and lazy or wallowing one) to the center of a real existence - one from which his body has already expelled, and exposed as empty precisely that possessive/identitarian notion of agency. The sleepy passivity of the narrator's voice measures not only the formal seductive/ shaming power deployed so effectively by commercial enterprise, but also re- 98 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="7">fleets the futuristic, "blank slate" mode of alterity that alone constitutes what- ever we might actually mean by "subjectivity." This passivity re-projects, as it records, the commercial reduction of physical suffering and the complexities it generates to the anthropomorphic inertia of a "story." What the text suspends, crucially, is the movement of intentionality that presumptively characterizes the standard practice of critique. For such point- edly firm intentionality or solidity of stance would submerge and conceal the very realities of anxiety and disorientation that make the narrator available prey to the advertisements seductiveness. Her language of affects implies no single discernible habit or trajectory of thought or any stable reality but only articulates its own voicing - just as the inserted photograph of the advertise- ment's white text on the black screen can be said to have never articulated any specific idea, but only the ubiquitous form or frame of representation itself. What else might Werner Hamacher mean when he writes that "the language of pathos, of anxiety, is at bottom, a language of disillusionment about the referential capacity of language?" (193) Where Rankine and Hamacher meet is in the realization that language, as the organizing field of social reality, is motivated beyond measure by the reality of interminable anxiety, constituted entirely by promises that cannot be fulfilled - by a term's inability to material- ize what it re-presents. Her work, like Ralph Ellison's beforehand, explores the unseen reception of the non-stop drone of non-information - projected in her case, byway of televised noise - and investigates how it retains its hypnotic power precisely because of its status as an endless promise of actual value, meaning and attractively contoured identity. The intolerable un-decidability of what is commercial "text" outside the body and what is "pure," or "real" desire or life force "inside" is a pre-condition of the narrator's sleepwalk into the product's purchase. This un-decidability will be exploited by and within uncomplicated market discourses whose projection or pre-installation of such "needs" or anx- ieties - and whose pre-accounting of their resolutions - is now technologically embodied in the form of a pill that will alleviate one mode of suffering while acknowledging in advance that its ingestion will at the same time create new ones, some of such severity they themselves will require even newer remedies carrying hosts of entirely other "side" effects, each of which awaits its turn at the center of bodily dissatisfaction and pain. At stake in Rankine's text is not so much an antagonistic organization and deployment of "oppositional" tactics of guerilla art, but rather the experimen- tal presentation of an alternate critical atmosphere in which the material priva- tion of its formal gestures and procedures - a literary/visual surface arranged primarily by its self-estrangements and gaps - all reflect the social impover- ishment of its object - the cultural language of hyper-reification and its one- dimensional flattening of experience into stupefied spectatorship of itself. A language which at all hazards presents itself as a unitary, unbroken membrane Unheard Writing in the Climate of Spectacular Noise / Kevin Bell Vol. 3:1 99</page><page sequence="8">of ever-elasticizing self-cohesion, volume and impermeability. Lonely stages a theatre of continuous collapse and negative regeneration in which thematic insistences of incomprehension, failure and loss intersect, at every new compo- sition, with exposure to creative, which is to say, critical imagistic and aural vocabularies for such zones of experience - vocabularies heretofore either de- preciated, submerged or disappeared by more dominant techniques of politics, art and socio-commercial exchange. Such a text suggests a somberly futuristic " detournement? in which individual pictures, news "sound bites," advertise- ments and other modes of cultural re-presentation are broken out and isolated from the incessant showering or bombardment of marketed imagery and non- information they help constitute; and then re-situated in distant social con- texts. Here they are slowed to a more manageable speed, indeed even frozen, so as to induce reflection upon the unseen, unheard, unthought dimensions of damage and disfigurement they have already wrought in their aggregate per- meation of every possible sphere of individuated life and thinking. Such a project as this can't really be reduced however, either to the playful attitudes of scandalous defacement and gamesmanship or to the more "re- demptive" logics of social transformability usually implied by Debord's term. This is because the internal rhythms of Rankine's compositions of image/text can't really be read - at least not outside of their own internal logics of inges- tion and exhalation. Which is to say that they can't be read outside the logic of their own silences; that the realities they bear would only be mutilated by the wishful transparency of their naming or designation. The text can't be read outside of a faith that such withdrawal as it performs throughout its length can register - as do the unannounced rests and interruptions of experimental mu- sics - as a reflective break from the illogical mandate of im-mediate meaning within the hypermediated social context it takes as its primary object of attack. Rankine's formal gestures, like that of the dying old man's jagged scrawl, de- mand to be understood in the absence of any expectation that they actually can be. These gestures give themselves over to the impossibility of being read - doing so in the furor of an insurrectionary faith that outside the precincts of authority and action - a few of whose social effects they chronicle - they open another order of thinking's legibility and reverberation. Don t Let Me Be Lonely is a critically improvisatory meditation on the tex- tures of living death. By this I mean to connote not only questions of physical dying or of the kinds of cultural zombification that thinkers from Adorno or Debord to Amiri Baraka evoke in their own assessments of hyper-mediated, inertia-saturated life. I mean to try to open something near what Rankine's narrator touches when she writes of her sister, who is "being made to perform a life I don't want to live"(77). I would like to draw attention to the reflective means by which Rankine's language - its sounds of hesitation and aporia - enacts a radical attunement to the effects of its own daily evisceration; to the 100 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="9">seemingly inexorable conversion of its (and our) procedures of listening and thinking into commodity-things. And in that way I want to draw attention to the un-anticipated effects by which her language opens something close to what Nathaniel Mackey touches when he writes in Bedouin Hornbook of what it might mean for "the airiness of every previous disposition" to now make it- self felt - for the subsequent weightlessness of decisions that once seemed "heavy" to surface again in the moment of creative pivot or crisis (110). The critical angle of Rankine s work is improvisatory in the sense that its resis- tances to or disengagements from such conversion/reification as Adorno, Debord or Baraka have theorized differently are articulated to perhaps stron- gest effect in the singularities of their subtonality; in their contradictions and self-suspensions; in their reticence and silence. For such nuances carry not only unarticulated historical reverberations; they constitute the surface - which is to say the substance - of the "new," explorative idioms of communication Jean- Francois Lyotard called for in the 1980s. Such idioms are simultaneously fu- turistic and ancient, in the sense that they are submerged and perhaps inaudible to those for whom its Afro-Diasporic interlocutors, such as Claudia Rankine today, have always constituted an invisible or, more precisely, discarded field of thought in the Western world. The conventionally passive unfolding of semantic development is radically displaced in Lonely by an interpretive working-through of textual and imagis- tic co-presences (corn-positions) that augment and cut each other, and in so doing, liquefy any tendency to caption, explain or stabilize each other. Such intercutting opens us up to the aporetic silence of interrogative force at work within the text's figurally experimental investigation, centering less on the un- interrupted 24-hour drone of consumerist noise than on its hidden or denied effects and consequences. The relentless self-suspension that unmoors Rank- ine s writing from the fixity of an"oppositional" stance proceeds less from the text s thematization of its own status as nothing more than another product of that totality, less from its own inability to detach itself from the scene of its own birth, education and continued situated-ness within that hyper-mediated framework than it does from the reality that for her, as for Blanchot, "to write is to break the bond that unites the word with myself" (26). In the energy of sound, image and intensity created by its own "scrawl-ing," writing disengages from the administrative/identifying function of ordinary language. And it is exactly in the disjunct opened by its own quietude that this text identifies and eviscerates from within the regulative nature of both the metastasized sur- round-sound of the interconnected networks of droning, buzzing non-infor- mation that produced it (and us), and its (and our) own complexes of simultaneous investments therein; investments compromised and even mo- mentarily undone, however momentarily, by the tonal particularities that sub- Unheard Writing in the Climate of Spectacular Noise / Kevin Bell Vol. 3:1 101</page><page sequence="10">stantiate our own everyday flights from those networks, in the surfaces of our own presentation of our thinking to the world. Rankine's text subjects itself formally to the congenital default and dis- possession that it thematizes as first principles of material survival within the atmosphere of commercially/officially administered noise with which we are supposed to identify at all times. The most prominent example of this dynamic is her book's structural juxtaposing of the detached photographic images of televised static I described at the beginning of this paper with dozens of other photographs of televised news and "reality" that are inserted directly into other pages of her written text, disorienting any topological understanding of inside and outside, of singularity and totality. The isolated character of the televised static's non-intelligibility at the bottom of its otherwise empty page intensifies our subsequent sense of physical connectedness with the faces, bodies, places and objects shown on the television screens cutting into the text of the pages that follow; pages featuring frozen pictures of televised "events," or what Debord identified as "society's broadcast to itself of its own image of its own history, a history reduced to a superficial and static pageant of its rulers - the persons who embody the apparent inevitability of whatever happens" (33). It is only later, from one kind of oppositional perspective, that the momentary quality of this illusory relation makes itself felt; only later that whatever "oce- anic" sense of implicated-ness on the part of the spectator in the "pageant" s/ he has just seen fragmented across Rankine's pages, begins to reveal itself as a fusion of that spectator's own construction. From this perspective, there is no collectivity, no partnership, but only the administration and projection of "life" on camera that the spectator passively (mis)takes for his or her own - thereby sealing itself tightly within an externally programmed fantasy of agency that is in truth its zombified negative. But a different mode of oppositionality - actually something like a criti- cal dfe-positionality or what, in his later writings, Lyotard identified so pro- vocatively as drift - might allow for a deeper exploration of the necessary mutings and mutilations, mutations and mutualities animated by the inter- connection of Rankine's writing and the images cutting that writing. From the angular perspective of such drift, this mirage of identification with ele- ments of spectacular pageantry is less likely to have resulted from exposure to the multiply disembodied images of media and political celebrities and events pictured within the text - a kind of static that presents itself as activity, vi- brancy and power - than to have been stirred by the presumptive opposite of those images; by the isolating immersion of the (non) reading eye in the bar- renness of desert-like white pages punctuated by static-filled photographs of technological nothingness. Such photographs, are only a visualization of the desire for such connection. In other words, the drifting dynamic between non- intelligibility and the subsequent presumption of intelligibility necessarily co- 102 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="11">erces an experience of the difference. The movement makes discernible the bare reality that one has moved, or been moved, from one critical angle of vi- sion into another - and is therefore implicated actively instead of passively in relation to the spectacular pageantry that surrounds, divides and multiplies him infinitely. The figural force generated from this creative/interpretive movement - the improvisatory dynamic of a reading that necessarily amounts to a writing - is only the fiercely literary replay of a dynamic governing the economic character of the social. When Amiri Baraka writes that "Art is po- litical by its very nature," always reflective of the value systems that inform it - and therefore another potential means of "getting sucked back into ideol- ogy, he is also saying that such risky exposure is necessarily part of its man- date. {Conversations 92) For Adorno, such aesthetic dynamics are always "the sedimentations or imprintings of social relations of production. Art's double character as both autonomous and fait social is incessantly reproduced on the level of its autonomy" (166). In its own stylistic and philosophical disengagements, Rankine's interplay of text and image not only slides beyond any hierarchical divide between the two (what about an image is non-textual? what about a text is non-imagistic?) Her work reformulates the urgency of central questions animated notably in those later works of Lyotard, going so far as to liquidate the "presence" help- lessly re-introduced by the very form of those questions that would eviscerate that presence. "Where do you criticize from?" Lyotard demands. "Don't you see that criticizing is still knowing, knowing better? That the critical relation still falls within the sphere of knowledge, of 'realization' and thus of the assumption of power?" (13) Rankine certainly appears to know better than Lyotard the necessity of changing the grain or edge of that interrogative voice. What I try to share in this space is that this American Lyric elaborates, at both the levels of the image and the sentence, a charged language of power- lessness, itself the vehicle of a "drifting" perspective whose angularity of en- trance and indeed, whose "low affect" unobtrusively interrupts the presumptive real power - the unchallenged transparency and continuity - of the televised image of "news," "reality programming" or advertisement and the representa- tional system of which these are only louder elements. The accumulation of incendiary effects produced by the exactitude of this withdrawal - a with- drawal not only from the matrices of global capital and the inescapable waves of noise that are its most powerful instrument, but more comprehensively a withdrawal from the very idea that the enormity of globalism's consequences can even be put into words - may originate within a self-contradictory passiv- ity. Not for nothing is the reader of this text required as a condition of that reading to literally watch television. The work induces and performs the "can't get out of bed, can't get off the couch" passivity to which it constantly refers, making itself heard only in the beaten, depressed tonalities of exhaustion, Unheard Writing in the Climate of Spectacular Noise / Kevin Bell Vol. 3:1 103</page><page sequence="12">anxiety and ongoing loss or defeat. But at no point does this passivity equate to an acceptance - for who, or what, is left to accept or reject anything in this text? Who is to decide or judge, when every movement and recording of social abjection in the text is in some way already the outcome of such untroubled exercise of "agency?" In other words, its image/text re-opens the question of how aesthetic activity is always regulated by and always resistant to impera- tives of conceptual - which is to say historico/political functionality. For not only do the still images of this televised nothingness arrest us in a continual sequence of staring non-comprehensions; nor only do they indicate to us that we are turning the page to find new figural reflection - but they also alert us to our own deep and drowsy implicatedness within a scene of ongoing com- mercialist self-reifications and dispossessions. A scene from which we might be momentarily wrenched in the duration of working through the words and silences that the snowy images of televised nothingness bracket. DEAD CHILD WATCHING Something in excess of its placement; something seen, heard, sensed, or other- wise lived, that at the same time cannot be named without falsification of this otherwise, this see-ing, hear-ing, or sen-sing, escapes from the texts photo- graphic insert of the televised image of 13 -year-old Lionel Tate who is sitting as a defendant in a Florida courtroom, his mother seated next to him. Tate, who in 2001 was tried and convicted as an adult for the first- degree murder in 1999 (when he was 12) of a playmate, a six-year-old girl named Tiffany Eunick, became the youngest person ever sentenced in the United States to life in prison without parole. Tate's central defense was that he had not intended to injure or kill the child but that he had done so inadvertently in a playful moment of imi- tating professional wrestling maneuvers he had seen performed on television. The muteness of what escapes the photographic insert redoubles the resonance of the image. This muteness - the differing modes of helplessness and speech- lessness that register on each of the faces; of the child on trial, looking quizzi- cally into the face of his mother; and of the mother of that child, looking elsewhere, downward; both pictured with lips parted, eyes searching, as if each is trying and failing to find the words; the un-arrestable un-decidability of how to characterize either what has happened already or what is happening now - is an embedded and ongoing thematic of impossibility in Rankine's text, an ex- cess of information and thought requiring some new mutation of form that will respect that thinking's search for another expressivity. I, or we, it hardly matters, seek out the story in the Times. The girl had a torn liver, fractured skull and broken ribs - perhaps there was more. In any case, her time is done. The boy was tried as an adult or he was tried 104 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="13">as a dead child. There are no children anymore, at least not this boy - this boy who is only a child. But then, what child behaves like this? What child behaves like this, knows the consequences, and still insists he was playing at being a wrestler? To know and not to understand is perhaps one definition of being a child. Or responsibility is not con- nected to sense-making, the courts have decided. In this moment, we are alone with the facts as he will be when he under- stands. In the time it takes for the appeal to happen he will be a dead child in an adult prison. He will be alive as someone else. He will be there with adults and because his life is happening in this way, he will forever happen in our minds as a dead child. I see the tears have run relatively parallel down his mother's cheeks. What I have is a headache. On the Tylenol bottle someone has made a distinction between adults and children. I, as an adult, am allowed two tablets. As I stare at the label, from somewhere a voice whispers in my ear: Take comfort in our strength. The words conjure the ineffable truth of what the photograph discovers and silences at once - that while the fugitivity of a real sound we cannot hear, or a glance we do not catch, or a phrase we do not comprehend is a wound that can still be documented or registered by other affective means, such means can only work at an eternal distance from the project of knowing. What this composi- tion of image and text makes plain yet again is the Janus-like status of both the picture and the language that simultaneously enframes and isolates it. Each is the vehicle of communicative possibility and each is the densest obstacle to such communication - each, in its presumptive transparency opens a fissure in the ways we presume to look into suffering, loss, and the fragility of relation- ships whose shape and singularity only emerge in the moment we realize the humiliating inadequacy of the terms (mother, friend, adult, child, live, die) by which we would arrest the movements and alterations that alone constitute them. In other words, when we engage images of such relationships in the pre- sumption that such relationships can be known, the images themselves tend to look elsewhere, eluding conceptual arrest; much as we deny the affective escape of other experiences that exceed our social terminologies and taxonomies. The organizing uncertainties and self-negations of these passages - "I or we, it hardly matters;" "perhaps there was more;" "the boy was tried as an adult or he was tried as a dead child," to name only the first three - animate in words the mode of a fugitivity opened by the photographed, televisual image of helplessness inserted above the text. With the exception of the third, every sentence in the first paragraph contains a phrase undone or at least loosened severely by either the preceding or subsequent phrase. Each of these sentences abandons its presumably constative drive toward the establishment of a final judgment, giving way instead to a performative drift that keeps itself radically Unheard Writing in the Climate of Spectacular Noise / Kevin Bell Vol. 3:1 105</page><page sequence="14">open to the non-understanding that preceded it. Such drift moves toward the material plurality of forces that always splinter and invalidate the reductive juridical and journalistic programs of adjudicating/isolating criminality from playful innocence, "childhood" from "adulthood," and further exposes, by way of a modulated playing back of each discourse to itself, the audacity and vio- lence of the word that presumes to know and preside over differences that are too complex, too mutually constitutive to be reduced to oppositions; differ- ences that have yet to make themselves understood in idioms not yet adminis- tered to us. Rankine's importation of doubt into the mix exposes the regressive media- cratic language of spectacularly self-installed authority whose enveloping drone, in its inability to measure itself. Historicizing a reality marginalized by the 24-hour cable-news sound-tracking affixed to it, Rankine's auto-suspending lines reconfigure a doubt, an indeterminacy that alone would expose the pre- tense of whatever substantiality might be inferred from the wall-to-wall "cover- age" of salaried talking heads who administer the public its understanding of the case. Suffocated under the waves of video-noise that consciously wash over it - consciously indeed, for such awareness of self-incapacity would be the only possible genesis or of those presumably compensatory waves - is precisely the individuated, speechless "inarticulacy" (Nathaniel Mackey's term) of the void from which such indeterminate either/ors as Rankine proposes can emerge. Such is the unheard movement of the eyes and lips in the photographic frozen- ness of Lionel Tate and Kathleen Tate that blasts us out of the mediated cul- tural continuum by which we presume to know and understand whatever onto-juridical difference is supposed to distinguish child from adult, criminal- ity from play. The unheard movement of the photograph "might not," in Fred Moten's words, "get you where the word or the sentence gets you, but might get you past the word's or the sentence's limits; or, even better, might take the word or the sentence past its own limits." Such is the project of critical transport opened by Don t Let Me Be Lonely. It is not so much to disavow or even unlearn the languages of material survival, acquisitiveness and domination we've ab- sorbed, as to somehow work beyond the world established in the terms and on the models of such languages. To attune ourselves not so much to the sub- merged sounds of what escapes the lips of a child on trial for murder as he asks his mother something in a camera-filled courtroom, as to attune ourselves to that pitch ofneed\ to decipher what grips the dying hand to carve an inscription of its possessor's inner horror on a small blackboard in a retirement home and to converse with that pitch of impossibility. Such an effort of attunement might move us into another order of fluency altogether, in which we might discover, among other things, the more obliquely inventive "inarticulacies" animating long-discarded and dispossessed communities in America. Rankine shapes new forms from the essential dispossession at the foundation of all our political 106 Vol 3:1 The Global South</page><page sequence="15">presuppositions, dependencies and placebos - always with the continual turn- ing toward a not-yet, that she reads and re-projects as the futurity of those who, so far, have not been able to get their long-submerged and therefore "new" idi- oms respected publicly.
