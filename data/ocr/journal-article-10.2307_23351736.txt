<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Loewe, Divination, Mythology and Monarchy in Han China. University of Cambridge Oriental Publications 48. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. xix + 353 pp. reviewed by Mark Csikszentmihalyi Divination, Mythology and Monarchy in Han China is a collection of thir teen articles by Michael Loewe of Cambridge University, the foremost historian of Han dynasty China. All of the articles have been previously published over the period 1978 to 1992, and are arranged here by their year of publication. In a few instances, modest emendations have been inserted in brackets. The articles are preceded by a valuable thirty-eight page introduction on the "history of the early empires" and are followed by a glossary, bibliography, and index. As such, Divination, Mythology and Monarchy in Han China is in the genre of collectanea of notable authors; one might look to the Han scholar Lu Jia's H jf Xinyu (New discourses), upon which Loewe's volume draws for some of its subject matter, for a more ancient precedent. As it happens, Lu Jia's work might also have been subtitled Divination, Mythology and Monar chy in Han China just as this work could be accurately entitled Michael Loewe's New Discourses. Since works of this genre afford the reader not only a perspective on a variety of subtopics, but also an opportunity to reflect on the methods and approach of the author, this review will describe (and where applicable, update) the thirteen articles while attempting to situate the articles in the broader context of Loewe's con tribution to and perspective on Han dynasty studies. Divination, mythology, and monarchy only begin to cover the range of subjects treated in this collection. What the articles have in common is that at the center of each is some type of text, broadly construed. Since his 1963 dissertation at the University of London on the Juyan wooden strips, many of Loewe's works have been based on explaining aspects of Han history by explicating a text or a genre of texts. Indeed, many articles in the collection under consideration are basically an exe gesis of one text, usually one discovered by archaeologists, accomplished Early China 21 (1996)</page><page sequence="2">202 BOOK REVIEWS with recourse to a series of related texts that have been more or less continuously transmitted since the days of the early empire. This methodology is employed to an end that is subtly different from the one that Loewe might have pursued twenty years ago. His earliest work was marked by the valuation of political, military, and intellectual history. However, as the type of evidence that he examined broadened to incorporate art and funerary objects in the late 1970's, so too did his attention shift to the aspects of Han society not so well preserved in the literary record. Today, Loewe writes in the introductory essay that the work in this collection derives from a conviction that "it is not possible to treat individual aspects of Chinese history in isolation, and that devel opments such as dynastic sequence, political changes, intellectual growth or religious influences must be seen as affecting one another" (p. 37). This statement of principle is amply illustrated in the thirteen articles, which examine evidence ranging from meteorological divina tion charts to funerary art and almanacs. Just as the subject matter varies across the volume, so too does the degree of familiarity with the Han dynasty assumed in each piece. It is characteristic of Loewe's scholarship that he is at home writing for the nonspecialist and for the specialist. In popular works such as Imperial China: The Historical Background to the Modern Age (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1966) and the more recent survey The Pride that was China (Lon don: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1990), as well as in more synthetic treatments of broad topics such as Everyday Life in Early Imperial China during the Han Period, 202 b.c.-a.d. 220 (London: Batsford, 1968), Chinese Ideas of Life and Death: Faith, Myth and Reason in the Han Period (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1982), and Crisis and Conflict in Han China (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1974), Loewe's particular systematizing sensibility has allowed him to write valuable introductions to the social, religious, and political history of early dynastic China at a time when very few translations of basic primary materials existed in Western languages. Occasionally, problems arise when the categories developed for these nonspecialist introductions filter into his work aimed at the specialist. Nevertheless, Loewe has done more than anyone to make the Han accessible to virtually any English reader who might be interested. I will revisit these aspects of Loewe's work after summarizing the individual sections of the collection. The introductory essay of the volume, "The History of the Early Empires," provides a descriptive summary of the basic sinological work on the Han in Western languages over the last century. Many impor tant archaeological reports and selected secondary works from China and Japan during the last century are also included. Loewe's model is</page><page sequence="3">MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI 203 one of cumulative progress in a growing field, and his brief and non judgmental summaries would make this essay a logical starting point for a graduate student setting out to develop a curriculum for a com prehensive exam involving the Qin and Han periods. The degree of thoroughness is so high that most readers are sure to find useful refer ences to finds or articles that have otherwise escaped notice. I certainly was not aware that the seal presented to the king of Dian vjt (which overlaps modern Yunnan Province) in 109 b.c.e.1 appears in a 1959 archaeological report. For anyone interested in locating the seal, the report, page number, and even the plate number are all provided. Cat egories that might have received more coverage are the works of the Han medical corpus2 and the weishu Pf-#t or "apocrypha,"3 two of the few Han topics on which Loewe has not yet published. The second piece, numbered as chapter 1, "Man and Beast: The Hybrid in Early Chinese Art and Literature," is a foray into the history of Chinese art, and first appeared in Numen the year before the publication of Loewe's related study of iconography and immortality, Ways to Paradise: The Chinese Quest for Immortality (London: Allen and Unwin, 1979). This article uses both material culture and the text of the Shanhaijing |ij '/Sll to explore the significance of animal and human-animal hybrids appear ing on the celebrated Chu Silk Manuscript discovered in 1942.4 Loewe makes several claims about these hybrids. One of the most noteworthy is that depictions of animals were given human features during the Cf. Hanshu /JUr (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1962), 95.3842. 2. Particularly noteworthy studies are Donald Harper, "The Wu shih erh ping fang: Translation and Prolegomena" (Ph.D. diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1982) and Shigehisa Kuriyama, "Varieties of Haptic Experience: A Comparative Study of Greek and Chinese Pulse Diagnosis" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1986). Many of the recently discovered medical texts also receive treatment in Yamada Keiji |_L| EHlK JHL ed., Shin hatsugen Chugoku kagakushi shiryo no kenkyu (Kyoto: Kyoto daigaku jinbun kagaku kenkyujo, 1985); and Ma Jixing Mazvangdui gu yishu kaoshi (Changsha: Hunan kexue jishu, 1992). A summary and review of some relevant secondary materials is in Fabrizio Pregadio, "The Medical Texts of Ma-wang-tui," Cahiers d'Extreme-Asie 5 (1989-90), 381-86. 3. The publication of the six volume Jiishu issho shusei ed. Yasui Kozan Jljgrfflij and Nakamura Shohachi cf'Wjjt A (Tokyo: Meitoku, 1971-1992), has opened access to these materials; work such as Anna Seidel's "Imperial Treasures and Taoist Sacraments: Taoist Roots in the Apocrypha," in Taoist and Tantric Studies in Honour ofR.A. Stein, v. 2, ed. M. Strickmann (Brussels: Institut Beige des Hautes Etudes Chinoises, 1983), 291-371, gives a good introduction to how these texts may have fit into late Han and post-Han religious developments. 4. Loewe follows Noel Barnard in dating the discovery of the manuscript to 1934. For the 1942 date, see Li Ling Zhongguofangshu kao cj3 ill fflj# (Beijing: Renmin zhongguo, 1993), 171.</page><page sequence="4">204 BOOK REVIEWS fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e., a time when myths were increasingly being seen as historical facts. This claim, that the anthropomorphism of animals and the reverse-euhemerization of mythical humans were parallel processes, is an extremely interesting one, and raises several questions. Loewe begins the article by reiterating the juxtaposition between the "natural, romantic, and free" southern tradition and a "for mal, classical, and inhibited" northern tradition. Since the examples of hybridization that Loewe cites are almost exclusively from Chu (the southern tradition), what would it mean if reverse-euhemerization should be similarly restricted to the same area? And if, as Bodde has claimed, the standard process in China is the reverse of Euhemerus's claim that the origin of myth is history, what accounts for the parallels Loewe finds with hybrids in Western art? A reader might do well to compare some of the ideas about the function of animal depictions here with Sarah Allan's use of the category of totem.5 Loewe offers two dif ferent interpretations of the hybrids in the Chu Silk Manuscript, as depictions of the twelve guardian gods (associated with the twelve months) or as depictions of twelve mediums capable of communicating with the guardian gods. The antlers or horns on most of the figures are taken by Loewe to indicate "superhuman authority, capable of ward ing off evil spirits and guaranteeing everlasting life" (p. 46), something they have in common with the protective and auspicious figures on the largest of the three nested inner coffins discovered at tomb number one at Mawangdui ,^3E±£I (although they lack the overtly aggressive streak displayed by many of the figures among the latter group). Chapter 2, "Water, Earth and Fire: The Symbols of the Han Dynasty," and chapter 4, "The Authority of the Emperors of the Qin and Han," both treat the legitimation of imperial authority in the early empire. The former article, originally appearing in a festschrift for Werner Eichhorn, explores appeals to the theory of the five phases to explain dynastic succession at different points during the Han dynasty. Not only did the dominant "patron" phase change from water to earth in 104 b.c.e., and then to fire a little over a century later, but Loewe points 5. Sarah Allan, "Sons of Suns: Myth and Totemism in Early China," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 44 (1981), 290-326; and The Shape of the Turtle (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991). Allan sees totemism as a means to order the world "which includes an analogy between man and animals or other natural objects" (The Shape of the Turtle, 46). This sort of reading would imply hybrids might be instances of a more universal impulse to locate humans in terms of the natural world. However, elsewhere Allan contrasts the "illustrative" nature of the Chu Silk Manuscript figures with the more "mythic" figures from Shang dynasty materials (The Shape of the Turtle, 127). This is more consistent with a functional explanation of the figures similar to the ones Loewe proposes, for example as depictions of shamans.</page><page sequence="5">MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI 205 out that the model of succession of the phases changed from one of conquest to one of natural growth. Correspondingly, the sequence changed from the earth, wood, metal, fire, water order associated with the Warring States figure Zou Yan fPftj to the perhaps more familiar wood, fire, earth, metal, water. This change in the model of the succes sion of the phases had implications which are worked out more thor oughly in the second of these two articles, which originally appeared in a festschrift for Karl Biinger. This chapter treats not only the succession of the five phases and the related topic of the interpretation of portents during the Eastern Han, but also details the type of political ritual used to demonstrate the moral and cosmological legitimacy of the Han emperors. In the process, Loewe posits a shift from the "negative" por tent (i.e. those which bode ill for the ruler) to the "positive" portent (boding well) and locates the shift in the reign of Xuandi (r. 74-49 b.c.e.). These two chapters constitute a clear introduction to the cosmological foundation of imperial authority during the Han. The only addendum one might hazard is Mu Hong's WjiL. interpretation of the spontaneous appearance of a boulder on Mount Tai and the revival of a dry fallen tree in the Shanglin preserve in 79 b.c.e., which has been read as the first recommendation that fire be the phase associated with the Han.6 The topic of the foundation of imperial authority is revisited in the thirteenth and final chapter of the collection, a noteworthy article called "The Imperial Tombs of the Former Han Dynasty and their Shrines." Originally appearing in 1992 in T'oungPao, this piece examines the debate over the shrines of earlier Han emperors during the reign of Yuandi (r. 48-33 b.c.e.). At issue were the ritually proper location for the burial of each emperor, the necessity of maintaining the associated shrines of increasingly distant imperial ancestors, and the revival of the zhaomu Bp system of the arrangement of associated shrines thought to have been in use in the Zhou dynasty. An official's position on these issues was considered to be an important political litmus test until the matter was finally settled by Aidi (r. 7-1 b.c.e.); it was not revisited due to the break in dynastic succession less than a decade later. Loewe's reading of these issues as an example of Zhou revivalism squares well with cotemporal developments in state worship and the bureaucracy. 6. The event is recorded in Hanshu, 7.228; Mu Hong's interpretation is in Hanshu, 75.3153-54. Qi Shaonan W/S $9 sees this as the first time that the Han is related to the sage-king Yao (Hanshu buzhu yJUffSrii [Beijing: Zhonghua, 1983], 75.1b) and therefore to the element fire. Li Hansan has singled this event out as the first evidence of the change between the conquest and the natural growth models of the five phases (Xian Qin Hang Han zhi yinyang wuxing xueshuo [Taibei: Weixin, 1981], 118).</page><page sequence="6">206 BOOK REVIEWS Chapter 3, "The Han View of Comets," and chapter 9, "The Oracles of the Clouds and the Winds," are both valuable treatments of the silk chart discovered in tomb number three at Mawangdui, which has been assigned the title Tianwen qixiang zazhan (Miscellaneous divinations by heavenly patterns and qi images). The chart contains a set of drawings of phenomena which today might roughly be described as "astrological" and "meteorological," and are combined with militarily oriented oracles. The first article, originally appearing in 1980 in the Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, is a thorough examination of comets depicted in the chart and their relation to material on comets in transmitted texts; translations of several passages from historical works that record such meteorological phenomena are appended. The second article appeared in the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies eight years later and discusses oracles associated with the cloud images in the chart, as well as the oracles based on qualities of the wind documented in the standard histories. Loewe convincingly links the former set of oracles, those associated with cloud images and concerned with military movements in different states, to earlier texts which indi cate that clouds were seen as directly observable qi H, and to later charts which preserve very similar oracles. The set of oracles associated with the wind include some especially interesting methods. Loewe summa rizes one as "different combinations of rain, cloud, wind, and sun during the day permit a prognostication of the quality of the harvest, as if the weather conditions of the day in question were a micro-image of the weather of the whole of the year to come" (p. 202); another method is based on the musical pitch of "the sound of the people of the cities" on a clear day (p. 203). It should be noted that since Loewe first wrote his articles, a more detailed reproduction of the Mawangdui chart and a new set of annotations have been published, and therefore certain gen eral points about the text have been clarified. For instance, the text is a 7. It is possible that the chart was compiled from three texts or that three diviners, whose names and readings are provided in the chart, were on hand to provide their interpretations of a common set of diagrams. See Yamada Keiji, Shin hatsugen Chugoku kagakushi, v. 1 (Yakuchu hen ffiiliO/ 45-86. Yamada adopts the reconstructed arrange ment of the chart and transcription of the Guojia wenwuju guwenxian yanjiushi pub lished in Zhongguo wenwu ^^^^ 1 (1979), 1-4 and 26-29. A more detailed color reproduction of a different arrangement of the chart may be found in Fu Juyou f-fSf?l and Chen Songchangffi&amp;M;, Mawangdui Hanmu wenwu (Chang sha: Hunan, 1993), 154-56. For an attempt to situate the methods of the chart in the intellectual context of the time, see Mark Csikszentmihalyi, "Emulating the Yellow Emperor: The Theory and Practice of HuangLao, 180-141 b.c.e."

A more general essay on divination during the Han is included as chapter 8, "Divination by Shells, Bones and Stalks during the Han Period." This essay, which originally appeared in T'oung Pao in 1988, treats an important topic, since systematic work on Han divination lags behind the research on Zhou period divination. Loewe's textual sources here are the chapters on divination in the Shiji and Hanshu. The article examines the myth and lore related to the turtle, the attitudes and con troversies surrounding divination, and divination by yarrow stalks. Loewe shows that the authors of texts like the Yantielun H ffc ire and Qianfulun ® Jz Ire were very concerned that the purpose and use of divination had changed from earlier times. He also examines how the objects of divination in the Han (e.g. determining the reliability of reports of robber activity) had evolved from those of pre-imperial times (e.g. determining the proper times for worship, sacrifice, or burial). The essay is an excellent general introduction to certain types of Han divination, and is attentive to the comparison with the tradition of Zhou divination from which Han practices drew their authority.8 Two short essays which explicate particular terms are chapter 5, "The Term K'an-yu and the Choice of the Moment," and chapter 11, "The Chue-ti Games: A Re-enactment of the Battle between Ch'ih-yu and Hsiian-yuan?" The former essay examines ten passages that refer to the form of divination termed kanyu (k'an-yu) J# §iL. Loewe's purpose in this essay is twofold: first, to discern as many details as possible about the divination practice; and second, to show the difference between the kanyu system and the jianchu ^ system attested in recently un earthed almanacs, and in so doing to correct the prevalent misidentifi cation of these oracles as solely connected with geomancy (see the notes on chapter 10 below). The short essay on thejuedi (chueh-ti) fr\ Jg games traces references to the Han rite that may have had its origin in a ritual re-enactment of the battle between the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi ft 8. A good example of evidence of the authority of Zhou divination during the Han is the divination scheme invented by Yang Xiong based on the Yijing HHL See Michael Nvlan's The Canon of Supreme Mystery (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1993).</page><page sequence="8">208 BOOK REVIEWS -fj?) and his rival Chiyou (Ch'ih-yu) Loewe also examines the rel evant Yellow Emperor lore, although these sections must be read in the light of the recent work on the same mythic themes by Mark Lewis and Michael Puett.9 The Western Han figure Dong Zhongshu Jrf'f'jt? is the subject of two chapters: chapter 6, "Imperial Sovereignty: Tung Chung-shu's Contribu tion and his Predecessors," and chapter 7, "The Cult of the Dragon and the Invocation for Rain." Originally published in edited collections in 1987, these articles prefigure recent work that has been done on Dong Zhong shu and his textual corpus. The first article delineates the influences which helped to shape Dong Zhongshu's theory of sovereignty. Loewe implies that Dong was the first political theorist to successfully provide a rationale for the existing government structure in imperial China. The article is somewhat inconclusive, but several points in it have been corrob orated by the recent parallel studies of Dong Zhongshu by Sarah Queen and Gary Arbuckle. These studies, while differing in many particulars, have succeeded in establishing the essentially composite character of the chief work traditionally ascribed to Dong Zhongshu, the Chunqiu fanlu #t^i8-10 Loewe notes inconsistencies between historical references to Dong and the contents of the Chunqiu fanlu (p. 123, n. 5), noting in particular the absence of references to yinyang and five phases theories in discussions of dynastic succession in Dong's memorials in Han histor ical records (p. 126), as well as the difference between the notion of cosmic order in the Huang-Lao "mode of thought" and in Dong's memo rials (p. 127). The thrust of chapter 6 is to compare Dong's political thinking to that of Lu Jia, Shusun Tong Jia Yi Jftt, and Jia Shan Jf (Jj, although the differences between them are not developed very clearly. By contrast, chapter 7 is a very cogent treatment of the received literature on Han rituals concerning dragons and rain, especially certain chapters of the Chunqiu fanlu. Again, recent work has borne out Loewe's conclu sions regarding the authenticity of certain chapters of that text.11 9. See especially chapter five of Mark Edward Lewis, Sanctioned Violence in Early China (Albany: State University of New York, 1990), which provides another perspec tive on the issue, but by no means supplants Loewe's discussion; and Michael Puett's perceptive treatment of the formation of myth and structural parallels with earlier myths in chapter four of his "The Ambivalence of Creation: The Rise of Empire in Early China" (Ph.D. diss., University of Chicago, 1994). 10. See Sarah Queen, "From Chronicle to Canon: The Hermeneutics of the 'Spring and Autumn Annals' According to Tung Chung-shu" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1994); and Gary Arbuckle, "Restoring Dong Zhongshu (b.c.e. 195-115): An Experiment in Historical and Philosophical Reconstruction" (Ph.D. diss., University of British Columbia, 1991). 11. Loewe's thesis is developed further by Sarah Queen in chapter three of From</page><page sequence="9">MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI 209 Chapter 10, "The Almanacs (jih-shu) from Shui-hu-ti: A Preliminary Survey" was published in Asia Major in 1988 as an introduction to the bamboo-strip manuscripts whose excavation in 1975 opened up new vistas on the understanding of Qin and Han divination practices involv ing the determination of auspicious and inauspicious days and times. While there have been significant advances since the publication of this article, it remains a good introduction to many aspects of the find and a useful summary of the evidence relating to the practices in received texts.12 Chapter 12, "Failure of the Confucian Ethic," published first in a festschrift for Tilemann Grimm in 1991, concerns the reasons for the decline of the Eastern Han dynasty. The article examines why the gov ernment ignored the "ethical and practical lessons of the past" (p. 253). Specifically, Loewe is concerned with the excess of corruption, a sign that the "Confucian ethic" was being ignored. It must be noted here that the "Confucian ethic" being discussed has little to do with Confucius or the broad set of virtues generally associated with Confucian ethics by philosophers. At issue instead is the subset of virtues which concern the duties of the emperor and officials in a bureaucratic setting. This Han concern for modesty in imperial expenditures and for the unselfish administration of an official's duties owes as much to the complex of late Warring States governance theories such as xingming as it does to Confucius. Loewe clearly details the increased energies which the government had to channel into combatting corruption and extrava gance, as well as the series of events which undercut imperial sover eignty. Perhaps a little uncritically, Loewe assumes the efficacy of an administration based on the "Confucian ethic" throughout, seeing such an ethic as a guarantee of the official integrity and incorruptibility that would have assured the survival of the dynasty. Reviewing such a broad spectrum of articles leaves little room for generalization, and in the case of a scholar as careful as Michael Loewe, Chronicle to Canon: The Hermeneutics of the Spring and Autumn According to Tung Chung Shu (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). 12.

This collection cannot but con firm Loewe's reputation as an erudite and conscientious scholar, and increase one's appreciation of the breadth of his scholarship. Even in the areas where Loewe does not blaze new trails, a contribution by him is sure to be valuable as a lucid and engaging expression of the state of the field on a particular topic. The publication of a collection like this, however, affords not only an opportunity to appreciate Professor Loewe's myriad strengths, but also an occasion for critical reflection on his method. Like many of the Han thinkers whose work he draws on, Loewe's genius is as a systematizer. In a manner similar to Yang Xiong's discovery of the eighty-one tetra grams which provide the key to understanding human affairs, or Dong Zhongshu's (or, pace the recent trend of scholarship, his school's) iden tification of the 360 human joints which have homologies in the cycles of the heavens, Loewe is adept at finding the patterns in Chinese history. He charts the mutual influence of phenomena in an attempt to ground historical events in the interaction between certain cultural categories instead of relying on mere chains of chronological causation. Indeed, Loewe's works often turn on the identification of a dialectic between two categories, such as the interplay between reformist and modernist or between the worship of di ^ and that of tian the counterpoint between faith and reason or between divination and science. This sys tematizing tendency has not only proven to be the basis of many of Loewe's insights, but also to be a pedagogically effective way of orga nizing Han history. At times, however, such a reduction of historical phenomena to simple dualisms has the potential to obfuscate as well as to clarify. For example, in the context of the Han dynasty Loewe often opposes the term "faith," which he applies to belief in omens and divination practices, to "reason," constituted by the rational explanation of the universe according to the principles of yinyang and the five phases. This usage is problematic on several levels. First, the use of these particular English terms invites, indeed forces, an implicit comparison with the corresponding Enlighten ment dichotomy, which is much starker than the one Loewe is describ ing. One senses that Loewe only intends to use such terms as a type of shorthand, because at times he expands his descriptions to incorporate needed nuance, as is the case with Wang Chong 3ijb, who in Loewe's words "argues the case for the spontaneity of natural processes as against a determinate interpretation of events" (pp. 224-25). Another problem is that the actual terms "faith" for belief in the effi cacy of divination and "reason" to describe yinyang and the five phases theory can also be misleading. When it is queried whether Dong</page><page sequence="11">MARK CSIKSZENTMIHALYI 211 Zhongshu might have been aware of a "conflict between faith and rea son" (p. 135) it becomes clear that these labels have led to the conflation of the concepts of one cultural system with those of another.13 This is not simply an issue of translation, but goes to the essence of interpret ing history across cultures. If Wang Chong is a "rationalist" what exactly can this mean in the absence of a corresponding Han category of ratio nality? It is when expedient categories such as these filter in from his writing for nonspecialists that Loewe occasionally betrays his stated principle that "it is not possible to treat individual aspects of Chinese history in isolation." By the use of such categories, individual aspects of Chinese history remain segregated, and the enormous potential of the Chinese example to problematize categories developed according to specific historical examples in the West is bypassed. This is surely the only sense in which this excellent collection may be said to disappoint. For many of us whose exposure to the Han had first been through the writings of Michael Loewe, the articles it contains are like welcome installments of a favorite serial. The volume itself is hand somely produced. The standards of typography and editorial care in Divination, Mythology and Monarchy in Han China are such that I cannot recall having seen a work less encumbered by the standard errors that tend to appear in sinological works. It might be argued that reprinting a set of articles already available in most university libraries is not an optimal use of resources. One response would be that the comprehensive index makes this a valuable reference volume in the way that vertical files of copied articles cannot be. Another would be that, our standards of textual dissemination being somewhere between the situation in which manuscripts on silk and wood are transported by carriage and the wishful circumstance in which comprehensive bibliographic searches and retrievals are carried out at the push of a button, the rationale for publishing such collections, as long as they are of the quality of this one, must still be considered valid. 13. It is not clear that such a conflict existed anywhere in the early period—it has been argued that for the early Greeks, natural philosophy was originally more of a "faith/' only later to become subject to empirical verification. See, for example, Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, Magic, Science, Religion, and the Scope of Rationality (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 10.</page></plain_text>
