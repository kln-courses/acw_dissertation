Wanner GOD ON  THE  MARGINS :   DISLOCATION  AND  TRANSIENCE  IN  THE   MYTHS  OF  ÓD INN space, time, and the history of religions The works of  Mircea Eliade are suffused by a concern with religious conceptions of  space and time, above all with the ways in which myths, rituals, and symbols serve to link the profane with the sacred, to maintain humanity’s connection to the cosmic center and eternity. In The Myth of the Eternal Return, Eliade claims to demonstrate how “archaic ontology— more precisely, the conceptions of  being and reality that can be read from the behavior of  the man of  the premodern societies”—seeks to ground human institutions and practices “in a reality that transcends them.”1 Indeed, Eliade argues, it is only to the extent that these are held to par- ticipate in transcendent reality that they are considered real at all. In terms of  space, this means that significant loci “are invested with the prestige of  the Center,” and regarded as an “axis mundi . . . the meeting point of  heaven, earth, and hell.”2 In terms of  time, this means that a sig- nificant event or action is associated with a “divine model, an archetype,” and “acquires effectiveness to the extent to which it exactly repeats an act performed at the beginning of  time by a god, a hero, or an ancestor.”3 In 1 Mircea Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return; or, Cosmos and History, trans.

The effect and purpose of  assimilating human and terrestrial phenomena to cosmic centers and aboriginal events are to transport them “from the ephemeral and illusory to reality and eternity” and provide them with “a meaning and transhistorical justification.”4 Eliade’s preoccupations have continued to inform the interests of scholars of  religion. While some persist in using his categories and ideas about sacred space and time uncritically, others have suggested ways in which they ought to be modified or replaced. The most trenchant critiques have been directed at his notions of  sacred space, particularly his privi- leging of  symbolism of  the center. Leading this charge has been Jonathan Z. Smith, whose first tentative challenge to Eliade was raised in his 1972 essay “The Wobbling Pivot,” wherein he likens himself  to “the pygmy standing on the giant’s shoulders but without the attendant claim of having seen further.”5 Smith would grow more confident in works such as To Take Place (1987), in which he contends that in the ancient Near East, the context to which he traces the roots of  Eliade’s thinking about sacred space, the “language of  ‘center’ is preeminently political and only sec- ondarily cosmological. It is a vocabulary that stems, primarily, from archaic ideologies of  kingship and the royal function. . . . [While] it cannot be claimed that the pattern of  the ‘Center’ is a fantasy . . . the burden of proof  has shifted to those who will claim that a particular cultural con- struction represents a ‘Center’. The ‘Center’ is not a secure pattern to which data may be brought as illustrative; it is a dubious notion that will have to be established anew on the basis of  detailed comparative en- deavors.”6 If  the center cannot be considered a universal pattern, Smith suggests that at least two models or “maps” are needed to understand how space is conceptualized religiously: “a locative vision of  the world (which emphasizes place) and a utopian vision of  the world (using the term in its strict sense: the value of  being in no place).”7 Smith also labels these orientations “cosmological conviction” versus “cosmic paranoia,” the former referring to outlooks in which “the meaning of  life is rooted in an encompassing cosmic order in which man, society and the gods all par- ticipate” and in which it is humanity’s purpose to align itself  “with the great rhythms of  cosmic destiny and order,” the latter to those in which 4 Ibid., 18, 147. 5 Jonathan Z.

While chiefly a revision of  Eliade’s thinking on space, Smith’s system of  maps does not ignore the dimension of  time. Among the groups that Smith identifies as utopian in outlook are various brands of  gnostics and cargo cults, the following of  Jim Jones, and yogic reform movements of ancient India, all of  which are marked as much by apocalyptic expec- tations or otherworldly soteriologies as by spatial or social marginality.9 In other words, such groups share a conviction that the peripheral position they are forced to endure in this world will be compensated for on a higher plane or rectified in a world to come. As such, Smith’s critique leaves Eliade’s ideas about sacred time largely untouched: rather than challenge the locative claim that human values and institutions are anchored in an objective order, the utopian perspective shifts such orders’ location from the here-and-now to the elsewhere-and-elsewhere. In this sense, Smith’s utopian map functions very much like Peter Berger’s “self-transcending” or “messianic-millenarian” theodicies, those that offer “religious legitimation of  anomic phenomena” (i.e., those that threaten a culture’s nomos, or worldview) through individual absorption into pantheistic reality or by interpreting present misfortune “by reference to a future nomization.”10 What is more, while Berger’s focus in The Sacred Canopy remains assiduously anthropological as opposed to onto- logical, he is generally supportive of  Eliade’s ideas about how religion functions to provide a sense of  permanence and meaning to otherwise transient and meaningless existence.11 The most potent form of  nomization is, for Berger, cosmization, and religion is, in turn, cosmization’s most effective mode, involving the equation of  nomos, or meaningful order, with cosmos, the order of  reality; its primary function, he writes, is to “ground 8 Ibid., 132 (here quoting Cornelius Loew, Myth, Sacred History, and Philosophy: The Pre-Christian Religious Heritage of the West [New York: Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World, 1967], 5), 133, 139. 9 Ibid., 309; Jonathan Z.

Berger, The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion (New York: Anchor, 1967), 55, 63, 69. 11 Echoing Eliade, Berger speaks of  religion and the “socially established nomos” it protects as components of  “a shield against terror” and “the danger of  meaninglessness” (ibid., 22). </page> <page sequence="4"> History of Religions 319 the socially defined reality . . . in the ultimate reality of  the universe, in reality ‘as such’. The institutions are thus given a semblance of  inevita- bility, firmness and durability that is analogous to these qualities as ascribed to the gods themselves.”12 This vision of  religion as an instru- ment of  transcendentalization/eternalization par excellence that, when effective, cloaks historical, that is ephemeral and contingent, phenomena in a sacred, that is, enduring and absolute, aura has remained prevalent, even among some who have otherwise sought to distance themselves from the Eliadean paradigm. To take a notable example, Bruce Lincoln has described religion as “a human discourse that constructs itself  as divine and unfailing” as well as “that discourse [along with associated practices and institutions] whose defining characteristic is its desire to speak of  things eternal and transcendent with an authority equally tran- scendent and eternal.”13 Despite, then, their differences on many issues, all of  the above theorists make two basic claims: the first is that religion characteristically seeks to ground human or historical orders in a (or, from the typical religious per- spective, the) cosmic order; the second is that the latter order is equally characteristically regarded by the religious as eternal and absolute (though religious systems differ as to whether this order is present or deferred, immanent in this world or located outside or above it). These theorists posit, in short, that a defining feature of  religious worldviews is their roughly Platonic dualism, their propensity to split “reality” in two, into a realm of  becoming, that is, this world or the world of  matter, and a realm of  being, that is, the other world or the world of  spirit or mind, and to assign value and meaning intrinsically to the latter and only derivatively to the former. For whether we are considering religious conceptions of space or of  time, the central concern remains the assignation of  meaning (Eliade and Berger) or legitimacy/authority (Smith and Lincoln) to human phenomena and institutions, effected through their assimilation to a center, transcendent models, or eternal archetypes. In this article, it is my aim to question whether claims to centrality, transcendence, and permanence ought to be considered essential to the category “religion” by focusing on a set of  materials that most would label as religious, but which nevertheless seem to me to posit a world and operate according to principles far removed from Platonic meta- physics. The materials that suggest to me the need for this reevaluation are associated with Norse paganism, the traditions of  pre-Christian 12 Ibid., 36. 13 Bruce Lincoln, Holy Terrors: Thinking about Religion after September 11 (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 2003), 16, and “Theses on Method,” Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 8 (1996): 225. </page> <page sequence="5"> 320 God on the Margins northern Europe as preserved mainly in medieval Scandinavian and, above all, Icelandic sources. In particular, I will focus on myths of  the chief  god ÓDinn, material that, I will show, is dominated by motifs not of centrality and eternality but of  spatial marginality, social liminality, and ephemerality. This examination will fall into four parts: first, as a foun- dation for analysis I will provide an overview of  the sources for, charac- ter of, and scholarship on ÓDinn. Second, I will describe and offer some preliminary discussion of  the ways in which ÓDinn’s myths consistently place the god, in spite of  his paramount status in the Norse pantheon and cosmos, in situations of  dislocation and peril. Third, I will do the same for the ways in which ÓDinn is portrayed in his myths as engaged in a persistent yet ultimately—and explicitly—futile effort to combat his own and his order’s transience. Fourth and finally, I will seek to provide some sociologically grounded responses to two major questions posed by ÓDinn and the quality of  his mythos, the first of  which is of  primary relevance for studies of  medieval Norse culture, the second for general theory about religion: First, why is the central character of  Norse myth, as well as the patron deity of  such central figures of  medieval Norse society as kings and poets, so consistently placed at the center of  myths that themselves center around themes of  spatial, social, and temporal marginality? Second, given the pervasive assumption among scholars that religion aims to equate nomos with cosmos, what is one to make of  a mythos that goes out of  its way to depict the gods and the world they have constructed and over which they rule not as absolute and eternal but, quite the contrary, as contingent and transient? óD&amp; inn: sources, character, and scholarship The sources for ÓDinn are varied but can be lumped into several basic categories.14 None, it should be noted at the outset, can be regarded as purely pagan; since literacy advanced into the north alongside Chris- tianity, all of  our sources are subject in composition and/or recording to some degree of  Christian influence and interpretation. My use of  the terms “myth” and “mythology” is thus loose. Essentially, I treat any text in which ÓDinn appears or is described as contributing to his mythos, whatever 14 I do not deal with the nonliterary sources for ÒDinn, mainly rune stones and place names, in this article. Although much of  this material is by its nature older than the literary sources on which I focus and thus can be supposed to provide less mediated access to pre-Christian Norse religion, it is of  less use for reconstructing ÓDinn’s mythos, with which I am chiefly concerned, rather than his cult. At any rate, this material tends to reinforce the portrait of ÓDinn’s followers that I present in the final section of  my article, namely, that this god was of  most importance to a narrow but politically and culturally elite segment of  Norse society. For a recent discussion of  pre-Christian religion and cult based largely on this data, see Eric Christiansen, The Norsemen in the Viking Age (Oxford: Blackwell, 2002), 259–68. </page> <page sequence="6"> History of Religions 321 degree of  pagan authenticity it might be judged to have. This seems to me a valid approach given how consistent ÓDinn’s major character traits and narrative tropes remain across the sources. Probably the most valuable type of  source material for ÓDinn is poetry, both eddic and skaldic. “Eddic” refers to verse that is typically anonymous, emphasizes mythological or legendary themes, is narrative or dialogic/ didactic in form, and employs simpler meters and diction; six eddic lays prominently feature ÓDinn, and he appears or is mentioned in many of  the others.15 While individual poems are notoriously hard to date, the extant corpus of  eddic verse likely falls within the ninth to thirteenth centuries, the same that produced skaldic verse.16 “Skaldic” applies to verse that is typically ascribed to a named poet or skáld, focuses on historical persons or events, and employs highly ornate meters and diction; ÓDinn most often figures in these poems as an element of  kennings, circumlocutions that frequently reference myth.17 Closely linked to the verse sources is the Ice- lander Snorri Sturluson’s Edda, an early thirteenth-century mythographic and poetic treatise in which pagan myth and cosmology are presented in prose form and within a euhemeristic frame.18 Next, there are sagas that depict something of  ÓDinn’s character and deeds; these include so-called fornaldarsögur, or sagas of  ancient times, which, though many are late (thirteenth- and fourteenth-century), depict the god as a god, most often as he intervenes in human affairs, as well as skáldasögur and konungasögur, sagas of  poets and kings, which mainly describe how historic skalds, most of them Icelandic, and kings, most of 15 Those featuring ÓDinn are Völuspá, Hávamál, VafÂrúDnismál, Grímnismál, and Hár- barDsljóD—these five appearing in the Codex Regius, the main, mid-thirteenth century manu- script of  the eddic poems—as well as Baldrs draumar.

In line with his functions, ÓDinn was a patron of poets, warriors, kings and nobility, and, though this is less certain in terms of  the reality of  cult and practice, magicians or shamans.23 As to his status 19 On classifications and dating of  saga genres, see Kurt Schier, Sagaliteratur (Stuttgart: J.

Ellis Davidson, Gods and Myths of Northern Europe (London: Penguin, 1964), 25–32, 40–41, 48–72, 140–58. 23 The shamanic qualities of  ÓDinn’s character and mythos, particularly as they relate to his reputation as a practitioner of  seiDr, a potent but scandalous form of  magic with antiso- cial and effeminate associations, has been a recurrent preoccupation of  scholars (for primary sources identifying ÓDinn as seiDr practitioner, see Lokasenna 24 and Ynglinga saga 7). Many have argued for or against the view that the figure of  ÓDinn reflects Norse ideas about Finnish, or Saami, religious practice. While ÓDinn’s association with seiDr and the nomadic, far-northern Saami no doubt contributed to his marginal character—as Thomas A. DuBois writes, the shaman and seiDr user are both “liminal figures . . . whose sacral powers arose in part from their choice to assume a marginal, even pariah-like existence” (Nordic Religions in the Viking Age [Philadelphia: University of  Pennsylvania Press, 1999], 54)—I have not </page> <page sequence="8"> History of Religions 323 among the gods, the sources identify ÓDinn as their head and father, while also reporting his occasional discord with other deities, especially Êórr.24 There are also duplications of  function between ÓDinn and other gods (such as Êórr being also a god of  war) that have been taken as evidence of  development; specifically, it has been argued that ÓDinn is an import from continental German into Scandinavian religion and/or that he was a lesser god who rose to the top of  the ranks in the ninth and tenth centuries owing to his adoption and promotion by an emerging cultural and political elite.25 Finally, there is near consensus on the significance of  the god’s name. Adam of  Bremen writes of  “Wotan, id est furor,” and scholars concur that the root behind the deity’s name is *woÂ-, from whence comes German Wut, Anglo-Saxon wod, Old Norse óDr, and so on, all terms for “high mental excitement,” fury, ecstasy, or inspiration.26 ÓDinn’s name thus calls attention to a common link between his adherents: the professional success of  poets, warriors, and magicians depended, at least in principle, upon their accessing of  otherworldly power and inducing states of  in- spiration or frenzy. ÓDinn’s activity in the myths is frequently framed in reference to rag- narök, the “doom of  the gods” or, if  one adopts Snorri’s spelling ragnarøkr, stressed this element in this article, in part owing to considerations of  space but also because it has been extensively discussed by others, and because I doubt whether this aspect of  the god’s mythos is reflective of  his cult in the same way as his associations with kings and poets.

Schnurbein, “Sha- manism in the Old Norse Tradition: A Theory between Ideological Camps,” trans. Brian Currid, History of Religions 43, no. 2 (2003): 116–38. 24 This conflict is most obvious in the eddic poem HárbarDsljóD, though Gautreks saga 7 is also fairly explicit about it; for an edition of  the latter, see Wilhelm Ranisch, ed., Die Gau- trekssaga in zwei Fassungen (Berlin: Mayer &amp; Müller, 1900); for a translation, see Hermann Pálsson and Paul Edwards, trans., Gautrek’s Saga and Other Medieval Tales (London: Uni- versity of  London Press, 1968). Many have seen in the occasional discord between ÓDinn and Êórr a reflection of  social or class tensions. 25 Both theories are very common; see, e.g., arguments presented in Chadwick, Cult of Othin, 49–56; DuBois, Nordic Religions, 57–58; Jan de Vries, “Contributions to the Study of Othin,” Folklore Fellows Communications 94 (1931): 43–46, and Altgermanische Religions- geschichte, 2:46–49; and Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North, 64–70. 26 Adam of  Bremen, Hamburgische Kïrchengeschichte 4.26r, 258.

Another prominent theme in ÓDinn’s myths is the ambiguous nature of  his relations with his closest followers, elite warriors (above all kings) and poets. As I will describe further below, ÓDinn was notorious for withdrawing support from his favorites, bringing about sudden and disastrous reversals of  fortune. While the sources tend to justify this habit by the god’s need to amass a phantom army in preparation for ragnarök, scholars have dwelled on its moral valences: what sorts of  judgments, they ask, were passed on ÓDinn’s actions and motives, and by whom? E. O. G. Turville-Petre provides a rather extreme response to such questions, stating that in “the sources in which he is most fully described, he was evil and sinister,”28 while Jan de Vries takes a more measured view, writing that the “heathen warrior, who could experience the changeable luck of  war in every battle, likely scarcely brooded over ÓDinn’s unfaithfulness . . . but the poetry of  the later age became indignant at the fact that a god could act so faithlessly, and more sharply emphasized the god’s insidious character.”29 While de Vries assigns moral condemnation of  ÓDinn mainly to Christians, others have suggested that the god’s late ascension to the top of  the divine ranks and displacement of  other deities (and their adherents) generated resentment against him even in pagan times. As Thomas A. DuBois writes, “Tellingly, ÓDinn’s apparent rise to power in the Scandi- navian pantheon finds reflection in recurrent images of  him as a crafty, usurping, duplicitous deity, lacking in many accounts the unambiguously admirable qualities of  Êórr.”30 (Of  course, this ignores the fact that the latter deity was often depicted as an impulsively violent near imbecile.) While it is possible that ÓDinn’s late blooming and/or the conversion account for the sources’ ambivalence toward him, I will in what follows steer clear of  judging or rationalizing the god’s fickle character and instead emphasize the ways in which his ethical grayness ties into a much broader pattern of  liminality. ÓDinn’s myths are marked by instances of  treachery, but also by themes of  travel, exile, and disguise; he plays the role of  regi- cide, but also of  hall guest, hostage, impostor, and rapist. Considering the 27 See the glossary entry for this term in Snorri Sturluson, Edda: Prologue and Gylfag- inning, ed. Anthony Faulkes (Oxford: Clarendon, 1982), 132.

One Line Long </page> <page sequence="10"> History of Religions 325 overall character of  ÓDinn’s mythic itinerary, the most pressing question seems to me to involve not so much his adherents’ reactions as their iden- tities: why does the god especially attached to northern society’s dominant cultural and political agents, as well as to the primary consumers and producers of  our sources, so often skirt or push beyond territorial or moral boundaries? Or, to rephrase the question in terms of  the issues raised at the outset of  the article: if  ÓDinn is elite paganism’s central figure—and thus, according to an understanding of  religion as tool of  legitimation, the chief  symbolic guarantor of  Norse political, moral, and conceptual orders—why is he consistently made to operate from marginal positions? In considering these questions, I will concentrate on those myths that best illustrate the themes and patterns I wish to describe. The examples on which I focus are, however, neither isolated nor idiosyncratic, and ref- erences are given in the notes to episodes that could be substituted for or which complement those discussed. myths of spatial dislocation and social marginality Alongside Smith, another scholar of  religion who has paid a great deal of  attention to religious and cultural “maps” is Michel de Certeau. In The Practice of Everyday Life (1984), de Certeau draws a useful distinction between two forms of  practice, strategies versus tactics. A strategy he describes as “the calculation (or manipulation) of  power relationships that becomes possible as soon as a subject with will and power (a business, an army, a city, a scientific institution) can be isolated. It postulates a place that can be delimited as its own and serve as the base from which relations with an exteriority composed of  targets or threats (customers or competitors, enemies, the country surrounding the city, objectives and objects of  research, etc.) can be managed.” A tactic, on the other hand, de Certeau defines as a calculated action determined by the absence of  a proper locus. No delimitation of  an exteriority, then, provides it with the condition necessary for autonomy. The space of  a tactic is the space of  the other. Thus it must play on and with a terrain imposed on it and organized by the law of  a foreign power. . . . It must vigilantly make use of  the cracks that particular conjunctions open in the surveillance of the proprietary powers. It poaches in them. It creates surprises in them. It can be where it is least expected. It is a guileful ruse. In short, a tactic is an art of  the weak.31 According to these definitions, ÓDinn emerges from the sources as more tactician than strategist. To be sure, he has places to call his own: as a god, 31 Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life, trans. Steven Rendall (Berkeley: University of  California Press, 1984), 35–37. </page> <page sequence="11"> 326 God on the Margins he is one of  a divine trio who formed the cosmos out of  the body of  the murdered giant Ymir. He and his allies then inhabit ÁsgarDr, the garDr or enclosure of  the œsir, which stands opposed to Jötunheimar, the homes of  the jötnar. Within ÁsgarDr on the plain of  Gladsheimr sits Valhöll, the “hall of  the slain” where ÓDinn hosts the einherjar, the war dead whom his valkyrjur (sing. valkyrja) or “choosers of  the slain” collect from the battlefield, and he is attached to other dwellings, such as Válaskjálf  and Sokkvabekkr.32 Finally, he is said to possess HlíDskjálf, a panoptic seat or mountain shelf  from which he can view happenings in all worlds.33 As a human, ÓDinn is described by Snorri as having come originally from Troy in Turkey, “near the world’s middle,” and to have established realms for himself  and his sons throughout Europe, eventually settling in Sweden, while Saxo places him originally in Byzantium.34 It would seem, then, as if  ÓDinn, whether imagined as god or man, controlled plenty of  loci from which to set and pursue a strategic agenda. And yet, little in our sources indicates that ÓDinn is meant to occupy or symbolize a clearly defined or stable “center,” cosmic or other. While my discussions will focus on the extent to which the myths place ÓDinn in areas outside of  his control, the identification of  this or that context as marginal in the Norse cosmos is, it should be stressed, always relative. Kirsten Hastrup, who has written extensively on Norse conceptions of space, argues otherwise. In her view, the Norse possessed “a cosmo- logical model of  concentric circles” in which “the cosmos was divided into MiDgarDr and ÚtgarDr. MiDgarDr was the central space . . . inhabited by men (and gods), while ÚtgarDr was found ‘outside the fence’ . . . and inhabited by giants and non-humans. . . . The opposition between centre and periphery had connotations of  familiar versus foreign . . . [as well as] reflected the opposition between ‘the social’ and ‘the wild.’ ”35 This 32 Snorri provides an overview of  the ordering of  the cosmos and of  mythic topography in Gylfaginning 3–19. Many of  the details mentioned derive from Grímnismál, especially from verses 6–7 (Válaskjálf  and Sokkvabekkr), 8–10, 18–19, 21–23, and 25–26 (Valhöll and the einherjar). Some of  the account of  ÓDinn’s and his brothers’ use of  the body of  Ymir to form the world is from VafÂrúDnismál. 33 HlíDskjálf  as ÓDinn’s seat is not mentioned in eddic poetry, but it is named in the prose introductions to Grímnismál and Skírnismál; in Gylfaginning 17, Snorri places this seat in Válaskjálf  (and in Gylfaginning 9 in Troy; see next note). 34 “Nær miDri veröldunni” (Snorri Sturluson, Prologue 3, Faulkes ed., 4). Snorri places ÁsgarDr, home of  the human œsir, similarly in Ynglinga saga 2. For Saxo, see Gesta Danorum 1. Translations of  primary sources unless otherwise noted are my own, though I have consulted and in many cases stuck closely to Anthony Faulkes’s translation and glossaries for Snorri’s Edda and to Larrington’s translation of  the eddic poems (for full citations of Faulkes see nn. 17, 18, 27, and for Larrington see n. 15). 35 Kirsten Hastrup, “Cosmography,” in Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia, ed.

One Line Long </page> <page sequence="12"> History of Religions 327 division of  the Norse cosmos into central and peripheral zones is, how- ever, drastically overstated. As Margaret Clunies Ross has argued, any centrality that the gods possess is owed to “the insistently pro-god narra- torial point of  view of  myth rather than, as Hastrup has argued . . . a named division into MiDgarDr, ‘Middle Enclosure’ and ÚtgarDr, ‘Outer Enclosure.’ ”36 Clunies Ross further points out that while the former term is common enough in the sources, the latter is never used by poets and exactly once by Snorri, in a story that has Êórr travel east over the sea to the land of  ÚtgarDa-Loki, less a giant than a malevolent counterpart to the already ambiguous trickster “god” Loki.37 Aron Gurevich provides what is in my view a better description of  the Norse cosmos as “an aggregate of  farmsteads inhabited by people, gods, giants, and dwarfs,” wherein different sets of  beings are thought of  as in- habiting their own civilized zones.38 Nothing suggests, moreover, that the halls of  giants—or men, for that matter—are any less cultured or com- fortable than those of  the gods. Indeed, the many myths in which gods visit giants to secure, among other things, knowledge, a wife, a cauldron for brewing their mead, and a venue for their feasting suggest the opposite.39 Whether, then, one is thinking in topographical or cultural terms, the Norse cosmos lacks a clear axis mundi.40 More important, however, than ÓDinn’s lack of  control over a definite cosmic center is the fact that he spends so little time in those centers over which he exercises clear control. In Völuspá (The Völva’s prophecy) it is 36 Margaret Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Northern Society, vol. 1, The Myths (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), 51. 37 Ibid. 38 Aron Ya. Gurevich, “Space and Time in the Weltmodell of  the Old Scandinavian People,” Mediaeval Scandinavia 2 (1969): 45. 39 For example, ÓDinn travels to VafÂrúDnir’s hall to gain knowledge in VafÂrúDnismál, Freyr sends his servant Skírnir to the farm of  the giant Gymir to gain GerDr as a wife in Skírnismál, and Êórr and Tyr visit Hymir in HymskviDa to procure a cauldron to be used at Ægir’s feast in Lokasenna. 40 While Eliade would assign this role to Himinbjörg, according to him the “celestial mountain . . . where the rainbow (Bifrost) touches the dome of  heaven” (Mircea Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, trans. Rosemary Sheed [New York: Meridian, 1958], 100; see also Eliade, Myth of the Eternal Return, 12), such an exalted position for this site has no support in the sources: the name appears once in poetry as the hall of  the minor áss Heimdallr, and Snorri describes it as a watchman’s perch that stendr á himins enda (“stands at heaven’s end [or edge]” [Snorri Sturluson, in Gylfaginning 17, Faulkes ed., 20]). Even if  one follows many Norse scholars in regarding the tree Yggdrasill as a sort of  cosmic pillar, it must be admitted that no one class of  beings can lay claim to its center. According to Snorri, “three roots of  the tree hold it up and spread extremely widely. One is among the œsir, and another among the frost-giants. . . . The third stands over Niflheim [i.e., Hel]” (“Êrjár rœtr trésins halda Âví upp ok standa afar breitt. Ein er meD Ásum, en önnur meD hrímÂursum. . . . In ÂriDja stendr yfir Niflheimi” [Snorri Sturluson, in Gylfaginning 15, Faulkes ed., 17]), while in the eddic lay Grímnismál, Snorri’s source for this account, its roots lie in the homes of  Hel, the frost giants, and humans. In both sources, the œsir are described as having to ride over Bifröst or wade across rivers to attend court at a well feeding the tree’s roots. </page> <page sequence="13"> 328 God on the Margins told that “war, the first in the world, began between the œsir and vanir when Gullveigr, a female of  uncertain origin, was burned “in Hárr’s [the High (or Blind) One’s] hall,” and in Hávamál (Sayings of  Hárr) ÓDinn is said to declaim wisdom from his hall, and giants are said to have once visited him there.41 From Snorri’s Edda, there is the “master builder” tale, in which ÓDinn and the other gods unwittingly enlist a jötunn to repair ÁsgarDr’s defensive wall, which had been damaged in the first war.42 Other than these apparently primordial events, nothing much happens involving ÓDinn in his “proper locus.” Most of  the time, he is found operating in or moving through the territory of  others, whether giants, humans, or beings such as Hel, goddess of  the underworld of  the unprivileged dead. And while it is true that movement, peril, and conflict are the elements of  any good story—it was not for nothing that J. R. R. Tolkien subtitled his first novel of  Middle-earth “There and Back Again”—it is unlikely that dramatic considerations alone can account for the dominance of  themes of  dislocation in ÓDinn’s myths. The god’s character and activity are fun- damentally peripatetic. In VafÂrúDnismál (Sayings of  VafÂrúDnir) ÓDinn repeats seven times the refrain “Much have I traveled, much have I essayed, much have I tested the powers,” and his names include many that evoke long days on the road: Gangleri (Travel-Weary or Vagabond), VáfuDr (Wayfarer), Vegtamr (Way-Tamer), Gestr and Gestumblindi (Guest, Blind-Guest).43 In Gylfaginning (The deluding of  Gylfi), the main mytho- graphic section of  Snorri’s Edda, King Gylfi of  Sweden, who has come to inquire from the human œsir, or invaders from Troy, about the gods whom they worship, exclaims upon hearing a list of  ÓDinn’s names, “A great many names you have given him. And by my faith, that would require a great deal of  learning to give the details and explanations of  which events have given rise to which of  these names.”44 One of  Gylfi’s hosts confirms that “some events behind these names were performed in his journeys and 41 “fólcvíg fyrst í heimi . . . í höll Hárs” (Völuspá 21, in Edda, Neckel ed., 5; Hávamál 109, 111, 164). Here and below, I make no attempt to indicate line divisions in citations of  poetry. 42 Gylfaginning 42. 43 “FiölD ec fór, fiolD ec freistaDa, fiolD ec reynda regin” (VafÂrúDnismál 3, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, in Edda, Neckel ed., 45, 66–68). Gangleri is a name for ÓDinn given in Grímnismál 46, Vegtamr in Baldrs draumar 6, VáfuDr in Grímnismál 54 (“Wayfarer” is the translation of  this name suggested by Lee M. Hollander in his The Poetic Edda, 64, while Richard Cleasby and GuDbrandur Vigfússon suggest “Waverer” in An Icelandic–English Dictionary, 2nd ed., with a supplement by William A. Craigie [Oxford: Clarendon, 1874], 684; and Beatrice La Farge and John Tucker give “waverer” or “roamer” in their Glossary to the Poetic Edda Based on Hans Kuhn’s Kurzes Wörterbuch [Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1992], 274).

The source that best conveys the connection between these roles and of  each with ÓDinn is the eddic lay Hávamál. Punctuated by allusions to the god’s quests for knowledge, magic, and sex, much of  this poem consists of  advice on travel and hall etiquette dispensed by a wise figure, presumably though not always explicitly ÓDinn. For example, the first verse warns, “All entrances, before one goes forward, he should spy out, he should peer about; because one cannot know, where enemies sit ahead in the hall.”46 ÓDinn is qualified to give such counsel owing to his own experiences as hall guest: the plots of  several eddic poems revolve around the feasting of  ÓDinn and the gods by the (probably) giant Ægir, and the prelude to the Völsung legend narrated in several sources has ÓDinn, Loki, and Hœnir lodge with a man named HreiDmarr.47 These stories are atypical, however, in that they have ÓDinn arriving at halls openly (if  not always expectedly), sociably, and with companions. More often he travels alone, in disguise, and with covert and hostile intent. Traits of  ÓDinn that obscure his identity within the stories but which would have signaled to audiences his appearance were his hooded cloak, beard, and (though this likely never helped his disguise much) missing eye. Aside from the mere fact of  his having so many aliases, some of  his names ref- erence his propensity to travel incognito: Grímr and Grímnir (Masked, Masked One), Svipall (Changeable), Fjolnir (Concealer), SiDhöttr (Long- Hood), and (as he ironically introduces himself  on one occasion) “HárbarDr [Grey-Beard] I am called, seldom do I hide my name.”48 Perhaps the para- digmatic story of  a disguised ÓDinn on a hostile mission in VafÂrúDnismál, in which ÓDinn as GagnráDr (Against-Counsel) visits VafÂrúDnir’s hall 45 “sumir atburDir til Âessa heita hafa gerzk í ferDum hans ok er Âat fœrt í frásagnir, ok muntu eigi mega fróDr maDr heita ef  Âú skalt eigi kunna segja frá Âeim störtíDindum” (ibid.). 46 “Gáttir allar, áDr gangi fram, um scoDaz scyli, um scygnaz scyli; Âvíat óvíst er at vita, hvar óvinir sitia á fleti fyrir” (Hávamál 1, in Edda, Neckel ed., 17). Other typical lines read: “Wits are a necessity for one who roams widely”; “When a wise and silent man comes to a homestead seldom does shame befall the wary”; and “No better burden can a man carry on the road than a store of  common sense” (“Vitz er Âörf, Âeim er víDa ratar”; Âá er horscr oc Âögull kømr heimisgarDa til, sialdan verDr víti vorom”; “ByrDi betri berrat maDr brauto at, enn sé manvit mikit” [Hávamál 5, 6, 10/11, in Edda, Neckel ed., 17–18]). Translation of Hávamál 6 and 10/11 from Larrington, The Poetic Edda, 15. 47 Lokasenna is set at a feast in Ægir’s hall over which ÓDinn, though a guest, presides, while HymskviDa centers around Êórr’s efforts to procure a cauldron capable of  brewing the drink for this feast; Ægir’s feast for the œsir is also mentioned in Skáldskaparmál 33. The visit of  ÓDinn, Hœnir, and Loki to HreiDmarr is narrated in Völsunga saga 14 (for edition and translation, see Völsunga saga: The Saga of the Volsungs; the Icelandic Text according to MS Nks 1824 b, 4o, ed. and trans.

Now I’ve bandied my word-wisdom against ÓDinn; you will always be the wisest.”50 That ÓDinn waits until he has delivered the knowledge contest’s coup de grâce to reveal his identity underscores the tactical nature of  his undertaking: his disguise permits him entry into space controlled by another and gives him the time needed to maneuver into a position of  strength. The elements of  antagonism and danger present in ÓDinn’s visit to VafÂrúDnir are more pronounced in other tales of  his journeys, in which, rather than “traveler” and “hall guest,” ÓDinn plays the more sinister roles of  “exile” and “hostage.” The theme of  exile comes forth most starkly in Saxo. In book 1 of  his history, Saxo writes that ÓDinn “was believed throughout Europe, though falsely, to be a god. He had the habit of staying more frequently than anywhere at Uppsala.”51 Northern kings made a golden effigy of  ÓDinn and sent it to him, only to have his wife Frigg seduce a craftsman into melting and recasting the statue as orna- ments. “Stung by this double embarrassment,” ÓDinn “took to exile replete with an honest shame, thinking he would thereby obliterate the stain of  his disgrace.”52 ÓDinn returned to power, but in book 3 of  the Gesta Danorum he is made to undergo a second, less voluntary exile. After he employed a series of  disguises and ruses to rape the princess Rinda and conceive on her Bo, the fated avenger of  his son Baldr, the other “gods, whose prin- cipal residence was reckoned to be at Byzantium, perceived that Odin had tarnished the honour of  his divinity by these various lapses from dignity and . . . ensured that he was ousted from his preeminence, stripped of  his personal titles and worship, and outlawed.”53 After a decade or so, “the 49 “forvitni micla qveD ec mér á fornom stöfom viD Âann inn alsvinna iotun” (VafÂrúD- nismál 1, in Edda, Neckel ed., 45). Translation from Larrington, The Poetic Edda, 40. 50 “hvat mælti ÓDinn, áDr á bál stigi, siálfr í eyra syni?”; “Ey manni Âat veit, hvat Âú í árdaga sagDir í eyra syni. . . . Nú ec viD ÓDin deildac mína orDspeki, Êú ert æ vísaster vera” (VafÂrúDnismál 54, 55, in Edda, Neckel ed., 55). 51 “Ea tempestate cum Othinus quidam Europa tota falso diuinitatis titulo censeretur, apud Vpsalam tamen crebriorem diuersandi usum habebat”; Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum 1, in Holder ed., 25. Translation from The History of the Danes, trans.

Reckoning that he had com- pleted a severe enough sentence they restored him from filthy rags to his former splendour. . . . There were some, however, who believed he did not deserve permission to be reinstated in his rank because, through adopting actors’ tricks and women’s duties, he had brought the foulest of  slurs on their reputation.”54 While it is tempting to dismiss much of  Saxo’s char- acterization as so much Christian condemnation of  a discredited pagan deity, the substance if  not all of  the detail of  what he describes is con- firmed by other and older sources, and scholars generally consider the tradition of  ÓDinn’s exile(s) early.55 There are two occasions when ÓDinn is taken hostage by a host. The first is in the frame narrative of  the eddic poem Grímnismál (Sayings of Grímnir), in which ÓDinn visits the court of  GeirrøDr to settle a dispute between himself  and Frigg over the king’s purported lack of  hospitality.56 When ÓDinn arrives calling himself Grímnir, GeirrøDr, who had been 54 “tandem Othinus, diis atrocitatem exilii miserantibus, satis iam graues penas dedisse uisus, squaloris deformitatem pristino fulgoris habitu permutauit. . . . Extitere tamen, qui ipsum recuperande dignitais aditu indignum censerent, quod scenicis artibus et muliebris officii suscepcione teterrimum diui nominis opprobrium edidisset”; Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum 3, in Holder ed., 81. Translation from The History of the Danes, trans. Fisher, 1:78. 55 See n. 43 of  Davidson’s commentary to Saxo Grammaticus, The History of the Danes, 2:32. In Heimskringla, Snorri, also writing in a historical vein, describes a similar period of absence for ÓDinn: “ÓDinn had two brothers. One was named Vé and the other Vili. Those brothers of  his ruled the kingdom when he was away. It happened one time, when ÓDinn had gone far away and tarried a long while, that his return seemed to the œsir past hope. Then his brothers took to dividing his inheritance, but his wife Frigg they both took possession of. A little later ÓDinn came home. He then took back his wife” (“ÓDinn átti tvá brœDr. Hét annarr Vé, en annarr Vílir. Êeir brœDr hans styrDu ríkinu, Âá er hann var í brottu. Êat var eitt sinn, Âá er ÓDinn var farinn langt í brot ok hafDi lengi dvalzk, at Ásum pótti ørvænt hans heim. Êá tóku brœDr hans at skipta arfi hans, en konu hans, Frigg, gengu Âeir báDir at eiga. En litlu síDar kom ÓDinn heim. Tók hann Âá viD konu sinni” [Snorri Sturluson, Ynglinga saga 3, in Heim- skringla, Bjarni ADalbjarnarson ed., 1:12]). That ÓDinn’s wife slept with his brothers is also attested in Lokasenna, where Loki proclaims: “Shut up, Frigg! . . . you have always been man- crazy, when, ViDrir’s [ÓDinn’s] wife, you allowed both Vé and Vili into your embrace” (“Êegi Âú, Frigg! . . . hefir æ vergiorn veriD er Âá Véa oc Vilia léztu Âér, ViDris qvæn, báDa í baDm um tekit” [Lokasenna 26, in Edda, Neckel ed., 101]). There is also a perhaps related tradition about the goddess Freyja, who, to quote Gylfaginning, was married to that man who is named ÓDr. . . . ÓDr went away to long distances. . . . Freyja has many names, and that is because she gave herself  various names when she went among unknown peoples to look for ÓDr” (“Hon giptisk Âeim manni er ÓDr heitir. . . . ÓDr fór í braut langar leiDir. . . . Freyja á mörg nöfn, en sú er sök til Âess at hon gaf  sér ymis heiti er hon fór meD ókunnum ÂjóDum at leita ÓDs” [Snorri Sturluson, Gylfaginning 35, in Faulkes ed., 29]). Though a shadowy fig- ure, ÓDr is probably to be identified with ÓDinn (see de Vries, “Contributions to the Study of Othin,” 33–39, and Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, 2:87–88). Finally, it is worth noting that not just ÓDinn but certain of  his royal offspring suffer periods of  exile and outlawry: for example, in the first chapter of  Völsunga saga, ÓDinn’s son Siggi kills a thrall and is declared an úlfr, a “wolf ” or “outlaw.” 56 In the case of  this and other eddic poems, references to prose introductions or interludes refer to text appearing in the Codex Regius (see n. 15 above). </page> <page sequence="17"> 332 God on the Margins warned to beware a treacherous visitor, has “him tortured to make him speak and set him between two fires, and he sat there eight nights.”57 In part a meditation on how not to treat a guest, in part an excuse for ÓDinn to recite cosmological and mythological names useful for constructing kennings, or circumlocutions employed in skaldic verse, the poem ends when GeirrøDor, finally recognizing his hostage, leaps up to free him, trips, and is impaled on his own sword. The second instance of  ÓDinn as captive occurs in the several sources that describe his visit to HreiDmarr.58 It is told that before ÓDinn and his companions come to HreiDmarr’s house, Loki killed an otter, which the œsir offer to share as a meal with their host. Un- fortunately, the otter was really Otr, son of  HreiDmarr, and so the aggrieved host and his remaining sons take the gods captive, threatening to kill them if  they fail to fill up as well as cover entirely their slain kinsman’s pelt with gold. What is perhaps most striking about tales of  ÓDinn’s captivity is that, as in the case of  his contest against VafÂrúDnir, there is never any sense that the peril he faces is less than real. He seems truly to be at the mercy of  his captors/hosts, and his life (or at least well-being, if  one takes his foreknown date with the Fenrisúlfr at ragnarök seriously) seems genuinely to be at stake. And yet ÓDinn is a god—and not just any áss, but the head deity as well as chief  architect of  the cosmos—while those threatening him are giants or humans, beings who by most measures ought to be regarded as his inferiors. ÓDinn’s disadvantages, however, seem to have less to do with an objective ranking of  his and his opponents’ powers than with the fact that he is operating tactically, on, that is, someone else’s turf.59 Though a god, ÓDinn is rarely in a position to accomplish or attain anything by fiat. Rather, he relies on practices that “are tactical in character . . . vic- tories of  the ‘weak’ over the ‘strong’ (whether the strength be that of powerful people or the violence of  things or of  an imposed order, etc.), clever tricks, knowing how to get away with things . . . maneuvers, poly- morphic simulations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike.”60 While Norse myth was unlikely to have been on de Certeau’s mind when he wrote these words, they nonetheless aptly summarize ÓDinn’s modus operandi. 57 “Konungr lét hann pína til sagna oc setia milli elda tveggia, oc sat hann Âar átta nætr” (Edda, Neckel ed., 57). Translation from Larrington, The Poetic Edda, 51. 58 See n. 47 above. 59 Interestingly, however, the balance does not shift much in ÓDinn’s favor even when he is at home. On several occasions, as when Loki crashes the feast of  the gods ÓDinn is helping to host at Ægir’s (see n. 47 above), or when jötnar such as the master builder or Hrungnir in- filtrate ÁsgarDr (Gylfaginning 42 and Skáldskaparmál 17), ÓDinn is compelled by the con- straints of  hospitality to put up with unwelcome and disruptive guests. In each of  these cases, it is left up to Êórr, with his seeming freedom from or utter lack of  concern for social nice- ties, to expel or eliminate the intruder. 60 de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life, xix. </page> <page sequence="18"> History of Religions 333 ÓDinn is not, like the Christian god, a deity who makes one excursion from his heavenly sphere to place himself  willingly at the mercy of  his creatures to obtain a foreseen, certain, and absolute victory; on the contrary, he is a vagrant god operating time and again on and from the margins, making the best tactical use of  the situations that arise, and fighting a reactionary battle against eventual but certain defeat. There is nothing “transcendent” about him. myths of transience ÓDinn’s myths express the motif  of  transience and ephemerality mainly through their preoccupation with the god’s own. If  there is a thematic thread running through the tales of  ÓDinn, it is his struggle to counteract fate, both his own and that of  the world he set in order. Norse religion is not alone, of  course, in its having an eschaton. What sets it apart from many others, however, is its comprehensiveness: as the Norse apocalypse’s name in either of  its forms suggests, when the day of  reckoning arrives, divine beings and realms will prove just as finite as human ones.61 From informants he encounters or summons, ÓDinn learns that it will be his fate at ragnarök to fall in battle against Loki’s offspring the Fenrisúlfr (the wolf Fenrir). While the sources agree that a new world will emerge from the cosmic conflagration that consumes the old—though whether this rebirth is of  genuine pagan origin or to be attributed to Christian influence has been the subject of  perennial debate—none indicates that ÓDinn has any place in it.62 The theme of  northern “fatalism,” evident not just in the mythology but in legendary materials such as Beowulf  and versions of  the Völsung/ Nibelungen cycle, has been often discussed by scholars. Indeed, as Paul C. Bauschatz describes, it is “almost a cliché to refer to early Germanic 61 On the forms of  this name, see n. 27 above. 62 The most important sources for Norse cosmic history are Völuspá, in which a völva or female spirit is summoned by ÓDinn to tell him of  the beginning and end of  things; VafÂrúD- nismál, in which ÓDinn quizzes VafÂrúDnir on this same topic; and Gylfaginning, which supplies a prose synopsis of  information culled from both poems, here narrated by the human œsir from Troy to King Gylfi. Major studies of  ragnarök include Axel Olrik, Om Ragnarok (Copenhagen: G. C. Gad, 1914); John Stanley Martin, Ragnarök: An Investigation into Old Norse Concepts of the Fate of the Gods (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1972); and John McKinnell, Both One and Many: Essays on Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism (Rome: Il Calamo, 1994). The survivors of  ragnarök differ between Völuspá and VafÂrúDnismál. In the former, Baldr and his slayer HöDr, both sons of  ÓDinn, are reborn, and Hœnir is mentioned as present; there is also a reference to the coming of  “a powerful, strong one” (“inn ríki . . . öflugr” [Völuspá 65, in Edda, Neckel ed., 15]) in a half-stanza that has been the subject of much controversy (Ursula Dronke, for example, omits it from her edition of  the poem on the grounds that it is almost certainly a later, patently Christian interpolation; see Ursula Dronke, ed. and trans., The Poetic Edda, vol. 2: Mythological Poems [Oxford: Clarendon, 1997], 152–53). In the latter, ÓDinn’s sons ViDarr and Váli and Êorr’s sons Magni and MóDi survive, along with two humans, Líf  and LífÂrasir. </page> <page sequence="19"> 334 God on the Margins people as gloomy, humorless, and fatalistic,” and most have come to regard their mythos as one in which nothing is able to “transcend the tyranny of the insubstantial. . . . This lack of  eternality is, from a Christian point of  view, ‘gloomy’—it is peculiarly un-Christian to conceive of  heaven as not permanent.”63 Such a worldview is also, of  course, distinctly un- Platonic. As Augustine of  Hippo, history’s foremost Neoplatonic Chris- tian spokesman, writes of  God in his Confessions: “In you are the constant causes of  inconstant things. All mutable things have in you their immutable origins. In you all irrational and temporal things have the everlasting causes of  their life.”64 From the perspective of  the Greek Academy or Christian theology the notion of  impermanent divinity is not just troubling or gloomy, but incoherent—the ever-shifting world of  experience simply must be grounded in an unvarying realm of  abstract being. Otherwise, as Plato in- sists, one is left with the possibility of  opinion but never of  knowledge.65 While of  the theorists discussed at the outset of  the article, Eliade alone appears to share Plato’s ontological and epistemological suppositions, all seem to agree that these are distinctive of  religious worldviews in general. As Lincoln writes in the third of  his “Theses on Method,” it ought to be the job of  the historian of  religions to discuss “the temporal, contextual, situated, interested, human, and material dimensions of  those discourses, practices, and institutions that characteristically represent themselves as eternal, transcendent, spiritual, and divine.”66 But if  it is indeed religion’s aim to legitimize human and historical orders by anchoring these in divine and cosmic orders, then what are we to make of  a religious system in which the latter are as subject to instability and impermanence as the former? While distressing from a Platonic/Christian standpoint, the German sense of  doom and gloom has not always been viewed negatively; indeed, for many romantics and nationalists it has proved a point of  perverse, even Promethean, pride. Condemnation and celebration aside, a number of  explanations for this fatalism have been proposed. These range from seeing in it a reflection of  the oppressive northern clime and attendant dread of  nature, to a meditation on the tendency for feud to spiral out of control in a society bereft of  effective executive powers, to a “real world” 63 Paul C. Bauschatz, The Well and the Tree: World and Time in Early Germanic Culture (Amherst: University of  Massachusetts Press, 1982), xi. 64 “et apud te rerum omnium instabilium stant causae et rerum omnium mutabilium in- mutabiles manent origines et omnium inrationalium et temporalium sempiternae vivunt rationes” (bk. 1, chap. 6, in Augustinus Confessiones, ed.

First, however, to establish that ÓDinn’s mythos is characterized by motifs not only of  spatial or social but also of  temporal marginality, I will describe in this section the extent to which his character and stories are marked by the themes of  death, fate, and sacrifice. As mentioned, two of ÓDinn’s main activities are his questing for knowledge and his gathering of  dead nobles and warriors in Valhöll. Both form part of  the god’s prep- arations for ragnarök and thus are tied to the motif  of  impermanence. As to the first activity, though the connection is not always explicit, ÓDinn’s gathering of  knowledge is usually interpreted as an effort to forestall the apocalypse or mitigate its effects.68 Among his information-gathering tools are HlíDskjálf  and the ravens Huginn and Muninn (Thought and Memory) that he sends out each day to collect intelligence about happenings in the worlds.69 Above all, ÓDinn seeks wisdom from the dead, whose access to the past grants them certain knowledge of  the nonpast or future.70 What- ever one makes of  attempts to link giants to the dead, certain of  ÓDinn’s 67 The first possibility is suggested in McKinnell, Both One and Many, 38. The second is presented in John Lindow, Murder and Vengeance among the Gods: Baldr in Scandinavian Mythology (Helsinki: Soumalainen tiedeakatemia, 1997). The third thesis has most often been applied to the outlook of  the composer of  Völuspá, a poem in which the balance of  pagan and Christian elements has been a matter of  long debate (see Ursula Dronke, “Pagan Beliefs and Christian Impact: The Contribution of  Eddic Studies,” in Viking Revaluations: Viking Society Centenary Symposium, ed. Anthony Faulkes and Richard Perkins [London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 1993], 121–27, and The Poetic Edda, Volume II: Mythological Poems, 93–98). 68 See, e.g., Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes, 1:219–28; de Vries, Altgermanische Re- ligionsgeschichte, 2:66–75; Haugen, “The Edda as Ritual,” 13–15; and Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North, 35–50. 69 See Grímnismál 20 and Gylfaginning 38. 70 Bauschatz argues for a binary temporal system among pre-Christian Germans, in which time is not divided into past-present-future, but past versus nonpast: “The past, as collector of  events, is clearly the most dominant, controlling portion of  all time. . . . The past is ex- perienced, known, laid down, accomplished, sure, realized. The present, to the contrary, is in flux and confusion. . . . What we nowadays call the ‘future’ is, within the structure of  this Germanic system, just more of  the nonpast, more flux, more confusion” (The Well and the Tree, 139). While I do not agree with Clunies-Ross’s full-scale rejection (Prolonged Echoes, 1:238) of  Bauschatz’s theory of  “Germanic” time, insofar as I find Bauschatz’s discussions about the determining power of  the past upon the “nonpast” useful, it seems unwarranted to jettison the idea of  the future entirely when considering Norse myth, given that ÓDinn is depicted in a number of  sources trying to forestall events that he knows will occur but have yet to begin. Among the dead whom ÓDinn consults are the völur (sing. völva) or female spirits whom he raises in Völuspá and Baldrs draumar, the detached head of  the wise Mímir (see Ynglinga saga 7), and hanged men (he is called HangaguD in Gylfaginning 20 and Hangatyr in Skáldskaparmál 1 and 2, both meaning “God of  the Hanged”). </page> <page sequence="21"> 336 God on the Margins journeys into Jötunheimar are also clearly aimed at gaining knowledge or the means to preserve and transmit it.71 Finally, ÓDinn himself  undergoes self-sacrifice and perhaps even death to attain wisdom: in Hávamál, his hanging and perhaps dying on the ash Yggdrasill allow him to take up and possess the sacred runes, and the motif  of  the god’s blindness is linked to his having deposited one of  his eyes in a well—itself  probably symbolic of  the past—at the foot of  the tree in return for prophetic insight.72 As to the second activity, while the sources do not all agree in making ÓDinn exclusively the host of  those fallen in battle, descriptions of  Valhöll stress this idea, and there is nearly always a class dimension to his involve- ment with the dead.73 Kennings for battle or the war dead that employ ÓDinn’s names are ubiquitous in skaldic poetry, and there is a subgenre of  court panegyric that trumpets the arrival of  slain kings in Valhöll.74 The god’s reception of  dead warriors is frequently described in terms of  sac- rifice. The sagas present accounts of  kings and war leaders who dedicate those they intend to slay to ÓDinn, often by casting a spear over an opposing force, an act that mimics that of  the god in the war between the œsir and vanir.75 In so doing, a warrior ensured that, win or lose, he would make a proper sacrifice to his deity. There are also instances where kings or important men are offered up more directly to ÓDinn. The most well- known account of  a royal sacrifice is in Gautreks saga, a relatively late fornaldarsaga. In it, the warrior-poet StarkaDr is a favorite companion of the successful Viking king Víkarr. Returning from an expedition, the king and his men “suffered a great head wind. They turned to prophecy to get a fair wind, and it so fell out that ÓDinn wanted to receive a man by 71 VafÂrúDnismál has been interpreted as a fact-finding mission regarding ragnarök, and Hávamál 104–10 and Skáldskaparmál G57 describe ÓDinn’s procurement from the jötunn Suttungr of  a magical mead, “whoever drinks from which becomes a poet or scholar” (“hverr er af  drekkr verDr skáld eDa frœDamaDr” [Faulkes ed., 3]; translation from Snorri Sturluson, Edda, trans. Faulkes, 62). 72 Hávamál 138–41; on ÓDinn’s forefeiture of  his eye, see Völuspá 28 and Gylfaginning 15. 73 In HárbarDsljóD (Song of  HárbarDr), a poem in which Êórr and a disguised ÓDinn trade insults over a river, the latter declares that “ÓDinn has the earls, those who fall in battle, and Êórr has the race of  thralls” (“ÓDinn á iarla, Âá er í val falla, enn Êórr á Âræla kyn” [Hár- barDsljóD 24, in Edda, Neckel ed., 82]), while in Grímnismál it is reported of  the goddess Freyja that “she chooses half  the slain each day, and ÓDinn has half ” (“hálfan val hon kyss hverian dag, enn hálfan ÓDinn á” [Grímnismál 14, in Edda, Neckel ed., 60]). On exceptions to Valhöll’s door policy, see de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, 2:377–78. 74 For example, we read in Eyvindr Finnsson’s Hákonarmál that “Gautatyr [ÓDinn] sent Göndull and Skögull to choose among kings, who of  Yngvi’s kindred [royalty] should with ÓDinn fare and in Valhöll dwell” (“Göndul ok Skögul sendi Gautatyr at kjósa um konunga, hverr Yngva ættar skyldi meD ÓDni fara ok í Valhöll at vesa” [Eyvindr Finnsson, Hákonarmál 1, in Anglo-Saxon and Norse Poems, ed. and trans. N. Kershaw (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1922), 104]). 75 See Chadwick, The Cult of Othin, 7–8, for a list of  sources in which a spear is cast over an enemy host. For ÓDinn’s doing so over the vanir, see Völuspá 24. </page> <page sequence="22"> History of Religions 337 hanging, chosen by lot from the army. . . . King Víkarr’s lot came up.”76 The king and his men decided to hold a mock hanging and stabbing to appease (or fool) ÓDinn. StarkaDr, however, is instructed by his foster father Hrosshársgrani, who has been revealed to him to be ÓDinn in disguise, on how to make the sacrifice real, and the king ends up being killed by calf ’s guts that transform into a noose and a reed that becomes a spear during the crucial moment in the ceremony. Such betrayal by ÓDinn of  a former favorite is far from singular. While at times such epi- sodes are accompanied, as scholars’ emphases on moral appraisal might lead us to expect, by condemnation of  the god’s actions or motivation,77 just as often no negative judgment is made; instead, the turnabout in fortune is accepted or even justified. In Völsunga saga, for instance, ÓDinn appears in the midst of  a battle being fought by his own scion Sig- mundr and uses his spear to break Gramr, the sword that he had earlier given to the king. As he lies dying, Sigmundr laconically states: “Odin no longer wants me to wield a sword. . . . I fought battles as long as he wanted me to.”78 Berger has suggested that a central function of  religion is its “integra- tion into a comprehensive nomos of  precisely those marginal situations in which the reality of  everyday life is put in question. . . . [It] maintains 76 “fekk andviDri mikit. Êeir felldu spán til byrjar, ok fell svó at ÓDinn villdi Âiggja mann at hlutfalli at hanga ór hernum . . . kom upp hlutr Víkars konungs” (Gautrekssaga 7, in Ranisch ed., 28). 77 For example, in what is likely one of  the older eddic lays, the warrior Dagr declares apropos the internecine strife in which he is embroiled, “ÓDinn alone causes all evil, because he bore runes of  strife between kinsmen” (“einn veldr ÓDinn öllo bölvi, Âvíat meD sifiungom sacrúnar bar” [HelgakviDa Hundingsbana önnur 34, in Edda, Neckel ed., 158]); in Lokasenna, Loki says to ÓDinn that “often you gave, that which you should not give, victory to the less worthy” (“opt Âú gaft, Âeim er Âú gefa scyldira, inom slævorom, sigr” [Lokasenna 22, in Edda, Neckel ed., 101]), and ÓDinn in replying does not disagree; and in the tenth-century skaldic encomium Eiríksmál, when rumor of  King Eiríkr blóDøx’s death reaches Valhöll one among the einherjar asks ÓDinn, “Why did you deprive him of  victory when he seemed to you to be brave?” (“Hví namt Âu hann sigri Âá er Âér Âótti hann snjallr vera?” [Eiríksmál 6, in Anglo- Saxon and Norse Poems, Kershaw ed., 96]). 78 “Vill ÓDinn ekki at vér bregDum sverDi síDan. . . . Hefi ek haft orrostur meDan honum líkaDi” (translation and text [spelling, capitalization, and punctuation normalized] from Völ- sunga saga, Grimstad ed., 118–19). As another example, in Eiríksmál, while some among the einherjar are upset that ÓDinn has betrayed such an illustrious king, they seem to accept his explanation that he has done so because the time of  ragnarök “cannot be known . . . the grey wolf  peers at the gods’ abode,” and the poem ends on a triumphant note: “ ‘Hail to you, Eiríkr,’ said Sigmundr, ‘You shall be welcome here! . . . Which warriors follow you from battle? ‘There are five kings,’ said Eiríkr . . . ‘I am myself  the sixth’ ” (“ ‘Âví at óvíst er at vita,’ sagDe ÓDenn, ‘sér ulfr enn hösve á sjöt goDa.’ ‘Hæill Âú nú Æiríkr,’ kvaD Sigmundr, ‘væl scalt Âú hér kominn! . . . hvat fylgir Âér jöfra frá eggÂrymu?’ ‘Konongar eru v,’ sagÂi Eiríkr . . . ‘ec em hinn sétti sjalfr’ ” [Eiríksmál 6–8, in Anglo-Saxon and Norse Poems, Kershaw ed., 96, 98]). A similar happy ending is found in HelgakviDa Hundingsbana önnur, in which Helgi, the kinsman slain by Dagr, is made ÓDinn’s virtual coregent in the warrior’s afterlife (HelgakviDa Hundingsbana önnur 39 and preceding prose interlude, in Edda, Neckel ed., 158–59). </page> <page sequence="23"> 338 God on the Margins the socially defined reality by legitimating marginal situations in terms of an all-encompassing sacred reality.”79 Applying this insight, it might be argued that ÓDinn’s function as god of  war and death was primarily the- odical, insofar as his feasting of  slain warriors until world’s end recon- ciled those facing the prospect or reality of  defeat and violent death to their fate. Thus, while ÓDinn’s decision that an illustrious warrior should die in battle could on one level be seen as a stab in the back, it was also a flattering and even necessary determination. As long as a king or hero won battles and killed others, he served ÓDinn’s purpose by swelling the ranks of  the einherjar; eventually, however, if  he were really any good, the god would wish to add him to their number. Rather, therefore, than soft-pedal what to many observers have seemed the perfidious acts of an im- or amoral god, the sources tend to be direct and unapologetic in describing this dimension of  his character. As Snorri perhaps sums it up best in describing the relationship of  ÓDinn and kings in Ynglinga saga: “to some he gave victory, and some he summoned to himself. Either choice seemed good.”80 In considering, moreover, this theme in light of  ÓDinn’s more general associations with death and sacrifice, moral questions seem largely beside the point. The myths in which ÓDinn turns his back on storied warriors—while simultaneously, of  course, welcoming them into his company—appear in their wider context less meditations on the cost of  shattered loyalties or the unreliability of  an inferior god (though they may be these in part) than reflections on the fleeting nature of  power and all ordered systems. They are one more way in which ÓDinn symbolizes transience. óDinn, poets, and kings In this last section, I return to the two questions posed at the outset of my account of  major motifs in the myths of  ÓDinn. To rephrase the first slightly: if  ÓDinn was, arguably, Norse religion’s central figure and, more certainly, god of  the late pagan political and cultural elite, why does he so often in myths produced and consumed by this elite occupy or operate from marginal positions? Second, how might or ought the transient quality of the Norse cosmos and its principal guardian modify the conviction that a major function of  religion as cultural practice is to supply an eternal and transcendent—in short, unassailable—foundation for ephemeral and human institutions and values? While, to repeat an earlier point, these questions are framed in such a way that the first is of  most use for attain- ing insight into the construction and reception of  ÓDinn’s mythos within its 79 Berger, The Sacred Canopy, 42, 44. 80 “Gaf  hann Âá sumum sigr, en sumum bauD hann til sín. Êótti hvárrtveggi kostr góDr” (Snorri Sturluson, Ynglinga saga 9, in Heimskringla, Bjarni ADalbjarnarson ed., 1:22). </page> <page sequence="24"> History of Religions 339 medieval Scandinavian context and the second for assessing arguments about the claims of  religious orders to objectivity and permanence, they are not unrelated. Above all, determining whether, for whom, and why ÓDinn’s myths held meaning is a necessary preliminary to assessing their relevance to a consideration of  general definitions and functions of  religion. Further- more, while the former question applies mainly to motifs of  dislocation and thus theory about religious conceptions of  space and the latter to motifs of  transience and thus theory about religious conceptions of  time, the issues they address are not easily separable. For whether one is speaking of  space and centers or of  time and eternity, the essence of  the standard claim re- mains that religions provide anchors to the absolute. As Eliade puts it in a phrase to which none of  our scholars would likely object, religion provides for “the legitimization of  human acts through an extrahuman model.”81 The problem that remains, however, is just what sort of  model this is or has to be. Before addressing these questions, it must be admitted that in studying Norse materials we are dealing with a “mythology” in only a very restricted sense. While in any attempt to describe a religion or one of  its dimensions there is the risk, to quote Lincoln, that we will “mistake the ideological positions favoured and propagated by the dominant fraction for those of the group as a whole,” the perspective we have on Norse paganism may be more limited than usual.82 In this case, we do not have anything like a comprehensive data set providing insight into beliefs and values at all levels of  a culture, but rather the partially fossilized remains of  a tradition as it was envisaged and recorded by a narrow and elect fragment in an era of  social and religious transition. What we have, in essence, is a poet’s- eye view of  Norse myth, whether accessible directly in the work of  eddic and skaldic composers or at one remove, as in the poetics of  Snorri or the sagas and histories that rely heavily and often explicitly on verse tra- ditions.83 Or, to consider the problem from the side of  the consumer, the vast majority of  these works we know to have been produced for royal, noble, or other elite patrons. Rather than argue, then, that this material somehow represents the common ideology or ethos of  the Norse “people,” I will limit myself  in what follows to suggesting ways in which the ÓDinnic motifs described above reflect the social situation, outlook, and interests of poets, their patrons, and those who later preserved and adapted their work. Whether this lessens or vitiates this material’s potential for contributing 81 Eliade, Myth of the Eternal Return, 27. 82 Lincoln, “Theses on Method,” 226. 83 It is doubtful whether any meaningful social distinction can be drawn between eddic and skaldic composers.

It has often been assumed that elite members of  a society, in addition to favoring conservative ideologies that help to preserve the status quo, will value and promote symbolism of  the center. As Smith explains, how- ever, this assumption holds only for certain kinds of  elites: A locative map of  the world . . . guarantees meaning and value through structures of  congruity and conformity. Students of  religion have been most successful in describing and interpreting this locative, imperial map. . . . Yet, the very success of  these topographies should be a signal for caution. For they are largely based on documents from urban, agricultural, hierarchical cultures. The most persuasive witnesses to a locative, imperial world-view are the production of  well organized, self-conscious scribal elites who had a deep vested interest in restricting mobility and valuing place. . . . In most cases one cannot escape the suspicion that, in the locative map of  the world, we are encountering a self-serving ideology which ought not to be generalized into the universal pattern of  religious experience and expression.84 Once one has gotten past the presumption of  a universal conjunction between locative maps and social elites (let alone the notion that all people everywhere privilege the center), the way is open to see how the myths of  ÓDinn, with their radical and often overdetermined symbolism of  marginality, reflect or express the social realities and interests of  their major producers and consumers. For insofar as they fulfilled their norma- tive roles, poets and kings were, like their god, perpetual travelers and guests. As for poets, known skalds were after 900 almost exclusively Ice- landers.85 Iceland was intensively settled from 870 to 930 largely by Norwegians who, according to Iceland’s earliest historians, rejected and fled the centralization of  royal authority being pursued by King Haraldr hárfagri (Fairhair).86 It remained a land with neither king nor court until 84 Smith, Map Is Not Territory, 292–93. 85 For discussion of  Icelanders’ virtual monopolization of  skaldic court poetry from this date, see, among others, Faulkes’s introduction to his Edda translation, xii–xiii; Roberta Frank, Old Norse Court Poetry: The Dröttkvœtt Stanza (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1978), 23; Hans Kuhn, Das Dróttkvœtt (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1983), 284–85; E. O. G.

While there may have been possibilities during these centuries for Icelandic poets to ply their craft at the farmsteads of  goDar (sing. goDi ), or chieftains, at home, those who aspired to the position of  hirDskáld, or court poet, had little choice but to travel to Norway, Denmark, or Sweden and seek out patrons among an ever-shifting network of  kings and nobles. Such am- bition is so common in the sagas that John Lindow has coined the term “poet’s travel pattern” to refer to tales in which an Icelandic protagonist “relies on verbal skill to obtain, maintain, or regain a favoured position with the monarch,” and there can be little doubt that the sources in this case reflected social realities.87 The poet was not the only roving partner in this exchange, however. The first thing an aspiring hirDskáld newly arrived on the shores of  the Scandinavian mainland, or sometimes the British Isles, had to ascertain where a king and his hirD were currently at. Snorri’s Óláfs saga helga (Saint Óláfr’s saga) describes how two skalds, a father and son, entered into the service of  King Óláfr Haraldsson at different times and places: ÊórDr Sigvaldaskáld was the name of  an Icelandic man. He had for a long time been with Earl Sigvaldi and later with Êorkell the Tall. . . . He met Óláfr when the king was raiding in the west and became his man, and followed him after- wards. . . . Sigvatr was ÊórDr’s son. . . . When he was nearly a grown man he went abroad with merchants and came by ship in the fall to Trondheim. . . . That same winter King Óláfr came to Trondheim. . . . And when Sigvatr heard that his father ÊórDr was there with the king, then Sigvatr went to the king, met his father ÊórDr and stayed there a while.88 More than two centuries later, Snorri, himself  an aspiring court poet, was in a situation similar to that of  the skalds of  his saga. During a two-year visit to Norway in 1218–20, he and his desired patrons King Hákon 87 John Lindow, “Skald Sagas in Their Literary Context 1: Related Icelandic Genres,” in Skaldsagas: Text, Vocation, and Desire in the Icelandic Sagas of Poets, ed.

The Franks, to take a notable example, only established a royal city in Aachen under Charlemagne, who mimicked in this not his ancestors but the Roman rulers he was poised to replace in the west: his capital was thus more of  an imperial than a royal affectation.90 As Birgit and Peter Sawyer describe, this rootlessness of  Germanic kings and their followings persisted for some time in Scandinavia: “Even in the early Middle Ages kings were not solely dependent on the land they owned. They could claim hospitality for themselves, their retinues, and perhaps even their agents. . . . This right . . . was so abused that in the late thirteenth century attempts were made in all three kingdoms to regulate it. The general obligation to contribute food and materials needed by the royal household as it traveled from place to place was, in effect, one of the earliest taxes.”91 Snorri describes Óláfr Haraldsson making such rounds in the early eleventh century: [Óláfr] sent other men to Uppland with that message to prepare entertainment [boDa veizlur; veizla here refers to the legal obligation to provide hospitality for a king and his retinue] for himself, and that he intended that winter to make the rounds [fara at veizlum] of  Uppland because that had been a custom of  the earlier kings to make the rounds of  Uppland every third winter. He began the journey in the fall from Borg. The king went first to Vingulmörk. He arranged the journey such that he received hospitality [taka veizlur] up in the neighborhood of  the forest districts and he summoned to himself  all of  the inhabitants.92 89 These movements are reported in Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar 53 and 59, in Sturla ÊórDarson, Hákonar Saga and a Fragment of Magnús Saga with Appendices, ed.

For more on the practice </page> <page sequence="28"> History of Religions 343 Evidence for the perdurance of  perambulatory kingship in Scandinavia in the Middle Ages is archaeological as well as literary. Stefan Brink sum- marizes recent assessments of  northern political and social structures in and prior to the medieval period based upon excavations of  royal banquet halls situated in so-called “central place complexes”: In the political system that can be discerned in Viking-Age Scandinavia, power seems to have been exercised through the itineration of  a political leader (king, chieftain, deputy, etc.) between different centres of  power, where political, legal and maybe religious matters were dealt with. This has been called an ambulatory or itinerant kingship. . . . This itinerant exercise of  power in the prehistoric and early medieval Scandinavian societies had as a consequence that the king never had any permanent control over the whole realm at the same time. The autonomy of  the different provinces and settlement districts was remarkably strong . . . during the whole of  the Middle Ages.93 Further, Brink states that while it has proven “possible to find the (main) sites for both a superior king and for petty-kings and chieftains of  the Late Iron Age in especially eastern Scandinavia . . . these individuals probably never were geographically static. What we find are probably the sites of the hall-buildings of  these leaders,” all of  which “were most certainly never actually lived in.”94 So long as kings presided over and poets sought entry into circum- ambulatory courts that for their settings and very materialization relied upon the labor and hospitality of  others, and which were integral to main- taining authority in a political system that was decentralized, diffuse, and and conventions governing royal processions in all of  the Scandinavian kingdoms as well as of  chieftains in Iceland, see the entry for “Gästning” in Kulturhistorisk leksikon for nordisk middelalder fra vikingetid til reformationstid (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde og Bagger, 1961), 6:2–19. 93 Stefan Brink, “Political and Social Structures in Early Scandinavia: A Settlement- Historical Pre-study of  the Central Place,” Tor 28 (1996): 239–40. 94 Stefan Brink, “Social Order in the Early Scandinavian Landscape,” in Settlement and Landscape: Proceedings of a Conference in Århus, Denmark, May 4–7 1998, ed.

Brink also supplies a good ex- ample of  literary testimony to continued attention to the infrastructure for itinerant kingship into the mid-1200s from a near-contemporary report of  the reign of  Hákon Hákonarson (r. 1217–63): “hann let gera trehallina i konungsgardi i Nidarosi (he made the wooden hall at the royal estate in Nidaros), hann let gera veizluhall aa Steig (he made a banqueting-hall in Steig), hann let gera bu aa Hofi i Breidinn ok veizsluhall . . . , hann let gera veizsluhall i Husabœ i Skaun a Heidmork ok adra a Ringisakri (he made a farm and a banqueting-hall at Hof in Breidinn . . . , he made a banqueting-hall in Husaby in Skaun in Heidmork and another one in Ringisaker)” (Brink, “Political and Social Structures,” 242–43, quoting and translating from the version of  Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar [here titled Saga Hakonar konungs gamla, or The Saga of King Hákon the Old] in GuDbrandr Vigfússon and C.

As Norwegian historian Knut Helle describes, the conversion-era reigns from 995 to 1066 of  “kings such as Óláfr Trygg- vason, Óláfr Haraldsson and Harald the Hard-Ruler” were marked not only by “political unification,” “religious unification,” and “the introduction of the first elements of  a Norwegian church organization” but by a growing awareness of  “the importance of  urban centres. The later kings’ sagas depict them as active promoters of  the first Norwegian towns” and as having played “an important role in giving such places full urban status in the eyes of  contemporaries.”95 Archaeologist Charlotte Fabech also affirms a causal link between christianization and the privileging of  unique political/religious centers in Scandinavian polities: “As long as the de- central pagan social system worked, it was difficult for a king to establish a proper royal centre. . . . The conversion to Christianity . . . legitimised a concentration of  power to fewer sites, and the towns were thus given an advantage compared to the rural settlement of  manors, church villages and marketplaces. . . . A permanent royal residence and the thought of  a capital town only occurred centuries later.”96 Do such facts and their interpretation suggest, however, that Scandi- navian elites prior to conversion accepted Smith’s alternative map, the utopian, that which stresses “the value of  being in no place,” “which per- ceives terror and confinement in interconnection, correspondence and repe- 95 Knut Helle, “The History of  the Early Viking Age in Norway,” in Ireland and Scandi- navia in the Early Viking Age, ed. Howard B. Clarke, Máire Ní Mhaonaigh, and Raghnall Ó Floinn (Dublin: Four Courts, 1998), 258. Elsewhere, Helle describes the appearance of  the “first Norwegian towns,” sites that were not just trade but also political and ideological centers, as “an indication of  a certain degree of  royal and ecclesiastical centralization” (“Part 1: Down to 1536,” in Norway: A History from the Vikings to Our Own Times, ed. Rolf Danielsen, Ståle Dyrvik, Tore Grønlie, Knut Helle, and Edgar Hovland, trans. Michael Drake [Oslo: Scandinavian University Press, 1995], 32). Taking a more nuanced view, but one that extends to the Danish and Swedish kingdoms, archaeologist Johan Callmer writes that while talk of  urban centers and urbanization should not be limited to the period after ca. 1000, it nonetheless seems that a “new type of  town combining the role of  centre and trading place was introduced . . . in the second half  of  the 10th century” (“Urbanization in Scandinavia and the Baltic Region c. AD 700–1100: Trading Places, Centres, and Early Urban Sites,” in De- velopments around the Baltic and the North Sea in the Viking Age: The Twelfth Viking Con- gress, ed.

Still, from either angle it seems clear that those who produced and consumed Norse myths, and especially myths of  ÓDinn, were neither locative nor utopian mapmakers. The map of  these Norse mythmakers might best be described as “tactical,” in de Certeau’s sense of  the term: rather than privilege any single, several, or even all of the cosmos’s multiple and competing centers, the “aggregate of  farm- steads” described by Gurevich, Norse myths valorize the ability, pre- eminently embodied by ÓDinn, to move through and make use of  spaces controlled by others, with the aims of  co-opting resources, defusing threats, and shifting, if  only temporarily, the balance of  powers in one’s favor. Rather than “terror and confinement in interconnections,” such a map’s makers perceive risk but also opportunity in movement between its multiple nodes. In terms of  time, there is in this tactical map neither “re- bellion” against the state of  things nor a pronounced desire for “flight to a new world and a new mode of  creation.” ÓDinn is not a savior or messiah who appears to lead alienated adherents out of  present chaos or disenfranchisement into eternal order and power, but a god who joins his followers in an unrelenting struggle that all are aware can only end in their own destruction. One finds in ÓDinn’s myths no expectation or hope that the efforts of  even the supreme tactician will result in his ultimate ascension to the position of  strategist, but rather acquiescence to the fact that he will and must continue to employ tactics until reaching his, and his world’s, inevitable extinction. While it would be possible to halt my analysis with the claim that ÓDinn’s career and character reflect the shared social conditions and in- terests of  poets and kings, it seems to me that his myths also provide evi- dence for competition between these groups and ambivalence in their relations. For while poets and kings can be treated as members of  a single stratum of  medieval Norse society, they did not share equally in the dis- tribution of  resources and capacities accorded value in their rarefied sphere: each group had something the other wanted owing to its dominance in one of  two arenas of  experience. Simply put, kings held the edge in terms of  space, skalds in terms of  time. Recognizing this allocation of  advantages helps us to understand the essence of  their transactions: kings provided poets with a space in which to operate and prosper, while poets supplied kings with a means to extend their names and reputations in time. Each 97 Smith, Map Is Not Territory, 101, 309. </page> <page sequence="31"> 346 God on the Margins side’s desire for what the other had to offer is explicit in the sources. For example, the ninth-century poet Einarr Helgason recites: “The gold- sender [poet] lets the getter of  land [king] enjoy Yggr’s mead [poetry]; the prince gladdens the host of  men, I am permitted to receive his lar- gesse.”98 And Snorri Sturluson boasts in his Háttatal (List of  meters), the longest and among the latest of  skaldic panegyrics, that “the princes’ praise will live forever unless humanity passes away, or the worlds end.”99 While the proposed exchange may appear unbalanced insofar as skalds’ contri- bution is less tangible than what kings had to offer, those involved were unlikely to have seen it this way—in what is, for good reason, among the most cited snippets of  Old Norse verse, Hávamál intones: “Cattle die, kinsmen die, you yourself  will die the same; but fame will never die, for him who wins it.”100 Given that poets and kings were at liberty to supply (or not) something those in the other group highly desired but could not secure for them- selves, it is worth considering whether myths of  ÓDinn provided an arena wherein not only common interests and perspectives were expressed, but tensions between these groups played out. The first thing to note in this respect is that ÓDinn more often assumes a role typical of  poets than of kings, arriving at a hall unannounced, unknown, with something to offer his host but almost always uncertain of  his reception. There emerges, moreover, from several sources a pattern in which ÓDinn enacts what might be labeled motif  1 (spatial and/or social marginality) so as to activate or realize motif  2 (ephemerality of  authority). The frame story of Grímnismál provides one of  the clearer examples of  this pattern. Its prose prelude introduces the princes Agnarr and GeirrøDr, who, having been lost at sea and washed ashore on an island, are fostered by Frigg and ÓDinn, disguised as a peasant couple. Though GeirrøDr is the younger brother, ÓDinn conspires to have him take his father’s place as king, while con- signing Agnarr to a fate “raising children with a giantess in a cave.”101 When ÓDinn later travels as Grímnir to GeirrøDr’s hall, Frigg arranges matters so that GeirrøDr will suspect his guest of  sorcerous ill intent and seize him as soon as he arrives. ÓDinn’s only relief  as he spends the length of  the poem suspended between two fires is provided by the king’s 98 “Gollsendir lætr grundar (glaDar Âengill her drengja), hans mæti knák hljóta, hljót Yggs mjaDar njóta” (Vellekla 33, in Den norsk-islandske skjaldedigtning BI: Rettet tekst, ed.

While it has been doubted whether this narrative supplies the original context of  the poem, the relevant elements are present in the verse as well as its frame. The motif  of  disguise remains, as ÓDinn provides a lengthy list of  assumed names before stating his own in the final verse; he clearly undergoes an ordeal in another’s hall; most important, owing to his (mis)- treatment as a guest, he ends the reign of  a king and inaugurates that of his heir. As the god declares: “Eight nights I sat here between the fires, so that no one offered me food, except Agnarr alone, who alone shall rule, GeirrøDr’s son, the land of  the Goths.”102 GeirrøDr’s lack of  hospitality also robs him of  a king’s afterlife; as ÓDinn informs him near the poem’s conclusion, “you lose much when you lose my favour, and that of  all the einherjar.”103 A similar story is found in HeiDreks saga ok Hervarar, in which ÓDinn assumes the identity of  Gestumblindi, a not-so-clever adherent who wishes to reconcile with King HeiDrekr. ÓDinn as Gestum- blindi visits the king and agrees to redeem himself  by winning a riddle contest. When ÓDinn reveals his identity with the (more question than) riddle about his whispered message on Baldr’s funeral pyre, HeiDrekr shouts “You alone know that, vile creature!” and tries with his sword to strike the god down.104 As ÓDinn flies off  in falcon’s form (less some tail feathers), he calls back, “For this, King Heidrek, that you have attacked me, and would slay me without offence, the basest slaves shall be the death of  you.”105 The curse soon comes to pass, and HeiDrekr’s son Angantyr takes his place. The fact that HeiDrekr had earlier killed and usurped the place of  his older brother Angantyr while being fostered by the “wisest of  men” Gizurr GrytingaliDi, in whom critics have seen yet another double of  ÓDinn, ties this story even more closely to that which frames Grímnismál.106 A third example of  this pattern is found in Völsunga saga. Here, a royal wedding feast is interrupted when “a man came into the hall alone . . . unknown to any . . . he has a spotted cloak over himself  . . . and a hood down over his head. He was hoary and old and one-eyed . . . No one 102 “Átta nætr sat ec milli elda hér, svá at mér mangi mat né bauD, nema einn Agnarr, er einn scal ráDa, GeirroDar sonr, Gotna landi” (Grímnismál 2, in Edda, Neckel ed., 57). 103 “miclo ertu hnugginn, er Âú ert míno gengi, öllom einheriom oc ÓDins hylli” (Grím- nismál 51, in Edda, Neckel ed., 67).

On the parallels and possible relation of  these two sources or stories, see Tolkien’s introduction, xvi–xviii. </page> <page sequence="33"> 348 God on the Margins welcomed that man.”107 The newcomer, who is of  course ÓDinn, sinks a sword into a tree growing in the midst of  the hall, declaring that whoever draws it out will have his support. Since ÓDinn later shatters this same sword as it is wielded in battle by King Sigmundr, the weapon is clearly meant to serve as a symbol of  the god’s bestowal and removal of  favor. If this story is less concentrated in its presentation of  motifs than the other two, the pattern and ideas are the same; in all three, a disguised ÓDinn appears as a less than welcome guest and, after the lord of  the hall and/ or his following fail a test of  hospitality and/or trustworthiness, effects a transfer of  royal authority. My last example is a story that extends this combination of  motifs, having ÓDinn enact motif  1 (marginality) so as to exploit motif  2 (ephemerality) in a way that alleviates motif  1 for another, a warrior- poet. Örvar-Odds saga is the tale of  Oddr Grímsson, nicknamed “Arrow- Oddr,” whom ÓDinn assists in various guises and situations. In the rele- vant episode, Oddr, having fallen on such hard times that he has gone into exile in the woods, clad himself  in bark, and repudiated his true name, happens upon the farm of  a certain Jólfr and his wife. The couple take the “Bark-man” in, and Jólfr, who is ÓDinn, soon offers to help Oddr find a place in the following of  the local king, HerrauDr. As they near the king’s hall, however, Jólfr grows hesitant: “ ‘Why are you now dragging your feet?’ said Oddr. ‘Because,’ said the old man, ‘I will be placed in shackles if  I come inside here, and because of  this I will be happiest when I am going away.’ ‘No,’ said the Bark-man, ‘we two shall clear the way together, and I will not allow anything other than you carrying on.’ ”108 Once they enter the hall, Jólfr is molested as predicted, but with Oddr’s help comes before HerrauDr, to whom he introduces his com- panion. Though Oddr still refuses to provide his name and will not admit to having any useful skills, the king accepts him into his hirD. When Oddr’s talents and identity are eventually made known, HerrauDr invites him to sit “in the high seat next to himself. . . . The king lays such great honor on Oddr, that he valued no man more than him.”109 In time, Oddr, 107 “maDr einn gekk inn í höllina, sá maDr er mönnum úkunnr at syn . . . hann hefir heklu flekótta yfir sér . . . ok hött síDan á höfDi.

In considering how these stories combine and employ ÓDinnic motifs, a certain bias emerges. In each, a representative or embodiment of  mar- ginality, whether this is ÓDinn or someone he aids, comes out on top over a representative or, perhaps more accurately, victim of  ephemerality, namely, a king. In other words, those who lack (initially) control over space consistently trump those who lack control over time. Of  course, such victories are never absolute, since in overcoming spatial or social marginality one becomes ever more subject to transience—no transition from tactician to strategist can be permanent. This point is demonstrated above all by the doubled use in Grímnismál of  the name Agnarr and in HeiDreks saga of  Angantyr, to denote first a victim and second a bene- ficiary of  ÓDinn’s tricks, and between whom in both instances are sand- wiched kings whom ÓDinn installs only later to remove.110 In addition, then, to understanding ÓDinn and his career as reflecting the social sit- uation of  poets and kings, as well as a means of  symbolically mitigating the anomic consequences of  their shared condition, we may perceive in them something of  a veiled threat or assertion of  superiority directed from the primary producers to the primary consumers of  his myths. Finally, it remains to consider our second overarching question, whether and to what extent the above observations regarding the myths of  ÓDinn challenge the view that it is the quintessential function of  religion to supply things human, characterized by impermanence, contingency, and unreality, with meaning or authority derived from things divine, characterized by eternity, absoluteness, and reality. Though I see no reason to doubt that pagan northerners looked to their myths as social charters, regarding mythic figures, events, and patterns as models for and of  their own practice, I find nothing to suggest that the charter or signification thus supplied was regarded as eternally valid or utterly transcendent. Nor do I find much to indicate that this was a source of  anxiety for the makers and consumers of  the myths. While like any god worthy of  the name, ÓDinn offered adherents an elevated image of  themselves, his was a more realistic than idealized reflection. ÓDinn was a god whose nature and experiences closely paralleled his followers’ own, up to and including the qualities of itinerancy and transience. The difference, in short, separating ÓDinn from humans was quantitative, not qualitative. 110 The ineluctability of  transience is also demonstrated by the fact that Oddr, even though he has a preternaturally long life of  three hundred years, eventually succumbs to a cradle- side prophecy, and by the way in which ÓDinn in the Völsung cycle does not rest until he has claimed virtually every last member of  the tribes he has set at odds. </page> <page sequence="35"> 350 God on the Margins One way to avoid the complications this observation poses for defini- tions of  religion that rest upon a Platonic-Augustinian insistence that a radical gulf  separate spiritual from terrestrial modes of  existence is, of course, to deny that the sources for ÓDinn supply us with insight into genuine myth or religion. This is essentially what Eliade tried to do with another set of  materials known for its anthropomorphic gods and fatalism: “Homer,” he writes, “was neither a theologian nor a mythographer. . . . He had composed his poems for a specific audience: the members of  a military and feudal aristocracy. . . . He avoided evoking religious or myth- ological conceptions that were either foreign to his essentially patriarchal and military auditors or in which they took little interest.111 Here, Eliade rejects the authentic religiosity of  the Homeric hymns because they fail to speak either for or to the insights and hopes of  archaic humanity. In so doing, Eliade commits a fallacy opposite of  that which Lincoln cautions against—rather than mistake an elite ideology for normative religion, he seeks to disqualify it from religious status altogether. If  such materials, however, are accepted as data for theory about religion, they raise un- deniably important considerations, such as the implication that religion or myth need not involve a search for eternal verities or union with un- changing Being, or that religious legitimation for human action and justi- fication for human existence are not always grounded in entities or realities regarded as fundamentally transcendent or Other. In short, the myths of ÓDinn suggest that, for some religions at least, the realm of  becoming is quite enough to worry about. Western Michigan University 111 Mircea Eliade, Myth and Reality, trans.
