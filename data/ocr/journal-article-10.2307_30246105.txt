Recycling can be considered an example of the systemic transformation of an item from state to state (Schiffer 1976:36). One such example of state change is the reuse of items from a prehistoric context by members of an ongoing cultural system. In the Southwest, the Navajo are among the best known for this practice. Navajo ceremonial reuse of figurines from Anasazi ruins has been known at least since the 1920s (Judd 1950). Similarly, some Navajo cere- monialists reuse prehistoric Anasazi sites for the placement of anthropomorphic figurines during the "Remaking of the Baby Figurine" rite (Gill 1974; Spain 1982). By comparison, the ceremonial reuse of prehistoric items by some other Southwestern groups is less well known. This report discusses examples of reuse of materials from archaeological sites by the Pima and illustrates a new example. In 1908, Frank Russell published his classic study, The Pima Indians, based on research conducted among these people in 1901- 1902. Russell noted that the Pima obtained stone axes from ruins in the area and that these axes were generally used to resharpen metates (1908:110). He also recorded one fragmentary and two whole Hoho- kam tablets or palettes that he had collected from Pima medicine men (1908:112). These palettes were used to cure "doctor's disease" (1908:266). As a part of this ritual, they were placed in a vessel of water, which was then given to the patient to drink. Although Russell (1908:266) was told that no marks of any kind were made on the palettes, an example he illustrated in Figure 33 "has the figure of a horse scratched on one side and that of a man on the other" (1908:112). Another Hohokam palette, collected from the Pima and identified in museum records as reused, exists in the collection of the Museum fir Vilker- kunde, Abteilung Amerikanische Naturvilker (Ethnographic Museum, Divi- sion of American Aboriginal Peoples) in West Berlin, the Federal Republic of Germany (Catalog No. IVB.4764) (Figure 1). The palette is 11 cm in length and 6 cm in width. Design consists of a simple band of chevrons around the rim. In both length and design the palette is similar to those described by Russell and resembles the Santa Cruz phase Hohokam palettes reported by Gladwin and others (1938:124; see also Haury 1976:287). Museum records indicate the palette was collected by an individual named Keam, but the records do not show whether this person was William Keam, 237</page><page sequence="2">238 BRONITSKY Figure 1.

Kaemlein (1967:93,100), who lists the palette in her study, An Inventory of Southwestern American Indian Specimens in European Museums, identifies this object as belonging to the museum's Keam Collection, which she ascribes to Thomas Keam. She also indicates that the palette was accessioned in 1901. The finding of this palette adds to our knowledge of Pima recycling in particular and aboriginal reuse of prehistoric materials in general. I suspect that an analysis of cases of this kind, a number of which have been documented, would show that this reuse played a more important role in subsistence and religious practices than previously thought. Finally, the palette serves as a reminder of the potential usefulness of objects from the Southwest that have found their way to European museums. Acknowledgments. I want to thank Prof. Giinther Hartmann, Director of the Abteilung Amerikanische NaturvSlker of the Museum fiir Volkerkunde in Berlin, and his assistants, for their help in letting me examine their collections and for providing not one but two photos of the palette after the first one was lost during my return to the United States.
