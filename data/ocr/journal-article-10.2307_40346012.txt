Despite the controversy over the concept itself, all interlocutors converge in the need to focus on the material aspect of the world, on the material part of material culture. Historically, this could be seen as a counteraction to an overt emphasis upon the cultural as an intellectual construct that has dominated many recent attempts to reconstruct the past (Lofgren 1997: 102-3; Schiffer 1999: 6; Olsen 2003: 90), but the move does not restrict itself to that. Accordingly, in this issue our understanding and use of the term is on the broadest level. It pertains to the "thingness" of things (Meskell 2004: 13-4), to that aspect of things that gives them a material presence in the world. Representations are as material as any other thing. They are articulated in particular contexts, engaging particular materials, having a particular material presence, informing our understanding of the world and of the proper way to inhabit it. Representing something can have many different meanings and connotations, but it always entails referring to something else. Whether we choose to keep the term "representation" (Nanoglou, this issue) or abandon it (Meskell et al. 2008), we argue against a certain tradition that sees representations as above society only mirroring other entities and other practices, and we think it is time to reposition them within the world, to understand them as part of the world they attempt to represent, to see them as real and tangible in themselves (see Meskell 2004, 2005, 2007: 137). Representations are never floating signifiers; they always occupy a certain place in the world from which they address people and get addressed by them. Their referential aspect is always situated in S.

This particularity is exactly the subject of this special issue. The papers that follow try to situate artifacts representing people or animals within the particular material conditions from which they informed their users. This endeavor has its pitfalls, since it is easy to fall back to a materialistic discourse, one that attributes too much value to the "innate properties" of things. We argue that the resurgence of the material is important, but we need to construe of things in terms of materialisation as a process, rather than as finite products that combine predetermined properties. What is really important is to put more weight on the actual process of re-articulating a form (for example the human body) in a different materiality and the effect this could have on the materialisation of social action, that is we should pay more attention to how associations between entities are made and how the particular materiality of each affects the other. In this collection, we focus primarily on the materialisation of human bodies but also animal bodies, since there are occurrences where the boundaries between the two are not clear (Meskell 2008; Nakamura and Meskell 2004 and this issue; Nanoglou, this issue), and in many cases, these and other entities are constituted against each other. We ask what kinds of bodies are articulated by such diverse media as small clay or stone figurines, big stone stelae or clay furnaces shaped as humans, and how the body is constituted through enduring, monumental practices or through the often fragile, repetitive practices of figurine making. Inhabiting a landscape populated with such varied images, people are forced to embody varied values regarding a proper or a viable way to go on (Bachand et al. 2003). The ontological status of representations is constantly brought to bear upon our own. Variation in the former cannot but generate different effects on the latter. The Papers and the Issues Raised From the beginning Lynn Meskell and I refrained from offering a detailed framework to the authors and instead invited each one to offer their own view of materiality and representation. We certainly hoped that this way we could tackle the subject from various aspects and with various methodologies that would help refresh our understanding of representation and its position within the world. We did propose that the issue might have a focus on one of the most widely studied categories, i.e., figurines, and its relation to other forms of fabrication, more monumental as it were, in order to understand and give an account of this variation, but this was not obligatory, and it did not inform all the papers in the issue. Nevertheless, and despite the lack of any precirculated theoretical manifesto, certain points that seem significant have emerged from the papers emphatically presented as case studies. Consider the issue of the durability of objects or their transience and the associated history of ascribed values. It is fair to say that the whole discipline of archaeology is based on the endurance of things. Apart from that, if representations remain in circulation for a considerable time, even to a point that they outlive individual lives, they constitute a rather firm framework in which people accustom themselves to a world and get to know the proper way to inhabit it (see Meskell 2008). On the contrary, fragile objects, even objects that are made to be consumed £} Springer</page><page sequence="3">The Materiality of Representation: A Preface 159 instantly, address people in scenes that put more weight on the particular event. The issue of monumentality and memory is pertinent here (Meskell 2003; Joyce 2003; see also Forty and Kiichler 1999) and is aptly tackled by Robb in this issue. He considers the staging of and engagement with human stelae that arguably have a monumental character: they are not easily moved (although they did move in certain cases), and they configure a specific figural landscape for their users. People move around them rather than carry them in their hands as with figurines. The same is true of other cases, where durable representations were still standing years after their construction and guided social action. In striking contrast to that, small fragile figures, made of baked, or even unbaked clay, had a much shorter life and were perhaps used only in certain moments (Meskell 2007; Meskell et al. 2008). Longevity is of course not only an issue of durable materials. The number of replasterings of molded figures in ^atalhoyiik (Last 2005: 202) shows that the life and the effect of certain representations was contingent upon other things as well. Related to the monumentality and the durability of certain figures in comparison to others is, of course, the issue of the material that the figures are made of. Robb highlights the fact that the stelae were made of stone and addresses the specificities of the use of such a material (see also Nanoglou 2008). Clark (this issue) also delves on the subject of the material and the production of the figures, following the suggestion that we should see figurines as processes rather than finite objects (see Meskell 2007; Nakamura and Meskell this issue). She considers Harappan figurines and builds her case on the specificity of clay as a material, but she also offers insights pertaining to materials that might not be discernible (pigments added to the artifacts). In that she is close to the point raised by Schmidt (this issue) that the production process might entail aspects not readily observable, which are nevertheless significant for the meaningfulness of the artifacts (see below). In a certain way, the relation between monumentality, durability, and transience is also tackled by Nakamura and Meskell (this issue) and Nanoglou (this issue). Nakamura and Meskell compare figurines at (^atalhoyiik to figures mounted on walls and human burials, whereas Nanoglou shows that in northern Greece, small and fragile figures are sometimes deposited in "monumental" contexts. Additionally, these two papers attack the subject of the materiality of representation focusing mainly on the form of the figures and their specificity, either tracing particular traits that were highlighted on the figures (Nakamura and Meskell) or following the diverse media of representation and their concomitant uses (Nanoglou). Evidently, the particular form of an artifact and the context of its use or deposition provokes different actions from its users and accordingly helps in constituting different subjectivities. In this vein, the practices that relate to the use of any artifact and the scenes where such a use takes place emerge as tantamount for an understanding of the process of materialisation. Although this is a key point in every paper of the collection, it is most clearly presented in Schmidt's contribution where he highlights the way that these material objects are enmeshed in actions, which are indispensable for the production of meanings and values. His ethnoarchaeological work focuses on the production of African iron smelting furnaces shaped like female bodies and succeeds in showing that the artifacts that have survived are but a fraction of a range of things that participated in the materialisation of a figure. Certain actions were necessary for the construction to be considered a true body, actions whose material trace was often frail and perishable. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="4">160 Nanoglou This discussion is of course not exhaustive, and the papers raise many more points regarding the materiality of representation. They point to the diversity of representations and their presence in the world, a presence always situated and conditioned by specific contingencies. The traces left by these diverse materialities are quite different. Long-lasting images constitute a landscape with a temporality other than our own. We come to live and learn how to live in a world where some of these images stay longer than us, perhaps even being there before us. They constitute a framework that spreads over time and informs our actions surreptitiously, sometimes moving to the background of social life or becoming the background for social action. Most importantly, they can relate to different and diverse performances, in a way becoming associated with a varied gamut of practices that transverse our whole life. Monumental images may not always be long-lasting, but even in such cases, they impose themselves upon us in quite specific ways. On the contrary, small figurines that break (e.g., Chapman 2000; Talalay 1987) or even melt or disintegrate (see Kuchler 2002) leave mostly passing traces that are tied to specific moments and scenes of engagement. They may even not outlive these moments, and thus the imagery they articulate may be explicitly bound with the practices performed there, only to be remembered and commemorated through other media (language or other, Kuchler 2002: 112). How does this approach help us move forward? To say that our world is material is immensely banal, yet we tend to leave objects out of the picture, letting "just people" to dominate the field (Latour 2005). Latour has argued that to counter such a trend, to probe "an object-oriented democracy is to research what are the material conditions that may render the air breathable again" (Latour 2005: 18). In other words, what is at stake here concerns the material conditions that make social life (or just life for that matter) possible. Representations in general - and figurines in particular - have played the role of providing a window to these conditions for too long, suggesting that they stand outside these conditions as some kind of mirror that, although distorting, offers nonetheless a viewpoint from which to observe people's life in the past (Meskell 2005). Contrary to that, considering the materiality of representation helps us understand that these artifacts are an indispensable part of the material conditions that render the air breathable, that make life, always a specific life, possible.
