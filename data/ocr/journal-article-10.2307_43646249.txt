<plain_text><page sequence="1">VARIATIONS ON THEMES FROM EMPEDOCLES IN LUCRETIUS' PROEM by David Furley Commenting on Lucretius 1, 2-3 and 6-9, Munro wrote: "Thus early the poet calls attention to the three great divisions of the world, to which he as well as other writers before and after him so constantly revert that the thing passed into a common proverb: mare terra caelum di vostram fidem , says Pļautus Trin . 1070. .. .ut nulla pars cáelo mari terra , ut poetice loquar , praetermissa sit , says Cicero De finibus 5, 9." Similar remarks are to be found in the commentaries of Giussani (p. 11), Ernout and Robin (p. 5), Leonard and Smith (p. 199) and Cyril Bailey (p. 592). 1 It has apparently not been observed that the picture of lines 2-3 is not simply repeated in lines 6-9. What Munro says is perfectly true of lines 2-3: caeli subter labentia signa / quae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferentis / concelebras. But the picture is significantly changed in lines 6-9, where two propositions refer to caelum : te, dea, te fugiunt venti, te nubila caeli adventumque tuum, tibi suavis daedala tellus summittit flores, tibi rident aequora ponti placatumque nitet diffuso lumine caelum. The picture in these lines is not the threefold division of the world common in poetic tradi- tion, but the fourfold division which belongs to the tradition of natural philosophy. The cosmos consists of four great masses, distinguished by the character of the elements or substances which compose them. Traditionally they are earth, water, air and fire. Most Greek philosophers of nature, including Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus and the Stoics, agreed that our world consists approximately of layers, with earth at the bottom or centrę, water above it, air above water, and fire above air (Aristotle added a fifth, but we need not consider it here). Let us postpone consideration of the fourth of these lines of Lucretius for the moment. There can be no doubt about the identification of the three lower elements in lines 6-8. The first sentence is about the "winds and clouds of the sky", which are typical manifestations of the element 'air'. The second is about earth, and the third is about the sea. There is nothing ambiguous. Lucretius is offering a description of spring. He could have said that the clouds disperse and the snows melt; he could have substituted imbres for venti. Instead, he chooses 55</page><page sequence="2">to mention only the things that the tradition treats unambiguously as air . In the second sentence, he might have said only that the flowers bloom; instead he makes earth the subject. The 'laugh- ter' of the sea is not an inevitable part of the picture of spring; he might have preferred to talk about trees budding, birds singing, cattle leaving their stalls, ploughmen leaving their fires, or about many other things, or about nothing else. Instead, he adds a third sentence which is about the sea and nothing but the sea. Having observed the trio, air, earth and sea, anyone versed in Greek philosophy of nature will expect some mention of the fourth. What is missing so far is something about the sun and the other heavenly bodies, the source of heat and light in the upper sky, above the winds and the clouds. So it is no surprise to find that the fourth line singles out this fourth division of the cosmos just as unambiguously and exclusively as the first three. *********** It may be objected that the fourth sentence is formally somewhat different from the other three, and therefore ought not to be considered as co-ordinate with them. There is triple anaphora in the first three sentences (lines 6-8), and the fourth is detached. The fourth does not mention the fourth in a list of elements, but simply returns to the subject of the first, the caelum ; the description of the sky, shining and peaceful, leads up to the 'opening' of the face of spring in the next line (10), and thus to the renewal of growth and propagation of living species. It is true that the fourth sentence is not exactly co-ordinate and parallel with the first three. Formally it serves as the climax of the four line passage. The fact that this sentence is the only one of the four to fill one line exactly, and the restful spondaic rhythm with the long vowels of placatum and diffuso lumine, make it a little different from the other three. It is a kind of destination, towards which the others have been leading. But it achieves this effect not by repeating something, nor by summing up, but by moving on, in sense, to the remaining member of the fourfold division. There is nothing surprising or unusual in a structure in which the last member of a group receives emphasis by being treated somewhat differently in syntax. It is not true that the fourth sentence simply repeats the first. The disappearance of the clouds may cause the light of the upper sky to shine on earth. But the clouds are not the same as the light. The sentence about the clouds differs from the sentence about the light in just this way, that according to the traditional fourfold division the former says something about ait and the latter says something about fire. It may be objected that if Lucretius had meant to distinguish clearly between air and fire he would not have mentioned caelum twice, and would have chosen a clearer expression for the the fourth sentence. It is true that caelum is usually the upper sky, and especially the heavenly bodies. It is normally the equivalent of oúpavós.2 The things that belong to the region below the stars are technically called peTewpa. But there is nothing very surprising about the expres- sion nubila caeli, which Lucretius uses twice elsewhere. He can also say that clouds cover the sky (5, 466). Obviously caelum is not a very precise expression, and it may include both of the upper two cosmic divisions. Lucretius divides the cosmos into two, terra and caelum at 5,245. The upper element is usually thought of as fire, and its characteristic property as heat. But a reference to the upper element does not necessarily mention fire or heat. The basic distinction between the two upper elements in this fourfold division of the cosmos is between the heavenly bodies, which give light or heat or both, and the air, which merely transmits light and heat or 56</page><page sequence="3">else takes the form of winds and clouds which are obstacles to light and heat. Light is thus one of the essential characteristics of the upper element, and Lucretius was not running any risk of ambiguity when he chose to talk about the light of the sky. Other expressions used by Lucretius to refer to the upper division of the cosmos, or to parts of it, are largus . . . liquidi fons luminis , aetherius sol (5,281), solis rota . . . lumine largo alti- volans (5,432-33), aether ignifer (5,458 and elsewhere), and of course ignis and aether separately. He might have spoken in line 9 about any of these. But a clear mention of the light of the upper sky was sufficient for his purpose. It may be objected that Lucretius would be merely confusing the issue by mentioning the four elements here, since he was about to present a poetic exposition of the atomic theory, which rejected the four elements. Indeed, the poem itself contains a detailed criticism of the theory of four elements, at 1,763-829. But a distinction has to be made here. It is true, of course, that the Epicureans rejected the theory that the world is made of four irreducible elements, eternally endowed with the pro- perties of earth, water, air and fire. It is true too that they rejected the Aristotelian theory of the four primary bodies which exchange properties with each other. But they did not deny the existence of earth, water, air and fire, nor did they deny that these four are in some way more basic than other substances. In particular, they were quite willing to accept the fourfold division of our cosmos into these four. In his long polemic against the idea that the cosmos is eternal, Lucretius goes through the four divisions one by one, to show that each of them is mortal: earth (5,251-60); water (261-72); air (273-80); fire (281-305). In his own cosmogony he describes how the four masses came to be in their present position (5,433-508). sic igitur terrae concreto corpore pondus constitit atque omni s mundi quasi limus in imum confluxit gravis et subsedit funditus ut faex; inde mare inde aer inde aether ignifer ipse corporibus liquidis sunt omnia pura relicta. (495-99) ************ We may now consider the four lines 6-9 in relation to their context in the proem. Lines 1-5 contain the address to Venus, mentioning what will turn out to be the poet's reason for addressing his prayer to her and not to some other fount of inspiration: she fills the sea and the earth with living creatures. Next, the four lines we have studied: spring is brought about by Venus' power over the four cosmic masses. Then as soon as the cosmos takes on its vernal aspect (nam simul ac species patefactast verna diei ), the whole animal world, inspired by Venus, devotes itself joyously to propagating its kind (10-20). 3 Lucretius then sums up his reasons for praying to Venus, and states his prayer. Since she alone thus governs the whole of nature ( rerum naturam sola guberņas) , and without her nothing is born into the realm of light and nothing happy or delightful comes to be, he asks her to be with him as he writes about nature (de rerum natura ), for Memmius, whom she has always favoured (21-28). He adds a second prayer, for peace per maria ac terras. Venus has the power to charm Mars, and thus to bring peace to mortals. If the Romans are not at peace, Lucretius cannot find the tranquillity to write, and Memmius must give his attention to the country's security. 57</page><page sequence="4">In the long history of scholarly criticism, many different meanings have been perceived in this proem. For example, some have stressed the connexions with Epicurean theory: Venus is "the pleasure of the gods and men", and pleasure is of course the goal of life for an Epi- curean. On the other hand, some have viewed the proem against a purely literary background, and have quoted examples of invocations to deities in other poems. Others have sought for the explanation of the proem in the Roman context: there is evidence for a cult of Venus physica , and there is evidence of a connexion between the family of Memmius and the cult of Venus.4 The intention of this present argument is not to deny the force of these other observations; Lucretius' proem is not a simple or single-minded piece of work. There is no doubt whatever that its surface appearance - an invocation to an anthropomorphic goddess - is not all that we are to see in it. Its meaning is to be found by interpretation, and there is no good reason to think that one line of interpretation alone will yield the whole of its meaning. The present intention is to emphasize one line in the complex harmony. The appeal to a divinity for inspiration, as it has often been said, is a traditional element in ancient poetry. That is to say, by beginning his poem in this way, Lucretius placed it in a succession; he placed himself in a certain relation to earlier writers. It is therefore worth asking some questions that have surprisingly not been pressed very hard by Lucretian scholars: which earlier writers does Lucretius claim as his predecessors, and what is the significance of his claim? The poem is to be on nature, de rerum natura. He addresses the goddess of Love because her influence on the four cosmic masses and on the animal kingdom brings about the creation of new life. Since she alone has this power over nature, she can inspire him to create a poem about nature. Moreover she has power over the god of Strife, and thus can bring peace to the cosmos; and this power again is needed, if his mind is to have the peace necessary for creation. There was one other poet who wrote a hexameter poem On Nature in which the goddess of Love had power over the four cosmic masses and over all the processes of creation in nature, and over the god of Strife: Empédocles. *********** Luckily, it can be proved that there is nothing far-fetched or improbable about the suggestion that Lucretius claimed to be a follower of Empédocles. Empédocles' Fíepi cpúaecos was well known from the time it was written until the time of Lucretius.^ Theophrastus wrote a book about Empédocles.^ Hermarchus, the third century Epicurean, wrote twenty-two open letters about him.7 More interestingly, a work called Empedoclea was written in Latin, by someone called Sallustius, at just the same time as Lucretius was writing his poem. This we know from one of Cicero's letters to his brother, written in 54 B.C., in which he mentions just two works: the poemata of Lucretius and the Empedoclea of Sallustius.8 It is clear that there was interest in Empédocles in the Roman literary world at this time. Lucretius could count on some know- ledge of him and his works. His own attitude to Empédocles is described explicitly in the well known lines of book 1: Empédocles was wrong to say that all things are made of four irreducible elements - but never- theless his discoveries were such that he seems like a god (712-33). Many instances have been pointed out in Lucretius' poem of imitation of lines of Empédocles;9 and perhaps we should recognize more if more of Empédocles had survived. It has never been doubted that Lucretius knew the works of Empédocles, either directly or from some intermediary source, and that he admired him. The point of this article is to prove 58</page><page sequence="5">something that has been doubted, that Lucretius wrote his proem so that comparison with Empé- docles was inevitable, and also to suggest that by prefacing his poem thus Lucretius was claiming a particular position for it in the history of natural philosophy. We must therefore make some detailed comparisons between Empédocles and Lucretius, first of all on the subjects brought up in the first 43 lines of De rerum natura . On the subject of the four elements, the most instructive fragments of Empédocles are B21 and 22. In B21, the four elements are listed. Fire is represented by the sun, which is charac- terized as "bright and hot".10 Air is described very obscurely, apparently as that which is passively "bathed in the heat and bright ray" of the sun. Water is represented by "rain, every- where dark and cold". Finally "from earth are born whatever are rooted and solid". In a briefer list in B22, the four appear as "the shining one (iļĀEKTcop), earth, sky (oupavos) and sea". It is noteworthy that air here counts as sky (as in Lucretius 1,6), and the fire of the upper sky is characterized by its brightness. It is also important that the four elements are identified not so much as materials , characterized by certain properties, but as distinct features of the cosmos, characterized not only by their properties but also by their position in the cosmos. Empédocles makes no distinction between these two roles. "The shining one" and the sea and the sky of fragment 22 are also the ingredients of mortal compounds. After listing the four elements or cosmic masses in B21, Empédocles continues: "In Anger [i.e. Strife] all are diverse in form and separate, but they come together in Love and are desired by each other. For out of these [come] all things that were and are and will be: trees grew, and men and women, and water-nurtured fish. . ." As in Lucretius' proem, the growth of plant and animal life is brought about by Love's work with the cosmic masses. Lucretius' use of this Empedoclean idea is very delicate. He cannot say, as Empédocles does, that living things grow from the mixture of these four elements, because that would commit him too precisely to the theory of the four elements, as the unchanging material out of which compounds are formed by mixture. Instead, he takes the four only as cosmic masses, in perfect conformity with Epi- curean theory, and relates them to the creation of living things through the idea of the season of spring. When we turn from the elements to the force or forces which move them, we find some diffi- culty in deciding what to say both about Empédocles and about Lucretius. At the present time, there is a fundamental disagreement among historians of Greek cosmology over the interpretation of Empédocles. According to one group, Empédocles' doctrine was that a period of cosmogony and zoogony brought about by the agency of Love was followed by a second period in which the same sorts of effect were brought about, in reverse order, by the agency of Strife.11 This would mean, presumably, that the generation of life might just as well be ascribed to Strife as to Love, and it would then be rather arbitrary to find a similarity between Lucretius' proem and the theory of Empédocles. It seems to me, however, that at least so far as zoogony is concerned the balance of the evidence is heavily in favour of the second view, according to which there is only one kind of zoogony in Empédocles, that brought about by the agency of Love. 12 But what did Lucretius himself think about Venus and Mars? We must make some careful distinctions. There is no doubt that Lucretius' cosmology included a polarity of creation and destruction, of associative forces and repellent forces. Indeed, how could it be otherwise, since he wanted to say that mortal things disintegrate, and are replaced by others, in a more or less balanced cycle? But to say that he believed in such forces is not to say that he believed in some kind of transcendent Duality. We know what the moving forces are in the Epicurean system: they are the weight, the collisions and the swerves of atoms. The effects of these forces depend on the shapes of the atoms involved. Sometimes collisions lead to the creation of a new compound, even of a new cosmos; sometimes they lead to destruction. It would be false to the spirit of Epicureanism to hypostasize these tendencies into a metaphysical Dualism. 59</page><page sequence="6">When Lucretius describes the origin of animals, which Empédocles explicitly puts down as the work of Love, he does not mention love or Venus at all; animals were born from mother Earth, but there are no sexual metaphors in the passage (5,783-820). Likewise in the passage where he warns the reader that the cosmos will disintegrate one day, he does not mention Strife (5,91- 109). His attitude to Venus, the goddess of sexual love, so reverent and significant in the first lines of the poem, becomes angry and contemptuous at the end of book 4. It seems clear that although Lucretius used Empédocles' theory of the four elements and his two cosmic forces of Love and Strife as a means to signify his enrolment in the Empedoclean tradition, it was not just these features of Empédocles' philosophy that he admired and claimed to follow. *********** The natural philosophy of Epicurus was put forward as an alternative to the world picture of the Platonists and Aristotelians, later adopted with some modifications by the Stoics. One of the chief points of difference was that the Epicureans believed the cosmos to be a compound which grew and will perish, made of everlasting physical elements, whereas the alternative theory made the cosmos either itself eternal and ungenerated, or else the creation of a divine craftsman who worked according to an eternal pattern. As a matter of historical fact, Empédocles is the earliest philosopher who is known to have worked out a theory of the growth of the cosmos from unchanging physical elements. In this respect the Epicureans were certainly followers of Empédocles. Lucretius evidently saw this as a feature of primary importance in Epicureanism, because it is the first physical doctrine he mentions, immediately after the prayer to Venus: rerum primordia pandam unde omni s natura creet res auctet alatque quove eadem rursum natura perempta resolvat. (1,55-57) Lucretius had every reason to pay tribute to Empédocles as the inventor of elements, even though he could not accept the Empedoclean theory in detail. It may be said that Empédocles' theory was different from Epicureanism in the crucial respect that his moving causes, Love and Strife, are gods, whereas the Epicureans insisted above all that gods are not needed to explain the growth of the cosmos or any other physical process. But it is clear that this feature of the Empedoclean theory does not necessarily contain anything offensive to the Epicureans. Lucretius may well have thought that it can be completely demytho- logized. The moving force called 'Love' or 'Aphrodite' is simply a force that attracts unlike elements to each other, and 'Strife' or 'Eris' is a force of repulsion between unlike elements.^ These are forces which are as natural as the weight, swerve and collisions of atoms. Lucretius himself, having written to Venus rerum naturam sola guberņas in 1,21 can say rerum primordia pandam | unde omnis natura creet res in lines 55-56. He may well have thought that Aphrodite in Empédocles' poem was as little inconsistent with a theory of purely natural causes as Venus evidently was in his own. The second fundamental point of difference between Epicureanism and its opponents was that the Epicureans rejected teleology. This statement needs no defence or elaboration here. What is relevant to the present argument is that Empédocles was sometimes regarded as the paradigm case of an anti-teleological philosopher of nature. Aristotle's classic defence of teleological explanation is in Physics B. He singles out Empédocles as the leading exponent of the wrong kind of philosophy of nature, and takes examples from the famous passage in 60</page><page sequence="7">Empédocles' ÍTepi cpuciecos in which he speaks of ßouyevrj ávSpÓTrpçopa. 14 The point is that Empédocles explained the formation of living forms as a random natural process, in which only the successful forms survived. This is exactly contrary to Aristotle's own view of nature, according to which processes are for the sake of the resultant forms. Lucretius follows Empé- docles particularly closely in the doctrine here criticized by Aristotle. His own account of the development of living forms includes translations of lines from the relevant part of Empé- docles' TTepi (pÚCTscos. 15 There is thus every reason to think that he made a similar assessment to Aristotle's of Empédocles' position in the history of the conflict about teleology. These two great points of difference - between a cosmos that grows naturally out of ele- mentary bodies and a created or eternal cosmos, and between 'mechanical' and teleological explanation - together constitute the essential distinction between Epicureanism and its oppo- nents. It is a distinction that marks off the succession of philosophers beginning with Empédocles and continuing with Anaxagoras, Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus, from the opposed tradi- tion of Plato and Aristotle. Lucretius' De rerum natura is the last great document of the former tradition in antiquity, and it is entirely appropriate that its proem should pay tribute to the pioneering work of Empédocles. sieste********* If Lucretius felt that he owed much to Empédocles, did this feeling clash in any way with his reverence for Epicurus? This is a question which may throw new light on the later part of the proem, lines 62-101. After the very brief statement of his theme in lines 54-61, which we have already quoted, Lucretius changes to the past tense to describe a historic event: humana ante oculos foede cum vita iaceret in terris oppressa gravi sub religione quae caput a caeli regionibus ostendebat horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans, primum Graius homo mortalis tollere contra est oculos ausus primusque obsistere contra. (1,62-67) This tribute has almost universally been assigned to Epicurus, although he is not mentioned by name. It is sufficiently similar in expression to the later passages which praise the work of Epicurus, 3, 1-17 and 5, 1-54; in these again Epicurus is not mentioned by name, but there can be no doubt that he is intended. Some strange features of 1,62-79, however, led one scholar, Ludwig Edelstein, to doubt whether Epicurus was meant at all. Epicurus was not , after all, the first Graius homo to seek to "break open the tight bolts of nature's gates" (lines 70-71) and to fight against religion (78-79). Edelstein suggested instead that Lucretius did not mean any particular Greek, but the Presocratics in general; he was stressing that the inventor of natural philosophy was a man , not a god, and a Greek , not an oriental. This suggestion was rightly rejected by subsequent editors. Nevertheless, Edelstein's doubts had a perfectly real foundation. There is something strange in what Lucretius attri- butes to Epicurus. As well as the historical anomaly already mentioned, we should note that the metaphor of the 'flight of the mind', common in ancient philosophy, 16 is particularly inappropriate to the atomic soul of Epicurean theory: ergo vivida vis animi pervicit, et extra proce ssit longe flammantia moenia mundi atque omne immensum peragravit mente animoque. (1,72-74) 61</page><page sequence="8">One of the most interesting occurrences of the 'flight of the mind1 is in a fragment of Empédocles, which is commonly taken to be about Pythagoras: Í1V Ô£ TIÇ £V K6ÍVOICTIV Ócvł|p TTÊpicÓaia ÊlÔOùS, os Sf| |jir|Ki(TTov upaTriScov 6KTÎ1CJCXTO ttAoOtov, TTavToicov tê páAiaTa aocpcõv (t') eTTirjpavos epycov ÒTT7TÓT6 yàp Trácjrjaiv òpáÇaiTO tt pocTTibecjoiv , peT' ò ye tcõv òvtcov ttocvtcov Aeuctíjecjkev ekocttov Kaí tê 5êk' ávOpcÓTTcov Kai t' ê'îkoctiv a'icóveaaiv. (B 129) Pythagoras when he "strained with all his mind" (irpairíôes) was able to see the whole of reality, ranging over many generations. Epicurus, because of his vivida vis animi , traversed the whole universe; his range was in space, not in time. Both passages stress that there was a single human being, unique among his peers, who performed this feat at a particular time: fjv 6e tis ev kêÍvoioiv ; primům Graius homo mortalis tollere contra | est oculos ausus . This fragment of Empédocles is from the Purifications. As he said in the opening line of this poem (B 112), people followed him "to hear a healing spell" (kAueìv ei/iļKea ßa^iv). The evidence is too fragmentary to give any certainty about the "diseases of all kinds" which were to be healed. But there is one very striking passage which clearly describes one aspect of the polluted life: poptpqv 6' áAAáÇavTa uaTTļp &lt;ptAov uiòv àeipas aqxxÇei etteuxÓpevos péya vt|ttios ' oi 8' daropeuvTai AiaaópÊVov OÚovtêç* ò Ô' aù vt|kou&lt;jtoç òpokAecov acpáÇas ev peyápoiai KaKtļv áAeyúvaTo 5aÏTa* (B 137, 1-4) This describes the ritual sacrifice of an animal - which may be identified with the sacrificer's son, because of the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration. Empédocles' message is that animals must not be killed, if human life is to be pure. Lucretius was not a believer in transmigration. But it is a remarkable fact that his first example of the pollution from which Epicurus rescued human life by his enquiry into nature is a human sacrifice: the sacrifice of Iphigeneia. 17 This is remarkable for many reasons: human sacrifice was not a feature of the religious practices of Epicurus' time, and was not in any way symbolic of the evils which he actually saw in the religion of the time. It is true that Ennius had treated the subject of Iphigeneia; but that does not seem a sufficient reason why Lucretius should put it in here. A much more likely explanation is that Lucretius was recalling this passage of Empédocles. The detailed similarities are quite numerous: both speak of a father sacrificing his child (which would indeed be an extraordinary coincidence, if it were coincidence); both describe the attendants who are embarrassed (oi Ô' aiTopeuvTai | Aiaaopsvov Oúovteç* hune propter ferrum celare ministros , aspectuque suo lacrimas effundere civis): ^ in both, the child knows and fears what is happening and adopts an attitude of prayer (Aiacrópevov : muta metu terram genibus summissa petebat ). The choice of the Iphigeneia story enables Lucretius both to place himself in the tradition of Greek epic verse, like Empédocles, and to repeat this theme from Empédocles without reference to the rejected theory of transmigration. It may reasonably be suggested, then, that in lines 62-101 Lucretius continues to make use of Empedoclean themes. He uses them in a most interesting way. Empédocles wrote not only ÍTepř cpóaecoę , which provided the model for the De rerum natura , but also KaOappoi. The relation between his two poems is notoriously obscure. ^ Very little survives from the KaSappoi. Did Empédocles think of his own physical doctrines, set out in the rīepi cpúaecos , as a means to 62</page><page sequence="9">'purification'? It seems unlikely. But it is true at least that he both wrote about nature and claimed to be a purifier of human life. Now Lucretius hints that Epicurus follows in this same tradition. He writes a tribute to Epicurus (primum Graius homo) that is deliberately ambiguous; in some respects it applies more exactly to Empédocles than to Epicurus.20 He implies that, like Empédocles, Epicurus found human life in a polluted state - polluted by wrong ideas about the gods and their relation to the cosmos - and like Empédocles he showed the way in his writings to be rid of the pollution .

There is a useful summary of the position in Kahn's review of Bollack. 13 Bollack and Kahn would say that Love attracts and Strife repels, without any stipulations about like and unlike. I am not yet convinced of this. 14 Aristotle Physics B7, 198b 29 ff.; Empédocles B61. 15 Compare Empédocles B82 with Lucretius 5, 788 ff.; B57 with 5, 837-41. 16 See Edelstein, n.12 on p. 81 for some examples. 17 Note how Lucretius makes the point about pollution by repeating 7 oede': foede cum vita iaceret (62); aram . . . turparunt sanguine foede (85). 18 There is some doubt about the reading.

Their reading would receive some slight confirmation if my comparison were accepted as valid. 19 See Kahn (1960) for a recent treatment of the problem. 20 The 'flight of the mind* passage in Empédocles is apparently about Pythagoras, not about himself.
