But with the help of a pair of specta- cles they will begin to read clearly.

(RoussEAU)3 A conference designed to further the discussion of a problem that has stood near the center of a scholar's career is surely the most fitting way to mark his or her retirement. I am grateful to W. Clark Gilpin, Dean of the University of Chicago Divinity School, that he chose to follow this sound academic custom when I ended my thirty-one years at the University. And I am grateful that, on the invitation of the dean and the editors, three of the lecturers at the conference agreed to publication of their contributions as essays in the Journal of Religion. Along with its precursor, the American Journal of Theology, JR (as we all call it) has served the theolog- ical community well, not simply as the in-house organ of the Divinity 'John Calvin, Institutio Christianae Religionis (Geneva, 1559), 1.6.1 (cited by book, chapter, and section).

I was privileged to act as coeditor of the journal for thirteen years, and I am delighted that the present issue should be ex- pressly devoted to a theme that greatly preoccupied me in my thinking, teaching, and writing at Chicago: "Revelation and History." All three of the essayists are valued friends. But I must resist the temp- tation to dwell on our personal relationships. The design of the confer- ence would be defeated if I failed to direct my remarks strictly ad rem. I myself proposed the theme of the conference to Dean Gilpin, adding the explanation already quoted by one of the lecturers: "The theologian in me has always been convinced that there cannot be a theology without a secure concept of revelation, while the historian in me whispers back that revelation is in serious trouble and has been since the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries." If it is to be clear where my replies to the three essays are coming from, I should begin by explaining the explanation, which, as it stands, is perhaps a little cryptic. What do I understand to be the concept of revelation that is in trouble? And if some concept of revelation is nonetheless indispensable to the theo- logical enterprise, how might we go about rethinking the old one? Obvi- ously, if I am to move on as quickly as possible to the contributions of the three lecturers, I must be brief in outlining my answers to these two preliminary questions. Though I follow my usual modus operandi and begin with some historical reflections, nothing so presumptuous as a his- torical survey of the concept of revelation is intended, and I shall not try to review the current literature on the subject. My limited aim is to work toward conceptual clarity on an intricate theological issue and then to offer an indication of my own stand in the fray even if I leave it looking more like a credo than a reasoned case.4 I What we may call (for lack of a better term) the "classical understanding" of revelation is bound up with the notion of a twofold knowledge of God. That there are two sources of religious knowledge, not just one, has been virtually the consensus of Christian theologians throughout the history of the church, but there has been less agreement on what the two sources are and how they are related to each other. Paul's argument in Romans 1-2 has commonly been the scriptural foundation for the discussion, or at least its point of departure. It must suffice for now, however, to start from the well-known formula of a twofold knowledge that divides the 65 4 On most of the matters touched on I have written elsewhere.

Some knowledge of divine things (e.g., that God exists) can be acquired by natural reason, which ascends to them through percep- tion of lower, created things. Other knowledge pertinent to humanity's highest good (e.g., that God is triune) exceeds the capacity of the intellect, but the divine truth in such matters descends in the mode of revelation, yielding the knowledge of faith. Revelation, then, is the supernatural communication of truths inaccessible to natural cognition, and its subjec- tive correlate is the faith or belief that assents to it.5 Somewhat different is Martin Luther's twofold knowledge of God, gen- eral and special.6 If the Thomistic version of a rational knowledge of di- vine things traces its lineage back to the natural theology of Plato and Aris- totle, Luther's notion of a general knowledge of God has affinities rather with the Stoic tradition of natural religion, on which the Apostle Paul him- self drew in Romans 1-2. Thomas's rational route to a limited knowledge of God was open only to a few: even the things demonstrable by reason must be taken on faith by those of us (the vast majority) who lack the talent, time, or energy for rational inquiry.' Luther's general knowledge, by contrast, is the possession of all. And it is Luther's version of the two- fold knowledge of God that is formalized in seventeenth-century Protes- tant scholasticism as the contrast between general revelation and special revelation: the distinction is not drawn, as in Thomas, between a natural knowledge and a revealed knowledge but between two kinds of revela- tion. There is an innate notion of God, closely connected with the voice of conscience, that assumes definite characteristics by observation of God's self-disclosure in the created order, including human nature. But it is insufficient for salvation because the good pleasure of God cannot be grasped apart from God's communication in Scripture.8 On either view, 5 Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra Gentiles, bk. 1, chaps. 3, 9; bk. 4, chap. 1. In the fourth book Thomas actually writes of a threefold knowledge of things divine, adding to the two mentioned the knowledge reserved for the eschatological vision. 6 Martin Luther, In epistolam S.

Hereafter WA. 7Aquinas, Summa contra Gentiles, bk. 1, chap. 4; cf Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, Iaq. 1, a.1. 8 The terms vary: sometimes the contrast is between natural and supernatural revelation, sometimes between general and special revelation, and sometimes there seems to be a slight hesitation to call "revelation" what is given naturally and to all. With special and supernatu- ral revelation, David Hollaz, for instance, contrasts the general revelation or natural manifes- tation by which God makes himself known both through the innate light of nature and through effects conspicuous in the kingdom of nature. See Heinrich Schmid, The Doctrinal Theology of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, 3d ed., trans. Charles A. Hay and Henry E. Jacobs (Minneapolis: Augsburg, 1961), p. 26.

This remained the understanding of faith and revelation that was taken for granted throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. John Locke, for instance, defined faith as "the Assent to any Proposition, not ... made out by the Deductions of Reason; but upon the Credit of the Proposer, as coming from GOD, in some extraordinary way of Commu- nication."9 It is not difficult to see why this notion ran into "serious trou- ble" in the Age of Reason. The story, in its main outlines, is well known. Naturally, the problem was perceived as one side of the struggle against heteronomous authority. But it was the coincidence of three other devel- opments that gave the controversy the precise form it took: revulsion against all the bitter and often bloody conflicts within Christendom, in- creasing knowledge of a sophisticated religious world beyond Chris- tendom, and a new understanding of the natural causes of events once supposed to be brought about by divine or demonic intervention. The very concept of revelation came under fire, and the beginnings of a histori- cal approach to Scripture heightened the conflict by submitting the cre- dentials of the Christian revelation in particular to relentless criticism. For even if the idea of revelation could be made coherent in principle, it still had to be asked whether a revelation had in fact occurred in Christianity (or in any other historical religion). Already in seventeenth-century England we find early traces of an as- tonishing reversal of the prevailing view that the insufficiency of natural revelation made a special revelation of God imperative. In Lord Herbert's judgment, the true "Catholic Church," outside of which there is indeed no salvation, is constituted by certain common notions of religion (five in all) accessible to everyone in every time and place. Any particular "church" (i.e., historical religion) must permit its claims to be assessed by these common notions.'0 Herbert's position did not exclude revelation. But revelation had to be either universal or private, not the imposition of one contentious group on all humanity. Herbert tells us in his autobi- ography how he himself prayed for a sign when trying to decide whether or not to print his book on truth. His prayer was rewarded with "a loud light of nature and the works of creation and providence" is apparently contrasted with God's revelation of himself. 9 John Locke, An Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690), ed.

That, presumably, was a notable example of private reve- lation. Early in the following century, the notion of a normative, rational, uni- versally accessible essence of religion was supplemented with an interest- ing psychological account of religious zeal. Ardent conviction is no guar- antee that one has been exclusively favored with a revelation and is obliged to pass it on to others. New medical theories suggested other possible explanations. Hobbes had already revived the ancient the- ory that fear creates the gods-"in the ignorance of causes," as Hobbes could now add in an age of scientific progress." Making good use of Robert Burton's pioneering study of melancholy, John Trenchard car- ried on the diagnostic approach to religion. Not knowing the natural causes of things, we are inclined to mistake the phantasms of our own imagination for real beings, and so we become easy prey to the imposi- tions of charlatans, who claim to be privy to knowledge that we our- selves lack. Trenchard was particularly fascinated by the case of the "enthusiast" who, feeling a storm of devotion coming upon him, sup- poses himself graced with a supernatural revelation. His inflexible tem- per and refusal to hear any criticism of his opinions could be due, in actual fact, to an excess of black bile ("melancholy") in his system: "The Enthusiast is only intoxicated with Vapours ascending from the lower Regions of his Body."'2 Like many others of his time, Trenchard thought that a rational religion, which improved the faculties, was entirely pos- sible,'3 and he was careful to identify as his target only the fringe enthu- siast. But I doubt if he failed to notice the symptoms of bilious disposi- tions in the heated squabbles of mainline Anglicans and Presbyterians as well. The troubled concept of revelation became the center of the so-called Deist Controversy, commonly said to have been launched by John To- land's Christianity Not Mysterious.'" Revelation, he argued, is not mysteri- ous: reason is everyone's implement for comprehending it. It does not follow that revelation is unnecessary, only that we do not need clergymen and divinity schools to confuse us about it. In Christianity as Old as the Creation,'5 the work dubbed "the Deists' Bible," Matthew Tindal took the 68 " Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), ed.

And this, of course, leaves us wondering (despite Toland's assurances) why revelation is needed-indeed, whether it is simply an invented means of priestly control and the cause of endless dissension that obscures the purity of natural religion. The most Tindal is willing to concede (in his conclusion) is that some forms of ecclesiastical piety may have an instrumental worth in promoting the religion of reason.'6 Reason is the actual source of what- ever religious truth we have and therefore the critical means for de- termining how much truth there is in any instituted religion, including Christianity. Special revelation in the traditional sense, Thomistic or Lu- theran, has been dissolved. Reversal of the old superordination of Scripture to reason invited a thoroughgoing critical reappraisal of the entire Bible. A direct assault was made on what had been the two main weapons in the Christian apolo- getic arsenal since Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14-36): the fulfillment of prophecy and the occurrence of miracles. The details cannot be allowed to detain me. I must simply sum up by answering my first question, Why is revelation, as traditionally understood, a problem for historical thinking? The answer is that to view Christianity in histori- cal perspective is to set it in a larger historical context, to see it as one religion among others, and that means reading the Bible with the same critical eye that we bring to our reading of any other book, sacred or secular. From a strictly historical point of view, there can be no reason to grant privileged status to Christian claims or Christian literature, even though we may have a special interest in them simply because they are part of our history. On the contrary, the task will be to bring any religious claims whatever under the scrutiny of commonly accepted standards of inquiry. And this, as no one has seen more clearly than Ernst Troeltsch, is to remove Christian revelation entirely from the domain of the "super- natural" (as usually understood). The temptation is always present, of course, to move from antisupernaturalism to naturalistic reductionism. But a realistic account of religious experience is not necessarily excluded by historical thinking: faith may be examined, at least hypothetically, as a response to a transcendent reality. What is excluded in principle is any untested assumption at the outset that Christianity is distinguished from all other religions as the sole recipient of an authoritative revelation, or 16 Immanuel Kant, who was well acquainted with Tindal's work, took up an instrumental understanding of positive religion in Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blo,3en Vernunft (1793).

But I must press on and give some indication of where I myself stand in the debate on revelation and history opened up by the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century critiques. It will surprise no one who knows me if I take my bearings from two of my favorite theologians, John Calvin and Friedrich Schleiermacher. I understand dogmatic theology, as distinct from "historical theology" (in the usual sense), to be tradition-specific: it entails a prima facie duty to explore (not to absolutize) the beliefs, rituals, symbols, and institutions of the tradition in which the dogmatic theologian stands.'8 The fact that I consider myself a debtor to Schleiermacher as well as Calvin may be enough to attest that I do not take my Reformed tradition to be static or exclusive and that I am not confronted with the grim choice between unhistorical repristination of a selected moment or outright renunciation of the whole tradition. But what help can be expected from Calvin, who came before the sev- enteenth- and eighteenth-century debate on revelation? The answer is that one strand in his understanding of revelation was free from a key assumption shared by the protagonists on both sides, deist and orthodox alike: that by "revelation," whether it occurs or not, is meant the giving of information to be accepted by intellectual assent or belief. The content of special revelation, taken in this sense, is formally analogous to what is presumed to be given by general revelation-the religion of reason or of nature. Eighteenth-century theologians and their deist opponents typi- cally thought of natural religion as a prisca theologia, an original or primi- tive "theology," reducible to a short list of propositions. Special revelation was supposed to extend the list. It was also the shared assumption of both parties that to defend either the shorter or the longer list was to show the 17 It may not be superfluous to add that the point is a purely methodological one: it does not imply endorsement of any particular seventeenth- or eighteenth-century interpretation either of religion or of Christianity. 18 Schleiermacher, as is well known, classified dogmatics itself as a part of "historical theol- ogy." His reasons were perceptive but have persuaded hardly anyone to adopt his defini- tions. Schleiermacher also preferred the term Glaubenslehre to Dogmatik, and once again he had good reasons. But I myself obstinately retain the term "dogmatics" (or "dogmatic theology") because, like Schleiermacher, I take the subject matter of the discipline to be the faith of the church, which in the Reformed tradition is embodied in the church's confes- sions. Admittedly, the confessions are less than dogmas, but "dogmatics" conveys better than "systematic theology" or Glaubenslehre the ecclesial anchorage of the discipline. 70</page><page sequence="8">A Provisional Response social utility of the beliefs proposed, that is, their effectiveness in making solid citizens. It is not difficult to find statements in Calvin that share the understand- ing of revelation as informative. The Scriptures, he believed, communi- cate facts or truths we could not possibly have known without revelation even if Adam had never fallen, for example, that the work of creation took six days. Here revelation is information not otherwise available, im- parted in a supernatural manner-in the example given, by God's speak- ing to Moses, who wrote it down. But Calvin could also say that the Scrip- tures are like a pair of spectacles by which we are enabled to view the world with a clearer vision, to see things as Adam must have seen them before disobedience clouded his eyesight. From this perspective, revela- tion is not supernaturally conveyed information but divinely improved vision.19 It is of course true that what Calvin had in mind when he used the simile of the spectacles was knowledge of God the Creator: the Scriptures are like corrective lenses insofar as they enable us to discover the true God in nature. I am not at all pretending to offer a comprehensive ac- count of his doctrine of the word of God, merely suggesting that the sim- ile gives us an important clue to the way in which we might try to rethink the old idea of revelation. It is worth noting, however, that when he comes to the knowledge of God the Redeemer, Calvin defines faith, the correlate of revelation, as "recognition," not as assent or belief. What faith recog- nizes in the course of events is a fatherlike goodwill or, more simply, the "face" of God.20 The recognition happens initially in the proclamation and hearing of the "promise," the special form of revelation in which Calvin was most interested. But the faith born of the word or promise subsequently shapes the way the believer perceives her entire life.21 We are surely justified in concluding that the gospel story, too (the historia evangelica, as he called it), functioned for Calvin as a lens that enabled him to make out the paternal image in a narrative of obedience, suffering, and death, and to transfer this disclosure to the whole of Christian existence. If, then, Calvin's simile of the spectacles invites a revised definition of revelation as counterpart of the old one, it will go something like this: By "revelation" is meant a disclosive moment that focuses our perception of ourselves and our world, and 'faith" is the insight that corresponds to this disclosure. That some such rethinking of the concepts of revelation and faith is sound will 19 See my first epigraph and the reference in n. 1 above. Notice that the "volume" in Calvin's simile is the book of nature; it is not Scripture, which provides, rather, the corrective lenses for reading it. 20 Calvin, Institutio (n. 1 above), 3.2.2., 14, 16, 28. 21 Ibid., 3.2.8; cf. 2.29-30. 71</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion have to be made "secure" by experience: that is, by noting what seems actually to happen when someone goes to church, hears a sermon, and finds her way of seeing the world and living in the world decisively shaped by the disclosure and insight given in the word. It will also need to be established that revelation in the revised sense is free from the objections that made the old concept unworkable. And a moment's reflection will show that revelation understood as an occasion of disclosure and insight does not occur only in church on Sunday morning and is not mediated solely by Scripture or preaching, or even by words. The concept may be taken as broad and generic, not designed to set the Christian proclama- tion apart. We must certainly be willing to ask, Why, then, this revelation rather than another? And how do we know that our supposed insight is not an illusion? But the concept of revelation, as revised with Calvin's help, is not as such greatly problematic, or at least not problematic in the same way as the old one; and that is all I am concerned to maintain for the present.22 I cannot hope to give a balanced account of Schleiermacher's contribu- tion any more than Calvin's. But I do not need to: Walter Wyman has already done so, and I shall be responding to him in due course. It will be enough, for now, to indicate where I think Schleiermacher furthers the discussion and where I think he invites dissent. It was his great merit not to introduce the category of revelation simply in order to remove Christianity at the outset from the company of other religions. In The Christian Faith he speaks, like the orthodox Protestant divines, of a general divine manifestation in human nature and the order of creation. But, unlike them, he introduces special revelation as a generic concept that denotes the originating moment in every historical religion, Christianity included-with the qualification I must address later. Working with the old contrast between general and special revelation, he sets it in the new context of religious pluralism and historical understanding. (Whether he keeps it there is the question to which I shall have to return in my response to Wyman.) To this extent, I think Schleiermacher's discussion marks a 22 Some readers of this highly condensed account may be helped to learn that, in addition to the clue I took from Calvin's simile of the spectacles, I was influenced in seminary (1952- 55) by John Oman's view of religious cognition as a mode of interpretation-a view devel- oped in the first book I ever reviewed, John Hick's Faith and Knowledge: A Modern Introduction to the Problem of Religious Knowledge (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1957). I was also impressed-charmed even-by the perceptive account of disclosure situations in Ian T. Ramsey, Religious Language: An Empirical Placing of Theological Phrases (London: SCM, 1957). Only after my Warfield Lectures (1994) did I read, on the recommendation of good friends, H. Richard Niebuhr's The Meaning ofRevelation (1941; reprint, New York: Macmillan, 1960), where I was delighted to find revelation in our history defined as "that special occasion which provides us with an image by means of which all the occasions of personal and com- mon life become intelligible" (p. 80). 72</page><page sequence="10">A Provisional Response necessary advance over what must strike us, with the wisdom of hind- sight, as the parochialism of Calvin. It will be obvious, however, that in defining the faith that corresponds to revelation as "discernment," "recognition," or "insight," I am working with cognitive categories such as Schleiermacher deliberately avoided in specifying the content of general revelation, which, for him, was given in the "feeling" of absolute dependence. And I must also dissent when he excludes moral categories as well from this "original revelation," as he calls it. The exclusion seems all the more remarkable when he tells us later- much later!-that conscience, too, is an original revelation of God.23 In any case, I have sought in my own dogmatic efforts to keep the idea of general revelation closer to the moral understanding of it in the older dogmatic tradition, including Calvin. To put it in my own terms: discern- ment situations that are properly termed "general revelation" stir our awareness of living in an ordered world, which, at least in our small cor- ner, is a moral order that confronts us as a task or demand.24 I have ar- gued that this awareness, which I call "elemental faith" and take to be the counterpart of an elemental concept of God, is "secure" insofar as order is the presupposition of all scientific inquiry and moral order is presup- posed in all our everyday discourse about right and wrong. While the spectacles of special revelation-for Christians, the historia evangelica- may be said to focus this awareness, the awareness given in general revela- tion is self-evidently the condition for the possibility of the special revela- tion that brings it to a focus. From these remarks about the shortcomings of the classical idea of rev- elation and a possible way of revising it, the main lines of my response to Van Harvey and Bruce McCormack can readily be anticipated. For if I cannot see Deus dixit as the distinguishing characteristic of the Christian witness (Karl Barth), I am not persuaded that all talk of revelation is illusion (Ludwig Feuerbach). My response to Wyman is bound to be more complicated precisely because we are very nearly agreed, but not quite. 23 Interestingly, perhaps misleadingly, Schleiermacher describes as urspriingliche Offenbar- ung (1) the universally human revelation given in the structure of consciousness, (2) the general revelation in nature, (3) the revelation in conscience, and (4) the particular histori- cal revelation in Jesus of Nazareth. See, respectively, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsatzen der evangelischen Kirche im Zusammenhange dargestellt (hereafter Gl.), 7th ed., based on the 2d ed. (1830-31), ed. Martin Redeker, 2 vols. (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1960), sec. 4.4; Schleiermachers Sendschreiben iiber seine Glaubenslehre an Luicke (1829), ed. Hermann Mulert (Giessen: Alfred T6pelmann [J. Ricker], 1908), p. 57; GlI., sec. 83.1; Gl., sec. 103.2 (twice). In all four contexts, "original" means, I take it, not accidental but grounded in the divinely ordained way things are. 24 I find Ramsey's way of describing the empirical anchorage of religious language espe- cially apt: "'Conscience' (for Butler), the 'Moral Law' (for Kant) and 'Duty' (for Ross) are close logical kinsmen to the theologian's 'God,' and give good approximations to its logical placing" (p. 31). 73</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion III No one in our day has probed more relentlessly than Van Harvey the nagging questions that cluster around the theme of faith and history. His book The Historian and the Believer (first published in 1966) has been hailed with good reason as a twentieth-century theological classic. In the intro- duction to the new edition, he still asserts that biblical criticism, especially research into the historical Jesus, is a skeleton in the closet of Christian theology and adds: "The history of theology since the middle of the nine- teenth century may be seen as a series of unsuccessful salvage operations mounted to deal with this problem."25 Much of the mid-nineteenth- century furor over faith and history was of course precipitated by D. E Strauss. In his more recent work, however, Harvey has moved on, so to say, to another left-wing Hegelian: from Strauss to Feuerbach.26 Strictly speaking, the focus shifts from revelation and history to revelation and naturalistic reductionism. But it was the purpose of our conference on "Revelation and History" to explore the history of the idea of revelation as well as the conceptual problems of revelation and historical thinking. Perhaps remembering that I was once considered a Luther scholar, Har- vey makes his contribution to our theme by looking into Feuerbach's os- tensibly historical claim that Martin Luther's doctrine of revelation was wholly on his side. If Harvey is correct, Feuerbach's appeal to Luther was something more than window dressing. In any case, in 1844 Feuerbach was developing a new interpretation of religion. The central theme of The Essence of Chris- tianity (1841) had been "projection": the mechanism by which the charac- teristics of the human species are objectified in the idea of God.27 Soon after writing the book that made him famous, Feuerbach became more preoccupied with the inner drive that turns a person to belief in God. There is a double shift, we might say: from the human species to the individual, and from a psychological mechanism to motivation. The Es- sence of Faith according to Luther (1844) falls into the transitional stage of Feuerbach's thinking, between The Essence of Christianity and his Lectures on the Essence of Religion (1848),28 the time when he was exploring the evi- 25 Van A.

Harvey, Feuerbach and the Interpretation of Religion (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1995), is a study fully worthy of his earlier book and likely to be as widely dis- cussed. 27 Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity (first published in German, 1841), trans.

For the revelation of God is the Incarnation, which is the visible proof that God is God "for us" or "for me" (pro nobis, pro me) and takes away the limits by which nature obstructs our blessedness, including the ultimate limit: death.30 Thus the essence of faith according to Luther was in effect the desire for blessed- ness, or the love of each individual for herself. Most of us, I suspect, shudder when we read the coup de grace: the quotation in which Luther expressly points out that concern for others is a small thing in comparison with our own salvation.3' We are reminded of the Calvinist (well, Puritan!) counterpart: Max Weber's citation of the place in John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (pt. 1, 1678) where Christian stuffs his fingers in his ears, so as not to hear the entreaty of his wife and children, and runs off toward the celestial city crying, "Life! Life! Eternal Life!"32 Feuerbach's argument in The Essence of Faith according to Luther is not that Luther's mentality was peculiarly his own but that it exemplified with uncommon clarity Christian faith in general. "Luther was the first to let out the secret of Christian faith."33 Indeed, he gave away the secret of religion. Was Feuerbach right about Luther? And was he right about religion? Obviously, I cannot offer more than a comment or two on each question. The Luther book is hardly to be judged as an academic contribution to the history of theology, and it is perhaps beside the point to rummage for countercitations in "the great Pandora's Box" of the Weimar Edition, as Karl Barth called it,34 to prove that Feuerbach's case was tendentious. Still, something needs to be said for the sake of our conversation on reve- lation and history. Actually, Feuerbach's thoughts on the role of Sinnlich- keit in Luther's theology (the Luther scholars might prefer to say Leiblich- keit) were by no means wrongheaded; they would be confirmed by a closer 29 I take this definition of the felicity principle from Harvey's book (Feuerbach, p. 69). 30 Feuerbach did not think Protestantism was very good at achieving this aim. On Luther's own testimony, evangelical sermons actually increased the fear of death, changing an acute evil, Feuerbach comments, into a chronic one. See Feuerbach, "Comments upon Some Re- markable Statements by Luther" (1844), in Feuerbach, The Essence of Faith according to Luther (hereafter Luther), trans. Melvin Cherno (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967), p. 127. 31 Harvey quotes from the English translation in Feuerbach, Luther, p. 101. 32 Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, trans.

But his interpretation of the Lutheran pro me needs correction. Three qualifications are called for. First, while the pro me may some- times have nurtured an egocentric piety by which self-love has been ex- tended rather than cured, its original function was to assure the individ- ual that she was not excluded from God's love for the world. First-person pronouns are commonplace in evangelical hymn books, but Luther un- derstood well that, in his day, many with troubled consciences found it hard to use the first person at all-hard to be persuaded that God's love includes me.35 Second, the pro me did not prevent him from identifying self-love as the essence not of faith but of sin,36 and he could warn his pastoral charges that God receives his glory only when I put his Kingdom first, not desiring it for the sake of my own blessedness but finding my blessedness in commitment to his Kingdom.37 Third, it was precisely the thought that "God takes care of me" that, in Luther's view, freed the Christian for her neighbor. Feuerbach does not fairly represent the se- quence: first faith, then love. It does not mean that I am more important than my neighbor; it means that eternal blessedness is both more impor- tant than earthly happiness and, in addition, the unfailing spring of lov- ing action in the temporal domain since I am available to others only when I am no longer consumed with anxiety about myself or my standing before God.38 In short, what Luther heard in the word of God-God's revelation-was a good deal more than can be subsumed under the felic- ity principle. Feuerbach's reading of Luther went with the new theory of religion that was to be presented in the Lectures on the Essence of Religion. There it is asserted more explicitly that the felicity principle is the fertile soil of wishful thinking in religion.39 That God exists for me means that God does not really exist: I am just imagining and inventing the God I wish for. My imagination, driven by the desire for blessedness, helps me come 5 See, e.g., Luther, Der ProphetJona ausgelegt (1526), WA (n. 6 above), 19:206. The ques- tion is not, as Feuerbach supposes (Luther, p. 64), whether God is really good, but whether God's goodness is for me. 36 Most notably in Luther's Romerbriefvorlesung (1515-16), to which Feuerbach would not have had access. 37 Luther, Eine kurze und gute Auslegung des Vaterunsers vor sich und hinter sich (1519), WA, 6:21-22. 38 For this fundamental Lutheran insight, one need look no further than Luther's De libertate christiana (1520). Feuerbach does not quite get the point when he concedes that I must care for myself before I can care for others (Luther, p. 102). But that is close! And he also recognizes that, in Luther's scheme, I wish blessedness for others as well as myself (p. 115). 39 Hints of this reduction of faith to illusion will be found already in Feuerbach's Luther book: Luther, pp. 76, 79n., 95, 102-4, 112. "God is a blank tablet on which there is nothing written but what you yourself have written" (p. 107). 76</page><page sequence="14">A Provisional Response to terms with the mysterious powers of nature by personalizing them, making them able to meet my needs. Harvey thinks this offers a more convincing critique of religion than the earlier projection theory. But the limitations of the theory are evident: it works better with some kinds of religious experience than with others. Feuerbach's thinking was shaped more than he realized by the religion closest to home. A strong aversion to Protestant pietism made its appearance already in Feuerbach's early work, Thoughts on Death and Immortality (1830).40 Pietism, he believed, makes each person in her individuality the center of her own attention. Apparently he read Luther one-sidedly because he ransacked the Reformer's writings, especially his sermons and postils, only for more evidence of Protestant egocentrism-at its source. But it was a further mistake if he supposed that this gave him a theory of religion. There are religions that do not reassure us that everything is as we wish it to be but admonish us to adjust ourselves to the way things inevitably are; and the function of religion has sometimes been to counter the individual's de- sires, wishes, and self-seeking with a moral demand that can hardly be construed as the product of physical nature. It is the sense of a moral order that leads the religious consciousness to represent the subject of revela- tion (the Revealer) as a commanding will. As he tells us himself, Harvey learned of such a "profound faith" from his Calvinist father.4' But I do not see how his Feuerbach could incorporate it into his theory of religion. IV On the whole, nineteenth-century theologians seem to have worried less about Feuerbach than about Strauss. That may well be the right choice. But it may also indicate more than a little theological myopia. The most influential Protestant theologian at the end of the century, Albrecht Ritschl, offered a theory of religion that would have delighted Feuerbach: "In every religion what is sought, with the help of the superhuman spiri- tual power reverenced by man, is a solution of the contradiction in which man finds himself, as both a part of the world of nature and a spiritual personality claiming to dominate nature."42 It was to Luther's idea of the 40 Ludwig Feuerbach, Thoughts on Death and Immortality (1830), trans. James A. Massey (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980). 41 Harvey, The Historian and the Believer (n. 25 above), p. xiv. It was characteristic of Calvin to insist that "the devout mind does not dream up for itself any God it pleases"; it takes God as he reveals (manifestat) himself and is careful not to step beyond his will (Calvin, Institutio [n. 1 above], 1.2.2). 42 Albrecht Ritschl, The Christian Doctrine of ustification and Reconciliation: The Positive Devel- opment of the Doctrine, trans.

But if that is a move in the right direction, Ritschl runs back into Feuerbach's open arms when he adds that moral conduct is not disinterested: "The vital point is that one realises as one's own interest the interest of others to whom the service is rendered."45 We owe it to Karl Barth more than anyone else that in the middle third of our own century revelation was reaffirmed as a word of God to which our thinking and living must be conformed. This is not to imply that no one in the first third of the century protested against theologies that mea- sure doctrines by their efficiency in satisfying the needs of the day. But the champions of an objective revelation were prone to compromise their case by identifying revelation with an infallible book, and the weight of historical-critical study of the Bible increasingly went against them.46 Protestant seminarians of my generation discovered in Barth and Emil Brunner a view of Scripture as fallible human witness to the word of God in Jesus Christ, and it seemed all the more persuasive to us because it was represented as the real understanding of Scripture (appearances some- times to the contrary!) in the Protestant Reformers, especially Luther. Deus dixit and Paulus dixit, we learned, are two different things. I think it is fair to say that we read Barth and Brunner (especially Brunner) in those days as mediating theologians in the Reformed tradi- tion. But we also learned that the place of Schleiermacher in the tradition was more than dubious. As the strident criticisms of Schleiermacher in- creased, so also did my regard for him. Hence I welcome Bruce McCor- mack's groundbreaking work on Barth, which not only calls for conversa- 43 But Ritschl regrets that Luther's notion of "positive world-dominating freedom" in De libertate christiana was wholly overshadowed in his later writings by the "negative sense of freedom from the law and from sin" (ibid., p. 181). 44 Ibid., pp. 211-12; cf. Feuerbach, Luther (n. 30 above), p. 51. 45 A. Ritschl, p. 206. 46 An instructive illustration of the party lines in America at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century appeared in three contributions to the American Journal of Theology (14 [1910]: 192-233) on the theme "The Task and Method of Systematic Theology." The right and left wings were represented, respectively, by Benjamin B. Warfield (Princeton) and Ger- ald Birney Smith (Chicago), while William Adam Brown (Union, New York) took the Ritschlian middle and argued for Christianity on grounds of experience, not of an a priori claim to supernatural revelation. 78</page><page sequence="16">A Provisional Response tion between the Barthians and the Schleiermacherians but also sees the respective heroes of each party standing in the same mediating tradition, Reformed or not. This, of course, does not mean glossing over the break with "liberalism" that McCormack documents in his formidable study of Barth's theological progress.47 But, as his elegant contribution to our con- ference makes clear, he is convinced that even after the break Barth was dealing with nineteenth-century problems and, up to a point, drawing on nineteenth-century solutions. In particular, Barth, like Schleiermacher before him, tried to formulate a doctrine of revelation that did not ques- tion Kant's limitation of theoretical knowing to what is "intuitable." His theology was in this respect, as in others, not so much neoorthodox as modern: a theology of mediation and correlation. However much I welcome McCormack's placement of Barth in the his- tory of modern theology, I know he will not be surprised when I voice misgiving about what he sees as Barth's contribution to our theme. Noth- ing is to be gained by laboring the point McCormack freely admits: Kant would not be impressed by the argument that God makes Godself intuit- able in the Incarnation without surrendering the unintuitability proper to God since God's hidden presence in the life of Jesus can be recognized only as the Holy Spirit gives us eyes to see.48 But one may well question the wisdom of solving an eighteenth-century problem by repeating sixteenth- and seventeenth-century formulas that had come under sharp attack in Kant's day. Schleiermacher, by contrast, conceded the Neolo- gists' criticisms of the inherited christological dogmas and tried to rethink what it might mean to confess that God was in Christ without the scholas- tic abstractions, which, he believed, lost contact with the language of faith.49 (It is no accident that the "Reformed version of an anhypostatic- enhypostatic Christology" never found its way into the confessions of the 47 Bruce L. McCormack, Karl Barth's Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology: Its Genesis and Development, 1909-1936 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), the first of two volumes planned, clearly provides the benchmark for any further discussions of Barth's early career. 48 I take the formulation of Barth's G6ttingen dogmatics (1924-25). See Karl Barth, The Gdttingen Dogmatics: Instruction in the Christian Religion, trans. Geoffrey W. Bromiley (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1990), 1:331-35. As McCormack shows, in Karl Barth's second R6merbrief (1922), God's revelation-the point of intersection between two worlds-is the Resurrection understood as an event without extension. See Karl Barth, The Epistle to the Romans, translated from the 6th ed. by Edwin C. Hoskins (London: Oxford University Press, 1933), pp. 29-31. 49 One reason why McCormack does not speak of Schleiermacher's christology is that his point of comparison is Schleiermacher on the independence of general revelation and Barth on the independence of special revelation. It goes without saying that a great deal more could be said about Kant's own thoughts on God, Christ, and revelation in Die Religion (n. 16 above) and in his Vorlesungen iiber die philosophische Religionslehre (published posthumously in 1817; 2d ed., Leipzig, 1830). McCormack (p. 21, in this issue) will surely agree that we are not yet done with Kant when we say that he "reduced God to a regulative idea wholly lacking in content." 79</page><page sequence="17">The Journal of Religion church!) "Correlation" usually requires something more than the juxta- position of the old and the new, neither one undergoing change. I am struck by the number of "if-then" sentences in McCormack's presentation. They may suffice to show the coherence of what is being said. But can they reassure the reader that she is confronted with something more than an astute dialectical exercise? The Barthian riposte, no doubt, is that in Christian dogmatics the fact of revelation precedes any inquiry into its possibility. The Deus dixit is given, and so is the identity of God's life with the life of Jesus, which is the form of revelation. To ask how it is possible is not to ask whether it is possible or to reconsider our axiomatic starting point in God's becoming human. That would be to forsake the discipline of church dogmatics. For my part, I have no doubt that a lot of good theology is done from this standpoint, and I continue to learn from the greatest Protestant theologian of our century (taking a little quiet satisfaction in the thought that he came from the Reformed family). But what the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century critics of orthodoxy were saying, it seems to me, is that only our provin- cialism has prevented us from facing a larger fact: that there are, as Troeltsch puts it, several nodal points in the history of humanity's en- counter with transcendence, not one absolute center.50 Once Christian theologians fully acknowledge this fact, it is bound to make a difference to the way they go about their business, not least to the way in which they think of revelation. We still need a (posthumous) debate between Barth and Troeltsch. On that I agree entirely with McCormack,51 and it brings me to the third and last part of my response. V I have left until last some rather more detailed comments on Walter Wy- man's essay. He sees the problem of revelation and history much as I see it, and he adds a hint at the direction he thinks we ought to take in our attempt to solve it. Wyman and I have some historical interests in com- mon; our lists of favorite authors overlap, though they do not quite coin- cide. I cannot recall him ever having anything very enthusiastic to say about Luther or Calvin (just a memory lapse perhaps), but, like myself, he is irresistibly drawn to Friedrich Schleiermacher and Ernst Troeltsch and the manner in which they framed our question. It is not surprising 80 50 Ernst Troeltsch, Die Bedeutung der Geschichtlichkeit Jesufiir den Glauben (Tiibingen: JCB Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1911), pp. 15, 22. 51 We cannot start the debate now, but I do not think Troeltsch's principle of correlation is a mere dogma (see McCormack's n. 43, in this issue). True, it is not exhaustively testable by historical method, but Troeltsch's point is that it is presupposed by historical method in the sense that it is implicit in the way modern historians actually do their work.</page><page sequence="18">A Provisional Response that, after a telling epigraph from Schleiermacher (and an elegant posing of the apparent polar opposition between Wolfhart Pannenberg and Gor- don Kaufman), he launches into a masterly exposition and critique of Schleiermacher's and Troeltsch's thoughts on revelation. Roughly speak- ing, he prefers Schleiermacher on general revelation, Troeltsch on histor- ical revelation, and judges Schleiermacher's contribution more "secure" than Troeltsch's. With respect to Christian belief in a special revelation in Jesus Christ, he ends on a largely negative note. Not even Troeltsch succeeded in saving it. Wyman remains either uncertain or too polite to say forthrightly whether the flaws he discovers in Schleiermacher's and Troeltsch's views on historical revelation are, in the end, fatal also to mine. It is with his interpretation of Schleiermacher and Troeltsch, then, and my own estimate of their positions that I wish to conclude my response. As Wyman no doubt anticipated, I hesitate to follow him in his apparent reduction of special to general revelation,52 even though my thoughts and his reflect much the same conceptual framework. Wyman is sympathetic, as am I, to Schleiermacher's understanding of universal revelation in the second of the Speeches on Religion, which he cites in the first edition.53 I think he is right in his interesting verdict that Troeltsch, who internalized general revelation as the inward connection of the divine and human spirits, failed to improve on Schleiermacher's notion of the self-revelation of "the Universe" in every outward event. Religion, Schleiermacher tells us, is grasping everything individual as part of the Whole, and any fresh, original intuition of the Whole is prop- erly termed a "revelation" inasmuch as it is the work of the unceasing activity of the Universe on us. But the way in which one expresses the revelation, or conceptualizes its source as "God," depends on the individ- ual imagination. Wyman likes this line of thought, which leads later, in Schleiermacher's The Christian Faith, to the identification of the feeling of absolute dependence as an original revelation of God. He finds it attrac- tive because it allows for variety in the forms of religious experience, even though the action of the Universe that evokes them is "uniform." On the other hand, he does not endorse Schleiermacher's notion of a historical 52 Wyman's position is reminiscent of Matthew Tindal's estimate of Christianity as a "re- publication" of the religion of nature. But his acknowledged debt is to Schubert Ogden's important notion of "re-presentation." I should note that in my response to Wyman I ven- ture to depart from his use of the qualifier "original." As I have indicated (see n. 23 above), Schleiermacher himself does not confine the term "original revelation" to revelation in hu- man consciousness or in nature. Hence I have reverted to the old antithesis of "general" and "special" revelation, but I also use "universal" to refer more specifically to the general revelation in nature ("the Universe") and "historical" to refer to special revelation in history. 53 Friedrich Schleiermacher, On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers (1799), trans. Richard Crouter, Texts in German Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988). 81</page><page sequence="19">The Journal of Religion revelation in Jesus Christ, foreshadowed in the fifth speech and developed in the introduction to The Christian Faith, because it appears to violate the selfsame principle of cosmic uniformity. It is, in a word, a relic of discred- ited supernaturalism, which attributes two kinds of activity to God: one identical in scope with the orderly progress of the world, the other dis- rupting it. By way of rejoinder to this criticism, more could surely be said in Schleiermacher's defense-whether or not the more is sufficient to make his understanding of God's revelation in Christ a viable option. We need to distinguish his formal description of this (as of all other) revelation from the content he assigns to it. For one might wish to rule out the appearance of a perfect God-consciousness as irreconcilable with histori- cal thinking and yet still argue that the founding event of Christianity was a distinctive revelation of God in Jesus of Nazareth. In itself, the notion of an original fact that lies at the foundation of a religious community is presumably unexceptionable. Even Troeltsch's principles of criticism, analogy, and correlation did not prevent him from acknowledging genu- ine novelty in the historical process. The difficulty, however, is that Schleiermacher undermines his own generic concept of revelation by his refusal to leave Jesus as revealer in the same class as Moses and Moham- med. The appearance of the Redeemer expressly annuls the principle of analogy. Schleiermacher would reply, I think: But so does the creation of the world, which, in the eternal purpose of God, includes the sending of the Redeemer. What is supernatural about the appearance of the Redeemer is that it results, not from an unparalleled divine intervention in the flow of history, but from God's one eternal "decree." The decree to send Christ forth is one with the decree to create the human race. The supernatural in Christ is therefore not referred to a temporal act of God; it belongs rather to the timeless divine causality, in which creation and redemption coincide. The Incarnation is the reason why everything in nature is as it is. If, then, creation may be said to be supernatural, or without analogy, so must the appearance of the Redeemer, which is the completion of the creation of humanity and holds the meaning of creation in itself. Hence Schleiermacher can say, in impeccably orthodox language: "In truth, he [Christ] alone mediates ... all revelation of God through the world."54 Still, though I think more needs to be said about Schleiermacher's "su- pernaturalism," I do not disagree with Wyman's preference for Troeltsch on historical revelation. I concede that Schleiermacher's identification of Christian revelation with the historical appearance of a perfect God- 82 54 Schleiermacher, Gl. (n. 23 above), sec. 94.2.</page><page sequence="20">A Provisional Response consciousness cannot stand up to the criticisms of historically minded theologians such as F. C. Baur, Strauss, and Troeltsch. I even concede, a bit more reluctantly, that Schleiermacher's account of what is supernatu- ral about the appearance of the Redeemer, though ingenious and still worthy of consideration, is likely to strike the historically minded as an irrelevant dogmatic ploy. But I am unwilling to infer that a generic con- cept of historical revelation, as revised by Troeltsch, is unworkable, and in general this is Wyman's view, too-with the qualification I must move on to shortly. Schleiermacher defeats his own concept of historical revela- tion by removing Christ from the company of other revealers. Troeltsch retrieves it by assuming that the revelation granted to Jesus is formally analogous to the revelation granted to Moses and Mohammed, whatever differences there undoubtedly are in the content of the messages they communicate. Hence, Wyman decides, Troeltsch's understanding of reve- lation is not, like Schleiermacher's, vulnerable to historical science. Nevertheless, in his concluding section Wyman leaves us with a trouble- some question that jeopardizes the independent viability of any claim to a special, historical revelation and threatens to collapse it into the idea of general revelation. The question has to do with the notion of imaginative construction: not whether but how much the imagination contributes to the interpretation of religious experience. Wyman has no wish to deny cate- gorically that imaginative constructs can have an objective reference, as Schleiermacher and Troeltsch both believed. Here I certainly agree. If the operation of imaginative construction were nonreferential or wholly noncognitive, then the constructs would have the status of pure fictions, generated wholly within the religious subject, and the idea of revelation would simply be out of place: no object would be revealed; subjective creations would be projected into thin air. The only objectivity one might wish to claim for them would not lie in some transcendent divine reality but in the existence of a historical tradition of imaginative construction in a particular religious community; the fictions would be communal or collective fictions. If, however, one takes the constructs to be perspectives ("perspectives on reality" is one of Wyman's expressions), there is no logi- cal reason to exclude the concept of revelation. It is, of course, always possible that the object disclosed is falsely identified by the religious con- sciousness, as the later Feuerbach argued. But this is not the path that Wyman wants to take. VI The issue for Wyman, if I understand him correctly, is not whether the work of the religious imagination can plausibly be taken as a response to the disclosure of ultimate reality. It is whether we can assign any more 83</page><page sequence="21">The Journal of Religion definite content to what is supposedly revealed in history than Schleier- macher assigns to general revelation-which is not much. Wyman remarks on the epistemological modesty of Schleiermacher's theory of revelation in the first edition of the Speeches, and he cites Harvey's remark that the key term Anschauung is compatible with agnosticism about the nature of what is intuited. And the question is, How can we move on from there to Troeltsch's claim that the ongoing career of Christian faith is a fresh, historical revelation and not (as I take Wyman to be asking) simply a developing interpretative perspective on the little that is given in univer- sal revelation? Wyman's answer is, We can't. Why not? Of course, any reve- lation claim whatever is open to questions about its supposedly transcen- dent source. The main difficulty Wyman perceives, however, is that a divine disclosure in history appears to presuppose a special divine activity, and Schleiermacher has taught us that there are no special acts of God. There is only the timeless, spaceless divine activity, which sustains the whole course of nature, and of which we are aware in our intuition of the Whole or in our feeling of absolute dependence. Troeltsch's view of historical revelation, then, may have the merit of not imperiling the principle of analogy, but it is less "secure" than Schleier- macher's conception of general revelation, which at least has the advan- tage of being firmly grounded in an analysis of the universal structure of finite existence and does not postulate any divine activity apart from the regular movement of the Whole. In the end, Schleiermacher's case for general revelation scores highest of all the options because it has two mer- its: it is not on collision course with the historical consciousness, and, more positively, it has a "fair chance" of proving credible when tested by philosophical argument. In sum: Wyman's adroit argument has first let Troeltsch undermine Schleiermacher's concept of historical revelation, then let Schleiermacher, in turn, drastically trim Troeltsch's modification of the same concept. Indeed, it becomes doubtful whether "historical reve- lation" has a proper use at all. Theology had better learn to do without it. All that is left is general revelation-and a human imagination busily generating beliefs and symbols out of the stuff of history while the myste- rious Deity has nothing more to say. For now, I can only contribute two brief comments to this turn in the conversation. They have to do with the two theological criteria Wyman borrows from Schubert Ogden: appropriateness to the normative Chris- tian witness and credibility according to universal conditions of truth. First, while I agree that the notion of particular acts of God in history is improperly anthropomorphic,55 we must look more closely at the assump- 55 See Schleiermacher's succinct proposition on creation in ibid., sec. 41. An "act of God" has been the subject of extensive theological debate. There is even at least one anthology 84</page><page sequence="22">A Provisional Response tion that special revelation in fact presupposes special divine activities and therefore fails the test of credibility. It depends on what "special" is taken to mean.56 Recall Wyman's interpretation of Schleiermacher's thoughts on revelation in the Speeches on Religion. Is it strictly true that the action of the universe on us is "uniform"? Even if we grant that na- ture's ceaseless activity reflects the uniform application of so-called laws, the products of the activity are diverse and so, accordingly, are their ef- fects on ourselves. When these products become the occasions of revela- tion, they are by no means taken as equally significant. Some of them are "special," but not in the sense that nature works harder at them or that by them the ordinary processes of nature are supplemented or suspended. Rather, they have special importance in forming our general perception of the kind of universe we live in-and hence of its ultimate cause, ground, or first principle. The analogy commonly invoked here proposes that we should not think of God's activity as resembling the interaction between one self and another, but as more like the relationship between a single self and its own psychic or bodily activities. Still anthropomorphic, no doubt! But more properly so, insofar as the comparison avoids misrepresenting God's activity as akin to the discrete actions of a finite agent in space and time. Christian theologians will presumably wish to insist that God is the en- during ground of all temporal events, including the acts of free agents. The analogy enables them, however, to make good sense of the concept of special or historical revelation. For although everything I do is my activity, it is obvious that some of the things I do are better indications than others of my essential and characteristic self and in this sense may be said to be, or to become, "special revelations" of who I am. I would be unwilling to surrender the credibility of a special, historical revelation of God before the possibility of rethinking the concept along these lines had been given (to borrow one of Wyman's expressions) "a fair chance." Schleiermacher, it is true, though he proposes the analogy,57 seems to jeopardize it by his insistence that while the divine causality is coextensive with natural causality (dem Umfange nach ihr gleichgesetzt), it is nonetheless, devoted to the concept: Owen C. Thomas, ed., God's Activity in the World: The Contemporary Problem, American Academy of Religion Studies in Religion, no. 31 (Chico, Calif.: Schol- ars, 1983). 56 Clearly, the problem is not unrelated to the problem of Schleiermacher's describing the appearance of the Redeemer as, in a sense, supernatural. Both problems are set by the denial that the divine activity can ever be construed as intervention in the regular course of events. The difference, however is that now the question is not about one wholly nonanal- ogous event (Schleiermacher) but several special events that are admitted to be analogous to one another (Troeltsch). 57 Schleiermacher, Gl., sec. 52.2. 85</page><page sequence="23">The Journal of Religion as timeless and spaceless, utterly opposed to it.58 Do we then have to say of God's activity, if not of nature's activity, that it is "uniform"? H. R. Mackintosh complained that "the causality of God is presented [by Schleiermacher] as operating in the world as an infinite, uniform and quite undeviating pressure, like that of a hydraulic apparatus, with its allotted equal weight on each square inch."59 How could the diverse prod- ucts of nature tell us anything special about a divine causality so con- ceived? How, indeed, could such an absolute causality operate on the world at all? The process theologians will assure us that there are better metaphysical foundations on which to rest the self-body analogy, and the "fair chance" I am asking for will need to take into account the neoclassi- cal alternative, with which Wyman has strong sympathies. If the analogy holds good, special revelation is not inconsistent with the view that God's activity (Tdtigkeit) grounds every historical event and cannot properly be construed as a particular act (Tat), or sequence of acts, within history. To this extent, special revelation is not excluded by the criterion of credi- bility. My second comment has to do with Wyman's other theological crite- rion. His proposal is that we think of creation as the "original revelation" and that we need not attribute anything more to supposed historical reve- lations than imaginative interpretation of it. He then suggests that to take creation itself as the original revelation of God meets the criterion of theological appropriateness because "Christian faith is, among other things, also faith in creation." But the suggestion sounds a little disingen- uous if the other things are in effect reduced to this one thing. Naturally, the move that I see beginning, at least, in Calvin demands a rethinking of the classical way of relating natural and revealed knowledge of God. If revelation is the self-communication of God received in the confidence and obedience of faith, then it cannot be quantified in the old manner, as though the revelation in Scripture were simply more information added to information already imparted. The God encountered in the bib- lical witness to Jesus Christ is the God revealed in the created order.

Schleiermacher's sharp differentiation of divine from natural causality did not inhibit his derivation of divine attributes from experience, though it qualified their status. They denote something particular or special not in God but in the way the feeling of absolute dependence is to be connected with God (Schleiermacher, Gl., sec. 50). As such, they are modes of the divine causality (sec. 82, postscript). And yet they certainly assert something true about God, and one of them, love, is to be taken as the equivalent of God's being or nature (sec. 167.1). Schleiermacher's notion of absolute causality, whether or not it should, did not in fact prevent him from thinking of individual divine attributes without divine intervention.</page><page sequence="24">A Provisional Response ertheless, the distinction between "the knowledge of God the Creator" and "the knowledge of God the Redeemer in Christ" remains fundamen- tal to systematic theology, even if it is neither a distinction between two Gods nor a matter of an increasing quantity of information about the one true God. Let me turn to John Calvin once more. He is surely correct when he asserts: "It is one thing to perceive (sentire) that God our Maker sustains us by his power, governs us by his providence, cherishes us with his good- ness, and attends us with blessings of every kind: quite another thing to embrace the grace of reconciliation offered to us in Christ."60 For Calvin, the dividing line that made the knowledge of God twofold was the disobe- dience of Eve and Adam at the beginning of time. But we do not need to follow him in the doctrine of a historical fall. The essential point is that, in everyman's and everywoman's experience, revelation is given under the conditions of estrangement, God-forgetfulness, doubt, ennui, moral insensitivity, guilt, despair-all that is covered by the old-fashioned rubric "sin." Whether or not the context of estrangement and reconciliation re- quires us to think in terms of some added content to what is given in the "original" revelation of God will no doubt depend in part on our understanding of the redemption accomplished by Jesus of Nazareth, and I cannot enter adequately into that question here.6' I am more con- cerned to insist that the heart of the Christian theological enterprise is the theme of revelation and faith under the conditions that threaten faith and the conditions of its renewal. I do not, of course, wish to imply that Wyman intends to disregard these conditions, only that the test of appro- priateness to the Christian witness must keep them at the center. The security of a concept of revelation cannot be established without giving due weight to both criteria: appropriateness as well as credibility. But I suspect that, in practice, the quest for security tends to push us toward the epistemological problem of credibility, exposing us to Albrecht 87 60 Calvin, Institutio (n. 1 above), 1.2.1. 61 The ways of getting at the "more," if any, of Christian revelation are very diverse. For Calvin, redemption is restoration to prelapsarian piety, but with the significant difference that the goodness of God is now disclosed as the grace of forgiveness. For Schleiermacher, it is only in our experience of Christ that we know the love of God and perceive the world as a theater of redemption. For Rudolf Bultmann, while there is a "more" of the gospel, it does not lie in the content of revelation but, rather, in its occurrence for me. And so we might go on. In my own dogmatic lectures, I have tried to allow for the "more" by speaking of "the distinctively Christian way of believing, in which elemental faith is confirmed, specified, and represented as filial trust in God 'the Father of Jesus Christ."' Every attempt to identify the "more" of Christian revelation reflects a particular understanding of redemption. My own case turns around the conviction that the heart of Christ's saving work is precisely the gift of faith. But I would not say that Christian or saving faith is only "reassurance of primal or secular faith," nothing more (see Wyman [in this issue], n. 91).</page><page sequence="25">The Journal of Religion Ritschl's famous remark about theologians who remain standing in the court of the Gentiles.62 There I must leave my response to my three conversation partners. The measure of my appreciation for the contributions of all three is not any compliments I may have dropped along the way but the fact that I have felt, and still feel, bound to engage them-notably different from one another as their positions are, and all of them different in varying degrees from my own. I do not need to be told that, at every step of the way, I have implicitly raised a host of questions that I leave unanswered or that I have passed over in silence still other theological options that many will find more plausible and instructive than any of the four ex- plored here. I have called my response "provisional" because I trust the conversation will continue. For my part, I take the theological enterprise in the good, old way as an exercise of faith in quest of understanding. It may have become a more risky enterprise than Augustine or Anselm could have imagined. The increase of understanding these days demands a willingness to entertain second thoughts about faith. But, up to a point, it always has. In any case, I cannot imagine that the leisure that retire- ment (I am told) will eventually bring me will find me doing anything more worthwhile than continuing the quest. I hope my three conversa- tion partners will still be arguing with me, doing their best to keep me honest. 88 62 Otto Ritschl, Albrecht Ritschls Leben, 2 vols. (Freiburg i. B. and Leipzig: J. C. B. Mohr, 1892-96), 2:106. My comments on "appropriateness" were formulated in response to an earlier version of Wyman's paper. I welcome the explicit attention he gives to this criterion in the last two paragraphs of the present version, although he was not able to carry the discussion any further.</page></plain_text>
