Abstract   This paper provides insight into how recent progress in robotics could affect  children’s lives in the not-so-distant future. We describe two studies in which robots  were presented to children in the context of their daily lives. The results of the first  study, which was conducted in an elementary school with a mechanical-looking  humanoid robot, showed that the robot affected children’s behaviors, feelings, and  even their friendships. The second study is a case study in which children  performed daily conversational tasks with a geminoid, a teleoperated android robot  that resembles a living individual. The results showed that children gradually  adapted to conversations with the geminoid and developed an awareness of the  personality or presence of the person controlling the geminoid. These studies  provide clues to the process of children’s adaptation to interactions with robots and  particularly how they start treating robots as intelligent beings.    Keywords: human-robot interaction, humanoid robots, androids      © 2009 Children, Youth and Environments  </page> <page sequence="2"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 13  Introduction  Our everyday lives already contain many machines with new technologies, and in  the future this number will increase. Researchers have started to investigate how  children and youths’ interactions with new technologies changes their daily lives,  such as digital media culture on the Internet (Montgomery 2000), computer-based  learning technologies (Roschelle et al. 2000), animated toys (Ackermann 2005),  and robotic toys for education (Raffle, Ishii and Yip 2007). Wartella and Jennings  (2000) discussed the importance of the contents of such new media. Druin (2002)  involved children in the design process of such new media and their contents.    Although the new technologies are becoming more interactive, these machines only  behave as tools to be used by humans and are not considered communicative  partners. Most people believe that they can only communicate with humans, or  perhaps also with their pets. In contrast, roboticists have extended the notion of  communicative partners to humanoid robots and androids. A “humanoid robot”  usually refers to a robot with an anthropomorphic appearance that behaves like a  human. A number of possible applications have been considered for such robots,  including carrying heavy objects, serving as collaborative assistants in space  exploration, and working as shopkeepers. For all these applications, humanoid  robots must communicate with people. Thus, one important challenge in the study  of humanoid robots is to investigate how people, particularly children, can interact  with such humanoid robots. An “android” usually refers to a robot with human-like  appearances and behaviors, whose aim is to be perceived as a real human (Minato  et al. 2004). An android that models a real human provides a particularly powerful  way to research questions such as the elements that are required to form a parent- child relationship.    These two new types of robots are considered promising in robotics, and many  companies and universities are currently investing significant resources into them.  For example, Honda Motors developed ASIMO, a bipedal walking robot, which  encouraged robotics researchers to study biped-walking mechanisms. Breazeal and  Scassellati (1999) developed Kismet, a face robot, with which they are exploring  the social aspects of robots. Nakadai et al. (2001) developed a humanoid head that  tracks a speaking person with visual and auditory data. Aibo, Sony’s robotic dog,  which was the first commercially successful interactive robot (Fujita 2001), behaved  in many ways as a real pet. Recently, Shibata (2004) utilized a seal-type pet robot  as a therapy tool that also showed success in the mass market. Burgard et al.  (1998) developed a museum tour guide robot with robust navigational skills that  functioned as a museum orientation tool. Although these efforts featured relatively  simple robots, sophisticated methods for producing robotic technologies are  allowing designers to create increasingly human-like robots in terms of appearance  and behavior, and with such capabilities as remembering, learning, and adapting.    These and many other research efforts are focusing on the concept of  “communication robots” in society. However, it remains unclear whether people will  really communicate with robots. Even though a single study might have difficulty  answering such a vast research question, we must start to collect evidence about  how people relate to robots in their lives. Studying children is particularly important,  </page> <page sequence="3"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 14  since they often interact naturally without being affected by such preconceived  adult notions as “a human cannot communicate with a robot.” In addition, young  people can get readily acclimated to new cultures; for example, Manga culture was  originally aimed at young people, but as they became adults, they retained their  interest and connection to Manga. We believe that observing how children relate to  robots is interesting and might provide clues for thinking about our future lives with  robots.    In this paper, we report on two studies of children with robots. The first study  involves children interacting with humanoid robots in an elementary school, and  provides insights into the implications for their futures with robots. The second  study is a case study that compares how children react to a person with a biological  body and to one with a robotic android body. This case study concentrates on the  interaction between a child and an android modeled on her father to provide insight  about the future when such androids may be common.    The Humanoid Robot Study in an Elementary School    Purpose  The first study explored the potential for using robots in elementary schools to  support particular pedagogical goals. We placed two interactive humanoid robots  that only speak English in a Japanese elementary school to imitate the arrival of an  international transfer student to encourage foreign language study.    Methods  Robovie  Figure 1 shows Robovie (Kanda et al. 2004b), a humanoid robot that is capable of  human-like expressions and recognizes individuals using various actuators and  sensors. Its body possesses highly articulated arms, with four degrees of freedom  (DOF), eyes (two DOF), and a head (three DOF) that were designed to produce  sufficient gestures for effectively communicating with humans. The sensory  equipment includes auditory, tactile, ultrasonic, and vision sensors that allow the  robot to behave autonomously and to interact with humans. All processing and  control systems, such as the computer and motor control hardware, are located  inside the robot’s body.    </page> <page sequence="4"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 15  Figure 1. Robovie          Person Identification Mechanism   Person identification is one of the robot’s unique functions. In addition to the robot’s  basic hardware, we employed a wireless tag system to identify individuals  interacting with it. A tag (Figure 2) periodically transmits its ID, which is received  by the reader on the robot. In turn, the reader provides received IDs to the robot’s  software system. The wireless tags are embedded in a 5-cm diameter nameplate  that each child wears, so they are easy to carry.     Figure 2. Tags          Interactive Behaviors  The robot’s task was to engage in daily communications, much as children do. One  hundred behaviors called situated modules (Kanda et al. 2004b) were developed:  70 interactive behaviors such as shaking hands, hugging, playing paper-rock- scissors, exercising, greeting, kissing, singing, holding short conversations, and  pointing to an object in its surroundings; 20 idling behaviors such as scratching its  </page> <page sequence="5"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 16  head and folding its arms; and 10 moving behaviors. Since this trial was designed  as an English education task, every situated module was only performed in an  English context, either as an utterance from the robot or in recognizing the  utterances of people and children. The robot can say more than 300 English  sentences and recognizes about 50 English words.    Several situated modules use person identification. For example, one situated  module calls a person’s name at a certain distance to encourage interaction with  the robot. Another one asks a person to play a body-part touching game and  remembers the children’s answers.    We prepared 800 episode rules (Kanda et al. 2004b) for making transitions among  situated modules.  For example, Robovie occasionally asks humans to interact with  it by saying, “Let’s play ‘touch me’,” and exhibits idling or moving behaviors until a  human responds. Once a human reacts, Robovie carries on friendly behaviors as  long as the human responds to them. When the human stops reacting, Robovie  stops the friendly behaviors, says “good bye,” and re-starts its idling or moving  behaviors.    Field Trial  We performed the experiment at an elementary school in two two-week sessions.  The subjects were students in three first grade and three sixth grade classes. There  were 119 first graders (6-7 years old, 59 boys and 60 girls) for the first session and  109 sixth graders (11-12 years old, 53 boys and 56 girls) for the second session.  Each session consisted of nine school days. Two identical robots were put in a  corridor connecting the three classrooms (Figure 3). Children could freely interact  with both robots during recess. Each child had a nameplate with an embedded  wireless tag for identification by the robot during the interaction.    Figure 3. Robot in a corridor        </page> <page sequence="6"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 17  Results  The main purpose of the field trial was to observe the effect of the robot for  improving the children’s listening capability. We conducted an English listening test  three times (before, one week after, and two weeks after the beginning of the  session) that revealed the improvement of the scores over time. These results are  reported in detail in Kanda et al. (2004a).    First Graders’ Overall Transition of Interaction over Time  The left side of Figure 4 shows the transition of the interaction between the robot  and the first graders. Here, the bar graph showing “number of interacted children”  represents the total number of children who approached the robot (identified by the  robot’s wireless system) each day. The overlaid “rate of vacant time” graph is the  percentage of time when no child was around the robot each day. Since the graphs  seem to indicate three major phases during the two weeks, we divided it into the  following three phases: (a) first day, (b) first week (except first day), and (c)  second week. Here, we describe the transition of the interaction among these three  phases.      Figure 4. Transition of number of children playing with robot (left graph-    first graders; right graph- sixth graders)  (Total:119) (Total:109) 120 100% 120 100% 100 100 80 80 60 50% 60 50% 40 40 20 20 0 0% 0 0% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (Day) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (Day) Num . of interacted children Num. of interacted children Rate of vacant tim e Rate of vacant time       First day: much excitement. On the first day, as many as 37 children gathered  around the robots at once (Figure 5). They pushed to get closer to the robots, tried  to touch them, and spoke to them loudly. Since the corridor and classrooms were  filled with the children’s loud voices, it was not always possible to understand what  the robots and children said. It seemed that almost all of the children wanted to  interact with the robots. Many children watching the excitement around the robots  joined the interaction by switching places with the children who were around the  robots. On the first day, 116 out of 119 first-grade students interacted with the  robots.      </page> <page sequence="7"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 18  Figure 5. First day with first graders: children crowded around robot; few    stayed in classroom         First week: stable interaction. The excitement of the first day soon ebbed. The  average number of simultaneously interacting children gradually decreased. In the  first week, the robots were used by the first-grade children most of the time, so the  rate of vacant time remained quite low. Several children came in front of a robot,  touched it, and watched its response. The interaction between the children and the  robots started to resemble conversation. Figure 6 shows one such active interaction  between a robot and two girls. The children seemed to speak when the robot was  not speaking, as if taking turns, although the robot controlled the conversation. A  girl spoke to the robot in English but she gave up when the robot failed to react to  her utterance. Another girl tried to show her nameplate by saying “perceive  (wakare).” Unfortunately, the robot did not pick up any of their words and only  reacted to their touching.    Figure 6.

Girl B: Perceive (wakare), perceive (wakare) (scene 4)  Robovie: What would you like me to play with you?  Girl B: Perceive  Robovie: What game would you like to play?  ...      Second week: saturation. In the second week, saturation occurred. At the  beginning of the week, the vacancy time around the robots suddenly increased, and  the number of children who played with them decreased. Near the end, no children  were around the robots during half of the daily experiment time. On average, 2.0  children were simultaneously interacting with a robot during the second week,  which was advantageous for the robots since it was easier for them to talk with just  a few of the children at a time. The children seemed to play with the robots in ways  similar to the first week’s style. Thus, the only apparent difference between the first  and second weeks was that the frequency of children playing with the robots  decreased.    Comparison with Sixth Graders  The right side of Figure 4 shows the results for the sixth grade classes. The robots  apparently held less fascination for the sixth graders than for the first graders.  Similar to the first grade, at the beginning of the second week vacant time  increased and the number of interacting children decreased. Therefore, the three  phases, first day, first week, and second week, also existed with the sixth graders,  just as with the first graders. In the second week, the average number of  simultaneously interacting children was 4.4, which was larger than for the first  </page> <page sequence="9"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 20  grade. Many sixth graders seemed to interact with the robot with their friends,  which will be analyzed next.    Figure 7. First day with sixth graders           Figure 8. Children trying to defend their position in front of robot            Interaction Analysis for Children-Robot Communication  Although we did not systematically study further interaction, the interaction  between the children and the robots in the field trial contains various intriguing  clues for further speculation for children-robot communication. Thus, we conducted  a more detailed informal investigation of the children’s behaviors. The episodes  below were retrieved from the experimenters’ daily observation of notable scenes  and episodes.    Robot’s person identification. Some interesting scenes suggest the importance  of the robot’s ability to identify persons.  • Figure 8 shows a scene where children were aware of the robot’s body  orientation. Children pushed to get closer to the robot and to be addressed  by it. In the left of Figure 8, Child A (circled) was positioned at the robot’s  side at the beginning, but when the robot rotated its body orientation, Child  A quickly moved to position himself in front of the robot (center of Figure 8),  and this same child pushed another child to defend his position (right of  Figure 8).  </page> <page sequence="10"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 21  • Child B did not seem to understand English at all. However, after hearing her  name said by the robot, she seemed very pleased and began to interact with  the robot more often.  • Children C and D counted how many times the robot called their respective  names. C’s name was called more often, so C bragged that he was preferred  by the robot.    Sympathy for the robot. The occurrence of transition phases during the child- robot interactions suggest that the communicative relationships between the  children and the robots generally did not last for more than one week. However,  some children developed sympathy for the robot.   • Child G said, “I feel sorry for the robot because no other children are playing  with it.”   • Child H played with the robot for the same reason.    We consider this an early form of a long-term relationship; this is potentially  similar to the sympathy that some children may develop for a new transfer student  who has no friends. In reality, our later study in an elementary school shows that  one-third of the children in the classroom continued to interact with the robot for  two months (Kanda et al. 2007).    Robot as a social mediator. Children often approached the robot with their  friends. Table 1 indicates the rate at which the children interacted with the robot  with their friends. (Children provided the names of their friends by questionnaires  before the experiment, and they were compared with the ID information obtained  through the wireless tag system.) In the first grade, 48 percent of the time the  children played with the robot with their friends; 78 percent of the sixth graders’  interactions with the robot was with their friends.      Table 1.

In the second scene (center), two boys started to  interact with the robot. At that particular moment, the robot started “kiss  me” behavior, a pretend kissing game. The boys pushed each other so that  one of the boys was kissed by the robot. The boys’ responses to the robot  influenced the girls, who smiled and laughed; the boys noticed the girls’  behavior, which might have made their reactions toward the robot more  active.  • Child E passed by the robot without intending to play with it; but after he  saw Child F playing with the robot, he joined the interaction.      Figure 9. Two groups of children with the robot playing “kiss me”            Discussion  The humanoid robot was new to the children. In the beginning they were curious  about it, but they did not know how to interact with it; they tried to look at it, to  touch it, and to speak to it; they crowded around it. This situation was observed in  both the first and sixth graders. This crowd soon dissipated, and instead we  observed interaction that resembled a child with an animal; sometimes the children  imitated the robot, and sometimes they observed how the robot reacted; they  seemed to enjoy such an exchange of actions. The interaction does not resemble  using a tool as much as peer and partner relationships (see the discussion about a  robot as a tool versus peer and partner in Breazeal 2004; Fong, Thorpe and Baur  2002). This scene illustrates a case where the children treated the robot’s existence  as autonomous, life-like, and interactive, although this might be very far from a  human adult’s “communication.” Children enjoyed interacting with the robot, and  some even expressed sympathy for it. We believe that this is one of the first studies  that provides evidence of children rapidly adapting to an interactive humanoid robot  and developing relationships with it.    This study invites speculation about the future with robots such as these and  children. In this study, the robot was not communicative in terms of verbal  interaction. It often failed to detect what the children said, so it did not react to  what they said. Instead, it usually interacted with tactile input from children and  called their names by identifying their RFID tags. However, technologies are  advancing very quickly. Researchers are developing techniques for robust speech  recognition in noisy environments, which was difficult a few years ago. We believe  that soon it will be possible to create a robot that talks to children in an elementary  school; moreover, it will be technically possible to develop such a robot as a  </page> <page sequence="12"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 23  security guard, a cleaning person, a delivery person, and even a teacher. We  believe that children will highly engage with such a robot and be greatly affected by  its behavior. Before this type of a robot is developed, we should conduct the  necessary research with children.    The Case Study with an Android  In our second study, which investigated a different aspect of child-robot interaction,  children’s attitudes toward a teleoperated android robot were examined. This robot,  Geminoid HI-1 (Nishio et al. 2007a), is equipped with an appearance quite similar  to an existing person, O, (Figure 10) who remotely controlled its speech and motion.  HI-1 was used as a communication medium for conversation between the person  and the children. HI-1 shows automatically generated subtle movements such as  breathing and eye blinks, like the human autonomous system. These slight  movements are known to moderate the uncanny impression of android robots and  make them seem more like living beings (Minato et al. 2004). Roughly speaking,  the remote person performs HI-1’s higher brain functions such as consciousness or  intelligence, and the robotic system substitutes HI-1’s autonomous system that  maintains its body. This design was chosen because current artificial intelligence  technology is still too immature to perform humanlike conversation. With this  composition, we can investigate the effect of changing the body while the mind  remains the same. That is, we can investigate what happens when robotic  intelligence becomes similar to human and reaches the “singularity point” (Zorpette  2008) in the future, or investigate what physical elements are required for robots to  be treated as intelligent beings similar to humans.     Figure 10.  Geminoid HI-1 (left) and its source (right)        We conducted a case study using the Geminoid HI-1 robot with two child  participants with extreme levels of familiarity with the target (Nishio et al. 2007b).  Participant R was O’s 10-year-old daughter who was obviously very familiar with O.  </page> <page sequence="13"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 24  The other participant, K, was a 4-year-old boy who had never met O, nor had he  ever seen or heard about HI-1 before the experiment. The two participants were  not told who the source of the geminoid was or who was controlling it. In the past,  R had been the source of a child android (Minato et al. 2004) and had joined some  humanoid robot experiments. K is the son of one of the authors and had seen and  played with humanoid robots several times at exhibitions, but had never seen a  humanlike android of any kind before this experiment. As exhibitions or shows with  robots are frequently held in Japan these days, such as in department stores, K’s  experience with robots is not extraordinary compared with other children of the  same age.    In contrast to the first study, our interest here was to see what kind of differences  would appear in children’s attitudes toward different bodies (biological and  mechanical) and how their attitude toward the robot would change as conversation  with it proceeded. The following outlines the procedure and results of the case  study. Details are described in Nishio et al. 2007b.    Methods  Participants engaged in two conditions: conversations with the geminoid (G) version  of O, and with the real person O (P). In the real person condition, O limited his  movements so that they would resemble those of HI-1. Each child participated in  each condition twice, with an interval of one week. Thus, we held four sessions for  each participant. In each session, we chose several conversational tasks for the  children, based on their parents’ opinions and pretest observations. The tasks were  different for each participant, reflecting the children’s interests and ages, so they  could participate without becoming bored during the sessions. For R, some chosen  tasks required conversation about family memories. Each session continued  approximately 30 minutes. To help them relax, we included a habituation period at  the beginning of each day before the sessions. On the first day, the children spent  some time in the experiment room reading or playing with their mothers. During  this first habituation period, the android was hidden. On the second day, the  participants and their mothers spent some time together talking and playing with  HI-1. Also, after each child’s individual session with the geminoid, we held an  interview in which mothers asked their children about their impressions following  the interview instruction.     Results  From the video recordings of each session, we measured three indices: eye contact  rate, amount of conversation, and amount of participants’ body movement. No  significant difference was found for the eye contact rate between the G and P  conditions. Regarding the amount of conversation, the levels in the G conditions  were lower than the P conditions. For R, the differences between each condition  were rather weak (Figure 11). As for K, the overall level was clearly lower in the G  conditions. This was especially clear in the very beginning of the first G session  when K met the HI-1 for the very first time. K remained quiet throughout the task.  In contrast, K had a high level of conversation at the beginning of the first P session.  However, in the second sessions, the differences between the conditions almost  </page> <page sequence="14"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 25  vanished (Figure 12). As for the eye contact rate, R showed a slightly lower value in  the G condition, but we found no clear difference for K.      Figure 11. Participant R in conversation with Geminoid HI-1, second    session (session G-2)           Figure 12. Participant K in conversation with Geminoid HI-1, first and   second sessions (sessions G-1 and G-2)          The participant K’s levels showed a clearer difference between talking with HI-1 and  talking with O (Figure 13). Obviously, the values in the first G session are much  smaller than the other sessions. This tendency matches the impressions from the  recorded video images. In the first G session, K stayed still throughout the task. In  contrast, in the P session K always kept moving around, spoke a lot, and showed  rich facial expressions, just as in his daily life. In the second geminoid session, the  values got closer to the levels in the P sessions. In contrast, R’s motion amounts  were rather low in both cases.   </page> <page sequence="15"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 26  Figure 13.  Body movement changes. Participant K’s temporal changes    during first task in each session. Horizontal orange line    indicates average level.          From the interview recording, we found that even though both participants were  scared of the geminoid, they eventually had quite different impressions. R realized  that HI-1 was a robot being remotely controlled by her father, and most of her  reactions were based on this finding. She described HI-1 as scary and did not think  it looked like her own farther, but she could not specify exactly why. She preferred  her real father because HI-1 “can’t play Wee (portable game player) with me,  because it can’t grasp things.”    K had a different impression. After the first P session, K insisted that the person O  was a robot. He thought that it was alive and breathing, and its figure was normal,  but he insisted that it was a robot. He described the “robot” as very “serious” and  said that the entity listened well to his story and that he would like to play with it.  After the first session with the HI-1, however, K said, “I thought the first one was a  robot, but that was a mistake. This one must be a robot.” K believed that HI-1 was  wearing a mask and said “it was very scary, because it had a very thin nose.”  (Actually, the size of HI-1 and O’s noses were almost identical.) He also mentioned  that it was not breathing and that its mouth was not moving well when it was  speaking. K seemed confused by his experience. He sometimes described HI-1 as a  robot, but later he said it was “a person wearing a strange mask.” “He should take  off that strange mask that he kept wearing,” K said.    Discussion  Although the participants described HI-1 as scary, the measurements showed that  their attitudes toward HI-1 were gradually approximated to their attitudes toward  the real person. This was especially clear from K’s video recording, where he  </page> <page sequence="16"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 27  remained silent and still in the first half of the first G condition and then gradually  became active, recovering his usual behavior (Figure 12). However, differences  remained, especially in the measurements from participant K. One factor might be  facial expressiveness. As seen in K’s comment where he thought HI-1 was wearing  a mask, the geminoid’s facial expressiveness is not sufficient. However, even with  the current immature robotic body, the children showed a tendency to gradually  adapt to the geminoid, even within the short-term interaction of merely two days.  This suggests that if the children were in touch with geminoids from their early  stage of development, their uncanny feelings might diminish, just as children’s  perceptual functions become tuned to frequent stimuli (Kuhl, Tsao and Liu 2003;  Pascalis, Haan, and Nelson 2002). Cartoons are one typical example of this  tendency. Although the facial or body features of cartoon characters are  exaggerated and greatly different from real humans, the uncanny feeling vanishes  as one concentrates on the story. After a time, one never feels weirdness seeing  talking mice and ducks walking around at Disney. But when one of the authors of  this paper took his 1-year-old son there, the son started crying. He had never seen  such strange creatures.     For the daughter, R, HI-1’s voice and speech content suggested that her father was  operating it. This belief might have overcome her fearful impression of HI-1.  Although she preferred her real father, her behavior measurements showed only  slight differences between her real and fake father. The only reason she gave for  her preference was that HI-1 couldn’t play with her.    General Discussion and Conclusion  This paper reported on two studies. The first study generally affirmed the positive  potential for the use of interactive humanoid robots in an elementary school setting.  Observations suggested that over time the children transitioned from a novelty  phase in which they displayed excitement during their interactions with the robots  to a phase in which they showed more subdued behavior, potentially reflecting a  lack of interest or boredom in their interactions with the robots. At the same time,  some observations suggested the large potential of robots to affect children’s  behaviors, feelings, and even their friendships.    In the second study, we compared the adaptation processes of children in a long  conversation with a teleoperated humanlike robot and with a real person. The  children gradually overcame the robot’s rather uncanny outlook and began to show  attitudes toward it similar to those they exhibited toward a real human being. From  this case study, numerous questions arise: was it the appearance of the robot or its  intelligence, or both, that helped children adapt to the robot? Was the robot  showing the “presence” of the person it was modeled after? If so, what was the key  element for showing it? Intelligent response is certainly one way to encourage  children to continue to interact with robots. Our interest here is how much human- like function or outlook is required to keep the children’s attention, and how does  this requirement change as they grow up. Our results suggest that the importance  of appearance and intelligence differ between the two ages (4 and 10 years old),  but further examination is still required, including any cross-effects between  appearance and intelligence.   </page> <page sequence="17"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 28  This question of whether humans can communicate with robots is not easily  answered, since it involves a philosophical discussion about the definition of  communication. Still, our speculation about this question is leaning toward a “yes,”  at least in terms of children. Roughly speaking, these two studies examine the  presence of robots within two aspects of children’s daily lives: interaction with peers  (i.e., a child-like robot) and interaction with adults. Regarding the former, we  observed a number of children in the elementary school treating the robot as  autonomous, life-like, and being interactive. Regarding adults, the phenomena were  mixed: one child associated lifelikeness to the android, and both communicated  with it, but this is partly due to the robot being controlled by a real person. We did  not find any evidence where a particular child behaved as if he/she could not  communicate with the robots in either study, which is contrary to some adults who  explicitly say, “I cannot communicate with robots,” and refuse to talk with them.     In the past, new technologies changed children’s lives, such as TV, computers and  computer games, and the Internet (see Montgomery 2000; Roschelle et al. 2000;  Wartella and Jennings 2000). How will robotic technologies change children’s  futures? We conclude with further speculations, and offer some new research  questions related to interactive humanoid robots and androids in children's lives    Essentials for Healthy Parent-Child Relationship  How will robots affect children’s lives at home and relationships with their parents?  When interactive toys such as Furby were marketed, and robots such as Paro  (Shibata, Tashima and Tanie 1999) and Kismet (Breazeal 2002) appeared, children’s  inquiries shifted from “Does it swim?” and “Does it eat?” to “Is it alive?” and “Can it  love?” (Turkle 2006). The children perceived the toys or the robots as something  weak that required nursing. Our first study described in this paper, and a recent  study on a small humanoid robot in a kindergarten (Tanaka, Cicourel and Movellan  2007), also suggested the same tendency, where some children showed empathy  toward robots and took care of them. However, with robots like Geminoid HI-1,  these inquiries may further shift to “Can I rely on it?” and “Will it love me?”. These  types of questions suggest that children may perceive robots as someone who may  look after them, as most adults do in their world view. Classical studies found that  certain elements are essential for forming attachment and healthy development  (Harlow and Zimmerman 1959). With current technologies, it is possible to build  robots with warm and soft bodies. If we could build warm and soft embodied robots  with a physical functionality to play with children, and with the impression that they  can be trusted, could parents be replaced by robots? As Kahn et al. (2007) discuss,  the biological “platform” of human beings or animals may not be an essential  element in comparative studies. Our second study presented here shows the  possibility that the biological bodies of parents may be replaced by robotic figures.  And further, although the “singularity point” may still be science fiction, even the  mind may be partially replaced by some simple artificial programs when certain  memories are shared with children. Are physical functionality and impressions the  only elements necessary for a sufficient relationship to be formed between children  and their parents or caregivers for healthy child development? What are the true  essentials required?    </page> <page sequence="18"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 29  This idea also reveals some concerns over ethical issues. Kahn et al. (2004) studied  how children perceive Aibo, a dog-like pet robot, and raised the risk of moral  attribution of children to such robotic animals. Such a concern might be more  serious if robots seem to be intelligent and human-like, as in the two studies shown  in this paper. Would leaving a child with a humanoid robot or a geminoid be  acceptable, or would it be abuse? How will child-raising change if children spend  more time with an android than their parents?    Education in Schools  How might robots be used in education? Computers are already being used as tools  for such purposes. People have also started to use robotic tools for education  (Raffle, Ishii and Yip 2007). In contrast, our paper discusses a robot as a peer,  which could be controversial in education: can a robot function as a teacher,  possessing the authority, the trust, and the right to discipline children? Could a  robot ultimately teach better than humans? Even if so, would it be socially  accepted? What are the concerns about such teacher robots? Would they negatively  affect children’s perception of humans?    Play among Children  Will robots change how children play with each other? Over time, technologies have  affected children’s play (e.g., Montgomery 2000). Children have started to shift  their playground from outside to inside, playing computer games and watching TV  and Manga (Takeuchi 1994). In contrast, our field trial indicates the potential for a  robot to mediate children who are playing together. Would the use of such a robot  be encouraged? How would healthy use be defined? A robot who is acting as a peer  playmate of children could affect their relationships (e.g., by more or less  frequently helping certain children play together). Would it be socially accepted if  rich children had robots to gain acceptance from other children? Will possessing  robots become the new digital divide?    Daily Lives: Perception of Virtual and Real Worlds  Over time, new media have changed people’s way of communication. For example,  Turkle (1995) observed identity problems on the Internet. Children recognize many  characters from virtual worlds, such as Mickey Mouse and Pokemon. Using these  characters or famous persons on TV, robots could connect the virtual world to the  real world. For example, new media have changed children’s shopping roles, such  as converting children into customers through the Internet (Montgomery 2000). By  communicating with children, a robot could also be used to encourage shopping  (e.g., a Mickey Mouse robot selling a toy Mickey Mouse robot). Would such use of  characters confuse children about the boundary between the virtual and real  worlds?    Admittedly, our observations about new robot technology in children’s lives are  premature. It will take more than ten years before such new technologies are ready  to be used; however, this situation is no longer science fiction. Will psychologists  wait to observe children after new technologies have changed the world? Will  roboticists develop technologies without considering their consequences, especially  on children? For such complicated technologies as social robots, their potential  </page> <page sequence="19"> Interactive Humanoid Robots and Androids in Children’s Lives 30  effect on the social and psychological aspects of children seems large. We hope this  paper helps to connect psychologists and roboticists, so that they can work  together before the creation of new technologies affects children.
