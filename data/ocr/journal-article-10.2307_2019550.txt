Some of these statements seem to be the product of a "tough-minded" thinker; others, to be the work of one who is essentially "tender-minded." Such discrepancies create a prob- lem for the student who is seeking in Peirce a coherent system of thought. Nor is the problem made easier by reading Peirce's own account of his method of philosophical composition. I have never, in any philosophical writing . . . made any statement which was not based on at least half a dozen attempts, in writing, to subject the whole question to a very far more minute and critical examination than could be attempted in print, these attempts being made quite independently of one another, at intervals of many months, but subsequently compared to- gether with the most careful criticism. My waverings, therefore, have never been due to haste [5.146].2 In the light of such a statement, which I think must be taken seriously, it becomes an important task to try to discover the cause of Peirce's "waverings." The hypothesis I wish to suggest is that this cause is to be found in a pair of opposed philosophical tendencies which were simultaneously present in his mind. When formulated in some detail, these tendencies can be seen as two con- flicting sets of assumptions which functioned in such a way as to prevent him from elaborating a complete philosophical "system." My aim in the present paper is to assemble some evidence in support of this hypothesis. I shall first offer a brief characterization of the two tendencies, and then illustrate their effects in several areas of Peirce's thought. I I have chosen the general terms "naturalism" and "transcen- dentalism" to designate the tendencies in question. 1 Read with certain omissions at the meeting of the Charles S.

By transcendentalism I mean a philosophy which, amongst other things, assumes: (1) that feeling, instinct, sentiment, etc., yield far more significant data for philosophy than does scientific method; (2) that theory and practice have no essential connection with one another; (3) that since man's "inner world" provides him with the most important clues for the philosophical interpreta- tion of nature, it is appropriate to use in this interpretation ideas with a highly personal, or even anthropomorphic, connotation; (4) that experience is a cognitive or mental affair; (5) that speculative metaphysics can provide knowledge of the ultimate character of the cosmos. Whether or not one agrees with my labels, I think it will be admitted that we have here two sets of assumptions which must have opposite effects in determining a philosopher's conclusions. Both sets were, I believe, present in Peirce's case, though by no means of equal importance in influencing his thought. I shall now at- tempt to show how they appear in (a) his discussion of belief and knowledge, (b) his account of experience, and (c) his views on metaphysics. II (a) It is a cardinal doctrine in Peirce that man's reflective life falls exclusively within the limits of his beliefs and his doubts (5.416). Belief is the primary condition of his existence; and he is only jolted out of it by some surprising phenomenon occurring in his immediate environment (5.512). Surprise produces doubt, and the irritation of doubt causes a struggle to reach a new state of belief (5.375). This struggle takes the form of reflective in- quiry whose aim is to establish convictions that will be stable, i.e., proof against future surprise and disappointment (2.173). More- over, since beliefs "guide our desires and shape our actions" (5.371), since, indeed, beliefs are habits of action of which we are</page><page sequence="3">NATURALISM AND TRANSCENDENTALISM 367 conscious (4.53), theory and practice can never be separated from one another. ". . . every proposition that is not pure meta- physical jargon and chatter must have some possible bearing upon practice" (5.539). Genuine doubt, therefore, involves a tempor- ary paralysis of action from which we seek to be released by the setting up of a new belief. In his well-known essay of 1877, Peirce argues that the only reliable way of "fixing" belief is the method of science-that powerful combination of abduction, deduction, and induction, to the elucidation of which he devoted so much of his best thought. Science proceeds on the postulate that our beliefs are determined by a world of real things whose characteristics, though wholly in- depenldent of our opinions about them, can nevertheless be compre- hended by the investigating intelligence. Scientific method is a self-corrective process, which by repeated application can eliminate its own errors. It yields reliable but not infallible knowledge, based on evidence which is public and open to all. Only those beliefs are dependable, then, which have been purged of doubt by the method of science. Such beliefs alone are true, for "the ideas of truth and falsehood, in their full development, appertain exclusively to the experiential (scientific) method of settling opinion" (5.406). Since belief and behavior are con- tinuous, science must have a vital bearing oni practical concerns. Like all reflective inquiry, science takes for granted those be- liefs which have never been called into doubt. These "indubitable beliefs" are its vague, ultimate premises (5.515). Such beliefs may be called "inistinctive" inasmuch as they are the result of biological and social adjustments made long ago by our primitive ancestors (5.511). They are the product of evolution, and have their basis in the "total everyday experience of many generations of multitudinous populations" (5.522). However, while broadly invariant from age to age, they are by no means beyond criticism. Indeed, it is essential that these first premises should be constantly subjected to scrutiny (5.517), for "the whole history of thought shows that our instinctive beliefs, in their original condition, are so mixed up with error that they can never be trusted till they have been corrected by experiment" (1.404). The doctrines so far sketched fall quite obviously, I think, into the naturalistic pattern. I must now draw attention to a set of statements on the same theme-most of them dated after 1890- which reveal quite a different attitude. In them Peirce declares that "science has nothing directly to say concerning practical mat- ters" (1.637), for "true science is distinctively the study of useless things" (1.76). The moment a man begins to investigate a ques-</page><page sequence="4">368 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tion for some ulterior purpose, such as, "to amend his life, or to benefit his fellows," he ceases to be a scientist (1.45). Science has "nothing at stake on any temporal venture but is in pursuit of eternal verities" (5.589). It has absolutely no connection with action (1.635). For this reason "what is properly and usually called belief . . . has no place in science at all" (ibid.). We be- lieve those propositions we are ready to act on. But the scientific man will never risk anything on his conclusions; they are too tentative and fallible (ibid.). Qua scientist, all he is dealing with are certain provisional opinions which he is trying hard to prove worthless (6.3). There is, then, "no proposition at all in science which answers to the conception of belief" (1.635). In practical affairs and "matters of vital importance" not only is science worthless, but reason likewise is no proper guide. When a man attempts "to reason out his plans from first principles . . . in at least nine such cases out of ten, he blunders seriously, even if he manages to escape complete disaster" (2.176). The wise procedure is to rely entirely on instinct in the practical conduct of life, for "instinct is all but unerring; but reason in all vitally important matters is a treacherous guide" (6.86). Instincts ap- pear in consciousness as sentiments or instinctive beliefs. Indeed, it is "the sentiments that make the substance of the soul" (1.628). As soon as we try to formulate our sentiments in conceptual terms, we find that they are extremely vague. "Nevertheless, our instinc- tive beliefs involving such concepts are far more trustworthy than the best established results of science" (6.496). Even the science of logic supports this conclusion, since it "demonstrates in the clear- est manner that reasoning itself testifies to its own ultimate sub- ordination to sentiment" (1.672). The prescription of reason is that we should follow the dictates of instinct when such conduct answers our purpose (2.177). In short, where the greatest affairs of life are at stake, "the wise man follows his heart and does not trust his head" (1.653). We see here one of the familiar features of American transcen- dentalism in the nineteenth century-the romantic exalting of feel- ing and sentiment at the expense of thought. It is but a short step from such a doctrine to the view that thought has no im- portant bearing on action, and Peirce occasionally takes the step. Reason, he urges, is supreme only in matters of theory; sentiment is supreme in practical affairs (1.634). The two realms are irrecon- cilably opposed. "The two masters theory and practice you can- not serve" (1.642). When he is thinking thus, Peirce offers us such things as the curious "neglected argument" for the reality of God, and the conclusion that ethics is a pointless or even a</page><page sequence="5">NATURALISM AND TRANSCENDENTALISM 369 dangerous discipline. The contrast with his naturalism is very apparent in all this. No longer is it the case that beliefs must be fixed by the method of science before they can be accepted as re- liable. On the contrary, there seems to be almost an approval of the "method of tenacity," whose weaknesses Peirce so clearly points out elsewhere. No longer can it be said that "logicality in regard to practical matters . . . is the most useful quality an ani- mal can possess" (5.366), for logic must always bow the knee to sentiment in such matters. Thus do the two antithetical tenden- cies create a cleavage in Peirce's views on how we should appraise our fundamental beliefs. III (b) The same conflict can be illustrated, it seems to me, in Peirce's treatment of experience. This is a complex subject, and I shall concentrate only on the aspects of it that bear directly on my main theme. I shall seek to show merely that his remarks on the precise character of experience fall into two broad groups, corresponding to the pair of tendencies already noted. (1) Within the naturalistic context, Peirce speaks of experi-- ence as "the enforced element in the history of our lives" (5.581)- It is that which we are compelled to accept because it involves "a. brute bearing down of any will to resist it" (4.172). Hence, ex- perience manifests a concrete duality (5.539), a sense of something reacting against us, the shock of an alien non-ego making its im- pact on the ego (2.139; 5.52). The clearest illustration of this duality is the phenomenon of surprise. Consequently, "experi- ence" is the name we apply to contrasts or sudden changes in our perception. "We experience vicissitudes, especially" (1.336). As thus delineated, experience is "destitute of anything ra- tional" (4.172). It is simply the direct action on us of the ex- ternal world, the world of fact (1.321). Psychologically, this direct action gives us percepts, which may therefore be said to "consti- tute experience proper, that which I am forced to accept" (2.142). Since the percept "appears under a physical guise" and contains nothing psychical, it "is correct to say that we immediately, that is directly perceive matter" (1.253; 1.419). By "matter," of course, Peirce does not mean any kind of substance or substratum, but that subject whose existence is constituted by really having qualities (1.527). A preferable designation is "fact." Experi- ence may then be said to acquaint us with facts-those determinate, irrational particulars whose occurrence hic et nunc is a matter of brute force (1.435).</page><page sequence="6">370 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Such experience is wholly non-cognitive. "It affirms nothing -it just is.... It involves no error, because it testifies to nothing but its own appearance" (1.145). Nevertheless, precisely this non- cognitive experience is the source of all our knowledge. "All that we can anyway know relates to experience. All the creations of our mind are but patchworks from experience" (6.492). At the most elementary level, knowledge is obtained by describing the percept in a perceptual judgment. These two things, however, differ toto coelo. " The percept . . . is not itself a judgment, nor can a judgment in any degree resemble a percept" (5.54). "The percept is the reality. It is not in propositional form. But the most immediate judgment concerning it is abstract. It is therefore essentially unlike the reality, although it must be ac- cepted as true to that reality" (5.568). The only justification for such a judgment is that it subsequently turns out to be useful, i.e., it enables us to guide our future action (1.538). Experience, therefore, gives us "the evidence of the senses," but knowledge has to start with "a sort of stenographic report of that evidence, possibly erroneous" (2.141). Not only is experience the source of our knowledge, but it pro- vides us with the only reliable test of knowledge. For both the experimental activity and the observations whereby the conse- quences of a concept are determined are nothing more than "the deliberate yielding of ourselves to the force majeure of experi- ence " (5.581). (2) The other account which I find in Peirce produces a differ- ent sort of picture. Here, experience is equated with knowledge or cognition. "Experience means nothing but just that of a cognitive nature [italics mine] which the history of our lives has forced upon us" (5.539). It is "that determination of belief and cognition" (2.138), the "information" (1.537) or "resultant ideas" (4.318), which we have been compelled to accept. The compulsion involved here must then be a rational not an irrational affair. When he is thinking in this context, Peirce talks about perceptual facts, rather than percepts, as that which is forced upon us. For the percept is a particular event happening hic et nunc. Its locus is the immediate present. But since the immediate pres- ent is an infinitesimal interval of time (6.110), its content must be wholly ineffable (1.310). Before any experience can occur, memory must function so as to give us a perceptual fact. For "a perceptual fact is a memory hardly yet separated from the very percept"; yet it is unlike the percept in being slightly generalized, i.e., it is a cognition. Moreover, the process of forming perceptual facts is one over which we have no control (5.115). They must be ac-</page><page sequence="7">NATURALISM AND TRANSCENDENTALISM 371 cepted for what they are-the first premises of our knowledge. Perceptual facts, then, due to the operation of memory, constitute experience proper. The upshot of this approach is that experience is the result of the activity of mind. "By experience must be understood the entire mental product" (6.492). This Kantian conclusion I take to be an important part of Peirce's "transcendentalism." In at least two places he even goes so far as to affirm that our percepts, too, are "mental constructions" (2.141) or "the results of cognitive elaboration" (5.416). However, he may be thinking here of per- ceptual facts, rather than percepts proper. Be that as it may, the view that experience is a cognitive construct can only lead to a rationalistic idealism similar to that of Hegel or Bosanquet. This was, indeed, one of the directions in which Peirce 's transcendental tendency drew him. The contrast between these two versions of experience can be conveniently sharpened by relating them to his phaneroscopy. This science, it will be recalled, observes whatever appears, and discriminates its most general, "indecomposable" features. The latter turn out to be the three categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. Now it seems to me that Peirce's naturalism con- nects "experience" exclusively with one of the categories, viz., Secondness. A clear statement of the matter occurs in a letter which he wrote to William James in 1903. "The practical ex- igencies of life render 'secondness' the most prominent feature of it. This is not a conception, nor is it a quality. It is an ex- perience. It comes out most fully in the shock of reaction between ego and non-ego. . . . All the actual character of consciousness is merely the sense of the shock of the non-ego upon us.'23 There is not the slightest suggestion of a cognitive element here. Nor is there any suggestion that the non-ego is dependent on or akin to the ego. Experience is simply actuality, the compulsiveness of the world of fact or individual existence. On the other hand, Peirce sometimes takes "experience" in a much wider sense as the cognitive whole within which all three categories are contained. " I analyse experience, which is the cognitive resultant of our past lives, and find in it three elements. I call them Categories" (2.84). On this approach, while the sense of compulsion (Secondness) "accompanies every experience what- ever" (2.22), it does not constitute experience, for the latter also involves quality (Firstness) and law (Thirdness). When he is 3 Quoted in R. B. Perrv, The Thought and Character of William James, Vol. I1, p. 429.</page><page sequence="8">372 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY writing in this veiii, Peirce sometimes expresses agreement with the conclusions of Kant. Thus, in 1890 he declared: How is the extraordinary prominence of these conceptions [the categories] to be explained? Must it not be that they have their origin in the nature of the mind I This is the Kantian form of inference, which has been found so cogent in the hands of that hero of philosophy; and I do not know that modern studies have done anything to discredit it. . . . A man must be a very uncompromising partisan of the theory of the tabula rasa to deny that the ideas of first, second, and third are due to congenital tendencies of the mind. [1.374] I do not suggest that this passage represents Peirce's settled posi- tion with regard to the status of the categories. All I wish to emphasize is the explicitness of its affirmation of a transcendentalist position. IV. (c) For the final illustration of my thesis, I turn to Peirce's metaphysical speculations on the origin and evolution of the uni- verse. The first thing that must be noted is the marked ambival- ence in his views on the validity of the metaphysical enterprise. In the naturalistic frame of reference, where all concepts are de- fined pragmatically in terms of their experimental consequences (5.412, etc.), Peirce repeatedly affirms the futility of speculation. "A theory, which goes beyond what may be verified to any degree of approximation by future discoveries is, in so far, metaphysical gabble" (5.541). The pragmatic maxim, rigorously applied, serves to show "that almost every proposition of ontological metaphysics is either meaningless gibberish . . . or else is downright absurd" (5.423). The sound procedure is to sweep "all such rubbish" away, and leave to philosophy its proper subject-matter, viz., prob- lems capable of investigation by the observational methods of the true sciences. Since "all that ought to figure in a philosophical discussion involves, and turns upon, precise necessary reasoning" (5.8), pragmatism gives us "an expeditious riddance of all ideas essentially unclear" (5.206), by specifying the meaning of concepts in terms of their sensible or practical effects. Flights of speculative fancy are automatically ruled out of court. Elsewhere, Peirce expresses approval of a scientifically ori- entated metaphysics. To the objection that metaphysics is neces- sarily inscrutable because its objects are not open to observation, he replies that (a) "the things that any science discovers are be- yond the reach of direct observation," and (b) all metaphysics, even the "bad" variety, "rests on observations, whether consci- ously or not; and the only reason that this is not universally recog-</page><page sequence="9">NATURALISM AND TRANSCENDENTALISMll 373 nized is that it rests upon kinds of phenomena with which every man's experience is so saturated that he usually pays no particular attention to them" (6.2). Hence, "every man of us has a meta- physics, and has to have one; and it will influence his life greatly" (1.129). The sciences also make metaphysical assumptions (2.121). The proper attitude, therefore, is to recognize that metaphysics is an observational science which must use the method of induction and hypothesis in arriving at its conclusions. Only thus can it stop being "a mere arena of ceaseless and trivial disputation," and begin to yield solidly established and generally acceptable results. Peirce's metaphysical practice did not, of course, conform to these empirical specifications. His transcendental predilections led him to elaborate a cosmology, compounded of panpsychism, tychism, and a cosmic interpretation of evolution. The universe is pictured as having its origin in "a chaos of unpersonalized feeling" which began mysteriously to develop a tendency to form habits. From this, the process of growth or evolution started, and the world was launched on a course whose terminus can only be "an absolutely perfect, rational, and symmetrical system, in which mind is at last crystallized in the infinitely distant future" (6.33). The original chaos, however, was not an historical state; it did not exist, for "chaos is pure nothing" (5.431). It was the logical but not the chronological antecedent of existence (Secondness). Likewise, the final condition of the universe will be a non-existent state of perfect rationality (Thirdness) into which Firstness and Secondness will have been absorbed. From the human standpoint, then, pure inde- terminacy and the absolute reign of law represent merely ideal limits which speculative thought must postulate. For "at any assignable date in the past, however early, there was already some tendency toward uniformity; and at any assignable date in the future there will be some slight aberrancy from law" (1.409). The transcendentalist cast of all this becomes crystal clear when we note how Peirce links it with his doctrine of God. As certain unpublished fragments 4 from his early period show, Peirce was throughout his life a theist. The highly personal character of this belief tended to make his discussions of it cryptic and de- sultory. But among the considerations adduced in support of the hypothesis of God's reality are (a) that it satisfies the religious in- stinct or sentiment (6.429); (b) that it can be observationally verified (". . . as to God, open your eyes-and your heart, which is a perceptive organ-and you see him") (6.493); and (c) that it is the idea towards which the spontaneous, undirected play of thought, which Peirce calls "musement," naturally gravitates when 4 In the Archives, Widener Library, Harvard University.</page><page sequence="10">374 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY we contemplate the enormous complexity and variety of the cosmos (6.465). In this sense, the idea is the product of an abductive inference (6.484). Since it is at bottom an "instinctive belief" (6.501), the hy- pothesis of God's reality is bound to be vague. Nevertheless, it enables us to represent His nature in various ways-as an infinitely incomprehensible object (6.466), a disembodied spirit (6.489), Ens necessarium, "the creator of all three Universes of Experience" (6.452), the ultimate source of the law of love (6.449). Not only is God the originator of things, but their evolution is a progressive unfolding of His nature. Indeed, all reality is due to his creative power, which is still at work in the world (6.505). God is real, but he does not exist (6.495); and the traditional attributes of omniscience, omnipotence, and infallibility can only be attributed to Him in the vaguest sense (6.508-9). The universe, then, had its origin not in chance, but in God. He is the highest reality and the goal of the evolutionary process. "The starting point of the Universe, God the Creator, is the Abso- lute First; the terminus of the Universe, God completely revealed, is the Absolute Second; every state of the Universe at a measurable point of time is the Third" (1.362). Here we have the extreme point of Peirce's transcendentalism, the polar opposite of his na- turalism. When he is thus engaged in formulating a theology, one would never guess that he had described his philosophy elsewhere as "the attempt of a physicist to make such conjecture as to the constitution of the universe as the methods of science may permit" (1.7). In conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the aim of this paper has been simply to offer some evidence for the hypothesis that conflicting tendencies are to be found in Peirce. I believe this conflict to be a most important clue to the understanding of his thought. Nothing has been said about the possible sources of the two tendencies in the external circumstances of his life or the "inner dialectic" of his ideas. These are topics which require separate treatment. I may say, however, that I do not consider the tendencies to have been present in a fully developed form from the beginning of his career. Nor do I think they were of equal significance in determining his work. On the contrary, it seems clear that his naturalism was both stronger than his transcenden- talism, and also more fruitful in terms, of the constructive contribu- tions which resulted from it. Hence, the researches which occupied the bulk of his time, viz., logic and scientific method, show fewer traces of the basic conflict than, say, his metaphysics and ethics. Personally I do not find the presence of this conflict in his thought</page><page sequence="11">REASON AND EXISTENCE 375 a cause for regret. True, it prevented him from completing a tightly coherent system "in the grand manner." But had he al- ways sought to subordinate his reflections to the demands of such a system, we should probably not have that wealth of exciting and fruitful, but often random, "leads" in logic, semioties, scientific method, and phenomenology, for which we honor him today.
