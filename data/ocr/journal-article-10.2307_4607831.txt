<plain_text><page sequence="1">128 Bios The L-Factor: Toward an Operational Definition of Life BY WILLIAM L. REID III, ROBERT L. MARTIN, AND LEONARD GILLEY University of Maine at Farmington Farmington, ME 04938 If men would tell what ideas they make their words stand for, there could not be half that obscurity or wrangling in the search or support for truth that there is. -(Locke, 1690, Bk III, Ch 10.) By definition, the L-factor is a concatenation of the following: a system which captures energy from an external source, stores energy for continuous use within the system in the temporary absence of an external source, utilizes that energy to develop and maintain an or- ganization of matter which counteracts entropy, encodes and stores modifiable information necessary to control that organization and transmit and implement that information within the system and transmit it to subsequent systems, and responds to external stimuli. The presence or absence of the complete set of these observable at- tributes of the L-factor in any entity studied provides the basis for the judgment as to whether or not that entity is living; i.e., the total set of attributes yields a practical definition of life as a tool for the biologist. Defining Life When one looks at the history of the term life and at the human response to the difficulties encountered in attempting to provide a definition, it is not surprising to find modern encyclopedias reporting that there is no generally accepted definition. The term has, through time, acquired a multitude of meanings and undoubtedly even before Aristotle's speculations on the subject had a host of non-scientific usages. In spite of the vast accumulation of information concerning the processes involved and mechanisms utilized by living things, one finds scientists in chapter after chapter and book after book discussing life while continuing to state that it is not only impossible to define it, but that a definition is unimportant and not even useful. Add to the notion that it is beneath the dignity of serious scholars to engage in trivial semantic squabbling over such a definition, the already intim- idating plethora of meanings and the implication that there is a con- tinuum between non-living and living, there is little wonder that few scholars have had the temerity to attempt a definition. When the most recent textbooks in biology state that a definition of life cannot be given and then defend that inadequacy by stating that such a defini- tion would serve no useful purpose and should not be attempted, one may sense that the authors are stifling thoughtful inquiry in a pro-</page><page sequence="2">Bios 129 grammed fashion, much as a parent may respond to a child-"Don't ask silly questions!"-when faced with a query for which the parent has no answer. Utility of the L-Factor Definition For the L-factor to be useful as a tool for the biologist, it must be defined in a stipulative and operational manner. Precedence for stip- ulative defining is well-established in science-as, for example, in the restricted use of the term work by the physicist. If he allowed the multiple meanings of the term work to intrude upon the precise way it is to be used by him, it would lose its value as a tool. The physicist does not care how the term is employed elsewhere, as long as it retains its specific meaning in physics. Present knowledge of life on Earth allows us to provide a definition which not only describes life as it is currently understood but also may give insight into how both terrestrial and extra-terrestrial systems of matter can be evaluated. Those systems not possessing the complete set of attributes of the L-factor can be considered non-living regard- less of how closely they resemble life through possession of some but not all of the attributes. Those systems possessing all the attributes, even if utilizing different mechanisms from those currently found in Earth forms, will be considered living. To define life in such ways as "Life is God" and "Life is a mystery" is outside the scope of our endeavors: the purpose of our definition is to designate a clear set of attributes by which one can determine the applicability of the term life to any entity. Thus, the term L-factor is not synonymous with the term life, but provides a testable means of determing when the term life is appropriately applied to the entity examined. Therefore, an operational definition which provides test- able attributes is necessary for our purpose. Earth and the L-Factor On Earth, the attributes of the L-factor exist only in systems which are composed of complex organic molecules utilizing 24 of the known elements; which use water as the medium for organic reactions; which grow by complex chemical reactions rather than by accretion; which catalyze all chemical reactions by use of proteinaceous enzymes; which acquire energy from sunlight by photosynthetic action or by taking in energy-rich systems or products of systems, with the original source of the energy flowing through the systems having been produced by photosynthetic action; which utilize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as energy-currency for temporary energy storage within the system; which utilize energy to metabolically break down and build up the compo- nents of the system so that the organization of the system is main- tained, counteracting entropy as long as the system is open; which</page><page sequence="3">130 Bios code hereditary information in nucleic acids (DNA and RNA); which, because of the modifications available in the coded information trans- mitted to subsequent systems in the process called reproduction and because of the selective effects of the environment on the systems, can result in greater adaptation to the environment in subsequent systems in the process called evolution; and which carry out their functions in units called cells. To our knowledge, the smallest organized unit of matter on Earth possessing the L-factor is the cell, in accordance with the statement by Schleiden and Schwann that all living things are composed of cells and their products, the now well-known cell theory. Because the physical entity of the cell, albeit the apparently basic unit for Earth, is the vehicle for the functioning of the attributes of the L-factor, to include the cell or any of its parts as an actual attribute would be to include a specific Earth-limited mechanism as a narrow specification. This would be equally true for inclusion of parts of cells, as cell membranes or mitochondria. We have deliberately chosen not to in- clude the cell or its specific parts, for to specify mechanisms would change the operational definition we have developed to a listing of physical descriptors compiled from the entities on Earth which exhibit the L-factor. While such a listing does have value, it does not serve the purpose of our operational definition. One should note that most of the characteristics just described for the systems exhibiting the L-factor on Earth are mechanisms which carry out the functional attributes and, as such, are provincial. Dif- ferent mechanisms which are able to carry out those functions may well exist, even on this planet, and any restriction of the L-factor to a specific mechanism, such as requiring water to be the medium for organic reactions, appears arbitrarily restrictive. In addition, as im- portant as evolutionary processes are to the survival of successive generations of living entities, it is the complex attribute of coding, storing, and transmitting modifiable information that enables living entities to undergo evolution: evolution is thus a result of that attribute and does not constitute an attribute in itself. Some System Applications Although viruses and viroids utilize nucleic acids to code repro- ducibly the information which controls the organization of matter that provides life-sustaining attributes, they themselves do not possess the attributes of the L-factor. Their ability to reproduce by using the mechanisms available in living cells makes even that life-appearing attribute dependent upon the availability of a living system-a cell- for reproduction. Hence, there appears no reason to consider them to be alive: they do not possess the L-factor. The L-factor is also absent from infectious agents such as prions and the so-called slow viruses,</page><page sequence="4">Bios 131 for which there is currently no evidence of even the presence of nucleic acids. The ability of subcellular forms to alter the activities of living cells, while on occasion dramatically important to.humans, in no way provides evidence that those forms exhibit the L-factor. Thus, at this time, there is no evidence of the presence of the L-factor in organized units of matter smaller than the cell. It is the attribute of response to external stimuli which usually forms the basis for considering computers as potential life forms. Two prob- lems are associated with this attribute. The first is that this attribute, more than the others of the definition, shares with non-living entities a graded continuum of both the degree and kind of response exhib- ited. The non-scientist might be more likely to apply the term irrita- bility to a bottle of nitroglycerine than to a bacterium, and the property of sentience is certainly more demonstrable in a cat than in yeast cells. Attempts to qualify the attribute as modifiable and adaptive to separate it from the predictable fixed responses which occur during chemical and physical changes in non-living entities are not helpful, since the degree of modifiability varies greatly and responses of living organisms may be non-adaptive or of negative value, to individuals or groups. For that matter, modifications of response may be non- adaptive, such as in training a dog to bite all people wearing police uniforms. Any selection along the continuum of response in order to distinguish the living from the non-living would be totally arbitrary as well as insular. The second problem is in the common perception that the more human characteristics an entity possesses, the more alive it must be. In spite of that perception, the development of memory, emotions, and intelligence do not make the entity possessing these characteris- tics any more alive than an entity not possessing them: a human being with a brain is no more alive than a yeast cell without a brain. How- ever, it may go beyond simple anthropomorphism to an expression of egotism for humans to wish to consider a computer alive because of its ability to exhibit intelligence, a characteristic which is not common in all life forms. Although the modern Functionalist approach to a philosophy of mind in the cognitive sciences recognizes the possibility of mental states outside of living cells, even in non-physical entitities, the pos- session of such mental states is not an attribute of living things. Even if a test could prove that computers and disembodied spirits (if exis- tent) could feel pain, they would be no closer to being considered alive than any other entity which lacks that mental state. While it may be intellectually stimulating to postulate the conditions under which a computer could be considered living, we suggest that reference be made to the attributes of the L-factor. A computer utilizing protein- aceous microchips manufactured by bacteria through genetic engi- neering would be no more alive than one utilizing silicon microchips,</page><page sequence="5">132 Bios but a computer utilizing storage batteries developed and maintained by the computer would possess an attribute making it more like a living entity. Loss of the L-Factor Death, sometimes characterized as being the loss of life, occurs when a system ceases to maintain the attributes of life, whether in single cells or in a multi-cellular entity. The point at which this loss is perceived to occur may be determined quite differently by physi- cians, lawyers, theologians, and philosophers. In a multi-cellular or- ganism there is variation from the time of death of the organism as an entity to the time of cellular death: think of the example of a chicken with its head cut off in which the cells, tissues, and organs are demonstrably living long after the total organism is considered to be dead. The importance humans attach to time in such determina- tions is shown by the requirement that the human donor of a heart for transplanting be considered dead, while it is equally imperative that the heart tissue be living. The loss of a system's maintenance of the attributes of life as de- fined by the L-factor may be temporary, to be regained later-as in the freezing of some arctic fishes and the ametabolic periods of some rotifers. For those people to whom the idea of intermittent life is repugnant, the term "suspension of life" might be more acceptable, with its implication that the system is retaining the ability to carry out the attributes while not carrying them out during the time period in which they are not being exhibited. Choosing a Method of Definition Life scientists, sometimes unaware of the options open to them as definers, can mistakenly think it would be impossible to generate any acceptable definition of the term life. It is actually easy to generate definitions of the term. An ostensive definition, such as "Life is the condition found in the pandas, alligators, and peacocks at the National Zoo," is an acceptable definition which gives a representative list of instances displaying the property life. It is not exhaustive nor does it state essence, but it has its uses in certain situations. A synonymous definition of life, such as "Life is being alive," is satisfactory for cer- tain purposes. Perhaps a lexical definition-one that states how the term is used in a language-will serve one's end: The American Her- itage Dictionary of the English Language (1976, p. 754), specifies life as "the interval between birth or inception of an organism and its death." It is not difficult to develop acceptable definitions of the term life, for acceptability often depends on the purpose they are to serve. However, most biologists would like a definition to express the es- sence of the referent of the term. They want to know what life is. We</page><page sequence="6">Bios 133 will show that at least in the case of a posteriori terms like life, we cannot have such definitions. Perfectly sound, perfectly acceptable definitions, of their kind, can be given of life, such as the three pre- sented in this paragraph. And a perfectly effective operational defi- nition of that set of features common to what most assuredly lives can be given as well. It is wrong to say that life cannot be defined. Consult almost any informal logic text and one can see the method we have used to fashion our definition and the weaknesses we have tried to avoid (Copi, 1961; Rescher, 1964). It is clear this is neither an enumerative nor ostensive definition, for we have indicated no ex- amples of life. We have not pursued a genus-difference route, nor constructive, nor synonymous. We have not followed a generic nor abbreviative route either. An operational definition states a test or operation that, when per- formed, will indicate whether or not the term is applicable to the entity or class of entities being tested. From a scientific perspective, an operational definition has great potential use. Einstein's relativity theory defined space and time as measuring operations for times and distances, and major advances in genetics in the 1950's were due, in part, to the use of operational definitions. Our definition is operational to the degree that we name attribute-tests, rather than specify, at length, the actual operations that should be performed to determine the pres- ence of the L-factor properties. To give a detailed description of the experiments necessary to ascertain the presence of the function-attri- butes would require a much more extensive treatment than we can offer here. Our definition is also stipulative, for it offers a new meaning for a new term. Stipulative definitions are not judged as to their truth or falsity. We will not try to sort out the multifarious meanings of the term life. In fact, we argue that, for scientific purposes, no definition based on analysis of the uses of the term life is possible. Instead, an empirically testable set of function-attributes, the L-factor, in the form of a stipulative, operational definition is suitable for scientific pur- poses. We regard our definition to be open to substitution as new information is discovered, in much the same manner that hypotheses in science are developed through insight, imagination, and a solid background in the subject matter. A definition explains the meaning of a term. An operational defi- nition should make sense, avoid circularity, be clear, consistent, and literal. Since our definition sets the range of application of the term life by specifying the operations or experiments one must perform to determine the applicability of the term to any entity in question, our definition is neither too wide nor too narrow. It is important for a dictionary maker to catch and put down the actual uses of the term in the language. Since ours is not lexical, one should not expect to have encountered the L-factor and its definition</page><page sequence="7">134 Bios before. With time, this definition, or a modification of it, could work its way into our language and then have a lexical meaning. We have not attempted to state what the nature or essence of life is. We reject any assertion that we have done that. The Structure of the L-Factor Definition We have structured our definition in the following way: for any entity X, X can be properly said to be T if and only if X, upon testing, has been found to have attribute PI, attribute P2, and so on to attribute pn, We include any observable attribute that is common to all in- stances of the class. It is important to realize that for X to be called T it is necessary that all attributes in the set, p1 to pn, satisfy the test operations. Absence of one or more P's from X disqualifies it from being called T. Another way to state this relationship: for the state- ment that X is called T to be true, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that the set of attributes P', and P2, and so on to pn are true of X. To express this relationship yet another way: if something is to be called T, it must satisfy all the tests for the attributes specified; and, if something does, it can be called T. Our rule for attribute inclusion is: any attribute P, not derivable from those attributes already present in the definition, common to all instances to be considered as T, shall be included in the definition. Each attribute is independent. Hence, in our definition, the attribute of "captures energy from an external source," is not derivable from "encodes and stores modifiable information necessary to control that organization," nor vice versa. Our definition is meant to fit into an interpreted system, not to hang in a limbo of symbols. If new attributes are discovered, they should be included in a new definition. Difficulties with Essence We have found that most people think of defining life as an attempt to explain what life is. To discover what those features characteristic of living things are, features which distinguish the things alive from non-living, would be to state their essence. When one can express what makes anything the sort of thing it is-for example, what makes mice and marigolds alive-one has fulfilled a traditional goal of the definition maker. Let us say we want to discover the essential meaning of term T, that meaning that is common to all instances of T. To do this, we must examine cases in which T is used correctly-that is, those instances where T names something that manifests the essence of T. Correctly identified cases provide us with the basis for our search. To determine which cases of T are those of correct naming, we might say that we use our knowledge of T's essence to cull from the list of examples</page><page sequence="8">Bios 135 any incorrect cases of use of the term. Since we do not know the essence of T, we cannot reliably cull the list. If we are to select the proper examples from which we will derive the essential features, we must have a method of selection. If we could accurately choose a set of examples that would be neither too wide nor too narrow, we would already know the essence. If we were unable to choose the proper examples of T's use, we could not be certain that the essence we discover is proper-if we discover any. Since we either know or do not know the essence, we would be doing something unnecessary if we knew it or inconclusive if we did not. To render a precise definition of the term life-one which would capture the essence of it and for which no counter examples could be found-we would have to examine a range of instances that in- cludes and clearly distinguishes living things from the non-living. To make a thorough and complete selection would require prior knowl- edge of the nature of life. This is knowledge we are in search of and do not have. The structure of our definition suggests further reasons why we do not attempt to express the essence of the term life and why our defi- nition is a stipulative, operational one. First of all, if there are essential properties-properties any X must have to be the type of thing it is- then they would all be present in every case of X named T. If one is missing in some likely candidate for use of the term T, then it is clearly not a case of T. Yet notice that if property P5, let us say, is present in all instances, its presence is no guarantee that P5 is an essential prop- erty-that is, there is no certainty P5 is absolutely necessary for the being of any X that is T. Property P5 could be an accidental attibute that is present by chance in all instances of T examined. However, P5 is necessary for us to call any X an instance of T. Certainly P5 would be part of the definition. We would not regard any entity hav- ing all but P5 as an instance of T. If P5 is an essential property of any instance named T, that P5 iS present in all instances that are named T-but this does not imply the converse: if P5 is present in all instances of X named T, then P5 is an essential property of any instance named T. We could not be certain that P5 is an essential property; hence, we could not be sure that a definition of T that attempts to express the essence of T expresses only the essential properties of T. For example, even if all Ford cars produced before 1920 were black, it was not necessary for them to have been that color. Consider this: pN means that set of attribute names used in the definition of term T; pE means that set of essential attributes belonging to any X that can be called T. If a definition were to precisely state the essence of that referred to by the term, pN and pE would be equivalent: i.e., every attribute name designates an essential attribute and every essential attribute would be named. Our definition is such that it may or may not be the case that pN is equivalent to pE. There is no assurance that any attrib-</page><page sequence="9">136 Bios ute in our definition is essential. To think in terms of essence and essential attributes is neither productive nor necessary. There may be no such things as essences or essential attributes. If they exist and are instantiated in physical entities, they are very hard to discover. The question of the metaphysical status of essential prop- erties and natures is outside the scope of our work. Nevertheless, we can proceed to form an operational definition, without being con- cerned with stating essences, by identifying observable properties held in common by members of the class of things to be defined. We can then determine the proper operations or experiments needed to as- certain the presence of these attributes in any entity or class of enti- ties, and then state the definition. Second, it is important to recognize that a property that is inherent in all X's accurately named T, present by virtue of X's essential nature, may not occur in the list of P's because it has not been discovered. This P would be required for an essential definition. It would be unreasonable to think that all essential features of life have already been found. We have been discussing essential attributes or properties of X that we might try to discover and express in a definition. Grant for a mo- ment that we find such attributes. A third difficulty still exists: we would be no closer to knowing the nature of that which has these essential properties than when we began. What is the nature of the entity that has the set of essential P's? No fully satisfying answer can be given-for, with this question, we have emerged from the forest of logic and life sciences and we are gazing at that long-fought-over philosophical battleground of metaphysical substance, a muddy plain with little living vegetation, poorly mapped, with land mines and oth- er hidden dangers. In the Platonic dialogues in which Socrates is found hunting for essential definitions of terms-for example, justice in the Republic, courage in the Laches, knowledge in the Theaetetus-those persons who try to satisfy his desire to find these meanings usually fail. Often, the failure is due to a definition that is either too wide or too narrow. Consider Laches' definition: "... he is a man of courage who does not run away, but remains at his post and fights against the enemy (Plato, Steph. 190 D). Socrates points out that the Scythians and Spar- tans fight well, courageously, and often to victory by leaving their posts and retreating. The fact that there is an instance of courageous action not covered by Laches' statement shows his definition is too narrow. Socrates' search is for a type that can be considered true or false. His search is for definitions that express the essence found in all instances of the term. He says to Laches, "I meant to ask you not only about the courage of heavy-armed soldiers, but about the courage of cavalry and every other style of soldier. And not only who are cou-</page><page sequence="10">Bios 137 rageous in war, but who are courageous in perils by sea, and who in disease, or in poverty, or again in politics, are courageous; and not only who are courageous against pain or fear, but mighty to contend against desires and pleasures, either fixed in their rank or turning upon their enemy. There is this sort of courage-is there not, Laches? ... Now I was asking about courage and cowardice in general ... What is that common quality, which is the same in all these cases, and which is called courage?" (Plato, Steph. 191 C-D.) This is a search for what we will call a Socratic definition. Laches and his friends do not achieve success, and failure is the usual case in other Platonic dialogues where the search is for the qualities or characteristics common to all uses of terms derived a posteriori. There may be little dispute about the meaning of such a priori concepts as "rectangle" and "prime number," but to discover the meaning of "justice," "piety," "good," "beauty," or "love" is dif- ficult. We believe that Socrates' quest for essences was destined to be inconclusive. We do not know if a stipulative definition, such as we have offered for the L-factor, could have helped him. Probably not. A philosophical view critical of the tendency to search for one So- cratic meaning in similar uses of a term is found in Wittgenstein's discussion of family resemblance meanings for names. In his discus- sions, one finds a plausible explanation of why some see the appli- cation of the term life extending to non-cellular forms. People did not suddenly invent the word life. The term acquired its meaning by accretion, over centuries. N. W. Pirie in "The Meaninglessness of the Terms Life and Living" (1939), writes: "'life' and 'living' are clearly words that the scientist has borrowed from the plain man. The loan has worked satisfactorily until comparatively recently, for the scientist seldom cared and certainly never knew just what he meant by these words, nor for that matter did the plain man." (Pirie, 1939, p. 12.) In The Blue Book (1965) and Philosophical Investigations (1968), Wittengstein explains a feature of language that belongs to some names: the things named possess no one essential set of qualities, but rather share a family resemblance. The human craving for generality, he says, results from certain tendencies and philosophical confusions. Of particular interest for our discussion is the tendency to look for some attribute or set of attributes common to all things to which people apply the same name-which we call the Socratic tendency. Family resemblance names occur frequently. Wittgenstein discuss- es the term game. Other examples of family resemblance terms are home, course, university, work, happiness, justice, play, strength. An example of a term acquiring new family members at an accelerated rate is disease. There are bacterial and viral diseases, mental diseases, genetic diseases. Alcoholism was once considered a moral failing, not a disease. The list of conditions covered by the term is growing. Before</page><page sequence="11">138 Bios genetics was understood, there were no ailments named genetic dis- eases, nor were there any diseases named fungal, bacterial, or para- sitic before the discovery of these agents. Just as game is a difficult term to define, disease as a term challenges the definition maker to find a commonality among a vast array of resemblings. There is no possibility of stating the one unifying set of features common to all things that can be a family resemblance term. There is no such set. This is why it was so often impossible to satisfy Socrates! For example, aside from being called diseases, there is no common set of essential features in gid, alcoholism, sickle-cell anemia, kleptomania, bubonic plague, founder, lung cancer, tourne, ringworm, senility, kuru, and damping-off. The term life is in the class of family resemblance names. There is a tendency to let the term name things that are like the clearest ex- amples of life. Computers seem to exhibit the rational procedures we are familiar with in humans; hence, some people may consider com- puters to be alive. An age-old topic of discussion is extra-terrestrial life. There are the expressions divine life, vertebrate life, army life, and life after death. There is also atomic half-life, auto-battery life, tire life, and life in tennis balls. Scientists value the clarity of their concepts and resist the tendency to build family resemblance names. It is particularly unproductive to blur a major concept. Precise and unambiguous terms are required before any rational systematization is possible and before any philo- sophical unification of the sciences can be undertaken. It is important to restrict the term life to clear instances. Because cells and systems of cells exhibit a common set of attributes, we have no scientific need to change the term L-factor into a family resem- blance name: facts concerning the nature and identity of prions, vi- ruses, DNA, and RNA will not change even if they are outside of the scope of the L-factor. We understand why some people are inclined to call computers, robots, viroids, and viruses living; they share resem- blances, even attributes, with instances of life. Some entities replicate, others seem to think, still others seem to respire as living things do. People tend to notice resemblances and where they see them they often call those resembling things by the same name. One problem that discourages potential definers of life arises from the claim that no definition of the term is possible because there is no clear boundary which distinguishes the living from the non-liv- ing-a situation rather like asking at what point the light spectrum changes from yellow to green. The more scientists look for primitive lifelike forms, the more life seems to merge with the non-living inert stuff around us. Life appears to extend down into what conventional wisdom says life cannot. We do not desire to arbitrarily draw the line at the cell and remain there. Nevertheless, we maintain that life on Earth is found, at pres-</page><page sequence="12">Bios 139 ent, only in single cells and in ordered groups of them. Other enti- ties-viruses, massive protein molecules, viroids, prions, and com- puters-do not exhibit the L-factor. Leibniz's dictum "Nature never takes leaps" is wrong. If all things are alive, if life shades asymptotically into matter, if everything is alive to some degree, then those properties common to all living things would be only those properties common to physical things in their simplest form. Neither replication nor respiration could be counted as properties. It violates common sense to say that the salient features of the most obvious instances of living things-reproduction, energy intake, response to external stimuli-are not needed for life. Simple, apparently non-living material things do not show all the features of things usually regarded as being alive. We would have to say that one common set of attributes is essential for life in moose, chickadees, lobsters, algae, roses, white pine trees, mushrooms, yeast, granite blocks, gold bars, and piles of sand. These entities take up space, exist in time, are composed of atoms, respond to environment, have shape, and can be numbered; one would as soon call a steel bar alive as call a man alive. The vague and tenuous speculation that the responsive- ness common to living things extends down to the simplest entities in the physical world is a weak basis for concluding that all physical things are alive. Ironically, it would be more convincing and equally fallacious to argue that since all things commonly regarded as living have shape, then all things with shape are living! Why People Resist Defining Life There are many biologists with negative attitudes toward defining life. Bentley Glass in Explanations in Biology (1969, p. 48), writes "Biology is the science of life but what 'life' itself is we cannot define in precise operational terms." In the Encyclopedia Britannica (1974, p. 893), one finds "There is no generally accepted definition of life." In a statement that might discourage genus-difference definers, Bern- stein and Bernstein in Biology: The Study of Life (1982, p. 49), write "How do living things differ from non-living things? ... we do not have a definitive answer to this question." Of defining the terms living and dead, Medawar and Medawar in The Life Science (1977, p. 7), write "Such exercises would certainly take place if they served any useful purpose but, except in certain marginal cases mentioned be- low, they do not." In The Future of Man (1960, p. 108), Peter Medawar writes "Discussions about (for example) the 'real' meaning of the words living and dead are felt to mark a low level in biological conversation. These words have no inner meaning which careful study will even- tually disclose." Perhaps the Medawars missed a worthwhile observation in Pirie's article: "A discussion is surely not sterile if it leads to an increase in</page><page sequence="13">140 Bios the precision of language by deciding how life may be recognized, even if it should fail, metaphysically, to decide what it is." (Pirie, 1939, p. 12) From the beginning, we have made it clear that we cannot state the metaphysical features of life, its essence, but we hold that a cred- ible operational definition can be given that is of practical value in the life sciences. The reluctance or neglect on the part of biologists to rationally delineate their foundation concepts seems evident to us. It is ironic that a person can study a topic for years and even write articles and books about the subj ect without attempting to specify with any degree of rigor the nature of the subject. This resistance to defining life has several possible causes. First, the logic of definition is not commonly understood by most biologists. Second, it is generally unimportant for a researcher in a narrow field of the life sciences to consider the term life. Third, the importance of a definition of life as a link between the life sciences and other sci- ences may not be readily apparent. Fourth, the traditional exercise in uninformed skepticism found in textbooks and in college lectures of trying to frame a definition by serially citing possible attributes of life and then finding examples regarded as non-living while possessing these attributes often intimidates or discourages would-be definition makers. Fifth, the deprecation of the whole enterprise by leading scholars in the field is often stultifying. Sixth, the apparent lack of a demarcation between life and the non-living makes the possibility of a successful definition seem remote. Many people who throw up their hands or turn thumbs down are looking for an essential definition. The term life, with its family re- semblance nature, and the general epistemological problems associ- ated with framing any essential definition of an empirically derived term, in effect precludes hope of generating a definition that expresses the essential features of life. One has to be satisfied with something else. In spite of objections raised by many people against the possibility of defining life, we have provided the scientist with a tool by means of which an entity may be judged to be living or non-living.
