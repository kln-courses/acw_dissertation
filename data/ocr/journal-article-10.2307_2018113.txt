Although this book is composed of articles and reviews previ- ously published in various periodicals, it is not without a certain unity. More than two-thirds of it is devoted to an extremely ad- verse judgment of various forms and phases of Marxism, while even in those chapters which deal with rather unrelated topics, ani- madversions against Marxism, especially as understood in Soviet Russia, continually reappear. Professor Hook defines his "task as primarily a critical analysis of . . . scientifically inadequate ways of belief. " The greatest cause of intellectual confusion, he states, "is the use of unanalyzed and unanalyzable abstractions in our speech," and he insists, as most philosophers would, that statements containing the term "lib- erty" acquire meaning only when translated into other sentences in which "liberty" is replaced by liberty to invest, liberty to eat, etc. But the formula to distinguish a legitimate from an illegiti- mate abstraction is disappointing. How we can "cancel the term 'liberty' from every statement in the set of translated statements without in any way altering their meaning " is far from clear. "We are dealing with a legitimate abstraction," the author states, "if it is possible to interpret the sentence in which it occurs into another sentence in which that abstraction no longer appears as a term. " But suppose other abstractions such as democracy or equality were introduced in place of "liberty" in the new state- ment. Evidently the formula would have to be revised to exclude this possibility, for it is easy enough to get rid of one abstraction</page><page sequence="2">244 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY by introducing others. And yet one could not exclude all abstrac- tions either. Evidently a distinction is needed. Another sug- gested criterion of a legitimate abstraction, quite different from the above, and having difficulties all its own, is that an abstraction is legitimate when the statement in which it occurs can be tested ex- perimentally. The difficulty here hangs on the interpretation of experiment. If the term is understood in a strict laboratory sense, important parts of science seem to be excluded as meaningless. If it is not understood in this sense, the notion of a testable statement remains hazy and inexact. Further light is thrown on testability in a discussion of means and ends. All social ideals, according to Professor Hook, are hy- potheses which specify the means and changes to be employed for their realization and are such that "the verifiable consequences of such means and changes will coincide with the forseen conse- quences" (p. 30). This evokes a number of questions: Isn't it a little awkward to speak of the ideal of higher living standards for the American people as an hypothesis? And if ideals specify the means to be used, aren't the ideals of A and B necessarily different if they recommend different means? Finally, although it is highly desirable to know in advance that the means we employ will bring about the desired result in the future, it is surely not essential to an ideal. Would it follow that the great utopian figures of the past had no ideals because the means they conceived were inade- quate or lacking in concreteness? Or is it not rather the case that the very absence of adequate means to the actualization of an ideal is historically, very often, a spur to the discovery of such means. It will be remembered that Engels, defending the great utopians Saint Simon, Fourrier, and Owen, stated that most of the later ideals of socialism are to be found in their writings. Professor Hook apparently takes a different view. "Whenever," he says, "ends and means are not related, ends cannot be tested," and if the ends can not be tested, the ideal is apparently meaningless. The intimate bond between ends and means, in his view, is illus- trated by the following: "Whenever anyone says, 'My ends are good but my means are bad' we have every right to reply, 'Your ends are never any better than your means' for we can only judge by what we observe, and we observe that it is not your words which have effects upon the world but your acts, i.e., your means" (p. 30). If it is safe to assume that the main thought in this pas- sage is not that actions speak louder than words., let us confine our attention to the statement "your ends are never any better than your means." Certainly in ordinary language, means to good ends may be bad, i.e., undesirable. Thus a war resulting in na-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 245 tional liberation or the emancipation of slaves may be cruel and devastating. If of course means were stipulated good or bad ex- clusively in terms of the end which they subserve, then the war in question would become, by definition, good or desirable. But this usage would be clearly out of line with the common judgment that means which serve good ends are frequently bad in themselves. A cognate point arises in the course of Professor Hook's for the most part very acceptable criticism of Thurman Arnold's The Folklore of Capitalism. Arnold does take a very cavalier atti- tude toward morals in politics. One feels with Professor Hook that politics is exactly the place where more morality is needed, and more analysis of it. Yet Mr. Arnold admits that in develop- ing techniques of political control, he presupposes a set of values which are undefined. He only doubts whether there is any ad- vantage in definitions in such cases, whether starting out with a definition of "the good life" is the best beginning for the political analyst. At this point, the difference between his position and Hook's is not as clear as it seemed before. For Hook states: "Ideals or values . . . are hypotheses about the forseen con- sequences of striving or acting in a certain way. They are true or false if the actual consequences which ensue agree or disagree with the forseen consequences. But, someone is sure to ask, are the actual consequences themselves good?" (p. 29). Hook denies that there is an absolute standard by which they can be judged. And the question arises: Is there any standard at all except suc- cess? The view that the only standard is success or confirmation is attractively simple and clear, but apparently false, while the view that there is another standard of good and bad consequences, although not an absolute standard, has not been developed in the book. The truth of Hook's contention is his rejection of an abso- lute, unchanging standard. These methodological points are important because they are put forward as the basis of later political criticisms which make up a large part of the book. A more important criterion of right- ness and wrongness, in the opinion of the reviewer, is the stipula- tion that no act of an individual, institution, or state can be ad- judged right or wrong except in relation to the concrete alternatives available at the unique moment of time, with its relevant particu- lars and specific circumstance. In order to certify an act as wrong one must present a plausible concrete alternative which would produce more good. The failure to apply this principle, which Professor Hook no doubt accepts, is understandable in view of the difficulties, but also a very regrettable aspect of the book. Very</page><page sequence="4">246 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY rarely, if ever, does he delineate in concrete form better alternatives to the course of action which he condemns. This is illustrated by the chapters on Marxism but also, to some extent, in the chapter on Maritain 's integral humanism. While Hook scores a number of points against Maritain's position and ingeniously sets forth certain embarrassments of the liberal Catho- lic, he also falls into a number of overstatements. For example, he asserts that "M. Maritain cannot in principle condemn the aspi- ration of the Catholic Church to monopoly of temporal power with- out falling into heresy; . . ." In the section on Marxism many such statements occur. Hook says, for example, that "Whenever Trotsky's position is supported by empirical evidence, its implications are in flat contradiction to the orthodox Marxism by which he unnecessarily seeks to justify it" (p. 152). Often he seems to imply that his various adversaries have no empirical evidence whatsoever to support their views. No proof is given for "As far as real wages is concerned, the worker under Czarism was better off than he is under Stalin," although much research on the subject is available. Some views expressed in the chapters on Marxism are entirely acceptable. One is in perfect accord with his statement that "If it is a battle for socialism, then it is a battle not only for higher production but for the democratic way of life in industry, politics and education" (p. 175). What is said about the inevitability of socialism is probably right in the main. There is always the possi- bility, at least, that the increasing ills of capitalism will eventu- ate, not in socialism, but in some other non-capitalist order in which the ruling class would control profits and investments while re- ducing labor to serfdom. Hobson envisaged some such a possibil- ity at the beginning of the century. But the internal weakness and instability of any system of the kind are fairly obvious. In any case, the Marxists would probably do better to express the inevitability theory (as I believe some do) in terms of probability. In a chapter on "Dialectic and Nature" Hook argues that seven meanings of "dialectic" are to be found in Engels' writings, that they are perhaps, with one exception, untenable and inconsistent among themselves. The seven meanings are: Dialectic as universal and objective, as the logic of transition, as the logic of disjunc- tion, as polar opposition, as subjective dialectic, as organic inter- relation, and as scientific method. While this classification is not without value, it is certainly possible to interpret the seven de- scriptions not as different meanings of dialectic, but rather as different aspects of one conception. Furthermore, if some incon- sistencies can be shown in Engels' interpretation of scientific</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEW 247 method, it is always possible that they are verbal, such as are frequently found in the interpretations of other schools of phi- losophy. However, a special difficulty seems to haunt dialectical materialism; since it attempts to interpret even logic as a natural science (deriving the logical notion of contradiction, for example, from the experienced oppositions in the material world) it is obliged to relinquish the luxury enjoyed by other schools of relying on neat logical dichotomies. Unfortunately, these dichotomies, which are of course indispensable and of immense value, appear to exist only in abstract logical systems, in thought constructions, and to be extremely scarce in nature. The conviction that there is a great deal of truth in dialectic, in spite of difficulties in formulating it accurately, is attested to by a mass of literature which goes back to Heraclitus and Zeno. E-ven at the present time it is remarkable to observe how many different currents of philosophy, having no relation to Marx or Hegel, are moving toward non-Aristotelian logic and dialectic (see Oliver L. Reiser's The Promise of Scientific Humanism, N. Y., 1940). No doubt this long tradition, like others, is strewn with blunders and misconceptions. The old Eleatic arguments against motion are difficult to uphold today, and Professor Hook follows a well-beaten path in his criticism of them. In so far as Engels gave his sup- port to them, he was almost certainly wrong, but Hegelian tradition and the time at which he lived would help to explain his position. Another point of attack is Engels' interpretation of a problem which has been a riddle to many philosophers: the relation between contradiction, reality, and truth. Hook, for example, raises the following interesting difficulty: "If all existence is self-contradic- tory and, as Engels holds, all correct thinking is an image or re- flection of things, then consistency would be an unfailing sign of falsity" (p. 203). It is possible, of course, that Engels' language does at times suggest such a difficulty. The following interpreta- tion, however, could be made: Consistent thinking so-called is thinking which takes place on certain levels of abstraction. It contains truth, but not the whole truth; it reflects reality but not the full dialectical movement of reality, because it assumes in dis- course logical dichotomies which probably do not exist in nature. This is why consistent thinking, as we have known it, so frequently falls into contradictions and has to set up new dichotomies more closely approximating the objective world. The peculiarity of dialectical thinking is not that it strives to make contradictions but that it seeks to understand and to anticipate them. To reflect contradictions is not to commit them. Advancing movements of thought, too, are contradictory in an understandable sense-in the</page><page sequence="6">248 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Socratic sense. Ever new definitions and dichotomies approxi- mating reality in various degrees are set up only to be discarded when their inadequacy or contradictoriness is discovered. Thus both Hegel and Engels continually invoke the laws of contradic- tion and excluded middle to goad thought on, as it were, to closer approximations to reality. As Professor Dewey says (Logic, The Theory of Inquiry): the canon of excluded middle "expresses a condition to be satisfied." But he does not suggest that it ever has been satisfied. It is a heuristic principle, not ontological. He states that "the notion that propositions are or can be, in and of themselves, such that the principle of excluded middle directly ap- plies is probably the source of more fallacious reasoning in philo- sophical discourse and in moral and social inquiries than any one sort of fallacy." The same appears to be true of the law of con- tradiction. It also could be regarded as a heuristic principle guid- ing thought to new discoveries, closer approximations, and not an ontological principle. Although some passages may suggest it, it is very doubtful that Engels meant to say that dialectic is the only method of proof. What he probably meant was that other fruitful methods, i.e., methods which are only partly dialectical, are incomplete. His was no crass rejection of customary research techniques and ex- perimental methods, but only a desire to improve them. Thus Hook's charge of inconsistency between Engels' supposed claim that all valid thinking is dialectical and his admission that there are other methods of proof is somewhat unconvincing (p. 185). Dia- lectic can be conceived as including all partially valid methods of proof. The reviewer agrees with Professor Hook that "dialectic as scientific method" is the most promising description of Engels' dialectic, while refusing to restrict Engels' merits to the strictly empiricist elements in his thought. Professor Hook also seems to be in the right when he insists that anthropomorphic and sociomorphic terms or implications are out of place in the language of a dialectic which applies to nature as well as to society. There is nothing anomalous in this, of course. Terms such as "attraction" and "repulsion," for example, have long been used in physical descriptions. On the other hand, refor- mulations and new designations would doubtless increase accuracy in a number of instances. Hook is probably also right in taking ex- ception to some of Engels' illustrations of contradictions in mathe- matics although, of course, imaginary numbers and infinitesimals are much better understood today than they could have been in Engels' time. But often the argument is hard to follow. In dis- cussing Engels' law of the transformation of quantity into qual-</page><page sequence="7">BOOK NOTES 249 ity, Hook rightly states that such a transformation, as of water into steam, may not make a difference to the physicist who is sterilizing his instruments (p. 219), but it is most difficult to see how this conflicts in any way with the law. Again, the sudden appearance of a qualitative change in one series is not by itself a guarantee of a similar change in other series, but is not this pre- cisely Engels' view? Dialectical laws can be applied only when the relevant concrete facts are known and the appropriate tech- niques utilized. In this respect they are like other laws. In other respects-their very general form and the difficulty of formu- lating them abstractly-they bear a close resemblance to the so- called "law of uniformity." The chapter on "Nature and Dialectic," which is probably the best in the book, is followed by brief and scattered criticisms of H. Levy, J. B. S. Haldane, and various other writers who have taken an interest in dialectic or Marxism, and the book concludes with a very short chapter on "The Democratic Way of Life." Although it is composed almost entirely of criticism, negative in emphasis, the book has the merit of presenting again questions which are always in need of further study. If it fails to evoke the serenity which is supposed to come from seeing things steadily and whole in all their relations, it succeeds in exciting thought. V. J. McGILL.
