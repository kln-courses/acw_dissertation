<plain_text><page sequence="1">The purpose of this section is to make the literature devel- oped by the Society more useful to the engineering com- munity. This is done in three ways. A SUBJECT INDEX containing all the literature produced during the year. Each individual paper or piece of literature is listed several times under the subject headings that are appropriate to its technical content. The TITLE of each paper has been edited when necessary (for this listing only) so that it more fully reflects the scope of the paper. An AUTHOR INDEX follows the subject index. In both the SUBJECT and AUTHOR index, the same six digit code number used for the abstract is given, so the full abstract can be found and read.

Most papers are published separately in booklet form. How- ever, from time to time groups of papers on the same subject are grouped together in one "Special Publication." Papers presented before each Conference of the Society are published together in a "Proceedings." The following list cross-refer- ences the six-digit code number with the Proceedings volume number (P) or the Special Publication number (SP).
