THE PRESENCE OF MODIFIED GRANULAR GLANDS IN MALE AND FEMALE ANEIDES LUGUBRIS (AMPHIBIA: PLETHODONTIDAE) NANCY L. STAUB AND JULIE PALADIN Biology Department, Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA 99258, USA ABSTRACT: Both male and female Aneides lugubris possess modified granular glands posterior to the cloaca. These glands are morphologically and histochemically similar to courtship glands that are found only in sexually mature males of other plethodontid species. Gland size is sexually di- morphic; glands are significantly larger in males than in females. Although these glands stain simi- larly to courtship glands, their function in A. lugubris is presently not known. Key words: Caudata; Plethodontidae; Aneides; Glands; Histology; Sexual dimorphism AMPHIBIANS are characterized by moist glandular skin. In addition to mucous and granular (serous or poison) glands, some members of the family Plethodontidae possess courtship glands (see Houck and Sever, 1993, for a review). Courtship glands are simple acinar glands embedded in the stratum spongiosum of the dermis. They can occur in a submandibular cluster called the mental gland, in a dorsal tail base cluster, or scattered individually across the body. Because courtship glands are typically expressed in sexually mature males and are known to be influenced by testosterone (Noble, 1931; Sever, 1976; Staub, 1991), courtship glands have been considered to be sexually dimorphic. No- ble (1929), however, reported an exception to this general pattern of sexual dimor- phism. Based on visual inspection of fe- males of Aneides lugubris and Aneides aenens, he described the presence of he- donic glands, subsequently renamed courtship glands (Arnold, 1977), as "yel- lowish spots" scattered across the body. Our goal was to investigate the presence of these glands on the ventral tail surface in males and females of A. lugubris using histochemical techniques. In contrast to the fibrous secretory product of mucous glands, the secretory product of both courtship and granular glands is granular. Courtship glands were described histologically by Noble (1929) as a gland type distinct from mucous and granular glands. They can be distinguished from granular glands by a strongly positive periodic acid-Schiff reaction (Sever, 1989). Courtship glands were initially named he- donic glands (Noble, 1929). Arnold (1977) suggested that the anthropomorphic term hedonic be avoided, because it implies that these glands are "pleasure-giving" which is not testable. He suggested the name "courtship gland" instead, because it is known that these glands are used in courtship. Caudal (tail base) courtship glands were first studied in several species of the pleth- odontid genus Eurycea (Sever, 1985, 1989). In Eurycea, these glands occur in a cluster on the dorsal tail surface and are thought to function during the tail strad- dling walk of courtship. Caudal courtship glands have been identified in Plethodon cinereus as well (Simons, 1992). Ventral courtship glands in several plethodontid genera were mentioned by Noble (1929) and Thurow (1968), although histological and functional verifications are needed. The presence of courtship glands is con- sidered a derived trait within the pletho- dontid lineage (Houck and Sever, 1993). Thus, the courtship glands that were de- scribed in the salamandrid Notophthalmus viridescens (Pool and Dent, 1977) are not homologous with plethodontid courtship glands. Unlike the sexually dimorphic species Aneides hardii, both males and females of A. lugubris express a suite of derived char- acteristics, such as hypertrophied jaw mus- 339</page><page sequence="2">340 HERPETOLOGICA [Vol. 53, No. 3 cles, monocuspid teeth, and heavily ossi- fied skulls (Staub, 1989; Wake 1963, 1966). This lack of sexual dimorphism in A. lu- gubris may be further manifest by the presence of modified granular glands in fe- males as well as in males. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined skin from the ventral sur- face of the tail, excised posterior to the clo- aca, by light microscopy from 10 males and 10 females. Specimens [from the Mu- seum of Vertebrate Zoology and from Staub's personal collection (Appendix I)] had been fixed in 10% NB formalin and stored in 70% ethanol. We measured snout-vent length (SVL) from the tip of the snout to the posterior margin of the vent. Inspection of the gonads determined whether the animals were sexually mature. Our sample included animals from the fol- lowing months and years: males-Febru- ary (1978), March (1994), April (1971), August (1973), October (1968), November (1970), December (1968); females-Feb- ruary (1978), March (1994), April (1971), May (1970), September (1968), October (1968), November (1970), December (1968, 1969). We used standard histological proce- dures for embedding and sectioning (Hu- mason, 1967). Samples were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in Americlear (Baxter, Inc.), embedded in Paraplast, sectioned at 12 ,um with a rotary microtome, and mounted on microscope slides. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for general morphology (Humason, 1967) or the Histochemical Quad stain (Floyd, 1990), which involves four reactions to identify proteins (napthol yellow), neutral carbohydrates [periodic-acid Schiff (PAS)], acid mucopolysaccharides (alcian blue, pH 2), and DNA (cresyl violet Schiff). Control slides for the PAS reaction either were not treated with periodic acid or were treated with dimedone to block aldehydes. We examined glands via light micros- copy for shape of epithelial cells, shape of epithelial nuclei, secretion characteristics, and reaction to diagnostic stains. Slides were examined for sexual differences and seasonal variation. We measured (to near- est 0.01 mm) diameters of granular and modified granular glands at the section containing the gland's secretory duct. We measured 1-5 glands of each type per specimen. We compared average gland di- ameter between gland types and between males and females using the t-test (Stat- view 512+, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, California). A t-test was also used to com- pare male and female SVL. RESULTS Two types of secretions are identified in glands with granular secretions. One type is strongly PAS positive and the other is only slightly PAS positive (Fig. 1A,B). Both types are present in males and females. Those glands with a strongly positive PAS reaction, negative reaction to alcian blue, and a slightly positive reaction to napthol yellow we identify as post-cloacal modified granular glands. Granular gland secretions have a slightly positive PAS reaction, a negative reaction with alcian blue, and a positive reaction for napthol yellow. Glands that were PAS positive with full treatment had negative reactions under control conditions. These post-cloacal modified granular glands have two distinct morphologies (Fig. 1) that occur in sexually mature males and females. The first type is com- posed of columnar cells full of granules and with basal nuclei. The gland lumen, if present, is relatively small and is void of secretory granules. In contrast, the second type of modified granular gland is com- posed of cuboidal cells that do not contain granules, have indistinct plasma mem- branes under light microscopy, and have circular or ovular nuclei. Secretory gran- ules are found only in the large gland lu- men. These two morphologies occasionally occur in what appears to be a mixed gland (Fig. 2A). There was no clear pattern of seasonal variation in post-cloacal modified granular gland morphology. Both mor- phologies of modified granular glands were present in most months sampled. The following types of mixed glands were observed: mucous and granular, modified granular and granular, and the</page><page sequence="3">September 1997] HERPETOLOGICA 341 FIG. 1.-Transverse sections through the ventral skin posterior to the cloaca in males and females of A. lugubris.

In females, there was no significant differ- ence between the size of modified granu- lar glands and granular glands (Table 1; t = -0.25, P = 0.80). The size of modified granular glands was significantly different between males and females (t = 3.63, P = 0.003), but granular gland size was not dif- ferent between males and females (t = 0.81, P = 0.44). There was no difference in SVL between males and females (t = -0.45, P = 0.66, male: x = 73.6 mm ? 3.6, female: x = 75.6 mm ? 2.9). DISCUSSION We confirm Noble's (1929) observations that a distinct gland type is present in both males and females of A. lugubris. This is the first documented instance of glands present in females that are morphological- ly and histochemically similar to the typi- cally male courtship glands. Because it is presently not known whether these glands on the undersurface of the tail are in- volved in courtship behavior, we refer to these glands as modified granular glands - I .

There is no significant difference in size between granular and modified granular gland sizes in females (P = 0.80), but in males modified granular glands are significantly larger than granular glands (P = 0.02).

Although males have larger modified granular glands than females, the presence of these glands is not sexually dimorphic. Other non-sexually dimorphic glands have been identified in plethodontids, such as post-cloacal glands (Simons and Felgen- hauer, 1992) and tail base glands (Brizzi et al., 1991). Unlike the modified granular glands in A. lugubris, however, none of these gland types is PAS positive. Thurow (1968) noted that courtship (hedonic) glands were present in both sexes of the eastern large Plethodon species complex, though were not as well developed in fe- males as in males. These glands have not been histologically examined. In Eurycea bislineata, the epithelial cells of dorsal caudal courtship glands ex- press distinct seasonal variation (Sever, 1989). In contrast, our study found no clear pattern of morphological seasonal variation in the modified granular glands of A. lugubris. Relatively low sample sizes may explain this pattern or these glands may not express seasonal variation. The function of the post-cloacal modi- fied granular glands in males and females of A. lugubris is not known. Courtship glands of the submandibular cluster in male plethodontids are often rubbed or slapped on the female during courtship (Arnold, 1977; Houck and Sever, 1993). The dorsal cluster of caudal courtship glands of Eurycea may be used to stimu- late the female during the tail straddling walk of courtship (Sever, 1989). The ven- tral tail surface, however, is not a primary area of contact between males and females during courtship behavior. Furthermore, because most courtship glands are sexually dimorphic, the presence of modified gran- ular glands in both males and females ar- gues against having a typical role in court- ship behavior. Male and female plethodontids are known to communicate via pheromones (Home and Jaeger, 1988; Jaeger and Ger- gits, 1979; Jaeger et al., 1986), and the be- havior of pressing the cloacal and post-clo- acal regions against the substrate is well documented (Jaeger, 1984; Jaeger et al., 1981). Post-cloacal glands, which are en- larged granular glands (PAS negative), have been identified in adults and juve- niles of P. cinereus (Simons, 1992; Simons and Felgenhauer, 1992; Simons et al., 1995). Behavioral studies show that in this species the proximal half of the tail is che- mosensorily investigated by other salaman- ders more frequently than other areas of the body (Jaeger and Gabor, 1993) and that scent-marks from this region affect in- truder-resident interactions (Simons et al., 1994). The post-cloacal modified granular glands may serve a similar communication function in males and females of A. lugub- ris. Mixed granular and mucous glands are considered a distinct developmental type of gland (Delfino et al., 1986). Whether the other combinations of mixed glands observed in this study (granular and mod- ified granular, mucous and modified gran- ular) represent distinct gland types re- quires additional study. The developmen- tal relationship among gland types also needs study. For example, secretions may change histochemically during glandular or organismal ontogeny.</page><page sequence="5">September 1997] HERPETOLOGICA 343 Submandibular and caudal courtship glands may be evolutionarily derived from different gland types (Houck and Sever, 1993). Although these courtship glands have the same staining characteristics, in- dicating a mucoprotein secretion, caudal courtship glands cytologically resemble granular glands while submandibular glands resemble mucous glands (Sever, 1989). Experimental work suggests that submandibular courtship glands develop from mucous glands (Sever, 1976). Caudal courtship glands, in contrast, are thought to be derived from granular or mixed (granular-mucous) glands (Brizzi et al., 1991; Sever, 1989). Thus, what are known as courtship glands (submandibular and caudal glands) include nonhomologous gland types. This is confusing; a shared name (e.g., courtship gland) typically im- plies similarity in structure and evolution- ary history as well as in function. Tradi- tionally gland types have been named ac- cording to secretion (mucous vs. granular). We suggest keeping this distinction clear when naming glands. Thus courtship glands of the submandibular region are modified mucous courtship glands. Caudal courtship glands are modified granular courtship glands. To warrant the adjective "vmodified" it must be possible to distin- guish histochemically the gland from the ancestral gland type. For example, the modified granular glands described in this paper are PAS positive in contrast to typ- ical granular glands, which are PAS nega- tive. Only when the function of the gland (e.g., courtship) has been empirically de- termined is that descriptor added to the gland name. Location terms (e.g., subman- dibular) can be added to identify location. For clarity, the glands referred to as post-cloacal (Simons et al., 1994) would be called post-cloacal granular glands to dis- tinguish them from post-cloacal mucous glands. Clearly, a revision of gland names is necessary once additional data on glan- dular origin, development, and function are gathered.. Acknowledgments.-We thank S.
