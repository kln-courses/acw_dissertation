<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LANGUAGE OF VIRGIL AND HORACE' As in literature poetry precedes prose, so in poetry a special and 'heightened' diction seems to precede everyday language.2 Mr. T. S. Eliot has put it thus: 'Every revolution in poetry is apt to be, and sometimes to announce itself as, a return to common speech.'3 How does this apply to Greek and Latin ? There are objections to considering words in isolation from this point of view, since neutral ones are apt to go now grey, now purple, according to their company; but if we do not do so, we deny ourselves the only considerable method of investigation (unsatisfactory though it is) that is still open to us. Again, we must recognize that most poems are composed largely of ordinary words, though these are often used in a way that is not ordinary. It is a matter of degree. Pindar, and indeed Aeschylus, used a comparatively high proportion of poetical words. But when Euripides revolutionized Greek tragedy by intro- ducing 'homely things such as we use and live among', he also made con- comitant innovations in style which are harder for us to detect. As Aristotle remarked in his Rhetoric, 'A poet can beguile us successfully (K7rre~TaL E) by picking and combining words from the language of daily life. This is what Euripides does, and he was the first to indicate the way.'4 There is a certain hesitancy, or even confusion, in Aristotle's remarks on poetic diction. In the Poetics he insists that it must be clear, but not mean: a style consisting wholly of ordinary words would be the clearest, but it would also be mean. The poet must therefore give it distinction by the introduction of unusual words or forms, without overdoing this. He concedes, however, that in the iambic verse of tragedy, which reproduces natural speech as nearly as may be, the most suitable diction is such as one might find in prose, namely ordinary words, with metaphor and ornament.5 Likewise in the Rhetoric he recommends an unusual diction for poetry, but he immediately subjects this to the over- riding rule of propriety (r' 7Tpdov), saying that language must be convincing (7rlOavov), and sound natural in the mouth of the character concerned.6 In fact Aristotle's general view, that poetic diction should be enriched by rare words, is tempered by his Euripidean feeling that in dramatic or quasi- dramatic verse the diction should be more naturalistic. A further source of confusion lurks in the word avOE;eas, and, I think, in its Latin descendant iunctura, as we shall see.7 When Aristotle used avvrtO7n in the passage quoted just now, he was no doubt thinking merely of the way in which I This paper was delivered to the Joint Conference of Greek and Roman Societies at Cambridge on 9 August 1958. 2 See O.Jespersen, Language (1922), p. 432. 3 The Music of Poetry (1942), P. 16. 4 1404b5 KAE7r7E7a S' E' E'av TY7 EK T713 edLOviaS 8gaAdKTOv EKAEyWjv avvTL7.

This introduction of a colloquial phrase to give poignant reality to a moment of tragedy is comparable with Dido's si quis mihi paruulus aula luderet Aeneas -almost 'some tiny Aeneas'-or Othello's the pity of it, Iago, or Lear's pray you, undo this button. It is hard to see how the line could have been put together in any other way so as to destroy the i;&amp;os, and one cannot help suspecting that two wires of tradi- tional Peripatetic criticism have got crossed here, one concerning the effect of ac'vOEcrs in the sense of the harmonious arrangement of words--cptovwa, concinnitas-and the other concerning the effect of it from the semantic point of view, the telling combination of ordinary words and phrases. But it remains noteworthy that so sensitive a critic should throw out as an obiter dictum, as if it were a commonplace of criticism, that Euripides was a poet in virtue of his handling of words rather than his thought. Cicero, who was praised by Caesar for being the first Latin orator to apply selection to vocabulary,4 recommended that orators choose words as euphonious as possible, but taken from the common stock, not sought out for sound, as by the poets.5 Clearly it was orthodox to assume that poetry employed recherch6 words, as the cantores Euphorionis did. Nevertheless it was recognized, as by Aristotle, that drama at least might effectively employ ordinary language; for, fitting together of words, usually with a view to &amp;ppovia, concinnitas.

But the distinction between dramatic and other forms of poetry in this respect does not seem to have been always kept in view. We have thus the first known phase in European literature of the recurrent interaction between two styles of poetry.z What Euripides had done Wordsworth was to advocate, with his 'selection of the language really spoken by men'. There is a fragment in the second book of Philodemus 7rEpt' rroqtldirwv to the effect that poems charac- terized by recherch6 diction are often worthless, whereas poems made of words that are colloquial and ordinary, but well combined, are often good: E' 18tw7LKr V 7E K a E_ ,TEAWV, U-yKEt1FLEOV E K ICaA, XpTEcrOrdV.3 The point is elabor- ated by Dionysius of Halicarnassus in Chapter III of his De Comrnpositione Verborum: 'Many poets, as well as oratorical and philosophical prose-writers, who have picked out words which are definitely beautiful and appropriate to the subject, but have fitted them together in a random and inartistic way, have reaped no benefit from their pains: whereas others have taken words that are humble and unregarded, and by combining them in a pleasing and uncommon way, have invested their style with great charm.' And again he says in Chapter XII: 'No part of speech that signifies any person or thing will prove so mean or squalid or otherwise offensive as to have no possible fitting place in litera- ture'; and he goes on to point out that Homer had used r' Ev'rEAEcLara r-o6v ovoMcaTwov, as had Herodotus and Demosthenes. This brings us to the Roman poets I wish to discuss; for Philodemus is in- separable from Siro, the mentor of Virgil and the Epicurean poets of the circle that frequented the area of Naples ;4 and Horace, who refers to an epigram of his which has not come down to us,s can hardly have failed to know his prose works also; while Dionysius came to Rome in 30 B.C., just when Virgil was embarking on the Aeneid and Horace on the Odes, and remained there, teach- ing young Romans, at least until 8 B.C., the year of Horace's death.6 There is thus every reason for supposing that the Augustan poets were familiar with what Greek critics had said, and were saying, about poetic diction. Now there is a curious sentence in the part of the Suetonian Life of Virgil which deals with his detractors (ch. 44) : 'M. Vipsanius called Virgil a puppet of Maecenas, inventor of a new kind of affected style, neither inflated nor jejune but composed of ordinary words and therefore unobtrusive'. (M. Vipsanius a Maecenate eum suppositum appellabat nouae cacozeliae reper- torem, nec tumidae nec exilis sed ex communibus uerbis atque ideo latentis.) The manuscript reading Vipsarius is an obvious blunder, and M. Vipsanius I Or. 36: Ennio delector quod non dis- cedit a communi more uerborum. 2 For the modern situation see G. S.

Cacozelia was a tasteless excess of any sort; and atque ideo latentis is a distant reminder of Aristotle's KA7rrE'raL 8' E, in the passage on the same subject from the Rhetoric which I have already cited (i4o04b5).' Beside this dictum we may set a remark of Maecenas himself, quoted by the elder Seneca, though it refers to treatment of ideas rather than to diction, to judge from the illustration attached. He said that Virgil managed to be sublime without being tumid, so that his lines were et magna et tamen sana.2 Suetonius' probable source was a work he mentions two sentences later, the book 'against the detractors of Virgil' by Asconius Pedianus, who flourished under Tiberius. The story can be taken as authentic, for who would have been likely to father on Agrippa a spurious piece of literary criticism? Not that he was indifferent to culture: he seems to have aspired to be sung by Horace,3 and the elder Pliny tells us that he made a speech recommending that works of art should be taken out of the seclusion of private houses and made accessible to the public. But Pliny adds that he was uir rusticitati propior quam deliciis.4 We are not here considering his relations with Maecenas (after all, he may only have been teasing), nor his view of Maecenas' relations with the poets of his circle, but the basis and validity of his criticism of Virgil's style. Arresting though it is, the passage has often been surprisingly neglected. It was the sub- ject of an article by Friedrich Marx in the Rheinisches Museum for 1925, to which I am indebted.5 Marx set out clearly the Greek precedents, but when he came to consider its validity for Virgil he was extremely sceptical about our ability to judge, because of our ignorance of the nuances of Roman speech. The point I want to make is, that he may have been unduly sceptical, in the light of subsequent research. The same year, 1925, saw the publication of W. Baehrens's Skizze der lateinischen Umgangsprache, and in 1936 J. B. Hofinann produced his important Lateinische Umgangsprache. The publication of our most useful tool, the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, will be complete in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile some relevant work has been done on Horace. I have not been able to see Giuseppina Brunori's extensive analysis of his language, dated 1930, and in any case it has been rather severely criticized.6 But in the bimillenary year, I935, J. Smereka contributed an article to the Polish Academy's Commentationes Horatianae which began with useful lists for the Odes of archaisms, colloquialisms, grecisms, neologisms, and barbarisms.7 Finally, B. Axelson included a most interesting chapter (4) on the diction of the Odes in his Unpoetische Wdirter, published in 1945. It has long been recognized that the sermones are largely colloquial, and Horace expressly abjured any claim that they were poetical.8 We shall not be concerned with these. The Odes present a more difficult problem, for they are sui generis; there is no Latin work with which they can be compared. They are mostly far from the colloquial style of Catullus' nugae, and many of them are clearly high poetry in the grand manner; but they vary considerably in this respect, unlike epic, which rarely allowed itself to sink below a certain level.

Cordier, which appeared in 1939- Cordier's work is not impeccable, and must be used with reservations.' Thus he has chosen to take no account in his statistics of re- peated instances; and we must remind ourselves, for example, that the word aequor in the poetic sense of 'sea' occurs a hundred times in the Aeneid.2 How- ever, that is scarcely more significant than if we found that Wordsworth used 'deep' for 'sea' a hundred times in the Prelude; and Cordier's figures do seem to permit of rough generalizations. Let us take his three headings of archaisms, rare words (yAC--r-at), and compounds, and see what emerges about Virgil's practice in the Aeneid. Not only the example of the Homeric poems, but also his devotion to Ennius, might have led Virgil to overload the Aeneid with words (or meanings of words), forms, and constructions that were archaisms in his day, the more so as he was by nature amantissimus uetustatis3 and Augustus was anxious to encourage reverence for the past. Now Cordier finds that, if we take account not only of archaic words, but of words by that time reserved to certain spheres such as religion, words used in an archaic sense and archaic constructions, the Aeneid displays about 250 different examples, or one in every 40 lines.4 It is true that some of these recur; on the other hand, constellations of examples are crowded into a few lines where the context calls for them, there being, for instance, no fewer than 22 in the 20 solemn lines where Aeneas comes to the Styx (6. 317- 36).s All things considered, an average of 2 -52 different archaisms per hundred lines seems too low a percentage to diffuse a markedly archaic flavour through- out. This impression is strengthened by comparison with Cicero's translations from Homer, for which the figure is I per cent.6 Quintilian remarked that too frequent or obtrusive archaisms constituted the most odious of all affectations, and elsewhere praised Virgil for the unique discrimination he showed in this respect.7 Turning to yAw-rat, which comprise poetic, technical, rare, and foreign words, we find an average of 3-65 per ioo lines of the Aeneid. It is true that Lucretius' average is no higher than Virgil's, but that is understandable, since he was largely bent on explaining his subject in language his contemporaries would understand. The percentage in Catullus' Epyllion, however, is as high as 8-32, which suggests what we should here expect, a purposeful search for unusual words in the Alexandrian manner. Even in Cicero's verse the per- centage is 8-o, so that Virgil's 3-65 indicates a marked reaction against the practice of his immediate predecessors.8 For compound words the story is much the same. Leaving aside words like carnifex, which were part of everyday speech, we find that Cicero used 3-60 per Ioo lines in his translations, and as many as 7-88 in his other poems, and Catullus 4-I6 in his Epyllion; whereas the percentage for the Aeneid is only about I -oo. Cordier nowhere mentions Agrippa's remark,'o but it does seem relevant to ' See F. H. Sandbach in C.R. liv (1940), 196-7. 2 p. 151. 3 Quint. 1. 7-. 8. Sp. 29. s pp. 67-68. 6 p. 29.

Jackson Knight, in his suggestive Chapter V, says</page><page sequence="6">x86 L. P. WILKINSON his conclusion, that Virgil was concerned to keep contact between epic vocabu- lary and contemporary speech; that he was in reaction against both the Ennian archaizers and the Neoteric experimenters with yACr-ra.x' He may be right in thinking that Virgil's primary motive was to make sure that his national epic was not esoteric. But that does not exclude the possibility that he was also cultivating for its own sake a style which had had its advocates since the time of Euripides. (Incidentally, it is more likely that Agrippa was thinking of the Aeneid than of the way in which the Georgics ennobled humble things which were conventionally felt to be beneath the dignity of poetry, the process to which Virgil referred as angustis hunc addere rebus honorem.)2 But before investigating Virgil's practice further, let us turn to his friend Horace. There are two crucial, but unfortunately disputed, passages in the Epistle to the Pisones which bear on our subject. The first is 11. 46-49 (accepting Bentley's transposition): in uerbis etiam tenuis cautusque serendis hoc amet hoc spernat promissi carminis auctor. dixeris egregie notum si callida uerbum reddiderit iunctura nouum. This I take to mean: 'In disposing words also the aspiring author of a poem should be subtle and cautious, fancying one word and rejecting another. Your language will have distinction if cunning combination makes a familiar word fresh.'3 It is tiresome that the Roman critical vocabulary was even less clearly defined than ours. lunctura is sometimes used for the collocation of words that produces euphony.4 But here it refers to semantic collocation, as Heinze, Rostagni, and Steidle have seen. For how else could it be said to make a word fresh? (Wickham's translation, 'setting', is as good as any.) It includes meta- phor-making, and a passage in the Rhetorica ad Herennium (4. 42) is apposite. The author quotes a sentence; 'Postquam iste in rem publicam impetum fecit, fragor ciuitatis imprimis'. The last word seems corrupt, but it is clear that he considers thatfragor becomes a metaphor in combination with ciuitatis, and he actually refers to this in the next sentence as nouum uerbum.5 briefly: 'It was partially at least a mixed style out of countless spoken and written idioms of different places and ages. The Romans of the time liked it immediately. Agrippa, who thought it rather a grotesque and dishonest style, was very much in the minority.' Roman Vergil (1944), p. 261. I PP- 314-16. 2 G. 3. 290. Immisch (op. cit., p. 88) con- nects Agrippa's remark with Porphyrion's note on Horace, A.P. 47 (callida iunctura), which gives as an example G. I. 185: Nam licet aliqua uulgaria sint, ait tamen illa cum aliqua compositione splendescere. Verbi gratia 'curculio' sordida uox est, ornatu antecedente uulgaritas eius absconditur hoc modo: 'populatque ingentem farris aceruum curculio'. 3 Rostagni rightly stresses that Horace is here dealing with dKAYO (not avOEclat) dvopa'rwvo; but it seems gratuitous to follow him in deriving serendis from serere 'to sow' rather than serere 'to weave'. The latter was a common metaphor for literary composition, and its use with iunctura here is echoed by series iuncturaque in the same sense in 11. 242-3. 4 Quint. 9. 4. 32 ff. Immisch (op. cit., p. 80) takes it so here. s Of course uerba nouare can mean to create new words as by compounding-expectorare, uersutiloquus-or otherwise, senius desertus, dii genitales, bacarum ubertate incuruescere, Cic. De Or. 3. I54.</page><page sequence="7">THE LANGUAGE OF VIRGIL AND HORACE 187 The other passage in the Epistle to the Pisones is 11. 240-3: ex noto fictum carmen sequar, ut sibi quiuis speret idem, sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem: tantum series iuncturaque pollet, tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris! 'I will aim at a poem created out of the familiar, such that anyone might hope to emulate it, but sweat much and labour in vain if he ventured to emulate it; such is the power of texture and combination, such the dignity that can accrue to words taken from the common stock.' Horace is here speak- ing of propriety (7r rrpe'rov) in relation to the diction of Satyric Drama,I which must differ from Comedy, not employing only inornata et dominantia (KIpLa) nouns and verbs (1. 234), because supernatural characters, for instance, must not talk the language of slaves,2 but on the other hand avoiding exoticism. It was characteristic of this style that it looked deceptively easy, but was in fact very hard to use well. Such was the art of Euripides, as we saw; and as an epigram in the Anthology emphasized: 'Tread not the path of Euripides, singer, nor aspire to it, for it is a hard way for men to go. It looks smooth, but those who set foot on it will find it rougher than a bed of cruel stakes. Try scratching but the surface of the Medea, and you will be doomed to lie below in oblivion. Hands off his garlands.'3 Such also was the plain style of oratory, as Cicero says in the Orator : 'The audience, even though they are not orators, are confident that they can speak like that: for that plainness of style (subtilitas) looks easy, but nothing is less so when you try.'4 We must first consider, however, whether these precepts of Horace are likely to reflect his own practice. The fragment of Philodemus to the same effect which I quoted just now may, as is often the case with him, be a quotation from someone he is castigating; if so, it may be from Neoptolemus of Parium, whom Horace is known to have used for his Epistle to the Pisones, so that Horace may have been guided by his source rather than his experience. Again, we have little reason to suppose that Horace or the Pisones were really writing Satyric Drama, so that the second passage may be particularly academic. And finally, we have in the Epistle to Florus Horace's advice on diction to the man who would create a poem on true artistic principles. He will boldly cut out words that have too little lustre (parum splendoris), revive forgotten words, unearth splendid names that have grown rusty in recent years, admit new ones sanc- tioned by usage, and flow like a strong, pure stream enriching the Latin tongue. He will prune and refine his language.5 There is no suggestion here that there is any virtue in using ordinary words, though the two Epistles must have been written at no great interval of time from one another. Commentators have pointed out a certain similarity between the views given here and those given by Cicero with regard to propria uerba in De Oratore 3,6 and dependence on I I agree with Rostagni that he is still treating of diction. 2 Compare this application of the doc- trine of 7-rd rrprov to j0o0 (Arist. Rhet. 3. 7) with the observation at 11. 95-98 that Euri- pides' Telephus, when poor and in exile, rightly uses sermo pedestris, not tragic grandilo- quence, in his complaints. 3 A.P. 7. 50o, by Archimedes, or Archi- melus (third cent.

P. WILKINSON Cicero or a common source, apparent elsewhere, cannot be ruled out here. Everything warns us to hesitate before we take Horace's critical utterances as relevant to his own practice in the poetry of the Odes. Let us therefore examine this independently. Marx, who dealt with Horace incidentally when discussing Agrippa's dic- tum on Virgil, mentions only one instance of what might exemplify callida iunctura, the application of diuites to insulae (instead of the normal fortunatae) at Epode 16. 42 and Odes 4. 8. 27. But we now have the help of Professor Axelson's study. His most important conclusion is that Horace, while in some respects more fastidious over delectus uerborum than any of his contemporaries,' showed a far stronger tendency to admit rather prosaic words, such as obire, ordinare, praesidium, pecunia, or negotium, than one would expect of a high lyric poet.z An astonishing example is recte, rectius, found four times in the Odes and some thirty times elsewhere in Horace, but never in Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, Virgil, Seneca (tragedies), Lucan, Valerius, or Silius.3 Can we perhaps suppose that these prosaic words were given distinction or freshness by series and iunctura? It is hard for us to judge, for how can we re- capture the sense of novelty that may have excited a Roman ? What did Quin- tilian mean when he said that Horace was uerbis felicissime audax ?4 If the metaphorical use offragor for a political crash or uproar was a nouum uerbum to the author ad Herennium, with what a shock of excitement may Horace's audience have first heard the words auditumque Medis Hesperiae sonitum ruinae! A casual perusal of the Odes reveals at least a hundred examples of what may have been such innovations, for all we know. Most of them fall within recogniz- able categories. Some of the metaphors, such as 'to bridle licence' or 'sunny flowers' have become commonplace to us.5 Some were extensions of already familiar ones, as tepebunt in quo calet iuuentus nunc omnis et mox uirgines tepebunt, and commissi caloresfidibus.6 Some involved witty play on words (paronomasia): thus non erubescendis adurit ignibus means 'she does not fire you with a flame at which you need blush', with a play on the similar effect on the face of literal and metaphorical flame.7 Opacam porticus excipiebat arcton means 'a colonnade caught the northern shade', but it also means 'trapped the Bear'.8 Messalla is fond of wine, though he is steeped in Socratic dialogues; Lydia must bring out ' Unpoetische Wdrter, ch. 4, PP. 98-II13.

Horace often uses anthropomorphic language of natural subjects, animate or inanimate, in a charming way reminiscent of the Georgics. A farm lets its owner down, the trees blaming now the rains, now the parching heat, now the cruel winters.z The plane-tree is unwed, the ashes are bereaved of their leaves, ivy clings wantonly, and oaks have ears to hear Orpheus.3 A wind may be Bacchic, or commit crime; it may be companion of winter or governor of a sea.4 The sea may be too over-mastering; a river may be uxorious, or gnaw its water-meadows.5 A jar can be taught to imbibe smoke, or enticed out by a little box of nard.6 There are, indeed, passages in which there is a sustained treatment of natural phenomena in terms which suggest human experience.7 Personification also plays its part: Love keeps vigil on young cheeks, as in a chorus of Sophocles; Confidence pours out secrets and is more transparent than glass; Care rides pillion behind the horseman.8 Sometimes a subtler thought is involved: like the Stoic wise man who is always king the spirit of Lollius has been consul not for his one year only, but all the time he has been winning his moral victories; on the other hand, a consul's lictors have no power to remove the wretched tumults of the mind and the cares that flit round coffered ceilings; and Death, whether summoned or not, hears the poor man's plea for relief9 (see further M. Andrewes, Greece and Rome, 1950, 106- 15)- Besides metaphor and quasi-metaphor there are bold uses of transferred epithet-adulteros crines, sublimi anhelitu, uices superbae'0-and of oxymoron- splendide mendax, insanientis sapientiae consultus, sollicitum taedium," and all the variations on the theme of yAvKV'tKpos "Epws,IZ2 not to mention unusual con- structions, many of them borrowed from Greek. Enough has been said to substantiate what is indeed a commonplace, that clever use of words in an unfamiliar setting was a characteristic of Horace's Odes. But were these also peculiar in being markedly everyday words ? Axelson could find little ground for thinking them specially prosaic in the instances he considered.'3 Are we then to suppose that in his predilection for prosaic words, Horace was simply insensitive to their associations, or consciously aiming at propriety and adequacy as an ideal of expression, in accordance with his temperamental 'matter-of-factness', his 'formidable realism'"4 (furchtbare Reali- ' Socraticis madet sermonibus (3. 21. 9); munitaeque adhibe uim sapientiae (3. 28. 4); conuerso in pretium deo (3. 16. 8). 2 3.

WILKINSON ta't), as Goethe called it? Axelson quotes, without division into verses, six lines of what he takes to be prosaic diction and everyday word-order from Odes 4. 9: non possidentem multa uocaueris recte beatum; rectius occupat nomen beati, qui deorum muneribus sapienter uti duramque callet pauperiem pati, peiusque leto flagitium timet.' I wonder if we are in a position to judge the effect of that in Roman ears. Here, treated in the same way, is a stanza from Tennyson's In Memoriam, equally commonplace in vocabulary and word-order, which does not, however, strike me at least as unpoetical in its context: 'I sometimes hold it half a sin to put in words the grief I feel; for words, like nature, half reveal and half conceal the soul within.' Smereka found 62 different colloquialisms in the 3,134 lines of the Odes: quite a high proportion. On the other hand, he found 52 archaisms, which would militate against any naturalistic effect.2 Such statistics cannot help us much here, because the Odes vary so greatly in tone; nor could we in any case use them satisfactorily for comparisons with epic poetry, since the length of Horace's lines varies so that it is hard to compare his verse with hexameters. Let us now return to Virgil, and consider his diction in the light of what we have deduced about noua uerba with reference to Horace. In Virgil's case we are fortunate in having some corroborative evidence, in the Saturnalia of Macrobius. Nettleship, in his excursus on Virgil and his Ancient Critics,3 showed that the observations on Virgil's use of language in Macrobius 6. 6, though put into the mouth of Seruius, are independent of the extant Servian Com- mentary; and that both appear to be drawing on a common source; and further, that this source seems to be a defence against hostile and inept critics. We know from Suetonius4 that Asconius Pedianus, who lived under Tiberius, had written a book Contra Obtrectatores Vergilii, his opponents including one Herennius, who had made a collection of Virgil's uitia, and this book may well be the common source. If so, then the usages quoted were selected for blame or praise not long after Virgil's death, and when we are told that they were novelties, we can accept the evidence as contemporary. The Macrobian Seruius is asked to say what instances he has noted in Virgil of figurative usage invented by himself, not borrowed from predecessors, or applied by him in a new but fitting way.5 He obliges with some examples. Recens caede locus, for instance, is noue dictus,6 and infrontem rugis arat the verb is non nimie sed pulchre dictum; and aquae mons, telorum seges, and ferreus imber are applauded.7 Of especial interest, in view of Horace's uerbum reddiderit iunctura nouum, are the paragraphs (17-19) on excogitatio nouorum sensuum. Here we are told that Virgil was the first person to speak of harnessing waters, with his glacie cursusfrenaret aquarum, or to say that a flower smiles, with his mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho ;8 and there are ten other instances, most of which would never have struck us as 1 45-50, iii.

'When English is a dead language', he wrote, 'the novelty will have gone from such a phrase as [Tennyson's] all her dress Wept from her sides as water flowing away. Now that Latin is a dead language, can we recapture the thrill given to its first readers by tota cohors ... relictis ad terram defluxit equis ?' Macrobius also provides evidence of Virgil's use of natural language. He defends by analogy with Homer his lines which are 'as it were plucked and shorn and indistinguishable from colloquial speech',3 instancing omnia uincit Amor: et nos cedamus Amori and nudus in ignota, Palinure, iacebis harena. And a critic named Cornutus, who blamed Virgil for meiosis in calling Busiris merely inlaudatus and saying that Scylla merely uexasse ships, also blamed him for homely diction in the phrase dixerat ille aliquid magnum.4 At Aen. 12. 296 Messapius gives Aulestes his death-blow with the cry which (as we are re- minded by the comic poets) the crowd used to raise when a gladiator was laid low: 'Hoc habet !'-'He's had it!' Of callida iunctura, in the sense I have assumed for it in discussing Horace, Mr. Jackson Knight has drawn attention to many and diverse examples from Virgil, concluding that his art lay in combining his few words so as to elicit a great variety of meanings.5 Let me now sum up. There was a long critical tradition that good poetry could be composed of everyday words. Horace on occasion paid lip-service at least to this tradition. Agrippa thought that Virgil had introduced the idea, apparently unaware that it was as old as Euripides in practice and as Aristotle in criticism. Examination of the vocabulary of Horace's Odes and Virgil's Aeneid has established the fact that both poets do use ordinary words to a marked degree, even if we make allowance for the strong random element that must affect such statistics. To some extent it seems likely that the ordinariness of the words in themselves was offset by bold and clever combinations that imparted freshness and overtones, and by poetical or abnormal constructions; but in many cases there seems to be no question of this. The practice of these two closely associated poets seems therefore to represent a reaction, sufficiently I A. 2. 422, mentitaque tela; 9. 773, fer- rumque armare ueneno; G. 2. 36, cultusqueferos mollire colendo; ib. 51, exuerint siluestrem ani- mum; A. 1. 804, uirgineumque alte bibit acta cruorem (cf.
