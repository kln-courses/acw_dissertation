The number and quality of the Spender portraits bear witness to an extraordinary closeness between the two, and perhaps for the first time in the artist's work, give one the sense of the subject as a collaborator—a sense that is so strong in later paintings and drawings, and on which some of Freud's subjects have remarked. If Spender was entranced by Freud, the drawings make the case that Freud was equally impressed and inspired by Spender's intelligence, kindness, and thoughtful seriousness. As often as not, Spender's gaze is downward, presumably focused on a book; in one drawing he is shown typing, in another, writing by hand.
