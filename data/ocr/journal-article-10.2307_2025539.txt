This is a work of passion and polemic as well as of philosophy. Stephen Clark writes to convince us that much of the treatment of animals by humankind in our time is "foully mistaken" (33), for we are, most of us, supporters of a war against animals whiclh is vile and barbarous (3 and frequently). Most of us eat animals, use prod- ucts made from their bodies and other products whose safety and efficacy has been established by animal experiments. These practices amount, in Clark's view, to murder and torture, since we human beings ... have no extra standing in the world. But the number of those prepared to remember that the land is the mayfly's, and the thrush's and the fox's as much as it is man's, and that as we crash around flooding valleys and destroying woods and meadows we are guilty of theft and murder, is very limited (113). Clark announces from the start that he is a "committed crank and zoophile" (3) and that he seeks to appeal past current orthodoxy to "the hidden, guilty, nebulous convictions of the heart" (4). This appeal is conducted in a number of ways. Clark reminds us re- peatedly of what really happens on the farm, in laboratories, and at the slaughterhouse, and of the ways in which we often misde- scribe and disguise these facts. He dissects numerous arguments advanced by the "orthodox" defenders of various current practices which harm animals. He probes the psychic depths which, he be- lieves, underlie the distancing of humankind from animalkind. And he presents, and to some extent argues for, an alternative vision of the relation of the human to the natural world. 0022-362X/80/7707/0440$00.70 C 1980 The Journal of Philosophy, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 441 Clark's presentation of the facts is telling, imaginative and exten- sively documented; his psychological explorations are suggestive and his polemics of a high standard. The polemics require him to meet his opponents on diverse terrains, and many of his arguments will surely be effective, or at least provocative, for those who are committed to the particular stances and arguments that he queries. In this review, however, I shall discuss these three topics only inci- dentally, in order to concentrate on Clark's own views. These are different from those of many philosophical defenders of animals' rights, and it is therefore of some interest to discern and assess the larger position into which Clark seeks to fit his radical zoophile convictions. This task is surprisingly hard. Clark remarks engagingly that ... with apologies for what must seem the absence of a systematic ex- position, I am an Aristotelian on Mondays and Wednesdays, a Pyr- rhonian sceptic on Tuesdays and Fridays, a Neo-Platonist on Thurs- days and Saturdays and worship at the local Episcopalian church on Sundays (4/5). He is equally explicit about the positions he opposes. These include the Thomist tradition, for regarding animals as things (5), those who think scientific advance can justify experiments that harm animals (6/7), and humanism, which has "helped to lessen man's persecution of his fellow-men, but at the expense of substituting yet more innocent and defenceless victims' (8). This listing of commit- ments and opponents does more to reveal Clark's position than to explain his grounds for thinking animalkind as much objects of moral concern as humankind. Arguments for the unique moral status of humankind have often and traditionally been based on some version of the claim that man alone is a rational creature. Clark both disputes the claim that rationality (or intelligence, or self consciousness) can ground moral status, and queries the uniqueness of human beings in these mat- ters. Recent work with primates and dolphins suggests that human and animal rationality may not be wholly discontinuous, and our ignorance of the inner lives of other animals provides no grounds for begging the question in our own favor. (See 15-18 and much of chapter v). Arguments against the unique moral status of human- kind have, on the contrary, often focused on the sentience that animals and humans share. [Clark dismisses the Cartesian thought that animals might lack mentality as an "irredeemably fatuous be- lief" (37).] But Clark does not wish to embrace the utilitarian ap-</page><page sequence="3">442 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY proach to animal suffering which is taken by many who agree with him that animals are sentient. He believes that animals have rights and perceives that utilitarianism grounds all rights weakly (22); he also realizes that utilitarians might "justify" much animal suffering on the grounds of greater happiness achieved for others, especially other humans. Utilitarians may indeed plausibly commend meat eating, provided farms and slaughterhouses renounce "inhumane" practices, so that only contended cows are eaten by contented hu- mans (29). Utilitarians, since they regard all lives as means to aggre- gate happiness, see animals as means. Their zoophily is incomplete and incidental. Clark takes neither reason nor sentience alone as the basis for moral concern for animals. Rather he holds that animals are our kin whom we cannot decently treat in ways that are currently prac- tised. The claim of kinship is not merely a reference to evolution- ary connections. Kinship is revealed in varied family resemblances and (the possibility of) shared lives. We cannot even be certain that a man-animal community of interests and values is impossible. The shared interests of shepherd and sheep- dog are an obvious example (24). This example is perhaps unfortunate as well as obvious, since what shepherd and sheepdog share in interests is to harass and eventually destroy the lives of sheep. The point is worth a pause. It is surely a difficulty in developing the idea that animals and humans are kin and can form a single community that most good examples that we have of such sharing are in a context of human exploitation of animals, of the sort that no radical zoophile such as Clark would condone. The relationship between farmers and circus trainers and "their" animals is one of caring and exploitation. To find cases without any trace of exploitation we have to go either to the lives of the saints (cf. 24/5) or to the situation of family pets-and some zoophiles would regard even these as degraded and enslaved by humans. However, the lack of convincing examples of man-animal communities is not a decisive problem if Clark can explain why animals (all animals?) are our kin and what sort of behavior to them this requires of us. The peaceable kingdom may be a future possibility. Clark advances some reflections about the extent to which per- sonal ties can cut across the animal-human divide (89/90). He points out "I am fonder of the cat than of most human beings, particularly of those I have never seen." Others are fonder of their cars or houses or bank balances than they are of most humans.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 443 Hence this point alone cannot demonstrate that animals should not be treated as things or possessions. Further, if personal affections were the whole basis of moral status then we would indeed be back with a particularistic, local morality. Our attachments are mainly to home and hearth, friends and family. But Clark claims that this personal hierarchy of friendship and attraction leads to a more ob- jective hierarchy (90). He writes, "To feel affection is to experience the possibility of considering the object in its own right." In so doing we may be led to a more rational hierarchy of values which extends respect to those who are not our personal kin and friends. Clark does not elaborate on this transition, and indeed confesses: ... my strongest temptation is to reckon the rational hierarchy . . . no more than a paranoid fantasy as soon as it takes on a life separate from the heart's affections and the plain evidence of sense (92/3). If indeed we follow this temptation, then the moral claims of those individual animals and humans for whom we care are stronger than those of distant strangers with whom we feel no bond. They are also stronger than those of nearby human kin for whom we do not care, and stronger than those of nearby animals for whom we feel nothing warm. Clark does not explore these implications of ground- ing moral standing on fellow feeling; he believes that human be- ings can become sufficiently embracing in their affections to include all living beings and perhaps even the rocks and landscapes and larger realms of the biosphere. Just as Plato would solve all prob- lems of civil strife by binding all citizens in brotherhood, so Clark hopes that all conflict between living beings and all human ex- ploitation of the natural order can be overcome by seeing all crea- tures as our kin. Moral discussion on this reckoning is concerned not with resolving the moral dilemmas of our present lives, but with the transformation of heart which Clark sees as required for the realization of the peaceable kingdom. Given this view of the need for a transformation of the relation of men to the natural world, it is clear enough why Clark sets him- self as his next task the diagnosis and exploration of the constric- tion of human affections now so widely present. He holds that the very remoteness of urban men from the animal world has led us to conceive that world in illusory terms. We are anthropomorphic and sentimental in our views of animals, but also attribute evil and cruelty where there is none. Shielded by fantasy we see . . . cows as placid and incurious hunks of flesh . . . dogs as loyal slaves ... birds in general as so much stuffed and twittering fowl. We do not see the individuals; we see the types of our imagination (121).</page><page sequence="5">444 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY We are estranged from our kin, because we are gripped by fantasies which are travesties of the nature of most animals. Indeed, accord- ing to Clark, Our attitude to nature is already so unrealistic and irresponsible, so contaminated by fantasy, that no coherent grounds will be available to outlaw attitudes even the orthodox consider vile (128). Given this view, it is not surprising that Clark has little faith in piecemeal reform. Only a conversion of the heart will help break the grip of fantasy. Scientific progress will not help, since no fan- tasies are stronger than those of scientists, whose perverted ideals of "objectivity" blind them to the reality of the tortures they inflict upon animals (chapter vii). Clark does not soften his judgment: "In the name of science, they serve Satan" (153). There is, then, no remedy short of a resumed respect for the nat- ural order (chapter viii), a recognition "that other lives have lives to live" (161). With tenderness and fellow feeling "we may come to see our earth as a cooperative endeavour of many million creatures" (162), and take from it as little as we can (174). But Clark is far from explicit about the way in which the new order might be reached or the sort of accommodations among species that might be involved. Nor does he consider those less than Utopian situations in which the welfare of humans and animals is, for whatever rea- sons, opposed. He correctly points out that some animals' lives could be made much better with little harm to human lives. But such amelioration is the goal also of the less radical "liberal zo- ophiles," for they too would oppose factory farming (and possibly all meat eating), vivisection and cruel or unnecessary experiments. But the radical zoophile goal, which Clark advocates, sees all life as sacred and demands far more of humans. Respecting other lives means not only refraining from killing or torturing, but also re- specting the habitat on which those lives depend. We must at least "stop fouling the wilderness" (169), and, if it comes to a crunch, as it surely must with a human population explosion, "Acceptance of the tides of life and death is better shown in bearing our death than in drowning others" (179). However, it appears that Clark's vision of the place of humans in a world of many species does not see them as responsible for the welfare of other species (which they will likely not perceive cor- rectly) and does not make them into the moral policemen of the animal kingdom, charged with preventing the violence between other species. "Even to deprive the prey of its predator may be a</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 445 mistake" (180).1 It is significant that Clark's favorite example of an appropriate relationship between humans and other animals is that of man and cat. Cats, as he observes, live alongside rather than with humans (126). It is not so much a community of different species as a relationship of mutual respect and noninterference that Clark advocates. Surely there is a hiatus here. The image of animals as kin suggests that humans should be involved in and share the lives of animals, rather than distance themselves from animals. The root of the problem is perhaps that the animal world is not harmonious. As long as lions do not lie down with lambs, humans must share lives either with lions or with lambs-or distance themselves from both. Hence the possibility of being "kin" to other animals turns out, under present rather than utopian conditions, to amount to the rather uncomfortable prospect of being the neutral observer of a family feud. And the neutrality is perhaps illusory. Here, as else- where, we will end up on one side or the other: we will either protect the lambs and starve the lions, or allow the slaughter. Clark's vision of the peaceable kingdom continues a noble and beautiful tradition, and he advocates it eloquently. But if we are not persuaded by the vision and ask for reasons for accepting his view that animals are kin, we find no arguments. He believes that animals have both varied sorts of sentience and intelligence, and that this grounds at least a claim that unnecessary suffering is wrong. But he wants us to accept that animals have far more ex- tensive moral claims. And here he appeals only to the heart. In recent years the writings of moral philosophers have probed the grounds of moral obligation to humans who lack the full range of normal capacities. In debates on abortion and euthanasia and in medical ethics we have seen a growing preoccupation with the moral entitlements of those who are not quite like us-our fellow humans whose sentience or rationality or self-sufficiency is in doubt. These debates scarcely stir the surface of Clark's book. Yet if the appeal on behalf of animals is to convince those whose hearts do not already so incline them, it must, like appeals on behalf of de- pendent human beings, reach beyond assertion to argument. Clark is successful in differentiating his position from the claims of Thomists, Cartesians, and Kantians, who grant animals no moral standing, and base any duties to them on duties to humans, such as the duty to develop a kindly disposition. He is clear about the lim- itations of utilitarian zoophily. But he fails to explicate his own 1 Clark has returned to this point with some reservations in "The Rights of Wild things," Inquiry, xxii, 2 (Summer 1979): 171-188.</page><page sequence="7">446 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY conception of animal-human kinship and the way in which this grounds animals' moral status. The Thomist, Cartesian, and even utilitarian traditions have tried to state the metaphysical grounds that determine who or what may have moral standing. Clark's ap- peal to the claim that animals are kin is not articulated to anything like the same degree. It is because he seeks to do morality without metaphysics that his appeals can reach only the audience who share his commitments to animals. If he were to explain and justify his claims he would have to explicate his conception of kinship and show why it is so extensive. It might then turn out that kinship so explicated does not justify much in the way of moral standing. There are varieties of moral ties among human kin, and problems and conflicts between our kinsfolk in which we cannot be neutral. We can share the goals only of others who also share much. There is no prospect of being kin to all in the human world until con- flicts there are transcended. Such a possibility-a Kingdom of Ends -is one that might be chosen. But since most members of the an- imal kingdom are not able to choose a similar transformation, the harmony of all life forms needed for us to live as kin with all other species is not a possible object of choice. These discrepancies be- tween the human and animal worlds suggest that there may be some connections between moral agency and moral standing and that the case for radical zoophily has yet to be established.
