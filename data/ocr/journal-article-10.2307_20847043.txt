<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM AND MODERN ACCENTUATIONS DETLEV H. KHALID IDENTITY CRISIS AND THE PREVALENCE OF ISLAM A system of beliefs that fulfills a certain function in society tends to become part and parcel of the respective people's self-image. It turns, then, into a means for self-identification and differentiation from others. This again endows it with a sanctity that allows it to resist ten aciously any kind of changes for a considerable time even under heavy pressure. The followers of Islam in different parts of the world?political fragmentation into numerous principalities notwithstanding?used to cherish the notion of belonging to the universal umma, the "indefectible"1 and "charismatic"2 community of the Prophet Muhammad. Their dis tinction from the rest of mankind was symbolized in that they knew them selves as denizens of the dar al-Isl?m, an age-old concept denoting"that frontier of Muslim humanity over against the world still unsubdued with out."3 In this capacity they believed themselves to be united by a bond of revealed standards with ultimate, if not actual, priority over other loyalties. This form of collective self-perception within a religious frame of reference largely persists even today in the national states that sprang up in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, the impact of science and technology on the economic and social organization of this group have compelled it to critically reconsider its inherited system of beliefs with increasing urgency. Gradually, the resistance has been broken, and the transition with its discrepancies bstween ancient and modern concepts and life-styles has manifested itself, more often than not, as a nightmare. The breaches in the ideological bulwark have caused dichotomies in ideas and institutions. The process has been experienced all the more painfully, because it was initiated by the changes enforced through imperialist exploitation.</page><page sequence="2">218 DETLEV H. KHALID The resultant chasm in the mental attitudes of Muslim peoples, almost all of whom have been subjected to colonial rule in one form or the other, is an obvious sequel of the dualism-theories applied by colonialism according to which modernization was to be restricted to the immediately profitable sectors only. The remaining sectors, dispensable from the economic point of view but indispensable for military considerations, were kept at bay by pretending to afford them the inviolability necessary to safeguard their traditions. As no such^conservation in water-tight com partments is feasible, the unprofitable sectors were adversely affected, be cause neither were they really left alone to continue their traditional modes of life nor enabled to benefit from the progress introduced in the profitable areas. In this way colonialism dealt a death blow to many of the old structures or, where those were still intact, it ushered in their disruption.4 The disintegration of pre-colonial community structures led, before long to a state of fluctuation as unmistakable sign of ruptures in the value system. This was the typical symptom of an identity crisis, exacerbated by imperialism's furiously determined and systematic negation of the colonial subject's humanity. The metamorphosis into The Wretched of the Earth and the havoc it played with self-respect and the sense of direc tion inevitably called for self-analysis, forcing the dominated peoples to constantly ask themselves: "In reality, who am I?"5 Such dislocation with concomitant unrest and self-torture can be instanced in many ways. A particularly conflicting example is the modern concept of state to which Muslims, and especially Arab Muslims, had to adjust. Formerly they were wont to think in terms of immediate kinship on the one hand, and universal religious brotherhood on the other. In contrast to these customary relationships, the twentieth century demands loyalty to anonymous institutions.6 Thus sociologically speaking, the main sources of ideology through out the 20th century Muslim East are to be found in social decomposition, the crisis of identity and the search for new cohesiveness in the social and political order within the modern nation state.? Egypt is an example of a country with comparatively early and more thorough penetration of European influence. As it constitutes a kind of radiating pole in the region, an eloquent author has remarked that: "This society was rocked this way and that way by British imperial ism, Egyptian nationalism and Western techniques. It has been rocked</page><page sequence="3">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 219 out of existence, and is now in little pieces."8 Egypt's identity crisis, it seems, has almost acquired some notoriety; not the least, perhaps, on account of the late President Jam?l *Abd al N?sjr's much publicised soul-searching?his candid effort "to discover who we are and what our role is to be... "9. His vision of a role in search of a hero is traceable to European literature consumed by the budding revolutionary,10 which, however, applies to no more than the form of ex pression; the state of mind underlying this vision had been generated by a host of acculturating thinkers over several generations. About those it can broadly be said that they endeavoured to overcome the civilization lag by means of assimilation, though with wide differences of degree.11 There has been over a century of debate about the old and the new, despite the fact that society has experienced rapid inroads of modernity. For Muslim society, in its medieval statism, the multitudinous changes brought about by reforms in all walks of life have been so severe that, as an observer has put it, they have torn the Muslim "corset".12 One important reason for this was that they were not homespun solutions but a development thrust upon them by alien powers. No doubt, the Arabs celebrate what they call a renascence in Arabic literature, the nahda of the late nineteenth century. However, there had been no time for either a Renaissance on the European pattern nor a Reformation to mature. It was an Arab critic who aptly pointed out that "in politics as inreligion, a reformation must be preceded by a Renaissance."13 Certainly, those who consider Sayyid Ahmad Khan in India as a reform?tor** are as much justified as those who speak of Turkey as an "Islamic Reformation."^ However, in the first case, the religious reformer, notwithstanding the mag nificence of his work, can harldy be said to have swayed his compatriots into carrying on his reformation, and in the second case, the reformation lacks that central figure of a reform?tor in the religious sense. In either case, a reformation as a phenomenon of cultural progress comparable to the European experience is not available for orientation, even if there appear to be some superficial similarities of development.16 Thus the first response to the impact of Europe was religious reformism with its pragmatic effort to re-establish the pristine purity of the faith while making allowance for some moderate adaptations from the new. Though this engendered fundamentalism which later developed its dynamic expression in the form of totalitarian movements the purely religious approach was, on the whole, relegated to the sidelines by liberal modernism which held sway through most of thefirst half of the twentieth century.</page><page sequence="4">220 DETLEV H. KHALID The starting point of the Islamic reformists was the erstwhile grandeur of the community?the cultural basis with religion as its chief component?to which they longed to return. The modernist liberals, on the other hand, made the European age of enlightenment their point of depar ture and aspired to own its scientific spirit, philosophical rationalism and political liberalism. These disparate attitudes of different groups and their classification are to be treated later under a separate heading. For the present purpose a tentative dividing line between two major over-all trends of response may be drawn by way of cautious approximation.17 The first of these two is the attempt at the widest possible assimilation with the new, tantamount to virtual rejection of all specifity. Kemalism it frequently cited as the paradigm of this tendency, though one of the most strident expressions given to it was probably the famous pronounce ment by the Khedive Ism?'?l (1863-1879), who boasted that the Egypt of his day had become in reality a part of Europe.18 However, this solution to the crisis can be excluded from the purview of the present disquisition as it is specifically associated with Turkey whereas post-Ism?'?l Egypt did not really adopt such a course. Though here it was not a planned gradualism either yet the outcome of the conflict between the push of the new and the pull of the old was less decisive and was generally more akin to compromise. This second and, over all, more widely spread attitude tends to assert Muslim specifity in one form or the other. It is characterised by the defense mechanism of intermittent resolves to withdraw into the self and bring forth nativistic solutions. Liberal nationalism prevailed in this camp, too, but in contradistinction to the radical Westernizers of the Turkish type, the Arab modernists were often very much disconcerted by the apparent loss of identity which their acculturation incurred. In this they were hardly different from the fundamentalists. Being both desirous of progress and apprehensive of self-obliteration, a majority of intellec tuals saw in nationalism a forceful device to realize their aspirations as well as to assuage their disquietude. It might be said that the difference to the Turkish nationalists lies with the reservations Arab nationalists had, and often still have, in regard to the manner and degree of acceptable Westernization.19 Nationalism as a new and, moreover, imported form of self-under standing was not easily adjustable to the medieval Islamic outlook which had remained universalist despite centuries of political fragmentation. In</page><page sequence="5">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 221 view of the amplitude of doctrines and religious practices, scholars of Islamic history have been baffled time and again by the phenomenon of many disparate groups identifying so consciously with a universal fraternity. Islamic inclusiveness was indeed based on little more than the declared in tention of belonging to the community of believers.20 When fundamen talism resurged as another choice?an alternate response to the colonialist challenge?it afforded this universalism a new lease of life under a re furbished coat-of-mail with a dynamist veneer. Liberal nationalism and fundamentalist Islamism, therefore, tended to collide in not infrequent competitions for loyalty.2 * The various forms of conflict and adjustment have been dealt with in a number of studies on the subject, most of which confirm the continuing relevance of the Islamic factor as such,22 the undiminished "fiert? musulmane"23 pervading all tiers of society with varying intensity. No doubt, some students of the contemporary scene, sometimes echoing fractions of the Middle Eastern intelligentsia, outrightly deny this specifity of the Muslim case. Such critics opine that the religion of Islam is no more a uniting force,24 that it no longer has any concrete social organization.25 Partly, because it turned fatalistic and remained stagnant in its outlook, and partly, because Western education offers superior science and literature, Islamic tenets are said to have become obsolete in the eyes of the new ?lite.26 Allegedly, Islam has lost its hold and left a social vacuum which causes spiritual dissatisfaction.27 More numerous, however, are those who are alarmed by what appears to them to be an ebullient dynamism of newly independent Muslim states. Some analysts find the explanation for this vitality in the fresh vigour of Islam, particularly its universalism which, time and again, recalls memo ries of a Pan-Islamist semi-theocracy.28 Certainly a number of those, who speak of the "inherent vitality in Muslim society," think primarily of such fundamentalist parties as the Muslim Brotherhood.29 Nonetheless, the craving for a uniquely Islamic form of self-expression is recognized as pertaining to most strata of the social fabric.30 A detachment from Islam31 was, and still is, generally abhorred as obliteration of the cultural identity, as "the real threat, the irreparable defeat."32 Attachment to Islam, on the other hand, knows a large scale of degrees and manifests itself in multifarious forms,33 commensurable</page><page sequence="6">222 DETLEV H. KHALID with the manifold Western denigrations of the Muslim self-image.34 Under such strain the "reconquest of identity"35 led to perio dic reversals of liberal modernists to a more fundamentalist bent of thought starting with the ostensible volte-face of Jam?l al-D?n al Afgh?n? in his later career3^ via the much discussed "crisis of orien tation" in the Egypt of the thirties3? and beyond. Though the religious heritage was defended with varying intensity, its continuing actuality for the reflections of the nationalist thinkers was assured. How much it served the ends of the national bourgeoisie was borne out by the events of ideological development. Egypt's President Anwar al-S?d?t exemplified it when he resumed his predecessor's search for identity with the question, "where do we Muslims stand today?"38 The concern of the present dis quisition is the intellectual orientation predominating during the first half of the century. At the end of this period, Sadat was still demanding that Muslims apply their minds in order to find out what message Islam has for the domain of science and nature, spirit and society. This illustra tes authoritatively the specificity of the Arab case within the fold of Third World nations beset with a crisis of identity.3* The craving to be fully independent and not to mould oneself in the image of others seems to ensure the survival of some kind of Islamic sentiment even with some, if not many Arab nationalists of Marxist leanings.40 HISTORICAL SYNTHESIS AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF MODERNITY In order to preserve or to reestablish this Muslim identity, recourse was taken to the ideal of a synthesis wherein some of the old could be retained while adopting some of the new. The mass of modern data, ideas, objects and methods proffered by the Occident is irretrievably being assi milated, with differences in the degree of rapidity and thoroughness. Conversely, it is evident that the newly absorbed Western knowledge is merging with elements from the past. Before exploring the intricacies of this procedure, something has to be said about the synthesizing activity as a marked quality of the Muslim culture. Many scholars of Islam, both Eastern and Western, fondly recall earlier crises of Muslim history that were overcome by Islam's "amazing cross-cultural absorptive ness,"41 by its peculiar capacity to fuse heterogeneous elements into new creations without loosing its Islamicity. In the course of centuries, it is said, Islam succeeded at "digesting" extraneous influences until they were</page><page sequence="7">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 223 no longer recognizable as such. These ingredients invigorated the old Arab foundation and caused the growth of a splendid culture upheld by an unparalleled divine vision.42 Guided by his study of history, Gibb has come to epitomize Islam as "acceptance of opposed ideas and mediation between them, either in the form of a synthesis, or in assigning separate spheres to each and tolerating their co-existence."43 Whereas Gibb speaks of a characteristic feature of the Arabs, Becker regards this syncretism as typical of the Persians.44 No wonder, then, that others hold it to be the unmistakable quality of Muslimhood as a whole. Al-Ghaz?l?, in his capacity as one of the most out-standing theologians of Muslim history serves as an instance. He is said to illustrate an essential trait of Muslim individuality, viz., the almost unlimited ability to amalgamate contradictions into a harmonious whole, preconditioned by brilliant discrepancies in the doctrine as well as in the nature of the Prophet.4^ Whereas these scholarly opinions are partly a stocktaking of an ideal propounded in Muslim writings, modernist tendencies largely crystal lized as a result of orientalist research on the period termed "classical" Islam.46 It enabled Muslim authors to give an historical endorsement to the ideal of synthesis by making appeals to Islam's record of successful blending that engendered a harmonious culture sui generis. The "classical" example of this synthesizing process is provided by the incipient phase of the Muslim culture especially between 800 and 900, culminating in the creativity of the early 'Abb?sid reign when traditions, doctrines, and institutions were adopted almost naively until an awareness began to dawn that continuous cultural borrowing might endanger the individuality of Islam. Much of the ancient wisdom from the various races constituting the empire had by then been assimilated to the teachings of the Prophet. It acquired a legal status in the canon law by being integrated with the Had?th, his recorded sayings. The independent character of his message was later safeguarded by a process of selecting as truly Islamic those ele ments that were felt to correspond with the image of the Prophet. In the course of this process much of the assimilated matter was divested of its marks of heterogeneous origin.47 This ancient method of acculturation was now recommended by several writers, Muslim and non-Muslim alike,48 as an inspiring example. In order to overcome the present generation's anxiety, they evoke the forebears "r?ussites d'?quilibre".49 That this idea of striking a balance had really become pivotal in Muslim thought is evi</page><page sequence="8">224 DETLEV H. KHALID dent from the fact that in South Asian Islam it was almost institutionalized under the designation of tatbiq, which in Indianized Arabic stands for synthesis.50 With an important school of Muslim thinkers from the sub continent, tafbfq was as imperious a concept as was, for others, the contro versial institution of taqlld (sticking to the judgments of the early fathers). Part of their aspiration was to replace taqlld with tafbiq.51 Even if this characteristic of Pakistani Islam, with its proximity to Indian syncretism, were regarded as too peripheral a phenomenon, there remains Iran where the synthesizing tradition survived in the religious schools right into the 19th century, and probably more than anywhere in Sunni Islam. Significantly, it is this tradition of reconciling science, religion, and even mysticism whence came the initiator of Muslim resur gence in the 19th century, Jamal al-D?n al-Afgh?n?.52 There is, however, an important reservation to be made: during the "Middle Ages" of Islam, which lasted till about the 19th century, the principle of cultural synthesis was generally valid for the past only. In a major part of the Muslim world it was glorified in the ancestral achieve ments alone, and even there it was not always recognized. Where Sunn? islam acknowledged it as such, it was mostly regarded as an ideal that held good for the early community only. The medieval generations, on the whole, did not deem themselves competent for cultural synthesis so that it was no longer a vital principle and failed to stimulate further creativity. In either case "classical" or "medieval", the Muslim synthesizing process was not a planned or systematic enterprise. With the concept of ijm?\ consensus of the believers, it had become somewhat institutionalized, however, not in a clearly definable sense. The scholars of religious law and theology as representatives of the community, did not reach such a consensus as an organized body, because Islamic theory made no elaborate provision for a clerical apparatus. The idea of manifesting the principle of ijm?6 in the form of modern parliaments may not necessarily be a distortion of Islam, as some critics tend to believe, but it certainly is an adaptation to the 20th century.5 3 Ijm?' in history was more like a struggle for the survival of the fittest elements of thought, and the result, an armistice rather than a truce. The "consensus" was arrived at after a free-for-all among the warring groups of theologians. It is, perhaps, best illustrated by the instance of Ash'arism, a compromise school of theology which assumed dominance in Sunn? Islam after other rival schools</page><page sequence="9">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 225 had become too exhausted by a gory feud that lasted, with changing for tunes, for several centuries.54 Although Islam knows no church in the Christian sense, in former times the state exercised some such functions. Caliphs, and later Sultans, often decided the battle in favour of one or the other school. Generally this would occur after a protracted dispute had already taken place so that state authorities could conveniently intervene on the side of the faction that had turned out to be the most popular. For this reason some Islamicists are inclined to take a much milder view of ijmff and even regard it as something like a voxpopuli, a consensus of the entire community rather than of the canonical doctors only. It is a moot point, too, whether this evolutionary process, with its endless ups and downs and long intervals of paralyzing suspension, was a blessing or a bane in the history of Islam.55 It has attractively been projected as "the slowly accumulating pressure of opinion over a long time, "56 the building up of a general will "by gradual stages over a period of many generations."5 7 The question, however, is whether such a drawn out process of selection and rejection by fighting it out can provide a clear-cut perspective for modern emulation. The result would lie far ahead in a distant future and should necessarily be just another standstill compromise, "ascertained only in a vague and general way."58 Apart from theory, Islam, even as a social phenomenon with its amorphous clerical apparatus,59 does not possess a central organization to absorb changes of orientation and give direction to the procedure of adaptation with an effectiveness comparable to that of the Catholic Church. In the 20th century, moreover, it is even divested of the semi-Papal autho rity which the Caliphacy used to exercise.60 A cultural synthesis in the Muslim realm of today therefore, is devoid of the protective shield which the "classical" circumstances used to provide. An additional complication is the stark fact that theological and philosophical questions can no longer be discussed within the Islamic framework alone as was the privilege of the medieval thinkers. For those, as for European leaders of thought during the Reformation and the En lightenment, there was no reference to ulterior standards, they merely had to make their intellect prevail against established norms.The foreign culture that had seduced Muslim thinkers under the 'Abb?sids belonged either to</page><page sequence="10">226 DETLEV H. KHALID the past or to a peoplewhose political glory had come to an end. Muslims in the nineteenth and twentieth century were in no such enviable position they were faced with the more difficult task of asserting their consciences in the tension between two disparate traditions: their own, being the weaker one, and the technical advancement of foreign powers, fixing the ulterior standards. Doctrinal issues, therefore, can no longer be considered on their own merits. It has become necessary to demonstrate that one's own in tellectual and social principles are as progressive as those of the West, and that they are also more truly Islamic than those upheld by the conservatives at home. Some Islamicists speak, therefore, of a double standard and hold it responsible or the replacement of rigorous systematic thought by super ficial slogans and angry polemics.61 Others speak of the Janus-faced character of Muslim reconstruction. On the one hand, they say, it stands in dire need of alien inspiration in order to recover its former creativity, therefore, it has to break the impermeability of its own society to the new; on the other hand, it also has to preserve the stimulating prestige of the past.62 Indubitably, this enforced balancing between the imposing standards of the colonial master and one's own norms, that were tradition ally held to be superior to anything else, bears some of the responsibility for modernism's becoming double-edged and the resultant lack of intellec tual efficacy. Pressurized by the speed of involuntary change, the more capable minds found little chance to apply sustained thinking to the Gor dian Knot. Thus, the advantage of an essentially reconciling approach, moulded by historic experience, doubtlessly exists, yet it remains to be seen how far this can facilitate the task of the 20th century. Granted that the desire for reform with its "noble concern for perfection" through the ransacking of history is the constant aspiration of Islam as that it has been described,63 it still does not answer the question in what way the ancient precedent of acculturation can serve as a model.64 This is not a matter of doubting the power of assimilation which has amply been attested even for Medieval Islam. The real problem seems to be that of cultural creativeness, which was lost in spite of the assimilative capacity and the "vitality" which Gibb dis cerned even in the eighteenth century.65 The demands on such a synthesis are numerous and they are raised ever anew in many different wordings. Thus it has been postulated that</page><page sequence="11">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 227 the synthesis must result from a new evaluation of modern social life and legal institutions in the light of a new formulation of the fundamental principles of Islam.66 So many warnings have been sounded that it should be a genuine synthesis, not congeries or mere syncretism, that one should guard against mistaking symbiosis for synthesis, etc.67 It would have to do justice to the modifications of the Muslim self-view caused by national istic, socialistic and other experiences the community has been through. It has to take into account the detours made for the rejuvenation of the body politic, and it has to demonstrate cogently how the changes are to be justified by the message of the Prophet, if this message is to be heeded.68 All these stipulations, however, are restricted to the acceptance of the principle. The question, as to exactly what elements of the past should be preserved and precisely what contribution of the modern age should be accepted, is answered very differently. In sorting out what is concerned to be suitable there is no binding principle.69 In the absence of a mecha nism to arrive at a consensus, individual selectivity has so far prevented matters from settling down. The multifarious expectations from, and the demands on, such an historically inspired synthesis, under the pressure of rapid transition from abroad and the tension created by new and, mostly, haphazard accentuations, have created an acute vacillation. The resulting frequent shifts of loyalty keep ideological development in the doldrums and produce that symptomatic crisis of the intellectuals on which so much is being written.70 THEOLOGICAL INADEQUACY AND THE REDUCTION OF ISLAM Perceptive observers have stressed the need to calm apprehensions caused by modernity which trouble the minds and hearts of the faithful, and the anguish originating from the doubt that by Westernizing they might incur divine wrath.71 This "bewildered agony of conscious doub ting" entailed a state of deep and tense suspension.7 2 There existed, side by side, a hope that by availing of the new, one might become compatible in the world of future progress, and a fear that the acceptance of the new might deprive one of future spiritual bliss. Thus, Westernization held a pro mise for the future while at the same time threatening it. Appeal was thence made to the past. But whereas modernity left in reality little choice and, by and by, imposed itself in its totality, the multi-faceted heritage forced the believers to reconsider elements of the past which would prove useful in</page><page sequence="12">228 DETLEV H. KHALID the advancement and enhancement of future prospects. The question of what to retain was a vexing matter of decision, leading to an uncertainty about their own position. In this conflict between the urge for emancipation and the anxiety over a possible loss of the spiritual basis of selfhood, the fear of being uprooted, Muslims received but little guidance from their theologians. It is a rather frequent observation made by students of the contemporary scene that the custodians of the faith have been the most unresponsive to the challenges of Westernization. Those from whom answers to the burning questions would be expected, more than from anyone else, did not provide them. They may not have been less perturbed by the changing world around them, but perhaps they were less conscious of it or else, would not admit being so. Their reaction was in any way less agile than that of mass of laymen and especially that of the Western educated class. Al-Azhar, the centre of religious learning in Cairo at first sight does not appear to betray much bewilderment. This ancient university of Islam, from where most preachers and religious office-holders in Egypt and many other countries graduate, is sometimes likened to the Vatican. It is, however, surely not incorrect to say that Rome's formalism is "nothing like the apathy of Al-Azhar."73 A development comparable to the Second Vatican Council is hardly foreseeable in Cairo. In the serenity of their "arrested state"74 the Azharites fail to inspire with fresh energies, and their system of certainties is discreetly discarded by the faithful as inadequate. Those few among the '?lam?', who ventured onto untreaded ground were quickly expelled from the phratry and, therefore, did not act as spokesmen with the authority of Al-Azhar.75 In the writings of the Azharites there is, to use a somewhat poignant formulation, "not the slightest sign or inkling of a restatement of the faith."76 It is sometimes argued that the root cause of this "religious steril ity"77 is the transformation of early Islam from a promise of salvation in the hereafter to an enterprise of reshaping this world. The this-worldly endeavour gave birth to a particular form of Islam which emerged in the wake of the Medinese period in the Prophet's career.78 Ever since, Islam has come to be identified by many with this specific mould, and particularly in the West this is the best-known manifestation of Muhammad's message. Historians may reason that in certain periods this was not the predominant form of Islam, and Muslim modernists may reject all the post-Muhammad</page><page sequence="13">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 229 developments and wish to restart where he ended.79 Nonetheless, Medina, Damascus, and Baghdad entailed a narrow and rigid legalism which, even if it does not outrightly militate against spiritual values, certainly tends to minimize and restrict them. Jomier surely does not go amiss in likening it to Rabbinical Judaism, to which it owes its casuistry.80 The present "low ebb" of Islamic studies, apologetics, and the exegesis of the Qur'?n can, 81 therefore, be attributed to the particular historical development of the Sharl'a, at least partly. As this sacred law was derived by the pious forebears from the Qur'?n and the Hadlth, it gradually came to be conceived as a revealed law. As such it was to be protected against alterations through human legislation. The present on slaught has to be seen against the background of the age of Muslim enlightenment in the eighth and ninth century. It is doubtful whether the conservatives militated against the rationalists because, as someone reaso ned, they misunderstood the ulterior motives of the movement.82 The * UlamS feared rationalism as a force of disintegration and a threat to the social polity in which they were rising. Since they were the guardians and chief benefitters from a legist interpretation, they jealously shielded the Sha rVa from major innovations.83 The emergence of their class and its victory over contenders for influence is an issue the discussion of which would be too ambitious in the present context. Muslim apologists are wont to refer to the sack of Baghdad as a paramount factor leading to stagnation under the aegis of the 'Ulam?\*4 Superficial as this argument may appear, it is partly confirmed by similar development after the repeated sacking of Mus lim Delhi and its final fall in 1857. While these events do obviously not suffice as causal explanation, they do very well symbolize the waning for tune of Islam as a political power and its consequences on the ideological plain. In this situation, the 'Ulama" not only understood to preserve their privileges but even consolidated them,85 ostensibly by elaborating the bind ing force of the Shari'a. Besides, Xhc'Ulamff were, by their very profession, no academic historians,, but teachers of religion devoted to the ordering of society in their own age. Their sole concern was the structure of the community and this formalist consensus of theirs contributed to the stability of Muslim society over the centuries.86 The persistence of formalism is, therefore, closely linked to the political doldrums in which large parts of the Third World continue to find themselves; it is also proportionate to the hapless dependence on the</page><page sequence="14">230 DETLEV H. KHALID manufactured goods and knowledge of Europe. The Muslims who formed the subject of the Turkish ideologist Ziya G?kalp's essays (1875-1924), were not yet "contemporaneous" with the dominant civilization of the day. As long as this psychologically harmful state of things persists, the "zealots offiqhism" will prosper and maintain the same old rigidity.8? Since the conservatives identify Islam per se solely with the canon law, they look at every attempt to abandon it or to accentuate any other feature of Islam as a threat to Muslim identity. The Egyptian SaLfiya movement of Islamic revival, at least in its later edition by the Shaykh Rash?d Ri?l?, bore the stamp of this limitation and became largely res ponsible for the irresponsiveness to new challenges.88 Even after Rid?'s demise in 1935, his followers, not unlike the even more conservative bulk of Azharites, still resemble the Ottoman 4Ulama' before the Turkish Revolution. As a result, one finds that "the main issue of theological discussions in Egypt" during the first half of the century and even after, has been the dispute over the Had?th, their authenticity and importance as a source of legislation.89 After a millennium of SharVa tradition, the conservatives persist in their demand that the canon law be restored. They pay little heed to the gradual acceptance among the liberals of Western researches. Some of the latter have come to admit that the SharVa is 'little more than a crystallization of the mores of a particular period."90 Once the restrictive legalism has come to be regarded as a fetter, doubts about the religious contribution to the expected reconstruction lead to the question whether such a renascence would spring from a revival within the framework of the sacred law, or whether it has to be a breakaway from it.91 The tension between the element of rigidity represented by the hallowed norms and the element of flexibility has been called the fundamen tal ideological issue for Islam in the twentieth century.92 Summing up, it may be said that as a result of their preoccupation with the canon law, considered to be revealed, most theologians continue to stick to their legist grooves of interpretation. Of all sections, they are the most handicapped in responding creatively to the challenges of the modern age and to undertake the prise de conscience that is indis pensable to the process of acculturation. As a consequence of its historical development, Islam became institutionalized as a multi-dimensional phenomenon. In addition to its primordial role as a faith in the Hereafter, it came to be regarded as a</page><page sequence="15">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 231 state deriving its authority from religious precepts, as a moral teaching, as a philosophy, and many th,ings more. Most of these manifestations were, nevertheless combined into a framework with an almost monolithic appearance. Therein one or the other aspect would predominate. As men tioned above, its dimension as a law code held sway for much of the time. In the later phase of the Muslim' 'Middle Ages", however, some degree of balancewas attained. When westernization led to a number of "com pensations, substitutions, intensifications,"93 in short, redefinitions, it resulted in what has been termed "the drift from integral Islam."94 As is the case with most historical religions, the specific manifestations of Islam include moments which, with a difference in accent and stress, would give rise to a pattern of religiosity that "might appear as a deviation from the original pathos and, in extreme forms, as a betrayal and complete negation of its first intentions."9* In this sense, religion has been compared to art, because both diversify on a similar pattern in the course of history. In former centuries this multiplicity of moments, with all its variety of psychological motivations and resultant difference of dogmatic formula tions, eventuated in sectarian ramifications. In a world divided on the basis of "ideologies", the deliberations about the requirements or compo nents of an Islamic identity seldom assume this form, they now result "in a whirl of redefinitions, frequently inconsistent one with the other and only rarely capable of winning ecumenical acceptance."9 6 In this tussle of redefinitions, characterized by the search for distinctive elements to corroborate fresh accentuations, the failing of the religious leadership to rethink the most sacred beliefs and traditions eventuated in the reducing of Islam to one or the other of the following functions that need not be entirely exclusive but, all the same, mostly seem to constitute distinguishable tendencies: 1. a mere facade of cherished symbols ; 2. a socio-political system; 3. a mystic Interiorisation of the faith; 4. a moral philosophy akin to the broad stream of humanistic ten dencies in other communities. A special interrelatedness between (1) and (2) as well as between (3) and (4) is unmistakable. Regarding the first mentioned two aspects it is but small wonder that in view of the "unhappy" and far-reaching "abey</page><page sequence="16">232 DETLEV H. KHALID ance in radical theological thinking in Arab Islam,97" many writings aiming at the restatement of the Muslim heritage are characterized by what is sometimes called detheologization. The phenomenon is not altogether new. In earlier times, detheologization was a feature of the theological rationalism taught by the school of thought called Mu'tazila.98 But violent reaction of fundamentalist anthropomorphism, this does not seem to be relevant in the 20th century. This, again, appears to be an instance whereas they provoked the proving a point mentioned earlier, namely, that formerly intellectual selfrealization was found in the solution of problems differing from the questions raised today. DETHEOLOGIZATION AND THE PRIMACY OF POLITICS The fact that so little of fresh thought was proffered by trained theologians forced other disciples to fill the gap, and they necessarily detheologized Muslim thought still further.99 The vast majority of con temporary lay authors scarcely ever found themselves in a position to apply the newly acquired scientific methodology to religion. The young intelligent sia, the writers and artists of the liberal generation, were confronted with the task of furnishing a rationale for the introduced reforms. Trying to bridge the hiatus between past and present, they availed themselves of religious symbols without, however, attempting a critique of the texts. Dabbling in the history of Islam they alluded to religious notions in sup port of their philosophical argumentation while eschewing theology proper.100 The responsibility for this desistance seems to devolve, apart from their often-one-sided westernized formation, primarily on the psy chosis engendered by the politics of the time. One of the most prolific among European scholars of Islam has made much of the supposed trauma caused to Indians by alleged Chinese confrontation. He concludes that contemporary Islam has suffered no such drastic external challenge.101 This observation is, of course, debatable; it does not seem factual. More significant, however, is that it misses the point by not taking account of the Muslim self-view. The learned critic's matchless empathy with the religious sentiments of Muslimhood is well documented. Yet, in this particular instance, he evinces something of an outsider approach that does little justice to the copious literary output revealing a prepossession with the unmitigated menace of domination by the former colonial powers. This alertness, which had gained momentum during the period of direct</page><page sequence="17">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 233 colonial rule, has, if anything, increased ever since. "Colonialism," Anwar al-S?d?t warns, "continues to fight us by undermining our faith and throw ing doubts into our hearts. Living in a world where the principles of com munism and capitalism clash, Muslims have to take up a position." The solution he proffers bears a political stamp: let us resume the revolution started by our Prophet fourteen hundred years ago!102 It is, inter alia, in this trauma that one has to search the reasons for the neg lect of internal problems and the abeyance in which theological reconstruction is held, eventuating in the preoccupation with Islam as a means of asserting national identity rather than spiritual sublimity and intellectual vigour.103 It has also been argued that in the case of Muslims the suspension of religious thought, resulting from the priority given to the restoration of political force, has a rationale inasmuch as affinity with rule used to be a chief characteristic of Islam in history, so that the colonial interlude symptomized an insidious aberration even religiously.104 In a sense, Atat?rk may have been the most consequential recoverer of that destiny, but as a restitution of Islamic patterns, this was most stridently effected by another secularist, the political founder of Pakistan, Jinn?h. This Western-educated leader proved a puzzle to non-Muslims by establishing a modern state1?5 in the name of Islam. And yet, there is scarcely anything to wonder about in the thoroughly unorthodox conduct of this statesman, whose sole identification was with Islam. In fact, he epitomized the psyche of modern Muslimhood laid bare, its desire to maintain Islamic specifity based on the concern for power and other considerations.106 Clearer than any of his people's leaders, Jinn?h had the awareness of putting the right accent in an Islam that had, numbly and without giving itself account of it, taken to accentuate political resurgence. The "critical shift from the traditional faith to the modern ideology"10? embedded in that "baffling equation of Islam and state"108 which for many has become the new hallmark of their religion and which now they believe to be its most pristine expression.109 The glory which Muslims remembered so well, because it had been so overwhelmingly resplendent, was not associated with a community of race or languge, even territory-wise it was not so clearly limitable; it used to go by the name of Islam.110 After the termination of the Moghul and</page><page sequence="18">234 DETLEV H. KHAL?D Ottoman Empires and the abolition of the Caliphate there was a "real, if indefinable, feeling of loss."111 When Jinn?b relieved their sense of hurt by chiselling out for them a state of their own "as an instrument of the Islamic sense of identity,"112 everything else became insubstantial and he did not even have to play the role of the prodigal son returned from London.113 With the analytical power of the brilliant and well-trained barrister that he was, Jinn?h merely anticipated what an Arab intellectual would later formulate as the result of his scholarly research, namely, that although Islam as metaphysics scarcely exercises a genuine hold on the mind of the youth, it does supply a point of national cohesion.1 J4 Thus, even in the Arab world where, unlike Pakistan, the self is not so exclusively referred to as Muslim, Islam prevails in one form or the other as an abiding element of self-reconstruction. As an apostle of Arab nationalism has pointed out, when the Arab masses assert their attach ment to Islam, especially in matters of politics and culture, the under lying motive is mostly their refusal to be reckoned vassals of the former colonial master. Adherence to Islam reassures them in their self-com prehension as part of an historical and geographical entity with a proud legacy of values and cultural roots.115 The ideological disputes between Islamist and nationalist intellect uals are scarcely representative of mass sentiment. These groups do, no doubt, influence the common people. Yet, no standpoint seems to score a decisive victory in the consciousness of the masses who invariably seem to coordinate these trends without always becoming aware of the potential clash of loyalties. The assessment of this popular commitment to Islam in its relationship to nationalism varies. It has been described as "quite negative, little more than a sense of difference which stiffened in the foreigner's presence."116 It has also been referred to as "the profound Islamic reserves of the masses that would gush forth in the struggle for liberation."117 Recent surveys in Egypt show that "a nebulous attach ment to Islam" goes side by side with secular nationalism.118 This intertwinement of Muslimhood and nationalism has aptly been elucidated by Jomier. Proceeding from the absence of racialism in Islam he writes that the differentiation made between members of the religious community and non-members manifests itself at times as a kindred phe nomenon. A superiority feeling surfaces with the masses as a kind of</page><page sequence="19">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 235 "collective instinct" expressing itself as a depreciating group reflex toward those who are not brethren in faith.119 This trend owes much to Afghani's reinvigoration of Islam as a counterweight to what he and his contemporaries experienced as a European undermining of Muslim identity. He was alarmed particularly by the Brit ish conviction of their superiority and their efforts to instil a sense of inferiority in their colonial subjects by denigrating the proud legacy of Muslim civilization. Precisely because he was so fully conscious of the necessity to learn from the haughty West, Afghani hatched out a device to prevent admiration for and identification with the imperialist ruler. In need of an ideology to politically unite Muslims against European encroach ments, he reshaped Islam and ideologized it.120 Instead of the medieval quietisi belief in the hereafter it became through him the mainspring of anti-imperialist solidarity.121 Even his treatise, The Refutation of the Materialists, theological though its contents appear at first sight, is not what the student of religion would classify as "rethink ing",122 it aimed primarily ad majorem gloriam Islamismi.12* This analysis may be somewhat pointed insofar as the transformation could not be more than partial and contradictory. Nonetheless, there was a palpable accentuation of far-reaching consequences. The 20th century intensification of this assertion of Islam as a detheologized cultural dist inction has been explained as the result of the progress made by Westerniza tion. Thus, apart from the persisting trauma of colonialist menace, a certain saturation with Western culture is said to intensify the psychological need to prove that all that has been attained is the result of one's own in tellectual capital and not the product of a foreign oppressor's benevo lence.124 As, therefore, the new demand for Islam was raised in response to the challenges of the 19th/20th century, it was neither anymore identical with the religious needs of old nor was it any longer the major organizing principle of state administration. As an identification of government it was pushed aside by modern state reform and, thereafter, acquired a new bearing. It was now, first and foremost, an expression of the desire to sustain cultural identity in the confrontation with the overwhelming foreigner.125 Thus reduced to a cultural underpinning of political com munity, Islam well-nigh experienced an eclipse of the religious, if not the intellectual.126 That this development is part of a larger phenomenon</page><page sequence="20">236 DETLEV H. KHALID common to the Third World can be instanced, without detracting from the specifity of the Muslim case, by Kwame Nkrumah's reinterpretation of the Lord's Prayer: "Seek ye first the political kingdom and all other things shall be added unto you."127 With some, notably the Islamists, this politicalization of the faith does not stop at the facade of Islamic symbols. Though western thought is frequently stigmatized as a corrupting evil, especially by these circles, they nevertheless succumb to it by presenting Islam primarily as a social programme more comprehensive and efficient than any other enterprise seeking to ameliorate this world. The common trend of reducing the Prophet's message to its temporal aspects undermines, an Arab critic warns, belief in God as the sovereign ruler of the universe which was hitherto regarded as the very raison d'etre of the Islamic religion. He hardly over states when he speaks of "a race between modern Muslim writers and Com munists, aimed at showing which system offers more of the fruits of this temporal world... "128 In response to the Western challenge, a broad stream of Muslim writings bespeaks almost an obsession with ni?am, i.e. the establishment of systems. Strikingly enough, this craving for a "complete-code-of life"192 is almost strongest with the Islamists, who profess to reject wes ternization in favour of nativistic solutions, but constantly betray their indebtedness by overemphasizing concepts such as "Islamic system of economics," "Islamic system of government," etc.130 The fact that, as a result of this detheologization, contemporary Muslims of various shades of opinion seem to have a greater faith in Islam as some kind of system, than in God as the Creator, has cogently been elaborated as a chief characteristic of Islam in modern history.131 Islamists, such as the Muslim Brethren of Egypt, present Islam not only as an economic, political, and social system, they project it as an all-embracing world view and a way of life. They claim that it caters for their spiritual needs, but what they derive from it, in the first place, seems to be "their originality, their distinctiveness from the others, from Westernizers, conservatives and revolutionaries alike. Thus Islam for them became a means of self-identi fication."132 This explains why Islam is so rarely given a positive definition. Efforts centre mainly on projecting it as different each time a comparison is made. Thus Liy?qat 'Ali Khan, a former Prime Minister of Pakistan, clarified that "democracy in the Islamic sense" was distinguished from</page><page sequence="21">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 237 both the democracy of the West and the democracy of the Soviet Union: "it was in fact more democratic than both."133 The principles of Islam, it was said, do not conflict with those of the United Nations Charter on Fundamental Rights, "only in Islam the meaning is richer and fuller."134 With the liberals this craving for a distinctive Islamic identity is even more vexing than with the fundamentalists, as a passage from Khalifa 'Abd al-Hakim's Islamic Ideology will show: "Such is the theocracy of Islam which is not to be identified with any theocracy that ever existed. Call it a theocracy or call it a secular state as you please: it synthesizes the virtues of both, repudiating the evils with which they are contaminated."135 In view of this more or less absolute negation of all prescribed forms it is hard to understand why there should at all be any talk of a 'Islamic' state, if not for the purely psychological satisfaction of those in search of identity. Khalifa 'Abd al-IJakim's craving for the manifesta tion of a distinct Muslim personality causes him to conjunct Islam with "ideology", a concept normally designating ideas that determine the conduct of a political movement rather than a religious community. How ever, like most liberals, Khalifa 'Abd al-Hakim is torn between insistence of Muslim individuality and the dream of integrating with a pluralistic world community. The first of these two urges induces him to adopt a terminology of distinctiveness. The second urge renders these terms mean ingless in order to overcome barriers. "Thus the skeletal structure of the SharVa came to be defined primarily in terms of its empty spaces."136 The coronation of this tendency to work out the singularity of Islam is the insistence of some modernists that it not only differs from all other religions, but from religion as such. In a manifesto-like book entitled Islam: A Challenge to Religion, an attempt is made to present it, so to say, as a reality of its own kind, a sui generis manifestation of man with a faith. That peculiar "faith" is a competitor with all the other, naturally inferior, ideologies.137 Such ideologues, especially the Islamists among them, perpetuate that kind of attitude which Watt calls inflationary.138 Jomier has per spicaciously pointed out that this tendency to perceive Islam as a complete system with the concomitant facile course of resorting to undifferentiating answers to the most intricate questions, engenders a habit of evading patient and painstaking investigation. Cultivating a superiority complex,</page><page sequence="22">238 DETLEV H. KHALID as the Islamists do, leads to a lack of general culture and mars the acquisi tion of knowledge and the unfolding of intelligent reflection. Profound scientific toil requires at least a modicum of modesty and humility which cannot develop in an atmosphere of constant apologetics and propaganda. Jomier registers that this attitude is apparent especially in the religious representation of history,139 but it may be added that fundamentalists, notwithstanding their strong numbers at the science departments of many universities, have failed to produce social scientists of mark and have made few contributions worth mentioning to the humanities in general. That, as a result of this process, Islam as a phenomenon in the history of culture is being 'reduced', is further evident from the fundamentalist attitude to theology. They do in fact hardly distinguish between theo logy, philosophy and mysticism. They do not only look askance at all the three but, by a disproportionate stress on the political aspect of the Prophet's career, indirectly tend to expurgate Islam of its religious legacy.140 The whole enterprise may be called a moral shortcut, which, as recent developments have proved, leads into intellectual confusion and social defeat. Here the quest for Muslim identity has led into the void of devious distinctions which serve no constructive purpose but, on the contrary, prevent their proponents from partaking in the effort to make Islam meaningful in the pluralistic community of an industrializing world. Whatever way the responsibility for detheologization may be apport ioned, there is no gainsaying that modern Europe's philosophical, political, and social concepts were made to settle in the Muslim home generally with out asking for divine consent and without the comfort of metaphysics. RECOMPENSATING INTERIORISATION AND THE QUESTION OF AUTHENTICITY However, the process did not stop here. In the foregoing the ques tion as to Islam's continuing prevalence has been answered in the affir mative, although with an important qualification, viz., its role in the colonial situation (including the newly independent Muslim nations) is primarily, though certainly not solely, one of buttressing cultural identity. As this yields a certain spiritual satisfaction and the pride in one's own he ritage required for self-assurance, the Islamic factor remains a force to be reckoned with. This abiding relevancy, however, is not necessarily the same as intellectual competitiveness.141 Discarding of the religious</page><page sequence="23">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 239 legacy, or even too strong an infringement upon it, create a disquietening sense of lost identity. Simultaneously, however, the introduction of new methods of living along with the growing awareness of the ever widening cultural lag create a fear of becoming anachronistic, of turning into "fossils of an extinct civilization."142 Because the advanced part of the world arranges its affairs guided by the superiority of reason and un distracted by any supernatural agencies, the very object of human life is receiving a different and revolutionary interpretation. In this "context of the world, Islam prima facie seems to be out of place.. . "143 and the question poses itself as to how far it is at all adequate to meet the challenges of an increasingly secular and pluralistic world under the dictate of rational thought.144 A leading Islamicist's contention that the question of Islam's adequacy was never raised before the nineteenth century145 can scarcely be contested provided one keeps in view the important difference to former crises. It is the novel phenomenon, alluded to earlier, that Islam in the modern age is no more a politically supreme power, neither in relation to other religions, nor even at the home-front, where it is a constituting factor of importance, but only one among others, surely not absolutely dominant. The new constellation with its concomitant drift into detheologiza tion and the wide-spread attempt to remould Islam as a socio-political system did provide temporary relief for a large number of agonized minds, but apparently it was not cogent enough to be sanctioned by a consensus of the intelligentsia over a span of time sufficient to establish it as the new form. It has been said that, on the whole, the traumatic experience of colonialism and its sequel of incisive changes acted as a deterrent on systematic theological thought. Yet there have been attempts, more numerous than profound, to redefine Islam in a perspective more philoso phical and less platitudinous than in Islamist literature. This search for an answer to the question 'what really is Islam?' soon turned into the dominant motive of the more intellectual Muslim reflections, especially those of the liberals, side by side with the aforementioned trends.146 For Muslim self-comprehension this question - 'what actually is Islam?' - surges with imperious urgency. For the Western observer there appears a phenomenon of a somewhat enigmatic nature in the fact that so many divergent groups insist on being faithful adherents of the creed, progressive reformers no less than conservative theologians or the toiling masses; seemingly irreconcilable opponents lay claim to the same religious basis.147 This naturally resulted in a variety of divergent answers.148</page><page sequence="24">240 DETLEV H. KHAL?D The possibilities discovered in the course of this quest for a definition of "true Islam" merely heightened the already existing confusion and further aggravated the crisis of identity. "For the stakes are nothing less than the meaning of Islam itself. Both modernizers and traditionalists wish to recognize secular life within Islam. The question is: which Islam?"149 This quest resulted in the reopening of the ancient controversy bet ween the concept of Islam as primarily a spiritual inwardness (b?fin) and the other, visualizing it, first and foremost, as a social force with em phasis on its externalities (z?hir). The attitude toward the embodiment of the ??hir or external aspect, viz., the legal system called SharVa, had always been revered as a hallowed norm. But in those ages deviation from the sacred standard would be deplored, if in no other way than by sulky acquiescence, if not genuine so at least pretended, in the forces that be. The faithful were sustained by the pious expectance of the day when the SharVa would be reinforced. Westernization has turned the tables: with the liberal majority of the modern educated class, though not explicitly stated, deviations become the aspiration and the remainder of effective SharVa injunctions are only acquiesced in with the hope for their obsoles cence. In view of the ever increasing adoption of outer aspects from the dominant civilization, with the concurrent fear of losing part of one's own self, the temptation is strong to substitute by making as much as possible of the "inner aspect."150 There are indeed Islamicists who have reached the conclusion that instead of losing its hold following the recession of its ritualism, Islam seems to have retained the emotional attachment of its adherents. With its public role minimised, Islam has, in many cases, found refuge in the consciousness of Muslims and stimulated an interest to have a deeper understanding of it.151 The intellectuals are encouraged in such an approach by the sybilline but reassuring advice Muslims are at times offered by outsiders, namely to make critical choices that allow them to proceed beyond themselves while nevertheless remaining faithful to their own.152 Sympathetic analysts do not only descry the ongoing process of "interiorization", they recommend it as a protective shield as long as westernization acts disruptingly on a backward society. In such a situation, when the individual is torn to the breaking point and society threatened with dissolution, interiorization is thought to counteract and mutually consolidate.153</page><page sequence="25">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 241 The expectation implicit in such expert opinions is that modern Muslim personality be fashioned after the model purveyed by such elements of Islamic mysticism as are acceptable or even stimulating to contemporary philosophy. The scope appears to be vast and promising, so that modern "Muslim liberals and semi-liberals almost naturally turn to such movements within Islam as Mu'tazilism and S?fism for comfort and inspiration."154 The philosophical and humanist strands in the sufi fabric had indeed captivated many of the leading reformers such as Afghani, 'Abduh, G?kalp and Iqb?l.155 However, the difficulties caused by the changed political situation apply to this enterprise hardly less than they do to the revivification of a more Orthodox' theology. The present age is not that of the classical boom of ??fism, but that of the culturally expansionist West. For this very reason the secularist viewpoint of post-'Abduh thinkers appears to many of their coreligionists not as mere ??fi tradition. However faithful such authors may be to their Muslim identity, their ideas are prone to be interpreted as subversive westernization, especially when they dare refer to the Turkish example. Too often, "the Muslim intellectual feels that with his westernization he is paying homage to a religion which competes with his own."156 This applies to the resuscitation of mysticism more than to other forms of Islam because it is said to be closest to Christianity.157 Besides, it is precisely in the domain of ??fism that laborious efforts were expended by Western scholarship to trace each and every element to outside influences, i.e., non-Arab sources.158 This endeavour is, moreover, sustained by Muslim fundamentalists with their aversion to "luxurious theological thought" and derisive equation of mystic with mysterious, 159 topped by their clich? allegation that all that does not conform to their legist "system" of fundamentalist Islam, especially ??fism, is not originally and truly Islamic. For them all philosophical or even theological elaboration of the faith is a corruption that entered with later converts and, in many cases, was plainly the effect of cons piracies to destory the moral fibre of pristine Islam. They proudly adduce Gibb's finding that Islam found its most highly developed expression in law rather than in theology.160 This strong current of legist opposi tion poses a formidable challenge to the liberal's attempt to discover his Muslim identity in the realm of philosophical mysticism. The attacks on ??fism from within and without the pale of Islam raise the question as</page><page sequence="26">242 DETLEV . H ALID to how can a distinct Islamic personality be adumbrated on the basis of questionable authenticity.161 Several liberal apologists have not failed to counter the aspersions cast on the genuine Islamic character of ??fism and much digging has taken place to bring the Muslim contribution to mysticism into the limelight. Besi des, on this point the attitude of the challenging West has been outrightly contradictory. Whereas many tomes have been written to prove ??fism as either a Christian, Persian or Indian product, a similar number of Western scholars has thereupon taken up the cudgels in defence of its Islamic specifity.162 Whatever has found its expression within the framework of Islam and on its field of action, such orientalists say, is to be qualified as Islamic, especially when there is a relationship with Islam's fundamental aspira tions and when it understands itself as Islamic, leaving aside the fact that to S?fism falls the lion's share of preserving and spreading the dogmas of Islam.163 And yet, the issue remains controversial, to the extent that it necessitated a "struggle for the maintenance of authenticity."164 Thus, while deliberating on the minimal requirements or components of an Is lamic community, these redefinitions bring new elements to the fore and eliminate some cherished ones.165 Longing for specifity leads to the culling of materials that appear to be the individual property of Islam. But the discovery that many of these apparently distinctive elements are related to, or have thier origin in extraneous sources of previous ages, poses the problem of authenticity. Adaptations from others may constitute an enrichment provided the new elements are properly assimila ted. The question secretly asked, often perhaps not even consciously, is how far all these cultural borrowings are possible without encroaching upon the very essentials of selfhood? A legacy of cultural synthesis, of adaptation and accultration, may provide the self-confidence necessary to succeed once again. However, doubts about the authenticity of one's own historical contribution to culture can scarcely alleviate the question whether an assimilation is feasible "that would not be tantamount to surrender?"166 MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE IMPACT OF HUMANISM Besides, over the centuries ??fism had often degenerated into charlatanism. It exacted, therefore, much toil until the purified and</page><page sequence="27">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 243 refined particles of its philosophical contents could become visible amongst the chaff. There is still another, though related, reason why such rehabilit ations of Muslim mysticism did not solve the problem of Islamic specifity either. Impressed particularly by the rich variety of ??fism, a leading authority points out that Islam "overflows all definitions,"167 that it has, like oth*r world religions, "as many forms as it has believers."168 Such an approach to the issue is, no doubt, rather pragmatic, but it seems warranted by the fact that one of S?fism's favourite symbols is that of the all-encompassing sea. But it also raises the question as to what justifies us then to "write feasibly and persuasively about 'Islam'?"169 The amorphous flux of protean Muslim experience, in which diversity is as large as number, has proved disruptive especially in the one state that was expressly founded in the name of Islam, Pakistan where the ??fi legacy is particularly pervasive.170 After the traditional dar al-Isl?m distinction, by which the true Muslim could be identified, has been sent reeling into the limbo of ex treme fundamentalist splinter groups, the question of what constitutes a true follower of the faith has become fundamental in a way probably unprecedented and unparalleled in other religions. Nothing illustrates this so effectively as the emphatic pronouncement which many feel them selves constrained to make over and over again, that "he who sincerely affirms that he is a Muslim is a Muslim: no one has the right to qusetion his beliefs... "171 The necessity of proceeding beyond the blemishing of what is not I slamic to a positive definition of the Muslim was acknowledged in Turkey by the creation of an Il?hiyat Fak?ltesi at the University of Ankara and in Pakistan by the establishment of an Islamic Research Institute as a body provided for by the state's constitution. Though both institutions are being criticized for not having come up to the high expectations set in them, the quest continues and outstanding intellectuals do not cease to recall the philosophical mystic Jal?l al-D?n R?m? in Turkey and his mo dern disciple in Pakistan, the mystical philosopher Muhammad Iqb?l, with their drive to seek the definition of a Muslim in the ethical dimensions, in the creation of a special type of man. Here as elsewhere, being Muslim is sometimes explained as a moral obligation toward the rest of mankind. Much is made of the Qur'?nic verse 11:137 in which the community of Islam is said to have been created as "intermediary" (ummatan wasatari).</page><page sequence="28">244 DETLEV H. KHALID This is interpreted as the golden mean between all kinds of aberrations and insidious antinomies, a sound balance between materialist this-worldli ness and spiritualist world-renunciation as well as a via media between the extremes of Capitalism and Communism. Such self-elaboration en visions the Muslim community as the good exemplar172 and "a model for the final combination of humanity."17 3 After Rousseau's Emile, Muslim modernism rediscovered the parable of #ayy Bin Yaqz?n, a precursor of the "new man" in Islamic philosophy;174 Europe's "superman" caused Muslim thinkers to remember the "perfect man" of their own philoso phicall legacy.175 Neo-spiritualist ideals, thus, were closely connected with the wave of European intuitionism at the beginning of the century. As a result of this dependence, these transplants did not thrive very well, espe cially since the socio-economic climate differed so fundamentally from that of their origin. After an initially enthusiastic reception it has, there fore, dawned upon numerous Muslim authors that such rejuvenated spiri tualism does not really lead to new horizons. It is more and more realized that the outcome will be but a repetition of what had already failed once before, that neo-??fism may easily create wrong perspectives and jeopardize progress. The varying economic development and standard of living in different Muslim countries is not without effect on the phases of liberal ism's retreat into ??f? shelters and subsequent reemergence as refurbished ra tionalism. However, for a variety of factors, there is a strong trend moving in this direction and this new realism further narrows the scope for Mus lim specifity. Some thinkers still grope from liberalism toward radicalism within the framework of Islam in History 16 There are others who take the Prophet's message out of its historical setting, if not out of history, however, without yet consenting to identify it broadly with the achieve ments of humanity at large.177 Combating "depersonalization"178 with a new Muslim Personalism, they scarcely find any loophole to proceed beyond some of the medieval positions, thus making a carping critic con clude that there are no other methods "as long as new wine has to be made to flow from old bottles."179 If, as in the case of Turkey, but else where too, a sort of consensus rules that Islam and secularism are to complement each other, the statement of such an ideal alone does not endow it with tangibility, for "what in practice does mutuality mean and what should it do for each?"180 If secularism, in order to keep its balance, needs a religious counterpoise, it finds itself confronted with the old question of "what Islam" to choose for the modus vivendi181</page><page sequence="29">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 245 A symposium on the national culture of Pakistan, largely analogous to comparable debates in Egypt,182 took its bearing from one of the highest judicial authorities, who is a representative exponent of Islam in the liberal age.183 He emphasized the fundamental Islamic values as the basis of his country's nationalism and demanded their unfold ing in social life as the most important and dynamic aspect of culture. In the characteristic vein of his generation and the class to which he be longs, he vaguely identified these fundamental Islamic values with universal humanistic values and stressed the adaptability and elasticity of the Islamic way of life as a guarantee for the dynamism of Muslim culture,184 The reporter of the symposium, himself the nation's foremost critic, represents post-liberal radicalism. He regretted that those Islamic values were not defined as such, "so one could not really go to the root of the problem."185 Whether liberals envisage Islam as a religion, a social order, a political system, or a civilization, the contours remain mostly indistinct. Even with the fundamentalists the stress on the adaptability of the message is so unmitigated that it appears mostly hazy. In most cases Islam is anyhow more defined in terms of what it is not than what it is.186 The crux of the matter appears to be that Islam reduced to its essential moral philosophy seems hardly different from other, similarly purified religions. This can be illustrated at the instance of the great Mufti of Egypt, Muhammad 'Abduh. The towering reformer was once suspected of working for a combination of Islam with Christianity and Judaism, and of being at heart an agnostic.187 At the root of the calu mny there might have been an intuitive apprehension about his accommo dating interpretation of the faith which appeared to many as an excessive "shrinkage of the substance of Islam."188 In view of modernism's inde btedness to western liberalism it ultimately tends "to interpret Islam in terms of liberal humanitarian ideas and values."189 Radical liberals are, therefore, impelled to discard the historical elaborations as mere scho lastic encrustinations and to jettison all save all a modicum that passes as the kernel of supra mundane truth and is equated with the timeless essence common to all religions.190 However, even such attempts are mostly not motivated by the desire to discard specifity.Onthe contrary, it is hoped that "gradually a substantial body of clearly thought-out doctrine will emerge which will be the basis of a scientific reinterpretation of Islam. Such restatement will give strength and solace to many who</page><page sequence="30">246 DETLEV H. KHALID have lost faith in the orthodox interpretations but retain their loyalty to the essence of Islam."191 In this way Islam, no doubt, will be at one with modern science and philosophy. If, however, so many detractions are made in the realm of theology and philosophy, where some wish to discard the classical elabo rations altogether, one might ask if there is anything left on which to establish a humanism that is not only modern but also Muslim.192 Tn such a fully rationalized religion without dogmas to distinguish it from others there remains scarcely any substance to maintain the specific identity required for self-assurance after the experience with imperialism and in the continuing challenge of its aftermath. Certain statements do indeed give the impression as if the only residue left are conventions of geography and national taste or folklore: "They pursue some of the fundamental human values in the name of Christianity. We shall pursue them in the name of Islam."193 Others have begun to ask, at least hypothetically, what rationale there is in holding on to a system with no visible difference in essence but encumbered by the dead weight of a distorted medieval legacy.194 The vast majority of Muslims in the post- colonial era, therefore, share a dilemma: while participating in political freedom and technical advance ment with the rest of the world, they still crave religio-cultural specifity without, however, being fullly confident about it. How deeply the impasse is felt shows the growing despondency of liberal interpreters who see Islam "on a slippery road",195 and who adhere to it in "a strange paradox of elation and disenchantment, of aspiration and illusion."196 Such bewilderment should not be confounded with the slogan "Islam in danger" commonly raised by extremist parties whom it serves as a political stunt. As late as 1956, a learned observer of Islam judged that its authoritarian structure would save it from the fate of Protestantism which looked then as if it were in its last throes under the assault of rationalism. When reason invaded the Protestant Church, he said fur ther, it first gave a new interpretation to revelation, only to jettison it later altogether and to render questionable the very faith of the Church.197 The aforementioned perplexity of a growing number of Muslim intellectuals indicates that Islam seems to be heading in the same direction and that a comparison with the supposed 'solidity' of Catholicism is but a form of wistfullness among Protestant clergymen.</page><page sequence="31">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 247 On the contrary, there appears a close resemblance to Protestant developments in the modernist effort to reduce Islam to a moral system with a utilitarian bearing. This kind of concentration on the ethics of Islam, said to have begun with Muhammad 'Abduh, is diametrically opposed to its transformation into a system of government at the hands of the fun damentalists. With the latter the moral teachings lose much of their im mediacy because of the onesided political accentuation and the importance attached to rituals through which they inculcate their authoritarian prin ciple of order.198 In either case, Islam is estranged from its primordial role as a discipline preparatory of the last judgment and life hereafter, on which Catholicism can still insist by dint of its central authority.199 Therefore, it seems rather unwarranted to look at Islam with rueful Protestant yearning and romantically transform it into the image of a monolithic Caliphal power finally awakening from the slumber of centuries. All evidence points to a severe intellectual crisis which Islam experienced during the nineteenth century, "and from which it emerged damaged, enfeebled, no longer the living faith shared by ruler and subject, but as an ideology, a poli tical weapon against European domination or else a system of ethics which educated men, unable to believe in revelation but shrinking from atheism, were disposed to adopt as most convenient and least contentious."200 The final crumbling of the dogmatic bulwark, though is a pheno menon of the second half of the twentieth century, and the full onslaught of historical criticism is still held in abeyance by the defensive mood of Muslims who find themselves among the political underdogs on the present world scene. In case of a possible relaxation after the attainment of genuine emancipation from the colonial status, such a critique of the sources is bound to erupt and "we may anticipate new Islamic penetrations into the large territory of Muhammad's personality in the action of the Qur'?nic whole."201 RELIGIOUS IMPASSE AND THE NEW FRAME OF REFERENCE Manifestly, it would be misleading to view the whole present develop ment in terms of a parallel with Muslim responses to the cultural chal lenges faced in the eighth and ninth century. The 20th century constella</page><page sequence="32">248 DETLEV H. KHALID tion differs significantly, as has been alluded to earlier. Looking at the responses to the encounter with the modern West, one is all the same, struck by the basic similarity with the solutions of yore. Islam, in its earliest phase, appeared as a comprehensive world view. As long as the fervour of the first hour precluded rational systematization and philosophical defini tions, there was dynamic harmony in the amorphous edifice of the new faith. Once faced with intellectual challenges, a kind of compartmentalization began to take place. In the minds of its adherents, Islam was then under stood in a narrower sense, either as a canon law primarily serving as a system of government, or a scholastic theology, a philosophy, or a mystic faith. Some outstanding individuals used to experience these four major manifestations of Islam as phases in their intellectual career, normally in the sequence indicated above. On account of Ghaz?lfs autobiographical treatise, Deliverance from Error 202 this development has practically become a classical career for a Muslim thinker. The final outcome is a kind of synthesis with a stress on the mystic element of faith and a strong emphasis on the moral teachings. After a period of rejection, the exter nalities of religious practice are largely rehabilitated and philosophy as well as rationalism in theology are ostensibly discarded. Nonetheless, it appears that usually neither the rehabilitation of the externalities nor the rejection of rationalism is as complete as professed. Often the quest ends with a literary solution in that a mystifying parable is taken recourse to which pretends to unravel the ultimate wisdom without in reality clarifying much.203 In order to make things more explicit one might even say that the quest ends on an eschatological note leaving as many options open as it is supposed to have blended into an harmonious, unit. Thus, the final position tends to be ambiguous, allowing diver gent interpretations. The successors are then prone to split up into the same old factions or, individually, to repeat the process all over again. Muhammad4 Abduh in Egypt and Muhammad lqb?l in Pakistan, with their respective followers may be regarded as examples of the Ghaz?l? career in modern times.204 Apart from the variations of details, the decisive difference between these models, ancient and modern, seems to lie chiefly in the fact that such a response is hardly any longer workable because the present challen ges contain some etirely new elements. It is sometimes argued that even Ghaz?l? cannot be regarded as the success as that he is usually celebrated. His reconciliation of divisive accentuations brought about an admirable</page><page sequence="33">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 249 degree of consensus and stability, but it also contributed to the stagnation for which the "Middle Ages" of Islam became notorious.205 The failure of contemporary Muslim thinkers to produce anything more than sophisti cated emulations of the outworn pattern leads to the question whether it is at all possible to go ahead with Islam and proceed beyond the refurbished positions of earlier reconcilers to anything breaking out of the ancient grooves while remaining distinctly Islamic. Modernists sometimes assume that Islam is not a finished product, that there is in it something more than its actual history. Such assumptions have met with the alarm of scholars who see therein an illusion that makes it "extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a sound and genuine understanding of Islam, which is indispens able even for the reinterpretation of its central teachings and ideals."206 There is, of course, the danger that such abstractions may defeat the pur pose of the radical interpreters in that they would merely minimize, and eventually efface, the desired Islamic specifity. What seems still more significant, however, is that the boldest pretensions of reinterpretation and reconstruction apparently do not scucceed in devising anything but repetitions of historical precedents, not to speak of transcending history. Contrary to the above-mentioned apprehensions of detached Islamicists, the subjectivist insight of latter-day interpreters, arbitrary though it may be, has so far scarcely been able to propound anything perfectly new that stands genuinely outside and above Muslim history.207 There is, no doubt, a tendency to proclaim this as an aspiration, and it is more because of such declared intentions than of any factual breakthrough, that scholars have frequently raised the question of a regulative principle of authority to provide guidance for such endeavours. In view of this impotent and inconclusive shuttle service between the discarding of history and its affirmation, an incisive student of Muslim society has argued forcefully and cogently that "Islamic modernism to be effective must either reform doctrine completely in order to make it relevant, or abandon it altogether."208 Muslim thinkers may feel inspired by the ethos of their religio cultural legacy. There are many who still believe that ethics inspired by the Qur'?nic sermons can guide the conduct of Muslims, individually and as a community, so to say politically. It is often held that Islam may even be served by modern ideologies inasmuch as they could furnish it with</page><page sequence="34">250 DETLEV H. KHALID terminology and conceptual weapons, a sort of philosophical know-how. Properly applied, these ideologies could, even help to sharpen Muslim identity by bringing to light some of its hitherto hidden virtues. It has also been said that Muslims, almost unanimously, still believe that Islam can and should, be a constituent of humanity as whole, a factor of peace serving to ameliorate universal civilization. 209 It is, all the same, diffi cult to visualize how, in the broad stream of humanistic tendencies, such distinctive elements can remain substantial and distinct enough to vouch safe the specifity that is still longed for.210 It is the contention of the present writer that a religious reforma tion does not seem feasible after Westernization. Various nationalisms may be able to profit from the cultural enrichment of their legacy as a result of the many centuries when their identity was derived from the universal religious community of Islam. However, a specific Muslim iden tity transcending national boundaries seems no longer intellectually ten able. Efforts to intellectualize the religious heritage lead, sooner or later, to a merger and identification with the achievements of humanity at large. In the course of this process, the margin of a separate Muslim identity narrows continuously. The craving for such Muslim individuality within a world community is in any case conditioned by a given historical situation and by the fact that colonialism invaded Muslim territories at a time when the old religious identity was still intact. To a considerable degree it is the memory of foreign militancy against Muslims qua Muslims that has so far sustained an Islamic identity. Had imperialism in its first encounter conflicted with developed national identities, a reconqust of Muslim identity might never have been felt as such an urgent necessity. As a result of the peculiar con frontation of European nation states with a still largely operative Muslim universalism, Islamic identity was on the one hand sujected to a break-up in emulation of Europe's development. On the other hand, much of its emotional hold was conserved, if not fortified, precisely be cause it had constituted the focal point of Western assault. That it was but the target of a sham attack on the superstructure, whereas the real aim was primarily economic expansionsim, is surely important. How ever, the awareness of this scarcely penetrated into the depth of the self view, which remained that of Muslims suffering, Western aggression as the result of an age-old religious antagonism. After the own religious vision had dimmed with Muslim intellectuals, there remained thus "a kind of</page><page sequence="35">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 251 secular patriotic attachment to Islam as a cultural community."211 This sentiment plays an important role in the sequel to the encounter with imperialism, intellectually however, it has not been able to develop into a specific factor of distinction from the main currents of contemporary thought such as secular nationalism, fascism, and socialism. It has not provided, at least not cogently, an autochthonous substitute for the lost religious identity of yore. W. Montgomery Watt, as a religious Western student of Islam, speaks in near eschatological terms about an "Islamic vision," and men who are "becoming aware that there is something at the heart of their reli gion which is notultimately affected by occidental scientific thought, so that the Muslim can hold up his head proudly among the adherents of the great religions."212 That this "Islamic vision" does not assume distinct contours in Watt's learned discourse either, might be largely due to its quality as wishful thinking of a liberal Christian who hopes for the survival of religion as such. Ultimately, all his uminations about the problems besetting the recovery of Muslim identity end on a question mark too. There are others who feel they still need Islam as a basis from which to depart into a new world. There is no question of sticking to this basis, but, they feel, it provides the ground from which to launch the new enterprise. Their viewpoint can be translated as meaning to say that in order to catch a train there has to be a station, and for Muslims Islam is still closest at hand. The Egyptian Badawi, for instance, who has set out for existentialism, "notre nouvelle Weltanschauung" feels that Kierkegaard as a point of departure would involve an irksome detour via Protestant Europe; it it easier to reach the destination by starting from Muslim mysticism.213 In any event, the frame of reference is Western culture, in fact, the use of Islamic elements serves here but as a means to achieve Wester nization more effectively. This, indeed, seems to apply to most of the attempts aiming at the conversion of religion into culture efforts that purport to end the duplicity of world views and the duplication of persona lities.2 14 Such ventures acknowledge the failure of religion per se to pro vide the appropriate symbols in order to efficiently relate new lifeways to changing values. The gradual drift from the concern with Islan as a re ligion to the care for Islam as a culture may not be radical enough a cure to restore congruency of attitudes in a situation that is characterized by</page><page sequence="36">252 DETLEV H. KHAHD a "psychocultural gap between words and deeds."215 Even so, it indicates a way out of the religious impasse and h a step toward uniting the elites and enlisting the masses. The diminishing margin of Islamic specifity makes it appear more likely that ultimately one of the liberal or socialist models developed out side the Muslim realm be transplanted to it more or less in its entirety. This might further speed up cultural planification and the disintegration of religion, however, with the prospect of a greater degree of success in economic development and political competitiveness.216 While Muslim identity is still a force to be reckoned with and a preoccupation of literary activity, it has to share this preeminence more and more with the quest for Arabism, N?gritude, national culture, and other categories all serving as answers to the question: 'How can I change and yet be my true self?' In this common search for identity, Muslim individuality, along with the other specifities, undergoes a transformation insofar as the old philosophical question 'What am I?' is giving way to a different formulation: what shall I become?' The new tendency shows greater willingness to let unfold a culture of 'becoming' rather than be intoxicated with a culture of identity.217 NOTES 1.

Fanon obviously considers personal disintegration as implicit in social disintegration and thus dating, at its earliest, to the first encounter with the might of colonialism. "Colonisability", then, is the state of mind created by the shock of defeat. Wal ther Braune, as a philosopher of the history of religion, goes back farther. Dis cussing the ups and downs of historical consciousness, he sees it emerging with Muhammad against the pre-Islamic poets, then diminish, but resurge when the 'Abbasids ushered in the "classical" Islam of the Mu'tazila. In post-classical Islam, for which I decide to adopt the term "medieval" (though this is somewhat vague and controversial), historical consciousness declined again, leading to the prevalence of "cyclic" mysticism. Ottoman state power was but a firm and shin ing corset, the decaying man beneath it turned increasingly schizophrenic. Braune explains how during that period Muslims were about to loose their historical con sciousness more and more and were thus compelled to accept a reduced self.

The imposition of modernity in the form of a confrontation with the other compels Muslims to make an effort largely unknown during the "Middle Ages" of Islam. It is the effort to understand the other, to break through the shell of paralyzing solipsism that characterised much of medieval Muslim society and still persists in many areas in one form or the other. Understanding the other, again, presupposes self-understanding. The dilemma of the East (mis) understanding the West, and vice-versa, is, to a considerable extent, due to the lack of self-interpreta tion on part of the Muslim world. As late as 1957 an Arab author deplored that "all the self-knowledge, the history, the culture, even the ambitions of the Arabs, have been defined and articulated in and by the West in the last two hundred year's."

See the succinct analysis by Leonard Binder, "Radical-Reform Nationalism", p. 106: "But religion is not simply inversely proportional to Westernism, nor is nationalism directly proportional thereto."

Detlev Khalid, "Atat?rk's Concepts of Islamic Reform anu Muslin* Unity", hi Journal of the Regional Cultural Institute (RCD); Vol. VII, No. 1 (Tehran: Winter, 1974). The two major types of response, cultural synthesis as against unconditional Westernization, roughly to be designated as Arab versus Turkish approach, were in a way forestalled by the Indian controversy between Jamil al-D?n al-Afgh?n? and Sir Sayyid Ahmad Kh?n. These notorious polemics did not, as the surface suggests, stem from a difference in the degree of religiosity. The opponents did in fact share the same ideals of rationalism, reform and scant orthodoxy. The fun damental difference lay in the purpose for which Islam was employed. With Sayyid Ahmad it was to serve as a bridge to the Britishers with whom he wanted Muslims to merge. For this reason he stressed Islam' skinship with Christianity, making them appear as more or less one monotheistic faith in contradistinction to polytheistic Hinduism. With Sayyid Jam?l al-D?n Islam was to serve the national thrust against imperialism,therefore he accentuated its differences with Christianity. By way of generalization it can be said that the Indian Sayyid propagated a Muslim enlightenment in order to demolish communal barriers, whereas the Iranian Sayyid preached the same but with the purpose of fortifying the pride of distinctness (See Nikki Keddie, An Islamic Response to Imperialism, Berkeley and Los Angeles: 1968, p. 67 f.). How this misfired in either case and how a change of tactics be came necessary especially in the latter case is not of immediate concern here, though it will be alluded to is the course of the present study.</page><page sequence="39">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 255 20.

See Hisham Sharabi, "The Crisis of the Intelligentsia," p. 189: "It may be said, at the risk of over-simplification, that all the inherited problems in this connection centre around the fundamental vagueness existing in the relationship between Arabism, as a socio-political movement, and Islam." 22.

For a Western assessment of "so parlous a situation" see Sylvia Haim, Arab Nationalism - An Anthology (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles: 1962), p. 6: "The assault which Warn had to endure in the nineteenth century was twofold. It consisted, in the first place, of military attack on Muslim states or their political subjugation by different European powers, and, in the second place, of criticism of Islam as a system of beliefs and a way of life that was belitt led, ridiculed, and made to seem backward and barbaric in comparison with the achievements of western learning, philosophy, and technical advantage. The latter attack was perhaps even more dangerous and insidious than political and military subjugation, for it could penetrate the spiritual defenses of the Muslim community and of its intellectual leaders, thereby effecting a dissolution of Islam such as foreign rule, by itself, could hardly accomplish." 35.

Among the approaches of Western specialists that of Walther Braune stands out for its singularity. He obviously subscribes to the views of those who regard the influence of Islamic culture on the West as the decisive pro genitor of the Renaissance, though he would surely guard against the inflations customary with modernist apologetics where such references are used to build up the argument that Muslims need feel no qualms about cultural borrowings because they merely take back something that actually belongs to them. Braune gives it another dimension. Instead of recommending the eighth and ninth century Muslim responses to other civilizations as a model, his exposition suggests the in ference that Muslims might rather draw inspiration from the West's receptivity to Muslim culture during the Middle Ages as an example of courageous and, therefore, successful acculturation.

The fictive idea that all this came from Muhammad was universally accepted, and the conception of the unchanging character of Islamic knowledge thereby given deeper roots. Up to this point the achievement of the intellectuals was impressive, but they had made it even more difficult for their successors to adapt Islamic ideation to the needs of later centuries. It was no longer to be possible to invent fresh sayings of Muhammad, for the corpus of 'sound' traditions had been closed." 48.

In this sense his outlook and method are analogous to those of the whole series of Arabic philosophers, from al-Kindi</page><page sequence="43">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 2 59 to Ibn Rushd and al-Sh?r?z?, in whose thougt theological and philosophical concerns have always coalesced." 53. See Gibb, Trends, pp. 11-45. His special reference is to the Pakistan? national poet philosopher Muhammad Iqb?l, whom he quotes on p. 112: "The transfer of the power of ijtih?d from individual representatives of schools to a Muslim legislative assembly which, in view of the growth of opposing sects, is the only possible form fjrn?* can take in modern times, will secure contri butions to legal discussions from laymen who happen to possess a keen insight into affairs." Sir Muhammad Iqb?l, The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam (London: 1930), p. 165. 54. One needs, I believe, Gibb's predilection for orthodoxy to subscribe to his mini mizing the history of doctrinal warfare when he sums it up as a gradual reducing of divergences by consensus. (Trends, p. 12). The co-existence of the four main schools of Islamic law, to which he refers as indicative of "remarkable" legist tolerance (Trends, p. 14), is hardly so significant a flexibility as to warrant this con clusion. Besides, they do by no means always coexist peacefully. Especially Indian Islam, but Arab and Turkish not much less, has a proclivity to militate for the supremacy of one school at the expense of others. For the tendency to make the Hanaf i school a kind of 'national church', reiterated in recent election mani festos of fundamentalist parties in Pakistan, see Detlev Khalid, "'Ubayd-All?h Sindh?," in JJak?m Sa'?d, ed., Main Currents of Contemporary Thought in Pakistan. How much scholars such as Gibb succumb at times to the self-propaganda of orthodoxy is borne out by the example of Snouck Hurgronje, Mohamme danism, p. 84: "Thus it was possible for innumerable shades of Catholicism and pro testantism to live under one roof; with a good deal of friction, it is true, but without definite breach of schism, no one sect being able to eject another from the commnunity " There are, however, enough precedents in history, the forced migration of Ib?tf? Kh?rijites from Iraq into Algeria is but one of the better known instances. For the history of internecine strife cf. George Makdisi, "Ash'ari and the Ash'arites in Islamic Religious History," in Studia Islamica; Tomes 17-18 (Paris: 1962-3); and, by the same author, "Law and Traditionalism in the Institutions of Learning of Medieval Islam," in G. von Grunebaum, ed., Theology and Law in Islam (Wiesbaden: 1971). 55. This factor is surely of paramount importance for the much debated issue of Mus lim decline. As with the many other answers proffered, reference to the unresol ved wrangling of the schools hardly suffices as a total explanation. However, the failure to evolve appropriate institutions for the enactment of Islamic principles is increasingly being acknowledged in more recent modernist literature. Muhammad Iqb?l, Reconstruction, pp. 149 f., seemed at least to be heading toward some kind of recognition of this phenomenon as one of the causes of the fall.</page><page sequence="44">260 DETLEV H. KHALID 56. Gibb, 7rerafr,p.ll. 57. Gibb, Trends, p. 15; cf. Cragg, Counsels, pp. 74, 83. 58. Hurgronje, Mohammedanism, p. 84. Gibb, while discussing proposals to remould the institution of ijm?' on lines of western-democracy, accuses Muslim reformers of having ultimately no trust in the mass of men (Trends, p. 118). He does so because of his concept of tjm?' as a general will that can be built up only by gradual stages over a period of many generations. But whereas he aims at the liberal reformers, the argument seems to apply better to their opponents, the Islamists (in the sense of both traditional orthodoxy and fundamentalist revivalism). That they have no trust in the mass of men need not be inferred, it is plainly and profusely admitted in their litera ture. Whether there is any guarantee that any group of * Ulama? will interpret the conscience of the community as a whole is doubtful for the simple reason that there appears to be no group among them with such an aspiration, the ostracisa tion of one section of the community or the other being a cardinal characteristic of Islamism. Elsewhere Gibb himself points to the fact that "not for the first time, the ijm?' of the people is opposed to the ijm?* of the learned." (Trends, p. 38). It is difficut to surmise that he refers to any other but the observable fact that the'iea rned', i. e., the 'Ulama' of Islamism, are loosing their hold on the popular masses. Gibb's mystification of ijm?6 reminds of Iqb?l's ultimate reality where there is no distinction between sacred and profane (Reconstruction, pp. 154-5). Looked at from such an idealistic viewpoint, Muslim reformers are certainly heretics, for them ultimate ideals cannot have more but a solely ultimate relevance. They feel naturally urged to gauge the general will not only of coimng generations but, first and foremost, of this present-day community. To them a representative assem bly is necessarily still the best conceivable unifying force. They surely have to controvert some of the decisions of the extant schools. But to say, as Gibb does, that such a council would only be a factor of disunity and conflict within the Muslim community, is to obscure the notion of democracy. This attitude betrays a curious mixture of defeatism and utopianism. As such it re minds of a prominent Pakistani liberal, Khalifa 'Abd al-IJakim. This former director of the Institute of Islamic Culture in Lahore despaired because no nation, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, has yet succeeded in discovering the right method of choosing an assembly and finding a workable modus operandi : "Muslims continued to hold it as a faith that a true Islamic society must be socialistic and democratic, and that absolute monarchy is un-Islamic, but history was not yet prepared for the political realisation of the Islamic ideal: the early few years of Islam remained only a sacred memory and an ideal to cherish, with little hope of realisation until humanity advances towards it by evolution or by revolu tion." Khalifa 'Abd al-?ak?m, Islamic Ideology (Lahore: 1951), p. 225. Whereas the Islamists generally have fa?th only in the forebears, some liberal scholars such as Gibb, Khalifa 'Abd al-#akim, and ftusayn Nasr, have faith only in a distant future and distrust the present. See Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Ideals and Realities of Islam (London: 1966), p. 100: "Some modernized Muslims, who instead of wanting to make man God</page><page sequence="45">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 261 like wish to make God man-like, especially like twentieth century man, have tried simply to equate ijnuV with parliamentary 'democracy'. This, however, is not exactly the case because, first of all, ijnuV can operate only where the Qur'?n and Qadith have not clarified a certain aspect of the Law, to that its function is in this sense limited, and secondly, it is a gradual process through which the com munity over a period of time comes to give its consensus over a question of law". Like Gibb, Muhammad Asad, too, states that "no individual person or group can claim the right to decide any cotroversial question on their own authority." This goes undisputed. But Asad also writes that an opinion or any controversial issue is no more than a suggestion, subject to approval or rejection by the community. Cf. Muhammad Asad, Islam and Politics (Geneva: 1963), p. 10. Here the Islamist Asad seems to come closer to the spirit of democracy than the Western scholar Gibb. The latter, quite obviously, confuses a modern parliament on Muslim soil with the medieval rule of the clergy in Europe. Parlia ments in Muslim countries, such as the Pakistani National Assembly deciding the Ahmadiya issue in 1974, do occasionally resemble authoritarian church councils more than parliaments in the Western sense, but Gibb discusses principles. His argument could have become cogent had he demonstrated the necessity to separate decision-making in matters religious from secular legislation. But this he opposes as it runs counter to the interests of the conservatives whose cause he has espoused. He does not concede to Muslim reformists the right to envisage parliamentary democracy as a means to decide religious affairs of the community because of his lack of confidence in their ability to represent the popular aspirations. These, he holds, are best taken care of by the 'Ulam?' who assumed this role in the Middle Ages of Islam. 59. See Detlev Khalid, "Laicism," in Tongue, Atat?rk. 60. See Cragg, Counsels, p. 68 f. 61. Sharabi, "Crisis,*' p. 189, characterises the contemporary Arab intellectual as a cultural hybrid suffering from inner polarity as a result of his deepening exposure to the West with concomitant cultural dislocation: "It is impossible to be bilingual and bicultural and maintain a true unity of personality?much less so when the rootendess in this lingual and cultural duality is neither deep enough nor secure enough to provide the foundations which make for a healthy, independent outlook. For this reason it is inevitable that the essen tial features of the contemporary Arab intellectual should be an unreconciled, double view of things, an inconsistent ethical plurality, and a vague intellectual relativism." 62. See von Grunebaum, Modern Islam, p. 267, n. 39; also p. 152. : "The self-contradiction inherent in non-Europeans venturing all their energy to transfer western civilization to their homelands, while simultaneously seeking to disparage it, is attributable to two facts: (1) though the manifold crises accompanying the transition, initiated often with great awkwardness and always with great impatience, must be laid at the door of Others', the process as a whole should not be wrecked; and (2) self-esteem, which might seem jeopardized by the enthusiastic surrender of inherited goals, is to be secured by stubborn insis</page><page sequence="46">262 DETLEV H. KHALID tence on the superiority of the native tradition of past achievement, which, however, is in fact treated like an enemy to be overcome." To some, such as Egypt's best-known literary figure, T?h? Qusayn, this situa tion appeared "extremely contradictory." He saw the Arab world torn between the inducement of modern living conditions to adopt western civilization and the simultaneous attachment to inherited religious ideals. Cf. Taha H?sain, "Tendances religieuses de la lit?rature ?gyptienne d'aujourd'hui," in Cahiers du Sud, 1947, p. 239; quoted by Marcel Colombe, L'?volution de l'Egypte, 1924 1950 (Paris: 1951), p. 150. The issue is perceptively dealt with by Braune, Islamische Orient, p. 117. Significantly, von Grunebaum's simile of the Janus-face had struck others before him, e.g., H.I. Katibah, The New Spirit in Arab Lands, p. 141, where he elaborates on it by saying: "It is to this dual nature of the early Arab reawakening that much of the confusion in today's Arabic literary schools is due." 63. Rondot, Musulmans d'aujourd'hui, , 231. 64. Smith, Islam in Modern History, p. 170. "For the Renascence in Europe, the re-birth of classicism, was a revival of ideas and attitudes, particularly humanist. The Greek achievement was primarily intellectualist. These ideas and attitudes proved immensely creative, in their second birth as in their first. But what they created in the second instance, the social institutions, law, etc., were new; relevant to the new age of the Modern West. The renascence of Islam, on the other hand, has to a significant degree meant to many Arabs and Pakistanis a revival of the institutions of their classical age? Perplexity ensues because the very problem of modernity lies in fact that the institutions of the seventh to tenth centuries do not seem effective or relevant in the twentieth. Some would perhaps argue that the notion of re nascence is more valid for philosophies; that of reformation for religions." 65. Gibb, Trends, pp. 2 ff. Later, on p. 65, however, he describes the concept of knowledge in historical Islam as "a solid and immobile mass", which "crushed independent intellectual activity under the dull weight of authority and eventually destroyed the rich and varied harvest garnered by the philosophical and scientific curiosity of medieval Muslim scholars." This, I believe, not only allows but even demands to distinguish between the "vitality"he ascribed to the Islam of the eighteenth century and the creativity which others miss in that period. 66. See J. Schacht, "Classicisme, traditionalisme et ankylose dans la loi religieuse de PIslam," in von Grunebaum &amp; Hartner, eds., Classicisme et d?clin culturel dans l'histoire de l'Islam, (Paris: 1957), pp. 147-8, 155-6, 157.

Wilfred Cantwell Smith, "The Intellectuals in the Modern Development of the Islamic World," in Sydney N.

For the demands of western critics on such a synthesis see von Grunebaum's projection of the Tunisian Mabjnb bin M?l?d whom he quotes approvingly, to wit: "By uniting eastern and western values we do not expose ourselves to the charge of cheap amalgamation tawdry eclecticism, so long as the new Tu nisia succeeds in uniting only those values that she can master with originality through energetic spiritual experience and infusing them in one caldron of her new, blazing intellectuality, intently aspiring to the service of reality and its laws and the noble ideals of mankind."

Baber Johansen, Mubammad ffusain Haikal; throughout, but in particular Chapter VIII with the section on "Die Krise der Liberalen." Abdallah Laroui, La crise des intellectuels Arabes. [Paris 1973]. In the final analysis, this crisis can be reduced to the old conflict of two major contending attitudes, referred to earlier. Gibb, Trends, p. 16, describes it with simplifying lucidity: "When these new stresses arise and the old social structure begins to show cracks, men's minds are naturally confused by conflicting counsels. Shall they pull down the old building and hurriedly erect a new one? Or clamp the old walls together and fill in the cracks? Or patch it up with new bricks here and there? Above all, are the old foundations still sound ? If the old building must come down, can they serve for the new one? The present is just such a time of change, conflict, and confusion in Muslim society." 71. See Colombe, L'?volution, p. 150. In a way this is the leitmotif of Braune, Islamische Orient, especially in the section on "Zweifel und Abwehr," p.62, also p. 117. Von Grunebaum, Modern Islam, p. 129, taking the clue, concludes: "For change not only enriches life; it blocks access to trusted spheres of experience, especially in the religious sphere where the ecstatic, like the quietism of mystical piety, falls into disrepute and gradually withdraws from the approved realm of experience." In the context of the issue of specifity-anxiety, Cragg, Counseh, p. 9, quotes from Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, where the older generation says, "How</page><page sequence="48">264 DETLEV H. KHALID shall we know it's us without our past?" The young retort, "How shall we be ourselves without this present?" With the pace and thrust of changes not resulting from an evolutionary pro cess but imposed by forces that were centuries of development ahead, colonisable Muslims did not even have the respite to solve dissensions as part of that familiar generation gap which, in the West, had generated enough of turmoil. Apart from naturally exacerbated clashes of the generations as coro'lary of such situation, in the Muslim case generations had to resolve the conflict practically within them selves. Lacking the time to sort out things through confrontation with elders? or youngsters?and instead of seeing themselves either justified or replaced by a more natural process, they had the confrontation taking place, more or less, within their consciences alone,?and these were commensurately torn apart. 72.

For the reasons of theological unresponsiveness and Gibb's defense of it, see Trends, pp. 47-8, and p. 40: "But a school with a tradition of nearly eight hundred years behind it and, still more, a school which stands throughout the world of Islam as the guardian and (in a certain sense) the authoritative exponent of Islamic ortho doxy cannot easily trim its sails to every passing wind." 74. Lacouture, Egypt in Transition, p. 431. Cf. Cragg, Counsels, pp. 69-72. Speaking about endeavours to reconstruct Islam, von Grunebaum warns against the illusion created by the 'Ulama' with their more or less complete re hearsals or "more or less systematic summary of traditional tenets." These abundantly available writings do not qualify as fresh thought. G.E. von Grunebaum, "Some Recent Constructions and Reconstructions of Islam," in Carl Leiden, ed., The Conflict of Traditionalism and Modernism, p. 142. 75. See Gibb, Trends, pp. 54-55, with special reference to the 'excommunication* of the Azharite Shaykh 'Ali 'Abd al-R?ziq and others. Likewise Cragg, Counsels, pp. 85-6, about T?h? ljusayn as a prominent instance of a scholar who even had been through Al-Azhar and yet exemplified detheologization in that he shunned the criticism of dogma after an initial rebellion against the Azharites had ended in a draw. 76. Lacouture, Egypt in Transition, p. 438. Recalling "the enormous task which was nonetheless undertaken by the Christian thinkers, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Teilhard de Chardin," Lacouture writes that the Muslim theologians of Al-Azhar are unfit to: "bring about in Islam that revision of values which has been the hallmark of European thought since the Renaissance, or to shape the ideals and problems of the modern world in an Islamic mould which alone, so far, has been capable of striking a chord in the conscience of Muslim peoples. ..though this would have enabled them to canalize through the faith that circulation of ideas within a society which is now stretched to the breaking-point between the Middle Ages and the twentieth century."</page><page sequence="49">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 265 Pp. 437-8 ; quoted drom Francis Berthier, "Rencontre de Flslam et du monde moderne,** in the review Letters Nouvelles, August 7,1956. The illustrious Dutch orientalist, Hurgronje, did not mince words either: "The treasuries of Islam are excessively full of rubbish that has become en tirely useless; and for nine or ten centuries they have not been submitted to a revision deserving that name." Snouck Hurgronje, Mohammedanism, p. 120. So offensive this finding may sound, many Muslims are no less acerbic in their statements about the religious heritage than this official of the colonial administration. As such the view is not entirely unrepresentative of a widely pre vailing mood. Cragg, Counsels, p. 190, formulates succinctly : *But the doctrinal, Qur'?nic, Prophetic, exegetical, philosophical corol laries still lag behind the lawyers and the reformers." Cf. Watt, Theology, pp. 174-7. 77. Lacouture, Egypt in Transition, p. 430. 78. See J.-M. Abd-el-Jalil, Aspects int?rieurs de l'Islam (Paris: 1949), p. 78 More differentiatingly, Walther Braune, Islamische Orient, p. 100, dates the evolution of legist Islam back to the overpowering of the Mu'tazila by their fun damentalist opponents. The notion of Islam as a *complete-code-of-life' was somehow adumbrated right from the start, but it gained ascendency, Braune avers, with Ibn IJanbal and the traditionists (mubaddithin) during the reign of the ' Abb?sid Al-Mutawakkil. 79. For a historian's evaluation of the predominance of one form over the other and the difficulty in judging what is orthodox and what heterodox, see Claude Cahen, L'?laboration de l'Islam (Paris : 1961 ). 'Ali *Abd al-R?ziq in his AUisl?m wa usili al-bukm (Cairo: 1925), is perhaps one of the most radical thinkers who would take up Islamic development right from the date of the Prophet's death and restart it all over again the way they deem it best. The Algerian M?lik Bin Nab?y leaves a slightly broader margin to past history by incorporating the idealized period of the earliest Caliphate. In this he resembles certain fundamentalists, but he is more convincing in his call for a resumption of a development that, for him, as interrupted by the battle of ?iff?n. See Bennabi, Vocation. 80. See Jomier, Islam actuel, p. 172. Speaking about the theologians who so successfully defended the trans cendental doctrines of the Qur'?n against pantheistic aberrations, Gibb, Trends, p. 24, writes: "Of the depth and sincerity of their conviction there can be no question. But, if we are justified in holding that there can be no living religion without inner tension, it would seem to follow that their complete victory would have resulted in a disastrous loss of spiritual vitality in Islam. That is what I meant by caTing their system a 'transcendental mausoleum,* and I have al-Ghaz?li</page><page sequence="50">266 DETLEV H. KHALID on my side, at least, for that is precisely the charge, which he brought against it." 81. Lacouture, Egypt in Transition, p. 430. Cf. Smith, Modern History, p. 131, where he speaks of a "skirting of modern intellectual problems" in the context of Qur'?n exegesis. 82. This is the view of Mubammad Iqb?l, Reconstruction, pp. 149-151, proffered in defense of the 'Ulam?'. Cf. Gibb, Trends, p. 136. 83. That the fault may lie less with an inherent tendency than with the vested interests derived from an earlier constellation has been pinpointed by Watt, Intellectual, p. 89, with regard to the eleventh century and earlier: "It must be noticed here, however, that the failure to become adapted to new situations may not be due to faults in the dogmas themselves, for it is usually possible to effect some refinement in the conceptions. Most often the difficulty is that the bearers of the dogmas feel that their privileged status is being threa tened and so are unwilling to make modifications." For an 'apology' of the conservative stand see Gibb, Mohammedanism, p. 136. "The claims of the theologians to religious leadership were based on their exclusive possession of the sciences of theology and law, and their position as the sole authoritative exponents of Islamic doctrine. It was, as we have seen, after infinite trouble and difficulty that these sciences had been built up, and their acquisition involved long and arduous study. It was by their means that the sub stance of the Faith had been preserved against both heretical 'innovations' in doctrine and the attempts of the secular to override its privileges and obligations. The theologians were justly proud of their system and jealeus for the maintenance of its authority." 84. See Iqb?l, Reconstruction, pp. 149 f.

And yet, "his chief influence on Muslim scholars of the next two centuries, to judge from references to him, was in the field of jurisprudence!" Gibb, Trends, p. 118, lauds the 'Ulam?' for their "profound sense of historical continuity and of their own responsibility for safeguarding it. This was, indeed, their primary and all-important funo tion.. . " Another explanation, though more of 'surface' character and rather secondary to the legist tradition, if not actually its outcome, is proffered on p. 117:</page><page sequence="51">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 267 "But long centuries of submission to secular government induced a tradition of political quietism which cannot easily or quickly be shaken off and still further inhibited the development of political thought and its application to changing circumstances. The rise of nationalism has thus taken the 'Ulama* unaware and found them unprepared to examine its religious implications." 87. Ziya G?kalp, Turkish Nationalism and Western Civilization, p. 27. This attitude left its distinct mark on what has come to be considered as the 'typical* or predominant exposition of Islam. The preponderance of the conserva tive view led Erwin Rosenthal, National State, to the generalization that: "In this context religion (din) clearly means short'a, and it cannot be re peated too often that what matters for a Muslim is the character and intention of the law of the state." 88.

"Sometimes, in societies where there is an official intellectual class, it may happen that this class has become insensitive to the impact of changed circum stances on the ordinary man and that it fails to make the necessary adaptation of ideas; in such a case attempts will be made by persons outside the intellectual class to adapt the ideation of the society. There is, of course, no necessity that the attempts to modify and adapt ideas should be successful, whether made by official intellectuals or by others. A process of trial and error, sometimes lengthy, is usually required before a satisfactory modification of ideas is found." Though this was said with reference to the eleventh century, it very neatly characterises 19/20th century Egypt. In fact, it is unlikely that the author did not have this similarity in mind. When he speaks of Ghaz?l? as the systematizer of the ideational basis of the community by smoothing out discrepancies which lead to tensions, either discrepancies originally present or those due to novel circum stances, "adapting it to external changes affecting the community** {Intellec tual, p. 87), the temptation is strong to think of the efforts of Sayyid Ahmad Khan and Muhammad 'Abduh, no matter whether their success can compare with that of Ghaz?l? or not.</page><page sequence="52">268 DETLEV H. KHAHD Gibb Tretids, p. 71, contends that the conservative theologians who know their subject are handicapped by their ignorance of the forces against which they are required to defend their Islam. The average middle-class apologist, on the other hand, "does not really know the Islam which he claims to be defending, and he defends, instead, an imaginative reconstruction on liberal lines which he passionately believes to be the genuine teaching of the Prophet Muhammad." A yet harsher judgment is pronounced on p. 77. 100. See Watt, Theology, p. 176, though there is a special reference to Syed Ameer Ali's The Spirit of Islam, Watt applies his observation universally. Also Colombe, L'?volution, pp. 149-151. Much has been made of the difference in Christian developments, where a determined Protestant Church is said to have saved belief in God by clearly distinguishing between the temporal and the spiritual. On the other hand, there appears an odd resemblance between the above described pro cedure of Muslim modernism and detheologization in Judaism; see Jochanan Bloch, Judentum in der Krise (G?ttingen: 1966), pp. 158-9: "With the passion of rebels we traced out whatever defiance, intrepidity and secret heresy might have been at work in those ancient heroes of the faith, and greedily we put our hand on all that, saying 'this is ours! Thus we really went about with the Bible in our hand: it was the guide, the reader, the diction ary of the generation. But while reading it we were, so to say, leaping, i.e., either we jumped across the name of God or we effaced it. The element of holiness in the book became a sort of holy embarrassment." Cragg, Counsels, p. 15. Al-Ahr?m, March 20, 1959. Other observers have aptly recognized that the political realities complicate every change in this attitude and urge for the restoration of self-esteem before genuine self-knowledge can be attained which is necessary "to remove the intellectual im pediments to a new orientation."

Harris, Nationalism and Revolution, p. 134, has an observation about Egypt's Islamist parties that seems applicable in a much more universal sense: ".. .owing to this undue concentration on the power aspects of Islam's golden age, the Muslim Brothers failed to comprehend the intellectual dimen sions of that era. They did not realize that the receptivity of the earliest Muslim elite to alien thought and learning was one of the golden aspects of the early period of Islamic development..."

Cf. Al-Husry, Three Reformers (Beirut: 1966), p. 135: "The weakness of the Arab world vis-a-vis the West as the more recog nizable defect of their society, and the most painful to bear, for power is one of the basic values of the whole Islamic Weltanschauung. The motive force behind all Arab political thought, from that moment of painful recognition until the present, has been the quest to regain power; or to borrow the sub title of a popular American biography of President N?sir, 'the search for dignity. This, of course, is not true of the Arab intelligentsia alone, but of all Muslim intelligentsias since the nineteenth century, and of the intelligentsias of the presently emerging Afro-Asian nations; as well as of the pre-revolutionary Russian intelligentsia of the past." 107. Smith, Modern History, p. 132. 108. Cragg, Counsels, p. 30. Smith, Modern History, p. 51, observes that the renascense in modern Islam, "more ebullient than thoughtful," set out to recapture vitality rather than redefine "the content or even methods of the faith." 109.

Jinn?b was able to rise to such eminence regardless of his alienation from traditional practice precisely because he was one of the few who fully realized what it was all about and, therefore, could afford to dispense with the cloak of religious gimmicks and the simulations to which others are prone sometimes for reasons of expediency, but often even unwittingly. It is at least doubtful whether his nonconformist style can be interpreted as a basicaUy different outlook. Jinn?b's distinction lies rather in the fact that his intellectual acumen, abetted by the peculiar circumstances of his life, enbaled him to articulate his own true aspirations as the quintes sence of his community's psychological requirements. Jinn?h's seizure of the feeling below the surface reminds of the characteriza tion Smith, Modern History, p. 48, gives of Afgh?n?: ".. .he sensed with a passionate poignancy the plight of his fellow Mus lims, and in his rebounding zest stimulated them to a keen consciousness of their situation and to a determination to redress it." 114. See Cragg, Counsels, p. 189.

The Lebanese historian, Munah ai-Sulh, reproaches alienated intellectuals and insists that Islam,"the property of the masses," provides a natural and mighty support for Arab liberation. A revolutionary power, Islam is "the historic twin" and "a supplementing dimension" of Arabism. See Abdel-Malek, pens?e, p. 230.

It is illuminating to see how much Iqb?l, for instance, was aware of the hampering effect political preoccupation had on the unfolding of theological re thinking. About Afghani he wrote: "If his indefatigable but divided energy could have devoted itself entirely to Islam as a system of human belief and conduct, the world of Islam, intellec tually speaking, would have been on a much more solid ground today." Reconstruction, p. 21. Cf. Smith, Modern History, p. 48. See Gibb, Trends, pp. 32-3: "The protagonists themselves are often not fully clear in their own minds; not only are they liable to be confused by the interaction of currents, issues, and events, but the dominance of the political issue militates against a serious thinking-out of the problems of religion." 123.

Some have seen his greatest merit in the fostering of unity among Egyptian Christians and Muslims. This not with standing, he set a precedent in projecting Islam as a symbol of the East in its confrontation with the Christian West. For Egypt as a country with a Muslim majority, Islam was to help asserting its national identity. Himself not devoutly religious in the orthodox sense, K?mil inveighed both against the westernizer's contemptuous neglect of the Islamic dimension as well as against those moder nists who sought to usher in an enlightenment that might have attenuated the</page><page sequence="55">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 271 implicit emotional attachment of the masses to the Islam that was needed as a national rallying point. See Steppat, K?mil, p. 247 f. On all these scores, K?mil as closely following, whether knowingly or not, the great mentor of nationalists in the Muslim world, Jamal al-D?n al-Af gh?n?. On the basis of Nikki Keddie's profound research on Afghani, one is bound to regard K?mil a 'truer' disciple of the Iranian Sayyid, in his later phase at least, than even *Abduh, not to speak of Rash?d Ri&lt;J?. See Keddi?, Response. That such a 'nationalized' Islam is denuded of much of its primary bearing as a religious quest and, accordingly, detheologized, is further exemplified by his thoroughly utilitarian explanations of not only its role in society, but even of its ritual. See Steppat, K?mil, p. 271. 126. Haim, Arab Nationalism, pp. 9-10: "But it is clear that such a view of the role of Islam in the life of the Muslims is very different from the traditional one. The traditional and orthodox view is that the Muslims are Muslims because they believe in the revelation of God to Muhammad, and because they order their lives according to divine law. They are not Muslims because Islam constitutes a powerful political force which enables men to band together in a strong state and successfully withstand their enemies. Al-Afgh?n?, it can be said, transformed Islam into an ideology which the shrewd statesman can utilize to effect his ends. He was a remarkable man, and we may suspect that he did not advance such views inadvertently or, as it were, unaware. In matters of religion, it would seem, he was a skeptic." 127. Cragg, Counsels, p. 31. 128. Nabih Amin Faris, "The Islamic Community and Communism,." in Laqueur, ed., Transition, p. 357. The special reference is to a very typical example of this trend, - Sayyid Qutb, Al-'ad?laal-ijtim?tiya fil-Isl?m (Cairo: 1950); English trans lation Social Justice in Islam (Washington, D.C. 1953). Cf. Jomier, Islam actuel, pp. 107-8 The ambiguity created by such confusion and pretension has found poignant expression in another Arab scholar's epitomizing of the Islamist stance, i.e., the Muslim who believes Islam to be first and foremost a political panacea. For such believers "the concept of Islam easily tends itself to distension so as to enable the Islamist to outdo all opponents by welcoming every new value discovered as already included within Islam." Ism?'il R?gi al-F?roqi, On Arabism, 'Ur?bah and Religion (Amsterdam: 1962), p. 172. The author elaborates at the instance of Hasan al-Bann?, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood Party, who advised his young partisans to argue with the communists by telling them: "Our principles do more than include yours. You can boast of no principle we cannot match or excel !" The conclusions which such statements induce with critical observers have found succinct evaluation in Cragg, Counsels, p. 106: "So much apology is 'Islam and...

Iqb?l traces a phenomenon back to the 13th century which Charles J. Adams considers as typical of the twentieth: "It is possible also to discern behind this quest for a system a profound, though again perhaps not a conscious perception of the threat to every religious orientation posed by modern thought. Mawdadi talks of a 'system' that his ancestors felt no need of because it is reassuring to do so; the system is a kind of fortress whose intellectual walls will turn aside the arrow of doubt and scep ticism."

See Bernard Lewis, "Communism and Islam," ?in Laqueur, Transition, p. 318: "Many attempts have been made to show that Islam and democracy are identical-attempts usually based on a misunderstanding of Islam or democracy or both. This sort of argument expresses a need of the uprooted Muslim intellec tual who is no longer satisfied with or capable of understanding traditional Isla mic values, and who tries to justify, or rather, re-state, his inherited faith in terms of the fashionable ideology of the day. It is an example of the romantic and apologetic presentation of Islam that is a recognized phase in the reaction of Muslim thought to the impact of the West." 131.

It is a moot question whether Iqb?l, on whom Parwayz depends, was aware of the sociological definition according to which the distinctive trait of religious thought is the distinction between the sacred and the profane. See Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (London: 1915, sixth impression 1968), p. 52. It is, however, striking that Iqb?l and following him Parwayz, mustered all their intellectual arsenal in order to demonstrate that Islam surpasses all religions and world views precisely because it put an end to the division of temporal and spiritual.

Cf. the review of the Egyptian "lay" author M. Kamel Hussein's works in Cragg, Counsels, p. 107.

Muhammad Munir, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, is as authoritative a writer on questions of Muslim thought as he is controversial. He rose to fame especially through his co-authorship of the Report on the Enquiry into the Punjab Disturbances of 1953, dealing with the armed clashes between rival sects and their inability to define who was a Muslim.

Counsels, p. 32. Cragg has taken up the subject under another aspect in Counsels, p. 67, where he elaborates on Lord Cromer's controversial verdict that "Islam reformed is Islam no longer."

The leaders of Islam saw its spiritual foundations endangered by the subtle infidelities of pure rationalism, and although they ultimately triumphed over the Hellenizing school, philosophy always remained an object of suspicion in their eyes, even when it came to be studied merely as an apologetic tool." 160.

Jomier, Islam actuel, pp. 75-6, speaks about the resistance of the*Ulama' to such in teriorization. They see the shadow of Christianity looming large in the contempo rary emphasis on mysticism, and patently accuse the orientalist of wishing to create an Islam that is no more its real self. The fundamental Islamic values, as they perceive them, are sapped by means of devious commentaries. Jomier, in a way, corroborates this by a reference in the same book, p. 200, to the school of orientalists around Massignon who are reproached by their coreligionists for creating something like a new Islam, an idealized Islam which tallies neither with the Islam of the past nor with that of the present.

In this connection he raises the point of genuine Islamicity and advocates SOfism as truly representative of Islam, notwithstanding some Muslim theologians of historical stature who regarded it as a scourge and a tool in the hands of subverters. Cf. Hellmut Ritter, "L'orthodoxie a-t-elle une part dans la decadence?," Ibid. 167 f. Ritter describes as typically Islamic what can, at the most, be said to be typical of a particular trend of SOfism. His is a novel approach insofar as usually the opposite is done, viz., the jurists are wrongly assumed to be genuinely and solely representative of Islam as such, as typifying the true character of this religion. Both approaches with their exclusiveness are prone to be onesided. 164. Berques &amp; Charnay, Normes et valeurs, 222. 165. Speaking about historical relativism as a necessary feature of the incumbent exa mination of the nature of the faith, von Grunebaum quotes a contemporary Indian Muslim thinker of renown in order to illustrate that the concept of an unalterable Islamic structure is becoming untenable: "From time to time it becomes necessary to ask the question: What does Islam stand for ? The answer to this depends upon the time when it is asked, the country in which the answer is ?iven, and the person who proviaes it." From A.A.A.

Cf. Al-J?mVa al-arabtya wa l-wafrda al-'alamiya (Cairo: 1946); quoted by Abdel Malek, pensee, p. 215. The adaptations of this concept to the multifarious exigencies of modern times are indeed a paramount feature of 20th century literature. To quote but a few examples of how the notion of a community of the golden mean resounds, reference is made to Hassan Saab, "The Spirit of Reform in Islam," in Islamic Studies, Vol. 2, No. 1 (March: 1963): "Today, modernity has two poles of power. Both are concerned with social welfare. Yet, one of them pretends to have the real answer to Man's quest for social salvation. Geography and history have placed Islam in the area lying right in between these two poles." (p. 33). "Islam provided, in its early centuries, the creative link between Western monotheism and eastern pantheism. To become today the creative link between them and material monism, it should be able to transform its repetitive mobility of the last centuries into creative and spiritual mobility in freedom, justice and order." (p. 37). Fazlur Rahman, Islam, p. 169, sees this notion continuing through Muslim history: "Wefindlbn Taymiya maintaining that Islam combined the Mosaic law of justice with the Christian law of grace, that it was a middle way between the severity of Moses and the mercy of Christ, and in fine that while Moses had proclaimed God's majesty and Jesus His goodness, Muhammad proclaimed His perfection." How the idea has even been appropriated by Christians for Arab nationa lism shows the example of H.I. Katibah, The New Spirit in Arab Lands (New York: 1940), pp. 257-8: "The 'spiritual pragmatism' which in the last chapter we found to charac terize the Semitic peoples of the Arab lands, also made them the natural media tors between peoples of extreme types of civilization - between the nullifying spirituality of India and the unrelated speculation of Greece. It made of them the interpreters of humanity to humanity, and the world's foremost missionaries. The expression, 'a bridge between three continents,' applied to Syria has been used frequently in a narrow, physical sense. In a deeper sense that country, predominantly, and others of the Fertile Crescent, are a 'spiritual bridge.' The peoples of those lands, fittingly and properly, may be called The Middle Term of Humanity" As instance of a Western orientalist's succumbing to this favourite notion of the modernists is S.D. Goitein, "Islam, the Intermediate Civilization - between Hellenism and Renaissance," in IS; Vol. 2, No. 2 (June: 1963), p. 222: "We have called this civilization Intermediate, because it is intermediate in time between Hellenism and Renaissance, intermediate in character between the largely secular culture of the later Roman period and the thoroughly clerical world of Medieval Europe, and intermediate in space between Europe and Africa</page><page sequence="62">278 DETLEV H. KHALID on the one hand and India and China on the other, thus forming for the first time in history a strong cultural link between all parts of the ancient world." The way this concept is most commonly put to use illustrates A.K. Abdul Mannan, "Balanced Economy of Islam," in The Islamic Literature; Vol. 7, No. 10 (Lahore: October, 1955), p. 6: "The Muslims are called in the Qur'?n the 'Nation of the Middle Path' that chooses the 'Golden Mean.' They have their own way. They are not to cast their lot with any of the conflicting ideologies. In the field of economy they have got their distinctive mode of life. It has synthesized both the ideologies without the evils of either. It steers clear of the difficulties of both and com bines the good points of either." 173. Iqb?l, Reconstruction, p. 167. 174.

An important instance in point is the Ba'th Party ideologist Michel Aflaq. Leonard Binder has lucidly expounded how Islam undergoes a re-evaluation with this Christian Arab nationalist. In fact, Aflaq visualizes Islam in a loftier role than it appears with some Muslim apologists who have a less facile pen. In Aflaq's opi nion "Arab nationalism can bridge the gap to the principles of humanity because it comprehends or is characterised by the universal religion of Islam." Leonard Binder, "Radical Reform Nationalism," p. 108. But here, too, the question is 'which Islam?' Aflaq rejects fundamentalist Islam and omits to mention Islamic political institutions and ideas. His Islam is glorified as having contributed certain values to Arabism, but it has no social ethics and is not in itself a foundation for individual morality. "This Islam is no more than knowledge of the hereafter, the one God, and the notion of individual salvation... the points emphasized are individualism and otherworldliness." Ibid. 108-9. 182.

"In attributing a general spirit of permissiveness to the Qur'?n and Sunna, modern Muslim writers have often been the victims of two alternative but con current tendencies. The first is to carry the argument to the point where Islam</page><page sequence="63">PROBLEM OF DEFINING ISLAM 279 seems to stand for nothing in particular except permissiveness itself. The second is to overlook the substantial renunciation of independence in judgment that is implicit in depending on the Qur'?n and Sunna for authorizations of flexibility." 185.

Fyzee, "Islamic Law and Theology in India - Proposals for a Fresh Approach," in Middle East Journal, Vol. 8, No. 2 (Spring, 1954), p. 179: "It is my thesis that such gradual modifications, even of the rules of SharVa do not destroy the essential truth of the faith of Islam. On a truer and deeper examination of the matter, it will be found that SharVa is only the outer crust which encloses a kernel?the central concept of Islam..." 191. Ibid. 183. 192.

Chartier sees this most recent effort of MahmQd's imperilled because of his radical rejection of historical Islam. He sees little cogency in the renowned Egyptian scholar's endeavour to reconcile two apparently opposite aspirations and arrives at a humanism that is genuinely and specifically Islamic. Cf. Heinz Robert Schiette, Christen als Humanisten (Munich: 1967), p. 15 "Es ist unm?glich geworden, in geschichtlich unvermittelter, esoteri scher Selbstreflektion einen Chrislichen Humanismus aufrechtzuerhalten und anzubieten, denn der neue Humanismus, von dem nicht nur das Konzil, sondern auch die Marxisten, Sozialisten, Positivisten, Liberalisten sowie die Gl?ubigen verschiedener Religionen sprechen und von dem, wie alle erkl?ren, die Zukunft der Menschheit abh?ngt, wird entweder ein allgemeiner, humaner Humanismus sein, oder er wird nicht sein. Als Christen haben wir uns zu fragen, ob der k?nftige Humanismus vielleicht doch auch christliche Z?ge tr?gt, ob wir einen Beitrag zu diesem Humanismus leisten im Stande oder gar verpflichtet sind und worin dieser Beitrag bestehen kann, aber wir k?nnen heute weniger denn je der Menschheit einen 'christlichen Humanismus' als L?sung vors chlagen, der bereits per se eine Desavouierung des humanen Humanismus darstel len w?rde." 193.

See Smith, Modern History, p. 171, n. 13: "However, it would also be possible to argue that a true renascence for Islam would consist in a renewal not of the particular judgments and institu tions of early Muslims, but of their sense of moral imperative, of their over whelming reverence before the 'oughtness' of things. Yet without the supple ment of a discerning intelligence and rational restraint in the implementation of this sense of duty, the dynamist movements show, this too fails." 199 See The Documents of Vatican II (New York: 1967). 200.

A certain caution might be advisable with regard to the author's commitment as a clergyman, but it seems difficult to gloss over his reference to the writings of M.

Counsels, p. 109: "By this movement from what I do to what I am as the gist of sin, the way is ready for an ethical understanding of Islam which, while fulfilling 'law', is yet beyond legalism, and has an inward ally taking God's part against us in the very way that we are for Him. The door is thus opened to a quite new kind of ijtih?d by which the Islamic intention that God should be all in all may be sif ted, energized and fulfilled." 202. See W.M.

Review by Majid|Fakhry of Wilfred Cantwell Smith, Pakistan as an Islamic State (Lahore: 1951), in MET; Vol. 9, No. 3 (Summer, 1955), p. 337. 207. Majid Fakhry (preceding note) refers to the Ahmad?s as a very typical example of such arbitrary interpretation. While it is undeniable that Ahmad? herme neutics stand out for their wilfulness, I should contend that they scarcely put themselves above history. On the contrary, their doctrines of Khil?fat, of econo mics, and their entire 'ultra-orthodox' social practice and minute observance of the ritual, as well as the renewed emphasis on all the other externalities of historical Islam, which puts them on the same footing as their fundamentalist rivals, all this points rather in a direction opposite to that of which Fakhry: is warning. One can hardly go amiss in regarding Ahmad?yat as a caricature of that strong trend in contemporary Muslim thought which is known for raising new horizons lead claims to courageous reforms. Experience has shown that all those demands for to little more but the reenactment of enterprises that have unsuccessfully been tried time and again over many centuries. 208.

Muhammad Ark?n explains how the craving for Islamic specifity is more and more converting into insistence on national individuality. He demonstrates at the ins tance of the three Maghreb states that while each one seeks to grab fragments from the legacy of the universal Muslim community, an exploded myth, they utilize these elements to a contrary purpose by shoring up their national originality and specifity within the pale of Islam and Arab peoples.
