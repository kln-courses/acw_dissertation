ROTARY TOOLS in Ancient Peru By TERENCE GRIEDER TI practical ools are uses generally only, thought but in Precolumbian of as having practical uses only, but in Precolumbian America mechanical devices were en- dowed with symbolic meaning and had ritual as well as practical application. Moreover, the arti- facts produced with these ritual tools took on a similar symbolic importance. Rotary tools and their products are a case in point. In ancient America the simplest rotary tools, the drill and the spindle, were known from a very early time. The more sophisticated lathe and the specialized form of the lathe called a potter's wheel have not been found, and for this reason scholars assumed that the two devices were unknown to the Precolumbian inhabitants of the New World. Recently, however, a group of ceramic and stone funerary vessels discov- ered in the ruins of Pashash in highland Peru indicates that lathes and potter's wheels were known but were limited in their use to the man- ufacture of ritual vessels. Apparently they were never applied to the production of utilitarian objects. At Pashash even the drill was given a specialized ritual use. In addition to solid drill bits employed for cutting parts of ritual vessels, hollow drill bits of unusually large sizes were used to make perfect circles on a number of stone sculptures. Moreover, the fascination with rotary tools led Pashash painters and sculptors to the use of a whirling motif, a variant of the swastika, which is unusual in Precolum- bian art in its expression of dynamic movement. It seems clear that for the ancient people of Pashash advanced rotary techniques had primarily metaphoric rather than economic value. 178</page><page sequence="2">Lathe-made black stone pedestal cup, from the Pashash burial.

Pashash, a ruined town high on the steep western slope of the Andes, adjoins and partly underlies the modern town of Cabana, the capi- tal of the Province of Pallasca in the Depart- ment of Ancash in north-central Peru. The ruins have long been known for their spectacu- lar stone walls, some of whicn are sixteen meters in height. Since 1969 with the permission of the National Institute of Culture of Peru and the support of the University of Texas at Austin, I have been directing excavations at this site. Ten radiocarbon tests indicate that the town was inhabited before a.d. 310 and was aban- doned in the seventh century. Excavations on the top of a precipitous hill called La Capilla revealed the burial of a woman of the ruling class, accompanied by spindle whorls, jewelry and an abundance of ceramic and stone vessels. Most of the objects discussed in this article were gifts or ritual offerings deposited with the body of the dead woman. Two radiocarbon analyses date the interment to the second half of the fifth century. The ceramic and stone cups are of particular interest because they show the marks of the rotary tools used in their manufacture. Cups with low pedestal bases were a common form in both utilitarian and ceremonial wares during this period at Pashash. Like all other Precolum- 179</page><page sequence="3">Bottom of the foot of a stone pedestal cup. Off- center placement of the depression indicates the use of a drill to hollow the foot.

These cups were so soft they could only have been used as offerings to the dead.

The lathe was the major tool used for the production of the stone vessels. The absolute circularity and evenness of these cups could only have been produced with the help of some rotating device, and the hardness of the mate- rial would have necessitated the use of a shaft- centered mechanism, for the stone was simply too hard to be cut effectively on a loose turnta- ble. Furthermore, the regularity of the horizon- tal tool marks shows that the work and not the tool was rotated, an indication of the use of a lathe. The stone would have been attached by the base of the vessel to the shaft, and the hollow of the foot would have had to be drilled out afterwards. The use of both the drill and the lpthe on a single piece was not unusual. A large blue stone spindle whorl from the burial offer- ing has a drilled hole through its center and a curving exterior wall which could only have been made by a tool with a variable radius, such as a lathe. Drills with specialized bits were applied to particular tasks. The hollowing of the feet of the stone cups was accomplished with a drill which left a curving wall and a small central pit, presumably where the shaft rested. The slightly eccentric placement of the depression in the feet of two stone cups likewise indicates the use of a drill, a tool which itself rotated in contrast to a lathe that spun the work. A drill bit which produced a flat circular de- pression around the central pit was used on the bottom of the ceramic cups to cut a socket into which the pedestal foot was set. That the cup and its foot were made separately and then joined is evident in the tendency of the feet to break away from the cups. Among the cups made of clay there are four which were placed in the burial offering without having been fired. As the burial settled one of these vessels lost its foot, revealing a perfectly circular de- pression about three millimeters in depth cut into the base of the cup. A small hole shows where the shaft of the drill was centered. 180</page><page sequence="4">Blue stone with a drilled hole and a lathe-cut exterior.

The most important evidence for the use of rotary tools comes from the ceramic cups found in the burial at Pashash, for it can be demon- strated that they were produced on the potter's wheel, a device so far undiscovered in Pre- columbian America. Steven Howell, a potter at the University of Texas, conducted experi- ments which indicate that the striations appear- ing inside the pedestal feet of the ceramic ves- sels could have been made by a cloth used as a smoothing tool when the soft clay vessels were spun at a moderate speed. 181</page><page sequence="5">Side view of the foot of a ceramic cup showing the tendency of the foot to crack off. Both the foot and the bowl show spin marks on the exterior surfaces. The background color of the painted area also appears to have been applied while the cup was spinning. Diameter of foot, 6.4 centimeters. Simple rotating platforms without center shafts were used to make pottery in many parts of ancient America. The k'abal , a turntable ro- tated with the feet, was used in the Maya area and in Oaxaca a device called a molde , consisting of twin shallow bowls set base to base and spun slowly by hand, was employed. In the Andes nearer to Pashash, craftsmen used th e palala, a flat pottery plate, as a turntable support for pottery making. The handmade utilitarian ves- sels found at Pashash may well have been made on such a support which rotated but lacked a center shaft. The tool marks found on the funerary cups are entirely absent from the utilitarian wares. Although the funerary pottery shares vessel forms with utilitarian wares, it is immediately distinguishable from household ceramics by its structural precision, a feature which it has in common with the stone vessels. This regularity could not have been achieved without a shaft- centered device in rapid rotation, a lathe for the stone vessels, a potter's wheel for the clay ones. Moreover, the brushmarks clearly indicate that even the slipping and painting of the decorative color bands on the pottery cups in the burial were done as the vessels spun. These bands contrast to the more irregular painting found on modeled vessels and other forms not made on rotary tools. The use of rotary tools at Pashash is confined to a period which began in the fifth century and ended before the site was abandoned in the seventh. From the terminal period in the life of the town come hand-carved stone artifacts, such as an irregular green stone cup with a flat base and a face carved in relief on one side. This piece is one of many which show a reversion to manual techniques and a rejection of rotary tools. Since the more advanced rotary devices were used only on ceremonial objects, their re- jection may be understood as the rejection of a system of symbols rather than a casting off of a technology. The rituals which required the use of rotary tools seem to have been the property of an elite group and never to have reached the society as a whole; the folk techniques which survive to this day include neither the potter's wheel nor the lathe. The difference between utilitarian and ceremonial artifacts represents the difference between survival-oriented activities and those directed toward philosophical or artistic expres- 182</page><page sequence="6">Stone relief with a whirling design.

The whirling motif on ceremonial pottery and relief sculpture was a common decorative motif at Pashash during the period when rotary tools were used. The circle and dot appearing in painted examples of the design suggest that the motif was inspired by a rotary device with a central shaft. The freely rotating palala would not have been as likely to have suggested a firm central point to the artist. The motif was not the exclusive property of Pashash, however, for it řs also found as an ornament on the costumes of some Moche chiefs or warriors living on the north coast of Peru within some hundred miles of Pashash. This design is unusual in its dynamism; static figures emphasizing sym- metry are more typical of Precolumbian art. Although one can only surmise the exact sig- nificance which this motif originally conveyed, doubtless it represented the power of rotation. That it also represented the power of rotational tools is unlikely, because such devices were used, like the design, for purely symbolic reasons. At Pashash the design appears for the first time in company with the evidence of rotary tools. The ritual uses of the tools and the appearance of the whirling motif in art emphasize the symbolic importance of the concept of rotation. Whirling designs have a directional motion defined by their arms; the Nazi swastika, for example, is considered to spin clockwise. It stood for forward motion or progress and elic- ited identification from the observer. Direc- tionality may have universal significance based on the dominance of right-handedness. If that is the case, the meaning of the Pashash designs may be understood as the opposite of the Nazi swastika, since all of the painted and carved designs spin counterclockwise. Even the pot- ter's wheels used at Pashash spun to the left, as is evident in the marks the tools left in the clay. The widespread Precolumbian concept of dynamic supernatural guardians of nature who were the antagonists of man may have been symbolized by the Pashash tools and designs, since a left-hand spin implies opposition. 183</page><page sequence="7">Slate ring of unknown use.

Stone "mortar," possibly used as a support for a rotary tool. Height, 12 cm.; diameter 10.2 cm. Some difficult questions still remain to be answered. Archaeology has produced the fruits of Pashash technology but none of its imple- ments. No objects have been found which can be certainly identified as parts of lathes, drills or potter's wheels. The workshop has not been uncovered, but even if it were it is unlikely that any complete tools would be found since the shafts undoubtedly were made of wood, a mate- rial which does not survive for long in the Pashash area. Even the hollow bits of the drills were probably made of reed or bamboo and used with a sand abrasive. Because the tòols had a ritual use, it is conceivable that they, like their products, might have been given as burial offer- ings, as in fact spindle whorls were. Among the various objects from Pashash made of stone, bone, metal and ceramic, there are a number, particularly of stone, whose orig- inal use is uncertain. Several have drill holes and might have been parts of rotary devices, even though they are not usually identified in that way. The largest of these has been called a mortar, but the depression is so regular that it may have been made by a rotating shaft rather than by pounding. Another piece, which has been identified as a clubhead on the basis of 184</page><page sequence="8">various depictions of warriors, could have served as a flywheel. Finally there is a group of small pieces of shale, roughly circular in shape, which are pierced by holes obviously produced by an abrasive rotating bit. The famous Peru- vian archaeologist Julio Tello tentatively iden- tified similar objects at Chavín de Huántar as loom weights, but they might have served as supports for the butts of drill shafts. Simple rotary tools require only a shaft supported at two points and a source of power. A hand-spun drill could have been both powered and sup- ported by the craftsman's two hands. In the case of a lathe or potter's wheel the work cannot support the shaft, so two other points of sup- port, as free of friction as possible, are required. Lacking archaeological evidence, the modern experimenter can only try to imagine the kind of tools the ancient people used to produce the surviving artifacts. In reconstructing such tools, the cultural background of the ancient craftsmen is one of the most important consid- erations. Despite the fact that there is no defi- nite evidence of cord-driven shaft tools in Pre- columbian America, the astonishing variety of uses for fiber and textile products in the An- dean region suggests that the rotary tools used at Pashash may have been driven by hand- operated cords. Besides clothing, the Andean people made bridges, doors, roofs and some architectural ornaments, computers (quipu), weapons for hunting and fighting (the sling and to a lesser extent the bow), mortuary sculpture, basketry and boats of cordage or textile pro- ducts. Experiments show that pulling on a continu- ous cord wrapped around a shaft gives a rapid even rotation, especially if the shaft has a fly- wheel. This method would have been a natural development from the technique used for spinning thread, and it is consistent with the Andean preference for the sling, which spins in a single direction, over the bow. There is no evidence of the reversal of motion in the tool marks on the cups; one would expect to find such traces if the shafts were driven by bows, which spun in alternating directions. It is easier for modern man, with his long tradition of practical tinkering, to understand mere ignorance of simple machines than to ap- preciate their application to exclusively non- utilitarian uses. It strikes him as being sinfully antisocial to use wheels only to make objects to bury with the dead, but that was the typical practice in Precolumbian America. The fact that these attitudes were widely shared makes them no easier to understand, but it does sug- gest that they were less extraordinary than they may seem at first. The best statement of this point of view is found in the Taoist text of Chuang Tzu, which describes a confrontation between a Confucian philosopher and an old man, a Taoist, who was irrigating his garden by climbing in and out of the well with a pitcher. When the philosopher described and recom- mended a well-sweep, the old man laughed scornfully, saying that cunning contrivances led to cunning hearts. The Precolumbian Ameri- cans seem to have shared the Taoist bias against utilitarian machines. The "cunning contri- vance" whose traces are found in the artifacts of Pashash represent a philosophy which con- ceived machines as images of the anti-human and which in the works of life favored simplicity and inborn skill.
