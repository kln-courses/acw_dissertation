<plain_text><page sequence="1">One may take issue with some of Mr Fish's particular readings-his interpre- tation of 'Love III' almost smacks of antinomianism in seeing salvation as some- thing imposed rather than as something freely available to which one is invited- and one may question whether his approach is as all-sufficient as he claims; but there is no doubt that he has written a fascinating book which will enhance our understanding of much religious poetry of the period and certainly adds an important new dimension to our appreciation of George Herbert. C. F. WILLIAMSON The Politics of Landscape: Rural Scenery and Society in English Poetry, x63o-166o. By J. TURNER. Pp. xiv+238. Basil Blackwell: Oxford, 1979. i2z5o net. The concerns of this book carry it beyond its immediate subject-matter. I raise questions of the status of the literary text, of the structure of thought it reveals, and of its relation to class, culture and ideology. These are now hot issues. Structuralism and the renaissance of Marxism have challenged the theoretical feebleness of traditional literary studies, and a gulf has opened up between new theorists and practitioners of the older kinds of literary history, 'background' and the sociology of literature. I try, not to build a bridge, but at least to throw a line across. My conclusion attempts to draw a theory from my practice, and to look at recent critical models of the way literature operates in society. (p. xi) What a pity! The topic given in the title of the book is an important and relatively unstudied one, and ought not to have caused methodological palpita- tions. But what is needed is not only a thorough knowledge of topographia (which ought, however, to extend beyond topographical poems to include that great volume of topographical guides and impressions which had become an important genre in England since the Reformation and in which Dr Turner shows no interest-he does not appear to have used even Leland or Camden), but also a reasonable knowledge of English social history, and a general know- ledge of English intellectual history, of which these poems form one tiny part. The author is right when he says that his poets saw the landscape as a reflection of the human world, but they did not do so for the anachronistic reasons favoured in his commentary, but because their theological understanding of the harmony of the divine, the natural and the human worlds made such an equation a com- monplace. Seventeenth-century man's attitude to nature was fundamentally anthropomorphic. God had created nature to be exploited by man, to serve his needs, to teach him lessons. The century in fact witnessed, as Keith Thomas has recently argued, crucial changes of perception, with a more empirical and secular attitude-and a greater sense of man's responsibility for, and stewardship of, the natural world. None of this is perceived by Dr Turner. His book is, in short, myopic and under-researched. It falls into six chapters. The first discusses ideal forms of landscape in the art and poetry of the period; the second establishes the social and intellectual 466 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">applications of this ideal; the third takes Denham's Cooper's Hill and Marvell's Upon Appleton House as examples of the genre; the fourth looks at the common ground between topographia and political theory (though the footnotes show little knowledge of political thinkers of the period other than Harrington); the fifth purports to show how the political ideals derived from such topographia involved sharp criticism of existing economic values and institutions; and the sixth shows how the ideal world of the topoi was incompatible with existing social structures: 'landscape becomes a defence against the violent world of men.' Yet Dr Turner's view of seventeenth-century England as one in which 'property was the sole basis of identity', in which 'the I63os and I64os were dominated by fear of class war', and in which 'the interests of rich and poor are fundamentally opposed' is not one which any recent historians would accept, certainly not the ones he cites. The only seventeenth-century witnesses he calls are the Diggers, noble and moving in their writings, but hopelessly unrepresentative (and amongst those least likely to be in communion with Dr Turner's poets). It is also regret- table to find a doctor of philosophy in English using such feeble phrases as 'the image is all the more stupendous ...' (p. 29), or [villains had] 'crucified the country with civil war' (p. 40). J. S. MORRILL The Ornament of Action: Text and Performance in Restoration Comedy. By PETER HOLLAND. Pp. xiv+284. Cambridge: University Press, I979. ?12-50 net. In this handsomely produced book, Mr Holland provides remarkably com- prehensive and concise accounts of the organization of Restoration theatrical companies, their stars and supporting players, the practices of type-casting-and the casting against type, that doubtless were as crucial to the contemporary impact of these plays as they were to the films produced in the heyday of the Hollywood studios. Should scholars suddenly unearth a comparable wealth of information concerning the staging of Elizabethan plays, their discovery would be hailed with hosannas, and certainly followed with a legion of books and articles discussing its relevance to our critical understanding of the texts. Never- theless, as Mr Holland observes, critics of Restoration drama have, for the most part, tended to ignore all such information. Their primary concerns have been the immorality, amorality, or morality, the triviality, profanity, or profundity, of the plays involved. The reason for this preoccupation is historical. In arguments derived from Plato's attacks on poetry and drama in The Republic, Jeremy Collier attacked the drama of his own age because it evoked undue admiration for, and thus encou- raged emulation of, its unworthy characters, treated religion flippantly, etc. And the (essentially Platonic) premisses of Collier's attack have themselves dictated the counter-arguments on which the case for the defence of Restoration comedy traditionally rests: in article after article, book after book, critics have insisted that these plays instruct us, by negative example, to eschew (not to emulate) the vices and follies portrayed; that their religious references are profound, not profane, and so on. This is why most critical discussions of this drama, from the REVIEWS 467</page></plain_text>
