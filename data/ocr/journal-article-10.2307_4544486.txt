<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 21, Bedford Square, London, W.C.I, on June 4th, 1951, at 7.30 p.m. XI.-TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. By JONATHAN COHEN. MY reason for reopening discussion of teleological explanation is that I do not know of any treatment of the subject which does not seem to be an oversimplification in at least some important respects. I hope that my own mistakes in this direction will at least be new ones. I am not using " teleological " in the narrow sense in which it was introduced into the vocabulary of philosophers by Christian Wolff through the publication of his Logic in 1728. Wolff coined the term to denote the " very large and highly useful part of natural science which unfolds the ends of things ". But I shall use it in the wider sense which has now developed. I shall call a sentence " teleological " if it includes, or can be paraphrased by a sentence which includes, the English conjunctive phrase " in order to " (or an inter-translatable phrase in other languages). The following therefore are all teleological sentences: " God instituted marriage in order to provide for the procreation of children ", " The policeman held up his hand in order to stop the traffic ", " A dog's heart beats in order to keep its blood in circulation ", etc., etc. Despite their grammatical similarity there is a considerable range of logical diversity in the usage of these sentences. So that the problem of teleology can be viewed by those who find it illuminating to do so as a typically philosophical perplexity, arising from an asymmetry between grammar and logic. But I wish to concentrate on discussing the logical form of those usages of teleological sentences which assert explanations. I shall begin (I) by proposing one criterion by which to judge of any sentence-usage whether it may be labelled " explanatory ". I shall discuss briefly the respective merits of this criterion and some others for determining the extent z</page><page sequence="2">256 JONATHAN COHEN. to which the logical category of explanation overlaps with what is (according to my definition) the grammatical cross-section of teleology. I shall then try to point out (II) certain stock misconceptions of the ways in which teleological sentences can be used for the assertion of explanations. And I shall conclude (III) by expanding my own account of these usages. I shall not concern myself with the use of teleological sentences for ends other than explanation, such as the assertion of " I shall go to Glenshee to buy a hat " as the announcement of a purpose or a plan, though some of what I say may be relevant to the analysis of these usages. I. I propose to consider that a sentence is used to assert an explanation of a fact (or class of facts) if and only if both of the following two conditions are satisfied:- (a) The explanans which the sentence is used to assert is a fact that both constitutes a reason for accepting or expecting the explanandum. and also can in principle be verified by standard empirical methods. (b) The assertion would not uncommonly be regarded as an at least appropriate answer to the question " why" the explananduxn is the case. I am not trying to describe how the term " explanation" has in fact been used, nor recomnmending how it should be used. Instead I am stipulating the sense of the term. in which I am here interested. Condition (b) without condition (a) would afford an inadequate criterion of this sense, because I am not concerning myself with the logic of religion, for instance, or mythology. And (a) without (b) would be inadequate since I do not wish to discuss evidential assertions like " He passed his examination because he is looking pleased " which would be an appropriate answer to " M hy do you believe he passed his examination ? " but not to "Why did he pass his examination ? " Thus my sense of' "explanation " is both narrower than some, and wider than</page><page sequence="3">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 257 other, senses in which the applicability of teleology to explanation has often been discussed. I shall consider four of these senses. 1. I do not intend in this paper to discuss the syntax or prgamatics of assertions which cannot be tested for truth by reference to universally agreed standards. It has been the use of teleological sentences to make assertions of this type, such as " God instituted marriage in order to provide for the procreation of children ", which has chiefly served to bring teleology into disrepute outside religious circles. Such assertions are in fact often called " explanations ", and it might be thought that this title is justified by their providing recognisably appropriate answers to a notoriously common form of " Why . . . ?" question (most recently discussed, under the name of "limiting question ", by Mr. S. Toulmin'). But whatever they be called no statements of this type can hope in the forseeable future to provide universally acceptable reasons for expecting anything. And since I think that there is much naturalistic teleological explanation which is worth investigating I have deliberately designed my working definition of " explanation " to exclude paying any attention to the more dubious occupations of teleological sentences. 2. There is no advantage here in using " explanation" in such a way that only the statement of logically sufficient reasons for accepting or expecting a fact can be an explana- tion of it. By " stating logically sufficient reasons for accepting or expecting a fact " I mean asserting a statement which entails the statement of the fact in question. An example of such a logically complete explanation would be to account for an apple's fall by saying " The apple was ripe, the tree was shaken, and when an apple-tree is shaken ripe apples fall." And even " The apple was ripe and the tree was shaken " would be an imnplicitly complete explanans. But logically incomplete explanations can afford some degree of intellectual satisfaction. They can also help The Place of Reason in Ethics, 1950, p. 204 ff. Z 2</page><page sequence="4">258 JONATHAN COHEN. us to a partial control of events. And it is therefore often more useful to have a partial explanation than no explanation at all. If someone says " She slammed the door because she was in an angry mood ", leaving unstated why the lady's anger took the particular form it did he has given us some reason for expecting she would slam the door but not (as I shall try to show more clearly below) a logically sufficient reason. He has made an assertion which would entail the explanandum if and only if he included in it one or more other propositions (such as " she was leaving the room and she always slams the door when she leaves a room in anger ") that are not themselves sufficient to entail the explanan- dum. There are, of course, other senses in which explanations are sometimes labelled " complete " or " incomplete ". Any scientific explanation might be called " incomplete " if it does not subsume the explanandum under a unified system of hypotheses which emnbraces all hitherto observed facts, and any naturalistic explanation whatever might be called "incomplete " by a religiously-minded person. In the foreseeable future, however, it seems unlikely either that any scientifically complete explanation of the former type will be attainable, though some may be more complete than others, or that any religious cosmology will be universally accepted. And it is particularly important to distinguish between logically complete and logically incomplete ex- planations in connection with teleology. It is seriously misleading to confine the title " explanation " to statements of logically sufficient reasons for expecting the explanandum, because one mnajor form of teleological explanation is always logically incomplete, as I shall try to show. To insist on the necessity for logical completeness in explanations is to rule out at the start the very possibility of teleological explanations in terms of human purposes. It expels from the category of explanation even those assertions which are generally recognised as belonging to it such as " It was in order to stop the traffic that the policeman held up his hand ".</page><page sequence="5">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 259 3. There is a not unusual sense of " explanation " in which to call an assertion an explanation is not merely to record an endeavour but also to claim an achievement. In this sense an explanation must be a true statement entailing the statement of the explanandum either by itself or in conjunction with one or more other propositions which also happen to be true (and are not themselves sufficient to entail it). It is futile then to ask of an explanation " Is it true or false? " because " false explanation " becomes a contra- diction. Instead, if someone has doubts about the truth of what is claimed to be an explanation he must ask " Is it an explanation at all? " There are analogous senses of " description ", " prediction ", " deduction " and perhaps other terms in pragmatics. And these differentiate them fromterms like " proposition "," generalisation ", " theorem " " hypothesis " and " evaluation " which are seldomn, if ever, used in this way. However, words of the former class, such as " explanation " and " description ", are also often used like those of the latter in such a way that it does make sense to ask of what they are used to denote " True or false ? " It is thus that I am using " explanation ", since it enables me to discuss whether assertions of a given type constitute explanations without reference to whether they are true or false. Otherwise, I should have to phrase my problem hypothetically and not categorically, viz., " if an assertion like this were true, would it constitute an -explanation ? " 4. There is a further common sense of " explanation with which I am not directly concerned. An utterance is often called an " explanation " by someone if and only if he accepts as true its statement of reasons, sufficient or insufficient, for expecting the explanandum (or even, if and only if it causes him not to feel surprise at the explanandum) In this sense what is an explanation for one person may be none at all for another, since its achievement in this direction will vary in accordance with the factual beliefs (or even with the emotional make-up and current feelings) of those interested. I am disregarding this sense of " explanation ", because I wish to discuss the extent to which the grammatical z 3</page><page sequence="6">260 JONATHAN COHEN. cross-section of teleology overlaps with the logical, not the psychological, category of explanation. I have made instead the reservation that it should in principle be possible for anyone to test the factuality of the explanans. IT I shall pass now to a review of some of the common muddles about teleological explanation. I shall consider them in three groups: (1) mnuddles involving a narrower definition of " explanation " than mine, (2) muddles arising from attempts to treat all teleological explanations as being of the samne logical type, and (3) muddles inherent in regarding teleology and mechanismn as the twin species of explanation. 1. Procrustean theories of explanation.-A number of mis- conceptions of the ways in which teleological sentences can be used for the assertion of explanations arise from trying to compress the analysis of teleological explanations so as to fit into the Procrustean bed of an over-narrow definition of " explanation Mr. C. J. Ducasse2, for instance, held that " explanation essentially consists in the offering of a hypothesis of fact, standing to the fact to be explained as case of antecedent to case of consequent of some already known law of con- nection ". Accordingly, he believed that " no explanation is possible under a law of the ' Only if x, y type ', which informs us of that in the absence of which y does not occur, instead of . . . informing us of that in the presence of which y does occur." On his view a biological sentence like "My dog's heart beats in order to keep its blood in circulation " (i) cannot be used by itself as an explanation because the alleged explanans is not a sufficient condition of the explanandum but contingent upon it. And he considers that the only way 2 In " Explanation, Merchanism and Teleology ", reprinted from The Journal of Philosophy, 23, 1926, in Readings in Philosophical Analysis, ed. H. Feigl and W. Sellars, 1949, p. 540 if.</page><page sequence="7">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 261 in which such a sentence could be used in an explanation is if it had reference to the purpose of an agent. A sentence of the form " x in order toy " cannot be an explanation of the occurrence of x under the law that " Only if x, y ". Instead, if it is to b ean explanation at all, it must have reference to another law, viz., the law that " If an agent believes thaty is contingent upon x and desiresy, then that agent is likely to do x." But in the case of sentences like (i) such a reference is open to the objection that there is no universally admissible evidence for the existence of the agent-a Designer of animal structures-or of his purpose. So that on Mr. Ducasse's view, as on Bacon's3, there is no respectable use of teleological sentences for biological explanation. Mr. Ducasse holds that (i) states the explanandum to be a necessary condition of something which cannot be an explanans unless it is the purpose of an agent. Now when a teleological sentence is used for biological explanation, the explanandum is asserted to be a necessary condition of the explanans and thereby also of the persistence under varying circumstances of a whole of which both explanans and explanandum are facts. But this explanans need not be a purpose. A man is given an adequate reason to expect his dog's heart to beat, for instance, if he is told that its blood is in constant circulation and can only be so as long as its heart continues to beat, and also that the blood must continue to circulate if the dog is to remain alive. He has been told the vital function of his dog's heart-beats. And he has thus been given a logically complete explanation of that phenomenon without reference to any human or super- human agent. I shall have more to say later about this type of teleological assertion. But it should be clear that it is only the narrowness with which Mr. Ducasse defines " explanation " that forces him to regard such assertions as invoking the activity of some personal agent if they are to be explanations at all. Mr. Ducasse recognises only the 3 Novum Organum, ii. 2. Z 4</page><page sequence="8">262 JONATHAN COHEN. ordinary type of causal explanation, where some event or process is explained by reference to the occurrence of what is alleged to be its causally sufficient condition. And in view of the frequency with which teleological sentences are used for the assertion of functional explanations in agnostic literature, in elementary text-books of medicine, say, I think that this identification of " explanation " with " causal explanation " is misleadingly eccentric. I think that another over-narrow definition of " explana- tion " is probably an important source of the attempt to assimilate or " reduce " the commonest form of teleological explanation-the explanation of an agent's conduct in terms of his purposes-to a type of " causal" explanation. Mr. R. B. Braithwaite,4 for instance, has claimed that an explanation like " I travelled up to-day . . . to address the Aristotelian Society " is " an explanation of the ordinary causal sort with my intention as cause preceding my journey as effect." In his view " teleological explanations of intentional goal-directed activities are always understood as reducible to causal explanations with intentions as causes ". Another version of the same reductive analysis of purposive explanation was offered by Mr. Ducasse.5 In Mr. Ducasse's view an assertion of the form " a did x in order toy " amounts to the threefold statement: (1) that a believed in a law either of the " If x,y " type or of the " Only if x,y " type, (2) that a " desired " the occurrence ofy, and (3) that a's performance of x was caused by that belief and that desire jointly. Neither Mr. Braithwaite nor Mr. Ducasse have indicated how they think the existence of these causal relations can be estab- lished. But Mr. G. A. Lundberg6 has supplied a theory on the subject which is thoroughly in keeping with Mr. Braithwaite's claim that these are " ordinary" causal relations. On Mr. Lundberg's view, " when a person murders his grandmother who happens to hold (' because she holds ') a large insurance policy in favour of the 4 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, xlvii (1946-7), p. iii. 6 Op. cit., p. 543. 6 Foundations of Sociology, 1939, p. 222.</page><page sequence="9">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 263 murderer, the latter is assigned as the motive purely on the basis of the frequent recurrence of this and similar com- ponents in such situations ". 1 shall now try to show that this causal analysis of purposive explanations is untenable, and shall go on to discuss one probable source of the error. I do not think that the frequent recurrence of similar situations is the only basis for asserting " The accused killed his grandrnother in order to cash the large insurance policy which she held in his favour." Sherlock Holmes was very fond of referring to previous cases. But it is unlikely that prosecuting counsel at a murder trial would make any reference at all to the circumstances of other murders. He need only show that the accused believed his grandmother's death would result in his receiving a large sum from the insurance company, and that at the time he intended to get hold of this money rather than to achieve any other result of her death which he might foresee. Similarly, I do not need to study the relationships of Mr. Braithwaite's other intentions to his other journeys in order to establish that he travelled up to London on November 4, 1946, in order to address the Aristotelian Society. All that requires to be shown is that he believed he could not speak to the Aristotelian Society unless he camne up to London, and that at the time he gave priority to his intention to address the Society over all other intentions which could not be fulfilled without his coming up to London. Both these accounts of what is involved in establishing purposive explanations, which I shall defend in detail later on (in III), bear some resemblance to Mr. Ducasse's scheme. They both mention a belief in a law, of the " If x, y " type in one case, and of the " Only if x, y " type in the other. They both refer also to what might loosely be termed a " desire " of y. But in both cases this " desire " is of a peculiarly complex type, involving a system of priorities with regard to a specified range of possible objectives; and Mr. Ducasse failed to recognise this complexity. And in both cases the explanans cited is rather a conjunction of z5</page><page sequence="10">264 JONATHAN COHEN. complex dispositions of which the explanandum is an actualisation than a cause of which it is an effect. Mr. Ducasse7 seems to have held that "If an agent believes that y is contingent upon x and desires y, then that agent is likely to do x " (ii) is a law of causal connection to which reference is made in every purposive explanation. If he was correct in this, purposive explanations might indeed be reducible to ordinary causal explanations. But I think I can show that in the sense in which (ii) might be a law of causal connection it is false, and that in the two main senses in which (ii) is true it is not a law of causal connection but trivial and analytic. The " desire " in question might be just one of the hundred and one desires that we all have all the time, which we frequently do not intend to do anything to achieve, desires for enjoyments or for good behaviour, for necessities or for luxuries, like my desire for a private helicopter. In that case (ii) is falsified by the facts. My being able to satisfy my desire for a private helicopter is contingent upon my devoting my time and energy to more profitable sources of money-making than teaching philo- sophy; and I see no indication of any likelihood that I shall do this. I have other desires which conflict with it. Mr. Ducasse might therefore claim that " he is likely to do x " means " if x is in his power, and if he has no conflicting desires, he will probably do x ". I should admit that in this sense (ii) is true. But it needs no observation to establish this truth. It is merely part of what is ordinarily meant by " desire ". It may be grammatical to say " I desire to own a helicopter, it is in my power to buy one now, I have no desires that conflict with acquiring such a posses- sion, but it is improbable that I shall acquire one now." But this utterance would normally be regarded as morbidly inconsistent. It would only be clearly self-consistent if " I desire x" meant no more than " I enjoy day-dreaming about x ". And the meaning of the latter proposition, though perhaps part, is certainly not the whole of the normal 7 Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 265 meaning of " I desire x ". It is only because a desire for x necessarily goes beyond the enjoymnent of day-dreams about x that it is always in point to ask about a desire whether it has been, is being, or will be satisfied. Satisfiability in principle is a necessary feature of all desires, though the satisfaction of some may be impossible in practice. Accord- ingly, a desire of x entails a tendency to effect x under certain conditions. And (ii), in the sense of " he is likely to do x " in which it is true, is not a causal law but an elucidation of the meaning of " desire " in this respect. On the other hand, Mr. Ducasse might have claimed that in (ii) the word " desires " does not refer to just any one of the hundred and one desires that we all have all the time, but only to an attitude of the agent which is of such a sort that he is in fact likely to do what will satisfy this " desire ". The word would then be used in an unusually narrow sense to connote a desire which prevails over all conflicting wants and intentions. But to say that someone's desire fory prevails over all conflicting wants and intentions is not to say something related to the likelihood of his satisfying this desire in the same way as an admiral's victory in a naval engagement xnight be related to the likelihood of his being knighted. The likelihood of his satisfying the desire is not the causal outcome of a victorious struggle, but a pivotal feature of the victory. " His desire for y prevails over all conflicting wants and intentions " necessarily implies " He is more likely to satisfy this desire, if it is in his power, than any that conflict with it." The former of these two propositions may imply other things also, in particular that he enjoys day-dreaming abouty more than about anything else conflicting with it. But this is not in practice its most important implication. If it were, there need be no operative difference in this crucial respect between his attitude of mind and ;mine if I enjoyed day-dreaming about possessing a private helicopter more than about anything else, though my desire for such a possession never prevails over any of my other desires. What differentiates his desire from mine is that his actually prevails-he is really likely</page><page sequence="12">266 JONATHAN COHEN. to satisfy it. So that in this special sense of " desire " in which (ii) is true it is not like " If an apple tree is shaken, ripe apples will fall " but rather like " If a substance is fragile, it is likely to break ". To hold that in this sense (ii) is a law of causal connection is as absurd as holding that likelihood of breakage is caused by fragility. Mr. Braithwaite's view seems to suggest that not (ii) but "If an agent believes that y is contingent upon x and intendsy, then that agent is likely to do x " (iii) is the relevant causal law. But it could be shown in a fashion roughly analogous to my treatment of (ii) that (iii) too is not a law of causal connection. I shall not repeat the details but simply outline the three corresponding cases. In the ordinary sense of " intention " (iii) is false, because many people, especially those with weak wills or fickle characters, often change their intentions. So that (iii) can only be true for special senses of either " he is likely to do x" or of " intention." " He is likely to do x" might mean " If x is in his power and if he does not change his mind he will probably do x." In that case (iii) would be analytic because " intention " always refers to a tendency to act in one way or another and not merely to think about so acting. Whatever the practical difficulty in achieving our intentions, it is always in point to ask whether they have been, are being, or will be achieved. " Intention " might connote a firm and unyielding resolution. In that case also (iii) would be analytic because the firmness of an intention is related to the likelihood of its achievement rather as the pliability of a bow to the likelihood of its being bent than as the boldness of an admiral to the likelihood of his sinking the enemy. It is not a cause, but a logically necessary condition. Another attempt to show that purpose-explanations are a form of causal explanation has been made by Professor C. A. Mace8. He holds that " a causal sequence assumes 8 Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume, xiv, 1935, p. 22 ff. (excerpted and reprinted in Readings in Philosophical Analysis, p. 534).</page><page sequence="13">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 267 . . . a teleological character whenever a sequence of events occurs which satisfies certain conditions, viz.: (1) that for the sequence in question there is a possible state of affairs, E, such that its introduction at any stage terminates the process; (2) that phases which promote E are repeated or continued whilst those that are adverse to E are discon- tinued; (3) that with repetition the process approximates to a form in which every phase is relevant to the production of E." Now it is true that the failure of our plans often leads us to correct the beliefs on which they were based. And Professor Mace's definition of " teleological sequence " might therefore be useful as a criterion for judging the extent to which rats in mazes, say, exhibit purposive forms of activity. But it is inadequate as an analysis of purposive explanation. On Professor Mace's view we need to observe many successive instances of a sequence before establishing its teleological character. But a lawyer is regarded as being able to establish, for instance, that a murder was deliberately planned for a certain purpose even though the murderer had never done anything like it before. I conclude that it is an error to assimilate purposive explanations to " ordinary causal " ones.9 And I think that one of the main sources of this erroc (though not the only one) is the conjunction of a desire to exhibit such assertions as explanations with a reluctance to admit the possibility of any logical incompleteness in statements belonging to that category. If I am right, purpose-explanations are dis- positional explanations and I shall try to show that dispositional explanations are necessarily inferior in respect of logical completeness to ordinary causal ones. Whenever ordinary causal explanations, as actually uttered, are logically incomplete, there ought never to be any difficulty in completing them. If a generalised hypo- thetical proposition is cited as the explanans, then what is 9 My conclusion here does not entail any prediction about the extent to which connections may be traced between molar laws of human behaviour and molecular laws of physiology: I am not, for instance, subscribing to the view that "no translation is possible from 'cause language' into 'motive language' " as expressed by Mr. A. Flew in Analysis, October, 1949, p. 13.</page><page sequence="14">268 JONATHAN COHEN. being claimed obviously includes the fulfilment of this hypothetical in the case in question. If someone says " The apple fell because ripe apples always fall when apple-trees are shaken ", for instance, it is child's play to add " The apple was ripe and the tree was shaken." And, conversely, if he had said " The apple fell because it was ripe and the tree was shaken," there would be no difficulty in supplying the hypothetical of which the assertion seems to be implicit in the claim that this is an explanation. If an explanation cannot be completed with true propositions as easily as this, it cannot be regarded as an acceptable causal explanation, or, by Mr. Ducasse's definition of " explanation ", as any explanation at all. But a dispositional explanation cannot be completed as easily as this. Take, for instance, the assertion " She slammed the door because she was in an angry mood." It would not be in any way absurd to complete it on the model of a causal explanation. We could quite intelligibly remark " She slammed the door because she was in an angry mood and when she is in an angry mood she always slams doors." But in most cases this added hypothetical would be false. People who always slam a door each time they are angry are fortunately few and far between. Yet when one of the great majority does slam a door in anger it nevertheless seems a true explanation of the action to assert " She slammed it because she was in an angry mood ". And that is the main reason why we cannot class such dispositional explanations with ordinary causal ones10. If we wish to comnplete them as true explanations, we must do so on a more ample model. We must add at least one other protasis to the hypothetical and assert its 10 It is sometimes suggested that the main reason for this is that the explanans of a dispositional explanation is a fact about a specific individual, and does not include, like a causal explanans, a law about a class of individuals. But I think it is always possible to unpack a law from a dispositional explanans, as I try to illustrate in my text. As I am not concerning myself with the psychological sense of " explanation " my view here is not affected by Professor G. Ryle's theory (Concept of Mind, p. 124) about the relative dates at which we learn of the relevant dispositions and laws, respectively. On the view I am suggesting it could be argued that the difference between causal and dis- positional explanations is one of degree rather than of kind, lying in the extent to which the explanatory law requires qualification.</page><page sequence="15">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 269 fulfilment. We must say, for instance, " She slammed it because she was in an angry mood and was leaving the room, and if someone of her type is in an angry mood and leaves the room she always slams the door ". And thus dispositional explanations are necessarily inferior to ordinary causal explanations in regard to logical completeness because their logical completion requires more extensive additions. So that, if anyone wished to make out that teleological sentences were used to assert logically complete explanations of human conduct by reference to human purposes, he might well be reluctant to do it by treating them as dispositional explanations. Indeed, he would most naturally seek to assimilate this usage to ordinary causal explanation, because the latter is so obviously a paragon of logical completeness. But this is wishful thinking. Even if you would like your bicycle to be a helicopter you will not fly over the house-tops by pretending that it is one. 2. Confounding of functional and purposive explanation.-I have now mentioned two different types of teleological explanation, viz., the use of teleological sentences for the assertion of functional and purposive explanations, respec- tively. Various misconceptions of these usages have sometimes arisen from confusing them together in one way or another, and in particular from thinking that teleological explanations are (1) all functional, or (2) all purposive. Mr. Eugenio Rignano11, for instance, set out " to define Finalism in such a way as to remove from the definition every suspicion of anthropomorphism and at the same time to include in it all living processes.... The main point is that this definition should include, as a particular case, the conscious acts of man, which alone fall under Aristotle's restricted definition." Mr. Rignano held that " when external circumstances change for an organism the reaction processes produced by the change of circumstances also change, but . . . the final result of these processes, however different they may be as compared with one another, always " Mind, 1931, p. 335 ff. A very similar theory was asserted by L. T. Hobhouse, Development and Purpose, 1913, p. 317.</page><page sequence="16">270 JONATHAN COHEN. remains the same." But this, he pointed out, is not the case with natural inorganic processes like the melting of a glacier or the fall of an avalanche. " We therefore have here a general distinctive characteristic, entirely objective, and in no respect subjective or anthropomorphic, which enables us to divide the whole of the processes of the external world into two great categories-the teleological and the ateleological." The finalist nature of the former "is determined . . . simply and solely by the invariance of the final result to which they normally lead by their reacting, with self-modification, to changed circumstances." I shall try to show that this kind of theory is unsatis- factory. Mr. Braithwaite"2 elaborated a theory like this with regard to functional explanations, agreeing with Dr. E. S. Russell that what is distinctive of the organic processes so explicable is that they are cases of persistence towards the same goal under varying conditions. I have no serious quarrel with such an account of functional teleology, since my own view of it is very similar. The difference between such an account and mine is that I think it better to avoid any suggestion of temnporal reference in stating the logical form of functional teleology. This type of explanation seems often to be applied where the explanans is simultaneous with, and not subsequent to, the explanandum in the way that, for instance, the circulation of the blood is simultaneous with the beating of the heart. I have accordingly omitted any word like " goal " from my account of functional explana- tion, because I have tried to use terms which are temporally quite neutral in this respect. My view is sinply that the explanandum is asserted to be a necessary condition of the explanans and thereby also of the persistence under varying circumstances of a whole of which both explanans and lexpananduxn are parts. But it is confusing to try to subsume purposive explana- tions also under this head as did Mr. Rignano. He instanced the " purpose " of a man in wearing heavy clothes in winter 12 Loc. cit., p. viii ff.</page><page sequence="17">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 271 and light in summer, and the " purpose " of a businessman's taking this or that action " with the same single result, an increase in his income." It may well be true that the function (in the sense of " function " defined above) of wearing heavy or light clothes, as the case may be, is to protect a man's health in the prevailing weather-conditions, and that the function of a businessman's actions is to increase his income. But this would not be incompatible with asserting that the purposes of such conduct in any particular case were quite different. My uncle George, for instance, wears heavy clothes in winter and light in summer in order to please his tailor, for whom he has a great regard. And his business transactions are all designed to increase the total volume of British exports. It is true also that his health and incomne would suffer if his sartorial habits and business transactions, respectively, were other than they actually are. The same is true of my uncle Claud, who dresses himself heavily in winter and lightly in summer in order not to appear conspicuous, and deliberately plans his business so as to increase production. In these respects the purposes of George and Claud's conduct vary irrespectively of its functions, so that it is not necessary to identify the former with the latter. And this is hardly surprising because the explanans of a purpose-explanation is a conjunction of dispositions attributed to the performer of the explanandum, whereas a functional explanation cites a process or event of which the explanandum is asserted to be a necessary condition. Hence, if " George is wearing heavy clothes in order to protect his health " is asserted as a functional explanation and " George is wearing heavy clothes in order to please his tailor" as a purposive explanation, both assertions may be true. The two explanations are logically independent of each other. Only if both sentences were used to assert explanations of the same type would there be any possibility of conflict between the two assertions. But in practice it is common to interpret the use of all teleological sentences which concern the conduct of a person as if it involved the assertion of purposive explanations, not</page><page sequence="18">272 JONATHAN COHEN. functional ones, and for the analysis of these assertions Mr. Rignano's definition of " finalisxn " is irrelevant. The opposite mnistake to Mr. Rignano's is made by those philosophers who treat all teleological explanations as if it were concerned in one way or another with purposes. It is a historical truism that the use of teleological sentences for the assertion of functional explanations has developed out of their use in purposive explanations. Purposive explanations are so useful for understanding the behaviour of one's fellow-men that primnitive minds are easily tempted to extend their scope to embrace non-human behaviour by imnagining the organic and inorganic world to be peopled with myriads of non-human minds. But, when the animist outlook of primitive superstition gives way via polytheismn to monotheistic religion, the use of teleological sentences to explain events which are not deliberately planned by human beings ceases to resemble the purposive explanation of human conduct in its logical form. A man or a river-god might without impiety be expected to plan his activity in accordance with his beliefs about the world. Mere mortals or river-gods must learn about the hard unalterable facts of life in order to arrange their conduct accordingly. But for an omnnipotent God there can be no hard unalterable facts. And it is therefore odd to conceive of an omnipotent God as planning His activity in accordance with His factual beliefs. Whatever the logical pattern of theistic teleology-the use of teleological sentences for the assertion of theistic doctrine-it can hardly be the same as that of purposive explanation. And this difference can be recognised by anyone, whatever his attitude to the theories of Spinoza, Hume or more orthodox theologians. Mono- theists may aim at purposive explanations of natural phenomena, but they are xnore likely to produce something which is either not monotheistic or not a purposive explana- tion. And as I know of no empirical standards for testing the truth of what they do produce I shall not spend any time here on the analysis of this theistic teleology which is excluded by my definition of " explanation ".</page><page sequence="19">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 273 The progress of human science, however, has been accompanied by the development of wholly naturalistic forms of explanation. And it is not difficult to see how the same sentence that was originally used for the assertion of religious doctrine can come to be used for the statement of a functional explanation. If someone asserts a sentence of the form " God has arranged that x in order toy," we can in one way treat his assertion as partly verifiable by reference to religious revelation. We can find out for ourselves whether x andy are the case (if they are observable facts) and appeal to revelation in order to discover whether, say (whatever this means), God intended x for the sake ofy and not for the sake of something else. Or, alternatively we can satisfy ourselves with finding out whether x andy exist and if x is a necessary or sufficient condition ofy and regard the prefix " God has arranged that . . . " as expressing a general acknowledgemnent of God's supremacy in the universe. And if we do this we shall be treating the assertion as a more naturalistic explanation while main- taining conventional forms of piety. Finally, in an age when these conventions have ceased to be de rigeur the prefix " God has arranged that . . . . " can be dropped just as well from functional explanations as from descriptions, predictions, causal explanations and all other assertions of naturalistic fact. At this stage functional explanation is fully emancipated from the religious particularism of theistic teleology, just as theistic teleology was emancipated by Spinoza, for instance, in his own particular way from the anthropomorphic implications of purposive explanation. Purposive teleology, therefore-the use of teleological sentences for the assertion of purposive explanations-is historically prior to functional teleology, and its relationship -is that of grandparent rather than of parent. But this does not entail its being logically fundamental. It niight be asked, however, why the teleological form of expression has been retained for functional explanations alone. If their theological ancestry constitutes their only affinity to purposive explanations, why has not a teleological z 6</page><page sequence="20">274 JONATHAN COHEN. form been retained for causal explanations also, which share this linguistic ancestry ? Why is it that outside purposive explanations teleological sentences are used only for one particular type of explanation in terms of a relationship of necessary condition ? I think that the answer to these questions will emerge from comparing the ways in which causal and functional explanations, respectively, are normally put to practical use. An ordinary causal explanation suggests how its explanandum could be produced by means of its explanans. We could bring about the fall of ripe apples, for instance, by shaking the tree. But functional explanations are different in this respect. A medical text- book mnight say, for instance, " An animal consumes iodine in order to stimulate the secretions of its thyroid gland which are necessary for normal growth." And here the suggestion is of how the explanans may be controlled by means of the explanandum. As a result of this a sentence of the form " x in order to y " which might be of use for a functional explanation could be incorporated in a purposive explanation of, say, a physician's treatment which was based on the truth of the functional explanation. We might say, for instance, " The doctor mnade him consume more iodine in his diet in order to normalise his growth processes." And in both cases -in the purposive explanation as well as in the basic functional explanation-the phrase " in order to " is preceded by a phrase referring to the explanandum and followed by one referring to the explanans. On the other hand, when the agent's relevant belief implied by a purposive explanation is not a belief in a functional explana- tion but in one in terms of a causally sufficient condition the explanans and the explanandum change roles in the transition from the explanation-believed-in to the pur- posive explanation of conduct based on belief in it. Someone might explain the fall of a ripe apple, for instance, as the result of a tree's being shaken. But, if he said " They shook the tree in order to make the ripe apple fall," he is explaining the tree-shaking in terms of a plan to make a ripe apple fall. And T think it likely that the parallelism</page><page sequence="21">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 275 between functional and purposive explanations in this respect, and the relevant contrast with ordinary causal explanations, have contributed towards the continued use of teleological sentences for functional explanations despite their disuse for ordinary causal explanations. The reason for this imnportant difference between the ways in which ordinary causal explanations and functional -ones respectively, are put to practical use lies in the peculiar nature of the contexts to which the latter are applicable. Where we are confronted with a system like an organism, which is apparently such that its persistence under varying conditions is dependent on the inter-relations of all its parts we cannot seek to establish that any single part is a sufficient condition of, and therefore a means of producing, any other part. We can only acquire control by the discovery and manipulation of necessary conditions. And so far as these discoveries are expressed as explanations it will be the object, not the means, of control which will be the explanans. Some philosophers, however, have recognised some difference in logical form between functional teleology and purposive explanation, but have been reluctant to interpret the for;mer as making no reference whatever to specifically mental capacities or dispositions. Thus Professor C. D. Broad13 has called a system " teleological " if (1) it " is composed of such parts arranged in such ways as might have been expected if it had been constructed by an intelligent being to fulfil a certain purpose which he had in mind," and (2) " when we investigate the system more carefully under the guidance of this hypothesis, we discover hitherto unnoticed parts or hitherto unnoticed relations between the parts, and . . . these are still found to accord with the hypothesis." As Professor Broad pointed out, this definition of " teleology " involves " a hypothetical reference to design". It remains " a question of fact whether the system was actually the result of a design in someone's mind ". And Professor Broad held that " the real paradox about organisms " is that, unlike man-made machines, 18 Mind and Its Place in Nature, 1925, p. 82 ff.</page><page sequence="22">276 JONATHAN COHEN. " they are teleological systems which seem nevertheless to arise without design ". His theory in this respect is similar to that of Kant's in The Critique of Judgement"4, where the concept of a "purpose of nature " is asserted to be " regulative " and not " constitutive ". It can and should guide our investigations of nature " by a distant analogy " with the purposive activity of humnan beings without ascribing any design " in the proper meaning of the word " to inanimate matter. The teleological approach has heuristic and explanatory value, on Kant's view, though it does not increase our comprehension of nature. Kant, however, did not attempt to give one and the same account of teleology in respect of both the investigation of nature and also the study of other mnen's conduct, as did Professor Broad. I shall therefore first discuss the peculiarity of Professor Broad's view, and then go on to criticise the Kant-Broad theory of teleology in natural science. On Professor Broad's view we can postulate a designer of organisms but he is never found at work. Now it would be absurd to seek for the actual beliefs of such a hypothetical being, and with regard to the correctness of his beliefs we must give him the benefit of the doubt if our hypothesis is to be applied with some degree of logical rigour. If we once allowed him the possibility of error we should have no firm ground for selecting any one group of errors to attribute to him out of the unlimited number of possible mistaken beliefs. In the case of actual men and women we often infer the content of their beliefs about causal processes and matters of fact from our knowledge of the actions they take and the goals at which they aimn. And not seldom we infer from their evident or probable failure to attain their goals, if fromn nothing else, that they were mistaken in some of their beliefs. But, if Professor Broad's hypothetical designer were granted the possibility of error in his beliefs, we should have far less reliable means of establishing his goals. For instance, if we postulated that all the parts and structure of an organism are designed with the purpose of helping it to 14 Tr. J. H. Bernard, 1892, p. 280 if.</page><page sequence="23">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 277 survive, and if we were therefore forced to regard the vermiform appendix, say, as an error in the design of man, it is open to others to regard that feature of the human organism as evidence for the rejection of our particular postulate. It may be that a loose and pliable approach such as this has in fact brought about interesting scientific discoveries. But it clearly lacks sufficient rigour to con- stitute a useful mnode of scientific explanation, and perhaps Professor Broad did not intend it to do so. Purposive explanations might, however, seemn capable of rigorous application in natural science if the beliefs of the hypothetical designer were assumed to be always correct. It would then be more accurate to call him " omnniscient and infallible " rather than merely " intelligent ". But whatever the explanatory value of postulating such an omniscient and infallible designer in the course of our biological investigations it is clear that such a hypothesis would put us at a grave disadvantage in explaining the works of men and women who are so often ignorant and fallible. Moreover, since for explanatory purposes the biologist's hypothetical designer must be omniscient and infallible in his beliefs about causal processes and matters of fact, the 4 "analogy " which Kant asserted between the work of such a designer and the purposive activity of human beings is very " distant " indeed-so distant as to make the whole hypothesis logically superfluous. The biologist can only guess the hypothetical designer's purposes by identifying these with the circumstances of which the given facts are known to be the necessary condition. But the biologist can obviously infer the possible existence of these circumstances by simply combining his own knowledge of the given facts with his own knowledge about the events or processes of which these are the necessary condition without any reference to the hypothetical designer. And it introduces no new light on the situation to regard these circumstances as fulfilling the purposes of a designer. Their discovery may well open up new lines of enquiry for the biologist. But in pursuing his further investigations he can do no more than</page><page sequence="24">278 JONATHAN COHEN. apply his own knowledge about causal relationships and matters of fact in order to find out with what other features of the organism the newly discovered circumstances are related. It may be that some of these other features will have been " hitherto unnoticed " as Professor Broad puts it. But in order to make these discoveries it is no more necessary to act on the hypothesis of an omniscient and infallible designer than it is for astronomers to act on the hypothesis of a supremely accomplished celestial clock-maker in order to discover new planets. It is true that even the great Harvey, as we are told by Robert Boyle"5, was helped to his discovery of the blood by postulating " a provident Nature" which would not have placed so many valves in the veins "without design ". But the fact that a seventeenth century physician was probably unable to mnake his discovery without employing something like the Kant-Broad hypothesis does not establish anything about the psychological conditions necessary for research by twentieth century biologists. Evidence can be cited'6 from the statements of Professor J. B. S. Haldane, for instance, that he at least does not find it psychologically necessary to postulate an omniscient and infallible designer of the organisms which he investigages. Even without so postulat- ing he can proceed on the certainly frutiful hypothesis that each part of an organism " is related to all the other parts in such a way that the persistence of the whole is dependent upon this relation ". And it is a methodological hypothesis such as this, making no reference to specifically mnental capacities or dispositions like intelligence or intention, which is all that is logically requisite for the discovery of functional explanations in biology. It would have been logically adequate for Harvey, for instance. If anyone still believes instead that the Kant-Broad hypothesis is the methodological presupposition of functional explanations he is being misled by the fact that sentences of the same grammatical appear- 15 Inquiry into the Final Causes of Natural Things 1-2, quoted by G. E. Under- hill in Mind, 1904, p. 231. 16 Professor J. H. Woodger, Biological Principles, 1929, p. 430 ff.</page><page sequence="25">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 279 ance can be used to assert both functional explanations and purposive explanations. I have chosen to use the word " teleological," as a label for this grammatical cross-section, rather than as a name for the classification of logical forms and observable processes like Kant and Professor Broad, respectively, because I wish to emphasise that what generic unity there is in what commonly goes under the title of " teleology " exists solely at the level of verbal similarity and in the historical origins of modern usage. It is not a unity which extends beyond there to logical forms and observable processes. It might be objected that Kant thought a hypothesis of natural purpose necessary in order to deal with other peculiarities of organic life also besides the internal structure of organisms, to the investigation of which Professor Broad's account apparently confines its relevance. He certainly instanced the reproduction of one tree by another and the growth of an individual tree as characteristic cases of " natural purpose " where the same thing "must bear itself alternately as cause and as effect " of itself. But modern developments in genetics seem to have shown that these processes are amenable to scientific investigation without the postulation of a special type of " causal connection "' which takes place "through final causes " as Kant put it. 3. The mechanism-teleology dichotomy.-The only other common misconception which I wish to mention is the view that (in the common application of the terms) mechanism and teleology between them exhaust the logical possibilities of explanation. I have not the space to examine in this connection all the different theories, methods and outlooks which have from time to time been labelled " mechanism ".17 But I think that the error of this dichotomy can be shown from what I am saying about teleological explanations. If we were to classify explanations by references to their logical form rather than be reference to the grammar of the 17 I have in any case been forced to oversimplify the analysis of " ordinary causal explanation " and to disregard frequency explanations.</page><page sequence="26">280 JONATHAN COHEN. sentences which are used for their assertion, we could not group purposive and functional explanation together as the sole species of a distinctive logical genus. A division into dispositional and non-dispositional, for instance, cuts across the traditional category of teleology, and so does a division into explanations applicable and inapplicable, respectively, to rational agents. A division into explanations applicable to organisms and to nothing else, on the one hand, and all other explanations, on the other, would exclude some functional explanations-those used in logic and juris- prudence, for instance, to which I shall later draw attention -from the former category. And if we divided explanations according to their completeness we should have to class purposive explanations under the logical rubric " incom- plete " and functional ones as " complete ". Accordingly, if we are to classify purpose explanations and functional ones together at all, our classification must I, think, be carried out at the grammatical level and any dichotomy drawn must be fundamentally grammatical. But the exponents of the mechanism-teleology dichotomy have not intended it as a grammatical classification at all. They have thought of it rather as a logical or metaphysical dichotomny. Their doctrine has coxnmonly taken one or other (or a combination) of three different forms. (1) " Reality consists of mind and mnatter. Material phenomena have been treated most successfully by mechan- istic procedures but mind is essentially teleological. Both mechanism and teleology are unitary types of method. And therefore there are only these two procedures which are appropriate for the study of reality." (I think that Professor G. F. Stout"8, for instance, held a view very similar to this.) My specific objection to this form of the dichotomy is that functional explanations need have nothing to do with minds. So that a metaphysical dualism is no ground for the traditional mechanism-teleology dichotomy, though there are no doubt important differences in " rationality 18 Mind and Matter, 1931, pp. 39, 47.</page><page sequence="27">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 281 between the explanans of a purposive explanation and that of any other type of explanation, which I shall discuss below (2) " Mechanistic laws are concerned with the causation of events a tergo and teleological ones with their causation a fronte. Since the future and the past of any moment exhaust the whole of time there can be no other type of natural law. And therefore mechanism and teleology are the only two procedures possible for the investigation of natural phenomena." (Sir David Ross'9 has suggested that a view like this was present in Aristotle's mind. There was also some indication of its presence in Professor L. T. Hobhouse's20.) My specific objection here is firstly that the dispositions cited by a purposive explanation frequently exist before the explanandum occurs and sometimes do not persist after- wards. I may believe a certain road leads to Edinburgh, for instance, for some time and also intend going there and yet the moment I take the road in order to go to Edinburgh I mnay both realise it goes to Glasgow and decide to go there instead. And the event purposed cannot itself determine the action a fronte because it need not even exist. Our actions often fail to achieve their purposes. Moreover, functional explanations may relate simultaneous processes, as I have pointed out, as well as successive ones. This particular form of the mechanism-teleology dichotomy, therefore, is falsified by actual usage. It seems to arise from a confused attempt to apply to the temporal dimension of causation some analogue of the difference between pushing and pulling, although that difference is normally defined in purely spatial terms. (3) " Any observable system can be studied by reference either to the organised interaction of its parts or to the laws which its components would obey even in isolation. The former is teleology, the latter mechanism. And, as there is no other way of investigating a whole except either by studying it as a whole of inter-related parts or by examining 19 Aristotle, 1945, p. 73. 20 Op. cit., pp. 229-300.</page><page sequence="28">282 JONATHAN COHEN. its parts separately, there are no methods of investigating observable processes other than teleology and mechanism." (This was certainly the opinion of Professor Hobhouse2l.) This form of the dichotomy reflects an important difference between the contexts in which we utter functional and ordinary causal explanations, respectively. But purposive explanations commonly account for an act in terms of a single belief and a single want or intention without reference to other acts or dispositions. So that these teleological explanations at any rate are not necessarily concerned with organised wholes to the same degree as functional explana- tions are. - ~~III. I know of no reason why functional and purposive explanation at their various levels of generality must between them exhaust the explanatory possibilities of teleological usage. But I shall concentrate here mainly on first-order purposive explanations because, despite the frequency of their occurrence in almost every form of discourse-or perhaps because of it-, they have been very inadequately discussed by analytical philosophers. I shall then go on to a brief survey of higher-order purposive explanations and of functional explanations. 1. First-order purposive explanation.-It is with the tele- ological explanations of individual hurnan actions in terms of individual human purposes that I axn first concerned. I shall thus take as mny datum that all purposive explanations can be expressed in the form " a did (is doing, will do) x in order toy ", where a is not a supernatural agent, x is a human action andy could be called " the purpose of a's doing x I think it evident that such an explanation entails the ascription to a both of some mental attitude towards y and also of some belief about a connection between x andy. If I said to you " You went to Glenshee in order to buy a hat ", you could contradict me in a familiar idiom by 21 Op. cit. pp. 295-300.</page><page sequence="29">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 283 saying " It could never have entered my head to buy a hat ". If you had no mental attitude whatever towards buying a hat it must be false to claim that you went to Glenshee or anywhere else in order to buy one. And you could also contradict me by saying " I have intended to buy a hat for some tixne but I've certainly never thought there were any hats even to be seen by going to Glenshee ". If you were speaking the truth, then whatever your purpose in going to Glenshee you could not have gone there in order to buy a hat. This is my justification for claiming that " a does x in order toy " entails both " a believes x is somehow connected withy "22 and also " a has some mental attitude towardsy ". Moreover, whatever is the specific character of a's mental attitude towards y, it must involve a preference for y over anything else which he believes connected in the same way with x. If you believed there was a hat-shop open in Glenshee and intended buying a hat somewhere, it does not follow that you went to Glenshee in order to buy a hat. Your purpose in going there might instead have been to buy a coat, to visit a friend or just to enjoy the journey. It would only be if you set greater store on buying a hat than on anything else that might be rendered possible by your journey to Glenshee that it would be correct to say you went there to buy a hat. Whenever we have even as few as two objectives which cannot be achieved at the same time we must implicitly or explicitly grade them for priority of accomplishment. And in virtue of such a priority- grading you might have had both a main and a subsidiary purpose in going to Glenshee. Your main purpose, for instance, might have been to visit your friend, and you might have had it in mind to buy a hat afterwards if a hat-shop was still open. But neither of these would have 22 I think that this is true even of the use of first-person teleological sentences like " I am going to Glenshee in order to buy a hat " for the assertion of purposive explanations. But, when sentences like " Let us go to Glenshee in order to buy hats " are used for the announcement of proposals, what is asserted seems then to be not a belief in the connection between x andy but the con- nection itself.</page><page sequence="30">284 JONATHAN COHEN. been your purpose in going to Glenshee at all if you had not assigned a higher priority to them than to anything else you could have done there. There are many different types of connection which a may believe to hold between x andy. x can be believed a necessary or a sufficient condition ofy, or one of a disjunction of necessary or sufficient conditions, or it can be thought related to y in some permnissible conjunction of these relationships. And these connections can be believed to hold either in virtue of facts and generalisations of various types and probabilities or in consequence of linguistic usage or of moral, religious or aesthetic principles. It would be unnecessarily tedious to cite many more examples of the wide variety of types of purposive explanation which are therefore to be found. Compare, for instance, " He went to Glenshee in order to have a pleasant ride " (belief in a disjunction of causally necessary conditions and in the probable sufficiency of one of these), " He went to London in order to visit Westminster Abbey " (belief in a geographi- cally necessary condition), " He moved his cue in that way in order to pot the red " (belief in a causally necessary and sufficient condition), " He called it ' Pongo' in order to give it a name " (belief in a logically sufficient condition), " He went overseas in order to do his duty" (he thought going overseas was a necessary condition of doing his duty and he gave priority to his intention to perform his duty over any other intentions of which the fulfilment depended on going overseas), " He painted her sitting on a rock in order to complete the harmony of the picture ", and so on. In cases like the last two of these we must be careful to distinguish the moral, religious or aesthetic evaluations of the agent, which are part of the explanans, from those, if any, of the person who asserts the explanation, for the latter have no explanatory force. The failure to draw such a distinction may mislead the unwary, as it may have misled Professor J. L. Stocks23, into thinking that those purposive explanations which include terms like " duty " and 23 The Limits of Purpose, 1931, pp. 21-32.</page><page sequence="31">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 285 "harmony " are radically different in logical formn from those which do not. And we can compare with these usages the assertion of sentences like "Houses are built in order to be useful, not ornamental" which are commonly used either to assert both an evaluation-" That ought to be their purpose "-and an explanation or to cloak the former in the guise of the latter. I hope I have now shown that the assertion of " a did (is doing, will do) x in order toy " as a purposive explanation entails ascribing to a a belief and a mental attitude of the sort which I have been discussing. And I think it is also entailed by ascribing these to a and reporting that a has done (is doing, will do) x because of them. We do not require any further evidence than the existence of such a belief and such an attitude at the time in question to justify us in asserting the purposive explanation, nor would it be consistent to affirm the former and deny the latter. To defend this claim I shall consider the two. objections to it which I think are most likely to be made:- (I) " Purposive activity is the self-determination of a rational agent. It must therefore be false to claim that purposes are somehow logically equivalent to a conjunction of mere dispositions." I accept the premise of this objection and deny that the conclusion follows. To explain a man's action in terms of his own dispositions is certainly to show how far it is self- determined. Of course we might also try to explain why he had these beliefs, intentions and wishes, and if our explanation cited any facts about the man's social or physical environment it would thus show how far his dispositions were not self-determined. But it would not be inconsistent to reject this latter explanation while accepting the purposive explanation in dispositional formn. Moreover, to attribute to a man the specific dispositions which I think involved in purposive activity is certainly to regard him as a rational agent. I take it that the title " rational agent " would be given to anyone capable of appreciating the logical force of arguments for or against a course of action. But, if I assert</page><page sequence="32">286 JONATHAN COHEN. that a's doing x actualised both his intention to effect y and also his belief that x was some kind of necessary or sufficient condition ofy, I am claiming that a carried out just such an appreciation explicitly or implicitly. If I tell a friend that I intend to buy a hat and he says " You should go to Glenshee for there's an excellent hat-shop there ", I might appreciate the logical force of his argument and go to Glenshee in order to buy myself a hat. Therein I should show myself, I suppose, a rational agent. But the only difference in me between the tixne I first spoke to my friend and the time I went to Glenshee would be the belief I had acquired about the Glenshee hat-shop. It is the special character and inter-relationship of the dispositions actualised in purposive activity-i.e., conduct of which a true purposive explanation can be given-that make it a typically rational form of human behaviour. Accordingly I see no valid objection here to regarding purposive explanations as dispositional ones of the kind suggested. And by this I do not intend to suggest the misleading assertion " Purposes are nothing but dispositions ". If my purpose in going to Glenshee is to buy a hat, for instance, it is obvious that to buy a hat is not a disposition but an action. The sense of " mean " in which a purposive explanation means the ascription of certain dispositions is a comparatively weak sense, in which two logically equivalent propositions may be said to have the same meaning, not some stronger sense like for instance the one in which '' I commence " means I begin ". (2) "You have omitted to add to your analysans the proposition ' a did x deliberately' (one of Professor Ryle's 'mongrel-categoricals ,24). If you do not add this you leave open the possibility that a man who had all the appropriate beliefs and intentions you mention might nevertheless have acted in a sudden fit of irrationality without any genuine purpose whatever, in an unthinking blaze of jealousy, say, like the assassin in Sartre's Crime Passionel ". My answer to this objection is that my analysans is not 24 Concept of Mind, 1949, p. 141.</page><page sequence="33">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 287 of the form " a did x and a had certain dispositions " but " a did x because a had certain dispositions ". Thus the assertion of my analysans, like the use of a teleological sentence to assert a purposive explanation, would rule out the possibility that x was merely the expression of a momentary fit of irrationality. Nor do I think it necessary to show that x was done deliberately in order to establish that it was done in fulfilment of the relevant dispositions and not because of something else. It is necessary to show no more than that nothing happened which could have prevented a from acting on the belief and intention concerned so long as it is estab- lished that the intention involved the sort of preference I mentioned. This would be the procedure adopted at a murder-trial, for instance, where the prosecution had to refute the relevance of medical evidence that the accused might have killed his grandmother in a fit of paranoia instead of murdering her with the purpose of cashing her insurance policy. Moreover, although many purposive actions are deliber- ate I think there are also many which are not. To describe a purposive action as deliberate entails asserting that the relevant dispositions were actualised in certain occurrent thoughts as well as in the action itself. If the man killed his grandmother deliberately in order to cash her policy he must have consciously thought out his plan of action. But when I utter the phrase " Twopenny one, please " on a Dundee tram going into town in order to buy my ticket I often do so automatically and with my thoughts on other things. And I think that a great deal of human talk and other conduct is unconsciously purposive in this way. We express *our purposes in such actions, but the actions themselves have become so habitual that we do not need to think about their purposes. We generally make a deliberate choice of words, for instance, only when we wish to ensure that our meaning is not misunderstood. Even if a form of purposive action has become habitual however we should have no difficulty in bringing its purpose -to mind. This is what philosophers engaged in the analytical</page><page sequence="34">288 JONATHAN COHEN. scrutiny of linguistic usage, for instance, often do in addition to studying other people's habits25. But it is also sometimes suggested that people can have purposes which they them- selves would find it very difficult, if not impossible, to bring to mind. " I don't care what you think your purpose was ", I might say, "you really went to Glenshee in order to enjoy the journey ". This suggestion entails the claim that people can have some beliefs, intentions and wishes of which they themselves are unwilling or unable to become aware although others may learn of them. And I think that such a claim is not uncommonly admitted. Moreover, in different ways psychologists of at least two modem schools seem soxnetimes so to use purposive explanations that they imply their truth to be logically independent of the ability of the agent in question to recognise it. This is implicit in some Neo- Behaviorist studies of purposive activities in rats and other animals. What I have called " beliefs " in my analysis are called " means-end-readinesses " for instance by Professor E. C. Tolman and26 my " priority-intentions ' are " goal- seekings " for him. He and others like him are themselves mainly concerned with establishing causal laws about such dispositions. But they have certainly shown that there are purposive explanations which can be applied to animal behaviour that are of the same logical form as those applicable to human behaviour if it is admitted that we are sometimes incapable of recognising our own purposes. This occasional incapacity is also sometimes implicit, as is well known, in the use of purposive explanations by a psychiatrist during a 25 I.e., those analytical philosophers who hold they can study the meaning of most words by studying " the jobs they are used to do ". If this is a purposive theory of " meaning ", and not a functional one, it implies that people who make linguistic utterances with intent to communicate have beliefs about the causal results of their performances. It seems to be the existence of such beliefs which sometimes leads other analytical philosophers to propound a purely causal theory of " meaning ", e.g., F. P. Ramsey, Foundations of Mathematics, 1931, p. 155. On the other hand, confusion may be caused by a philosopher's failure to recognise whether he is employing a functional or purposive theory of " meaning ". E.g., an emotive analysis of ethical usage may sometimes be true for the former theory but not for the latter. 26 Purposive Behaviour in Men and Animals, 1932. Cf. A. Rosenblueth, N. Wiener, and J. Bigelow, Behaviour, Purpose and Teleology, in Philosophy of Science, vol. 10 (1943), pp. 18-24.</page><page sequence="35">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 289 course of psychoanalytic therapy. If a psychiatrist can discover the true purposive explanation of a patient's neurotic behaviour, Freudians (and novelists, playwrights, etc., influenced by them) hold that even though the patient does not at first recognise its truth there is a considerable likeli- hood that his neurosis will disappear if he can at last be brought to recognise it27. They regard the disappearance of the neurosis in such circumstances as confirmation of their hypothesis about the purpose of the patient's behaviour. But they do not generally hold this hypothesis falsified by the failure of their treatment to remove the neurosis, since this failure can always be attributed to other factors, such as the analyst's lack of professional skill or the patient's unwillingness to co-operate. I shall refer to only one other feature of purposive explanations, namely, their use by lawyers, historians, sociologists, journalists and other students of human relationships in order to establish the degrees of influence of various factors in a given situation. It is sometimes suggested28 that the only method of doing this is analogous to that employed by natural scientists. That is to say, the results of variations in the supposed determinants are to be studied either in experimental isolation or imaginary abstraction. But the degrees of influence of several factors on a man's conduct can also be studied in terms of the priority-gradings or scales of preference attributed to him by the purposive explanations of his actions. Thus a lawyer, say, can establish the relative importance for a murderer's behaviour of the fact that his grandmother's insurance-policy 27 J am not claiming that this is the only or main form of psychoanalytic therapy. Not do I think that this Freudian theory about the results of uttering purposive explanations in certain circumstances is in any way out of the ordinary as a scientific theoty. The phrase " psychoanalytic explanation " is ambiguous and in a recent controversy on this subject in Analysis it was apparently used mainly in one sense (= "purposive explanation of neurotic behaviour uttered in the course of Freudian psychotherapy") by Mr. S. Toulmin in December, 1948, and in another sense (= " that section of Freudian theory which is a causal explanation of the occurrence and dis- appearance of neuroses ") by Professor H. Dingle in March, 1949. If either of these two writers had recognised the ambiguity their views would not have seemed at variance in any important respect. 28 E.g., by Mr. W. J. Rees in Mind, Octobei, 1950, p. 512.</page><page sequence="36">290 JONATHAN COHEN. was taken out in his name and the fact that she often wrote him reproachful letters. Moreover, this method of estab- lishing influences can be put to a generalised use by historians. I might admit that except in certain fields, those of biography and diplomatic history, for instance the purposive explanation of one man's actions can be of no great explanatory value in itself. But if we know Caesar's purpose in crossing the Rubicon as well as Pompey's purpose in keeping his army in being at the gates of Rome, for instance, then we are on the way to learning inter alia something about the influence of certain factors on the behaviour of Roman proconsuls in general. If we can apply one particular purposive explanation to some individual actions performed by all or mnost members of some class of human beings we can establish thereby the degrees of influence of certain factors on the behaviour of this class as a whole. This is not as satisfactory a procedure as the- methods of experimental isolation or imaginary abstraction, both because the latter enable us to avoid relying at any stage on logically incomplete explanations like those in terms of purposes and also because they are not so likely to be affected by political or religious prejudices as is the effort to understand other people's purposes. But in the study of human relationships experiment is often impracticable, and there may be but little recorded evidence available for abstraction. Sociologists, historians and journalists have therefore frequently to be content with a less satisfactory procedure than that which is normal in natural science. Otherwise they could give no answers at all to questions like " Was the behaviour of Roman proconsuls in the last century of the Republic influenced more by the existence of an outgrown constitution than by an increase in the spoils of office ? " 2. Higher-order purposive explanation.-In answer to such a question or otherwise we often ascribe a purpose to a class of human beings on the ground that all, most or a fair sample of its individual members had this purpose. A historian might remark, for instance, " London sided with Parliament</page><page sequence="37">TELEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION. 291 in the Civil War in order to protect its financial interests " wvithout thinking it possible to find out the actual purposes of more than a very few prominent Londoners. In virtue of the inductive procedure used to establish them, therefore, higher-order purposive explanations of this type differ in logical form from lower order ones, which concern the activities of typical individuals, analogously to the way in which " All water in this well is polluted ", for instance, differs from " This sample of water drawn from the well is polluted ". And, because there is this difference of logical form in any case, we should not expect the analysis of higher-order purpose explanations like " London sided with Parliament in the Civil War in order to protect its financial interests " to correspond point-for-point with the analysis of lower-order ones. There is no more ground for claiming that the assertion of a higher-order purposive explanation implies the existence of a group-mind than there is, for instance, for holding that a sociological law about legal systems implies the existence of a divine Legislator. It is perhaps worth noting, too, that some purposive explanations are of even higher logical orders. For instance, " The nation-state always insists on education in national history in order to preserve its self-identity " is not of the same logical form as " The policeman on point-duty always holds up all traffic at noon in order to let the school children cross the road safely ". 3. Functional explanation.-On the subject of functional explanations I shall add little here to what I have already said because their logical form, is relatively simnple compared with that of purposive explanations and also widely acknowledged29. There is certainly a complex problem about what is the best terminology in which to frame functional explanations in some fields-about the value and most useful definition of " organismn ", for instance. But that is a matter for scientific rather than philosophical discussion. I am examining the logical form of teleological explanation, not 29 E.g., by J. H. Woodger, E. Rignano, R. B. Braithwaite, e.c.: cf. C. G Hampel and P. Oppenheim in Philosophy of Science, April, 1948, p. 139.</page><page sequence="38">292 JONATHAN COHEN. the merits of, say, emergent vitalism. And my thesis has been that a functional explanation asserts the explanandum to be necessary condition (logically, causally or in any other generally recognised way) of the explanans and thereby also of the persistence under varying circumstances of a whole of which both explanans and the explanandum are parts. This is how a biologist states the function of my dog's heart-beats, for instance, or, in a higher-order explanation, of the consumption of iodine in the life-cycle of frogs. It is how a mathematician or logician might state the function of some particular axioms in a deductive system30 if he was analysing the system, though if he were writing a biography of its designer he might instead give a purposive explanation of these axioms. And it is also how a jurist might state the function of the monarchy in the British constitution (though a biographer of, say, the late Earl Baldwin might introduce a purposive explanation of it). There is in principle, I think, no objection to the application of functional explana- tions in any field of human enquiry. But the extent to which this is done in any particular case will depend on a policy of regarding the explanandumn as part of a whole which such that its persistence under varying circumstances is dependent upon the inter-relations of its parts. Within such a system the problem is to discover the ways in which one part is necessary to another and so to the whole, since none can be regarded as a sufficient condition of any other3". And answers to this problem take the form of functional explanations. 30 E.g., M. R. Cohen and E. Nagel, Introduction to Logic and Scientfic Method, 1934, ch. VIII, sec. i, entitled " The Function of Axioms ". 31 This point is well illustrated by J. S. Wilkie in British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, February, 1951, p. 276: " To ask ' What is the function of the heart ? 'is a normal question and might appear in an elementary examina- tion paper for students in biology. But ' What is the effect of the heait ? ' or ' What are the effects of blood ? ' are questions which have a.very odd sound and certainly would never appear in an examination paper ".</page></plain_text>
