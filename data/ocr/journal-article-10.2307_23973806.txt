<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yasmin Haskell WORK OR PLAY? LATIN 'RECREATIONAL' GEORGIC POETRY OF THE IT ALI AN RENAISSANCE In recent years we have witnessed a new fashionability, at least within scholarly circles, of a literary genre which is decidedly out of fashion with the wider reading public: didactic poetry.11 will not here attempt to account for this modern blindness to the attractions of didactic poetry; suffice it to say that we are not dealing merely with another instance of that perennially-invoked Aristotelian challenge to Empedocles (Poetics, 1447a28).2 It is true that, in the sixteenth Century, some Aristotelian crit ics had refused the name of poet to the likes of Lucretius, Manilius, even Virgil in the Georg ics, on the grounds that their poems lacked fiction (fabula).3 At the same time, however, Latin and vernacular didactic poems were produced in great numbers — usually beyond the context of institutional Instruction which seems to have been the norm in the Mid dle Ages. One can only assume the existence of receptive audiences, that Renaissance — and for that matter, early-modern — men of letters actu ally derived enjoyment from the reading of Latin didactic poetry.4 1 For a survey of recent literature on (mainly) classical and Renaissance didactic poetry, see my preface to Poets and Teachers: Latin Didactic Poetry and the Didactic Authorìty ofthe Latin Poetfrom the Renaissance to the Present (Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Symposium of the Cambridge Society for Neo-Latin Studies, Clare College, Cambridge, 9-11 September, 1996), ed. Yasmin Haskell and Philip Hardie, Kleos, 4 (Bari: Levante Editori, 1999), pp. 5-19. 2 Our modem disenchantment with didactic poetry probably has more to do with the graduai decline of rhetorical culture since the Enlightenment. See my 'The Masculine Muse: Form and Content in the The Latin Didactic Poetry of Palingenius and Bruno', in Form and Content in Didactic Poetry, ed. Catherine Atherton, Nottingham Classical Studies, 5 (Bari: Levante Editori, 1998), pp. 117-44. 3 See Baxter Hathaway, 'Were Empedocles and Lucretius Poets?', chapter 4 of The Age of Criticism: The Late Renaissance in Italy (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1962), pp. 65-80; my 'Between Fact and Fiction: The Renaissance Didactic Poetry of Fracas toro, Palingenio and Valvasone', and Isabelle Pantin, 'Res contenta doceril Renaissance Cosmological Poetry, Classical Models and the Poetics of Didascalica', forthcoming in Haskell and Hardie, Poets and Teachers. 4 I have records of nearly three hundred early-modern didactic poems in Latin alone and am preparing a monograph on the Jesuit contribution to the genre in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</page><page sequence="2">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE 133 What was the nature of that enjoyment? Unfortunately we can only speculate about the criteria by which Renaissance readers assessed the literary merits of Latin didactic poems, old or new. The genre did not attract the (over)subtle academic debates which proliferated over narra tive and dramatic works in the Cinquecento. In any case, sixteenth-cen tury literary criticism is usually less concerned with describing the sub jective responses of readers than with measuring texts against objective Standards derived, or adapted, from antiquity. It is perhaps too early to be thinking about 'literature for literature's sake'. Moreover, while Tre cento and Quattrocento humanists had emphasised the latent moral Instruction in classical mythology and poetry, didactic poetry itself was not readily subjected to their favoured allegorical mode of exegesis: its prodesse was too intimately bound up with its delectare, and its prodesse could be of a secular, or even controversial nature. Thus it was long after Marullus and Pontano had imitated Lucretius in their Latin poetry that Denis Lambin ventured a theoretical defence of the pagan poet on more or less literary grounds.5 In the foreword to his famous edi tion of the De rerum natura (Paris, Roville, 1563), Lambin justifies the reading of Lucretius by appeal to his piain and lucid exposition of important natural questions 'sine fabularum, taliumque nugarum integu mentis'. Even if he writes as an Epicurean, 'non vere... neque pie', he does so 'ingeniöse, et acute, et erudite, et purissimo sermone'. Lambin implies that we can enjoy Lucretius' poetry for the grandeur of its sub ject and simplicity of style — without endorsing his false doctrine. Lam bin's aim here is, of course, primarily apologetic. But did Renaissance readers normally and consciously distinguish between utility and literary enjoyment in didactic poems, especially those on less contentious sub jects? And to what extent are the didactic poet's efforts to impart Infor mation clearly, or to persuade effectively, perceived as aesthetic, as opposed to pedagogie virtues in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries? In his ground-breaking new book on medieval Latin didactic poetry, Thomas Haye argues that there is no determinate break between the didactic poetry of the high Middle Ages and that of the fifteenth and six teenth centuries, and that a distinction between 'schöne Literatur' and 'Fachliteratur', especially in the German context, makes little sense.6 He 5 Cf. Pantin, 'Res contenta doceri', in Haskell and Hardie, Poets and Teachers. 6 Das lateinische Lehrgedicht im Mittelalter (Leiden: Brill, 1996), p. 392. He has also found that commentaries on classical and medieval didactic poems published in the six teenth Century are 'in der Regel nicht philologisch, sondern sachlich ausgerichtet' (p. 358).</page><page sequence="3">134 YASMIN HASKELL suggests that, apart from a few cases with obvious parodie intent, Latin didactic poetry produced in the sixteenth Century tends to reveal a 'seri ous' pedagogical purpose ('ernsthafter Absicht als Medium der institu tionalisierten Wissensvermittlung', p. 391). On the other hand, he seems to aeeept that the literary environment of the Italian Renaissance may have been a little more sophisticated;7 he also admits that, since the twelfth Century, didactic poems had existed 'die nicht unmittelbar Sach wissen vermitteln wollen und eher literarisch motiviert sind' (p. 365). In this paper I propose to investigate the problematic conceptual territory between 'parodie', 'literary' and 'serious' didactic poetry in the context of a sample of Latin poems written in Renaissance Italy on the model of Virgil's Georg ics. I call this sub-genre 'recreational georgic', for reasons which will soon become apparent. Pace Haye, who holds that the didac tic genre did not evolve significantly after the twelfth Century, I suggest that the family of poems under review in this article exhibits a distinc tively Renaissance physiognomy, albeit one combining traditional fea tures. Unlike those arduous and 'virile' philosophical poems written in the Renaissance on the model of Lucretius (e.g. by Scipione Capece, 'Palin genius' and Giordano Bruno8), our recreational georgic poems are per meated by an atmosphere of pleasure and even play. To avoid confu sion later, I should first clarify my position vis-à-vis that of a modem classicist, Peter Toohey, who has recently advanced an interesting theory about the aesthetic of the didactic genre in antiquity.9 Toohey states that: 'One of the qualities... which made didactic poetry so enduring in antiq uity was the dose association which our various authors display towards 7 E.g. pp. 346, 373. But he implies that Instruction, rather than entertainment, was uppermost in the minds of even Italian poets: 'Denn sowohl in Deutschland als auch in Italien sind viele von ihnen nicht nur Dichter, sondern — als Ärzte oder Astrologen — zugleich auch Experten innerhalb einer Disziplin' (p. 392). However, one of Haye's two favourite Renaissance examples, the astrologer-poet, Lorenzo Bonincontri, was never very representative or influential in the Italian milieu. The other, Giovanni Aurelio Augurello, may well have been appreciated as an authority on alchemy on account of his didactic poem, Chrysopoeia, but his literary ambitions for that work should not be under estimated. See my 'Round and Round We Go: The Alchemical Opus Circulatorium of Giovanni Aurelio Augurello', Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance, 59 (1997), 583 606. 8 See Haskell, 'The Masculine Muse', passim. 9 Epic Lessens. An Introduction to Ancient Didactic Poetry (London and New York: Routledge, 1996). For obvious reasons I cannot second Toohey's exhortation to appreci ate 'just how different is the didactic poetry of Greece and Rome from anything eise we possess' (p. 251).</page><page sequence="4">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE IT ALI AN RENAISSANCE 135 leisure and play' (ρ. 251). While he concedes the difficulty of accom modating Hesiod and the Presocratics within his didactic poetics of relaxation, self-referentiality and escapism, I feel that Toohey also some what overemphasises the ludic element in Lucretius and Virgil. The pri mary concepts which didactic poetry 'defines itself against' (p. 250) are, surely, not those of leisure, play and free time, but their very opposite: work. Thus when Ovid exhorts his audience to play ('ludite') in the Ars Amatoria, he is arguably underlining the parodie nature of his project by sending up this generic duty to work. On the other hand, as will become apparent from the following discussion, it is sometimes difficult to determine the point at which a didactic poem ceases to be a 'serious' didactic poem and becomes a 'play' or a 'mock' didactic poem. More over, the Neo-Latin poems we shall be examining are directed to their readers' 'leisure' in a much more obvious sense than many of those examined by Toohey.10 Not so serious sericulture? Vida's two books on the cultivation of silkworms are by far the most entertaining of the three Latin didactics produced in Renaissance Italy on this apparently unpromising subject.11 The Bombycum libri duo were written for Isabella d'Este-Gonzaga, who was delighted with the 'ele gantissima opera'. In his dedicatory letter to the marchesa, Vida explains that he has already spent seven years polishing the poem and claims that the subject has not been treated before, being 'tanto difficile, tanto da le 10 The modem concept of 'leisure' provisionally accepted by Toohey — defined as a set of pleasurable, non-utilitarian practices requiring the application of intelli gence and binarily opposed to 'work' — is somewhat anachronistic in the context of ancient reading and recreation. Cf. Peter Burke, 'Viewpoint: The Invention of Leisure in Early Modem Europe', Past and Present, 146 (1995), 136-50. Just because readers of a certain class were at leisure to read Nemesianus' Cynegetica, or Lucretius' De rerum natura, does not mean that they subsumed the activities of hunting and philos ophy — or of reading poems about these subjects — under a broader economy of 'leisure'. 11 First published Rome, 1527. References are to book and line, not page numbers. The two other poems are Lodovico Lazarelli's Bombyx (Rome, 1493?), ed. Georg Roel lenbleck in Münchener Romanistische Arbeiten, 47 (1978), 213-31, and Pier-Francesco Giustolo's De sere seu de setivomis animalibus, first published in his Opera (Rome, 1510), henceforth quoted from his Opera, Academiae Spoletinae studio rursus vulgata ac ineditis aucta, ed. Achille Sansi (Spoleto, 1855), pp. 18-35.</page><page sequence="5">136 YASMIN HASKELL Muse abhorrente, tanto insperata e fuori l'opinione di tutti'.12 It is from just this rough thread, we shall see, that the fine pleasure of the Bom byces is spun. Needless to say, Vida does not mean that the subject of his poem is difficult in the sense that Lucretius' philosophical subject is difficult (Lucr. 1. 136-45). If anything, there is an allusion to Columella, who in the preface to the tenth book of De re rustica apologises for accepting Virgil's 'difficult' challenge in Georgics 4, 147-8, viz. to write a Latin didactic poem on gardening: Neque enim aliter istud nobis fuerat audendum, quam ex voluntate vatis maxime venerandi: cuius quasi numine instigante pigre sine dubio propter difficultatem operis, verumtamen non sine spe prosperi successus aggressi sumus tenuem admodum et paene viduatam cor pore materiam, quae tam exilis est, ut in consummatione quidem totius operis annumerari veluti particula possit laboris nostri, per se vero et quasi suis finibus terminata nullo modo conspici. Nam etsi multa sunt eius quasi membra, de quibus aliquid possumus ejfari, tarnen eadem tarn exigua sunt, ut, quod aiunt Graeci, ex incompre hensibili parvitate arenae funis effici non possit. Quare quidquid est istud, quod elucubravimus, adeo propriam sibi laudem non vindicat, ut boni consulat, si non sit dedecori prius editis a me scriptorum monu mentis. (my emphasis) Columella's horticultural advice is 'serious' enough, even if he con fesses that his poetry will appear deficient because of the trivial subject matter. Vida, on the other hand, positively revels in the diminutive nature of his theme, realising, like Virgil, that 'in tenui labor; at tenuis non gloria' (Georgics, 4, 6). But has Vida chosen a difficult subject merely to show off his poetic powers, as an excuse for rhetorical dis play? Does the Bombyces have a 'serious' didactic purpose? One thing seems clear at least -— that Vida has a sense of humour. The question of irony in Virgil's treatment of the bees in Georgics 4 is a vexed one; not so in Vida's Bombyces. In Virgil's poem, for example, the loss of Aristaeus' bees is occasioned by grave hubris and frames the moving tale of Orpheus and Eurydice. In his mannerist Variation on the myth, Vida has Venus' silkworms die when their 12 For the correspondence between Vida and Isabella see A. Bertolotti, 'Autografi di Girolamo Vida', 11 Bibliofilo, 5 (1884), 183-5. According to Stephen Kolsky, Isabella may have had difficulty construing Vida's Latin, let alone savouring its subtleties ('Images of Isabella d'Este', Italian Studies, 49 (1984), 47-62). In any event, the gift of the poem must have pleased her inasmuch as it enhanced her image as a woman of learning.</page><page sequence="6">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALI AN RENAISSANCE 137 house is knocked over by boisterous cupids at play (2, 211-22). Play is certainly an important key. The poem might be characterised, at one level, as a game, a Virgilian treasure-hunt for the attentive reader. Vida rehabilitates most of Virgil's georgic modules, with Instructions on housing the worms, on protection against pests, on caring for the sick and disposai of the dead.13 He is perhaps more prone than Virgil to epic parody, as when the marauding mouse: 'rages through all the halls, dripping with gore' ('saevitque per omnes I caede madens aulas', 1, 126-7). The spinning work of the 'wool-spouting youth' ('pubem lanivomam'; 1, 244-5) is an heroic performance. The valiant souls 'give their all, as if competing for the palm of honour' ('quasi de palma summas contendere vires'; 1, 348), even to the point of laying down their lives: 'so great is the glory of producing thread' ('tanta est edendi gloria fili'; 1, 343). The Virgilian line (Georgics, 4, 205) trans figured cannot fail to provoke a knowing smile. While Vida anthropomorphises his silkworms, he downplays, at a stroke, the significance of their sentience. What might first look like sen timentality is as often as not motivated by a penchant for droll humour. The worms must be ushered into the 'media penetralia' of their high home, to prevent accidental falls: 'Huic generi facilis leti via. protinus aegras I Delapsae effundunt animas, lucemque relinquunt' (1, 264-5). But should the victim continue to 'feast on the air of heaven' ('coeli vescitur aura' ; 1, 266), under no circumstances is he to be retumed to his comrades if he has sustained injury: 'Nullam operam omnino, nullum expectabis ab illa I Certa opus, ignavum deducet inutilis aevum, I Et comitum egregias tantum mirabitur artis' (1, 270-2). This is Virgil again (Georgics, 4, 88-94), but the very conspicuousness of the allusion deflects attention away from the pathos of the disabled worm to Vida's poetic art. As for the fate of the unproductive worker, Vida Substitutes the euphemistic 'proiice' for the expected Virgilian 'dede neci', but he is not always so coy when it comes to supplying gory details. Among the perils which await our hapless worms in the second book are the splut tering oil-lamp which 'totos deformet peste penates' (2, 97) and — 'scelus nefandum'! — the malicious lacing of their leaves with sah. (Is Vida slyly hinting at some sort of sadistic experiment?) The effect on the victim of this salt-poisoning is devastating: 13 There is an occasionally Lucretian colour to Vida's verse: 'caeco... carcere clau dant' (1, 342); 'aquai' (2, 68).</page><page sequence="7">138 YASMIN HASKELL Protinus elucet languentibus aurea pellis, Deinde tument, turpisque animis ignavia venit Desidibus, tandem rumpuntur, et omnia tetro Inficiunt tabo. sanies fluit undique membris, Nec quicquam salso Venerem aequore profuit ortam. (2,103-7; my emphasis) The final cheeky jab of erudition — 'nor does it avail them at all that Venus was born from the salt sea' — abruptly deflates the tragic tone. Elsewhere, Vida exploits the ungraceful appearance and behaviour of his grubs, especially for contrast with Virgil's bees. They are gluttonous and have no table manners; they veritably lay siege to their 'dapibus... opimis': avidae dapibus implentur opimis. Fit strepitus, longe qualem olim saepe solemus Cum pluit, in tecto clausis audire fenestris. Nec mora, nec requies, properant, et grandia morsu Attondent folia emensae, redeuntque, iterumque Incumbunt, longam nequeunt explerier alvum, Dum superant frondes, et plenae pabula mensae. (1, 172-7)14 The humour arises chiefly out of our cheated expectation that the worms will do battle with each other. Indeed, within ten lines they will be fighting — although hardly manifesting the warrior spirit of Virgil's bees. Vida encourages Isabella to tease her ravenous pets by having them tussle over a single mulberry-frond: '... prius iniice ludens I Fron dem unam, ac certare sine, illae protinus omnes I Arrexere animos cupi dae, praedamque capessunt I Certatim, pariterque ingens subit ardor edendi' (185-8).15 Their sexual appetite is no less voracious; in the sec ond book we learn: 'nec Veneris brevis usus erit, videre revincti I quar tam saepe diem...' (2, 305-6).16 And when a worm shuns his food and falls asleep at the dinner table, Isabella is not to fear the outbreak of some dire disease; these workers, in pointed contrast to Virgil's bees, 14 Cf. Virgil: 'fit sonitus, magnum mixtae glomerantur in orbem I praecipitesque cadunt; non densior aere grando, I nec de concussa tantum pluit ilice glandis' (Georgics, 4, 79-81). Note how Vida's version of the meteorological simile accentuates enclosure and domestication: 'in tecto clausis... fenestris'. 15 One is tempted to see a pun in 'edendi': here 'eating', but later (with long first syl lable), 'producing'. Cf. 1, 343 above (p. 137). 16 But they are not indiscriminate in their lust, like animals of the wild: 'Nec vero, velut in silvis genus omne ferarum, I Alituumque, vagos passim furantur amores, I Sed connubia certa, sed electi hymenaei' (2, 299-301; cf. Catullus 64, 141).</page><page sequence="8">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALI AN RENAISSANCE 139 are naturally sluggish! (1, 273-9). The bee-worm thematic is beautifully encapsulated in the at once touching and bathetic image of Venus' deceased silkworms preparing to cross the river Styx. When they recog nise their mistress, who has come to rescue them, they flit around her face and applaud her with their wings, unconsciously indicating the means of their imminent salvation. Iamque ibant umbrae tenues Styga circunfusae Obscura, nigrosque lacus, et rauca fluenta. Tum dominae adventu laetae circum ora volantes Nondum oblitae alis plausere, et signa dederunt Laetitiae nondum trans livida flumina vectae. (2, 239-43)17 Later, when this mythical death and resurrection is literally re-enacted by Isabella's worms, the rebom moths will marvel at their new bodies: Ecce autem ut rostro follem terebravit acuto, Protinus erumpit (visu mirabile monstrum) Alitis in parvae bombyx collecta figuram, Et nova se rerum facies mirantibus offert. Haerent attoniti rerum novitate neque audent Remigio alarum se aperto credere coelo, Dissimilesque sui tacite nova corpora secum Mirari, forma nec sese agnoscere in illa. Comua mirantur fronti, mirantur et alas... (2, 264-7; 273-7) The worm wonder is infectious. The poem itself is designed to inspire admiration, both for its intrinsically wonderful naturai subject and for the poet's impressive rhetorical rendering of it. Indeed, Vida's professed aim in this juvenile work is to win the hearts of nubile maids. They are invoked in the proem with a touch of mock-solemnity: 'Et vos ο placidae properate, ubi quaeque, puellae'. In the closing lines of the poem we are advised that Italy is the land 'unde sacri viridem vates petiere coronam, I Et meritis gratas sibi devinxere puellas'. The contours of the Renaissance Latin recreational georgic — of which Vida's Bombyces is a typical example — differ from those of the Virgilian prototype in a number of small but telling respects. Pontano is the father of the sub-genre with his De hortis Hesperidum sive de cultu 17 Cf Aeneid, 6, 706-9, where the souls of the dead awaiting rebirth are compared to bees.</page><page sequence="9">140 YASMIN HASKELL citriorum; it is surely no accident that this poem was dedicated to Francesco Gonzaga, future husband of Isabella D'Este, the addressee of Vida's Bombyces.ls The scale of Pontano's Neo-Latin poem is radically diminished vis-à-vis the Georgics\ not only because there are two books instead of four, but because the scene and consequences of the action are provincial, not national. The Bay of Naples is the enchanted setting, heavy with the perfume of Paestan roses and teeming with Pontano's trademark naiads and dryads. The Marquess of Mantua had been victo rious over Charles VIII at Fornovo in 1495, as Octavian had been victo rious over Antony, but Pontano's poem is directed to the prince's private pleasure, his well-earned repose, not to the glorification of a future regime. De hortis Hesperidum is not a programme for (nor a veiled cri tique of) empire, but a confined and highly artificial space in which the twentieth-century reader may feel a little claustrophobic. In broad typological profile, then, the Renaissance Latin recreational georgic usually comprises one or two short books, treats self-con sciously small-scale subjects, is informed by an almost pastoral mood, is trimmed with omamental myths of metamorphosis in Ovidian rather than Virgilian vein, and celebrates a mild and domesticated Nature whose beauty and bounty can be enhanced through human industry. This is a marvellous Nature, producing luxury gifts to order for the poems' aristocratic addressees: citrus fruits, saffron, decorative climbing plants, omamental rock gardens, perfumes, trompe l'oeil topiary sculpture, and, perhaps the most exquisite of all Nature's freely-bestowed favours, silk.19 In his Kultur der Renaissance in Italien (1860), Jacob Burckhardt claimed that Renaissance Italians had given voice — in poetry, letters and landscape painting — to a distinctively modem sensitivity to natural beauty. This view has become something of a cliché, but it might still be 18 For itemised correspondences between Pontano's De hortis Hesperidum and the second book of Virgil's Georgics, see Walther Ludwig, 'Neulateinische Lehrgedichte und Vergils Georgica', in Litterae Neolatinae: Schriften zur neulateinischen Literatur (Munich, 1988), 100-27, at pp. 107-8. 19 Pontano's poem was first printed in his Opera (Venice, 1505), ff. 138r-159v (A much less sophisticated poem on trees had been written by the Fiorentine humanist, Bar tolomeo Scala.

Do we find, in our Renaissance poems, the seeds of that fashion for panoramic landscape and botanical detail which found its full flowering in eighteenth-century English 'georgic', e.g. Thomson's Seasonsl This does not seem to be the case. Vida's Bombyces begins with a turning away from the state of Nature, from a golden age before Culture. The silkworms once lived in the woods, rude and uncultured like men of prehistoric times, having no concern for 'the dignity nor the glory of fine silk' ('tenui nee honos, nee gloria filo'; 1, 17); their art hung, unappre ciated, from tree branches, and was swept away by the wind and the rain. When humans discovered this divine treasure we are told that 'they fed the wild moths in houses and enclosures' ('in tectis, atque intra septa domorum I Silvestres tineas alere'; 1, 23-4). Later, Vida cautions his pupil: 'But I warn you, do not let them wander unaccompanied in the woods and do not fail to expend effort on their dwellings'('Sed tu ne, moneo, in silvis permitte vagari I incustoditas, nec curam adhibere recusa I in tectis'; 1, 38-40). He lovingly describes the construction of the silkworm farm, a haven for these delicate creatures from the dangers of the wild world outside: avium insidias, et callida furta Averte, illudit passer custodibus olim Improbus, illudit chortis cristata volucris. Dant stragem passim rostris immitibus, implentque Ingluviem, ac vivo viva abdunt corpora busto. (1, 109-13) As will be seen from line 113, the worms are vulnerable to the same dangers as Lucretius' primitives (cf. Lucr. 5, 993). Civilisation is their salvation. Like VirgiTs bees, the worms are particularly sensitive to noise (2, 113-6). One should not let curious small boys near the farm (117-24), nor accost the delicate workers with the odour of onion or gar lic on the breath (125-7). The serving woman or the old woman can be harmful, with her witching songs and evil-eye (135-7). Only beautiful youths and young women may approach (138-41). 20 I.e. in Part 4, 'Die Entdeckung der Welt und des Menschen'. He briefly discusses didactic poetry in his section on Neo-Latin Poetry in Part 3, 'Die Wiedererweckung des Altertums'.</page><page sequence="11">142 YASMIN HASKELL Vida's Nature in Bombyces is one of sentimentalised spring, of urbane youth and good looks, starkly contrasted with the rudeness of the authentic country. Real Nature intrudes in the anecdote about the wild man of Viterbo, almost an evil double of Virgil's Corycian gardener (Georgics, 4, 116-49): Quandoquidem memini Tusci alta in rupe Viterbi Ipse senem vidisse ferum, cui dira rigebant Ora, gravesque oculi suffecti sanguine circum, Fronsque obscoena situ, hirtique in vertice cani. Ille truci, scelus, obtutu genus omne necabat Reptantum, tenuis animas, parvasque volantes. Quin etiam si quando hortos ingressus, ubi annus Exuit expleto turpem novus orbe senectam, Floribus et passim per agros incanuit arbor, Ille hortis stragem dedit, arboribusque ruinam, Spemque anni agricolae moesti flevere caducam. (2, 142-52) Uncivilised, ugly, and old, the unfortunate Viterban is portrayed as a natural disaster working against the harmonious forces of garden growth. In sum, the Bombyces is quintessentially about Culture, not Nature — at least not in our modern understanding of the word. Of course, any reader of Virgil will know how intimately Culture and Nature were associated already in the Roman imagination.21 But Culture in the recreational georgics of the Renaissance is, above all, patrician cul ture, and its products are designed for aesthetic contemplation and 21 See, e.g., David O. Ross Jr., Virgil's Elements. Physics and Poetry in the Georgics (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), pp. 14-25. 22 In Valeriano's De mìlacis cultura, the seeds of the marvellous plant are compared to more precious commodities, the currency of cardinale rather than gardeners: Semina conspicies varianti cortice picta, Veliera quae Assyriis Vincent fucata venenis, Haec Meliboea velut pinxisset purpura &amp; illa De collo dices pavonum hausisse colorem, lila ebur, illa aurum, illa ebenum simulare putabis... (63) According to Prof. R. Pampiniani, whose verdict is reported by Luigi Alpago-No vello, the subject of De milacis cultura is the Phaseolus oblongus Sarei. Internal evidence suggests that the poem was composed between 1533-1534, leading Alpago Novello to impute to Valeriano: 'l'onore... di avere fino dal 1532 introdotto, prima a Belluno e poi nel territorio di tutte e tre le Venezie, l'utilissimo e gustoso legume, il nostro fagiuolo, giustamente chiamato la carne del povero...' ('Spigolature Vati cane di argomento Bellunese', Archivio Veneto-Tridentino, 9 (1926), 69-96, p. 84).</page><page sequence="12">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALI AN RENAISSANCE 143 ostentation.22 Attention is frequently drawn to human artwork, and through it — often very consciously, it seems — to the poems them selves as artful constructs. The motif of weaving, one of the oldest metaphors for poetic composition, becomes especially prominent towards the end of Vida's Bombyces. As if with a wink, Vida teils us that there is more than one way of weaving: 'Nec modus est simplex texendi' (2, 362). The young girls who have been picturesquely involved at all stages of production will now create charming pastoral scenes from the threads of the harvested silk. Describing textiles which change colour with the light, Vida cannot resist an allusion to Virgil's golden bough: 'Vidi etiam varium quae mutant texta colorem, i elu dantque oculos, ut discolor aura refulsit' (2, 371-2; my emphasis). This is precisely the sort of thing he will say about texts in De arte poetica, where he advocates — and goes on to demonstrate — an ostentatious imitation of the best classical poets.23 In Bombyces, moreover, Vida does not pass up the opportunity of spinning a couple of modem aetiological yams from ancient thread. I have already alluded to Venus' patronage of the silkworms: they were a gift from Saturn, a reward for her advice on seducing a nymph, and they will provide the naked goddess with the clothing which Pallas has jeal ously denied her. The closing myth ends happily for 'Serius', the myth ical Eastem king who is said to have brought the technology of silk to Italy. Pursuing one of the sisters of Phaethon, Serius is distraught to find that his beloved has been transformed into a tree. He literally dissolves into tears and, as the river Serio (a tributary of the Po), bathes the dryad's feet until he has penetrated her bark shell. His wedding gifts to her include, appropriately enough, fine embroidered garments from his homeland ('Cui picturatas vario subtegmine vestes, I Illusasque auro tunicas, et tenuia laetae I Texta dedit missa a patriis sibi munera terris'; 2, 428-30). The 'tenuia... texta' are emblematic of Vida's poem itself. There are overtones of Virgil's bucolic 'tenui... avena' and georgic 'in tenui labor', but the emphasis here, I suggest, is on the poem as artifact. Vida's Bombyces is a highly-fmished objet d'art — a personalised 'People's meat' maybe — but Valeriano's Latin poem was never intended for a peas ant audience ! 23 For Vida's endorsement of poetic piracy: 'Saepe palam quidam rapiunt, cupiuntque videri I Omnibus intrepidi, ac furto laetantur in ipso I Deprensi, seu quum dictis nihil ordine verso I Longe alios iisdem sensus mira arte dedere, I Exueruntque animos verbo rum impune priores' (De arte poetica, 3, 223-7).</page><page sequence="13">144 YASMIN HASKELL antique, as it were, for one of the most discerning and acquisitive col lectors of her Century.24 Needless to say, the agricultural work of the Bombyces, assigned specifically to the fair sex, does not require any significant physical labour: 'faciles hic discite cultus' (1, 12; my emphasis). This is much less of an 'outdoors' poem than Virgil's Georgics. Even if the primary addressee, Isabella, is invited to participate in the action, her duties are not to be onerous. Vida's pupil is directed to observe the stars and sea sons, like Virgil's farmer, but she can delegate any hard work to her superiors in age and inferiors in social class. The task of collecting net tles and blackberries for worms born prematurely is best left to an old woman. The work is tough and the woods are full of lecherous satyrs — no place for young maidservants, let alone Isabella herseif:25 Sunt aliae, quae, si foetus sibi nascitur ante Quam Thysbea novis adolescat frondibus arbos, Urticamque, rubosque legunt, dum plurimus humor Vere subest. at tu teneris tunc parce puellis: Crura, manusque arment facito, nec robora dura Ascendat permitte in silvis innuba virgo.

(1, 215-25) Vida effectively denies Isabella the satisfaction of even feeding her worms when he stipulates virginity as a curious requirement: 'Sed prodest, nondum thalamos experta puella I Prima manu tenera teneras si pascat alumnas' (1, 154-5). Virgil, of course, did not seriously expect his educated readers to go out and get their hands dirty — to push the plough or spread manure — but the fiction of hard reader labour is sustained 24 For Isabella's obsession with precious objects and antiques, and the unscrupulous lengths to which she was prepared to go in obtaining them, see M. C. Brown, '"Lo insa ciabile desiderio nostro de cose antique". New Documents for Isabella d'Este's Collec tion of Antiquities', in Cultural Aspects of the Italian Renaissance in Honour of Paul Oskar Kristeller, ed. Cecil H. Clough (Manchester, 1976), pp. 324-53. 25 To the modem reader, the poet's chivalrous concem to protect the tender thighs and reputations of blushing maids will seem a little patronising. The restriction on the girls' movement — and implicitly Isabella's — parallele Vida's earlier injunction to domesticate the silkworms ('ne... in silvis permitte vagari I Incustoditas ~ nec... permitte in silvis').</page><page sequence="14">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE 145 throughout the Georgics. In Bombyces, on the other hand, it is difficult to imagine getting our hands dirty. If Virgil's poem is a back-breaking field, Vida's is a well-tended Renaissance garden which requires only a little watering; it is interesting to observe how Vida's motifs of protec tive enclosure and exemption from manual duties become even more insistent in a horticultural didactic of the later sixteenth Century. The walled garden Giuseppe Milio's De hortorum cultura (Brescia, 1574) was dedicated to his girlfriend, coincidentally another Isabella.26 I am unaware of any other didactic poem of any period which is written from motives of chivalry or seduction: whatever its other merits, didactic has never been considered one of the sexier genres. Towards the dose of the second book, Milio is describing preparations for a locai festival. Isabella mag nanimously invites the young girls of the town into her secret preserve and they marvel at her luxuriant garden, vying for permission to pick the best flowers and to have their festal garlands woven by Isabella herself (2, 37-8). But she is not so generous to her neighbours. Milio assumes that Isabella will want to incite the envy of her peers with the delights of her superior garden: 'At tu, vicinas tibi si invidisse puellas I Laetum olus ISABELLA velis; si crescere in Horto I Ipsa tuo teneras cupies felicius herbas...' (1, 11; my emphasis). And just as she will not wish to share her gardening secrets with the outside world, the poet betrays a desire to keep his mistress to himself, to confine her safely within the walls of his carefully landscaped hortus conclusus. The symmetry and seclusion of the garden find their counterpart in Isabella's own dignified composure and reserve. When she is not retiring to a private spot appointed for meditation and prayer, she — or, at least, the ideal Isabella — will sii demurely in her golden-age garden, enjoying the simple fruits of her labours: . 26 References are to book and page numbers of this first (and only) edition; the text is sometimes corrupt and I have made silent emendations where possible. Milio (also known as 'Mejo' and 'Voltolina') was born in Salò in 1536, and was a founding member of the 'Academy of the Unanimous'. Angelo Querini dedicates several pages to Milio's poem in his Specimen litteraturae quae in urbe Brixia florebat (Brescia, 1739), reporting that even the poet's own townspeople were largely ignorant of it (Part 2, pp. 259-68). Both here and in the (unpaginated) first volume, Querini favourably contrasts Milio's modesty with the pompousness of his French successor in horticultural poetry, René Rapini</page><page sequence="15">146 YASMIN HASKELL Felix non alii virgo studiosa laboris: Si haec vario non pingit acu sibi suppara textu, Si sibi non alio vestis variata colore Induitur, nec ferre datur sibi serica, laeto En proba, nec non casta sedei, nulli invida, in Horto, Et patiens operum, gratoque assueta labori, Securos agit ecce dies, vivitque beata, Optatas cui fundit opes iustissima Tellus. (1, 18; my emphasis) In one purple passage, Milio affects to allow his sweetheart a free rein in iemale company. A bevy of young girls throngs Isabella's garden, lin gering there ali day long, meeting ffiends, picking flowers. They may go wherever they wish, unguarded ('Incustoditas quoquoversum ire puellas I Circum, interque olerum sylvas iuvat, &amp; legere inde I Tempora queis varios ornet sibi singula flores'; 2, 33, my emphasis). Isabella's sister takes charge of the refreshments and a ceremonious drinking party ensues. But the rites of these gentle Bacchantes are carefully controlied; their chastity (and Isabella's!) is ensured by the presence of a garrulous old woman who sits by the gate, reminiscing about her childhood. For whom, we might ask, is the fantasy really designed? In another passage, Milio paints a pretty picture of Isabella setting an example for her servants with her enthusiastic watering: Huc, cum prima rubens Aurora illuxerit orbi, Vespere vel sero noctis surgentibus umbris, Haud segnis, nec sola veni; tecum omnis in horto Grex ancillarum comes adsit, quae tibi dulces De puteo certatim undas dent ordine longo. Te iuvet hos versare manu, mea fiamma, liquores, Et iactare solo, glebasque rigare calentes. (3, 47)27 27 Cf. Valeriane), De milacis cultura: 'cape vasa prior, cape sedulus urnam I Ante alios (nunquam alma Pales respexit inertem I Agricolam) manibusque tuis superingere fontes, I Atque tui exemplo segnes incende ministros...' (62). Watering the garden was a respectably 'soft' assignment. With Virgil Georgics, 1, 269-72, compare the following idyllic passage from Pontano's De hortis Hesperidum: Non me Aut pudeat, dum mane suas Philomela querelas Instaurai, seu maiores sol suscitai umbras, Piena manu liquidis invergere dolia lymphis, Spumantemque cavis inferre canalibus amnem, Solari &amp; mollem cantu mulcente laborem... (140v, my emphasis)</page><page sequence="16">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALI AN RENAISSANCE 147 The vignette is interesting because it is one of the few occasions upon which Milio solicits Isabella's active participation in the work of the poem. But if she must make an effort to get up at dawn ('haud segnis'), Isabella is never exhorted to carry out any really onerous tasks. Milio has to be careful about asking his well-bred young lady to work up an unseemly glow. He negotiates the problem rather wittily in the opening lines of the poem: Hortorum hic cultus disces; quid scilicet Hortos Perpetuo laetos faciat bene olentibus herbis, Ni gravibus renuis terram subvertere rastris Et brevibus versam pala distinguere sulcis; Non labor, Hesperides foelices quo minus Hortos Excolerent, ullus fecit; labor ullus amatos Negligere Hortorum cultus, induxit Adonin; Alcinoum nunquid, cui iam phoeacia tellus Pamit, &amp; populo dixit, qui iura superbo, Sub pingui puduit lactucam condere terra? (1, (1)-1, my emphasis) Note the playful cheating of syntactical expectation: Wo work at ali... deterred the daughters of Hesperus from cultivating their happy gardens; no work led Adonis to neglect his beloved horticulture', and the appeal to mythological models to excuse some of the potentially demeaning chores to come. Such chores are, in fact, almost entirely exe cuted by Isabella's maidservants. It is they, for example, who spread dung or 'cinerem... immundum' on the clods (1, 2; 9), they who tum the soil and collect floor sweepings for compost (1, 3; 9), they who do the weeding (1, 10). As in Vida's Bombyces, the back-breaking labour is more suitable for a sturdy old peasant woman! Tunc rastro versare gravi mala gramina vobis Convenit, ingratumque solum mollire colendo; Tunc opus est pala; debetur tunc labor Hortis Praecipuus, mihi quo sudet defessa, licet sit Frigus, &amp; illa annis virgo matura, potensque Viribus, &amp; duris assuefa laboribus; at tu Per famulam, si dura nimis tibi rastra videntur, Incultam exercebis humum ISABELLA... (1, 3; my emphasis) Isabella's labour, where it is required, will be decorous and almost dec orative. In the charming box-clipping scene, the poet envies the good for tune of the box trees which are being skillfully trimmed by his mistress.</page><page sequence="17">148 YASMIN HASKELL The peculiar syncopation generateci by the repetition of 'heu' nicely echoes Isabella's manipulation of the branches and the snipping of her shears: Tu interea, tua dum faciunt mandata sorores, Frondosos rigida detundas forcipe buxos Sedula, quo docte ad rectam revocentur amussim. Invideo buxi vobis, formosa quod, heu me, Quod mea vos Domina, heu, tanto dignatur honore. Vos, heu, nunc flectit digitis, nunc alligat, heu, vos In nodum, vestra atque simul nunc brachia nectit. Sic, sibi quo nostros iuncti referatis amores, Invideo vobis, proh, quae est nunc vestra voluptas? Nunc vos illa manu tractat formosa decenti, Vos nunc alloquitur mea vobis carmina dictans; Felices buxos! quid fortunatius usquam? (3, 43-4, my emphasis) The mannerist conceit of the last two lines quoted, in which Milio imagines that Isabella will serenade the lucky box trees with his own songs, seems to recali Virgil's 'o fortunatos nimium, sua si bona norint, I agricolas...' (Georgics, 2, 458-9). The effect is faintly, and perhaps deliberately, ridiculous, as in the young poet's mock-suicidal protesta tions of love at the beginning of this book (3, 40-1). While the horticultural precepts laid down by Milio are by no means impractical,28 the mythological confectionery, as in so many of these Renaissance georgics, may prove a little too sweet to twentieth-century taste. (Here it takes the form of a love triangle between Neptune, Tavine, a locai nymph with whom he is infatuated, and her ill-fated lover, Cis sus). Sweetness, in fact, is a leitmotif of the third book, where the word 'dulcis' alone occurs over twenty-five times in eighteen pages. Milio stops just short of calling the garden snails 'sweet', as they succumb to spring love: 28 'Euphrastus', the author of a prefatory letter, vouches for the accuracy of Milio's herbal remedies and Supplements them with his own Hortensia remedia ad omnes mor bos, in prose. De hortorum cultura was clearly understood to be a useful work, if also an elegant and enjoyable one: 'Quare habet lector hortorum perfectam &amp; absolutem doctri nam mira versuum elegantia conscriptam. Sunt enim versus omnino elegantes, candidi, &amp; cum admirabile suavitate graves, &amp; magnifici. Mirus est author in rerum descriptionibus, mirus in fabellis suavissimis confingendis excitat undique delectationem ac animi quan dam iucundissimam titillationem.' Euphrastus declares that Milio has surpassed Co lumella in literary merit.</page><page sequence="18">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ΓΓALLAN RENAISSANCE 149 dulces (res nulli incognita) flammas Concipiunt, queis quaeque suis pro sensibus ardent.

(3, 48-9, my emphasis) Labor Improbus Not all Neo-Latin recreational didactics were so 'environmentally friendly'. Up to this point I have been discussing what might be dubbed the feminine side of the sub-genre (not to imply, however, that such poems were exclusively addressed to women). More masculine tastes were catered to by poets like Natale Conti and Pietro Angèli da Barga, who produced extended Latin hunting poems.29 The emphasis in these larger works is on manly adventure, on doing heroic battle with wild beasts — although Virgil's Georgics is stili, interestingly, the dominant model. In Angèli's Cynegetica, for example, we are con fronted with a sometimes disconcerting picture of the guile and vio lence perpetrated on the hunted animals — and by us, after ali, the poem's implied actors — which resonates strangely with Virgil's poignant intimations of animai sentience in the Georgics. These poems deserve more attention than I can devote to them here; for the purposes of the present discussion I will restrict myself to Angèli's Ixeutìcon Uber, his unfinished poem on bird-catching.30 This is a much shorter and tighter work than the Cynegetica, and seems to have been more 29 Natale Conti, De venatione libri IIII. Hieronymi Ruscelli scholiis brevissimis illus trati (Venice, 1551); Pier-Angèli da Barga, Cynegeticon libri VI (Lyon, 1561). These poems are discussed in chapter 4 of my unpublished doctoral dissertation: 'Nec dulcia carmina quaeras: Difficulty and Pleasure in Latin Didactic Poetry of the Italian Renais sance' (University of Sydney, 1995). 30 References are to the 1585 edition of the Poemata Omnia·, emphases my own.

We shall see, however, that Angèli allows a shadow to fall over that formerly cloudless, pastoral space. The Ixeuticon Uber opens with a frank announcement of the violence, deceit and effort that are prerequisites for this sport: 'Hinc quibus insidiis auceps instructus &amp; armis I Decipiat volucres... Quantus &amp; accipitrum generi labor instet habendo' (177, my emphasis). The poet lets us know in no uncertain terms that he has his work cut out for him : Non ego nunc primum, qua vatum incedere nullus Est ausus, nulla usquam extant vestigia, nulli Ingressus, aditusque patent; immo omnia clausa, Omnia sunt obstructa, &amp; sentibus obsita densis, Ire paro, suetus duras multo ante salebras, Exuperare, iterum ignotos recludere Calles Aggredior, cursumque novo contendere campo. Nec me suscepti vis ulla immensa laboris, Quaeque novis animum verborum in rebus egestas Angit, &amp; obscuris praeclara inventa tenebris Saepe tegit, turpi victum formidine franget, Dulcis ut expertem laudis traducere vitam, Quae mihi restat adhuc, ignava per otia malim. (178-9, my emphasis) The imagery of beating a path through difficult terrain recalls Lucretius, and the implication is that we readers, too, will have to put some effort into the poem. But the refusai of 'ignava otia' (last line quoted) in this 31 In the nineteenth Century, Giovanni Pascoli wrote of the Ixeuticon Uber: 'Elegante, vero, vivo, tutto odoroso di campagna e selva' (Il Bargeo (Rome, 1896), p. 3). The poem attracted three Italian translators (q. v. Innamorati, Arte della Caccia, pp. 116-17). 32 See below on 'Chloris', p. 151. In contrast, the countryside of Angèli's Cynegetica is an exclusively masculine environment, from which the hunters return to boast about their exploits to pretty girls: 'Ai iuvenes una villarum ad teda reversi, I Inter se alternis convivia grata frequentanti I Et facta exponunt timidis male tuta puellis I Quisque sua' (155, my emphasis). That bird-catching was a pastime considered equally suitable for young men and women is suggested by the following passage from Milio's De hortorum cultura·. Quin etiam ISABELLA potes, si quando vacabit, Retiaque, &amp; pedicas, laqueos, viscumque dolosum Ponere, fallaces caveasque cadente panico Tegmine supposito ingressas claudente volucres; Hoc namque aucupium quam te exercere iuvabit? (1: 13)</page><page sequence="20">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE IT ALI AN RENAISSANCE 151 grandiloquent proem — addressed to the young Francesco, future Grand Duke of Tuscany — is belied by the poem's peroration, a Variation on the finale of Georgics 2, where the poet invites his girlfriend Chloris to join him in the easy life (201-2). In the countryside, far from the madding crowd, they will swim in refreshing streams and watch the shepherd lead ing his flocks back to stable as evening comes on; they will sing to the sweet notes of a rustie reed pipe and 'here live purely and pass a peaceful life in ease, the ease which always accompanies unbroken peace' ('hic puriter aevum I Degere, tranquillamque per otia ducere vitam, I Otia per petuarti Semper comitantia pacem'). They will eat a vegetarian diet of innocent fruits ('innoeuis... pomis'), grapes, strawberries and plums, and their fine fare will be procured 'without deeeit' ('epulas sine fraude paratas').33 What goes before, however, is all fraus and labor improbus. Thus, after a preliminary survey of the different bird species and their roosts, we are given a taste of unpleasant things to come: Omnibus his certas anni pro tempore fraudes Texendum, certosque dolos: neque tenuia tantum Retia, sed pedicas etiam, viscumque parandum, Et teretes laqueos, distinetaque licia nodis Tortiiibus; quae cervices implexa volucrum In mediis umbris hederarum, in sepibus ipsis, Ante escas, dulcesque dapes, mensasque fideles, Palladias inter baccas, gratosque corymbos, Frangunt hinc illinc ramo religata tenaci. GBO) The very syntax here is sinister. The sinewy nets tighten around the necks of the ingenuous birds at their tranquil repast (described in almost anthropomorphic terms: 'dulcesque dapes, mensasque fideles'). The delayed verb 'frangunt' breaks the idyll with its sudden violence. Angèli has clearly seasoned his poem to suit a savoury palate. The reader of Angèli's Cynegetica is expressly exhorted to brave and, as it were, epic action.34 In the Ixeuticon Uber, too, the reader will 33 Cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses, 15, 75-82. 34 The climax of the Cynegetica is the boar hunt, in which the reader-hero can prove his mettle in single combat against the most dangerous of opponente ('tantumque manu petis unus honorem'). Note the frequent second-person address to heighten the excite ment: Quod si vectus equo dubiam committere pugnam Forte paras, tantumque manu petis unus honorem, Quo res ipsa loco sese ostentatque, iubetque</page><page sequence="21">152 YASMIN HASKELL identify with the young fowler and imaginatively submit to his punish ing regime: At iuvenis, quem nulli usquam tardare labores, Nulla queunt gelidae remorari frigora brumae, Substructa e ferulis, ramisque arentibus ulmi Straminea latet usque casa... Insomnisque illic peragens noctemque diemque Expectat... (181, my emphasis) But how glorious is the victory which Angèli paints for our patient hero? If all goes to plan and he catches his ducks, he 'rushes forward at last, happy and giving thanks, bloodying his face and both hands in the slaughter of the wretched creatures' ('Accurrit tum demum auceps, &amp; laetus, ovansque I Ora manusque ambas miserarum in caede cruentai' ; 181, my emphasis). The reader-hero of the Ixeuticon Uber is necessarily less valorous than the protagonist of Angèli's Cynegetica·, he is hardly a fair match for his featherweight Opponent. There are no wide open spaces in the Ixeuticon for a manly hunter to traverse. There is less room to move. To be suc cessali the birdcatcher must sit tight and spy from the bushes. Effert is required but not obvious effort: Hos tarnen, atque alios magna occultare necesse est Arte dolos, absint tacitae vestigia fraudis: Absint &amp; culti ferro palique, sudesque, Et nusquam tanti Signum moliminis extet. (182, my emphasis) One is tempted to read this passage as a metaphor for the poet's labour, a neat didactic Variation on 'ars est celare artem'. The smaller compass of the poem, and the almost sedentary nature of the reader's projected work, have the effect of bringing Angèli's poetic artifice into sharper focus. The reader is invited to hunt for genre commonplaces and Providus adductas collo moderator habenas, Dum gladio ruis infestus, dum cernuus ense Terga fodis, saevumque manu iaculare verutum: Neu ventrem, neu crura feri sus concita rumpat, Neu iaculum summa ftxum tellure ruentis Transadigat costas, teque una stemat, equumque Purpureos late fundentem pectore rivos. (173)</page><page sequence="22">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALI AN RENAISSANCE 15 3 cunning allusions — even if Angèli does not leave so many, and such obvious, Virgilian tracks as Vida. Trae to its georgic roots, Angèli's poem includes an aetiological epyl lion. In the prelude there is a rather unsettling echo of Virgil's Corycian gardener: Nec desunt astus alii tarnen, innumeraeque Insidiae, unde avibus laeti vescamur inemptis,35 Et nulla omnino miseris loca fida sinamus. Non nemora, aut agros, non quae moderator aquarum Regna pater Neptunus habet: non aeris oras Ingentes voluit coniux Iovis aurea Iuno Perfugium praebere ollis, tutumque receptum. Omnia sunt infida, &amp; certo exposta periclo. (183-4, my emphasis) Despite the claim of the poem's eighteenth-century commentator, I can find no precedent in the 'Greci Novellieri' for the fiction which now unfolds.36 It seems more likely that Angèli's spiteful Jupiter is inspired by Virgil's 'pater ipse' who 'colendi haud facilem esse viam voluit' (Georgics, 1, 121-2). Why are there now no safe havens for the birds? Jupiter, having expelled Saturn from Olympus, was planning the destraction of his father's supporters and sad exile for the rest (of mankind?). They would have felt the full brant of his anger 'had they not been forewarned by the song and swift flight of the birds to seek mercy through gifts and burnt offerings ('ni voce prius, ni praepete penna I Alituum moniti, veniam per dona, per aras I Expeterent', 184). Not fully satisfied with this expiation, the sadistic god redirects his anger against the birds! The golden age comes to an end and man is forced to acquire his living through labour. Now he 'begins eagerly to attack domestic animals and wild beasts and to catch birds who, up to now, had deserved no such thing' ('Coepere in pecudes avidi saevire, ferasque I Et nil tale prius meritas captare volantes', ibid.). As for the birds: Nunc autem neque secreta sub valle quietes, Nec pennis variatus honos, nec in aere nidi 35 Cf. Georgics, 4, 133: 'dapibus mensas onerabat inemptis'. 36 G. P.

(185, my emphasis) This apparent condemnation of the 'blind love of prey and luxury, ouster of decency' is immediately followed by an admonition to return to our work. Such abrupt transitions are not infrequent in the Ixeuticon Uber. Angèli exhorts us to apply ourseives to the remaining arts ('Quare age, &amp; ad reliquas confer te providus artes, I Quae superarti: lentisque tenax inducere viscum I Funiculis, iunco e tenui, spartove, genistave, I Et capita ad stagni ripas religare memento', ibid.). The tension between the injunction to do and the injustice of what is to be done is never resolved. Angèli obliges us to be cowardly poisoners, to administer the grand tox ins of tragedy to pathetically tiny and unheroic victims: Est etiam, hirsutae passim qui grandia lappae, Quique venenato flaventia semina succo, Inter diversis immistas frugibus escas Spargat hyoscami, Graio quae nomine dieta est Herba: soporatam neque enim velocius ulla Vis agit exturbans mentem, &amp; vertigine tentat.

Hac quoque praeclari pulcherrima filia Solis Impatiens ira, odioque immanis &amp; ardens Succinxit Scyllae latrantibus inguina monstris. (186) Sometimes the moral blame is deflected on to the birdcatcher's accomplices. When revenge is taken on marauding partridges and the 'improbus anser',37 domestic geese are installed in the booby-trapped fields to Iure their hungry cousins: Praeterea medio in spatio prope retia, qua sunt Insidiae, ffaudesque omnes, eat unus &amp; alter Assimilis pennam, collumque domesticus anser, Voce vocans, strepituque feros. illi imbribus altis, Frigoribusque acti brumalibus ad sata culta Advenient, densoque implebunt agmine campum: Et proeul insidiis laeta inter farra volatum Sistentes ima fibras tellure revellent, Spem provisam anni...

Georgics, 1, 119.</page><page sequence="24">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALIAN RENAISSANCE 155 But the wild birds are canny and suspect that something is awry and must be lulled into confidence by your 'faithful Achates, companion in spoils and pleasing pains' ('fidus Achates... praedae socius, gratique labori'). Our 'fidus Achates' turns out to be something of a perfidus Achates. The young man approaches the flock from the rear, pretending to tili the earth, nonchalantly singing and talking to himself until he has driven his victims into the waiting nets. The bird-catcher's crafty com panion returns later as a 'noctisque comes, blandique laboris'. In this episode, which Stands out in the poem for its pathos and almost painterly quality, the birds are stunned by the torch-light of evening stalkers: Quandoquidem densas volucres dum forte per umbras Miratae splendorem oculis hausere, neque ullum Comminus ire vident, illic, ubi Sole sub undas Demerso placidae se composuere quieti, Stant immotae omnes, claroque a lumine nusquam Declinant, flectuntque aciem; tum tu ipse propinquos Siste gradus: noctisque comes, blandique laboris Circumiens verso reti superobruat agmen. (192) The stränge little night tragedy is followed by a comedy: 'Praeterea, si te laetae spectacula pugnae I Ulla trahunt, sequiturque animum iucunda voluptas, I Dum mores, astusque acres miraris, &amp; iras I Ali tuum...' (192). We seem to have been transported back to the scene of Virgil's fighting bees (Georgics, 4, 67ff.), but instead of Standing back to observe and marvel at the spectacle of Nature, Angèli asks us to make our own entertainment, to intervene : Continuo instituenda tibi multa arte volucris, Privatimque domi cultu educenda frequenti In quoscumque dolos, nimirum ut retibus adstet Assidens, aliasque in caeca pericula voce Alliciat... The treacherous little bird will challenge other males to fight him. One by one they will succumb and become entangled in the trapper's net. Their motives for joining battle are impure, but their methods, at least, are honourable; they are ashamed to rush on the enemy in battle formation: 'Impulsi stimulis, atraque libidine caeci I Accurrunt non una omnes. pudet agmine facto I Irruere, atque hostem non aequo invadere marte' (193). The methods of the birdcatcher who has trained a iemale</page><page sequence="25">156 YASMIN HASKELL 'Mata Hari' bird are not so honourable. The whole flock, following their leader, will be lured to their doom: At vero tantas fuerit si foemina fraudes Docta tibi, maculasque inter ponatur inanes, Ut canat, &amp; misere tamquam captiva queratur, Ipse salax voce audita dux agminis ibit Impatiens, circumque piagas errabit apertas. Nec prius absistet, quam rara in retia sese Induerit, secumque gregem male sanus amicum Perdiderit... But if the bird-catcher is licensed to dissimulate, there are, in the end, no prizes for the bird who double-crosses his master: Quas inter tibi si quis erit, qui stridere acutum Turdus amet, hunc tu cerebro comp escere fracto Ne dubita, iubet iste alios discedere longe Proditor, &amp; tutas cursum contendere ad oras. (200, my emphasis) By focussing on these — to us — disquieting passages I do not wish to suggest that the Ixeuticon Uber was ever meant as a veiled indictment of bird-catching. It would, of course, be anachronistic to impute an anxiety about the injustice of bloodsports to Angèli and his contemporary readers. What is remarkable about this poem, I submit, is the attempt to imitate not only the language, but also the tonai light and shadow of Virgil's Geor gics. Angèli has perhaps sought to give us a flavour of Virgil's 'labor improbus', to recreate something of, e. g., the sinister comparison of agri culture to war in book 2 ('ut saepe ingenti bello...', 279-83), or to capture the notes of the bereaved nightingale whose nest has been robbed by the 'durus arator' in 4. 512-13. But to what extent does Angèli's Variation on the Virgilian 'culture and cruelty' theme remain within the realms of inter textuality? On one level, as I have already hinted, that is precisely where it is located. Where Vida's silk-worker weaves pretty scenes, Angèli's bird-catcher weaves clever traps. For both, arguably, this weaving is metapoetic, highlighting the poet's generically self-reflexive work. Conclusion To return to the questions posed in my introduction, how 'serious' is the sub-genre of Renaissance Latin recreational georgic? If the serious</page><page sequence="26">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE ITALI AN RENAISSANCE 157 didactic poet — e.g. Lucretius, Virgil, Manilius — asks us to think or to do, what are we to make of Pontano's Instructions, in the opening lines of his seminai De hortis Hesperidum, to relax?38 Instead of an invoca tion to the gods or Muses, Pontano extends an invitation to the nymphs: 'Quo solem vitetis, iniqui &amp; syderis aestum, I Hac mecum placida fessae requiescite in umbra I Gratorum nemorum...' (1505, 138r).39 From the outset, the character of the poem seems to be more bucolic than georgic. Now is the time for repose and pleasure: Oda nunc, hortique iuvent, genialiaque arva, Quaeque &amp; Amalpheae foecundant littora sylvae Citrigenum decus, Hesperidum monumenta sororum, Deliciae quoque &amp; ipsa tuae. Peneia Phoebum Delectant Tempe, fratemaque pectora Lauri. (138v, my emphasis) We have seen that the physical labour required of the reader of Vida's and Milio's poems is largely effaced — or, at least, displaced on to the serving class.40 In Vida's Bombyces, especially, it is the poet's labour which is put on show; his ironie treatment of a subject 'abhorrent to the Muses' seems to constitute a virtuosic display of, if anything, difficulté vaincue. On the other hand, we are not necessarily dealing with parody, of which Vida's Scacchia Ludus would be a more obvious example.41 38 Ease of work is a recurrent theme in poems of this sub-genre, e.g. Giustolo: 'Sed labor is facilis: pueri innuptaeque puellae I Per ludum id peragunt...' (12); Valeriano: 'Qua vero hanc cultus Milacem ratione gubernes, I Ne faciles pigeat quemquam tentare labores; I Quid sit opus facto expediam, laetusque docebo', and then (rewriting Georgics, 1, 121-2): 'Nam pater, omne bonum qui dat mortalibus, ipse I Hanc facilem esse viam Milaci concessit' (59). 39 The Muse Urania, having accompanied Pontano on a long journey through the cos mos in his astrological poem of that name, appears now almost as an avatar of Venus. She is to be greeted with 'rore Idalio &amp; Syrio... odore' (138v). 40 In Giustolo's De croci cultu the aristocratic addressee is replaced by an anonymous rusticus, addressed either in the third person: Tum levibus sulcis gemino locet ordine, putrì Exsaturetque fimo, terraque obducat inerti Rusticus, ci. facili perlustret turgida rostro Caerulei paritura decus mox semina floris. or in the second: Praedia nam revocant rediviva consita messe, Et celeri rapienda manu nova germina florum Surgere multiplici cogunt te, rustice, culmo. (10, 13; my emphasis) 41 See: Game ofChess: Marco Girolamo Vida's Scacchia Ludus, with English Verse Translation and the Text of the Three Earlier Versions, ed. Mario A. Di Cesare (Nieuwkoop: De Graaf, 1975).</page><page sequence="27">15 8 YASMIN HASKELL The mock-didactic genre of Vida's chess poem is clearly signalled in its opening lines: 'Ludimus effigiem belli, simulataque veris I Praelia, buxo acies fictas, et ludicra regna' (my emphasis). That is a poem about an unreal world, a game, and one which the poet does not undertake to teach in any systematic way. In contrast, the recreational georgic poems dis cussed in this paper are ostensibly about the 'real' world, and offer fac tual advice which is generally sound, practical and rationally organised.42 Moreover, before we conclude that our Renaissance georgic poets make no extra-textual demands on their readers — that the prodesse in these poems is merely a pretext for the delectare of classical imitation — we should be mindful of the nature of their original audience. Such poems are not simply dedicated to, but, in an even more exclusive sense, custom-made for aristocratic ladies and gentlemen. The fictional physi cal labour must be carefully moderated to remain within the bounds of social decorum. There can be no question of the addressees of such poems being obliged to work. But this fact highlights a nice paradox; the 'labour' projected in the Renaissance recreational georgic is class-, even gender-specific, and thus, in theory, more imaginatively accessible by its target audience than that of Virgil's Georgics. If Virgil's readers are not the subsistence farmers he instructs and describes in the Geor gics, Vida, Milio and Angèli are holding up a mirrar to the real — or at least, potential — leisure pursuits of their addressee-actors 43 The work 42 Not always, admittedly. Carried away by his love for Virgil, Vida advocates the technique of bougonia for generating silkworms (2, 332 -43) ! On the other hand, an eigh teenth-century translator of Bombyces, the Reverend Samuel Pullein, could write : '... and tho' Virgil's Geòrgie on bees may have more grandeur and colouring in it than this on the silkworm, yet it must be allowed that Vida has adhered more strictly to his subject, and given more accurate and true Instruction' (Dublin, 1750, unnumbered preface). Pullein Supplements the poem with a page of minor corrections and practical tips; one has the impression that he — and Vida — knew quite well what they were talking about. 43 In De milacis cultura, Valeriano begs his addressee, Alessandro de' Medici, not to spum his 'tenuem... Musam, I Si magnis vaeuus curis quandoque gravatum I Exhilarare animum studiis levioribus optas'. The poet reminisces about the warrior's youth, at which time he had introduced him — 'dux vester eram' — to the study of the Muses. Note that the activities which 'pleased, please and will always please' include gardening and hunt ing — the very subjects of Renaissance recreational georgic: tu seria toto Pectore condebas, tu lusum &amp; amoena iocorum Colloquia, haud rigido aspernatus corde, probabas, Non aberat Studium honorum, non cura rapacum Accipitrumque canumque, &amp; equorum: haec omnia rede Et modice placuere, placent, semperque placebunt. (58)</page><page sequence="28">LATIN GEORGIC POETRY OF THE IT ALI AN RENAISSANCE 159 described in these Renaissance poems may look very much like play, but it is work which the poet, no matter how tactfully, asks his reader to do. I should qualify the 'work described', because it is precisely here that we can draw a line between the Renaissance, and a certain, influential, modem reading of didactic poetry. Hegel, in his Aesthetics, barely dis tinguished didactic from descriptive poetry.44 Closer to our time, one is reminded of Patrick Wilkinson's identification of the Georgics as the first descriptive poem in Western literature: I believe that Virgil carne to realise through reading Lucretius that an accumulation of detailed observations, however commonplace in themselves, may compose a great panoramic picture, and that the framework for this could be a didactic treatise. It is not the imperative verb but the object that is significant; and the total impression tran scends the sum of the contributors. The Georgics is, in fact, the first poem in all literature in which description may be said to be the chief raison d'ètre and source of pleasure 45 This does not seem to be a Renaissance understanding of Virgil, at least as revealed in the Renaissance Latin recreational georgic. Our poets, like Virgil, are still soliciting a certain amount of activity — not just Observation46 — from their readers. We may never know, of course, whether an individuai poet's Instructions were actually put into practice.47 I would like to suggest, however, that the very possibility of reader action — the scope afforded by the poem for the reader's (at least) imaginative collaboration in its hypothetical 'work' — may have been as important to the aesthetic success of this sub-genre in the Renaissance as those quali ties which we conventionally designate as 'literary'. Newnham College Cambridge, CB3 9DF United Kingdom 44 '[Didactic poetry] can seldom get along without sketching external situations and individuai phenomena.... As in the didactic poem so too, therefore, in descriptive poetry episodes enter as enlivening decoration, especially the sketching of moving feelings, of sweet melancholy....'

A criticai survey (Cambridge, 1969), ρ. 11. 46 Description certainly plays a key role in many eighteenth-century didactics — but that is another story. See e.g. D. L. Durling, Geòrgie Tradition in English Poetry (New York, 1935) and W. P. Jones, The Rhetoric of Science: A Study of Scientific Ideas and Imagery in Eighteenth Century English Poetry (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1966). 47 Samuel Pullein, at least, had no doubt that Vida's Bombyces 'did, in his time, prompt many persons of fortune and distinction to encourage the silken manufacture in severa! parts where it had not been introduced' (see above, n. 42).</page></plain_text>
