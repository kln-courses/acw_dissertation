THE AMAZON, EASTERN BRAZIL, AND THE ORINOCO VENEZUELA. Territorio Federal Amazonas. Al- berta Zucchi (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas) reported that in February 1986 research was begun on the evolution and interrelationship of human settlement on the white and black water rivers at the confluence of the Orinoco and Atabapo rivers, Territorio Federal Amazonas, Venezuela. The project has the following objectives: 1) Characterize the dif- ferent prehistoric systems of human settlement along a stretch of the Orinoco and Atabapo, while contrasting them with the post-contact and contemporary situa- tion. 2) Characterize the interaction between systems of settlement of the two types of rivers through time. 3) Determine the mechanisms and the level of inte- gration of the systems in both zones in order to define a possible macro-system. 4) Determine the underlying factors of the changes that are observed both in the local systems as well as in the macro-systems. The project will continue for two years. In addition, the processing of the data from two archaeological surveys completed between the years 1976 and 1977 continues. COLOMBIA. Warwick Bray (London University Institute of Archaeology), Linda Cheetham (Pitt Rivers Museum), and Benjamin Yepes (FINARCO) visited a much-damaged contact-period site near Puerto Inirida on the Inirida River close to the point where it joins the Orinoco at the Venezuela frontier. The cemetery had yielded iron objects and olive shells. Sherds from the adjacent settlement included corrugated, incised, brushed wares, and mat-impressed griddles. GUYANA. The Centro de Investigaciones Indi- genas de Puerto Rico, Inc. sponsored an ethnoarchaeo- logical expedition to study the Waiwai Indians along the Upper Essequibo River in southern Guyana, during June and July 1985. Peter Roe, the Project Director, recorded a series of origin myths and star constellations as part of his continuing research into lowland South American cosmological organization. Peter Siegel made a detailed plan view map of the village in order to investigate the archaeological correlations of the social, demographic, behavioral, and architectural organiza- tion of the community. Preliminary results indicate that there is distinctive spatial partitioning within the village along several clearly observed dimensions. Within the village there are several clearly observed dimensions. Within the village there are several Wapi- shana families, and their house compounds are found solely around the settlement periphery. Further, among the Waiwai there is prestige/power differentiation, which is architecturally/spatially manifested by the amount of open plaza associated with the particular families. The more prestigious the family, the more plaza (pow- er) space is available to the family. Research currently in progress is quantifying the aerial breakdown of the village in terms of different structure types, different use-areas of the village, and demographic organization in order to elucidate behaviorally meaningful patterns and relations that potentially will be observable ar- chaeologically in the tropical lowlands of South Amer- ica. BRAZIL. Amapd. Cesar Ulisses V. Verissimo, Dirse Clara Kern, and Edithe da Silva Pereira (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi) carried out salvage work at 175</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY AP-MA-03, the Pacoval site, located on the Amazon River in the Pacoval district northeast of the city of Macapa. Geophysical mapping showed the presence of anomalies that could be tested archaeologically. Ex- cavations revealed burials and postholes. Burials in- cluded anthropomorphic urns, simple urns, plates, and ax blades and a nutcracker stone. Burial urns were either placed in semicircular arrangements or in straight rows. The "terra-preta" of the site shows that the site was a habitation area as well as a burial ground. The Pa- coval material shows certain similarities to the Ma- zagao phase identified by Betty Meggers and Clifford Evans in 1957. Similarities include secondary burial, urn form, the practice of ceremonial burning in the urns, and the slight depth of occupational refuse. Two aspects of the Pacoval material do not relate to the Mazagao phase. Unlike the Mazagao phase, Pacoval pottery contains crushed sherd temper and urns tend to be buried in regular patterns. Pard. Anna Roosevelt (American Museum) com- pleted a second season at Aterro dos Bichos on Marajo Island. This Marajoara phase site is a 2-ha artificial mound more than 4 m high, overlooking the Goiapi tributary of the Arari River in central Marajo. Geo- physical survey by magnetometer, electromagnetic conductivity, electrical resistivity, and ground-probing radar revealed aspects of the stratigraphy and layout of the site. Thirty excavations tested the survey results, reveal- ing numerous magnetic anomalies of low conductivity to be clusters of 6 to 12 baked clay cook stoves with some 20 large houses with thick earth floors. Areas of intermediate conductivity and few magnetic anomalies were garbage fill, rich in decorated and plain pottery, carbonized plant remains, and faunal bone. High-con- ductivity areas of few magnetic anomalies at the per- ipheries of the site were found to be monumental earth- en walls more than 3 m tall and equally wide, perhaps fortifications or retaining walls. Rare radar anomalies of high resistivity were recent intrusions of natural or human origin. No burials were found either by survey or excavation, indicating that the urn cemetery exca- vated in the 1870s has been eroded away by the river. The large houses may have held several families, with one stove to each family. Houses and stoves were main- tained for long periods, indicating permanent, rather than sporadic occupations. The grouped stoves suggest communal cooking, sometimes customary in matri- local communities in the Amazon. Although floors were kept free of objects, the stoves contain simple cooking bowls. Decorated pottery found in the garbage fill in- cludes many types known from burials. The fill is sev- eral meters thick and will provide a detailed chronol- ogy. Spatial distinctions in the pottery may reflect differences in sexual roles or rank. The results demonstrate the utility of the survey and excavation methods. The well-preserved stratigraphy features artifacts and biological remains, and the spa- tial distribution of artifacts reveals information on the composition of the community. Future work will focus on the garbage fill, the earth walls, house layouts, and cemeteries in the vicinity. Because Marajoara skeletons are usually well-preserved, excavation of a cemetery is of high priority for the future. Much information about socio-political and economic differentiation should be revealed. A. C. Roosevelt is directing the project, with funding from NSF and CNPQ. B. Bevan of Geosight and J. S. Lourenco of the University of Parf, directed the sur- vey with W. Sauck and G. das Virgenes. F. Mueller of Hunter College and the American Museum, C. Mi- randa, F. Costa, M. Imazio da Silveira, C. and M. Magalhaes, C. Senna, D. Kern of the Museo Goeldi, and C. Fitzgerald, formerly of Hunter College, have also participated in the project. The work was greatly aided by the Cardoso family, who own the site. Planned future work in collaboration with the Museu Goeldi may include comparable investigations at San- tarem city and the Taperinha shell mound at the mouth of the Tapaj6s River. Fernanda de Arafjo Costa (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi) reported that survey work was begun in the region of Porteira falls on the middle Trombetas in the northeast of the state where a hydroelectric dam will soon be built. Participants in the work included Edithe da Silva Pereira and Cristina Fernandes Senna (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi). The survey included the sec- tion of the Trombetas River that will be inundated below the juncture of the Mapuera and Cachorro rivers and above the Porteira Falls. This is an area where the prehistory is unknown. Work already carried out has revealed 10 sites: seven open sites evidenced by ce- ramic material, two cave sites with pictographs, and one site with petroglyphs. Ceramic material compares to the Kunduri and Santarem styles located respec- tively on the lower courses of the Nhamunda, Trom- betas, and lower Tapajos. These styles are well known for their beautiful and elaborate art. In the south of the state of Para, between the rivers Itacaiinas and Parauapebas, Daniel F. Fr6is Lopes, Marcos Pereira Magalhaes, and Maura Imazio da Sil- veira (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi) continue to work on the Ferro Carajas project, which is financed by the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce under an agreement with the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas and the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi. Environmental studies have shown significant heterogeneity of soil and water types, and plant and fish resources are abundant. Fieldwork has revealed 47 sites in the valleys of the two rivers. These are usually found in areas 2.80 to 20 m above the highest river level and 20 to 300 m from the river's edge. Of the 47 sites studied, 16 are in "terrapreta," 16 in dark soil, and 15 are in yellow or red soil. Sites in the black soil average 60 cm in depth and contain a greater quantity of cultural material, while sites in the dark soil are seldom deeper than 30 cm and contain fewer artifacts. Sites found on red or yellow soils rarely exceed 20 cm in depth and contain fewer cultural re- mains. All the sites are elongated ellipses with their longer axis parallel to the river. Site areas vary from 40,000 m2 to 112.5 m2. Ceramic vessels are tempered with crushed rock and sand and are greatly varied in form (from globular to carinated, with flat, rounded or conical bases and di- rect, open or closed mouths). Undecorated pottery pre- dominates, but in order of popularity are red slip, in- cising, scraping, roulette stamping, painting, white slip, 176 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH coiling, brushing, and engraving. Painting is found as frequently on the inside as on the outside. Surfaces are frequently polished. The excavators recognize a simi- larity between the ceramics of this area and Tupigua- rani ceramics found in southern Brazil. Of rare occur- rence are modeled and incised punctate decoration, which is believed to be more characteristic of the ce- ramic traditions of the Amazon. Stone artifacts are relatively scarce though source material is present. Scrapers, grinders, nutcrackers, and polished or par- tially polished stone axes are found. Ax blades are most frequently "T"-shaped. Eight '4C dates range from 1670 ? 80 B.P. to 440 + 55 B.P. (SI 6274-SI 6281). Characteristics of the sites and the relative frequency of ceramic types have led the researchers to infer a gradual depopulation and deculturation of the area caused by unidentified factors. The occupation is be- lieved to have been characteristically Tupiguarani. Piaui. Niede Guidon (Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales) and Silvia Maranca (Universidade de Sao Paulo, Museu Paulista) reported on work car- ried out on the Projeto Franco-Brasileiro de Arqueo- logia ao Piaui. Much research has been undertaken since 1970 under the direction of Nirde Guidon in the Sao Raimundo Nonato region of southeastern Piaui. More than 200 rockshelter sites have been discovered, and many of these have painted walls. Many very early sites in this area are important for understanding the peopling of the New World. One of these, Toca do Boqueirao do Sitio da Pedra Furada, has been dated to more than 30,000 years by a long series of consistent '4C samples, and is the most ancient archaeological site known for South America. Four phases have been defined. The earliest, Pedra Furada I, consists of a lithic industry of pebbles and flakes with three or four convergent chips taken from the ends. Unifacial flaked tools are most characteristic. The percentage of retouched pieces is very low. Other tools include choppers, chopping-tools, denticulates, burins, and flaked tools of quartz and quartzite. Large hearths are found in the earliest phase. Two 14C dates for the hearths of phase 1 have been provided, 31,700 + 830 B.P. (GIF 6652) and 32,160 + 1,000 B.P. (GIF 6653). Nine radiocarbon dates for phase 2 range between 23,500 B.P. and 28,860 B.P. (GIF 5398, 5648, 5962, 5963, 6147, 6158, 6308, 6309). One 4C date of 21,400 ? 400 B.P. (GIF 6160) from phase 3 is consistent with the other dates. A fragment of red painted wall of Pedra Furada phase 4 was used to edge a fireplace that has been dated to 17,000 ? 400 B.P. (GIF 5397). Other sites, such as Toca do Caldeirao do Rodrigues and Toca do Sitio do Meio, for which dates range from 18,600 + 600 B.P. (GIF 5406) to 14,300 + 400 B.P. (GIF 5399), confirm that an ancient popu- lation inhabited the area. The large quantity of manufactured objects and food remains will provide much evidence on the way of life of these early occupants. Shelters were apparently oc- cupied in a sporadic way by small groups of hunters. The materials most widely distributed 30,000 years ago were quartz and quartzite; 10,000 years later the principal material became flint, which allowed the practice of retouching by pressure flaking. The pro- duction of very finely flaked and chipped tools with delicately retouched edges became common. Biface points and blades appeared only after 7,000 years ago. One particular characteristic of the culture that oc- cupied the zone is the practice of painting the walls of rockshelters. Pieces of fallen painted wall are found in situ within the hearths of this earliest phase; how- ever, no style can be defined from the small fragments. Numerous fragments of ochre found within the hearths may indicate that the material was heated to obtain different colors of red applied to the walls and ceilings of the rockshelters. Graves found in open areas within the shelter of Toca do Paraguaio show that the pre- historic hunters buried their dead in some caves as early as 8670 ? 120 B.P. (MC 2480). Bahia. Alan Bryan and Ruth Gruhn (University of Alberta) are now finishing final reports on excavations carried out in six limestone caves or rockshelters in the caatinga zone of the townships of Central and Xique- Xique, Bahia, 1983-1984 and 1985. The Projecto Cen- tral is the overall responsibility of Profa. Maria Beltrao (Museo Nacional do Brasil). Two caves, Toca dos Bu- zios and Toca de Manoel Latao, yield simple stone and bone artifacts in clear association with bones of extinct fauna, indicating a Pleistocene age, although '4C dates could not be obtained on the highly mineralized bone. In another cavern, Toca da Gameleira, stone artifacts occurred in the same strata as fragmented bones of giant ground sloth, but the deposits were colluvial and mixed. Direct association of humans and sloth could not be demonstrated. The Abrigo do Pilao, a large rockshelter, contained 50 cm of finely stratified ash and silt deposits with abundant artifacts of stone and riv- erine mussel shell. A '4C date of 9390 ? 90 B.P. (Beta 10017) was obtained on charcoal from a basal level of the ash and silt zone, and a few stone artifacts were found in underlying reddish silt. Plain ceramics oc- curred in the upper 10 cm at the Abrigo do Pilao, associated with radiocarbon dates of 800 ? 60 B.P. (Beta 10016) and 860 ? 60 B.P. (Beta 10604). Abun- dant bones of medium-sized mammals, and shells of edible terrestrial gastropods suggest a foraging econo- my throughout the history of the site. The Abrigo da Lesma, a small rockshelter, was occupied in the late Holocene, with the earliest '4C date, 2400 + 70 B.P. (Beta 8673). Plain ceramics occurred in the upper levels of this site, dated 940 ? 50 B.P. (Beta 8672). The Toca do Cosmos, a rockshelter featuring rock art with spec- tacular celestial motifs, produced a date of 3230 ? 210 B.P. (Beta 13929) on charcoal from the lower occu- pation level at 90 cm depth; plain ceramics were found in the upper 10 cm. Shells of riverine mussels were abundant in the upper levels of this site; the source, the Rio Verde, is less than 2 km distant. Together, the Central area sites demonstrate the persistence of a very simple lithic industry, featuring small utilized or min- imally retouched cores or flakes of chert, quartz, quartzite, or limestone, from the late Pleistocene to protohistoric times. Wesley Hurt (Indiana University) reported on the 1984 excavations near Central, Bahia, Brazil. Labo- ratory analysis has been completed on the artifacts collected in the excavation of 15 rockshelters and cav- erns in the limestone formations. This project was one phase of a long-time archaeological program co-spon- 177</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY sored by the Museu Nacional of Brazil and directed by Maria Conceicao de M. C. Beltrao. The sites were se- lected on the basis of their potential to reveal how prehistoric people survived in a semi-arid habitat char- acterized by frequent, long-time droughts. For exam- ple, at the time of the 1984 field project, no rain had fallen in the area for five years. As a guide for the project, it was postulated that in regions with this type of climate, people survived by exploiting only the minimum resources of the area, that is, those that were present even during times of drought. In contrast, present day inhabitants in the region have a large population that subsists on agri- culture and stock raising that are only feasible during years of rain; in periods of drought, many starve to death and others migrate to the coastal cities. The laboratory analysis of the material collected in the 1984 excavations, and the distribution and fre- quency of the sites support the hypothesis that both the preceramic and ceramic cultures of the Central area exploited only the minimum resources of the entire region. Only rockshelters and caverns were inhabited. Bones found in the strata with other refuse were almost entirely from small animals such as armadillos, rep- tiles, marsupials, amphibians, and small birds. Shells of the giant land snail were also common, but these are scarce during drought and therefore do not support the hypothesis. On the other hand, large animals, such as deer, peccaries, anteaters, capybaras, tapirs, and rheas, that would have had a more difficult time sur- viving during long periods of droughts, are not rep- resented in the kitchen middens. This differential ex- ploitation of locally occurring animals is also evident in the minute size of the projectile points found. In addition to these points made of bone, the prehistoric cultures were characterized by a wide variety of scrap- ers made of quartzite or shells of the freshwater mussels that occur in the Rio Verde. Choppers and percussion- flaked axes were also common. The ceramic cultures retained these small tools but added mullers and ground diorite axes. In the most recent ceramic period, wood arrowheads and painted pottery were new additions. Although these ceramic cultures may have practiced agriculture, no such evidence has been found to date even though conditions for preservation in some of the upper strata of several sites is excellent. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz (Instituto Anchietano de Pes- quisas) reported on continued progress of the Programa Arqueol6gico de Goias being carried out in the south- east of the state of Bahia in the Sao Francisco basin. This project is being carried out by the Universidade Catolica de Goifs with collaboration of the Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas and the Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. The research is coordinated by Pedro Ignacio Schmitz and Altair Sales Barbosa. In the for- ested area around the municipality of Coribe, several surface sites of the Itaparica tradition (estimated to be between 11,000 and 8,500 years old) were revisited. In the thorny forest area around the municipality of Santa Maria da Vit6ria, Santana dos Brejos and part of Coribe, work was continued on cave sites with rock paintings of the Sio Francisco tradition. One limestone cave in the municipality of Coribe revealed a long stratigraphic sequence of Pleistocene dates. Widely spaced strata contain vegetable ash and land snails. '4C dates of 26,970 + 570 B.P. (SI 6293) and 26,000 ? 620 B.P. (SI 6292) were obtained from samples of land snails. Carbon samples from the same strata, but from a trench where the strata were less compact, revealed the following dates: 21,090 + 420 B.P. (SI 6750), 18,570 ? 130 B.P. (SI 6751),and 16,200 ? 290 B.P. (SI 6752). Pedro Ignacio Schmitz believes the samples correctly date the levels; however, he states that the cultural material in the ash is practically absent. A blade industry in the upper levels of the same cave has been dated by a sequence of six radiocarbon samples: 9110 ? 100 B.P. (SI 6748), 8880 ? 90 B.P. (SI 5563), 7707 ? 115 B.P. (SI 6747), 6815 + 80 B.P. (SI 6749), 6805 ? 90 B.P. (SI 6747), 1985 ? 85 B.P. (SI 6290). At the surface of the occupation, material relating to the Una ceramic tradition has been dated at 955 ? 85 B.P. (SI 6291). In the lowest levels of another cave site, artifacts of the Itaparica tradition have been found for the first time in a thorny forest area. A '4C date of 6520 ? 100 B.P. (SI 6953) is more recent than the dates for the forest version of this tradition. It appears that the tra- dition spread into the thorny forest from the forested areas. Some Tupiguarani sites of the Coribe phase were also studied in the more humid areas. Goias. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz also reports that the Caiaponia project, in the southeast of Goias, is coming to an end. Surface sites with blade industries of the Itaparica tradition were estimated to date between 11,000 and 8,500 years ago, but the oldest '4C date obtained for the material, 4455 + 155 B.P. (SI 6743), suggests the tradition is significantly younger than pre- viously estimated. At about A.D. 1 an undefined ce- ramic tradition begins to appear in the caves. After 1020 ? 65 B.P. (SI 6744) horticulturists of the Mos- samedes phase of the Aratu tradition begin to appear. Mato Grosso do Sul. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz re- ports that in 1985, the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul began a cooperative project with the Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas and the Universi- dade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos to study the cultural history of Mato Grosso do Sul. The program is com- posed of four projects, each of which covers about 20,000 km2. Two projects cover the highlands in the central part of the state, while the other two survey the Pantanal. The first archaeological work was carried out in the northeast of the state in the high valley of the Sucurii River by Silvia Moehlecke Cope (Instituto An- chietano de Pesquisas) and Jos&amp; Luiz Lorenz Silva (Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul). Five caves with petroglyphs and pictographs have been found. A sequence similar to one 100 km away, at Serran6polis, was found. In the deepest beds, the Ita- parica tradition is found. In the intermediate layer, the Serran6polis tradition occurs, and in the upper levels, ceramics are found. Two '4C dates, 7430 ? 65 B.P. (SI 6955) and 6710 ? 100 B.P. (SI 6956), are more recent than dates for the same tradition in Goias. Irmhild Wiist (Universidade Catolica de Goias) re- ports that in July 1986, the ethnoarchaeological project in the Sao Lourenco river basin, Mato Grosso, contin- ued in Bororo territory. Renate B. Viertler (Universi- 178 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH dade de Sao Paulo) is the collaborating anthropologist. Ethnographic studies are directed towards population fluctuation within communities, hierarchies within vil- lages, and networks of social and economic relation- ships. Individual life histories are the base of the re- search, but archaeological techniques have assisted in understanding the development of Bororo-type villages in certain ecological niches. Political influences that have determined the development of clans in certain territorial areas of the Bororo in pre-Columbian times are becoming better understood. Archaeological research carried out along the Rio Vermelho, tributary of the Sao Lourenco, has revealed 78 sites. Of these, 13 are rockshelters with petroglyphs, one is an open site with petroglyphs of life-sized an- thropomorphic figures, three are open-air lithic sites, 35 are ceramic sites with material that can be attributed to the Una tradition, six are sites with Tupiguarani tradition ceramics of the painted sub-tradition, and 20 sites can be attributed to the ancient Bororo. The most ancient occupation of the area is only rep- resented by plano-convex lithic remains of the Para- naiba phase. Petroglyphs with geometric, anthropo- morphic, and zoomorphic representations are most recent, but cannot be attributed to a single phase. Pet- roglyphs are occasionally found associated with ceram- ic materials. Uru tradition sites are characterized by large circular villages up to 500 m in diameter with one or two rows of houses. At least part of the subsis- tence was probably based on the cultivation of manioc, as is indicated by large flat griddles found in the refuse. There is an apparent break between these ceramic using groups and an occupation of the area by the ethnographic Bororo that are characterized by a "quad- ro tecnologico" (square technology) and a completely distinct system of subsistence in which maize plays a key role. Only at the archaeological site MT-SL-11, identified by Bororo informants as the location of final consolidation of the dual clan system, are ceramics of the two traditions (Uru and Bororo) found together. Along with other studies, this project will test the hy- pothesis that the ethnographic Bororo were formed by the fusion of the two traditions. Parana. Igor Chmyz, Joao Carols Gomes Chmyz, and Eliane Maria Sganzerla (Centro de Estudos e Pes- quisas Arqueol6gicas) conducted an extension course in order to begin salvage work in the area of the Rio Passauna dam, in the municipalities of Araucaria and Campo Largo. Within the 10 km2 of area where salvage work is being carried out, two distinct environments have been recognized: 1) the alluvial plane or the var- zea of the Passauna River, a tributary to the right mar- gin of the Iguacu; and 2) the low hills of Precambrian origin. Fifteen sites have been located. Sites PR-CT- 43, 46, 48, and 55 proved to be preceramic sites of the Umbu tradition. Artifacts of this tradition include pro- jectile points and scrapers of quartz. Similar material has been dated to 4000 B.P. in adjacent areas. Two ceramic sites (PR-CT-52 and 53) relate to the Itarar&amp; tradition, which may pertain to the Xokleng, a Ge speaking people. The ceramic vessels are of small di- mensions with generally smooth surfaces, but occa- sionally red-slipped or paddle-stamped. Other sites with ceramics (PR-CT-42, 50, 51, and 54) pertain to the Tupiguarani tradition. Tupiguarani sites are of large size. Three elliptical areas at PR-CT-54 defined the outlines of three house sites. Ceramic materials showed smoothing, corrugation, brushing, and painting. Ground stone axes, pestles, manos, and one possible labret were found. A final neo-Brazilian occupation was evidenced at PR-CT-41, 44, 45, 47, and 49. Sao Paulo. Dorath Pinto Uch6a (Instituto de Pre- hist6ria of the Universidade de Sao Paulo) reported on work carried out on the coastal sites of the state. The Companhia Sideruirgica Paulista SA. invited Dorath Pinto Uch6a and Caio Del Rio Garcia (Instituto de Pr6-hist6ria) to carry out excavations in the sambaquis of Casqueirinho Island. Two distinct stages of human occupation were revealed. 14C dates for the earliest stage were obtained from four of the sambaquis (Cosipa 1-4): Cosipa 1 4210 + 90 B.P. (Gif 6778) Cosipa 2 1180 ? 60 B.P. (Gif6779) Cosipa 3 3790 + 110 B.P. (Gif 6780) Cosipa 4 2590 + 80 B.P. (Gif 6781) The latter stage of occupation consists of a lime kiln built by the Portuguese in the seventeenth or eighteenth century. Other archaeological work was carried out in the Baixada Santista, adjacent to Casqueirinho Island, and in the valley of Ribeira and the Baixada Cananeia- Iguape. Rio Grande do Sul. Silvia Moehlecke Cop&amp; (Uni- versidade de Sao Paulo) finished her dissertation, "As- pectos da Ocupacao Pre-colonial no Vale do Rio Ja- guarao, RS." The dissertation refers to hunters who lived in the area of the municipality of Erval, at the frontier between Brazil and Uruguay during the last two or three millennia. These hunters developed into the ceramic using peoples of the Vieira tradition. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz reports that the Instituto An- chietano de Pesquisas, the Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos, and the Museu Arqueol6gico do Rio Grande do Sul continue to excavate the site RS-C-43 in the municipality of Ivoti. A sequence of hunting phases (Capivara, Umbu, and Itapui) of the Umbu tradition were found in the previous year. With the extension of the excavations to include 45 m2, sufficient data have been found to shed new light on the evolution of hunting traditions in the south of Brazil during the last 10,000 years. URUGUAY. Antonio Taddei, Wilder Melgar, and J. E. Baeza (Centro de Estudios Arqueol6gicos) report that before the filling of the lake formed by the Salto Grande Dam, a three-period sequence was established. Excavations were carried out at the Aruera and Garzas sites of Isla de Arriba and the Norte site of Isla del Medio. The most recent component was found from the surface to a depth of 60 cm, and consisted of an atypical flake and core industry of quartzite associated with three types of ceramic materials. Tupiguarani type is believed to be most recent, but close in age to Para- naense type ceramics. Salto Grande type material, con- sisting of smooth and incised wares, is found through- out the first 60 cm and is the most widespread type in the Cuenca del Plata. Three dates have been obtained for the ceramic occupation: 2350 + 80 B.P. (SI 2672) 179</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY for 50 to 60 cm level, 2370 ? 80 B.P. (SI 2673) for the 40 to 50 cm level, and 1140 ? 100 B.P. (SI 2674) for the 30 to 40 cm level. An aceramic component found between 70 and 90 cm contained scrapers, knives, and blades of quartzite. No dates are available for this aceramic component, nor for the oldest one. The oldest component has been defined by the use of chert and agate and is distin- guished by the presence of shouldered, stemmed points and small bifaces. Excavations were also carried out by the C.E.A. in collaboration with the Museo de Historia Natural de Montevideo and the Intendencia de Tacuarembo (Mu- seo del Indio yel Gaucho) in the Department of Ta- cuaremb6 at the site of Yaguari. An aceramic complex with flakes of chert and quartzite, bolo stones, and grinding stones was found associated with a human skeleton. A radiocarbon determination obtained from the 34 to 40 cm level is 3170 ? 50 B.P. (SI 6495). Excavations at the Palmar hydroelectric plant in the Departments of Rio Negro, Soriano, Flores, and Du- razno was completed by J. E. Baeza and Antonio Ted- dei with the assistance of students and professors of the Grupo de Arqueologia del Liceo de Young, and in conjunction with R. Bernal and R. Boretto (Museo de Fray Bentos), and Dr. Austral and Lic. A Diaz (Fa- cultad de Humanidades y Ciencias). Three assemblages have been identified. The first (1.20 m to the surface) is composed of stemmed and stemmed-shouldered points, scrapers, grinders, flakes, and cores that cor- respond to ones found by Teddei on the Rio Negro Medeio. The second component (40 cm to the surface) contains two ceramic types. One type is smooth with coarse temper, and the other is decorated with fine temper. Decoration includes corrugation and zoned red and/or black interiors. The third component occurs in the upper levels of sites with colonial and historic re- mains (glass, china, iron). Also as a result of the collaboration of the Grupo de Arqueologia del Liceo de Young, the Museo de Fray Bentos and CEA work was carried out in the area of Nuevo Berlin. At the site of Yeguada, a 14C date of 255 ? 60 B.P. (SI 6498) was obtained in association with "Drag and Jab" pottery, chert flakes, and bivalve Diplodon sp. Ronald L. Weber ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA This is the seventeenth time that I have sat myself down to write Current Research. I thank Liz King for offering me the job and Jack Roberts for encouraging me to take it. Seventeen years has got to be a record, for durability or sheer persistence, among assistant ed- itors of these pages. Although the labor has not always been fun, it has always been worthwhile-when I began in 1970 I knew far fewer of you and much less of your research. Apologizing to a young colleague the other day, for the repetitive and unoriginal nature of the task, it occurred to me that, regardless, the toil has been rewarding and creative: I have been creative in elic- iting, deciphering, condensing, clarifying, and, I am afraid, sometimes reinterpreting your contributions. For the last, I beg your forgiveness. I am happy that only once have I been threatened directly by your lawyers. Be that as it may, I leave Andean South America in the very gentle and capable hands of Richard Burger. I wish him at least as much enjoyment and profit from these pages as I have had-and I hope that you will be punctilious in sending your contributions to him, by May 15, at the Department of Anthropology, Yale Uni- versity, in New Haven. The above-mentioned changes pale in comparison to the new regulations on archaeological work in Peru, promulgated by a Supreme Resolution of the govern- ment (559-85) on September 11, 1985. These will be administered by a I iational Commission on Archae- ology, through the National Institute of Culture, and will once again require foreigners to submit their pro- posals directly through their embassies and receive a Supreme Resolution, or executive order, authorizing each project. Projects will be authorized for only one year, although renewals are possible. Graduate seniors and specialists in other disciplines, rather than working independently, must be incorporated within existing projects and work under the direct supervision of an archaeologist enrolled on the National Register. If you intend to conduct surveys or excavations in Peru, or have graduate students who would like to work there, you should initiate a petition for inclusion on the Reg- ister. One may petition to work on only one site at a time, and the petition must specify, among the more usual requirements, that stabilization efforts proceed simultaneously with the excavation, the proportion of your funds destined for publications, the facility to be used for storage and registration of the finds, and the methods to be used for stabilization, restoration, and protection after the excavations. At designated major sites, 50 percent of the archaeological budget must go for delimiting, conserving, and protecting the sites and the artifacts recovered. The archaeologist must budget for mapping the site at a scale of at least 1:50,000 and the sectors affected at 1:10,000 or better. It goes with- out saying that copies of the field notes, catalogs, pho- tographs, drawings, maps, and profiles should be de- posited at the Documentation Center for Archaeological Patrimony. These are good requirements, although it remains to be seen whether they will be effectively and equitably applied. Especially laudable features include the explicit extension of the regulations to private, as well as public lands, and the provision for the estab- lishment of Archaeological Reserve Zones, to be saved for the future development of new techniques of in- vestigation. It is no wonder that the pace of archaeological field- work has slackened somewhat, especially at major sites. But, overall, this will probably prove to have been beneficial, especially as Peru's problems are com- pounded by economic and social difficulties that, in themselves, have made the mounting of major projects very difficult. Already it is clear that impediments to new fieldwork, whatever their source, have the salutary effect of promoting new work with old collections and data sets. This has been especially noticeable in the area of environmental and natural sciences. While some palynologists, particularly, need totally new samples 180 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH collected under ideal circumstances, other scientists have made good progress with incompletely studied specimens from former excavations. Studies by Deb- orah Pearsall (University of Missouri), who is exam- ining the last of the plant remains from Guitarrero Cave, among her many other tasks, are often cited in this regard. Similarly, Harold B. and Judith C. Rollins (Univer- sity of Pittsburgh), with Daniel H. Sandweiss (Cornell University), can make good use of your boxes full of shells from stratified sites anywhere along the Andean coast. Since 1984 they have studied the impact of El Nifio conditions on incremental shell growth in this zone, in present and past time. Analysis of valves from mollusks that survived the 1982-1983 event demon- strate a recognizable break in growth (analogous to Harris lines in human skeletons) caused by unfavorable changes in the mollusks' environment. Oxygen isotope analysis confirms the changes in water temperature. Rollins and his colleagues hope to identify prehistoric El Ninio events by finding the distinctive growth break on shells from your archaeological sites along the An- dean coastline. On the cultural side as well, scholars continue to intensify their studies of neglected collections from for- mer stages of archaeological and antiquarian efforts. Good examples would be Patricia Knobloch's (Insti- tute of Andean Studies) photography and analysis of 400 pots and textiles housed at the Volkerkunde Mu- seum in Berlin, and the catalog of the Ernst Frank collection of Peruvian antiquities, under preparation by Monica Barnes and Elayne Zorn at Cornell Uni- versity. Field archaeology, in the British sense of ex- amination of surficial remains, also has been given a boost in recent years by architectural analyses and in- terpretations by William Conklin (American Museum of Natural History) at Huaca Los Reyes, Carlos Wil- liams (Lima) at a number of sites, and others. Andean archaeologists seem to have had more time to attend conferences as well. Much exchange of in- formation supplements the social interaction at the annual meeting of the Institute of Andean Studies (Berkeley), Midwest Conference on Andean and Am- azonian Archaeology and Ethnohistory (Columbia, Missouri, in 1986), and Northeast Conference on An- dean Archaeology and Ethnohistory (Albany in 1985, Ithaca in 1986). The Northeast Conference has spawned a journal, Andean Past, which is published at Cornell and edited by Dan Sandweiss. Elegant publications nearly always result from the Dumbarton Oaks round table conference, which was dedicated to the contro- versial topic of Wari political organization in 1985. The gathering brought together researchers from Bo- livia, Canada, England, Peru, and the United States. The 45th International Congress of Americanists met in Bogota, the 10th National Congress on Chilean Ar- chaeology in Arica, and the 6th Congress on Andean Man and Culture in Lima. On a less grandiose, but perhaps more informative scale, a number of archae- ologists met in August in Ilo, Peru, to discuss the prob- lematic western valleys of the South Central Andean Area, where recently there has been much productive fieldwork. In happier days Edward P. Lanning would have attended all of these meetings with relish. Un- fortunately, we mourned his death in June of 1985, after an end that was truly tragic, but also character- istically Andean in its final pirotecnico. ECUADOR. Gregory Knapp (University of Tex- as, Austin), with Jose Echeverria (Otavalo Institute of Anthropology), spent the summer of 1985 mapping traditional irrigation systems in the northern highlands of Ecuador. Many of the irrigation canals still in use are associated with Late Period settlement mounds (to- las) and ceramics, including canals above Pimampiro, Atuntaqui, Caranqui, and in the Chota Valley. Patricia Mothes (also from Austin) conducted an associated study of the modern functioning of a prehistoric canal still in use. Results suggest that irrigation was wide- spread in pre-Inca times, and that irrigation helps ex- plain patterns of political geography of late pre-Inca chiefdoms. Research by Ann Mester (University of Illinois) con- cerns long-distance, maritime trading practices of the Integration Period Manteiio of coastal Ecuador, who supplied the Incas with mullu. In her excavations at the Los Frailes mound complex of Manabi, she iden- tified a mother-of-pearl shell workshop, dating to be- tween A.D. 900 and 1100, or the earliest part of the Libertad (Mantefio del Sur) ceramic sequence of Alli- son Paulsen. Judging from diving weights found at the site, the artisans themselves dove for the shell, which was made into rectangular beads destined for the sump- tuary trade. Mester proposes that the beads were sewn onto cloth to make the shirts of mother-of-pearl men- tioned by Pachacuti Yamqui in Huayna Capac's mar- riage ceremony. These would also resemble somewhat the Chimu shirts of gold beads. Mester's research, sup- ported by Fulbright-Hays and the Banco Central, shows that a range of marine shells was important in the Andean system of long-distance trade, and it is wel- come evidence of a primary manufacturing center that supplied the League of Merchants with goods to trade. Peter Stahl (University of London Institute of Ar- chaeology) has traveled from laboratory to laboratory, identifying archaeological faunas from several recent excavation programs in western Ecuador. His expand- ed and relatively comprehensive catalog of Formative (Valdivia 1 and 2, Chorrera) remains from Loma Alta indicates exploitation of numerous zones, with partic- ular emphasis on humid, forested environs. The small sample from Late Valdivia and Jama-Coaque (Re- gional Developmental Period) contexts at San Isidro exhibits the same pattern. Stahl has identified domes- ticated guinea pig in Early Guangala and Late Prehis- toric Manteiio levels, where muskoy duck is also found. Rare camelid remains are now documented from In- tegration Period (Milagro-Quevedo) contexts at Penion del Rio. There and at Real Alto, faunal remains from the floors may reveal the taphonomic agents (such as dogs, trampling, and sweeping) that were important in prehistoric times. At the University of Massachusetts (Amherst), Pa- tricia J. Netherly reports that field research and analysis of data, obtained by survey in the Arenillas Valley, continue with support from the Anthropological Mu- seum of the Banco Central. A new investigation of water management strategies and settlement patterns in 181</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the Lower Arenillas Valley, where large core villages from as early as the Machalilla Period have been found, was begun with Alfred H. Siemens. NORTHERN PERU. With funding by Earth- watch, and a focus on the role of early forest cultures in changing subsistence strategies, Tom D. Dillehay (University of Kentucky), and Patricia Netherly (Uni- versity of Massachusetts, Amherst) completed their third season of investigation into the social and eco- nomic strategies of resources use, across ecological and cultural boundaries, in the Middle Zafia Valley and Nanchoc Quebrada. The Cementerio de Nanchoc is interpreted as a multi-component, non-residential pre- ceramic site, characterized by a pair of low, three-tiered earth and stone mounds and an associated, specialized work area. From the absence of domestic refuse, the type of artifact content and context, and the presence of platform-mound architecture, Netherly and Dille- hay hypothesize that the Cementerio site was a public place where specialized economic activities took place. Radiocarbon dates begin at 6900 B.P. A survey of lateral quebradas in the Nanchoc sector of the valley located a complex of 47 preceramic res- idential sites, and limited testing of these sites yielded domestic debris, including unifacial tools and grinding slabs and stones. Dates on charcoal from buried hearths are 7950 ? 180 B.P. (Beta 12385) and 7920 ? 120 B.P. (Beta 12384). Although there are gaps in the data and chronological ordering, Dillehay and Netherly suggest a rather complex, homogeneous, and widespread pre- ceramic tradition beginning in this forested zone about 8,000 years ago. At the Batan Grande National Monument (Lam- bayeque), Izumi Shimada of Harvard University be- gan a multi-year effort to define the chronology and function of the Sican Precinct, a T-shaped area with some dozen monumental adobe constructions believed to have been the capitol of the Middle Sican polity. Extensive survey, cleaning of looters' pits, further test excavations (one penetrating to Early Horizon ce- ramics and firepit) and excavation of selected wall cor- ners and abutments were supported by the National Geographic Society. Although today the Sican Precinct appears vacant and largely destroyed by decades of looting, Izumi proposes that the areas around the rel- atively well-preserved pyramids contained structures for the administration of copper production, interre- gional trade, and closely supervised manufacture and storage of valued status goods. In addition, the Precinct is seen as a funerary and religious pilgrimage center. Izumi visualizes a sort of "Vatican" model of reli- gious polity-one that promoted its ideology through pilgrimage and a rigid art style and iconography, while wielding considerable economic and political power as a prestigious patron of crafts and supplier of luxury goods. Structural-functional analysis of the Sican Pre- cinct tests his view of the ceremonial center as a site with a limited range of functions and only a small resident population. Details on this and the following project are contained in Willay 20/21, available from the Shimadas at the Peabody Museum of Harvard. In 1985, the Japanese Scientific Expedition to Nu- clear America, under the direction of Kazuo Terada (University of Tokyo), carried out a general survey of a wide area spanning the Departments of La Libertad, Lambayeque, and Cajamarca, as well as excavating at the sites of Huacaloma and Cerro Blanco. At Huaca- loma the team sought to clarify the enigmatic Early Layzon phase, transitional from Late Huacaloma, as well as the nature of the architectural complex of the Late Period. The Late Huacaloma complex is truly monumental, consisting of four platforms with retain- ing walls and stairways. They also found hints of one or more colonnaded buildings with finely painted mu- rals. Yoshio Onuki and Yasutake Kato worked at Cerro Blanco, an artificial mound built upon a natural hill, just 1.5 km northeast of Kuntur Wasi in the Depart- ment of Cajamarca. Walls of large stones cover about 1 ha and seem to be the remains of at least three low rectangular platforms connected by stairways. These date to a final period (Sotera) contemporary with Lay- zon, while earlier, thoroughly destroyed phases (La Conga and Cerro Blanco) correlate with Early and Late Huacaloma. CENTRAL PERU. At the Quaternary Institute of the University of Bordeaux, Santiago Uceda Castillo has analyzed the results of his excavations and surveys in the Casma Valley and neighboring desert. He iden- tified some 40 quarries, workshops, and camps-some with appreciable midden-assigned to three prece- ramic complexes: a) Paijan, characterized by the typ- ical long-stemmed projectile points, varied sidescrap- ers, retouched flakes, and notched and denticulate tools; b) Mongoncillo, marked by bipolar flake removal and a basically unifacial industry dominated by per- forators, less varied sidescrapers, and rare notched and denticulate tools; and c) Late Preceramic, where picks and beaked tools, simple sidescrapers, and diverse notched and denticulate tools were produced-partly by alternating retouch-on chunks and slabs as often as on flakes. From his test pits, Uceda obtained char- coal dated at 6070 ? 70 B.P. and 6050 ? 70 B.P. (Gif 6772 and 6773) in apparent association with marine mollusks, fish bones, algarrobo seeds, squash, cotton, and maize. A cob of maize was examined by Alex Grobman and is said to be intermediate between Con- fite chavinense and Confite morocho, but closer to the latter. In 1986, Steve Oberon (Atlantic Testing Laborato- ries) will proceed with the second phase of his study of the documented Inka state shrine called Wanakaure, in the Huallaga region of the Department of Huanuco. Having located what appear to be the ruins of this holy place during his last field season, he will try to deter- mine the extent of Wanakaure, survey and map the architectural remains, and carry out surface collection and limited excavation. Two other, possibly related Inka sites are tentatively identified as a storehouse complex and mitmaq settlement near the Wanakaure shrine. Craig Morris (American Museum of Natural His- tory) reports numerous activities during the 1985 sea- son of the Chincha-Pisco project. Luis Lumbreras (University of San Marcos) continued his survey of the lower and middle Chincha Valley, identifying several 182 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH major sites for all periods from the Early Horizon through the Colonial Period. Ancient fields and sites in the southern perimeter of the valley, not formerly explored by Dwight Wallace, are especially notable. Lumbreras and his colleagues also excavated at the Early Horizon site of El Mono, while Morris and Idilio Santillana (INDEA) continued to work in La Centinela, especially in the Inka sector, where weaving imple- ments and the raw materials of textile manufacture were discovered in 1984. In the National Archive in Lima and several local sources, Ana Maria Soldi con- tinued to labor on early historical material for both valleys. John Murra (Cornell University) searched for new documents in the Archive of the Indies in Sevelle, as well as other Spanish sources. Work in the Chincha field laboratory was continued by Deborah Pearsall (University of Missouri) and Luis Lumbreras, Jr. (San Marcos), who developed new procedures for the iden- tification and study of plant remains. Morris and Ma- ruja Dianderas (San Marcos) installed a computerized data base management program to facilitate cataloging and analysis. Ann Peters (Cornell University) finished the first stage of a study of the economy of the society that produced Topara ceramics in the lower Pisco Valley during the transition between the Formative and Early Interme- diate periods. The influence of the Topara ceramic tradition on early Nazca ceramics, and its association with the burials of Paracas Necropolis, indicate the dynamism and regional importance of the society char- acterized by Topara ceramics. A survey of the lower Pisco Valley and excavations at Pachinga, carried out by Peters in 1985, represent the first study of the habitation sites and economic activities of that society. Her work also illuminates the relationship of Topara to the previous Paracas tradi- tion and subsequent local Nazca-related tradition, and the relationships among the sites of Pisco and the Ne- cropolis burials. Mapping, surface collection, and an excavation in a second Topara site, combined with the analysis of various organic remains, are scheduled for late in 1986. Helaine Silverman (University of Illinois, Urbana) completed a test of the hypothesis that Cahuachi, long thought to be the principal site of the Nazca culture, was an urban center. She determined that Duncan Strong's so-called "habitation mounds" or tells were, in fact, non-domestic artificial mounds built up of a variety of construction fills. Excavations conducted across the site in the open areas, thought to be zones of domestic habitation, show that they served as plazas where devotees of the Nazca religious cult came to celebrate sacred rituals and rites of social group cohe- sion. Cahuachi functioned as a basically empty cere- monial center and pilgrimage shrine. The many mounds are considered to represent a kind of"provincial tem- ple" situation, somewhat as at Pachacamac, with each social group having its own temple at the major reli- gious center. Intensive survey of Cahuachi reveals the site to be nearly three times larger, east to west, than shown on Strong's often copied map. There are many artificial mounds, often based on modified natural hills, spread over an area more than 3 km long by 1 km wide, interspersed by plazas. The mounds themselves should not be considered to be monumental constructions, because much of the mass is natural rather than cul- tural. Despite a history of looting, intact early Nazca tombs were also discovered. The material from the tombs is under study by Miguel Pazos (National In- stitute of Culture), while elaborate three-dimensional textile embroideries are being analyzed by Graciela Fattorini de Paredes of the same institution. SOUTHERN PERU. Since 1982, Ian Farrington (Australian National University) has recorded and mapped agricultural terraces, canals, river channeliza- tion schemes, and associated Inka sites in the Uru- bamba Valley between Caicai and Chilca, on the Pam- pa de Anta, and in the Cuzco Valley. Excavations to examine terrace construction and water supply were conducted at Pisunaymiyoc, Ollantaytambo. Using documentary sources, it is possible to isolate criteria that enable field identification of private lands, state or sun lands, and lands that belonged to local com- munities during the Inka period. Principles of canal construction, water use, and drainage of bottomland have been identified. Statistical analysis of linear mea- surements has now determined the basic unit to have been 1.615 ? .001 meters. Work has now begun on the Inka unit of areal measurement, the topo. With John Earls (University of the Pacific, Lima) and Ken Heffernan (ANU) Farrington has begun a metrological, geometric, constructional, and microclimatological analysis of the unusual circular terraces at Moray. Heffernan has also conducted a survey of prehistoric sites in the Limatambo Basin and adjacent valleys north of the Apurimac, such as Chinchaypuquio, identifying the Pre-Inkaic settlement and agricultural patterns. Hef- fernan has located the quarry for the fine cut stones of the Tarawas site, as well as designating Limatambo, with its numerous terraced royal lands, as a miniature sacred valley. Finally, in 1985, with Elias Mujica of the Municipality of Lima, Farrington began a survey of villages and agricultural lands in the lomas of Pachacamac, south of Lima. Eight villages comprising many agglutinated stone structures were located and mapped. Fields irrigated by short canals from wells and springs were recorded, but the most remarkable schemes occur on the lomas hillsides where short cross- slope embankments brought limited runoff to regularly shaped fields lower down. In the Province of Sandia (Puno), Bruce Winter- halder (University of North Carolina) is coordinating ecological research on population, subsistence prac- tices, and interaction of two communities with access to different ecological zones in the District of Cuyocuyo on the eastern escarpment. At Punayllo, production focuses on camelid grazing and tuber farming, while Ura ayylo, slightly lower, specializes on maize agri- culture combined with tubers, especially oca. In con- junction with Winterhalder's project, there has been an archaeological survey of the Cuyocuyo region, con- ducted by Joan Nelson (Beloit College), Carol Goland, and Marc Bermann (University of Michigan). Ap- proximately 40 km2 were covered, spanning lands on the narrow valley bottom at 3,000 m up to 4,500 m. The intensive agricultural terracing of the valley 183</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY prompted the expectation that prehispanic site density would be high, but few sites were found. The largest are situated on high, inaccessible ridges, such as Cho- quechambi, which covers about 10 ha and contains roughly 150 structures. The architecture of the circular structures is quite homogeneous, here and at other sites, with masonry consisting of stacked rectangular slabs of the local slate. Thirty-five isolated structures at the western end of Choquechambi, with rock floors and possible vents, may have been used for storage. Llactapata, on the south side of the river, is also perched on a high inaccessible ridge. Although it covers only one-fifth the area, there are as many as 300 struc- tures, mostly circular but some rectangular. Here too, the ceramics suggest a Late Intermediate Period date, with decorated Collao wares pointing to ties with the Titicaca Basin. The sole moderate-sized site on the lower slopes is Pucarabamba (3,400 m) on a spur with a commanding view of the valley and river 100 m below. With an area of only half a hectare, Pucara- bamba contains perhaps 75 structures. Although var- ious fields and terraces of the Cuyocuyo region were surveyed as well, Goland and her collaborators iden- tified no pottery known to predate the Late Interme- diate Period. Work on the ceramics recovered by the Colca River Abandoned Terrace Project (Arequipa) began in 1985, supported by the National Geographic Society. Mi- chael Malpass (St. Lawrence University) and Pablo de la Vera Cruz (Instituto de Estudios del Sur) have de- fined 32 tentative types, based on attributes of form, surface finish, and surface treatment. The great ma- jority of sherds can be grouped into two major series. The first is characterized by black on red designs and includes members of both the Chuquibamba and local Inka series defined by earlier researchers. The second includes ceramics that are very well made and typically have a zone of red slip on the interior and exterior of the rim, although the slipping often extends over the entire outside of the pot. The latter series appears to be related to Wari ceramics from the Ayacucho area. Work planned for 1986 involves tracing the develop- ment of Chuquibamba pottery out of the earlier rim- slipped wares and refining the Chuquibamba to Inka transition. John Treacy, a geographer working under project director William Denevan (University of Wisconsin, Madison), is in the Colca Valley on a Fulbright fellow- ship, studying present-day agriculture and, specifically, the modern pattern of terrace use. Pablo de la Vera Cruz is also conducting further survey and excavations in the vicinity of Cabana Conde to identify the cultural chronology of that area and to relate it to the sequence from the Coporaque region. In 1985, the Northwestern University Archaic Proj- ect focused on the sierra environmental zone (2,500 to 4,000 m elevation) of the Coscori, Asana, and Cha- raque rivers in the Department of Moquegua. This long-term project was designed to study the use of and adaptation to the Osmore drainage during the Archaic period (10,000 to 4000 B.C.). In their "siteless survey" of 4.6 km2, the bottoms, terraces, and lower slopes of the stream courses were divided into blocks, and each block was walked in parallel transects spaced 5 m apart. Along about 18 linear km of these streams, the North- western team flagged and located all artifacts by com- pass bearings. Over 50 Archaic components were dis- covered, ranging from single artifacts to sites covering 2,000 m2. Asana 2, found in a cut bank at the elevation of about 3,500 m, consists of at least five thick, organ- ically stained lenses, separated by sterile lenses of al- luvial soils. The deepest of the lenses is about 4 m below modern ground surface. The longest runs over 30 m across the exposed profile. They observed hearths, pits, and other features, together with well-preserved bones, chert, and obsidian artifacts. Six major rockshelters, and at least ten smaller ones, were located. Four tested shelters contained substantial aceramic occupations, and carbon samples are being dated from each, as well as from Asana 2. Organic preservation is excellent and Archaic projectile point types occur in the basal levels of most of the shelters. The team also located stone quarry sites. These will be critical to understanding patterns of consumption and distribution oflithic artifacts, and, in many cases, they can give insight on exchange or mobility between ad- jacent ecological zones. Although the Northwestern studies are still in progress, there is a definite asym- metry of the distribution of lithic materials. Raw ma- terials that outcrop only on the altiplano are found rarely in the sierra, while, conversely, sierra materials are encountered commonly on the altiplano. This pat- tern could be explained either by an asymmetric ex- change relationship or by differential use of the zones. More work on the archaeological correlates of these processes will be required to distinguish between them. In 1986, Mark Aldenderfer and his crew plan to work either in the altiplano, around the Chila-Osmore drain- age divide, or at shelters and open sites in the sierra zone, just below the altiplano. At the lower end of the Osmore drainage, working under the auspices of the Contisuyu Program, Elias Mujica, Jorge Tapia (University of San Marcos), Garth Bawden, Kelli Carmean, Mary Houghteling (Univer- sity of New Mexico), Christopher Clement, Greg Smith, and Michael Moseley (University of Florida) are in- vestigating sites, settlement patterns, agricultural sys- tems, and hydrological dynamics associated with the long-term loss of farmland at multiple, small spring- fed canal networks on the desert coast near Ilo. Moseley reports that these springs once supported 10 to 100 percent more cultivated terrain than now. Abandoned lands occur at the distal ends of canal systems in use and also above operating systems, where they were watered by canals that are no longer functional. Similar abandonment configurations are identified by Charles Stanish (University of Chicago) in river- irrigated terraces at the headwaters of the Moquegua River, and, through earlier research, have been noted in floodplain irrigation at the mouth of the Moche River. Such recurrent configurations in widely spaced locales raise the possibility that long-term and con- tinuing abandonment of irrigated lands of the Pacific watershed can be modeled by relatively few and simple patterns of canal contraction and replacement. One goal of the Ilo research is to develop methods for economically mapping abandoned land from stereo compilation of early aerial photographs. Using photos 184 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH taken in 1951, Clement showed the feasibility of quan- tifying recent agrarian contraction, which might then be compared to earlier patterns established by archae- ological survey. Two land loss processes are seen. In the first, abandonment begins with fields at the ends of canals, advances up the channels, and eventually envelops the intakes. This is a pattern of horizontal contraction back to the water source. In the second pattern, replacement canals are built downstream, with their intakes positioned below older, higher, aban- doned canals. This is a process of vertical abandon- ment, with agriculture at higher elevations being re- placed by farming at lower altitudes. The Ilo data indicate that these are sequential, recurrent patterns that may narrow the search for causes of abandonment. On river-fed irrigation systems, abandoned canal in- takes and original stream channels generally are not preserved. Without physical connection of irrigation to original water sources, the influence of hydrological versus cultural dynamics in land loss has remained moot. However, as both abandoned canal intakes and abandoned springs often are preserved in the Ilo study area, it is possible there to investigate and correlate canal use and unstable water-source dynamics on a millenary scale. Some formerly productive springs are completely dry. The inability of a canal mouth to take in sufficient water from a decreasing source results in horizontal contraction. Other springs have moved downstream through as much as 25 m of elevation. As the water source lost elevation, canal intakes were grad- ually stranded and horizontal contraction resulted. With continued loss of elevation and eventual spring aban- donment, the final result was a vertical contraction and downward shift in farming to younger replacement ca- nals. The factors causing change in spring flow and position remain to be identified. However, the Ilo data suggest to geologist Tapia that long-term loss of irri- gated terrain, over vast areas of the arid Pacific wa- tershed, might have more to do with hydrological and physical variables than with technological and cultural ones. Site survey undertaken by Bawden, Carmean, and Houghteling was designed to explore correlations be- tween changing hydrological patterns and changing set- tlement patterns. The study area contains farming communities, maritime communities, and corrals and sites associated with pastoral and hunting activities in the lomas zone. Mujica is developing the seriation and chronology of the later Prehispanic occupation through excavations and tests at sites related to Chiribaya and Tiwanaku, while Smith is developing the archaeolog- ical chronology of the historic period. Major concerns are the demographic and economic changes associated with the introduction, in 1541, of olive cultivation from Spain, including the replacement of subsistence farming by farming for export. Thomas F. Lynch SOUTHERN CONE ARGENTINA. Northwest Puna. Lidia Clara Garcia (Instituto de Ciencias Antropol6gicas, Facultad de Filosofia y Letras, Universidad de Buenos Aires- ICA, FFL, UBA) has begun the analysis of surface and test-cut samples from caves and rockshelters of four sites in the Inca Cueva Creek, Jujuy Province, in order to compare aceramic settlements of the area with others of the Puna. Alicia A. Fernmndez Distel (Centro Argentino de Et- nologia Americana-CAEA-and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas Tecnicas-CONICET) has developed archaeological research in the High Puna of Jujuy, beginning with the drawing of an archaeo- logical map of the Dept. of Susques. This project is faced as salvage archaeology: a road joining the Ar- gentine North with San Pedro de Atacama (Antofa- gasta, Chile) goes nearby the Huachichocana caves. The Le6n Huasi I unit has yielded maize cobs that are expected to be of high antiquity because they were found in aceramic levels. The excavation of small walled caves is to begin soon. It is expected that paleobotanic analysis will shed light on the origin of maize. In ad- dition, for the only occupation level at the foot of a large mural with human-face pictographs in Volcan de Yacoraite, Tilcara, a date of 760 + 65 B.P. (Hv 12541) was obtained. The association is with pottery typical of the Humahuaca culture. Hugo D. Yacobaccio (ICA, UBA, CONICET) has continued work at the Alero de las Circunferencias, in Azul Pampa, Jujuy, at 3,600 m above the sea level. This research is a part of the Project "Settlements Sys- tems of the Hunter Gatherers of the Puna." Yacobaccio detected the following components: (a) Spanish-Indi- an: an occupation layer covered with slabs and hearths, fragmented bones, and pottery sherds. Lithic speci- mens consist of projectile points of three types: stem- less triangular, large lanceolate, and small triangular and stemmed. Exotic elements include glass fragments, glass beads, probable Ovis sp. bones, and peach stones. An estimated age between the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries is offered. (b) Late occupation: upper level 5 with hearths and Red-on-Black pottery. There are abundant cameloid bones and projectile points of the above described types. (c) Early Pottery occupation: base of level 5. A tomb was found, 50 cm in diameter and 15 cm deep containing the lower limb of an infant and loose teeth, all above a layer of grasses. A black polished bowl, displaying inner decoration of mice in- lay, was found as a possible cache on the edge of the tomb. Radiocarbon analyses are under way, but an estimate of 3000-2500 B.P. is suggested. Neighboring levels related to the tomb yielded stemless triangular points similar to other sites such Inca Cueva 4, plus cameloid bones. (d) Preceramic occupation: at level 6, from 1.95 m deep. Abundant instruments made of local quartzite are found together with the remains of 14 cameloids and many bones of Chinchillidae. Ap- parently prey has been butchered in the site, and only the least yielding parts have been left. Yacobaccio pos- tulates a chronology between 5000 and 7500 B.P. based on the characteristics of preceramic occupation in the area. Further research carried out at the Inca Cueva 4, mainly on faunal remains and animal fibers by Ya- cobaccio and Cecilia Perez de Micou, suggests strong emphasis on chinchilla more than on cameloids, co- inciding with other South-Central Andes sites (Hua- 185</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY chichocana, Tuina, and San Lorenzo) for this date (11,000 to 8000 B.P.). This contrasts with the high sites of the Central Andes, where emphasis was placed on cameloid and deer. At Inca Cueva 4, 80% of the near 5,000 bones are Lagidium sp. or Chinchilla sp. Anal- ysis of cameloid fiber found at Inca Cueva was under- taken. As compared to a progressive series of samples organized by thickness and medular index, the Inca Cueva 4 samples approach llama values (ca. 40 mu thick and 50% medular index), suggesting some hy- potheses on the early handling of cameloid herds. Valliserrana Region. Alicia A. Fernmndez Distel continues the analysis ofprehispanic patrimony in Sal- ta Province, under sponsorship of the Academia Na- cional de Bellas Artes de Argentina. Her task also in- cludes sites with rock art. Publication is scheduled for 1986. Ver6nica Williams (ICA, UBA, CONICET), under the direction of Ana Maria Lorandi (ICA, UBA, CONICET), has undertaken a functional study of the Inca site Potrero Chaquiago in the area of Andalgala, Catamarca Province, to detect the origin of the non- Inca residents. The site will also be compared to the town of Famabalasto, south of the El Caj6n Valley and to Ingenio El Arenal Medanos, south of the Santa Ma- ria Valley. The sites are in the same area and an intimate relationship is suggested for the mitimas in the three instances, given inferred kinship and/or political re- lationships between Late Period groups of the Central area of Catamarca Province. The Inca in the Northwest. Rodolfo A. Raffino (UBA, Universidad Nacional de La Plata-UNLP, CONICET), with collaboration by Ricardo Alvis, Ana- hi Icona, Gabriela Ravifia, Lidia Baldini (all UNLP, CONICET), A. Callegari (INA), and J. Palma (UBA), and sponsorship from the Museo de La Plata, the UBA, and the National Geographic Society (Grant 2834), has undertaken three archaeological missions under his "Proyecto Inca en los Andes Meridionales." In an area included between 65? and 66?W, and 20030' and 24?S, from 2,500 to 4,100 m above sea level, Raffino iden- tified (by means of surface reconnaissance and remote sensors) a total of 31 Inca sites, 23 of which are in the border area between Argentina and Bolivia, and the remaining eight are in the Dept. of Potosi. Most of them are tampus by the Inca Road, of which some 10 segments could be detected. A few sites are large set- tlements, and seem to have been the center of more complex activities. Among the latter are Chuquiago and Chagua in Potosi, and Titiconte and La Huerta in Argentina. Subandean Region. Alicia Fernmndez Distel, com- missioned by the Museo Hist6rico y Arqueologico de San Pedro de Jujuy, of which she is currently director, is carrying out two excavations in the vicinity of San Francisco River, in the Dept. of San Pedro. In both cases it seems there are villages with middens, and one site (Los Homos) has stone habitation structures. A radiocarbon date from the deepest level of one room (Los Homos la, level 5) goes back to 2365 ? 90 B.P. (SI 9772). An older cut excavated by Fernandez Distel in Abra de Los Morteros nearby the Sierra Santa Bar- bara (GAK 9772 ) resulted in a date of 3460 + 110 B.P. and allegedly is associated with a larger proportion of corrugated pottery than that observed in the more classic San Francisco Complex sites. A point Distel takes into consideration is the typology of the crude stone artifacts associated with the ceramic complex of San Francisco. Beatriz Ventura (Programa de Estudios Prehist6ri- cos-PREP, UBA, CONICET) keeps working in one of the least known areas of the Argentine Northwest. She has surveyed the second known site with rock art by the shore of the Rio Grande de Tarija. The engrav- ings are generally of an abstract nature but human feet also appear. She has also studied archaeological col- lections in museums of the neighboring Bolivian Dept. of Tarija, and has been visiting archaeological sites to prove or disprove possible vinculations in the area. The most valuable comparative material, in Ventura's opinion, is a peculiarly decorated pottery type found at sites in the forest of Oran Dept., Salta Province. These sites include Arrasayal, Penia Colorado, Abra Grande, and Aguas Blancas. Northern Pampas. Maria Isabel Gonzalez de Bonaveri (INA, FFL, UBA) is carrying out research in the central lagoons of Buenos Aires Province, north of the Rio Salado. The region includes lakes such as Chas- com6s and others nearby, and the area is thought to have been favorable for the settlements of the "Que- randi" Indians. Gonzalez de Bonaveri is examining and comparing archaeological and historical sources in order to clarify the meaning and extent of what is pres- ently known as "Querandi." Gustavo Politis (UNLP, CONICET) is investigating the archaeology of Pampean Region hunting-gathering groups, with a special emphasis on the period desig- nated as "Early man." He is probing and excavating several sites. Arroyo Seco 2 is a multicomponent site with a Paleoindian base-camp in the lowest levels, where clear evidence has been found of an association be- tween unifacial quartzite instruments and Pleistocene mammals (Megatherium, American horse, etc.). Under the "Early man" component, 16 articulated human skeletons have been found; these skeletons probably belong to this occupation. La Modera is a site where Doedicurus sp. (Glyptodon) was hunted by the shore of an ancient bog. The cultural remains consist of hundreds of flakes of crystalline quartz (some with secondary retouch), as well as two flakes of quartzite and one of chert. Laguna Tres Reyes shows a possible association between fauna, a bifacial instrument and unifacial flakes of quartzite. Politis, together with a research team in- cluding M6nica Saleme (Comisi6n de Investigaciones Cientificas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires-CIC, UNLP), Patricia Madrid (UNLP, CONICET), and stu- dents Fernando Oliva and Dario Olmo (both UNLP), are also studying more recent sites in the Sierra de la Ventana area. The La Toma site shows, at its upper levels and ca. 1000 B.P., an adaptation to the hunting of the guanaco and deer when the climate was changing to present conditions. The same group is surveying rock paintings of the Ventania System, and surveying other areas in the counties of Tornquist, Coronel Prin- gles, Tres Arroyos, and Coronel Suarez. Mario Silveira, Eduardo Crivelli Montero, and Emi- lio Eugenio, under the direction of Alicia Fernmndez Distel and Mario Silveira (all Paleontological Section, 186 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH CAEA, CONICET), are studying, among other aspects, settlement and subsistence patterns among the aborig- ines of Buenos Aires Province, including changes brought about by the introduction of horse and arau- canization. Two sites are being stratigraphically ex- cavated: Laguna de Sotelo, near Mar Chiquita, is uni- component and features pottery either plain or with incised decoration, and small, stemless projectile points. Faunal remains are scarce and include guanaco, deer, a cetacean, fiandu (Rhea) eggshells, edentata, rodentia, and a marsupial, plus a shell pendant. Human remains are dispersed into a restricted area. This site imme- diately precedes the settlement of colonists of the area. Fortin Necochea, the second site being studied, is in the County of General Lamadrid. First occupations are prior to 6010 ? 400 B.P. (LP-88)-(C SIC 593), coin- ciding with stratigraphic evidence from other sites in the area. Fortin Necochea's most recent remains belong to the horse complex. Beginning with a mainly guanaco subsistence supplemented by deer and small fauna, iiandu eggs were collected. Milling stones are abundant. Final occupations include horse, sheep, and cow herd- ing. Lithic tools are similar throughout the sequence. Central-West (Cuyana) Region. J. Roberto Bar- cena (CONICET, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo- UNCuyo) has reassumed fieldwork after two years in Europe. From October 1985 through March 1986, he and a team completed excavations at Jagiiel III (2,500 m above sea level in the arid NE of the Uspallate Valley) and Alero 1 of Arroyo Tambillos (3,000 m above sea level, Cordillera del Tigre). Both are sites of temporary occupation with levels dated at 2250 B.C., 1600 B.C., 410 B.C., and 1680 B.C. (Jagiiel III), and 180 B.C., 650 B.C., 840 B.C., and 880 B.C. (Alero 1). Occupations are related to hunting (cameloids) and gathering, especially cactus (Maihueniopsis glomera- ta). Alero 1 shows stronger emphasis in cameloid hunt- ing, but the bone represents only certain parts of the animals. Both sites, together with Agua de la Tinaja, at 2,000 m altitude in central Uspallate Valley, allow for peopling of the area related to different subsistence activities at diverse moments of the regional prehis- tory. Barcena has also continued research on the Inca Period with excavation of a section of the Tambo de Tambillos, located near the interprovincial road Us- pallata-Calingasta. In addition, Barcena conducted a survey in the sector toward the headwaters of the Ar- royo Tambillos, at 4,000 m above sea level. The survey data suggest the probability of Inca remains related to the Cerro Tambillos (5,600 m above sea level) and other neighboring cerros. Humberto A. Lagiglia (Director, Museo de Historia Natural de San Rafael, Mendoza Province) is carrying out research in the area of the Cerro Nevado and its environs, at ca. 3,810 m altitude, to the South of Men- doza Province. Numerous caves and shelters, as well as open-air sites, have been found and will be exca- vated during 1986. Surface collections and morpho- typological heterogeneity of lithic material points the area as a key to understanding cultural displacements between La Pampa Province, north of the Patagonia, and the southwest and northwest of Mendoza. The Museo Municipal is also releasing a series of publications on regional scientific achievements. The series is written for a popular audience, and is pub- lished under the name Sagema. The first 20 issues of Sagema deal with the prehistory of Mendoza. Patagonia. Under the direction of Amalia Sangui- netti de B6rmida, the "Programa de Estudios Prehis- t6ricos," PREP (CONICET, UBA) has been stimulat- ing archaeological research in Patagonia. Nine researchers are developing projects in different areas of this enormous territory. Sanguinetti de B6rmida, under an agreement between Hidronor S.A. and UBA, continues research and salvage archaeology in the area of construction of the Alicura and Piedra del Aguila dams, on the Limay River Basin (Neuqu6n and Rio Negro provinces). A research team also including Damiana Curzio, Eduardo Crivelli, Luis Borrero, Bea- triz Ventura, and Hugo Nami, has completed the gen- eral cultural development in the Alicura area. Begin- ning ca. 9000 B.P. at Cueva Traful I, there are dates of 4120 ? 80 B.P. (LATYR) for Cueva Traful III and 2880 ? 140 B.P. (INGEIS) for Malal Huaca, an open- air site with a ceramic component associated with the "foot point" style of rock gravures. After three field surveys at Piedra del Aguila, excavations were begun at stratified sites in April 1986. Sanguinetti de B6rmida is also developing a synthe- sis of the ancient peopling of Patagonia, with a start point based on unpublished information for Las Bui- treras and other sites of the Gallegos and the Chico rivers (Santa Cruz Province). Carlos Gradin and Ana Maria Aguerre (both CONI- CET) continue research in the area Rio Pinturas, as a subunit of the Programa de Investigaci6n y Desarrollo de la Arqueologia de Santa Cruz, coordinated by Au- gusto Cardich (UNLP), and under the auspices of the CONICET. At mid-course of Rio Pinturas, a cultural sequence has been obtained beginning by 9410 ? 70 B.P. (CSIC- 514). Five cultural levels are distinguished (Rio Pin- turas I/V) and associated with variations in rock art (stylistic groups A, B, B,, C, and D). At Caiiad6n Char- camata and Estancia La Magdalena, archaeological as- semblages afford excellent chances for the study of the nature of occupations, technology, functionality, en- vironmental adaptation and advantages, and an insight into the world of prehistoric hunters through the study of the diverse artistic modalities. Several burials have also been found, allowing further anthropological stud- ies on the last stages of local occupations. The research team includes Carlos L6pez, Hugo Nami, Nora Fle- genheimer, Teresa L6pez, and M6nica Ber6n. Under the auspices of the "Ente Ejecutivo Casa de Piedra" and authorities of Rio Negro and La Pampa Provinces, Carlos Gradin and a team including Ana Maria Aguerre, Antonia Peronja, and M6nica Ber6n, continues studying the hunting-gathering groups of the Middle Colorado River in a salvage project due to the building of the Casa de Piedra Dam-reservoir. The en- deavor, begun in 1977, is allowing the researchers to trace links between Northern Patagonia and the Sub- andean area from at least 8620 ? 190 B.P. (1-12067). Present research of upper levels and surface collections in the area yielded a sort of pottery that has stimulated the researchers to extend their comparative studies to the center of the Rio Negro, trying to clarify the dif- 187</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ferences between the industries of the "Patagonia com- plex" and those of Northern Patagonia. Mario Jorge Silveira (ICA, FFL, UBA) is directing the "Proyecto Arqueologia Traful," in the Nahuel Hua- pi National Park, south of Neuqu6n Province. This project, begun in 1981, tries to analyze human occu- pations through the double control of latitude and lon- gitude. Preliminary surveys disclosed 19 caves, 10 rock- shelters, and 13 surface sites; several examples of rock art were found. Excavations have been performed in two caves, three rockshelters, and a surface site, and all of the rock art has been documented. Aceramic and ceramic components, the latter prehispanic and post- conquest, have been determined. Seven radiocarbon dates- all on charcoal - for four of the excavated sites show a progression from 2890 ? 100 B.P. to 590 + 90 B.P. (INGEIS 2814, 2625). Ana Maria Llamazares (ICA, UBA, CONICET) is developing a methodology, inspired by linguistics and semiotics, to overcome the traditional limitations in rock art interpretation. The central hypothesis is that rock art is structured as a language under a semiotic interpretation, and consequently a model has been elaborated. Rock art, as a sign system, should be struc- tured according to a system of particular rules of in- tegration, articulation, and substitution, and it is al- leged that there can be a specific reconstruction and a tool for detection of diachronic change. Llamazares is operating in the Pilcaniyeu area, Rio Negro Province. Elena B. de Perrotta and Isabel Pereda, in coordi- nation with the Instituto de Ciencias Antropol6gicas de la Facultad de Filosofia y Letras, Universidad de Buenos Aires, are carrying out research in Estancia Llamuco and the neighboring area (Neuquen Prov- ince). Among several enterprises with the Museo Pro- vincial de Neuquen (e.g., cataloguing the rock art collection of ethnological data concerning the "nguillatun"), the study of stone structures at Laguna Los Flamencos showed the existence of circular stone enclosures used by hunters sporadically segregated from their permanent camps. At present, Perrotta and Per- eda are excavating Alero IV Tromen. The site seems to have three components: beginning with hunters of guanaco and Pteronemia pennata, and summer piii6n gatherers in a first phase, occupations continue until some 100 years ago. The three components have been dated and designated as follows: First: KN 2673: TR/AIV/RI6/90.95: 4400 ? 130 B.P. GAK 7961:TR/AIV/R/85: 3890 + 200 B.P. GAK 7960: TR/AIV/M/Piso: 4180 ? 530 B.P. Middle: GAK 8178: TR/AIV/sample 2: 2870 ? 220 B.P. Late: pottery, post-conquest elements Both researchers are analyzing the human remains of the Las Lagunas site, in collaboration with O. Men- donca and J. A. Cocilovo (both of Universidad de Rio Cuarto, C6rdoba Province). Luis A. Borrero (PREP, UBA, CONICET) continued at San Pablo 4 (Cabo San Pablo, Tierra del Fuego), the largest area for the zone (about 1,000 m2). Based on previous excavations, a hearth and a 20-m2 surround- ing area were exposed. Tools were found at one side of the hearth. Lack of essential differences at the site suggests its formation by several very brief occupa- tions, contemporaneous or not. The shallow depth of cultural remains (10-20 cm) will allow the completion of the area under study. The methodology was based on a linear sampling procedure with 10 m gaps between excavations. Radiocarbon dates place this site between 300 B.P. and "modern." With the aid of Hugo D. Yacobaccio (lithic analysis), Christine Lefevre (bird remains), and Hugo Nami (pro- jectile prints), Borrero (mammal remains) continues work on the extensive San Julio guanaco-processing site. At Piedra del Aguila, Borrero carried out new fieldwork with the excavation of a large rockshelter (Piedra del Aguila 11), repeatedly reoccupied. Hugo Nami completed analysis of the material from Pichi- Leufu 3, and found very high percentages ofbifacially- retouched flakes. Nami is now working on the deter- mination of the raw material source localities. Ana M. Aguerre (ICA, UBA, CONICET), with the collaboration of Carlos Gradin, Hugo Nami, Victor Duran, and N. Flegenheimer, keeps working in area La Martita, central plateau of Santa Cruz Province, to establish possible correlations between the Rio Pin- turas and the area south of Rio Deseado in the same province. La Martita cave 4 has documented Toldense Tradition from 8050 ? 90 B.P. (CSIC-506). There are also Casapedrense and Toldense occupations. Numer- ous sites with rock art, which are related to the Rio Pinturas area, have been recorded. The CONICET and the authorities of the Santa Cruz Province have helped financially. Augusto Cardich (UNLP), under the auspices of the CONICET, is coordinating a project designated as the "Archaeology of the North of Santa Cruz Province, between the Basins of the Deseado and Chico Rivers." It has been divided into four subprojects: 1) archaeo- logical investigations in the area of the Rio Pinturas (% Carlos Gradin); 2) archaeological investigations in the area La Martita (% A. M. Aguerre); 3) archaeology of the Lago Posadas-Rio Belgrano (% Carlos Aschero), and 4) archaeological investigations in Santa Cruz Province (% A. Cardich). Cardich indicates that the results are promising and praises the qualifications of the four archaeologists involved. Cardich has created a laboratory for the study of Paleoindians at the Museo de La Plata. Estela Mansur and Alicia Castro are the specialists in utilization traces in lithic material, using a metallographic microscope, and Laura Miotti is a specialist in bond determination. Maria Jos&amp; Figuerero Torres and Guillermo Men- goni Gonialons continue work on the archaeological plan for the Tierra del Fuego National Park. A regional survey of sites in order to evaluate settlement patterns was completed in the Lapataia Bay and River area. An ancient sea level was located at 10 m above pres- ent level and was dated at 4440 ? 120 B.P. (AC 0937). This information, together with four other places stud- ied by Jorge Rabassa (CADIC), may allow for the de- termination of the relation between landscape forms and different land use and settlement patterns. The three shell middens on Isla El Salm6n, Lapataia River, excavated in 1983-1984 have yielded dates of 1765 ? 188 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH 25 B.P. (GN 12430), 1820 + 120 B.P. (AC-093), and 1560 + 90 B.P. (AC-0938). Cultural remains are com- parable to later occupations at Tfinel and Lancha Pack- ewaia, sites excavated by Orquera et al. In 1986, collaborating with the urban salvage project of the Museo Territorial Ushuaia, a reconnaissance and evaluation of cultural resources was made along the coast of Beagle Channel from Golondrina Bay to Pipo River. More than 40 archaeological localities were found at differing altitudes from sea level to 25 m above it. One midden (15 m above sea level) revealed several depositions of molluscs, as well as several stages of bifacial reduction. By comparison with other dated as- semblages, this site was deposited within the last 1,800 years. Under the direction of Luis A. Orquera and Ernesto L. Piana (Asociaci6n de Investigaciones Antropol6gi- cas), research has continued in the Beagle Channel re- gion, together with the CADIC and the CONICET. In March 1986, excavations in Tonel I, Shumakush I, and Shumakush X were completed. The last two sites dem- onstrated that what Junius Bird supposed to be pit- houses in 1938 are annular ridges due to accumulation of garbage. Also, both sites reveal summer occupations due to local availability of guanacos, and differ from the local resource strategies seen at Tonel I and Lancha Packewaia. Shumakush I is dated back to 1220 ? 100 B.P. (AC 823) and Shumakush X to 440 + 100 B.P. (AC 832). Ernesto L. Piana, in collaboration with Miguel Al- bero and Fernando Angiolini (both of the INGEIS), is experimenting with differential response of radiocar- bon analyses on samples of different composition. They have established that the reservoir effect of the waters of the Beagle Channel on samples of Tonel's second component (ca. 6000 B.P.) reaches some 600 years in shell as well as in sea-mammal bones. Orquere kindly informs us extraofficially that Her- nan J. Vidal continues studying Bahia Valentin on the Peninsula Mitre (southeast tip of Tierra del Fuego), on a grant from the Museo Territorial de Tierra del Fuego. In 1986 he began research of a deep site with multiple occupation episodes in an area now covered with woods. Jose Luis Lanata (PREP, CONICET, UBA) contin- ues with his "Archaeological Project of the Northern Littoral of Fuegian Southeast," a subunit of the "Pro- gram of the Southeast Tip of the Fuegian Archipelago," sponsored by the Museo Territorial de Ushuaia. He is working with Hugo Nami (lithic assemblages) and Ri- cardo Guich6n (human remains). The main sites are Rancho Donata and La Picota. Lanata centers his in- terest in subsistence methods and settlement patterns. The whole project attempts to establish the resource and environment exploitation systems that may or may not have differentiated the menebenk haush from the Selk'nam and the Yamana. During summer 1985, in Estancia Maria Luisa, sev- eral shell middens were found. One of them, Los Mel- lizos, dates to 1020 ? 80 B.P. (Teledyne 13,994). Rancho Donata was reinvestigated by Lanata and Nami after A. Chapman's 1940 visit. There is a 4-ha workshop in which the specific provenience of raw material is important to determine. Lanata also sur- veyed the neighboring bay with the result that 23 dif- ferent sites and/or activity areas were found, from shell middens to glass-working shops. Lanata and Nami are conducting taphonomic ex- periments to check erosion against deposition. First results would suggest that although a shell-midden sec- tion is being unearthed due to wind action, an exper- imental shop is being covered by sediment at the same time. Jose A. Cocilovo (Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto) is sharing the direction of a project on genetics and microevolution of aborigine populations of South America with Francisco Rothhammer (Chile) and Francisco Salzano (Brasil). The project is co-sponsored by the CONICET (Argentina), CONICYT (Chile), and CNPq (Brasil). Its aims are to achieve a biological char- acterization of American populations through the study of the following aspects: intra- and interpopulational variation; geographic and chronological variation; kin- ship; metric, genetic, and epigenetic markers; origin and development of populations; sequential evolution; microevolutionary factors; peopling and migratory routes. The project also contemplates other research themes such as: relationships and biological affinities of the inhabitants of the prehistoric Puna (Cocilovo and Os- valdo J. Mendonca); physical anthropology of the Quebrada de Humahuaca (with Maria A. Bordach); populations of the Valliserrana Region [Elvira Baffi (morphometric aspects) and Maria Fernanda Torres (epigenetic aspects)]; the populations of Tierra del Fue- go and Continental Patagonia (Ricardo Guich6n); and nutritional evaluation in primary school pupils (Delia Lomafir de Kris Cavtzky). Francisco Carnese (UBA) directs the project's genetic, biometric, and demo- graphic study in Argentine aboriginal populations. CHILE. The Centro de Estudios del Desierto of the Universidad Arturo Prat of Iquique has three ongoing research projects. The first project is an evaluation of the archaeological resources of the Parque Nacional Volcan Isluga/Eastern Sector, First Region. Through a joint effort of the Universidad Arturo Prat and the Corporaci6n Nacional Forestal, with participation of Julio Sanhueza Tapia, Javier Salinas Garcia, Eduardo Nufiez Araya, Vivian Standen Ramirez, and Alejandro Santoro Vargas, this is a prospective evaluation of highland sites (high plateau of the Iquique Province on the eastern sector of the Volcan Isluga National Park). The second project is an examination of the bioan- thropology of prehistoric populations of the mouth of the Loa River, Northern Chile. The team includes Julio Sanhueza Tapia, Francisco Rothhammer Engel, Vivien Standen Ramirez, and Silvia Quevedo Kawasaky. The third project involves Sanhueza Tapia, Fran- cisco Rothhammer Engel, Carlos Merino Pinochet, Vi- vien Standen Ramirez, Alvaro Carevic Rivera, and Patricio Advis Vitaglic. These researchers are studying a colonial cemetery in the Iquique Province. A com- munal grace was used for aborigines as well as for black slaves, suggesting a possible epidemic disease. Jos6 Kaltwasser Passig is directing a staffof research- ers that includes Juan Munizaga V., Alberto Medina, Jacqueline Madrid, Ivan Caceres, Eugenio Aspillaga, Claudio Paredes, and Juan Varela. Since 1978, they 189</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY have excavated two sites located in the basin of the former Laguna Tagua Tagua in Central Chile. Achipuy is a wide burial area with four superimposed burial levels. Level I (Beta 8075: 1320 + 80 B.P.) contains human skeletons with brachioid skulls associated with pottery sherds and small stone projectile prints. Level II (Beta 2168: 5760 ? 90 B.P.) skulls are dolichoid and skeletons are placed into tombs made with conic ac- cumulations of stone. There are triangular projectile points made of obsidian, stone ornaments, mills and manos, perforated stones, atlatl rests, bone awls, and faunal remains such as frogs, fish, and birds. Level III (Beta 3473: 7060 ? 140 B.) skeletons are associated with small fauna and quadrangular and stemmed pro- jectile points, as well as bone instruments. Level IV (Beta 1453: 8070 ? 100 B.P.) skeletons have ultra- dolichoid skulls and are associated with stemmed pro- jectile points 6 to 8 cm long, manos, small fauna, and some unidentified bones of larger animals. Santa Ines, the second site examined, is 5 km from Cuchipuy. Although very disturbed, it shows two stratigraphical levels. The upper level, 0-30 cm, has pottery associated with small fauna. At 30 cm deep there are human burials in very disturbed tombs, which are associated with triangular projectile points, per- forated stones, manos, and small fauna. The lower level dates to 3790 ? 100 B.P. (Beta 14442). Under this level, and isolated, there appeared the proximal end of a fish-tailed fluted point. The Museo Regional de la Araucania reports, through Marco Sanchez Aguilera, Curator, about a series of excavations at Alero Quino I (Comuna de Traiqu&amp;n, Pcia. de Malleco, IXa. Regi6n). The work has been undertaken by Marcos Sanchez, Jorge Inostroza, and collaborators. The first 60 cm yielded a large amount of pottery sherds, together with abundant food remains (mainly fresh-water molluscs, wood snails, rodents), lithic tools, and projectile points, the latter possibly not associated with pottery. There are burials in all occupational levels. The Museo is also dedicated to the systematic sal- vage of late and Spanish cemeteries in several com- munas. Hector Mora (Universidad Cat6lica, Sede Temuco) and Marcos Sanchez A. and Jorge Inostroza S., both of the Museo Regional de Temuco, are analyzing the shapes and decoration of the "Valdivia" pottery to create a catalogue of shapes and decoration. The same project, sponsored by the DIUC Universidad Catolica de Chile and the Museo Regional de la Araucania, has excavated cemeteries with Valdivia pottery. Thermo- luminescence dating will be tried. Other archaeological tasks accomplished by the M. Regional de la Araucania were: excavation in Malalche Alto, west of Cholchol, in fulfillment of the Project Ceramica Valdivia; exca- vation in Isla Huapi in Budi Lake, where a mixed cemetery of canoes and tombs is found. Pottery in- cludes Valdivia and black polished pottery. Mateo Martinic notes that the Universidad de Ma- gallanes through the Instituto de la Patagonia began, in 1978, sustained research on the peopling of eastern- southern Patagonia, from Paleoindian times to modern colonists. San Gregorio 2 (GAK 8293: 2830 ? 150 B.P.) seems to be among the oldest sites of the central ori- ental littoral of the Magellan Strait, whereas Dungeness 2 yielded a date of 360 ? 90 B.P. (GAK 8284). These dates, plus 10 others, allow for a four-millennia se- quence that also clarifies the cultural association of the studied remains to the Prototehuelche and Tehuelche. In the San Sebastian zone, the Cerro de los Onas site was first excavated in 1983, with the second season in February 1986. The site is the oldest so far known for Tierra del Fuego (10,420 ? 100 B.P., LAB. DICARB Radioisotope), and furnishes an occupational sequence that reaches the historic Selk-nam. In the Patagonian territory, it was decided to sys- tematically survey all of the central oriental sector of Magallanes from the Precordillera to the Atlantic and the Ultima Esperanza District. The aim is to gain de- tailed data on the peopling of southern Patagonia. Ini- tial fieldwork yielded more than 30 new sites. Dominique Legoupil (CNRS), under the auspices of the Instituto de la Patagonia, is carrying out archaeo- logical studies on the canoers of western Patagonia, centered in sections of the coast of the Brunswick Pen- insula and Anglefield Island. Her interest is to deter- mine the antiquity of the peopling of the eastern coast of Patagonia. In 1985, Tom D. Dillehay (University of Kentucky and the Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia) and Chilean colleagues carried out the final season of work at the late Pleistocene site of Monte Verde. The site is laid out in two main areas, on the north and south sides respectively of Chinchihuapi Creek. The south side is subdivided into east and west areas. The east area, mostly uncovered in 1983, has the remains of residential huts. The most recent field season concen- trated on the west area, the most prominent feature of which is a wishbone-shaped structure associated with wood and woodworking activities. Excavation uncov- ered five logs that had been scraped and cut. Associated with this area were percussion-modified stones and selected natural stones, modified by cultural use. In addition, several test pits and block units were placed in the site to better understand the nature and extent of deeper buried material recovered as far back as 1979. The deeper levels yielded several stones, four with clear percussion marks or flaking scars, in association with two patches of charcoal specks and chunks found in a slight depression very similar to hearths. Radiocarbon dates for the charcoal in these hearths were processed at 33,000 years ago. Dillehay and his crew also placed test pits in another site (x-2) about 1 km upstream from Monte Verde. Cultural materials were recovered from the upper layer of MV-7 sand stratum, radiocarbon dated between 13,000 to 14,000 B.P. Although the preservation of organic remains at this site was poor, a large bola stone and three utilized flakes were dis- covered under the same peat stratum that covers Monte Verde. Several members of a large interdisciplinary research team also conducted special studies at the site during this field season. Included in this research was experimental lithic and geoarchaeological studies by Michael B. Collins (Southwest Museum of Man). Tom D. Dillehay and Chilean anthropologists from various universities continued their ethnoarchaeolog- ical, linguistic, and ethnographic work begun in 1975 on the analysis of ceremonial space, ideology, and so- [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987] 190</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH cioeconomic organization in the Mapuche culture and society. Dillehay focused his ethnoarchaeological stud- ies on spatial dimensions, mortuary practices, belief systems, and kinship networks associated with present- day earther mound building. PARAGUAY. Hugo D. Yacobaccio (ICA, UBA, CONICET) and Luis A. Borrero (PREP, CONICET, UBA) have finished their study of Ache sites around Chupa Pou, Eastern Paraguay; results are ready for publication. Bernard Dougherty CARIBBEAN ANGUILLA. David R. Watters (Carnegie Mu- seum) conducted a 10-day investigation of Fountain Cavern in January 1986. The project involved an as- sessment of the archaeological potential of the cave in view of its development as an educational and tourism facility. The site is located in the midst of the first national park established on the island. Twelve well- preserved petroglyphs were found in the front chamber of the cavern; they form the greatest concentration of subterranean rock carvings in the Leeward Islands. Three test pits were excavated to determine the depths of cultural deposits in different areas of the cavern. Pottery from the test pits and surface collections is predominantly post-Saladoid, probably of the late first and early second millennia A.D. Research was spon- sored by the Anguilla Archaeological and Historical Society and the Government of Anguilla. Funds were provided by the Canadian International Development Agency and Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Ad- ditional work on Anguilla is planned for later in 1986. PUERTO RICO. Peter Siegel and Peter Roe (Cen- tro de Investigaciones Indigenas de Puerto Rico, Inc.) have been directing excavations of a large Saladoid period site on the north coast of Puerto Rico, near the town of Vega Baja. Work commenced in June 1985. Siegel and Roe deployed a series of machine auger pits at a 30-m sampling interval. Site boundaries and an idea of the internal structure of the prehistoric settle- ment(s) have been established. Two mounded areas within the site were trenched. Three radiocarbon dates, 2060 ? 60 B.P. (Beta-14380), 1960 ? 90 B.P. (Beta- 14382), and 2300 ? 80 B.P. (Beta-14996), may be helpful in resolving the Huecoid vs. Hueycan Saladoid debate that recently has become an issue in Puerto Rico archaeology. The site is roughly circular in outline and 300 m in diameter. The weight distribution of the pot- tery recovered in the machine auger pits was used as a kind of"topographic" map, based upon 500-g con- tour intervals. This map reveals distinct high, middle, and low density areas that have been used to stratify the site for further testing. Preliminary results indicate that residential (based upon the presence of post-molds and pit features) and prepared burial areas are found in the low artifact density portions of the site. The middle and high artifact density areas generally define the periphery of the "residential areas," thus corre- sponding to a "donut-shape midden" pattern of refuse disposal observed in some lowland South American Indian villages. HAITI. In September 1985, Kathleen Deagan and Maurice Williams (Florida State Museum), along with students from the University of Florida, completed an intensive three-year topographic and electromagnetic survey and a controlled surface collection of the En Bas Saline site on the north coast of Haiti. The site is a large contact period Arawak Indian village thought to be that of the cacique Guancanacaric, and the lo- cation of La Navidad, the first Spanish settlement in the New World. Topographic and electromagnetic data indicate the village is approximately 350 m north-south by 270 m east-west. A U-shape earthen and shell midden, open- ing to the south-southwest, about 1-2 m high and 20- 25 m wide defines the site's outer limits. The portion of the site within the earthwork is relatively flat and debris-free except for a large raised midden area in the central area. Currently analyzed surface collection data indicate that these raised middens were the areas of concentrated habitation. Test excavations were con- ducted during 1984, 1985, and 1986 field seasons and on the basis of radiocarbon dates, thermoluminescence dates, and the stratigraphy, the site appears to have been a single component site occupied primarily during the fifteenth century. The presence of European fauna in undisturbed deposits verifies that at least portions of the site were occupied by Arawakan-speaking peo- ples in a traditional mode after 1492. In addition, sev- eral potential areas for the location of La Navidad have been identified on the basis of electromagnetic anom- alies and excavated data. JAMAICA. Elizabeth J. Reitz (University of Geor- gia) identified vertebrate remains from the Jamaican plantation of Drax Hall, excavated by Douglas Arm- strong (Johns Hopkins). The samples studied are from aboriginal, Great House, and free laborer contexts. Al- though the work is still in progress and the samples are small, it appears that European domestic animals con- stituted 44% of the individuals in the Great House sample and 65% of the individuals in the free laborer sample. In slave samples from the Drax Hall "Old Village" studied in 1982, domestic animals constituted 70% of the fauna with an MNI of 10. The Great House sample contained wild birds and sea turtles, neither of which were identified in the free laborer or slave sam- ples. The samples from the Great House contained somewhat more wild taxa than did those from slave or free laborer contexts. The Drax Hall samples suggest that subsistence on island plantations for both slaves and planters was considerably different than it was for these groups living on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States in the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies. BAHAMAS, GENERAL. In spring and summer 1986, Charles A. Hoffman (Northern Arizona Uni- versity) and Nancy C. Watford (under a grant from National Geographic Magazine) carried out archaeo- 191</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY logical investigations on Samana Cay, Fortune Island, Long Island, and San Salvador. In a brief survey, 10 sites were located along the central south coast of Samana Cay; two were later tested. Most were situated on a sand ridge, 6-10 m high, which lies between a bay and a large salt pond. The ridge is covered with tall grass and bush and parallels the coast for about 2 km. Offshore is an extensive reef system. SM-7, excavated by Hoffman, is located at the base of the ridge close to the salt pond. Surface pottery in- cluded Palmetto Ware and a single "trade" rim sherd incised with a Carrier-like design element. Excavations revealed that the cultural horizon is sealed with about 30 cm of overburden, carbonate sand blown over the ridge. SM-2 was excavated by Watford. It is located on the crest of the ridge. It contained Palmetto Ware, grit-tempered trade sherds, and a considerable amount of broken shell. One Palmetto sherd is a zemi-like mod- eled-incised lug similar to those found on Chicoid pot- tery in the Greater Antilles. Another Palmetto Ware sherd is painted with a dark red paint on both sides of the sherd; this may be the first report of painted Pal- metto Ware. Also at SM-2, a modeled-incised zoo- morphic stone object was found on the surface. Wat- ford recovered shell beads and bead blanks in various stages of manufacture, and a large quantity of small- 2 to 4 cm across-fragments of cracked conch shell. A few meters away were many conch (Strombus sp.) shells, partially broken. Watford postulates that shell-bead manufacturing took place at the site. These sites constitute several kilometers of prehis- toric settlements along the bay on Samana Cay, an island with little potable water today. Abandoned his- toric houses and government wells are testament to a greater quantity of fresh water in the past. Today, fish and conch are plentiful and within easy reach, and "black land" for farming is a short distance inland. The shallowness of the sites (? 15 cm) indicates tem- porary occupation, but the quantity of material (as of yet not counted) hints at something of a more per- manent nature. One of the reasons for excavating on Samana Cay was to see if late fifteenth and early sixteenth century European artifacts might be found in association with aboriginal remains. No historic objects were found in either excavation. Hoffman and Watford located two sites on Fortune Island (Long Cay); one near Albert Town on the north coast, and one on a sand ridge on the south coast. The site on the north coast has been disturbed by construc- tion over the past 200 years. Only "trade" sherds were found, tempered with quartz sand. The site on the south coast is on a grassy sand ridge that lies between the sea (The Bight of Aklins) and a salt lagoon. It is only about 3 m above sea level. It is characterized, on the surface, by Palmetto Ware pottery. About 200 m distant, across the salt lagoon, are several natural wells in the lime rock, in which there is a great quantity of fresh water. Conch, crawfish, and fish abound imme- diately offshore. One site was located in a small embayment on the east coast of Long Island east of Gordon settlement. Again, characterized by Palmetto Ware pottery, this site is on a low rocky ridge projecting out into the embayment. In the latter are numerous shell fishes; to the west is "black land," good for farming. SAN SALVADOR, BAHAMAS. Several sites are being investigated on this island, all through the CCFL Bahamian Field Station. In addition, analyses are in progress on the nature of the ubiquitous Palmetto Ware. Hoffman and Watford continued excavations in June 1985 and summer 1986 at Long Bay. This site contin- ues to yield both cross-hatched incised Palmetto Ware rim sherds and historic Spanish melado ware, in as- sociation. The cross-hatched pottery should be further refined as a type, going beyond MacLaury's 1970 def- inition. Mary Jane Berman (Hartwick College) conducted a third field season at the Three Dog Site on the south- west end of San Salvador, during January 1986. Work was confined to the midden and the activity area. A thin, shell-tempered, oxidized ware, conforming to a thin version of Palmetto Ware continues to be found, as does a thin, shell-and-limestone-tempered red- slipped reduced ware. Textured Meillacoid (trade ware) sherds and chert flakes resembling those associated with manioc graters were also found. Other recovered items include beads; tortoise, fish, and iguana bones; clumps of untempered clay; and coral artifacts. Ken Pfrommer, project manager, analyzed shell-bead manufacture. Finished beads and bead blanks have been excavated. A fourth field season is planned for January 1987. Ber- man worked out of the CCFL Field Station. Robert Morris (Wittenberg University) and John Winter (Molloy College) continued work on the Man Head Cay site, off the northeast coast of San Salvador. The site appears to have been a food procurement area. The remains of 19 different marine species have been recovered. Locally made shell-tempered sherds were found with Meillacoid style decorations. Mark Gilstrap (Indiana University) and John Winter (Molloy) continue their study of the chemical com- position of the prehistoric ceramics of the Bahamas. Using inductively coupled plasma analysis, they found that the imported ceramics were high in silicon and sodium, whereas the domestic ceramics were high in calcium, strontium, and yttrium. In another quarter, C. John Mann (University of Illinois) is carrying out research into the composition and origin of material in Palmetto Ware. His thin- section and X-ray diffraction analyses indicate the Pal- metto Ware from San Salvador is composed of angular fragments of invertebrate shells bound by clay and quartz. The source of the clay and quartz apparently was soil formed from dust accumulating over thou- sands of years by atmospheric deposition of material transported from North Africa. All of the sherds tested contain angular to sub-angular fragments of white cal- cite, which may comprise 30 to 50% of each sherd. Rum Cay, Bahamas. John Winter (Molloy) exca- vated a test square at the Melville site on Rum Cay. Charcoal samples yielded radiocarbon dates of 1030 + 100 B.P. (Beta-11282) and 940 + 50 B.P. (Beta-12132). These dates are within one standard deviation of each other and should be considered indistinguishable. Im- ported decorated sherds of the Mellacoid style were 192 [Vol. 52, No. 1, 1987]</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT RESEARCH recovered from the site, as well as locally made shell- tempered ware. Abaco, Bahamas. Jerry Stipp (University of Miami), John Winter (Molloy) and Dan Wiltfang (Uni- versity of Iowa) continued work on a surface site at Casuarina Point, Abaco. Three conch shells (Strombus gigas) analyzed by the University of Miami yielded radiocarbondatesof980 ? 40B.P.(UM2761),1780 ?60 B.P. (UM 2762), and 980 ? 40 B.P. (UM 2763). This site yielded only shell-tempered ceramics. Charles A. Hoffman ~~~~I U . S ~~~~~~~~~~U.S. rOlt.l R*erlic STATEMENT OF OWNERSHIP MANAGEMENT AND CIRCULATION Rrquird by 39 U.S.C. 3685J 1 A.
