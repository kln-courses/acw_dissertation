<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ojibwa Dance Drum: Its History and Construction. By Thomas Vennum, Jr. Smithsonian Folklife Studies, 2. Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1982.

Surprisingly few scholars have studied the construction, use, and meaning of the drum among American Indians. Thomas Vennum, Jr.'s The Ojibwa Dance Drum begins to fill this void in the literature of ethnomusicology; it also provides a model of how musical instrument research can be conducted among American Indians. This work represents the collaboration over more than fifteen years of William Bineshi Baker, Sr., an Ojibwa drummaker and singer, and Vennum, an ethnomusicologist. The volume is divided into two parts: "History" and "Construction." Part one explores Ojibwa music and culture, the origin and history of the dance drum, the Drum Dance ceremony and its function, and the decline of the</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 113 Drum Dance. Part two describes each step in building and decorating a tra- ditional Ojibwa dance drum and its accessories, which include pipes, tobacco boxes, support legs, drumsticks, and covers. The book is amply illustrated with over one hundred photographs, drawings, diagrams, and maps. A glossary of Ojibwa terms is also included. The companion film, "The Drummaker," contributes a living dimension to the study by showing William Baker build and decorate a traditional Ojibwa drum. Baker himself narrates the film; a complete transcription of the soundtrack appears in the book's appendix. The Ojibwa people are widely dispersed in the western Great Lakes region, including northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. The Drum Dance ceremonial originated among the Ojibwa during the late nineteenth century, after they had been settled on reservations for nearly fifty years. The Ojibwa ceremony had its roots in the Sioux Grass Dance, which had evolved from an Omaha warrior society known as the Hethushka. Vennum provides an excellent summary of the practices associated with the Grass Dance as well as its diffusion to and transformation by the Ojibwa. Integral to the Grass Dance ceremony was the large drum used to accompany the associated song repertory. As the Ojibwa received the Grass Dance, they began to view the drum itself as a sacred object invested with special power. Vennum describes Ojibwa attitudes toward the drum and the anthropomorphic characteristics they ascribed to it. The large dance drum became the central icon of the new ceremony, and, as Vennum demonstrates, the Ojibwa devoted great time and care to its construction and decoration. Vennum provides a wealth of information on the origin narrative underlying the Drum Dance ceremony, the structure of the Drum societies that performed the ritual, the symbolic content and function of the ceremony, and the asso- ciated song repertory and subrites. The Drum Dance ceremony is clearly a nativistic movement, somewhat like the Ghost Dance, with localized pan-tribal involvement. The ceremony's relationships to the Sioux Grass Dance and contemporary pan-Indian powwows demonstrates the need for a thorough reassessment of the powwow in the ethnomusicological literature. In recognition of the significance and scholarly achievement of The Ojibwa Dance Drum, Vennum received the Klaus Wachsmann Prize in 1989 from the Society for Ethnomusicology. This book is easily accessible to a broad audience but will be of particular interest to those in ethnomusicology, anthropology, folklore, Native American studies, and ethnic studies. The film is appropriate for classroom use, but it is helpful to have copies of the soundtrack transcription available because the narration can be difficult to understand.
