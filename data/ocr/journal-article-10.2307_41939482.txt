<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Rhetoric of Intelligent Design: Alternatives for Science and Religion Celeste Michelle Condit In because public arguments debate, the are motives judged behind (and should advocacy be) are by their always combination essential to of analysis, ethos, because arguments are judged (and should be) by their combination of ethos, pathos, and logos. To understand and assess the arguments over intelligent design, we must therefore consider the fundamental motives of the advocates. Most advocates of intelligent design seek to increase the scope of religious dis- course, raising its social status compared to that of scientific discourse, especially by including it in the curricula of the public schools. On the other side, the motive of most opponents of intelligent design is to protect the relative position of science in society and especially to protect scientists' control over the content of school curricula. Understanding these motivations is crucial to analyzing this debate, because whether or not one finds the arguments in favor of intelligent design to be per- suasive seems to be almost exclusively dependent on whether one already believes in an intelligent designer. Given that there is no definitive scientific proof possible either for an intelligent designer or for the absence of such a designer, this strong role for predispositional biases is to be expected. However, we can employ a useful heuristic to illuminate the relative probity of the intelligent design argument by replacing the assumption that the intelligent designer specified in the advocacy of intelligent design is something like a Christian God with the assumption that it is something more like aliens from another quadrant of the galaxy. Such a device will, I hope, productively upset pat assumptions on both sides of the debate. In the fol- lowing essay, therefore, I will review the three major arguments for intelligent design - the origin of life, the origin of species, and Behe's functionalism - assum- ing that the question at issue is whether evolution produced life on Earth as we know it or whether space-faring, intelligent, nonhuman species brought life to Earth.

To develop his ethos and destroy that of his opponents, Meyer provides a his- tory of the scientific search for the origins of life. His first stopover on this review is the "random chance" argument. Meyer argues that the universe could not have been created by random, chance combinations of the physical materials of the planet because there has been insufficient time in the history of Earth to develop the avail- able combinations. If we were to assume, however, that the "intelligent designers" of life on Earth were space-faring aliens, there would be no necessary conflict between random chance and the intelligent design hypothesis. There very well may have been plenty of time for life to originate by chance on the planets from which our space-alien benefactors hail. Consequently, we could safely note in our children's textbooks that life on Earth was created by space-faring aliens and that life origi- nated by chance combinations of the physical attributes in the universe. Although many religious persons have long been content to reconcile religion and science, the possibility of coexistence may not settle the matter for many scien- tists, who really do not like the space alien hypothesis because there is no material evidence of space aliens. Most scientists may still, therefore, prefer the other option that Meyer addresses - that life is the emergent product of loaded physical dice. Meyer's arguments on this contention are too seriously flawed to shake their faith. The first problem is that Meyer commits the fallacy of composition and division when he complains that self-organization of DNA is impossible and so life could not have organized itself. No one of whom I know thinks that DNA spontaneously organized itself from simple chemical elements. The general belief is that DNA evolved from simpler units which themselves spontaneously (and then evolution- arily) organized.1 We do not have scientific evidence for what those simpler units were, or what the path of their evolution might have been. However, this does not make "space aliens" a better hypothesis for the origin of life on Earth, for we do not have scientific evidence for what our space aliens looked like or how they behaved, either. Meyer's argument here, however, leans on the character of DNA as a pro- ducer of "information" and order. The problems with the scientific usages of the "information" metaphor with regard to genetics have been thoroughly dissected, so it would not be surprising to find that these information metaphors do not provide an adequate defense against intelligent design: they do not provide an adequate account of biological processes in the first place.2 Unfortunately, Meyer and Dembski do no better with these terms. They muddle mechanistic and teleological visions of "information," producing a bizarre, but explicable error. Twenty-five hundred years of investigation into discourse systems tells us quite clearly that "information" is always in the eye of the beholder, because "information"</page><page sequence="3">The Rhetoric of Intelligent Design 595 depends on conventions and what a receiver of "information" already knows. Dembski admits as much, and Meyer notes that information is recognizable by its ability "to perform a [communication] function." Their examples, therefore, prove the opposite of the point to which they use them. If one does not speak English or understand the conventions of printed language, the squiggles on a page, "Help! Our house is on fire!" (to use Meyer's example of complex, specified information as "meaningful") have no more specificity than "Abed Qrtp- 2@mnp rr t+ g*$4q," and Chinese is really no different than patterned vocal gibberish to those who do not understand Chinese. That does not mean, however, that where we see pattern there is necessarily a meaningful or "designed" structure underneath. The fact that a set of non-Chinese-speaking scholars can recognize Chinese as a meaningful language even though we cannot understand it merely means that we have the contexts for those squiggles formed in a system of social conventions. The million monkeys typ- ing could equally produce those sets of squiggles given enough time (and our space aliens have infinite time). There are thousands of natural patterns that are clearly not the product of intelligent design (sand ripples, volcano spacing, radio waves from pulsars). Only when the frame is specified can a pattern become meaningful infor- mation. In other words, the specification that turns a pattern into meaningful "infor- mation" is applied as much by receivers as by senders. The human tendency to read most patterns as "meaningful" (e.g., tea leaves, astrology, weather predicting) locates complexity and specification as a product of human pattern reception, not as a sign of space-alien intelligence in action. The writings of Kenneth Burke long ago illumi- nated why we are prone to reverse this relationship. Kenneth Burke notes that human language features dramatism as a fundamental characteristic. That is, all natural human communication is structured to include an agent, act, agency, purpose, and scene.3 Consequently, all human discourse tends to recount the world in terms that presuppose human-like agents and purposes. Thus most, if not all, so-called "primitive" tribes are animistic, attributing "spirits" (agents and agency) to natural objects. Nonliterate human groups are not alone here; all humans easily infer design from pattern. Even scientists can routinely be caught in anthropomorphic talk (I remember my physics teacher offering the following expla- nation: "the ball wants to get to the lowest possible energy state"). But such attribu- tion of agency and purpose is as much about us as speakers of natural languages as it is about the characteristics of the natural world. Thus, Burke argues, whether or not there is a God, our language forces us to invent one.4 God is the linguistic embodiment of perfected agency, inevitably inhabiting our language because our language is hierarchical, demanding perfection, and because our language presup- poses agency. In some sense, then, science is simply the process of inventing lan- guages that wring dramatism out of our perceptions and discourse. The intelligent design advocates attempt to co-opt this scientific approach by employing quantita- tive measures of information in order to circumvent the possibility that specification</page><page sequence="4">596 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs is simply a matter of human interpretation. Their measures, however, require prior conventions embedded in dramatistic systems - specifically statistical thresholds chosen by experimenters and the covert blocking of measured units. Therefore, while DNA clearly interacts with other chemicals in a patterned way, this does not mean that it inherently carries "meaning." The patterns are only mean- ingful, only a true code, once a function is assumed - the replication of the code. But DNA does not "intend" to replicate itself. It is not intelligent (nor necessarily the work of an intelligent species). It simply does replicate (in conjunction with the cell). That is simply the biophysical character of DNA, and therefore, that is the nature of life. Once life - as the self-replication of a pattern - does come into being and does function in that fashion, then we can circle back and talk about the code of life. But that is to say that life itself creates the possibility of meaning (that is, of "information"). To get to this point, however, no one had to intend it to function in this way. Purpose is thus a product of life, rather than life having purpose to begin with. Intelligent design thus simply repeats the pattern of the long history of the advo- cacy for the existence of God; it constitutes a linguistic tautology. This tautology recurs because we are predisposed to see design in any pattern - our language sys- tems put it there. We are the design-perceiving and thus designer-inferring crea- tures. The balance of proof in the intelligent design argument with regard to the origin of life thus rests today roughly where the creationism and creation science debates always have. Moreover, the effort to alter this resting point overlooks the very important problem that even if we explain life on Earth as the product of a space-alien vacation here, our scientific selves would still be driven to ask how the space aliens themselves came into being. The problem persists even if our intelligent designer is the Christian God. If I concede that God created life on Earth, the ama- teur scientist in me still wants to know "who made God" or "how did God come to be"? So putting the "space aliens did it" answer into the classroom textbooks would only sidestep the scientific issues; the scientific questions about the origins of life would still be at issue. Speciation Having briefly re-sorted the deck on the issue of the origin of life, we turn to the second major theme of the intelligent design advocates - that species have not evolved from each other or a common source, but rather that an alien life form planted different species on Earth when they came on their fly-by visit. Jonathan Wells and Paul Nelson here again take a page from the creationism and "creation sci- ence" books, arguing that there are missing links in the tree of life. These perceived gaps, they believe, cast definitive doubt on the possibility of evolutionary links between animal groupings. The intelligent design advocates add a set of putative</page><page sequence="5">The Rhetoric of Intelligent Design 597 functional gaps in the DNA record to the older concern about the gaps in the fossil record, but again these arguments founder on linguistic problems. First, let us explore the extent of the "gaps" that exist. It has become increasingly evident across the past century that "species" are partially arbitrary categories.5 That is, boundaries between species have become so difficult to draw that it is difficult to find any definitive "gap" at all between many species. Reproductive isolation (the biological gold standard of speciation) is sometimes less than absolute and may vary over time. Moreover, in some species, recent DNA studies show greater varia- tion within species across geographic ranges than variation between well-accepted species (for example, eastern and western gorillas differ more from each other than bonobos differ from common chimps).6 It is pretty difficult to argue that there are definitive "gaps" in the evolutionary processes between species when scientists can- not even draw clean boundaries between species, and when species vary internally more than they do comparatively. Because the argument that there are gaps in the evolution between species so evidently fails, however, intelligent designers up the ante to the level of phyla. The structure of the issue is the same, however, at the level of phyla - the ques- tion remains, when are gaps really "too large" such that they constitute difference or isolation rather than simply being "neighborly"? The size of the gaps at the level of phyla are, of course, apparently larger than those at the species level. After all, that is the whole principle of the classification system - that phyla mark greater differences than species. However, the problems of definition recur here as well. When I studied high school biology, we were taught that there were 10 phyla. A recent classification system lists 35 different phyla. Part of this difference in classi- fication is change through time, part is high school vs. specialized science, and part of it rests with differences of philosophy among the classifiers themselves. Each of these causes simply emphasizes that even distinctions among phyla require par- tially artificial judgments of sameness and difference. Therefore, we ought not take the "differences" among phyla too seriously. If we cannot even agree definitively for all purposes and times and usages where the boundaries between these cate- gories lie, it seems rather bizarre to argue that there are "gaps" between these groupings that are so great as to make evolutionary relationships among them impossible. It is again the structure of language that misleads us here. When we are playing with the terms "similarity" and "difference," we are always applying relative terms, so it is foolish to use such categorizations and terms as proof of definitive bound- aries. We are seduced to do so because the nature of language - the process of nam- ing as an act of objectification - asks us to see and treat categories as discrete and isolated from each other. However, that linguistically constructed isolation should not then be interpreted as meaning that the categories are too isolated to allow his- torical traverse between the real families of these entities in history. Measures of</page><page sequence="6">598 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs "gaps" should not, therefore, refer simply to verbal categorization, but must consist in some definitive sets of criteria, which intelligent design does not provide. Wells and Nelson also try to buttress their argument with the theoretical claim that large gaps (the large putative gaps between phyla) are difficult to traverse through mutation, since large gaps are hard to cross. I am not sure where there are any large gaps between phyla, but if we were to assume for purposes of argument that such gaps exist, it is not at all clear that large gaps are mutationally prohibitive. As with small gaps, mutations that create largely different entities will most often fail, and sometimes succeed.7 The fact that these successes are very rare might account for the fact that there are (at most?) only 35 phyla; only 35 times has dif- ferentiation at the level we identify as the substantial change of phyla succeeded. It seems easy to imagine such successful mutations happening 35 times in all of Earth history (though it is also still easy to imagine that the space aliens brought just 35 basic types with them on their ship). Of course, if large jumps can (very rarely) be made of this nature, then one would not expect to see intermediate forms in the fos- sil record, even if the fossil record were far more complete than it possibly could be over hundreds of millions of years, with most differences not manifested in ways that can be preserved through fossilization. For several reasons, therefore, the spe- ciation and existence of multiple phyla on Earth do not require us to presume an intelligent designer of any sort. Function, Evolution, and "Irreducible Complexity" The public arguments of the intelligent designers with regard to the origin and speciation of life on Earth are easy to defeat via the "space alien" heuristic. If there is a lack of time on Earth and a gap in the fossil record, then it is as reasonable to assume that space aliens brought life to Earth as it is to believe that God created it here. Neither God nor space aliens offer definitive physical records of their actions and existence. Michael Behe's functional argument, however, reaches to the nature of Gods and space aliens themselves. Behe argues that there are "irreducibly complex" biological systems and that such systems require a designer. If true, such a claim would privilege a nonbiologi- cal designer (presumably someone's version of "God") over alien biological design- ers (space aliens), at least somewhere in the universe. But irreducible complexity is chimerical. While systems may appear to be "irreducibly complex" based on a select function that is performed in a select way, multifunctionality is a general biological rule and that multifunctionality makes it easy to imagine how a complex interde- pendent system can evolve without a designer. Let us start the re-imagination process with a simple case, outside the biological world. Consider a so-called "natural bridge." A natural bridge can be used in the same way as an artificial bridge - to cross over a valley - but unlike an artificial</page><page sequence="7">The Rhetoric of Intelligent Design 599 bridge, no one had to design it. The natural arches of rock that constitute "natural bridges" are interpretable on naive glance as "irreducibly complex." Because they have an arch structure, their formation appears to entail a mutual support that can only be gained in human architecture through temporary bracing. Hence, we might assume that an intelligent designer would have had to construct natural arches using temporary braces to hold the structure in place until the last, self-bracing sup- port (the top, arch-stone) was in place. But of course, natural bridges are neither GoÄs "bridges" (that purpose is imputed by humans), nor artificially constructed. Instead, geological processes form natural bridges. Rock beds are laid down by sed- imentary processes and then selectively eroded from below. Similar re-imagining works equally well with all of Behe's so-called irreducibly complex biological machines. For example, it really does not take great imagination to provide an account of how cilia might have evolved. The original components served different isolated functions (as Behe notes scientists have already demon- strated). Some linking components brought these components together such that they performed a new function. The architectural "brace" provided by these earlier linking components was supplanted by the evolution of other components that provided superior functions, so the earlier braces "eroded." Today, to achieve func- tionality requires all of the parts of the cilia to work in tandem. But that does not mean that the parts had to appear there simultaneously, or that we see today any- thing like all of the historical components. The "braces" that constituted key steps in the evolution of cilia have been eroded by evolutionary processes, but that does not mean it was impossible for them to have been there. Scientists are inhibited from providing such speculative evolutionary accounts in the cases Behe employs because they cannot prove them according to scientific crite- ria. The scientific discourse system requires experimental or empirical evidence of the existence of these components and such evidence is unlikely to exist. Which is to say that science is much better at describing current function than it is at providing his- tories, especially when that history is long-term and refers to events that by their nature were unlikely to be recorded. Nonetheless, we do have evolutionary histories that explain many apparently irreducible complexities. Most of the detailed work that has been done in evolutionary history that describes the development of various organs and features across species is precisely of that character; it is simply that once we have such an explanation, like the natural bridge, the organ no longer appears to be "irreducibly complex." Irreducible complexity is, therefore, a statement about our ignorance of the history of an organ rather than a proof that it could not have evolved. The Rhetorical Situation This essay can be read as indicating that "intelligent design" does not carry a suf- ficient burden of proof to justify its inclusion in public school texts or in serious</page><page sequence="8">600 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs public debate. But there is a more important function to this essay. After all, it should not be surprising that religion cannot do science better than science does. Throughout history, every time religion has tried to argue on the terrain of science it has failed. More importantly, the essay should be taken to suggest that "intelligent design" does not do enough for religious purposes. The fact that "space aliens" also constitute a possible intelligent designer suggests that religious advocates who would place their rhetorical efforts behind a defense of ID are misplacing their bets. The implication of the empirical, logical, and moral insufficiencies of religious texts in providing empirical accounts is not that science is an all-powerful discourse (for the one thing that ID arguments effectively accomplish is to point up that there remains much that scientists do not know), but rather that we should respect the particular form of religious discourse rather than trying to remake religion into an empirical discourse. All religious discourse interfaces with the realm of the human unknowable and accepts the limits of human finitude. Religious discourse is there- fore inherently nonliteral - it accepts the inevitability of human language's failure to encompass the universe totally. Religion is constantly frustrated by science because science is constantly pushing back the zone of the unknown. If religion took itself more seriously, however - instead of constantly mistaking itself for an empirical discourse - the continuing explorations of science would not constitute a problem for religion; for there is little danger that science will ever explain every- thing. Beyond this universe of experience, there always lies another. If we explain this universe, we will want to know what lies beyond it. If we trace the origin of the universe back to the big bang, we will want to know what was before that? And out- side of that? There will always be an "out there" for the scientific enterprise. This does not mean that there are no grounds of legitimate contest between reli- gion and science. Like any other set of communities, each wants a larger share of public resources and public space. Furthermore, for the good of the community, it is desirable for religion to attack science in order to prevent science from becoming the exclusive discourse of the public sphere. For, as many observers have noted, sci- entific methods are notoriously poor at offering social values. If the only discourse shared within a polity were science, that polity would lack critical ingredients for coexistence and public concordances. Other forms of social- value building face the same difficulties experienced by religious discourse with regard to the need to claim public space and resources from scientific discourse.8 At least since the time of the Scopes trial, the dynamics of this rhetorical situa- tion have led to the dominance of the accommodationist position, which renders unto Darwin that which is Darwin's and maintains religion in its own, more diffuse (but still powerful), sphere.9 The accommodationist position conceded that Darwin and the Bible could be reconciled. It is possible that science textbooks have violated that compact by teaching that science now knows what the origin of life on Earth is. My importation of space aliens in this essay should have made it clear that this is</page><page sequence="9">The Rhetoric of Intelligent Design 601 not yet the case. Hopefully, my use of this heuristic will also give scientists the space to admit ignorance without the immediate assumption that their ignorance implies a paralyzing religious hegemony. This is not to say, however, that we ought to elim- inate evolutionary theory from our textbooks or use the space of science teaching to give "equal time" to less plausible theories of speciation. I understand the frus- tration of religious authorities with these limitations - it is more difficult for reli- gions to operate without state power. But history and comparative cases around the world surely teach that the costs of a hegemonic theocratic state are at least as great as the costs of a social body where religious discourse must work without the coer- cive power of the state at its disposal. It is possible to suggest, moreover, that a reli- gion that requires such coercive and potentially violent tools for survival is a religion that has lost its way and may even deserve its extinction. Notes 1. It is precisely the separation between the physical variability of DNA and its functions that is con- sequential. That is, Meyer is wrong when he states that the medium of DNA can be separated from the information it contains, or that coding and information are "prior" to sequence specification. The fact that DNA's coding structure is variable yet also induces the production of specified amino acid sequences is precisely what has allowed living organisms to exhibit evolutionary self-organiza- tion. The relative plasticity and mutability of DNA allows practically infinite options for the orga- nization of the cell, and the self-organizing characteristics at the cellular/organismic/proto-cellular level determine which bodies of life replicate. Meyer routinely separates the facets of DNA as self- replicating and as cell directing and argues that the unique characteristics of each half of these two items (or the tension between them) proves that DNA could not have provided an evolutionary basis for life. As I have elsewhere argued, however, it is precisely the binding of these two charac- teristics in a "double coding" scheme that gives DNA a unique property in the physical world (the emergent characteristic we call "life"). Any argument against the physical/ chemical sufficiency of DNA must deal with this holistic synergy, not with the mechanical parts in isolation. Meyer makes this error because his ontology and epistemology privilege "mind-like" entities (e.g., information) over "matter-like" entities - but that is precisely a circular argument. Of course, DNA did not spring into being as it is without transition from inert molecules, and even RNA is too complex to have formed spontaneously, but the DNA/RNA relationship makes it quite plausible to see these two as stair steps in a staircase on which the earlier steps are not visible to us. In fact, Meyer's argument proves too much. If the chemical world and physical properties of DNA were as isolated as he indi- cated, no useful mutation and evolution could be expected at all. If evolutionary processes are capa- ble of making minor changes in the cell-DNA double-coded specificity, which almost no one doubts, then there is simply no reason to believe that the proto-cell/DNA system is incapable of accumulating these changes through time to create something like modern highly differentiated cell/organism systems.

I am not arguing that the categories are constructed solely from human imagination and have no material components as referential base. Rather, the material (or "objec- tive") base provides building materials that exert substantial constraints, but human language and agency carve their meanings from these blocks. The categories of species thus reflect both material features of the organisms being taxonomized and also human linguistic systems.
