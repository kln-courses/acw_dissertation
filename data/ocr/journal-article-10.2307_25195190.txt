<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kafka's Mousetrap: The Fable of the Dying Voice Chris Danta You're wrong to adopt a moral point of view. I adopt that of an animal. I am not a man among men. I am animal. ? Georges Bataille in conversation with Maurice Heine We have made the louse in our image; let us see ourselves in his. ? Michel Serres, The Parasite I. The Dying Voice Sometimes fiction acts in a gently prophetic way and by a strange coincidence a writer awakes one morning to find himself taken at his word by reality, the literary dream having become a biographical actuality. This idea is not as strange as it first sounds, especially when one considers how Aristotle distinguishes the historian from the poet in the Poetics: 'The difference/7 Aristotle writes, "is that one tells of what has happened, the other of the kinds of things that might happen" (2000: 68). Given that the poet speaks of "the kinds of things that might happen," there is no reason why fiction can't act predictively. The last story Franz Kafka wrote, "Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk," is a case in point, being poetic in just this sense of the term. It concerns a mouse called Josephine who believes herself to be gifted with the ability to sing and compose songs, but who really just cheeps like the rest of her folk and whose destiny it is to "be forgotten like all her brothers" (1979: 145). Kafka completed the piece in the spring of 1924?just before the terminal phase of his tuberculosis extinguished his voice and forced him to communicate with his friends by writing out short sentences on pieces of paper. The tragic coincidence did not escape Kafka's attention and the author remarked wryly to his friend Robert Klopstock that fiction seemed to be showing reality the way in this particular instance: "T think I undertook my research into animal chirping at the right moment'" (qtd in Blanchot 264). How should we take account of this astonishing remark in which autobiography mingles uncomfortably with autopsy? According to 152 ?

In it, the fabulous animal mimics?or, if you like, ventriloquizes? the artist's own fatal descent into silence. Before being a story about art, "Josephine the Singer" is thus a story about the death of the artist?the real rather than the metaphorical death. But what entitles Kafka to give his dying voice to an animal?or to claim that he "undertook his research into animal chirping at the right moment"? In a word, it is the feeling that he will die like an animal. What is startling about Kafka's identification with Josephine is that it is self-deprecatory at the level of the species. Rather than seeing death as what elevates him as a human above the status of an animal, Kafka reiterates the anti-humanist sentiment of Ecclesiastes 3:19: "Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal." There are two distinct parts to Kafka's comparison, both of which work to erase the distinctiveness of (the) human being. The first part is easy enough to understand: the loss of speech reduces Kafka to the level of an animal; human and animal ?Kafka and Josephine ?share the burden of speechlessness. The second part of the comparison is much harder to follow: the fact that Kafka continues to write after losing his voice changes nothing in the equation. The act of writing does not serve to elevate the human being above the animal; Kafka's literature, like Josephine's singing, remains an art of oblivion in the sense that it will not prevent him from being "forgotten like all [his] brothers." Insofar as it evokes the real rather than the metaphorical death of the author, "Josephine" recalls a significant letter that Kafka wrote to Max Brod some two years before he died. In this July 5,1922 letter, which forms a kind of literary theoretical testament or a last word about writing, Kafka puts the writer's terrible feeling of anguish before the actual experience of death into the form of an interior monologue that runs as follows: "What I have playacted is really going to happen. I have not bought myself off by my writing. [...] My life was sweeter than other peoples' and my death will be more terrible by the same degree. He is only barely possible in the broil of earthly life, is only a construct of sensuality. That is your writer for you. But I myself cannot go on living because I have not lived, I have remained clay, I have not blown the spark into the fire, but only used it to light up my corpse." (1979: 294) As Blanchot glosses this remarkable passage in his essay "The Last Word": "To write is to put oneself outside life, it is to take pleasure in one's death through an imposture that will become a frightening reality" SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="3">154 Chris Danta (261). Dedication to literature causes the writer to avoid not merely living an ordinary life but also dying an ordinary death: "It will be a strange burial," Kafka continues to Brod (now in his own voice), "the writer insubstantial as he is, consigning the old corpse, the longtime corpse, to the grave. I am enough of a writer to appreciate the scene with all my senses, or?and it is the same thing?to want to describe it with total self-forgetfulness?not alertness, but self-forgetfulness is the writer's first prerequisite" (294). Even though literature is essentially an avoidance of death, Kafka thinks the writer must still be prepared to describe "with total self-forgetfulness" how his real self, his "longtime corpse" which has never lived, is consigned to the grave. Rather than the writer's "longtime corpse," it is more specifically? and synecdochally?the artist's dying voice that is being consigned to the grave in "Josephine the Singer." Kafka says in his letter to Brod: "not alertness, but self-forgetfulness is the writer's first prerequisite." In "Josephine," the voice becomes the very thing in relation to which there is not alertness but self-forgetfulness. In Kafka, the voice is always already the dying voice; it is what allows for the self to be forgotten; it is what reveals the self's irredeemable finitude, its animal existence. Crucial to the rhetorical effect of Kafka's story is the fact that Josephine's singing? her voice?is indistinguishable from the ordinary piping of the mouse folk. As our mouse narrator observes: Among intimates we admit freely to one another that Josephine's singing, as singing, is nothing out of the ordinary. [...] So is it singing at all? Is it not perhaps just piping [pfeifen]? And piping is something we all know about, it is the real artistic accomplishment of our people, or rather no mere accomplishment but a characteristic expression of our life. We all pipe. (1979: 129)1 "We all pipe": so one's piping is no different to another's. The voice that no longer distinguishes the individual?what I'm calling here the dying voice?is the surest sign in Kafka of the individual's descent into a state of animal existence: "That was no human voice'" (1979:11), remarks the chief clerk in The Metamorphosis, of Gregor's incomprehensible, post metamorphic chirping. Gregor's inhuman speech is one of the first indications that his transformation, while fabulous, will also be fatal. "We all pipe" ?to be sure, and "Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits both: As one dies, so dies the other." The concerns Kafka expresses in his letter to Brod about the writer's relation to actual death play out in his last fiction in terms of the voice. This is a point Blanchot amplifies at the end of "The Last Word." Immediately after citing Kafka's remark to Klopstock, Blanchot concludes his essay by writing: SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="4">Kafka's Mousetrap 155 How not to evoke here his remark about the anguishing discovery of the writer when the latter, at the last moment, sees himself taken at his word by reality? "What I have playacted at will really happen." Was it like this for him? The play of speech coming visibly and painfully to its end, did he refuse to speak further of it, henceforth applying all of his attention to greeting in silence the silent approach of the event? Yet this distrust of words does not prevent him from pursuing his task of writing to the end. Much to the contrary, no longer able to speak, [Kafka] is permitted only to write, and rarely has agony been so written as this. As if death, with the humor that is particular to it, had thus sought to warn him that it was preparing to change him entirely into a writer ?"something that does not exist." (264) Here, it is as if Blanchot sums up the end of Kafka's life with a morbid riddle: What survives the dying of the voice? Not the writer, of course, who "is only barely possible in the broil of earthly life, [who] is only a construct of sensuality," but writing. For Blanchot, at least, the pathos of Kafka's final piece of writing derives from the fact that it observes the "play of speech coming visibly and painfully to its end." But, in what follows, I want to suggest that Kafka's dying voice is not merely an allegory of human art and human suffering. This is because his fictional or tropological investigation of the dying voice ?his "research into animal chirping," as he so quaintly calls it?proves otherwise than anthropocentric. "It is possible to read Kafka's animal stories for quite a while without realising that they are not about human beings at all," remarks Walter Benjamin in his 1934 essay commemorating the tenth anniversary of Kafka's death. "When one encounters the name of the creature?monkey, dog, mole?one looks up in fright and realises one is already far away from the continent of man. [...] [Kafka] divests the human gesture of its traditional supports and then has a subject for reflection without end" (122). What Benjamin notices here is that Kafka's animals leave enigmatically uni-directional "tracks" that lead only away from the "continent of man." This, I want suggest, is Kafka's mousetrap: instead of enabling a metaphorical return to the concerns of human being, instead of becoming properly anthropomorphic, Kafka's animals block the way back to the "continent of man" so that "man's fate" becomes "like that of the animal." The Metamorphosis neatly illustrates the problem. As Clayton Koelb points out: "The arrestingly innovative 'Metamorphosis' takes its beginning from 'gemeine Sprache,' from a vulgar trope equating a person with a verminous insect" (235). Although emerging from the domain of vulgar or everyday speech, The Metamorphosis lurches so unpredictably and so fantastically that it prohibits any sort of normalized return to this domain. Rather than a literalization of metaphor, as some critics SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="5">156 Chris Danta have described it (see Koelb 11-12), we might here speak of a neutralization of metaphor. According to Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in their influential Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, "Kafka deliberately kills all metaphor, all symbolism, all signification, no less than all designation. Metamorphosis is the contrary of metaphor" (22). Gregor transforms into an Ungeziefer?a monstrous vermin?in order to die as one. Kafka's animals, I am arguing, are not dramatic or metaphorical supports for thinking the human; they are not "an auxiliary to thought" (Levinas, 6). Rather, they are co-participants in an ontological standoff that Kafka stages between the species, a standoff in which, precisely, "man has no advantage over the animal." As Philip Weinstein notes: Human is to animal in Kafka neither as solution to a problem (the royal road of Enlightenment thinking, the motor of its plots), nor as problem to a solution (the desperate path attempted by a D.H. Lawrence or a Henry Miller), but rather as wry and inalterable stalemate: jackals juxtaposed with Arabs, the have of each exquisitely appearing as the other's have not. (175) If fables traditionally teach responsibility?the type of responsibility that constitutes us as human selves2?then Kafka's fables are remarkable for the way they diverge from tradition by teaching self-forgetfulness (the writer's first prerequisite). Kafka's animal stories are essentially evasive in their rhetorical strategy. They do not aim to correct wayward human behavior or to provide moral instruction; they work instead to erase the very distinctiveness of human behaviour. The metamorphosis of human into animal they present is essentially non-reversible. The human subject transforms into the animal in order to die as an animal: Josef K. dies at the end of The Trial not just shamefully but "Like a dog!" What makes Kafka's fables unsettling, then, is their fatal refusal to re establish the priority of the human subject over the animal. The moral of the story?the moment in the traditional fable that breaks the metamorphic spell by speaking directly to the human reader about truly human concerns?is either missing in Kafka, or else continues to apply equally and troublingly to the human as well as to the animal. In his "research into animal chirping," Kafka develops two basic ways of achieving a sense of self-forgetfulness. The first, because it involves the human, is violent or aggressive transformation. In The Metamorphosis, Gregor's transformation into an animal is an abrupt, linear ?and ultimately fatal?movement. Indeed, the same might be said of the ape Red Peter's transformation into a human being with "the cultural level of an average European" (1979: 254) in "A Report to an Academy." In "Josephine," by contrast, Kafka does not present self-forgetfulness as the SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="6">Kafka's Mousetrap 157 after-effect of spectacular individual trauma, but rather as the state toward which the animal community naturally tends. The mouse singer's piping, we are told, "comes almost like a message from the whole people to each individual; Josephine's thin piping amidst grave decisions is almost like our people's precarious existence amidst the tumult of a hostile world" (136). One perhaps imagines Josephine at the centre of a circle, piping to those on the circumference. Rather than drawing attention to herself, her singing instead expresses to those listening the forgetting of self?the absent center?that characterizes their mouse being "amidst the tumult of a hostile world." By effacing individuality in the very moment of its enunciation, her piping allows the other mice to turn around and face the external threats, which the narrator reminds us are constant: "our enemies [are] too numerous, the dangers lying in wait for us too incalculable?we cannot shelter our children from the struggle for existence; if we did so, it would bring them to an early grave" (137). The mice are so embedded in the immediacy of their fraught existence that they are utterly prevented from living as individuals. When Josephine starts insisting on being recognized as an individual toward the end of the narrative, they react with characteristic indifference. They continue to see her for what she has always been for them: a kind of scapegoat whose disappearance from the center of the community promises to relieve its members of the burden?the sin, of you like?of individuality. The story concludes with its narrator predicting the final reabsorption of Josephine's individuality into the anonymous collective of her people: Josephine's road, however, must go downhill. The time will soon come when her last notes sound and die into silence. She is a small episode in the eternal history of our people, and the people will get over the loss of her. [...] Josephine [...] will happily lose herself in the numberless throng of the heroes of our people, and soon, since we are no historians, will rise to the heights of redemption and be forgotten like all her brothers. (145) It is important to recognize that this is in fact a happy ending?or that it is tragic only from the perspective of the rampant individualism the story wishes to hold in check. As Fredric Jameson notes of the ending in his essay "Kafka's Dialectic": "It is as though this ultimate emergence of the collective voice, of the people's impersonal narrator, was the final stroke in the eclipse of those individual characters or named personalities of which Josephine was the last. Her disappearance is thus a peculiar and yet self-defeating triumph of the collectivity, to which its dialectical union of opposites lends a single piping note indistinguishable from SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="7">158 Chris Danta silence" (112). It is not just our mouse narrator who considers it most proper for Josephine's individual peculiarity to be reabsorbed into the "quintessential anonymity" (Jameson 112) of her people; Kafka does too. According to Peter Pesic: "the fundamental and original state of the world [as Kafka represents it] is an unbroken wholeness of beings which are not distinct. They are numerous but still identical, like the three visitors that came to Abraham in his tent [in Genesis 18] or the defendants sitting in the shadowy antechambers of the law courts or the silent sirens" (189). "Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk" surely represents the culmination of Kafka's research into the indistinct. Indeed, the mouse folk privilege the identical over the different to such a degree that even their heroes, or exceptional individuals, are said to exist somewhat indistinctly as a "numberless throng." The indistinct hero (another Kafkan oxymoron) belongs to a world without historical progress, a world that takes place?like the narration of "Josephine"?entirely in the present tense. According to Benjamin: "Kafka did not consider the age in which he lived as an advance over the beginnings of time" (130). Instead, he used the mouse folk to illustrate the prehistoric rhythms of collective survival. In a fascinating remark to his young friend Gustav Janouch, Kafka recasts the anti-humanist sentiment of Ecclesiastes 3:19 in thoroughly Darwinian terms. He says: "We set ourselves above nature. We are not content to die and to survive merely as members of a species. Each of us wishes to possess his life for as long as possible as an individual organism. This is a rejection, by which we forfeit life" (Janouch 71-2). For Kafka, the wish to die as an individual?with one's difference from the rest of the species somehow preserved in advance against the work of oblivion?is a distinctly human yet equally counterfeit desire. It is human to aspire to persist as an individual over and against the collective; but this aspiration is also a rejection of the very basis of life, which is collective survival. What else is Kafka doing in his last story, then, but monumentalizing his somewhat Darwinian remark to Janouch? "Josephine the Singer" is a study of what it means to survive at the level of the species rather than the individual?and the work resists being anthropocentric precisely to the extent that it privileges the species (an animal value) over the individual (a human value). Kafka does not present the death of exceptional individuals like Josephine as an end in itself (this would be truly morbid), but treats it instead as a prelude to the experience of collective?or animal?being. It is tempting to say that Kafka would not know how to end his stories SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="8">Kafka's Mousetrap 159 without the animal. It is by appealing to the experience of animality, at least, that he offsets the often-tragic circumstances of his isolated protagonists and thus gives his stories their "final upswing" (Jameson 111). Take "A Hunger Artist," for example. Just before dying, the hunger artist admits to the overseer of the circus that he fasted simply "because [he] couldn't find the food [he] liked" (1979: 90). "The suicide only kills himself out of impotence" (Janouch 45), Kafka once told Janouch. But the end of "A Hunger Artist" immediately offsets the morbid focus on the protagonist's suicidal impotence by drawing attention away from the human death and toward "the vibrancy of sheer life" (Jameson 111). After the hunger artist is buried, "straw and all" (1979: 90), his cage is immediately cleared out to make way for an exuberant young panther: "Even the most insensitive felt it refreshing to see this wild creature leaping around the cage that had so long been dreary" (90). Whereas the fasting of the hapless hunger artist ends up expressing a paradoxical form of necessity?as he is dying he uses a famous expression of Luther's, "I can do no other" (Pascal 126)?the spectacle of the caged animal becomes a compelling embodiment of freedom for its onlookers. The final words of the story describe the aura of vitality surrounding the panther: His noble body, furnished almost to bursting point with all that it needed, seemed to carry freedom around with it too; somewhere in his jaws it seemed to lurk; and the joy of life streamed with such ardent passion from his throat that for onlookers it was not easy to stand the shock of it. But they braced themselves, crowded round the cage, and did not ever want to move away. (90) "A Hunger Artist" concludes with creaturely vitality momentarily eclipsing human decrepitude, with the Jaws of Life literally swallowing up the all-too-human tragedy. The crucial point to grasp here is that Kafka makes the appearance of the animal somehow dependent upon the effacement of the human being. Animals, I am arguing, are key to Kafka's entire enterprise insofar as they alleviate the burden?or the "sin"?of human selfhood, inasmuch as they allow author and reader alike to experience a sense of self-forgetfulness. Even the end of The Trial depends, for its rhetorical effect, upon the animal displacing the human. "'Like a dog!' he said; it was as if the shame would outlive him" (2000: 178): here, the shame of Josef K.'s summary execution outlives him on the strange condition that the animal momentarily takes his sacrificial place. Josef K.'s dog simile lends his extraordinary situation just enough generality for the reader to experience?or to share in?the shame of it. Benjamin remarks parenthetically in his essay "Some Reflections on Kafka," perhaps with this very scene uppermost in his mind: "(Being an SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="9">160 Chris Danta animal presumably meant to [Kafka] only to have given up human form and human wisdom for a kind of shame [...].)" (144). But couldn't we equally reverse the anthropocentricism of this statement and say that becoming an animal meant for Kafka giving up the shame of being human? The dog only signifies shame because it allows the particularly shameful way that Josef K. dies (with a knife through the heart) to be experienced communally. Here, then, the animal symbolically?and sacrificially? absorbs the shame of being human in order to render it communicable to others. As far as Kafka is concerned, this is not just the symbolic role of the animal; it is also the social function of the writer. As he concludes his letter to Brod by noting, the writer "is the scapegoat of mankind. He makes it possible for men to enjoy sin without guilt, almost without guilt" (1979: 295). In what is a somewhat surprising rhetorical manoeuvre, given his own interest in the question of animal sacrifice, Jacques Derrida immediately distances himself from Kafka's "zoopoetics" of sacrifice in a late text entitled, "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)." Derrida here develops a non-sacrificial account of the animal as catalyst for human shame by reflecting upon the most mundane event of his pet female cat seeing him naked. "Before the cat that looks at me naked," he asks: Would I be ashamed like an animal that no longer has a sense of nudity? Or on the contrary, like a man who retains the sense of his nudity? Who am I therefore? Who is it that I am (following)? Whom should this be asked of if not of the other? And perhaps of the cat itself? I must make it clear from the start, the cat I am talking about is a real cat, truly, believe me, a little cat. It isn't a figure of a cat. It doesn't silently enter the room as an allegory for all the cats on the earth, the felines that traverse myths and religions, literature and fables. There are so many of them. The cat I am talking about does not belong to Kafka's vast zoopoetics, something that nevertheless solicits attention, endlessly and from a novel perspective. (2002: 374, original emphasis) As in The Gift of Death, Derrida here insists upon his cat's "unsubstitutable singularity" (378); he here describes feeling ashamed before "this irreplaceable living being that one day enters my space, enters this place where it can encounter me, see me, even see me naked" (378-9, original emphasis).3 That may be so. But couldn't we equally respond, in Kafka's defense, that the irreplaceable and the unsubstitutable remain human and not animal values? From this perspective, Kafka's point at the end of The Trial is that a human being may only truly encounter the animal by invoking what is no longer absolutely singular or irreplaceable: namely, the figure of a dog.

The Politics of Animal Survival "Narration and performance in Kafka's stories serve political functions in a setting of Darwinian competition," writes Margot Norris in Beasts of the Modern Imagination. "The stake is survival" (66). If this is the case, if what is at stake in Kafka's stories is survival in a setting of Darwinian competition, then it should be noted that the animal ultimately proves "fitter" or better equipped to survive than the human. To attain a sense of freedom?albeit the negative or Bartlebyan type of freedom to prefer not to do something?the hunger artist fasts to the point of his own extinction. Human freedom thus depends for its expression upon the power of death. The panther, by contrast, expresses freedom with much greater efficiency; in its very being, without having to change its eating habits in the slightest: it "seemed to carry freedom around with it too; somewhere in his jaws it seemed to lurk" (1979:90). Kafka privileges survival at the level of the species rather than the individual?and the title of his final story makes this point with divine economy. Its first part?"Josephine the Singer"?allows us to imagine the protagonist to be a human being and, as such, irreducibly an individual. Its second part?"or the Mouse Folk"?falsifies this presumption by exposing Josephine's membership in the nation of mice. Kafka's joke, I suppose, is that an individual mouse is something of an oxymoron. He personalizes his protagonist by giving us her proper name and social profession. But he depersonalizes her by identifying her species. By shifting its focus to increasingly larger, more impersonal categories, the title neatly illustrates the erasure of personal identity that is the story's interest. Josephine tries to distinguish herself from the rest of her people through her art. But this attempted act of individuation is doomed to fail because Josephine is a mouse and mice lack individuality. For Norris, Kafka's title presents the crux of the work as a question of difference: "If Josephine can be distinguished from the mouse folk, even as an infantile brat [...] she becomes anthropomorphized, individualized, significant, and her story can be told. If not, she becomes appropriated by the mouse folk, animalized, obliterated, her story prevented" (122). What this remark crucially misses is the dialectic of the work: the fact that the prevention of Josephine's story?her ultimate reabsorption into the collective?is the point of Kafka's story. Josephine represents the anthropological denial of life that Kafka discusses with Janouch. She wishes, that is, to be human, "to possess [her] life for as long as possible as an individual organism." At one point, she even seeks recognition for her singing by campaigning for "exemption from work" (1979: 143), thereby reflecting Kafka's own lifelong wish to be exempted from ordinary labor. The mouse narrator, by contrast, represents the zoological good SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="11">162 Chris Danta sense that is constantly and good-humoredly undercutting Josephine's anthropological pretensions. Kafka spends much of the story detailing, in a typically obsessive way, the courteous standoff that takes between these two opposed perspectives: "what is entrusted to one's care one does not laugh at," explains the narrator early on in the piece. "So the people look after Josephine much as a father takes into his care a child whose little hand?one cannot tell whether in appeal or command?is stretched out to him. [...] Josephine [...] thinks just the opposite, she believes it is she who protects the people" (1979: 134). But this standoff cannot last; something has to give. How else are we supposed to read Josephine's eventual disappearance at the end of the story?the final extinction of her ever-failing voice?except as the eclipse of the irascible individual and the final triumph of the collective? When Kafka remarks to Klopstock upon losing his voice, "I think I undertook my research into animal chirping at the right moment," he begins to think his death as a problem of collective rather than individual identity. I am like Josephine, he is saying, in the sense that I will not survive selfishly, as an individual organism, but merely as a part of the species. From a psychological perspective, Kafka's identification with the failed animal-artist reveals his penchant for self-diminishment. According to Elias Canetti in his magisterial Kafka's Other Trial: The Letters to Felice, Kafka would typically respond to the show of force by withdrawing power from himself or by transforming into something small: Confronted as he was with power on all sides, [Kafka's] obduracy sometimes offered him a reprieve. But if it was insufficient, or if it failed him, he trained himself to disappear; here the helpful aspect of his physical thinness is revealed, though often, as we know, he despised it. By means of physical diminution, he withdrew power from himself, and thus had less part in it; this asceticism, too, was directed against power. [...] Most astounding of all is another method he practices, with a sovereign skill matched only by the Chinese: transformation into something small. Since he abominated violence, but did not credit himself with the strength to combat it, he enlarged the distance between the stronger entity and himself by becoming smaller and smaller in relation to it. Through this shrinkage he gained two advantages: he evaded the threat by becoming too diminutive for it, and he freed himself from all exceptionable means of violence; the small animals into which he liked to transform himself were harmless ones. (89-90, original emphasis) It is hard to imagine a creature more ideally suited to express Kafka's poetics of disappearance than the mouse. Small and harmless, the mouse has the further advantage of being a pack animal. Of course, another way to become small is to disappear into a crowd. SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="12">Kafka's Mousetrap 163 But it is perhaps not enough to account for Kafka's complex relation to power simply as an act of evasion or as a poetics of disappearance. Here, it is important to keep in mind the twofold or dialectical nature of his work. According to this dialectic, I have been suggesting, Kafka's poetics of human disappearance?his tendency to withdraw power from himself?is at the same time a politics of animal survival?that is to say, an empowerment of the animal. For Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka's narratives "are essentially animalistic even though there aren't animals in all of them" (34). What this means is that the animal serves an essentially political function for Kafka. Insofar, then, as we may truly consider Kafka to be a (minor?) political writer, I might rephrase my central problem thus: How should we account for the supremely self deprecatory gesture by which Kafka gives his dying voice to an animal as a genuinely political act? III. "Receptacles of the forgotten" The stakes of this question will become clearer after a brief digression into a work of English literature that puts the trope of the dying voice to good political use: namely, William Shakespeare's Hamlet. One of the last things Hamlet tells Horatio before he dies is that the Norwegian prince Fortinbras has his "dying voice" (5.2.335). By "voice" Hamlet here means vote; he is in part endorsing Fortinbras's election as the new king of Denmark. But the young Fortinbras has Hamlet's "dying voice" in two other significant ways at the end of the play: first, and most obviously, because he is about to occupy the position of authority that Hamlet has been denied from the start; and, second, because he is about to hear Horatio tell Hamlet's story. "Horatio, I am dead, / Thou livest; report me and my cause aright / To the unsatisfied" (5.2.317-19): by so charging his friend to tell his story, Hamlet ensures a most vocal type of survival for himself. Shakespeare's restoration of order at the end of Hamlet thus depends upon a synecdochic?and Aristotelian?reduction of the political to the human voice. What defines man as the political animal, Aristotle tells us famously in the Politics, is the gift of speech (logos). Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pain and pleasure, and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and the inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust (1999:5). SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="13">164 Chris Danta As the quintessential humanist subject, Hamlet recognizes the capacity of logos to set forth "the expedient and the inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust." From this perspective, his central concern in the play is to restore logos as the proper site of the political. The murder of old King Hamlet has had the effect of stifling political?or truly human?speech. The significance of Hamlet giving his "dying voice" to Fortinbras in full public view at the end of the play is that it re-engages politics in its properly logocentric aspect. Hamlet's greatest weapon against the treachery of his "uncle-father" (2.2.344), one might say, is the voice. The logocentric movement of the play within the play?from silence to speech?neatly illustrates this point. Part one of The Mousetrap, the dumb show, mimics Claudius' sinister politics by silently and crudely transposing onto the stage the primal scene of his murder of old King Hamlet. In what is otherwise an over determined gesture, part two, a reworking of The Murder ofGonzago, then gives voice to what has hitherto remained merely silence, or ghostly speculation. Hamlet's concern at the end of the play?much like the ghost's at the beginning?is to be remembered.4 The crucial point of difference between the two demands, of course, is that Hamlet only asks those who survive him to speak well of?or to eulogize?him. Such are the politics of the human voice that the play ends with Hamlet already being upheld by Fortinbras as a kind of hero: "For he [Hamlet] was likely, had he been put on, / To have proved most royal; and for his passage, / The soldier's music and rite of war / Speak loudly for him" (5.2.376-9). At the end of Hamlet, the exceptional individual enters into the historical archive of his people by passing his dying voice onto others. But no such possibility exists for Kafka's animals. In the case of "Josephine," this is because the mouse folk are poor in history: "generally speaking we ignore historical research entirely" (1979:135), the narrator tells us. If Hamlet is ultimately about the politics of human memory, then "Josephine" crucially concerns the politics of animal oblivion. If Hamlet's character is in some sense redeemed by Fortinbras's final memorializing speech, then Josephine achieves a sense of redemption by being forgotten by "all her brothers." In telling the fable of the dying voice?in thinking about what it might mean to die like an animal?Kafka does away with the very notion of history. Whereas "historical research" serves to memorialize and monumentalize the exceptional individual, Kafka's animals, who "are no historians," "happily lose [themselves] in the numberless throng of the heroes of [their] people." As Benjamin points out, they are "receptacles of the forgotten" (132). They teach self forgetfulness or the effacement of individuality. As Benjamin notes: SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="14">Kafka's Mousetrap 165 "What has been forgotten?and this insight affords us yet another avenue of access to Kafka's work?is never something purely individual. Everything forgotten mingles with what has been forgotten of the prehistoric world, forms countless, uncertain changing compounds, yielding a constant flow of new, strange products" (131). IV. Kafka's Mousetrap In being "receptacles of the forgotten" that carry over into the present moment a sense of prehistoric oblivion, Kafka's animals inevitably distort rather reflect the self-image of the human being. According to Benjamin: "No other writer has obeyed the commandment 'Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image' so faithfully [as Kafka]" (129). Kafka certainly does not make graven images out of his animals. He does not restore animals to the divine status they enjoyed in prehistoric times.5 But I would like to end this essay by suggesting that he does use them to attack a central biblical tenet: namely, the resemblance between the human and the divine that is outlined in Genesis 1:26: "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground'." "We set ourselves above nature," says Kafka to Janouch. "We are not content to die and to survive merely as members of a species." Kafka's fables avoid being explicitly moral or didactic, I would finally suggest, by withdrawing from human beings their divine right of authority over the animals. For Kafka, becoming an animal thus meant something quite precise: namely, denying one's resemblance to a god. We glimpse him expressing this attitude very early on?in a 1904 letter to Max Brod in which he describes transforming into an animal while out one day walking his dog. While I was out on a walk my dog came upon a mole that was trying to cross the road. He kept leaping at him and wouldn't leave him alone, for he is a young dog, and timid. At first I was amused and liked especially the mole's excitement as he looked for a hole in the hard surface of the road, altogether desperately and ineffectually. But then suddenly, when the dog struck him once more with an outstretched paw, he shrieked Ks, kss, just like that. And then I thought ?no I didn't think anything. I was simply in a state of delusion, because on that day my head was hanging so heavily that in the evening I noticed with amazement that my chin had grown into mv chest, (qtd in Canetti 90) Canetti is right to point out in his commentary of this passage that, for the mole, Kafka "is the god, the supreme being, the zenith of power, SubStance #117, Vol. 37, no. 3, 2008</page><page sequence="15">166 Chris Danta and in this case God is even present" (90). But it is just as important to recognize that Kafka gives up his advantage over the animal by empathetically hanging his head. This creaturely?and unconscious? gesture expresses not just respect for the mole, but also the shame of being human. In his fiction, Kafka further diminishes the stature of human beings by transferring their destructive powers onto other animals. The rhetoric of the mouse narrator in "Josephine" reverses the natural order of things so that it is the animal that forgets the human. The mouse protagonist of Kafka's short piece from 1920, appropriately titled "Little Fable" by Max Brod, manages to avoid a mousetrap laid out for it by humans, but proves defenseless against the predatory rhetorical skills of a nearby cat: "Alas," said the mouse, "the world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when at last I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap I must run into." "You only need to change your direction," said the cat, and ate it up. (1979: 157) This mouse is literally running for its life. But the world is growing smaller and smaller. The text conveys this shrinkage in its very rhetoric: by first proposing and then suddenly and violently collapsing the difference between two fatal destinations. Kafka's mousetrap has got nothing to do with human beings; they are tellingly absent from the scene. An animal death awaits the mouse whether it turns toward the human or the animal predator. At the heart of sheer life is sheer death? the politics of animal survival. University of New South Wales Notes 1. For an alternative account of the voice in Kafka?one that reads it in terms of the law ? see chapter 7 of Mladen Dolar's A Voice and Nothing More. In this chapter, Dolar develops a fascinating analogy between Josephine and Marcel Duchamp: "Josephine's voice is the extension of the ready-made into music. All it does is introduce a gap, the imperceptible break that separates it from all other voices while remaining absolutely the same ?'a mere nothing in voice'" (176). 2. According to Thomas Keenan in Fables of Responsibility: "What is at stake in the fable is, more than anything else, the interpretation and practice of responsibility?our exposure to calls, others, and names with which we are constituted and which put us in question" (45).

In The Gift of Death, Derrida in fact uses the "unsubstitutable singularity" of his pet cat to raise the question of sacrifice. He there asks provocatively: "How would you ever justify the fact that you sacrifice all the cats in the world to the cat that you feed at home every morning for years, whereas other cats die of hunger at every instant" (71). 4. For an interesting discussion of this facet of the play see chapter 5 of Stephen Greenblatt's Hamlet in Purgatory. 5. For a striking account of how prehistoric art impacts the human-animal relation see Georges Bataille's collection of essays, The Cradle of Humanity: Prehistoric Art and Culture. "What in the development of religious history concealed [...] the passage from the initial opposition between animality-divinity and humanity to the opposition that still prevails today, that reigns even over minds foreign to all religion, between animality devoid of any religious signification and humanity-divinity?" asks Bataille in "Prehistoric Religion."
