In his book Civilita preistorica della Valcamonica (Milano: I1 Saggiatore, 1964), Emmanuel Anati discussed at some length the rock incisions of this famous Alpine prehistoric site. But within the last ten years, thanks especially to Anati's own researches, the factual informa- tion available has increased enormously. More than 130,000 rock engravings are presently known, and their number will certainly increase still further. The importance of this exceptional mass of documents is greatly enhanced by their chronological continuity over a span of some 8,000 years. Aside from the most ancient engravings, which date to the epipalaeolithic, Anati distinguishes four periods: the "new ideologies" of the Neolithic (periods I-II), the "monumental compositions" (III A, from the Calcolithic Age), and "cult of weapons" (III B-D, of the Bronze Age), the intermediary phase (final Bronze), and the Iron Age (IV A-F). When the Roman legions penetrated into the Valcamonica valley, the indigenous civilizations were practically terminated, and by the beginning of the Christian Era, the local ethnic 178</page><page sequence="2">History of Religions groups, the Cammuni, had lost their autonomy and were eventually absorbed by the broader Italian population. The meticulous analysis of the rock incisions which Anati offers in this book brings to light a number of specific traits of the archaic Camonian culture. Particularly illuminating are the chapters devoted to the interpretation of the Neolithic and Bronze Age documents (pp. 49-94). The number and the quality of the photographs and drawings enhance the value of this excellent monograph. In the author's opinion, the rediscovery of Valcamonica is tantamount to the discovery of that "Europa libera, precedente all' espansione imperiale di Roma, di quell' Europa dove i popoli sviluppano la propria cultura mantenendo e valor- izzando le proprie tradizioni, ricercando un armonico equilibrio con il proprio ambiente e con il prossimo. Dopo essere rimasto sepolto per venti secoli, il messaggio degli antichi camuni torna a noi fresco e attuale, come nel tempo in cui fui concepito. Esso rappresenta un' eredita intelletuale e storica nella quale 1' Europa di oggi ritrova le sue profonde radici" (p. 142). 2. It was not a matter of chance that the first International Sym- posium for the Study of Prehistoric Religions was held in Capo di Ponte, Valcamonica, and was inspired and organized by Emmanuel Anati. The Acts have now been published in a sumptuous edition, which con- tains forty-nine communications organized into seven sections: Palaeolithic; European Protoneolithic, Neolithic, and Eneolithic; European Bronze and Iron Ages; Africa; Asia; America and Oceania; methodology and general problems. Each group of papers is followed by a tape-recorded general discussion (pp. 81-83, 197-206, 283-90, 437-40, 469-70, 515, 587-99). In some instances, the confrontation of different approaches and methodological presuppositions is highly illuminating, and from these discussions one can begin to judge the desperate difficulties of the enterprise. The first four communications are devoted to the analysis of Palaeo- lithic religious ideas and beliefs. Professor Andre Leroi-Gourhan ("Iconographie et interpretation," pp. 49-55) brings forward a method- ologically useful distinction between two modes of figurative expres- sions: the mythographic and the pictographic. The first "offre des rapports avec les representations mythiques ou le temps est en quelque sorte suspendu hors de la representation" (p. 52). On the other hand, the pictographic expression "introduit entre les figures la trame d'une action, il suggere un passe et un futur en-de9a et au-dela de l'action figuree et inscrit par consequent la dimension du temps reel" (p. 53). One regrets, however, that the author does not discuss Marshak's interpretations of the Palaeolithic engravings as a "system" illustrating what the American scholar calls the "time-factored thought" (cf. my review in HR 14, no. 2 [November 1974]:140-47). Contrary to his former position (defended especially in Les Religions de la prehistoire [Paris, 179</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 1963]), Leroi-Gourhan now recognizes the utility and validity of carefully chosen ethnographic parallels (p. 54; cf. p. 598). Professor L.-R. Nougier considers that a work of rock art is a function of the rock on which it is inscribed. In his opinion, the natural frame- work which surrounds it is an integral part of its deeper meaning. In this light, the author discusses the paintings of the cave Rouffignac, which he discovered in 1956, insisting particularly on the anthro- pomorphic figure, the "Grand Etre" comparable to the "Dieu Cornu" of the Grotte des Trois Freres ("Importance du choix dans l'explication religieuse de l'art quartennaire," pp. 57-64). Jose Gomez-Tabanez presents a semiological structural analysis of myths, in order to decipher the meaning of the Spanish Palaeolithic rock art (pp. 65-72). In his article ("Sobre ideomorfos de haces de lineas y animales sin cabeza," pp. 73-80), F. Jorda Cerda discusses two sanctuaries in Asturia: one, at Las Herrerias, is characterized by representations of ideomorphs (parallel lines and points); the other, at Las Pedroses, is marked by figures of headless animals. In conclusion, the author rejects the general explanation based on "compositions of sexually opposed elements." The second section is particularly rich. I may mention the important communications of Dragoslav Sregovic and Zagorka Letica on the religion of Lepenski Vir (VII-VI millennia B.C.), the famous Danubian site where what Sregovic calls "Europe's first monumental sculpture" was recently discovered; Marija Gimbutas, "Figurines of Old Europe: 6500-3500 B.C." (pp. 117-42); the article of Eugen Comsa on the anthropomorphic Neolithic figurines found in the territory of what is today Rumania (pp. 143-52); the contribution of Janos Makkay to the understanding of Neolithic sacrifices (pp. 161-73); the article of A. M. Radmill on the Italian Neolithic cults of fertility (pp. 175-83); and the communication of A. Fleming, "Analytical Approaches to the Study of Ceremonial Monuments in North-West Europe" (pp. 191-95). The general discussion occasioned some further clarification of the problem of "Old Europe" and of the religious innovations manifest in the culture of Lipinski Vir. The section on European Bronze and Iron Ages contains contribu- tions related to the rock art of the Canary Islands (A. Beltram, "Re- ligion prehispanique aux Canaries," pp. 209-20), the Aegean religions (A. Tamvaki, "On the Interpretation of Cycladic and Mycenaean Figurines," pp. 227-41; G. E. Mylonas, "New Evidence on Mycenaean Religion," pp. 243-52), the Valcamonica engravings (S. Felli, "I1 significato delle palette nell'arte rupestre della Valcamonica," pp. 263- 69), and an informative article on the religion of the Palaeo-Venetians (A. L. Prosdocimi, "La religione dei Veneti antichi: Contributi linguis- tici," pp. 271-82). The most important contributions, however, are to be found in Section IV, devoted to the prehistoric religions of Africa. Julien Ries presents a cogent analysis of the "etapes de la recherche" in the under- 180</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions standing of prehistoric Egyptian religion (pp. 239-312); John G. Griffiths points out "A Possible Anticipation of the Triad in Prehistoric Egypt" (pp. 317-22); G. Camps proposes a morphology of the many figures and scenes specific to North Africa's rock art (pp. 323-33); Andre Simoneau investigates the cosmic vision of the pastoral and metal-working peoples who first consecrated the peak of Djebel Rhat (3,788 meters above sea level) in the heart of the High Atlas range (pp. 335-44); Fabrizio Mori examines a number of representations characteristic of prehistoric Saharan art (pp. 343-66). Particularly illuminating is Germaine Dieterlen's "Contributions a l'etude des relations protohistorique entre le Mande et l'actuel Ghana" (pp. 367- 78). The author interprets the contemporary pilgrimages made by the Dogon to the Ivory Coast or the Gold Coast in the perspective of the Dogon myths of man's appearance on earth and of the journey of the mythic ancestors from the Mandingo area to Ghana. Patricia Vinnicombe presents a close analysis of "The Ritual Signifi- cance of Eland (Taurotragus onyx) in the Rock Art of Southern Africa" (pp. 379-400). She compares the predominant status of the eland in the animal paintings and rock engravings with the Bushmen's myths of the eland's origin, which relates the creation of eland to ritual prescriptions concerning its hunt. "If the hypothesis be accepted that painting was associated with a ritual involving the visual re-creation of eland, then the shelter where the blood and fat of the dead eland, mixed with red ochre, was painted on the rock, could be regarded as the 'sanctuary.' The sanctity, or strength, of these sacred paintings would then have to be renewed from time to time" (p. 395). (For an Australian parallel, see my book, Australian Religions [Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1973], pp. 80, 81.) Harold Pager confronts the same problem in "The Antelope Cult of the Prehistoric Hunters of South Africa" (pp. 401-11), and J. D. Lewis-Williams compares the Drakensberg rock paintings with some important Bushman myths (pp. 413-26). Last, G. C. Oosthuizen, after summarizing the results of the excavations carried out at the Matjes River Rock Shelter (radiocarbon dating, 7,750-11,250 years), examines the "Stone Age Affinities in Bushmen Religion" (pp. 427-35). During the discussion, Ugo Bianchi made a timely observation: "Cette seance sur l'Afrique a ete remarquable, et la documentation apportee extremement importante. En tant qu' historien des religions, je voudrais soulever une question d'ordre methodologique. Il me semble qu'un danger reside dans l'exces d'humilite des prehistoriens quand ils parlent de phenomenologie religieuse, quand ils utilisent sans qualifica- tions phenomenologiques des mots tels que: dieu, homme, animal, figure intermediare, etc. Car, en histoire des religions, il ne faut juste- ment pas partir de categories preetablis, mais au contraire etablir des categories sur la base de la phenomenologie religieuse" (p. 439). Section V (Asia) is surprisingly poor. Two papers are devoted to 181</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews Indian megaliths without contributing anything new (pp. 443-56). Dr. H. D. Samkalia publishes a clay figurine of a Mother Goddess found at Inamgaon, district of Poona, at a level dated ca. 1200 B.C. Pisit Charoenwongsa presents an overly rapid survey of "Funeral Rites in Thailand from Prehistoric to the Beginning of Historical Times" (pp. 463-67). In Section VI (America and Oceania) one may specially mention the article of W. E. Taylor, "Speculations and Hypotheses on Shamanism in the Dorset Culture of Arctic Canada" (pp. 473-82); "Religious Figures on Petroglyphs in the Upper Ohio Valley" (pp. 483- 90) by J. L. Swanger; "Burial Rites in Prehistoric New South Wales" (pp. 499-508), by Isabel McBryde, the only contribution to the study of Australian prehistoric religions; and a short article by the Finnish scholar, Aarne Koskinen, entitled "Religious Change in Ancient Eastern Polynesia" (pp. 509-14). In the last section (Methodology and General Problems), one finds a stimulating essay by Ake Hultkrantz, "The Religioecological Method in the Research of Prehistoric Religion" (pp. 519-28); "The Pre- Literate Stage of Religious Tradition" by J. Pentikainen (pp. 551-66); the substantial study of Ileana Chirassi Colombo, "Problemi per lo studio dei fatti religiosi della preistoria" (pp. 567-82); and a short article by A. Strom, "La Religione dei vivi dell' eta della pietra nell' Europa settentrionale" (pp. 583-85), in which the author rejects Jan de Vries's statement that we know nothing about the religion of the living in the Stone Age, since our only documentation is related to burials. As was expected, the general discussion revealed a multiplicity of methodological presuppositions among the participants in the congress, and in many cases, their dependence on the latest fashionable ideologies. Fortunately, one can also find some competent and responsible observa- tions and useful suggestions proposed by Leroi-Gourhan, Anati, Bianchi, Gimbutas, Dieterlen, and a few others. But one can conclude, with Emmanuel Anati, that during the symposium "a dialogue was opened up, which must be further developed" (p. 599). For this purpose, the International Association for the study of Prehistoric and Ethnological Religion was created. It is to be regretted, however, that such specialists as Karl Narr, P. G. Ucko, and Alexander Marshak had to be absent from this conference. 3. In her communication at the Valcamonica Symposium, Professor Marija Gimbutas describes as follows what she designates by the term "Civilization of Old Europe": During the 7th, 6th and 5th millennia B.C., the farmers of south-eastern Europe evolved a unique cultural pattern contemporary with similar developments in Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Syro-Palestine. The area occupied by this cultural pattern extends from the central Mediterranean, the Aegean, and Adriatic Islands, including Crete, to the Carpathian Mountains and the western Ukraine. 182</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions Between 6500 and 3500 B.C., the inhabitants of this part of Europe developed a much more complex social organization and material culture than their western and northern neighbors, forming population aggregates which inevitably evolved craft specialization and the creation of religious and governmental institutions. Their economy, based on food-production, was introduced in the Mediterranean and in southeast Europe 2000 years earlier than in western Europe, and about 3000 years earlier than in northern Europe. [P. 117] Professor Gimbutas's communication dealt with the religious signifi- cance of the figurines of Old Europe. She concluded that in such figurines and in pictorial paintings, the neolithic farmers "recreated their mythical world and the worship of their gods: primordial events, main personalities of the pantheon with their innumerable epiphanies, worshippers and participants in ritual ceremonies" (p. 136). Most probably, myths and seasonal drama were enacted through the medium of the figurines. "In making images of gods, worshippers and actors of the drama, man assured the cyclic returning and renewal of life. Many figurines were ex-voto and, like the words of prayer, were dedicated to the Great Goddess, the Bird Goddess, the Snake Goddess, the Vegeta- tion Goddess, or the Male God" (p. 137). In The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, the author expands and amplifies the argument of her Valcamonica communication. This splen- didly illustrated book brings together an archaeological documentation hardly to be found elsewhere. (Indeed, most of the material reproduced is buried in a large number of Russian, Western, and Eastern European periodicals and monographs.) The first chapter (pp. 17-35) is devoted to the regional and chronological subdivisions of Old Europe. It is followed by a brief analysis of the Neolithic artist's reality-"not a physical reality"-and the trend toward more naturalistic sculpture in the Chalcolithic Era (pp. 37-43). In the third chapter (pp. 47-56), Gimbutas presents the ritual costume, reconstructed from the decora- tive motifs found on clay figurines. "Much that typifies costumes worn during the fifth and fourth millennia in Balkan Europe can be readily recognized in the illustrations of goddesses and worshippers preserved on Minoan frescoes, statuary, seals and signet rings of the second millennium B.C. The exquisite Minoan female costume may represent the culmination of a tradition which began in Neolithic-Chalcolithic Europe" (p. 55). Investigating the morphology and the functions of masks (pp. 57-66), the author insists especially on the Vinca figurines, which are demon- strably masked (see also Gimbutas's article, "The Mask in Old Europe," Archaeology 27 [October 1974]:262-69). A majority of the Vinca masks appear to imitate birdlike features, and the same model is still used in contemporary Balkan locales (p. 65). Thus, the old European religious heritage is attested not only in Minoan and Greek traditions (cf. inter alia, the masked figures in the ritual dance scene depicted on the ring from Isopata, near Knossos, the masks worn during Dionysian festivals, etc.) but survives even today. (Along with many other examples, the 183</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews continuity of such rituals may help the historian of religions to master his innate methodological inhibitions with regard to the validity of comparison between archaic or folkloric traditions and "historical" ones.) Even more rewarding is the chapter devoted to "Shrines and the Role of Figurines" (pp. 67-88). Clay models of sanctuaries are known from all parts of Old Europe. One of the most interesting is the large clay model of a sanctuary found by Hortensia Dumitrescu in 1966 at Cascioarele, near Bucharest, and dated to the second half of the fifth millennium B.C. "So the Cascioarele edifice may ante-date the Sumerian temples by one millennium" (p. 68; see H. Dumitrescu, "Un Modele de sanctuaire decouvert dans la station eneolithique de Cascioarele," Dacia, n.s. 12 [1968]:381-94). Indeed, in a layer immediately below the stratum in which the clay model was found, a temple was unearthed dating from the early part of the fifth millennium B.C. (p. 71; cf. Vladimir Dumitrescu, "Edifice destine au culte...," Dacia, n.s. 14 [1970]:5-24). The sanctuary, sixteen by ten meters, is divided into two rooms by a row of six posts. One room has its walls painted cream on a red background; two pillars were found in this room, the larger one being about two meters high, and similarly painted. Gimbutas states that "The Minoan and Old European pillar was not an axis of the Universe, not the axis mundi of the Altaic and northern European cosmologies, but an incar- nation of the Great Goddess in her aspect as the source of life-power" (p. 80). This interpretation is probably correct for the Minoan pillar, but the one discovered at Cascioarele could have had other significations. (I hope to come back to this problem in a review of Romulus Vulca- nescu's book, Coloana Cerului [Bucuresti, 1972].) Discussing the "Cosmogonical and Cosmological Images" (pp. 89-111), the author analyzes the four corners of the world (four-fold signs incised on pottery dishes, quartered, and quatrefoil designs, etc.); the snake and its abstracted derivative, the spiral (the dominant motifs of the art of Old Europe); the primordial egg; and the fish. "The idea of a water bird, or a form of anthropomorphized bird, as a creator of the cosmic egg is clearly represented in Neolithic figurine art. It must have been a dominating theme among the cosmogonic myths" (p. 106). The last four chapters are devoted to different types of goddess and to the "Year-God" (pp. 112-239). It is the richest and the most personal section of the book, and also the most controversial. Gimbutas begins by presenting the multiple epiphanies of the bird and snake goddesses, investigating the ideograms of the bird goddess, the meander, symbol of Cosmic Waters, the Neolithic images of the bird goddess, the "Lady Bird" and the "Lady Snake" of the Chalcolithic Era, the snake and bird goddesses as nurse, and completes the chapter with a survey of anal- ogous goddesses in Minoan Crete and in ancient Greece. A remarkable morphological analysis is to be found in the following chapter, "The Great Goddess of Life, Death and Regeneration," in which a particularly 184</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions stimulating section is devoted to the androgynous and corpulent goddess with folded arms of the Neolithic period, and to the chrysalis-like god- dess with folded arms of the Chalcolithic period. Taking up the "Preg- nant Vegetation Goddess," the author brings forth suggestive remarks on the dot (seed) and the lozenge (sown field) and the pig, followed by brief allusions to Demeter and Kore. Less convincing, however, is the chapter on the "Year-God," notwithstanding the inestimable value of the archaeological documentation. In conclusion, Gimbutas reminds the reader that "in Old Europe the world of myth was not polarized into female and male as it was among the Indo-Europeans and many other nomadic and pastoral peoples of the steppes. Both principles were manifest side by side.... Neither is subordinate to the other.... The central theme in re-enaction of myths obviously was the celebration of the birth of an infant.... The pan- theon reflects a society dominated by the mother" (pp. 237-38). This earliest European civilization was savagely destroyed by the patri- archal, masculine-oriented Indo-Europeans: "It never recovered, but its legacy lingered in the substratum which nourished further European cultural development. The Old European creations were not lost; transformed, they enormously enriched the European psyche" (p. 238). MIRCEA ET.TADE University of Chicago CHRISTIAN AND HINDU TERMINOLOGY Christian and Hindu Terminology: A Study of Their Mutual Relations with Special Reference to the Tamil Area. By BROR TILIANDER. Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell Tryckeri, 1974. Pp. 310. With his recent publication, Christian and Hindu Terminology, Bror Tiliander has made a contribution to historians of religion and to historians of Christianity, especially to those interested in the interface between Christianity and Hinduism. He has examined the use of various Sanskrit and Tamil terms in the history of Christian theology in India and especially in the translating of the Bible into Tamil; he explores how the terms used are related or different in meaning with their usage in specific documents of the Hindu tradition. In the process, he gives some insight into the perceptions of Christian missionaries in South India as to the nature of Hindu thought and of Christianity's similarities to and distinctiveness from it. It is apparent that Professor Tiliander, who was himself a missionary in Tamil Nadu under the Swedish Lutheran Mission for several decades, shares many of these perceptions. Tiliander divides his discussion into five sections: (a) "elementary" terms associated with the nature of religion and religious documents 185</page></plain_text>
