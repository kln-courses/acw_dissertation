In 1949 Prof. Untersteiner published under the title cSofisti, testimo nianze e frammenti5 the first two fascicules of an Italian version of the section concerning the sophists in Diels-Kranz 'Fragmente der Vorsokrati ker5, and a third fascicule appeared in 1954. These provided a Greek text, a facing Italian translation for both testimonia and fragments, and a sub stantial commentary at the foot of the page. The present volume is the first of a parallel series to be devoted to the Eleatics, and it follows the same pattern with one exception. In the case of the sophists Untersteiner could refer from the commentary to his other published works for a fuller exposition of his own particular views and there was no introduction. In the present case a long introduction provides a full discussion of the life, works and thought of Xenophanes and is by far the most important part of the book. It presents Xenophanes as a profound thinker with an essentially new and philosophic insight into the nature of reality. Untersteiner begins with the problem raised by the section dealing with Xenophanes in the work De Melisso Xenophane Gorgia usually regarded as of Peripatetic origin, possibly from a late period, and of little or no value for the reconstruction of Xenophanes' thought. He puts for ward the view that it was written about 300 B. C. by someone belonging to the Megarian school of philosophy, but who had previously been a pupil of Theophrastus, such a person as Metrodorus or Timagoras (Diog. Laert. 2, 113). He maintains that the treatise considerably distorts the thought of Xenophanes - what we are given is in fact a Megarian Xeno</page><page sequence="2">128 G. B. Kerferd: Senofane ed. Untersteiner phanes. In consequence the account of Xenophanes can be used to extend our understanding of Megarian doctrine. None the less when the Mega rian elements have been subtracted the treatise is also of value for its account of Xenophanes. In support of this thesis it is claimed firstly that there is nothing in MXG which could not be the work of a Megarian who had some contact with Peripatetic thought, and secondly that a detailed examination of the arguments in MXG shows that in fact they could only have been pro duced by someone from within the Megarian camp. Unfortunately the analyses offered are ingenious rather than convincing. Particularly is this so with the vital first step in - the identification of a specifically Megarian doctrine of ?(juh?ty]c in the account of Xenophanes in MXG. According to [Plut.] Strom. 4 = DK 21 A 32, a passage probably reproducing the account of Theophrastus, Xenophanes denied yzvzGi? and cp&amp;op? but spoke of to 7i?v as ?el 6(jlolov. According to MXG 977 a 15-23 Xenophanes denied the possibility of y?veai? for god either ?? b[io?o\j or ?? ?vou-oiou. This U. regards as substituting for the vision of to TOxv ?si ?jjlolov in A 32 a dialectical analysis of ?fxoiov rising to ?e? and the "9-eo? ?tSio?. In fact the two arguments are completely different and unrelated, the se cond being concerned not with the nature of god but the question of the origin of god in something other than god. We cannot relate the two by saying that we pass from one to the other by a process of dialectical analysis. Next U. claims that the argument in MXG is based on the doctrine in Diog. Laert. 2, 107 where we are told that the Me garians rejected arguments from analogy because they are necessarily inferences yJtoi ?? oyLoic?v y) ?? ?voijLOLcov and neither case is justified. But there is no question here of ysveai? and there is absolutely no relation to the argument in MXG. Further confusion is introduced with the translation of 977 a 18-19 TauT? y?p ar:avTa tq?? ye l'ao?? xal o[io?c?? uy7T:?pysiv Trpo? ?XXrjXa as cinfatti tutte le cose identiche lo sono per propriet? di egual valore e per essere reciprocamente simili' and the attempt to relate it to Ari stotle Soph. El. 167 a 16-18 y?vsTai S? toio?tov ?v o?? ?fio?ooc uiz?Lpxziv Ta avTixeiuxva which may very well refer to the Megarians. But the correct meaning of the sentence in MXG is rather that given in the Oxford translation of Aristotle 'For at any rate when similars are equal, all the same qualities inhere in each and in a similar way in their relations to one another5, and it has nothing to do with the passage cited from Soph. El. which is concerned with predication. We are left then with this situation: Xenophanes, in all probability spoke of to tt5cv as ?el o(jlolov, meaning by this that it was uniform and exempt from change. MXG denies y?veoi? for god and attempts to prove it by an argument which uses ?pioiov in quite a different sense which is itself not specifically Megarian. In addition to the supposed Megarian doctrine of ?[kh?ty)c U. finds the following Megarian features in MXG: 1. An ethical conception of god, strange to the Eleatics, but appropriate to the Megarians, 2. the Megarian restriction of potency to actuality mentioned in Ar. Met. 1046 b 29-32, 3. the attribution to Xenophanes of the doctrine that god is neither infinite nor limited (MXG 977 a 3), when according to Aristotle Xenopha nes had said nothing clear on this point (o?S?v 8ieaoL(pr?viGzv Met. 986 b 22). U. argues that this was because the assignment of any predicate to god was felt to contradict the ?[aoi?tt)c of the Megarians. 1. is based on the occurrence of ?eXTiaroc in MXG 977 a 25 and ?pioroc in A 31, in each case alongside xpaxiaTo?. This is described as a substitution of the Megarian god for that of Xenophanes. But why need it be Megarian? 2. is based on the phrase &lt;i&gt;eoo</page><page sequence="3">G. B. Kerferd: Senofane ed. Untersteiner 129 S?voqjuv and the use of racpuxsvoa in MXG 977 a 27 and 31. These are regarded as in volving the equation of S?vajjuc and ?v?pysia in god. But there is nothing to suggest that any such distinction was in the mind of the writer in either of the two cases. 3. is at best highly speculative. The statement in MXG is fairly certainly a mistake and there are many ways in which it could have arisen. It need not be in any way due to Megarian influence. And it may be said that if Megarian difficulties about predication are in operation at this point in MXG, it is strange that in the section dealing with Gorgias the emphatic denial of the possibility of predicating the verb cto be' of that which is does not commend itself to the author, see 979 b 2-3 with discussion in Phronesis 1, 1955, 12. From the discussion of MXG Untersteiner turns to the criticism of anthropomorphism found in Xenophanes. He suggests that this is partly logical in origin - what is born must die, the gods do not die, therefore they are not born. There is no yevzaic or cp&amp;op? in the case of deity but simply to tcocv isl 6[ioiov (A 32). Moreover the concept of the divine exclu des action contrary to &amp;?fju?, therefore whatever does not act in accordance with freyuc, cannot be divine. On the positive side he supposes that Xeno phanes was concerned to restore the ancient religion of Veda as against the Olympian religion which had come partly to replace it. When Xeno phanes says sx yaiYj? y?p 7r?vxa xal ei? yyjv tc?cvtoc zsksuzo? (B 27), he is speaking both as a physicist and a theologian. Tocia, it is true, is not a physical element, a gtql^siov, so that Aristotle is justified in claiming that none of the physiologists held that earth was an element. Rather for Xenophanes Tocia is rc?vTa and this is what Aristotle is referring to in De An. 405 b 8-10 when he says that no one has proposed earth as an element ttXtjv si' tic, oc?ttjv e?pr?xev ?x tcocvto?v slvai tcov gtoi^s?gov 7) ravTa. The proposition yaia sail Tr?vTcx (the accentuation is that of Untersteiner) is regarded as a fundamental proposition for Xenophanes. For him there was simply one primary unity with many manifestations. This primary unity is variously described as 'mana5 and as a cfluido energ?tico5. In fact Untersteiner holds we can make a sort of rough equation for Xeno phanes according to which "Aiusipov, Chaos, O?rjic, Ta?a and ?[xoi?ty)c are all the same thing. The one primary unity passes from one manifestation to another in accordance with its own essential nature. The perception of this constitutes a great triumph for the human spirit and it was the achievement of Xenophanes that he was the first to gain this vision. It must be admitted that there is much that is attractive in this recon struction, notwithstanding the perilously Hegelian terminology in which it is expressed. What we have is an elaborate tidying-up operation - everything is brought into the argument and explained, everything is re lated to the supposed underlying unity in Xenophanes5 thought. The dis covery of such a unity must necessarily be the hope of every investigator, and one is therefore predisposed to sympathy for every such attempt. But there are grave difficulties which must arise in the mind of the reader as the author sweeps on from one ingenious identification to another. We are not told by anyone in antiquity that Xenophanes identified earth with his one divine principle, and the scanty fragments suggest that the two were regarded by him as distinct. God is ?9-s?c, and is never specified as a goddess as in the poem of 9 Gnomon 1957</page><page sequence="4">13o G. B. Kerferd: Senofane ed. Untersteiner Parmenides. The use of ^?yicrro? in s?? #?0?, sv ts 8-eo?ai. xal av&amp;pcimoiai [x?yia-roc (B 23) suggests, though of course it does not prove, that Xenophanes had in mind a power ful male ruler like Zeus, though admittedly not in human form. In fact to Clement the god of Xenophanes is ?ac?jxocToc (B 23). While this can hardly be correct for Xeno phanes in the sense of ^mmateriaP there is every reason to suppose that it is correct in the sense of 'having no body' and this is not really appropriate for Tata. Earth in the fragments seems always to be spoken of in physical terms as in B 27, 28, 29. 31 and 33. In particular Earth is described as having roots in B 28 and this seems quite unsuitable for Xenophanes' ev which is aei 6\ioiov. It is true that Untersteiner is aware of this, but he is driven for expla nation to a continuous appeal to the principle of dialectic. This gives a somewhat Protean character to his argument. A hypothesis has been put forward to explain the whole of Xenophanes' thought. We turn to the evidence and details emerge which seem to conflict with the hypothesis and to point away from any unified vision in Xenophanes. This is the evi dence which has led previous scholars to posit a development through successive stages whether from science to theology or from theology to science, or a fundamental and unresolved dualism in his thought about religion and physics, or simply a failure to think very far about the pro blems implicit in what he was saying. Now we are invited to see this same evidence change its shape as we hold it in our hands, and to find in it examples of the way in which Xenophanes transcended qualitative differentiations without abolishing them. What is lacking is any evidence that Xenophanes in fact thought of things in this way. It is far more likely that while consciously searching for unity he failed to realise the problems which such unity was bound to raise if found. Of particular interest is the discussion of De An. 405 b 8-10. This U. takes as refer ring to the doctrine of Xenophanes, ?x yaivj?.7r?vTa xa? zl? y^v Tr?vTa (B 27). This involves taking the ocuTiqv as referring to yr?. The doctrine to which Aristotle would then be referring would be one according to which earth was either composed out of a mixture of all the elements or else is itself all the elements. Such an interpretation of the oa&gt;TY)v is far superior to the interpretation of R. D. Hicks in his edition of the De Anima, who takes ocUttjv as referring to the soul. But this does not mean that it refers to Xenophanes. It is more probable that it refers to Empedocles as Hicks supposed, citing the quotation from Empedocles in De An. 404 b 13. If the above criticisms have any substance we can hardly accept as it stands the general interpretation of Xenophanes which U. presents. Yet something of value emerges. Jaeger wrote of Xenophanes ?the whole theological Eleatic Xenophanes is a chimaera. He is purely synthetic, the product of a doxographical attempt to build up a set of teacher-pupil relationships? (The Theology of the Early Greek Philisophers, Oxford, 1947, 54). This is fairly certainly a justified criticism of the development of the doxographic tradition. But from another point of view it is altogether too extreme. It makes it impossible to explain why Plato traced the be ginnings of Eleaticism back to Xenophanes and even earlier, and how the author of MXG could write about Xenophanes5 doctrine of god in the way in which he did. The answer must be that there was much in Xenophanes which did have affinities with Eleatic doctrine. The question,</page><page sequence="5">F. Solmsen: Aristotle Meteorol?gica ed. Lee 131 Was Xenophanes a philosopher or not ? is a modern question wrhich has no proper answer when it is applied to an early thinker like Xenophanes. Untersteiner's account of Xenophanes5 theology has the merit of making it easier to understand how Plato, and possibly others before him for we do not know that he was the first to do so, could see a continuous line of development from before Xenophanes to Parmenides and subsequent Eleatics. It remains to mention a few details. The text in general follows that of Diels-Kranz, but the apparatus criticus is not reproduced. U. begins the text of A 30 at an earlier point however, and from time to time elsewhere prefers a different reading. In the case of MXG he defends the manu script readings at 978 a 27 and, with a small change, at a 34. At other points he prefers to follow Apelt as against Diels, but these are isolated cases. The only wholly new suggestion I have found in the case of the fragments is sa&amp;X5 It?icov at B 1, 19 which perhaps gives rather too weak a sense to be altogether satisfactory. In view of all that has been written about the meaning of cp?mc it is a little surprising to be told without more ado about ?Tidea d'immobilit? inerente al concetto di cpuai? ? (CLXXIX).
