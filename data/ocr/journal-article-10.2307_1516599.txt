<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH BY ROLF KNIERIM Claremont, Cal. It is a matter of course that everything which we can discover regarding Isaiah's experience of vocation is based upon the report given by Isaiah himself in ch. vi 1-11 of the Book of Isaiah 1). This is important, not only because of the method of historical research, but especially because of the question of what function and intention Isaiah's self report (Selbstbericht) has with regard to his message 2). In this method dealing with the text of Isa. vi we are not primarily concerned with the question of what happened-as the historicity of Isaiah's experience is no longer a matter of great discussion-but, we need to understand the purpose of Isaiah's report 3). This approach 1) I am unable to follow C. F. WHITLEY'S conclusions in: "The Call and Mission of Isaiah", JNES 18, 1959, 38-48. According to WHITLEY, syntactical, word statistical, and historical (V. llf.) comparisons are to prove that Isa vi cannot be written by Isaiah himself, but it must stem from a post-exilic writer. But, at first, the construction of the two introductory clauses (V. 1) can very well be correct. (Comp. e.g., D. MICHEL, Tempora und Satzstellung in den Psalmen, Abh. z. Ev. Theologie, 1/1960, esp. p. 39ff). Beyond this, even if they were not correct an incorrect syntactical construction is no proof for or against someones author- ship. Secondly, the observation that several terms occur only in later traditions, does not compel us at all to assume that Isa vi is written by a later writer.This argumentation overlooks the possibilities that some expressions in Isa vi may begin with Isaiah or that they may have existed in an oral pre-stage, for example in the cultic traditions. Finally, WHITLEY does not mention those parts in Isa vi which undoubtedly go back to traditions older than Isaiah (see below). 2) This has been recognized in recent research by several investigations. Cp. E. JENNI, "Jesajas Berufung in der neueren Forschung", ThZ 15, 1959, pp. 321ff. 3) This question is different from the autobiographical one which, for example, is treated in the article written by J. P. LOVE, "The Call of Isaiah", Interp. XI, 1957, 282ff. LOVE also sees, that "the sixth chapter of Isaiah was not composed in a vacuum.... What Isaiah was as a man, what he became as a prophet, what he proclaimed as a message, all are woven into the texture of this vision call" (p. 282) and that "the story of the call as it has come down to us, is the product of much reflection" (p. 291). But when evaluating the problems, Dr. LOVE does not ask for the "Sitz im Leben" and the intentions, for the historical context of this report in the whole of Isaiah's prophetic existence, but he asks for the historical context of his (Isaiah's) experience. Our concern is, over-against this, to investigate Isaiah's self-report in the light of his prophetic existence. Also</page><page sequence="2">R. KNIERIM includes several types of questions. One of them is traditio-historical. For, when we recognize the traditional character of the report we are in a better position to understand its function. On the other hand, the question of its function in itself shows that the report must be related to the stage of Isaiah's present prophetic existence. That means that it is not enough merely to investigate its traditional forms. One must also investigate the statements of the report themselves, i.e. Isaiah's statements about the characteristics of his experience. But finally, the report can help us discover something about the relationship between Isaiah's experience, standing behind it, and his prophecy. Whether or not such a connection exists between Isaiah's experience and his prophecy can only be discovered by a comparison of the contents of both. Thus the approach has to be at least threefold. We must examine the traditions, the statements themselves, and finally the context of Isaiah vi. There is still another reason for thus combining several methods of investigation. This is the attempt to clarify the question of the uniqueness of the OT prophets. The opinion was held for a long time that the prophets were the great innovators, the real founders of the official religion of Israel. However, new research during the last generation has shown that this is not true, but that the prophets were dependent on many ancient traditions of Israel to a great extent. But at this point, the question arises again: Who were the prophets? Were they representatives, messengers, rejuvenators of the old traditions? Indeed they were! But does their uniqueness consist in this fact ? This question must be posed if the question of the uniqueness of the prophets is to be researched. Therefore we must make inquiries regarding the relations between the old and the new in the prophets. And we must turn to the question of the special motives for their appearance. The following considerations shall deal with this problem on the basis of Isa. vi. I. As is well known, there is a close relationship between the pattern LINDBLOM, Prophecy in Ancient Israel, 1962, 127ff. and 186ff., is mainly concerned with the interpretation of Isaiah's ecstatic experience rather than with the inter- pretation of Isaiah's report about his experience.Compare, however, G. VON RADs differentiation of this problem in Theol. II4, 1965, 62f.: "In der Berufung selbst wurde dem Propheten sein Auftrag iibermittelt; die Niederschrift dagegen geschah im Hinblick auf eine gewisse Offentlichkeit, der gegeniiber der Prophet sich zu rechtfertigen hatte". 48</page><page sequence="3">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH of the report and older, already existing traditions. A good deal of this investigation has been carried on concerning both the single elements of this chapter and the chapter in its totality (cp. LINDBLOM, MOWINCKEL, MORGENSTERN, MAY, ENGNELL, ALT, ZIMMERLI, and JENNI, to mention only a few.). Therefore I will confine myself to a short report dealing with only those aspects which still need more clarification. 1. The notation of the date, "In the year that King Uzziah died" (V. la), goes back to a practice attested to in contract documents. It states the "official" date of the year and it has the function of certifying the report 1). But one should ask whether or not this is the only possible explanation of the notation of the date. A look at the usage of such notations of dates in the prophetic literature shows that these notations are useful, not so much in certifying auto- biographical information about a visionary experience as in providing a theological statement that Yahwe has acted in that time 2). This might also be true with regard to the passages where the notation refers to the year of a king's death. During ancient times, the year of the death of a king was not only an official date recognized by everyone: the recognition went deeper, because the death of a king meant a deep caesura in history. It meant to a great extent the end of an epoch and the expectation of something new and uncertain. Thus it might be asked whether the notation of the date might not refer more to the vision itself rather than to the report, as it has been supposed. In this case, the notation would direct the reader's attention to what Yahwe had begun to create, in the year in which the epoch of Uzziah ended. It would then mean that the future events do not depend on Uzziah's successor to David's throne, but on Yahwe's initiative, which began with the call of Isaiah. Also, Isa xiv 28ff seems to imply this understanding, where Yahwe's aims are proclaimed to the Philistines, who are rejoicing over the death of Ahaz. Thus, although we have undoubtedly the tradition of the practice of contract documents, we must again inquire about the function of this form in the special context at the time. In our case, we have to ask whether the traditional form will certify the report about Isaiah's experience or if it is a means of stating Yahwe's initiative in that year. In the first case, its function could be to certify the biographical statement. 1) Cp. JENNI, p. 329. 2) Cp. Isa vii 8; xvi 14; xx 1, 3; xxi 16; xxix 1; xxxii 10; Am. i 1; ii 10; Zech. i 1, 7, 12; vii 1, 3, 5; Jer. i 2f; Ez. i If. Vetus Testamentum XVIII 4 49</page><page sequence="4">R. KNIERIM In the second case it would be a part of Isaiah's message. The year of the death of Uzziah is not yet exactly known. It may have been between 748 and 735/341). 2. The sentence, "I saw the Lord", cannot be understood without taking cognizance of the history of what it means in the OT "to see God". It has always been impossible, or of deadly consequence, to see God. One remembers the old Yahwistic tradition in Ex. xxxiii 20 where God says to Moses, "you cannot see my face; for man shall not see me and live". On the other hand, the sentence of Isaiah embodies an oral tradition, as shown by the word of Micaiah ben Imlah in I Kings xxii 19 "I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him, on his right hand and on his left". One remembers that it was said of the representatives of Israel: "they beheld God, and ate and drank" (Ex. xxiv lid). One may think of Jacob: "I have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved" (Gen. xxxii 30d). The matter is similar with Gideon and Manoah. The latter says: "We shall surely die, for we have seen God". (Jd. xiii 22) Thus Isaiah's sentence is grounded in the tradition where only a very few in Israel are allowed to see God. Although Isaiah speaks of having seen only a portion of Yahwe, he says this sentence and expresses by it the fact that he himself belongs to the exclusive circle of men who can say-"I have seen God, and I live" 2). 3. Also conditioned by the tradition, but not yet entirely explained, is the statement, "... sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up". (lb. The idea of the throne of Yahwe is old and has been often used) According to the passages, the throne is either in heaven 3) or in the temple of Jerusalem4).

But there are some differences in the relationship between Isa vi 1-4 and 1 Ki. xxii 19ff in this respect: 1 Ki. xxii 19 speaks expressly of trntn N=: bz whereas Isa vi speaks only of Q,n5it 1). 1 Ki. xxii really deals with the heavenly council, which enters the dialogue after Yahwe's question. But the seraphim of Isa vi do not counsel, they serve. One might ask why neither tartw nor rs: '3 is mentioned in Isa vi. Thus the parallel between Isa vi and 1 Ki. xxii can scarcely prove the identity of the place, since in principle either heaven or earth could be taken as the place. On the other hand there are some strong arguments in favor of the temple which cannot be overlooked: according to the tradition, Yahwe is continuously present in the Debir. This presence was originally understood as his sitting upon the ark 2). This idea was also connected in early times with the idea of Yahwe sitting upon the throne, whereby there is no identity between the ark and the throne, as will be pointed out below. Whether or not the throne is seen in heaven or in the temple can only be shown by the special character of Isaiah's whole vision, because both are possible, as the above passages show. But here some arguments may be brought forth in favor of the temple. Budde has already argued that the train could fill only the temple on earth. But more important is the fact that the term nian (V. 4), obviously meaning the same as ',nf in V. 1, always refers to the temple on earth if it is used for the temple 3). Another piece of confirmatory evidence is the fact that the word ro (= "threshold") is used only with regard to the temple on earth. Furthermore, the altar (V. 6) belongs to this temple. And finally, DE VAUX refers rightly to the smoke in the temple of Jerusalem on the day of consecration (1 Ki. viii 10f) 4). Thus, in my opinion, Isaiah had his vision in the temple of Jerusalem. But it is probably not even necessary to state an alternative! in Ancient Israel, 1962, p. 128), and VRIEZEN, "Essentials of the Theology of Isaiah" in: Israel's Prophetic Heritage, 1962, p. 130. 1) Similar, V.

KNIERIM For it is well known that Jerusalem, in connection with Canaanite mythological ideas, was regarded as the city of God 1). This idea seems to be especially predominant in Isaiah's prophecy: cp. ii 2-4; vii 1-9; viii 18; xiv 32; xvii 10; xxviii 16; xxx 29; xxxi 5, 9. According to this idea the temple on Mount Zion is the place on earth where Yahwe rests his foot. It still belongs to the heavenly space, and Yahwe can be regarded experienced as sitting upon his throne in heaven as well as in the temple. The special aspect would thus depend on the special situation presupposed in the context. However, in Isa vi we would have a heavenly vision in the temple on earth 2). But also the idea of the tradition of the throne is still to be discussed. The idea is old and has often been expressed that Yahwe has a throne 1Ot. And, as was mentioned above, the throne stands either in heaven or in the temple at Jerusalem. Thus with regard to the time of Isaiah, both ideas are possible. But it is another question whether or not this was true also in earlier times. And we must also inquire about the 1) Cp. the references given by H. SCHMID, ZAW 67, 1955, pp. 180f, 188, and by W. SCHMIDT, Konigtum Gottes in Ugarit und in Israel, BZAW 80, 1961, pp. 23ff. The main OT passages are Ex. xv 17; Pss. xi 4; xli 5a; xliii 2-4; lxviii 34ff; lxxx 2f; lxxxvii 5b; xciii 2-5; xcix 5; cxxxii 7; cxlviii If; Isa ii 2-4; xiv 12ff: lx 1; lxvi 1; Lam. ii 1. 2) This has been supposed already in earlier scholarship, cp. e.g. H. BUDDE, Jesajas Erleben, p. 7; 0. PROCKSCH, Theologie des AT, p. 189; R. HENTZSCHKE, Die Stellung der vorexilischen Propheten umn Kult, p. 57, with reference to Martin SCHMIDT, Prophet und Tempel, 1948. A. WEISER, Festschrift Bertholet, 1950, p. 520; M. BUBER, Der Glaube der Propheten, 1950, p. 182. A point of discussion might be HENTZSCHKE'S statement, "dass die Berufungsvision eine ausserordentliche Erscheinung beschreibt, die keine Verwandschaft mit der iiblischen Vorstellung vom Wohnen Gottes in seinem Heiligtum aufweist. Im Gegenteil, der irdische Tempel kann Jahwe gerade nicht fassen". It is certainly "eine ausserordentliche Erscheinung". But HENTZSCHKE'S statement seems to presuppose a competition or opposition between the idea of God's dwelling in the temple and his coming into the temple. This is improbable. In order to clarify this question an investiga- tion and definition of the relationship between the so-called "Prasenztheologie" and "Erscheinungstheologie" would be necessary. Cp. e.g. Ps. lxxx 2, 3 and H. J. KRAUS, Gottesdienst in Israel, 1962, p. 250. Some preliminary investigations which have been performed can not dispense with this question, e.g., those of R. RENDTORFF, "Die Offenbarungsvorstellungen im AT", in Offenbarung und Geschichte, KuD, Beihaft 1, 1961. W. ZIMMERLI, "Offenbarung im AT", EvTh. 22, 1962, pp. 15-30. R.

Recently, also MAIER, (ibid.) emphasizes this aspect when saying, "Der Thronende sprengt den Raum (p. 109) and when speaking of the "mythischen Einheit von 'oben' und 'unten'..... wie zur Zeit Jesajas fur die Tempelideologie sicher noch vorauszusetzen ist" (p. 19f.) The earthly temple is in each case included. 52</page><page sequence="7">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH relationship between the throne, the ark (1pq), and the cover (nnm ) 1). Now the original idea of the throne of Yahwe can hardly be brought together with the idea of the ark or of the cover of the ark, as has often been done 2). According to the OT proofs, the idea of the "throne" belongs to the idea of the king 3). The throne is basically a symbol of the power of the king 4). This is not different with regard to the "throne of Yahwe Sabaoth" in Isa vi 2, 5. Thus also in Isa vi, we are primarily concerned with the royal throne and the revelation of Yahwe the king. Furthermore, the word gt0 is always connected with the simple idea of a chair, an armchair, the seat of a representative, but never-except the late passage Ezek. x lff-with the terms nm P, 7 mN, r, :a,nw ;n.This distinction is not simply a linguistic one. For on the one hand the idea of the v,:n~ is early connected with the idea of nrm and this, again, is connected with the idea of Yahwe's expedition, "nins n1ir". On the other hand, the ark is mostly the footstool 5) of the throne (tnrn Isa lxvi 1; Pss. xcix 5; cxxxii 7), but not the throne itself. This matter causes us to look for another origin for the idea of the throne. As mentioned above, and as Isaiah himself indicates (V. 5c), it belongs to the idea of Yahwe as king, and yet as the king of heaven, with the heavenly council and the host of heaven (1 Ki. xxii 19; Isa vi 2; Pss. lxxxix 6-8; lxxxii Iff; et al.) It was probably taken over from the Canaanite myth shortly after the settlement 6). But now even the idea of the throne of Yahwe depends on this myth of Baal. In the Baal and Anat cycle there occurs the same root "kussu" including the numerous occurrences of the throne of God as the sign of his power. Also mentioned is the footstool and twice the titanic size and splendor of the throne of Baal, which has a back and which is an armchair. It is remarkable in this connection that the expression, "high and lifted up" (Isa vi 2), occurs only once, Isal vii 15, an appellativum for the ruler sitting in the heights. All 1) The evaluation of the traditio-historical facts in ThWBNT3, Op6vo0, by O. SCHMITZ, is hardly sufficient. 2) Cp. A. WEISER, Festschrift Bertholet, 1950, p. 520. 3) Cp. Gen. xli 40; Ex. xi 15; xii 29; 2 Sam. vii 12ff; xiv 9; 1 Ki. iv 13, 35, 46; ii 12, 19, 24, 33, 45; xvi 11; Jer. xiii 13; et al. 4) The word Ron = "throne, chair", occurs several times in Phoenician inscriptions, each time referring to the throne of a king, and in new-Phoenician inscriptions referring to the throne of the statue of the divine Augustus. cp. H. DONNER- W. R6LLIG, Kanaandische und Aramdische Inschriften, 1964, III, 12. 5) Thus, if K6HLER, Lex., is right. But even this connection is to be doubted with regard to Lam. ii 1. 6) Cp. A. ALT, Gedanken fiber das Konigtim Yahwes, KS I pp. 345ff. W. SCHMIDT, ,,Jerusalemer El-Traditionen bei Jesaja", ZRelGg xvi, 4, 1964, 302-314. 53</page><page sequence="8">R. KNIERIM these facts make it evident, in my opinion, that the idea of the throne of Yahwe in Isaiah vi belongs to the conception of Yahwe as king of heaven, and that Israel appropriated this conception from the Canaanites, possibly from the specific Jebusite traditions of Jerusalem. Therefore, the throne of God belonged originally in heaven, the ark on earth or in the temple on earth 1). We stand, consequently, before the complicated traditio-historical situation that Isaiah receives a vision of an originally heavenly scene in the temple of Jerusalem. This vision stands, as can be proved by many elements and as has been shown especially by MOWINCKEL and WEISER, in the tradition of theophanies in the temple. But I do not think that Isaiah's vision took place during a cultic festival, as ENGNELL (The Call of Isaiah, 1949), W. VISCHER 2) and others have supposed 3). The vision of Micaiah shows that the matter is a unique experience. This is true also for Isaiah. The difference between the generally well known tradition and Isaiah's experience is that Isaiah experiences exclusively and personally what normally belongs to the cultic theophany for all the people. But in connection with this, another question must still be con- sidered. For almost all the traditions of Yahwe as a king sitting or appearing upon his throne represent not simply formal pre-stages of our passage. They also contain a certain type of content. Already in the Baal-myth, the idea of the throne is an expression of the god's function of judgment, which belongs to his power4). This is, by now, true also for Yahwe to a very great extent. For what purpose does the King Yahwe appear upon his throne, does he take place upon it, does he gather his council, and that-as with Isaiah-not at a periodical date of the cultic festivals? We consequently turn from the question of the place of Isaiah's vision to the question of the function of Yahwe's appearance to Isaiah! And here again, the OT tradition cannot be overlooked. According to passages like Pss. xlv 7f; cxxii 4; xcvii 1-9; xi 4-7; xcviii 9; lxxxii 8; xcv 18f; xii; xviii 7 1; lxxvi; Am. i 2ff; 1 Ki. xxii 19; Dan. vii 9f; Mal. iii 1-5, there is a very broad tradition about Yahwe's appearance in judgment. 1) Also, L. ROST, "K6nigsherrschaft Yahwes in vork6niglicher Zeit?", ThLZ 85, 1960, p. 724, and J. MAIER, Das altisraelitische Ladeheiligtum, BZAW 93, 1965, p. 66, have recently rejected the identification of ark and throne. 2) Die Immanuelbotschaft im Rahman des Ksniglichen Zionstestes, 1955. 3) Cp.

SCHMIDT. 54</page><page sequence="9">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH This tradition has many terminological and topical contacts to the vision of Isaiah vi. One of the closest ones should be Amos ix 1. And as to 1 Ki. xxii 19, it seems to be important that the purpose of Micaiah's vision is to make him participate in the council of judgment and to inform him about the judgment. The vision is not only the formal frame of his experience, but in it Micaiah recognizes the decision of judgment. At the same time, it is his task to proclaim what he has seen. As far as I could observe, A. WEISER 1) has been the only one who has drawn the adequate consequences from this traditio- historical fact by saying that Isaiah had a vision of judgment. But this would mean that the vision itself reveals immediately that Yahwe sits within a council of judgment and that he is beginning to judge. The function of the vision would be from the beginning- parallel to the theophanies-to reveal this fact. From the recognition of this type of vision some points of Isaiah's report appear in a new light. 4. Before drawing a conclusion to this part, I should mention that almost all the other parts of the report are founded in older traditions too, as is known in the main. Thus the name "Yahwe Sabaoth" (V. 3 + 5) is known in Israel as the official cultic name of the god Yahwe who is on Zion 2). Isaiah also knows that Yahwe Sabaoth is called "holy" 3). He uses the usual appellative "the holy One of Israel", as nobody else 4). The trisagion indeed is stated only here in this form (if one leaves out Ps. ic 3, 5, 9 5). Finally, the sentence rTn= r ip;n z 'tt in the translation, "the fullness of all the earth is his glory", is found in the cultic pattern, too. (Pss. xxiv 1; 1 1) 6). This doxology meditates a qualified judgment of the earth that is not a tabula rasa, but the extension of the power of Yahwe Sabaoth from Zion in the fullness of nature and mankind. It is clear that the doxology in V. 3b contains the Temple-Zion theology in a con- centrated form, to a great part-and that it is the result of a long 1) Festschrift Bertholet, 1950, p. 525. 2) Cp.

KNIERIM used tradition which was developed after Isaiah and grounded in his formulation too. This doxology seems to stand in traditio-historical connection with the vision. If Isaiah experiences a vision of judgment, one must ask if he isn't also hearing the doxology of judgment. This type of doxology of judgment is a known tradition. It confesses to and glorifies the power of Yahwe in creature and mankind before the majesty of God, when he appears to judge sin 1). A number of passages-not the least of which is the mention of the horrible figures of the seraphim according to Isa. xiv 29; xxx 6 and of the shaking of the framework of the temple under their thunderous call-make probable this understanding of Isa vi 3 2). Also the confession of the sins of Isaiah must be understood on the basis of this tradition of the doxology of judgment. For a syn- tactical and a traditio-historical analysis of the sentence in V. 5: -"Woe is me, for I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts"-shows that it contains an accumula- tion of statements modifying the "Woe" cry. This double motivation of "Woe is me; for I am lost" is not necessary. The motivation "for I have seen the Lord" is-according to the tradition-completely sufficient. But why is a confession of sins added? 3) This must have a reason. And this obviously depends on the character of the vision as a vision of judgment. For it is traditional to confess sins in the presence of Yahwe's judgment. Thus we have two doxologies of judgment, the doxology of the seraphim and the doxology of Isaiah. Thereby the difference in the formulations is based on the different situations of those who are confessing. Even the double confession for himself and for his people can be explained by this presupposition. If Isaiah experiences the revelation of judgment on his whole people- 1) Cp. Pss. xvi 56-60; xxix 1-9; lxxxix 7-15; cxviii 17-21; 1 Sam. vi 5; Josh. vii 19; Jer. xiii 15f; Am. iv 13; v 8; ix 5; Mic. i 1; 2) LINDBLOM does not see any independent function of the theophany within the report, when saying, "Three elements are of special significance: 1) the purific- ation of the prophet's lips, 2) the commission, 3) the content of the message to be proclaimed". (op. cit. p. 186) 3) LINDBLOM, op. cit., p. 186, finds it "somewhat curious that on being confronted with the holiness of God, Isaiah became aware that he and the whole nation had unclean lips.... believe that when the vision was subsequently recorded the picture was somewhat obscured by the fusion of two elements: the general act of the forgiveness of Isaiah's sin, and the special act of purifying his lips. This latter motif belongs in a special way to the call". But, the question remains, why does the confession of sins and of their forgiveness happen? 56</page><page sequence="11">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH according to the tradition of theophany-then he must as the re- presentative of the people, confess both his own and his people's sin. Last but not least, we remember that also the other subjects,- such as the burning coal, the tongs, the altar, the action of the purifica- tion of his lips 1), and the statement of forgiveness-are elements of the traditional cult; even if the statement, "Your guilt is taken away, and your sin forgiven", is unique and if it, in this form, cannot be taken as a traditional formulation. II After the traditio-historical investigation has already given im- portant information about the character of Isaiah's self-report, we can now try to clarify our question further by investigating the report by form historical methods, inquiring into the pattern (form), the type, the intention, and finally the historical question. But prior to this we will turn once more to the question of the character of Isaiah's vision. 1. With regard to this, it is first necessary to make a distinction between a vision of vocation and a vision of judgment. For we must realize that the firm structure of a prophetic report of a vision as seen in its immediate prototype, 1 Ki. xxii 19ff, has nothing to do with a vision of a prophetic vocation. For when Micaiah received the vision, he was already a prophet and well known as a prophet. He saw the heavenly council and heard the decision of judgment. Thus he has a vision of judgment. This structure can hardly have been lost or entirely dissolved into the vision of call in Isaiah vi, as the traditio-historical results have shown. This is confirmed by the fact that according to the form of the direct vocation, God addresses the concerned directly (cp. Moses, Amos, Jeremiah, etc.). But this is not found here 2). Yahwe's question to the heavenly 1) Cp. the Accadian and Egyptian rites of mouth purification, mentioned already by DUHM, then by ENGNELL and BENTZEN and finally by LINDBLOM, Prophecy, p. 186. But the above analysis has pointed out that the purification of Isaiah's lips is not only related to the following events, but also to the foregoing confession of sins. Each element of the process has its function necessary for the whole experience. About the traditional character of vv. 5-7, cp. J. BARR, op. cit., p. 36. 2) LINDBLOM, op. cit., p. 186, does not differentiate between these viewpoints when saying, "It is to be observed that Isaiah did not resist the call but, unlike Jeremiah, obeyed willingly", and when explaining Isaiah's "obedience" with "the different personalities of the prophets" that "are revealed in the manner in which they received their call as well as in their preaching". This overlooks the 57</page><page sequence="12">R. KNIERIM council: "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us" (parallel 1 Ki. xxii 20) has its place originally not in the vocation of a prophet but in the heavenly council, from whose membership must be sought a messenger to bring the decision of judgment 1). Jeremiah xxiii 18 is still very much aware of this original place when he says: "For who among them has stood in the council of the Lord, to perceive and to hear his word, or who has given heed to his word and listened ?" 2) According to this, Isaiah experiences in the first place a theophanic vision of the heavenly council probably shortly after the decision of judgment was made regarding the people. There are several grounds for implying that the decision of judgment has been made in the heavenly council shortly before Isaiah received the theophany: Cooke already supposed the heavenly council to be present because of the mentioning of "the host". But also Yahwe's question (V. 8) presupposes that the content of the order for the messenger is already stated. This content of hardening the people (V. 9f) might have its proto- type also in 1 Ki. xxii 20, "Who will entice Ahab?" The verb ;1rE. (1 Ki. xxii 20) and the verbs ' rW;l, :l;l, and St7l, used in Isa vi 10, seem to express the same kind of acting, which psychologically can be-and is- explained in different ways. Thus the mention of the content of the order occurs at different places within both narrations. And, this may have its reason, especially with regard to Isaiah vi. But also the proclamation of the content itself by Yahwe indicates that it is not just created but that it was prepared and ready for proclamation. Even the "sitting" of Yahwe may belong to this situation of the throne-council, for this expression would depend on the special situation and be not only an ontological statement about Yahwe. Also the doxologies of the seraphim and of Isaiah seem to be the reaction to the decision of judgment made im- mediately before 3). And also the moment of Yahwe's appearance does not seem to have been chosen at random. Yahwe appears to Isaiah in the moment after the basic decision is made regarding the history of Israel fact that Isaiah's concern was not at all to reveal something about his personality with this kind of report. (see below). 1) G. COOKE, "The Sons of (the) God(s)", ZAW, 76, 1964, pp. 22ff., says on p. 38: "the inclusion of the seraphim in the heavenly assembly is problematical". But "the fact that the members of the court or council are not specifically mentioned should constitute no difficulty; the very theological concept need not always be pictured in full detail. If the articulate seraphim are not to be regarded as members of the heavenly council, the title "lord of hosts" may have been taken to imply the presence of Yahwe's heavenly host on this occasion". As hypothetical as this implication is, it is unavoidable, as will be shown below. In either case, we have no reason not to take Yahwe's question as a question to the council. 2) Cp. also COOKE, p. 39. 3) COOKE, p. 32: "the attendants upon the throne accompanied the divine presence more or less continuously". But it should be asked whether perhaps they are praising Yahwe for something which had just taken place. 58</page><page sequence="13">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH in the year that King Uzziah died. All that remains is to find the messenger. Thus Isaiah does not really participate in the heavenly council and surely not in the decision of judgment. He only participates in that part in which a messenger is sought. This form of report makes it clear that he has nothing to do with the decision of judgment itself, but that on the other hand he could not escape the task of becoming the messenger. Thus, already with regard to VV. 1-4, Isaiah knows that the action of judgment has already begun against the people. One may say that he knows, even if he had had no vocation himself. This part of his experience (VV. 1-4) is important in itself and is not only to be understood with reference to the call. Therefore, this first part of the report already contains the basic statement of the whole report. Whereas, the report of the vocation has only a special function within it. It follows it. But this is true also. For Isaiah is not only informed, like Micaiah, but also personally involved in the final action of the council. This is already implied in the fact that the theophany takes place in the temple and that it is normally manifested to the people concerned. Isaiah is originally a member of the unclean people. But this time the theophany appears especially to him. Therefore, he has to confess his own sins first and then to include a confession of the sins of the people. Then quite surprisingly there follows his own purification, separating him from the people. For them judgment will come. By virtue of his purification Isaiah is able to be present at the council and to hear what is said. Thus he hears, like Micaiah, that Yahweh needs a messenger in order to initiate His action. It is self-evident that Isaiah, having been purified and having realized that his people are to be judged, declares himself ready. Nobody else has this obligation. At this point the progress of Isaiah's vision over that of Micaiah is evident. Instead of "the spirit" coming forward as in 1 Kings xxii 21, Isaiah declares himself ready. With this, he enters the service of Yahwe's judgment. He becomes the preparer and first executor of the judgement. Thus the vision of judgment becomes a vision of call for Isaiah. This combination of two different Gattungen of the report of a vision has consequently its grounds in the subject matter itself; i.e., in the progress from the original vision of judgment to the vision of the call, which is of course the goal of the theophany. The order that Isaiah receives confirms the belief that what he has to do is an expression of the beginning of Yahwe's judgment, which was revealed to him in the theophany. And it confirms how his vocation is to be understood as a consequence of Yahwe's coming to judgment. 59</page><page sequence="14">R. KNIERIM In this Isaiah remains mainly passive. His participation in the dialogue (8-11) is minimal: "Here am I. Send me" and "How long, O Lord?" Regarding the purpose of his mission he does not need to ask, because it is self-evident after the vision of judgment. It is known 1) that the message which he has to present: "Hear, hear, but without insight! See, see, but without perception!" (9b) represents a powerful word. That word does not present a specific content, but rather has the power to effect what it expresses. The following verse (V. 10) confirms this; for this verse interprets V. 9: "Make the heart of this people hard, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed." We observe the structure of this commandment, the poetic form, which is to be a memorable and powerful word. We observe the basic statement of the goal at the end of the commandment. This commandment to make the people stubborn is different from a ritual word to a messenger. It is grounded in the idea that Yahwe is already accomplishing his work in the proclamation of his word. Isaiah asks, "How long, O Lord?" and Yahwe's answer finally shows the scope of the judgment (11): "Until lie waste cities without inhabitants houses without men the field desolated to desert." 2. It has already been stated that the early part of the report has a certain necessary function in the whole, and it has been explained what that function is. The result can be confirmed by a form analysis of the report. It is completely reflected and systematically formed. Especially the last part (8-11) is exactly subdivided and linguistically formed for the purpose of making the message impressive. A. Statement of time (la) B.

Thus the related elements become visible here too (e.g. I-III, VI-VIII). On the other hand, some distinctions appear: Isaiah's Reaction (IV), esp. as 3a-c shows, does not just introduce a second part (V. 5-7), but it is integrally related to, and grounded in I-III. Thus it belongs to these parts, whereas his purification (V) is not a matter of course at all. This part presupposes, indeed, Isaiah's confession, but the purification must not necessarily follow it. Thus the purification is something 61</page><page sequence="16">R. KNIERIM new and surprising. It represents an unexpected turn of Isaiah's experience toward himself. More clearly it shows that Isaiah himself is the goal of the theophany which he experiences. Therewith it introduces the following parts, VI-VIII, making clear that only he himself can be the man to declare his readiness (VII) after Yahwe's question (VI) 1). With regard to a division into larger units, one could, consequently, even divide the report into two parts (I-IV = V. lb-5 and V-VIII = V. 6-11). Yahwe's question (VI) and the mission (VIII) finally are related again to the first parts (I + II), as the inter- pretation of the character of the visions has shown Also the form- analysis makes clear that each part of the report is necessary to the whole. This leads to the observation that obviously not one or another part represents the aim and high point of the report, containing its main statement, but that the main statement is made by the report as a whole. What this means must be explained below. 3. We may now turn to the question of the Gattung and the inten- tion of the report. We have to prove, as JENNI has decisively stated, that the theological ideas of Isa vi cannot be exchanged for the kerygma of the report (p. 333); and we will define the report as a Denkschrift, written for the purpose of legitimating and justifying the prophetic message, especially the message of evil. The cause of such writing is obviously unbelief and opposition to the prophet and his message (p. 328ff). We can, consequently, say that the report represents a documentary aetiology of Isaiah's message of evil. Nevertheless, some questions are still open at this point. The first refers to the relationship between traditional theology and the special intention of the report. The question arises because the traditional theology used even in the stereotyped form which has been recognized cannot be an incidental element in this report. The choice of this form by Isaiah must have been intentional. And this intention might have been different from the necessity to justify his prophecy of evil. The justification could have been made by pointing to his vision and mission, but there are different kinds of visions and different kinds of vocations. Why did Isaiah choose a stereotyped traditional and theological form for such justification? What additional function did this form have within the justifying report? To pose the question we need to see the answer. Isaiah obviously tries to prove the authen- ticity, the legitimacy of his vision and mission. That is, he not only 1) At this point, the reason for my objection against LINDBLOM, p. 186 should become clear. 62</page><page sequence="17">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH justifies his prophecy of evil by the vision but he also confirms the legitimacy of his vision by the use of commonly known and acknowl- edged theological traditions. This is obviously caused by a special existential historical situation, in which a message could no longer be justified simply by a reference to a vision. A vision in itself was no longer a confirmation of the truth of a prophecy. There were also false visions, especially if the prophecy was evil. Thus it had to be proved that the vision had come from Yahwe, and the best way to do this was to narrate the vision and the mission within the traditional forms of prophetic visions and especially within the theological ideas of the cult of Jerusalem. Thus in this motivation of prophetic existence a highly interesting phenomenon can be observed. Isaiah uses the theological tradition extensively in order to justify his vision and the new message which proclaims the end of traditions. But in the first line Isaiah does not motivate his vision. His first intention is to justify his message by his personal vision and mission. The message which he had been proclaiming had its origin in this personal experience, and his concern was to testify to the immediate character of this experience. It is necessary to say this because the impression could arise that the report is mainly interested in pointing out the traditio-historical connections, whereas the historical question is not especially important. But the contrary is true, for Isaiah has not quietly out-grown his theological traditions to become a prophet, -nor his psychic predispositions. Hundreds of his contemporaries' for example the priests, knew the traditions as well as Isaiah and never became prophets. Isaiah became a prophet by the immediate visionary experience of God, although certainly it was the same God who was known by tradition. Without this vocation Isaiah would never have existed as a prophet, in spite of all traditions. This can even be seen from his own report in which the historical argumentation is essentially employed; for Isaiah motivates the necessity of his message by refer- ence to the experience in which he was specially elected from among the people (V. 5d). How can this motivation be valid if he did not have the experience and if he did not precisely intend his report to be historical? Thus the special goal of the report must consist precisely in the reference to the historicity of his experience. It is true that the pattern of the report contains-especially in the last part (VV. 9-11)-the experience of the history of Isaiah's message too. But in its essential parts, the experience must have happened as 63</page><page sequence="18">R. KNIERIM reported to us. At this point we touch upon the historical origin of Isaiah's prophetic existence. This historical origin is the ground which alone makes possible the justification of the message, and in this experience the prophetic independence, uniqueness and un- predictability become visible. And a last statement. We said that the main statement is made by the whole of the report and not only by a certain part of it. Indeed, it is clear that the process of the vision leads to Isaiah's personal involvement. But this does not mean that everything else is only preliminary. Although the command (VV. 9-11) is not the main point, it already presupposes Isaiah's message of evil and points to its origin. But also those origins must be very evasive and this evasion happens in the whole of the experience with all its elements. All of them have a special function and none can be lacking. The vision (I-III) motifies the real origin of the message of the Heavenly council of judgment. Isaiah's confession (IV) signifies that he can only agree with the judgment. The purification (V) reveals why he stands alone among the people. He has inevitably been chosen as messenger of Yahwe's words, and parts VI-VIII show why he and nobody else had to be ready, that this is the original command for his message, that command and message are identical, and that he had no influence upon it, as his participation precisely in this part proves. III But now we must take a final step and ask whether the contents of his vision were important for his prophecy too. As seen above the contents had a function for the legitimation of the vision. But if the vision happened within the framework of the traditional theology, we have to ask whether or not this reality became also important for Isaiah's prophecy as a whole. In other words, we have to ask how broad the theological background of Isaiah's kerygma is and to what degree it extends to his prophecy. This can only be done by a comparison of the theology of this report with the theology of Isaiah's prophecy, at least during its first period. We are inclined to suppose a connection from the fact that Isaiah's report was written at the end of his first prophetic period and that, therefore, the report can stand within those limits throughout. This is especially true if 64</page><page sequence="19">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH the report is meant to justify the message as such. To this question only some observations shall be noted 1). 1. According to common opinion Isaiah began his prophetic activity immediately after his vision, with the message of the "Day of Yahwe" (ii 6-21). This idea was already contained in the old traditions of the time when Yahwe set out to deliver his people 2). In the time of Isaiah the idea was known among the people, who looked forward to a day of judgment for their enemies and a day of salvation for Israel, as Am. v 18 shows: "Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord. Why would you have the day of the Lord? It is darkness and not light". With regard to the day, Isaiah does not introduce a new motif. But why does he start his prophecy by bringing back to life this tradition; and why is he, like Amos, arguing against the contemporary opinion of the character of the "Day" and announ- cing a day of judgment against Yahwe's people themselves (ii 6)? The reference to the tradition alone is not sufficient nor is the reference to the tradition of the judgment upon Israel in the periodical cult in the temple of Jerusalem or in special catastrophic events sufficient to explain the extraordinary prophetic message of the total destruction of the nation. But it is possible that Isaiah was reminded of his vision where he experienced the appearance of Yahwe "sitting upon a throne high and lifted up", and beginning to judge his people. It is possible that he was reminded of his task, to make the heart of the people fat, "until the cities lie waste...". And this new aspect of history began "in the year that King Uzziah died". In this connec- tion, the parallel elements of the majesty in Chapter ii and of the holiness and glory in Chapter vi can scarcely be overlooked. (Another parallel is Amos i 2; ix 2; cp. also Joel iii 16, Jer. xxv 30, showing that there were prophecies of judgment caused by an experience of a theophany of judgment in the temple of Jerusalem). Also words like "Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord speaks", (Isa i 2) or, "The Lord hath taken his place to contend. He stands to judge his people", (iii 13) seem to be motivated by the vision of 1) The connection has been recognized. Cp. Th. C. VRIEZEN, "Essentials of the Theology of Isaiah" in: Israel's Prophetic Heritage, 1962, pp. 128ff., esp. p. 131, and J. P. LOVE, op. cit., pp. 294ff. According to LOVE, the connection appears in the following topics: the Holy one of Israel, the emphasis upon faith, his assurance, depending on the inviolability of Mt. Zion, the universal sway-the king of all the earth, the message of the remnant. 2) Cp. G. VON RAD. Vetus Testamentum XVIII 5 65</page><page sequence="20">R. KNIERIM judgment; although Isaiah is not the first to use these forms of proclamation. 2. Also the question belongs here, why does Isaiah refer so vigorous- ly to the break-down of justice and righteousness (i 16f, 18-20, 21-26; v 7; x 1-4 et al.)? It is recognized that he actualizes with it the Torah practice of the temple cult in Jerusalem 1). 3. What about the commandment to "make stubborn" (VV. 9-11)? Some have said that the order has no content and felt this as a deficiency. But this alleged deficiency disappears if the contents of Isaiah's message were either freely available or already given in the vision of judgment. Then Isaiah would fulfill his order to make stubborn by unfolding the contents of that vision. 4. Isaiah has actualized to a great extent and in its purest form the old tradition of the Holy War, saying that Yahwe would ascend to Zion in a great expedition to protect it (vii 1-7; xxviii 16; xxix 1-8; xxx 15, 27-33). xxxi 4-5 says: "As a lion or a young lion growls over his prey..... so the Lord of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill". The reference to the old tradition is certainly an explanation for the question from whence Isaiah had his ideas. But if one asks how he came to actualize this old tradition, the reference to the tradition alone is not satisfying. Some have tried to rationalize these elements or to declare Isaiah as an enthusiast, but the answer seems to lie nearer than is commonly supposed. One has to ask whether Isaiah could have actualized these traditions without the experience of his vision. The answer should be clear. Isaiah would not have carefully actualized these long-forgotten traditions in such utopian realism as to demand the belief in the miracle of a theophany if he had not been completely convinced of the reality of the Lord descending from heaven to the temple. And this conviction was stimulated by his vision of judgment and by his vocation. Without the sentence, "My eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts", Isaiah could never have spoken in such a realistic way of the "alien work" of Yahwe and he could never have demanded belief without any other alternative. If we have seen this fact, then the connections within Chapter vi or between Chapter vi and Chapter vii 1-9, 10-17, can be understood once more in a special light 2). 1) Cp. v. RAD, Theologie. 2) Cp. Leon J. LIEBREICH, "The Position of Chapter Six in the Book of Isaiah", HUCA XXV, 1954, p. 37ff. LIEBREICH has good arguments in opting for the connection between chapter vi and viiff. when saying, in chapter vi God is for 66</page><page sequence="21">THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH 5. Similar statements could be made regarding the relation between some further elements of the theophany of Isa vi and the prophecy of Isaiah as a whole. Why did Isaiah so often use the appellative, "the Holy one of Israel"? One is referred to the trisagion (V. 3), "Holy, holy, holy", and to the multiplied weight of this expression. The same is true for the use of the name "Yahwe Sabaoth". 6. If we examine further the announcement of a natural catastrophe of nearly cosmic extent and the spaciousness in which Isaiah beholds the activity of God in history, the high spirituality of this prophet cannot be overlooked. However, in spite of this we must ask whether there does not exist a connection between the universal aspects and the word, "the fulness of all the earth is his glory" (V. 3). A passage like xxviii 22, "I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord God of hosts upon the whole land" can hardly be overlooked. Cp. also x 23, xiv 26. 7. We may finally ask about the importance of the separation of Isaiah from the people by his purification with regard to his opinion of the remnant of Israel 1). On the whole, the question seems to me to be justified whether or not essential theological elements and traditions which are con- tained in the prophecy of Isaiah are to be understood as actualized by the vision of judgment and call. We would then have to suppose that Isaiah was not of the opinion that he had actualized these theo- logical traditions by himself but he would say that they were actualized for him in his vision by Yahwe. By virtue of this fact we could realize that Isaiah has given a justification for his prophecy within his report, which contains a good deal more than scholars have observed up until now. Conclusion: What does Isaiah say about his prophetic existence in this report? He makes clear that he is a man deeply rooted in the cultic tradition of the temple in Jerusalem. He says that he had a vision corresponding to a traditional cultic pattern but directed against the traditional contents of cultic experience. And he develops the first time in the Book of Isaiah identified as King (v. 5). In contrast to the Divine King, chapters vii-viii take up the subject of two human kings who form the Syro-Ephraimite alliance (vii 1) with the avowed purpose of placing another king on the throne of Judah (vii 6)...." (p. 39). Comp. also LIEBREICH'S ar- guments for the connection between Isa vi and i-v, p. 37ff. 1) Cp. LINDBLOM, op. cit., pp. 187ff. Here LINDBLOM argues that the message of the remnant is originated in Isa vi 13 which he believes to be an authentic part of the total report. But this idea is already implied in Isaiah's own purification. 67</page><page sequence="22">KNIERIM, THE VOCATION OF ISAIAH this occurrence theologically in his prophecy to a great extent at a later time. He says that this experience motivated the beginning of his prophecy, that he would not have become a prophet without it on the basis of his traditional theology alone. Thus the actual ex- perience mediates the insight to him that God will break with tradi- tion, except in one respect. The temple and Mount Zion itself will be preserved and protected, but the legitimacy of the actual experience that God will do something new is founded on the old theology and on the traditional way of experiencing God. The prophet actual- izes the old tradition of Yahwe on Zion paradoxically in announcing the new without intending to found a new religion, or in fact doing so. But the grounds for this relation between old and new cannot be found in the quality of this man but in an unchangeable original personal experience, without which there would have been no prophet Isaiah. And we have no reason to doubt the historical reliability of this report. The experience is not new in the history of prophecy, but it is original for Isaiah. The insight into the character- istics of this prophet, into his relation to the old and the new, and into the originality of his existence, may help us to consider the prophetic function of faith, especially at the turning point of historical epochs. It shows how unpredictable, how unavailable this prophetic phenomenon was to society, and therefore how gravely it was endangered, but also how dangerous it was. 68</page></plain_text>
