My preliminary analyses of the church facades suggested that geometric canons of proportion were used in generating their designs. As soon as time allowed I delved wholeheartedly into the subject and found that geometry had indeed dictated the design of not only the facades but also the plans of the churches. In other words, the geometry was three-dimensional; it was volumetric. When I showed my drawings to the professor under whom I had studied he introduced me to the seminal research of Tons Brunes, the Danish engineer and author of The Secrets of Ancient Geometry and Its Use. In this two-volume work Brunes set forth the evolution of the early geometric system and demonstrated its application to Cheops's pyramid, Greek and Roman temples, and the Cathedral of Cologne. This simple form of geometry was derived from empirical experience based upon astronomic observation of the seasons prior to Euclid's expose of theorems. What I had uncovered in the Texas missions was no fluke. As time permitted over the ensuing years I put together a portfolio of analyses and research into the metaphysical background of geometry in order to explain the "why" of geometry in design, information presented in the 2006 publication. Not explained in that study were two additional questions: How far back into antiquity could the use of geometry be traced? And how was knowledge of the early geometry transmitted? Research to answer these questions turned into two book-length manuscripts. The antiquity question was answered in my 2011 publication of Abodes for the Gods: The Symbolism of Ancient Sacred Architecture in Eurasia. My analyses of ancient sites demonstrated that by the Ubaid III period (ca. 4500 4000 bce) Mesopotamian builders were applying geometric canons of proportion to their sacred sites. These are evident at level XIII at Tepe Gawra, where the square, the doubling of the square, the eight-pointed star, and perhaps what Brunes called the Sacred Cut were applied to the complex of three temples. It is evident at the enormous temple</page><page sequence="4">284 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest complex at Ur, begun by Ur-Nammu and his sons of Dynasty I, about 2560-2450 bce. Mensuration derived from astronomic observation was also used in Egypt as well as to lay out megalithic sites in the British Isles. It spread eastward via trade routes to India, China, and Southeast Asia. The heavenly realm of the gods was duplicated in these sites in order to ensure their continued protection and goodwill. How the knowledge of sacred geometry was transmitted is explained in The Empire Builders: A Socio-Economie History of Architects and Building Artisans from the Neolithic to the Renaissance. In Neolithic states the arcane knowledge of astronomy and geometry was under the purview of the temple schools where princes, priests, and state officials were trained. The twin subjects were carefully guarded until the classical period, when the secrets began to be disseminated outside the temple schools by former students and transmitted through brotherhoods of masons, carpenters, and black smiths. Even though the brotherhoods were being brought under state control by the period of the Roman Empire, use of the sacred geometry remained a secret through the Middle Ages. The years that went into researching these manuscripts led me into the mythologies of the people who produced sacred spaces in such multitudinous forms. Religious structures can only be understood in the context of the worldview of those who produced them. I found that the construction, or reconstruction, of a temple or other sacred space was always a reenactment of creation itself and represented the genesis of a new age. Sites were quite literally laid out with cords, which were themselves sacred. The cord can be understood as the umbilicus that tenuously links the celestial and terrestrial halves of the creating spirit who had to be sacrificed—that is, split in two—to begin the process of creation. The choice of an appropriate site, the delineation of a sacred structure, and the erection of it were accompanied by rituals that are incomprehensible unless one has some knowledge of the cosmology of the producers. Geometry arising from celestial observation was applied to sacred spaces because it was the mirror image of the realm of the gods. Geometry was not a branch of mathematics; geometry was religion. My encounters with universal myths over the years caused me to wonder whether the universality of so many tales might be due to a common Paleolithic heritage. When the first reports of DNA evidence of population movements appeared, I thought it might be a useful tool to test the spread of specific mythic themes—the routes by which the myths were dispersed, altered, or lost as our out-of-Africa ancestors</page><page sequence="5">Introduction 285 spread across Eurasia and eventually reached the Americas. I set forth the conclusions I reached through this analysis in an unpublished manu script entitled "Retrieving Tribal Memory." I introduce it here because it provides evidence for two major waves of migrants to the Americas. The first, presumably earlier, wave were those ancestors who stuck to the Eurasian coast all the way to Southeast Asia, with some ultimately spreading to the islands of the Indian and Pacific oceans via Sahulland, while others continued northward along the China Sea to reach Berin gia and the Americas. Herein I refer to this group as the Coastal Trek kers. They brought with them the mythic themes of felines, ophidians, arachnids, saurians, and turtles. The second migratory wave consisted of descendant groups that splintered from the initial Coastal Trekkers at different geographic points to follow herds of game moving northward into the heart of the continent as the ice sheets retreated. Some eventually turned west to settle Europe; others turned east to colonize Siberia and, ultimately, the Americas. Those groups will be identified as the Interior Trekkers. They were the introducers of what I will refer to as the Deer and Bear cults. In the case of the former, deer is to be understood in a generic sense: other ungulates—caprines, ovines, antelopes, or bovines were substituted depending upon the natural fauna of any given area. These migratory events, inferred from mythology, are copasetic with the recent (2008) proposal of at least two migratory waves from different parts of Asia based on the evidence of long (in depth) rather than short individual sequences of DNA. evidence. Even though Emile Durkheim and Max Weber and their followers long ago recognized the role of religion as a cohesive agent in societal development, the Mayanist Michael Coe complained in "Religion and the Rise of Mesoamerican States" (1981) that New World archaeology emphasizes material determinism "to the almost total exclusion of ideo logical factors." He further noted that "in spite of local specialization (such as tutelary deities), there was something like a pan-Mesoamerican religious system with roots in the distant past" (161). This study at least partially addresses both issues. In the following pages I examine American worldviews involving Spider Grandmother and other avatars of the Moon Goddess, such as felines and snakes, as they were, and are, reflected in sacred architecture. The survival of Spider Grandmother (best known among Pueblo and Navajo ethnic groups) into modern times in the New World affords insight into the antiquity of the goddess and the role she once played on the larger stage of human memory. In the Old World,</page><page sequence="6">286 "&gt; Journal of the Southwest largely in Melanesia and Micronesia, only vestiges of her story survive. Also covered in this study are anomalous temples and their implications for foreign contact. To keep redundancy to a minimum I briefly review these themes in this section, then in the following pages note expressions of them with bracketed identifying names or key words. The logical start is with a creation myth or, more correctly, the creation cycle, because the surviving stories in any single culture are parts of a whole that becomes clear only when all stories are examined collectively. There are two principal versions. One begins with a creative force, visualized in either human (Cosmic Man) or zoomorphic form, within whom dwells every potential for the geophysical world and all life forms. This primary creator belonged to a time when there were no opposites—such as good and evil, or male and female—and when all possibilities for opposition were in a state of balance and harmony. This being had to be sacrificed to start the process of creation, with several versions of the outcome. In the first, one half became heaven, the other earth. In another, the halves became twins of opposite character (good and evil, wise and foolish). In the earliest version these twins would have been of the opposite sex. The twins can be read into the Trickster, the capricious figure capable of both benign and malevolent acts, who was simultaneously the creator and culture hero. Alternatively, the creator was decapitated and the torso divided, thus resulting in a trinity of creation gods. A subplot of the creation cycle is the Incest Theme, which might involve the founding father and daughter, founding mother and son, founding father and son's wife, or siblings. Occurring at a time when all people and animals spoke the same language and could transmogrify into one another, the story was often recounted as the Sexual Chase, in which the female victim changes from one animal into another while attempting to escape her pursuer—only to have him change into a swifter form and, usually, overtake her. The story often ends with one or the other fleeing to the moon in shame. A second genesis myth begins with the Cosmic Egg or some variant thereof, such as a Tridacna (clam) or coconut among Pacific cultures, or a gourd in other areas. The bird species that laid the egg varies from one geographic area to another: a gander according to ancient Egyptians and Indians (who were apparently unconcerned about biological cor rectness), hornbills or chickens in Southeast Asia, or emus to Australian Aborigines. The egg or other container is broken in order to admit light and begin the process of creation, typically broken from within by the</page><page sequence="7">Introduction ■&gt; 287 children, but occasionally from without (in an American version, by the bird that laid it in the first place). Half the shell becomes the dome of heaven and is usually given a male identity, and half becomes the earth, usually associated with the female principle. Four sky poles (generally snakes) are inserted to keep the halves, or couple, apart, but to prevent their total isolation from one another a rope, representing an umbilical cord, maintains contact. (This is the significance of the measuring cord, once sacred itself, used to delineate sacred spaces.) The contents of the egg become the geographic features of the earth. An important lesson to remember from the creation myths is that all new year's customs and observances, as well as the construction or reconstruction of sacred spaces, re-create symbolically the Oneness before the initial sacrifice. The next symbols to be examined are the equal-armed Cosmic Cross that contains at its center a Cosmic Mountain topped with a Tree of Life, crowned with a bird. Emanating from the roots of the tree are four rivers that divide the earth into quadrants. These quadrants together with the mountain/tree center form a quincuncial world. As we shall see, platforms topped with pyramids represent the Cosmic Mountain in the Americas, just as they did in Old World civilizations. They become local metaphors for the axis mundi. They bridge heaven and earth, reuniting the halves of the initial creator. When heaven and the underworld are added to the cardinal directions and center, seven sacred points are recognized. In some cultures the axis mundi traverses multiple underworlds, representa tive of previous creations, and multiple heavens. Each cardinal direction and vertical level falls under the guardianship of a deity associated with a distinct color, planet, animal, plant, and element (generally fire, water, earth, and air), plus metal among metallurgists. These secondary gods are actually only aspects or manifestations of the One. Just as directional attributes reflect the faces of the creator, they likewise reflect both posi tive and negative aspects of the deity's character. Directions, therefore, may be deemed auspicious, inauspicious, or neutral. Because the sun on its diurnal course dies in the west and is reborn in the east, the west becomes the land of the dead and realm of the Moon Goddess, the east the symbol of resurrection and realm of the Sun God. Since arctic storms bring seasonal famine and death, north is also associated with notions of death among many people. This is why cemeteries in ancient India and China are located in the western or northern quadrants. The Cosmic Mountain is Mother Earth who nourishes and sustains all life. Twin peaks have always been recognized as her breasts, caves as her</page><page sequence="8">288 4- Journal of the Southwest womb, and rivers as her birth canal. In both Sumerian and Babylonian languages, the same word meant both "river" (with snake imagery) and "vagina." Volcanoes, as a source of fire, were also viewed as her womb. The Cosmic Mountain, whether volcanic or not, was the first smelter, the receptacle in which new life began. This explains her epithet as "Smelter of the Gods," and why she was associated with the hearth and mines. In Quechua her name, Mamacona is derived from mama (ores) and coya (queen or mines). Her association with heat that produced a new life or product made her the patroness of carpenters, smiths, and alchemists and explains why human embryos were once sacrificed to her. As the creator of all life she had the ability to manifest herself in any form she chose—wind, gentle rain, inanimate objects, animals, or plants. She was the Tree of Life. The species of tree, like that of the ancestral bird, varies from place to place, but is almost universally an evergreen and thus green became a symbol of life and resurrection. The Egyptian goddess Seshat was represented by the (date?) palm before she was depicted in anthropomorphic form. Some Melanesian groups recognize the goddess in the sago palm. And the ficus was the source of life to many folk, including relic populations of the Indian Ocean. (In the beliefs of all early people the creatress is associated with a food source that sustained life.) In the beliefs of many people, souls of the dead returned to the tree to await rebirth. Ergo, it became a Prophetic Tree through which the ancestors, as the source of collective wisdom, might be consulted. The Great Goddess was addressed by many names, which are actually epithets reflecting her numerous roles. Her animal avatars were legion. Very early fertility forms of the goddess were animals admired for their large clutches of eggs—including frogs, fish, snakes, turtles, and lizards associated with water. She was equated with dangerous insects like scor pions, mantids and other cannibalistic arthropods, or female arachnids that prey upon their mates. She was identified with various species of mammals (ungulates, felines, canines, and ursines), prophetic birds (owls, doves, ravens, and crows), and animals with red coloration associated with her manifestation as Goddess of the Hearth. Numerous artistic themes of compound animals—the owl eyes, deer tail, human torso, and feline paws in European cave paintings; or a spider transmogrifying into a feline, or vice versa, in South American ceramic vessels—represent either the goddess herself or a shaman undergoing those transformations. In the New World's earliest structures—be they humble houses or monumental</page><page sequence="9">Introduction &lt;r 289 ceremonial centers—we find her represented in one form or another, including her role as Moon and Sea Goddess. At the time America's colonizers arrived in Beringia, they still adhered to a lunar calendar, worshipped the Moon and Sea Goddess, and, judging from what is known of hunting-gathering societies, were either matriarchal or bi-lineal, with powerful females occupying positions as shamans and chiefs alongside men. Even into the Columbian period the Moon Goddess was as important as the Sun God. Her various avatars and attributes are so integral to understanding sacred symbolism that a brief overview is called for. She was the White Goddess or Triple God dess, who might manifest herself as the young and beautiful seductress (new moon), nurturing Mother (full moon), or Grandmother (waning moon). Additionally, she was the Death Goddess in her dark phase. Her relationship to the sun—who was her brother, her consort, or both—was adversarial. Eclipses of one by the other were interpreted as decapitations. Human sacrifices so treated can be interpreted as repeating the mythic cycle. Her roles covered the life span from the cradle to the grave. She was the goddess of fertility and childbirth and protector of children. She was the first shaman (healer and seer). Her priestesses used her alter egos—particularly spiders, snakes, canines, and birds—as prognosticators. Since she herself underwent death and was reborn in her monthly cycle, she promised rebirth to all. As goddess of death and the underworld she was associated with canines who served as guides to and guardians of the underworld. Certain birds, particularly doves, and various insects, from flies to butterflies, bore the souls of the departed. The goddess was born of the sea, as Botticelli's famous painting of her emergence from a marine bivalve reminds us. The hinges of bivalves, which resemble the vulva, became symbols of fertility and rebirth. Roman grave steles were carved with them. Pilgrims to Compostela, second only to Jerusalem as a destination in early Christendom, wore scallop shells which they used to slake their thirst at streams, and the shells still mark the various routes to the holy city. Temples built in honor of the goddess were sometimes constructed in the form of a conch. The crescent moon was the original boat, which is why boats are "shes." Since she controlled all water, the goddess owned the trees, which could not be felled to build a boat or a house without her permission. Thus, all wood constructions, whether boats or houses, were sacred undertakings with attendant rituals. This is another reason she became the patroness of carpenters and ship wrights. It explains her appellation of Tyche, the patroness of Neolithic</page><page sequence="10">290 Journal of the Southwest cities in the Mediterranean world. Significantly, the Egyptian hieroglyph for a city was the Cosmic Cross enclosed within a circle. The Moon Goddess controlled not only the tides, but all bodies of water, without which life itself cannot exist. Hence, she was associated with agriculture. In Indonesia, where she is the Rice Goddess, the grain was threshed on boat-shaped mortars. One of her earliest avatars was feline, not only because felines were believed to bring rain, but also in all probability because they tend to be nocturnal hunters. Therefore, tiger images were placed as rain charms in fields in southern India and Indonesia. The feline avatar, however, was double-edged. In the Hel lenic world the lion goddess was Hepta, representing both halves of their world: the nurturing warm sun of the growing season in winter and the withering heat of the dry season in summer. The dualism was depicted as Hepta being borne on the double-headed Sun-eagle. In the Old World the feline was often equated with the sun by day and the moon by night The crescent moon was the original bow, and therefore she was often depicted as a huntress such as Diana. In the Babylonian creation story, the god Marduk received his bow from the goddess. High-status women warriors in Central Asia were buried with their bows and marine shells. Some Mongolian women archers wear marine shells attached to their waistbands, a possible vestige of their one-time role as moon priestesses. Animals that wore the goddess's crescent symbol as horns or hoofs were sacred to her. This is why horses were anciently associated with springs and why Mongolian horses sometimes bear a conch brand today. The association of the goddess with horned beasts is vividly evident in images of Egyptian Isis wearing a crown with a full moon set within cow horns, or in the epithets by which she was addressed in the Near East, such as Lady Wild Cow. Another favorite avatar of the goddess was a snake, and in its African origin it was a python found in waterholes. In West Africa the very symbol of life is a snake with its tail in its mouth, forming a circle. The pre-Vedic goddess Ananda, depicted in the same fashion, symbolized eternity. The Rainbow Snake or Serpent is both venerated and feared from Africa to Melanesia. It is ancestral to humankind, but is also equated with fero cious storms and floods. Early images of the goddess took the form of anthropomorphic snakes. My guess is that snakes became associated with women and fertility because of the resemblance of a woman in advanced pregnancy to a boa constrictor swollen with its prey intact. However,</page><page sequence="11">Introduction -C- 291 the snake is a phallic symbol as well, and intertwined snakes, associated with cultic practices involving the fertility of women, were based upon ancient creation myths. The Rainbow Snake was a zoomorphic version of the earth-encircling Cosmic Ocean recognized in the constellations Serpens or Hydra, or more commonly in the Milky Way. The last was to Akkadians the River of the Snake or the River of the Divine Lady. In India the Milky Way was known as Nagavitki, "Path of the Snake." Many myths tell of preexisting worlds that the Maker created and sub sequently destroyed by loosing the Cosmic Ocean in the form of a sea dragon, snake, or crocodilian against the earth because the inhabitants either ignored the god's mandate to live together in harmony or failed to honor their creator as they should. In a somewhat distorted Huichol version, the flood is the result of a feud between the Sun and Moon in which the Moon sends her sea serpents to surround the earth to destroy it. In all versions of the Flood Myth an individual, or a handful of the more righteous, is spared to repopulate a new age. The epic journey of the righteous through the levels of creation, guided by a zoomorphic agent (actually a manifestation of the god), ends with the emergence into the present world through a body of water (whirlpool, rapids in a river, watery cave, or bog). The Place of Emergence, often marked by a bird or scorpion associated with the Mother Goddess, also marks the axis mundi. It is representative of the birth of both a new age and an individual, and the latter is symbolically returned there upon death to await rebirth. Snakes and dragons were read into not only rain, clouds, and seas, but fire as well. Early creation myths claiming the moon was made before the sun reflect prehistoric peoples' reliance on the night sky—the phases of the moon and the predictable appearances of major constellations—in recognizing the seasons and establishing a ceremonial calendar. Such myths also tell us that fire was originally brought from the moon and that following the flood only the snake in its tree had fire. The snake is thus interchangeable with the Tree of Life as the bridge, the axis mundi, between heaven and earth. This association accounts for snakes serving as the favored sky poles. Memories of the creatress in her avatars as bird, feline, and snake are retained among some folk. As I write I have before me a modern carved stone image purchased in Cuzco, consisting of a snake at the bottom, its raised head touching the nose of a mountain lion, which in turn is topped by a raptor (condor?). And surely it is no coincidence that the</page><page sequence="12">292 -c- Journal of the Southwest anhinga, a waterbird with a snake-like neck, has become the very symbol of Native American medicine. The goddess was, after all, the first healer or shaman. The spider avatar of the Moon Goddess, all but forgotten in the Old World except in the Pacific, survived in surprising detail in the New World. Her importance will become evident in the following three sections. Apart from the universality of the myths per se, the most compelling piece of evidence for a common out-of-Africa heritage is the same association of specific deities and stories from the creation cycle with specific stars and constellations in both the Old and New Worlds. The Milky Way as the earth-swallowing ocean serpent is one example. Another is the association of the constellation Orion with the Incest Theme from the creation cycle. The story involves an incestuous rape—more often than not involving a father in the guise of an ungulate (antelope, deer, rain bull, caprinid) violating his daughter, or involving a brother and sister— and the subsequent killing of the predator. The three belt stars in Orion are often seen as the arrow passing through his body. Other examples will be noted in the ensuing pages. The remainder of this monograph scrutinizes these myriad beliefs through both domestic and monumental architecture. Just as the temple is a microcosmic version of the macrocosm, which the deity, or dei ties, might visit, so too is the home on a humbler level. Consciously or unconsciously the home is the family's sanctified space and the hearth is its altar, its center. This is why some ethnic groups maintained perpetual fires that were rekindled ceremonially from one maintained at the com munal temple. This is also why Balinese house posts have to be correctly positioned like a growing tree. It is why offerings were placed in founda tions and why priests demarcated new house sites, oversaw the homes' construction, and blessed them. It is why household shrines were set up in the most auspicious position in the house. And as a link between the modern and most ancient of cultures we have only to bring to mind Roman and Hindu households with their wall plaques and statuettes placed in niches to honor their gods—not to mention their household snakes, which serve as reminders of the family's link to the ancestors and deities, and the good fortune they assured. I begin this study of sacred architecture in South America for several reasons. Mitochondrial DNA evidence indicates that some of the distinc tive New World haplotypes reached as far south as coastal Chile around 12,500 to 15,000 bce. Much of the symbolism incorporated into sacred</page><page sequence="13">Introduction &lt;■ 293 architecture can be deduced from the worldview and myths retained by hunter-gatherers in isolated habitats in the interior of the continent, who were scarcely influenced by the civilizations that evolved along the Pacific coast. It is among those interior tribes that we find the closest affiliations with those themes prominent in Southeast Asia and Sahulland and later dispersed into Indonesia and Oceania. The themes of totemic jaguars, snakes, saurians, and spiders were introduced by the Coastal Trekkers. These particular animal avatars of the deities were lost among those migrants who paused along the coastline of Eurasia, then eventually fol lowed game herds northward with the glacial retreat about 40,000 years ago. The avatars were "lost" in the sense that those animals were lost to memory once these peoples outdistanced the animals' natural habitat. On the other hand, they retained other totemic avatars of the gods—such as antelopes, cervids, caprinids, and ovines—that were "lost" to the Coastal Trekkers. The latter mammalian species are typically the ones introduced by a presumably later wave of migrants from Siberia. A final reason for organizing the data from south to north is that large ceremonial centers and monumental architecture in the Americas evolved along coastal Peru and spread from there to influence Mexico's first civilization, the Olmecs. When it comes to monumental architecture, there are many astonish ing artistic parallels between Old and New World matrices of civiliza tion that have intrigued scholars for generations and provoked heated controversy as to whether or not there was direct contact among them. To my knowledge some parallels between ceremonial sites mentioned in this study have never been noted before. What I demonstrate are some common cosmological beliefs brought to the Americas by the original colonists and subsequently manifested in the architecture. Whether the impetus for the rapid development of great ceremonial centers in the Americas was entirely homegrown or was influenced to some extent by foreign contact may never be settled. My demonstration that the same system of pre-Euclidean geometry was used simply adds another dimen sion to the controversy. "I"</page><page sequence="14">Sacred Architecture among Ancient People of South America The New World's oldest monumental architecture began to appear in both coastal and highland areas of Peru. We begin our search for the religious concepts manifested in it by examining settlements built by the Tairona, who did not produce monumental architecture but were adept at metallurgy and other crafts. Following that, we will look at the worldview and religious beliefs of one of their descendant groups and of others little contaminated by higher civilizations. The Chibcha-speaking Tairona, who can be traced through their ceramics back to Caribbean coastal sites dated around 200 bce, had been pushed into the mo untainous region known as the Tierradentro of Colombia by the time Spaniards arrived. The group is considered to be ancestral to the Kogi and the lesser known Wiwa, Arhuamo, and Cancuamo tribes of today. It is of particular interest to the feline theme traced in this study that the word Tairona, and related names by which the four linguistic groups of the area know these people, means "males" or "sons of the tiger (jaguar)." In the 1970s the Tairona culture became known to the outside world through the "rediscovery" of the Lost City. This settlement was composed of 184 stone-paved terraces covering some thirty-two acres, upon which round houses once stood. A population of 1,500 to 2,400 people is estimated. Larger villages have since been identified, such as Pueblito, composed of 254 terraces that may have housed a population of some 3,000. Larger cities are now believed to have been located on the western slope of the mountains. The sites, which may have developed about 900 ce, are notable not only for the terraces themselves, but for stairs, sewers, bridges, and curious subterranean burial chambers.1 In addition to the singularity of the Tairona hypogea, the chambers of which are reported to reflect their round houses, there was obvi ously something unique about their house construction that caused a sixteenth-century Spanish chronicler to note the "curious carpentry" in the thatched-roof dwellings of their king and of "three great log cabins."2 His observations suggest the use of mortise-and-tenon, tongue-and groove, or scarfing joinery. Although the first-mentioned was used in</page><page sequence="15">296 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest monumental Peruvian and Bolivian stone construction, that technique and others may have been rare outside the area. The hypogea, dating between the sixth and ninth centuries ce, were carved out of soft rock to a depth of five to eight meters, They are described as having stepped or spiral entryways, generally on the west side, that lead to a main circular or oval chamber of up to twelve meters in diameter surrounded by smaller ones. In at least one example the central chamber was carved with a domed roof and pilasters forming niches that embrace benches (figure 1). The walls and columns are painted with red, white, and black stars and diamonds. Human masks are carved into the tops of the pilasters and cornices. Ashes of the cremated dead are placed in burial urns beneath the floors. The Tierradentro hypogea bear an uncanny resemblance to Maltese/ Gozitan hypogea, which also mime architectural features (figure 2). However, the concentric diamond (lozenge, or crossed-thread) pattern of the Colombian tombs is of special interest. Generally known as the god's eye, it is a symbol of death and resurrection. The form is obviously derived from weaving, and although it was used as a final wrapping on cat mummies in Egypt, its widespread distribution throughout South east Asia, Tibet, and Indonesia suggests an Asiatic origin. In Sumatra it is associated with the hornbill, which conducts souls to the afterworld. In Tibetan Buddhism it is a "ghost trap" and certain Southeast Asian people bury god's eyes with the dead as "wings" for the soul-bird. In Thailand they are placed on graves as "ladders" to help the dead reach heaven. Laotians hang them on ghost altars erected over graves. Burmese decorate memorial posts with them, and they appear as clan totems in a certain ceremony observed by Australian Aborigines. The same symbol is sometimes carved on images of the dead on the island of Florida in the Solomons. Chancay mummies from the Middle Horizon at Ancon, Peru, have the symbol attached around the shoulders, suggesting they represent wings as they do in Southeast Asia. The same motif on Adena pottery from the Burial Mound I period (ca. 1000 bce) is likely indica tive of ceremonial use. Huichol still use the woven god's eye ritually to protect children under five. It appears to be considered the "thread of life" linking children to the Moon Goddess as the genetrix. The child is protected by being symbolically placed at the center of the two axes of the threaded diamond where the wrapping originates. The Cora and Tepehuan employ the eye for the same purpose. However, the Huichol also set up the eye in death ceremonies as "spirit traps" to entangle the</page><page sequence="16">Sacred Architecture among Ancient People of South America 297 Figure 1.

A similar object was recovered from an Ancestral Pueblo cliff dwelling (1150-1300 ce) in Arizona. Aid an "almost identical" object made by the Navajo is associated with the owl, a bird widely equated with ideas of death. In the final analysis the symbol is representative of Spider Woman, an avatar of the Moon Goddess as first weaver, or of Grandmother Spider's web-home.3 Other data link the god's eye symbol to the dead.

There, slab-built crypts decorated with various red motifs became popular: concentric circles, intersecting</page><page sequence="18">Sacred Architecture among Ancient People of South America 299 diagonal and curved lines, triangles, fern-like coils resembling question marks, and outward-opposed coils resembling horns. Another element, a polygonal crossed-thread god's eye with a tail, suggests diffusion from the mainland.7 Ceramics associated with the Tierradentro hypogea are unlike other colonial types. Kubler suggested connections with Arawak sites in east ern South America.8 This leads us to other examples of the god's eye as a symbol of the Moon and Death Goddess in her spider avatar. The Waura, located on the headwaters of the Xingu River in Brazil, manu facture woven masks painted with the same concentric diamonds as the Tierradentro tombs. They identify them as dangerous water spirits that steal "shadows" (souls) from people.9 The Kogi, a descendant tribe of the Tairona inhabiting the north ern slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia, manifest their worldview in their settlements and ceremonial structures.10 Their mountain range is envisaged as a quadripartite world upheld by four giants. Like most people, they ascribe distinct colors, animals, and characteristics to the cardinal directions. West is associated with black, eagle (male), and snake (female) and is inauspicious; north—associated with blue, opossum (male), and armadillo (female)—is likewise inauspi cious. East, the most auspicious, is seen as white and the domain of the jaguar (male) and peccary (female). South is red, with the mountain lion (male) and deer (female), as its animals and is apparently neutral. The connection between the paired animals is predators (male) who feed on prey (females). [It may be worth noting that in ancient China the Moon Goddess Xiwang Mu was associated with the west, black, and the tiger. She had the Peach of Immortality and was sometimes depicted astride a deer that had the Fungus of Immortality. The role of the deer in these contexts derives from the totemic Asiatic deer cult, the deer being the creatress who both bestowed and took life. Another Chinese creatress was Nuqua, associated with the south and red, who saved the world from the flood by repairing the dome of heaven. The eagle, associated with the west and black, brings to mind Wambli Sapa of the Sioux.] Kogi villages are divided into two sections and generally are accessed by four entrances. Ceremonial houses are considered to be divided into two areas, each with its own center-post equated with male and female. There is a division among men between those who "know more" (blue, left side facing east) who are closer to the dark, negative forces, and those who "know less" (red, right side). Four hearths are identified with the</page><page sequence="19">300 Journal of the Southwest four clans. The central post, beneath which sacred offerings are buried, represents the Sierra Nevada as the axis mundi. A shaman's seat (a small bench carved of stone or wood) is set next to it. There his small invis ible double receives answers from the gods to the shaman's questions by means of a rope suspended from the conical roof, which serves as a "telephone" line [the umbilical cord linking heaven and earth]. Around the seat the shaman places ritual objects aligned to the cardinal points. Adding the zenith and nadir to the center and cardinal points results in seven directions. The Kogi ceremonial house further conforms to a vertical universe in the form of a Cosmic Egg within which are nine strata of differing soils associated with nine daughters of the Mother Goddess linked to agriculture. Humankind lives in the fifth (black soil) layer (cf. figure 7). The four layers of the heavens are represented by four circular shelves placed in the conical roof while, theoretically, four basements extend below the floor. The egg, earth, Sierra Nevada, ceremonial house, dwelling, and tomb are all seen as the uterus of Mother Earth. Caves and crevices are viewed as birth canals, as is the funnel-shaped apex of the ceremonial house. Even Kogi burial practices correspond to the same cosmic view. The corpse, in a fetal position, is wrapped in a carrying net (womb), together with seven small packets of corn leaves placed around the body (the sacred points)—with both the wrapping and corn packets symbolizing renewal and rebirth—and is returned to the uterus of the Mother God dess. However, the deceased is still connected temporarily to this world by an umbilical cord (a rope tied to the hair on top of the head) attached to a stake. The priest regresses the body back to its embryonic state by trying to lift it nine times. The body becomes lighter with each attempt until, on the ninth, he succeeds in lowering it into the pit. The body is placed on its left side with the head toward the east [thus it faces south, the more "innocent" (?) side, home of the dead to Pawnee and other ethnic groups]. At the expiration of nine days the gestation is complete, the umbilical cord is cut, and the deceased is reborn into another world. Confirmation of the net as a symbolic uterus comes from small bags woven on other occasions as containers for offerings that are designated as "little wombs." Items that cradle something (bowls, baskets, and nets) are universal metaphors for the womb and are, therefore, linked to notions of death and rebirth. One example is the carrying basket for edibles made by</page><page sequence="20">Sacred Architecture amorig Ancient People of South America 4- 301 nomadic Maku women. These baskets are said to symbolize female productiveness, and in dreams, hallucinations and myths are compared to the womb, garden, or longhouse.11 Lono's net, used in the old Hawaiian celebration of the Makahiki, has the same significance. A net is frequently used by shamans to capture a wandering soul, and in Tibetan Buddhism, Yama, God of the Dead, is sometimes shown carrying a net to trap his victims. Ultimately, nets are symbols of the Moon and Death Goddess as first weaver. Attaching the "umbilical cord" to the top of the head is a custom also observed by both the Aztec and Hopi. The symbolism behind the practice is found in Pueblo creation myths, in which Spider Woman fashioned people from four different colors of clay, then wove a mantle of creative wisdom with which she covered them [the practice of cover ing quickens the forms]. She attached a thread of her web to the top of each individual's head to serve as a conduit of wisdom from herself to those who keep this "door" open.12 The people of Ulithi in Micronesia retain an analogous story in connection with the Great Spirit Ialulep: "in his hands he holds the thread of life of each human being and when he decides that a man is to die he utters words to that effect and tears the thread extending to the brain of the person in question."13 A Mediter ranean equivalent was the Triple Moon Goddess, who tied a measured linen thread to the end of each human being and played it out annually until the designated life course ran out, at which time she cut it and thus relinquished the soul to death.14 The Polynesian practice of "clipping the roof " of a new temple is a metaphor for cutting the umbilical cord. It is worth remembering, too, that their gods were often represented by bundles of sennit. The Desana of Colombia construct hexagonal longhouses that mir ror the pattern formed by the stars Procyon, Pollux, Capella, Canopus, Achernar, and a star in the constellation Eridanus, reflecting their six original clans and stages of life. The center pole, reflecting the Pleiades, theoretically bisects the house. Since the rising of the Pleiades marks the onset of the fruiting season, palm fruits are piled around it. Orion's belt, which straddles the equator, also marks the center. The constellation is identified as a creator/trickster/culture hero with a prodigious sexual appetite who, in this case, breaks the incest taboo by violating his mother in-law. (The same tales of his exploits are found as far as the Arawaks of Guyana.) In a ceremony of renewal Desana men dance around the house clockwise, moving through star positions marking such stages of</page><page sequence="21">302 4* Journal of the Southwest life as naming, initiation, and marriage. Women dance counterclockwise through some of the stages before joining their husbands at the mar riage position. All then return to the Pleiad center for rebirth. [If one can extrapolate from the Barasana, who inhabit the headwaters of the Orinoco in Venezuela, the Pleiades are identified with Star Woman, who governs the seasons and agriculture—hence the creatress.15] The Tukanoan of Amazonian Brazil envision the earth as an enormous hexagonal spiderweb outlined by six outstretched snakes lying head to tail or in pairs, each pair looking in a different direction. [The imagery can be understood as the earth encircled by the Cosmic Sea. Proof lies in their recognition of the Milky Way, as well as all rivers, as an anaconda.] The longhouse covers a web inhabited by a hairy, black, poisonous spider. Beneath it is a large log drum. The spider's hole is perceived as the vagina, the drum as the womb, and the drumsticks as phalluses. The spider's thread is compared to lightning and the drum to thunder, and the whole imagery is associated with an ancestral soul.16 Altars in Huichol temples are similarly located over the watery underworld of the Mother of the Western Sea, who sometimes appears as a spider. A foot dram is located in front of the altar.17 As seen in the epigraph, the Zuni believe the spiderlike water skate defined the earth by stretching its legs in all directions. Tales of Spider Grandmother guiding humankind to the present world through a body of water are still ubiquitous among Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest. Circular living spaces found among the Ge of northern and southeast ern Brazil also hint at the ancestral spider. Canella villages, for example, are laid out as a circular street surrounding a plaza. Each house is con nected to the plaza by a path, thus creating a radial pattern. Dualism is carried to an extreme here. One moiety is associated with the east, sun, day, dry season, fire, earth, red, red plants and animals, etc.; the other with the west, moon, night, rainy season, firewood, water, black plants and animals, etc. [The Chinese equated black with the north and red with the south.] Among the males there is a further dichotomy into six divisions which, in turn, determine membership in two clubs: the Falcon and Jaguar society or the Duck and Agouti society. Ge also recognize age grades. The closely related Apinaye elaborated their initiation ceremonies to a height comparable only to those of Australian Aborigines, according to Paul Radin. Ge mythology tells us that before they took their places in the sky, the brothers Sun and Moon not only created the first generation of humans from gourds [womb symbol], but laid out a circular village</page><page sequence="22">Sacred Architecture among Ancient People of South America -3" 303 for them, dividing it in half for their respective children.18 The Kraho, closely related to the Canella, also lay out their villages as a wagon wheel and observe a dual organization. Their creation myth varies but slightly: Sun and Moon themselves emerged from calabashes.19 With the worldview of some of South America's more primitive groups interpreted in the context of their settlement layout and architecture, let us now turn to how the same concepts were incorporated into the New World's earliest monumental architecture.</page><page sequence="23">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers It takes a long performance and account to complete the lighting of all the sky-earth: The fourfold siding, fourfold cornering, measuring, fourfold staking, halving the cord, stretching the cord in the sky, on the earth, the four sides, the four corners, as it is said, by the Maker, Modeler, Mother-father of life, of humankind, giver of breath, giver of heart, bearer, upbringer in the light that lasts of these born in the light, begotten in the light; worrier, knower of everything, whatever there is: sky-earth, lake-sea. —Popul Vuh, trans. Dennis Tedlock, 63-64 Monumental Architecture in Peru and Bolivia The New World's oldest monumental architecture began to appear in both coastal and highland areas of Peru during the Late Preceramic period at the same time Sumerians were erecting stepped ziggurats, Egyptians were building pyramids, and Chinese were constructing great ceremonial centers.20 What is astounding about the Peruvian achievement is that it took place prior to the manufacture of ceramics (about 2000 bce) and metal (about a millennium later). While coastal builders still relied on maritime resources they also practiced floodplain agriculture and traded marine products and salt for goods from the interior. Shortly thereafter large population centers with monumental architecture were appearing</page><page sequence="24">306 ■!■ Journal of the Southwest in the Supe and adjacent valleys of Pativilca and Fortaleza where only irrigated agriculture could account for the presence of squash, guavas, cotton, and other plants (corn, Zea mays, is conspicuous by its absence at most sites investigated so far, but may have been cultivated at Aspero). At the same time, however, these inland sites were also dependent upon marine resources for meat protein.21 The rise of the coastal monumental ceremonial centers did not occur in a vacuum, however. The Nanchoc site, located in the Zana Valley of northern Peru, features two stone-faced triangular mounds. Built during Middle Preceramic times, it was in use from about 5770 until 4000 to 3000 bce, at which time one mound was capped with stone slabs. The site is interpreted as a center of the "ritually sanctioned" production of lime, a necessary ingredient for chewing coca leaves.22 Two of the earliest coastal sites were Huaca de los Sacrificios at Aspero (2750 bce) and the neighboring one of Huaca de los Idolos (3001 bce). These were composed of multiple terraced platforms topped with square, rectangular, or trapezoidal structures. Different parts of the complex were linked by means of ramps, or either inset or projecting stairs. Constructed of stone and mud mortar, the platforms reveal evidence of reconstruction in which earlier rooms were filled with rubble to provide a surface suitable for building anew. Some sites feature circular sunken courts accessed by opposing wedge-shaped, inset staircases (a structure we shall examine more closely in time). Orientation of the mounds, even within a given site, was not necessarily consistent. The largest coastal center of El Paralso covers approximately fifty-eight hectares. Two of the largest buildings, each over four hundred meters in length, face one another at opposite ends of a seven-hectare plaza. The plaza and a small four-tiered, rectangular platform (Unit 1) on the south edge have been excavated and restored. A major stair leads to a square, red-painted structure enclosing a sunken square pit with a burnt floor in the center and small circular pits containing carbon deposits at each corner. These sunken pits for burnt offerings, equipped with flues, are a feature that continued into the Initial period, and the practice of sacrificing to the gods in this manner persisted into historic times. Grinding stones cov ered with red pigment were the most common artifact found in Unit 1, and a dedicatory offering sealed in the northwest corner consisted of a large stone sprinkled with red pigment and covered with cotton cloth, a gourd of food, and a miniature version of the fiber bags used to haul rubble for filling in rooms during rebuilding phases.</page><page sequence="25">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers &lt;■ 307 Other glimpses into religious belief and rituals involving human sacrifice are afforded at early sites. At Huaca de los Idolos a cache of thirteen small, unbaked clay figurines (most appear to be female and four appear to be pregnant) were unearthed between two floors of a small room. A second cache of 135 short sticks, carved with chevrons and other geometric patterns, and what was left of a wooden bowl carved with frogs [avatar of the Earth Mother] was found buried on the summit. Offerings recovered elsewhere in the complex consisted of bundles of both burnt and unburnt cloth, pecten shells, arrangements of red and yellow feathers, and two string crosses (ojos de dios) made of cotton thread. Unbaked clay figurines, colorful feathers and down, and a stick covered with white feathers have also been found at Rio Seco, El Paraiso, or both. An infant—wearing a beaded cap, wrapped in cotton cloth, and placed in a basket covered with another cloth and then a cane mat tied with cotton strips—was the supreme sacrifice offered to the god at Huaca de los Sacrificios. The bundle, placed under a four-legged metate, had been buried on the summit of the temple. A human skull was found buried at the center of one kiva-court at Cardal in the Lurin Valley, and in another a ceramic bottle decorated with intertwined snakes was deposited as an offering. At the coastal site of Asia headless skeletons and isolated heads were found. Clues to other deities are revealed as motifs depicted on twined cloth from these early sites: a frontal anthro pomorphic figure with flowing hair or snakes hanging from the waist, profiled cats, condors with outstretched wings and the head in profile, double-headed fish or snakes, interlocking stylized birds, or composite animals such as a snake and crab. Excavations on the peripheries of these large ceremonial sites of the Peruvian lowlands revealed resident populations. Houses had a diversity of form and construction. At Huaca Prieta square subterranean houses lined with river cobbles and roofed with whalebone and wooden beams were uncovered. Those at Asia were built aboveground of fieldstone, adobe, and clay mortar. Ocean cobbles, basalt and granite boulders, rectangular adobes, and blocks of coral were all employed in building small semi-subterranean, rectangular rooms at Alto Salaverry. Some of the houses at the latter site had centrally placed hearths. The dead were buried in flexed or semi-flexed position in shallow ovoid pits dug into refuse middens or abandoned houses. Many pre-ceramic centers have been identified reaching far inland up the Supe Valley and the adjacent valleys of Pativilca and Forteleza. There</page><page sequence="26">308 4" Journal of the Southwest are considerable differences in size. Caral's sixty-five hectares, encompass ing only the central zone, dwarfs the twelve-hectare site of Aspero at the mouth of the Supe Valley and most other sites as well. Caral's central zone is composed of a complex of six large platform mounds, numerous lesser ones, two sunken circular plazas, residential units, and other types of construction. The large mounds were erected with cut-stone retaining walls filled with river cobbles and cut-rock detritus, and finished with several layers of colored plaster. Each large mound is associated with a carefully constructed residential complex for a class of elites. Barrios were set aside elsewhere for some lesser class of residents, who lived in structures of wood poles, cane, and mud. Of particular interest to this study are the two circular sunken plazas within the central zone and a third located immediately to the west on a site known as Chupacigarro. By 1992 a total of eighteen such plazas had been identified in the Supe Valley, more than in any other area in the Andes and, based on the dates of 2415, 2290, and 2470 bce obtained for the Caral plazas, they far predate known coastal sites, where the earliest date obtained was 1970 bce. The preliminary deduction is that the Supe Valley was the birthplace of the large ceremonial complexes of platform mounds with sunken circular courts. In the next few years a fuller understanding of the relationship between these agricultural valley cities and the marine-based coastal sites, and inferences about the social structure that made these sites possible, can be expected.23 Monumental architecture in the Peruvian highlands began simultane ously with the development of the third- and fourth-millennium coastal sites. Two of the earliest were La Galgada (2821 bce) and Huaricoto (2796 bce). In the earlier phase of building, the inhabitants erected small, freestanding buildings of stone or adobe that were either round or square with rounded corners and had flat roofs of clay-coated beams. Interior walls were plastered with clay, and niches, which once presumably held clay figurines, were symmetrically placed into the walls. Clay floors were often split-level, the upper one surrounding a central stone-lined fire pit for burnt offerings, a consistent feature of the temples identified as belonging to the Kotosh Religious Tradition. Some buildings were double-chambered with separate entrances. Early temples were periodi cally rebuilt by carefully filling the rooms and constructing larger buildings over them, thus producing stepped platform mounds with stone terraces or walls finished with revetment. The type site of the Kotosh Religious Tradition is the Late Preceramic Temple of the Crossed Hands at Kotosh,</page><page sequence="27">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers &lt;■ 309 which is oriented to the cardinal directions. At that site, five niches face the entrance: four small ones bracketing a larger one. Under the two niches on either side of the central one crossed arms were modeled. Camelid or deer and guinea pig bones were deposited in the niches above them. Three headless bodies were found beneath the floor. The temple was plastered with yellow-brown clay while the entrance was painted red. A stairway up to it was painted with a white serpent. Apropos the crossed arms motif, it appears in hieroglyphs on Minoan seals.24 In South America the motif is repeated at Sechfn in Peru and on a monolith at Challapata, Bolivia, the latter in association with an equal armed cross.25 The Minoan symbol is probably related to the Egyptian hieroglyph of upraised forearms that signifies the ka, a sort of spiritual double of the pharaoh.26 Inca kings and lords were represented by a double called jjuaugue (brother). The jjuaujjue was sometimes carried into battles or, at less important festivals, substituted for the mummies usually displayed then.27 A possible explanation for the crossed-arm motif is that it derived from the custom of compacting the body for burial and was used to denote a dead person in a common early sign language. As an architectonic element therefore this symbol could identify a necropolis or the place of a soul. The site of La Galgada is dominated by two major mounds, one of which was more than five meters in height and terraced with three roughly circular revetment walls. At one time this mound was topped with at least five circular chambers built with split-level floors and central firepits. With the exception of one black temple, the others appear to have been painted white. Both colored and white feather down and a set of deer antlers were found in chamber floors. Contemporary (i.e., Preceramic) multiple burials of men, women, and children were unearthed under the temple floors as well as in gallery tombs that were made between the temples and platform walls and were entered from above. Before previewing developments that occurred in the Initial period, we need to return to the subject of circular sunken courts with wedge shaped opposing staircases. Because of their resemblance to keyhole kivas of the Pueblo Indians, these are sometimes referred to as kiva courts. They are an important link in a postulated continuity of ideas that influenced religious architecture all the way to the northern plains of North America, as will be discussed later. Appearing during Prece ramic times at such sites as Salinas de Chao, sunken courts were still being built during the Initial period. The core area now appears to be</page><page sequence="28">310 "fr Journal of the Southwest the Supe Valley, whence the idea spread as far north as Moche, as far south as Mala, and into the highlands. The site of Cardal has ten such courts placed on the outer periphery of its mounds.28 Carlos Milla Vil lena makes the case that twenty-seven of these sites served as celestial observatories in the absence of surrounding geographic profiles suitable for sighting, that they were, in fact, filled with water to function as astronomic mirrors. The most important celestial event was the zenith position of the Southern Cross, which four thousand years ago would have had sufficient height to be so reflected. The ratio of the width to the breadth of the Cross is that of the square root of 2, which was sacred to the Andinos and was the dominant proportion used in laying out ceremonial sites, while the X of the Cross became the dominant design. Thus, the sites were a reflection of the celestial kingdom of the gods and ancestors, and the X represented "the way of truth" because the diagonal in the Quechan language is ch'ekka meaning "truth." Under the Incas it became the "Route ofViracocha" (their supreme god), the label given it by Dr. Maria Schotten de D'ebneth, who demonstrated the line geodesically. It still reflected the celestial kingdom, but on a grand scale. Major cities were laid out along its path, emanating from Tihuanaku through Pucara, Cuzco, Ollantaytambo, and Cajamarca to the northwest and to Oruro and Potosf to the southeast. More star tling is that the cities are paired according to the doubling of the first square formed by the cities of Pucara and Oruro. Cuzco and Potosi are situated on a square doubled twice from the initial one. Andinos identify the Southern Cross as either a condor chasing the Celestial Llama identified in Centaur29 or, according to Allen, as a [presumed] llama doe suckling a fawn.30 Numerous holes drilled into rock outcroppings or carved stone seem to have served the same astronomical function as kiva courts, while portable reflecting mirrors were made of ceramic. Indeed, many effigy pots portray figures either holding such vessels or peering into them. A particularly telling piece of Milla Villena's thesis is a geoglyph found at the Preceramic site of Salinas de Chao, set as an accurate reflection of the Southern Cross within a stonewalled precinct. The site also shows that two diagonally opposite corners of the compound were aligned with the summer solstice during the second millennium bce. Intersolsticial stellar lines inscribed on artifacts found at the site reportedly date the site archaeoastronomically to 1856 ±115 bce, which accords well with radiocarbon dates between 1900 ± 80 and 2220 ± 160 bce.31</page><page sequence="29">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers v 311 Quite apart from the merits of Milla Villena's evidence for the align ment ofkiva courts with the Southern Cross, there is another way to view the structures. Using the site of Haldas as an example, figure 3 demon strates how the wedge-shaped stairs can be derived geometrically from the eight-pointed star. As to the relationship between the inner circles, which form a bench, and the outer circle, we find that it is derived not by doubling the square from the inner to the outer perimeter, but by the square root of 2 extension of the square circumscribed around the Figure 3. Kiva court, Haldas, Peru. The analysis shows that the staircases were derived from the eight-pointed star. (Based upon a drawing of the site in Milla Villena, Genesis de la cultura andina)</page><page sequence="30">312 Journal of the Southwest outer margin of the bench (figure 4). Here we have evidence for the use of the eight-pointed star, square root of 2, and doubling of the square which, as we shall see below, were duplicated in Anasazi kivas that were constructed some three millennia later (compare with figures 25 and 26). Figure 5 tests the same pre-Euclidian geometry against the complex of Huaca de los Reyes, a site pertaining to the Cupisnique Initial period. Lateral extensions to the central temple were likewise dictated by the square root of 2.32 These analyses do confirm Milla Villena's insistence on the importance of the square root of 2 to Andean builders. Ceramic production marks the beginning of the Initial period around 2000 bce. At this time there was greater reliance upon irrigated agri culture, as major centers of activity moved away from the coasts into the yunjja, the rich mid-valleys of the numerous rivers flowing from Figure 4. Kiva court, Haldas, Peru. The analysis shows the use of the doubling of the square and square root of 2 extensions.

Like their predecessors, these sites can be regarded as independent city-states and remained so, for the most part, until the Incas expanded into an empire. Many of the older highland sites, such as Kotosh, Shillacoto, La Galgada, and Huaricoto, continued as important ceremonial centers and perpetuated the Kotosh Religious Tradition. However, the scale of highland communities was dwarfed by the immensity of coastal ones. As in the earlier period there was consid</page><page sequence="32">314 Journal of the Southwest erable technical variation, with both stone and adobe being employed in construction, terraced and sloped platforms being built, and evidence of rebuilding and enlargement. Pacopampa, established in the highlands during the mid-Initial period, began with a natural hill that was terraced and leveled to provide an initial platform. It ended as a rectangular, three-terraced platform with sunken courts and freestanding buildings drained by a sophisticated stone-lined subterranean canal. The earliest use of volcanic tufa was at Huacaloma in the Cajamarca basin. Poro Poro, a huge complex spread over eight square kilometers in the upper Zana Valley, consists in part of a two-level terraced quadrangular platform fronting a semi-subterranean rectangular plaza. Noteworthy are the two tiers of staircases linking two more made of finely dressed and polished stone blocks with sets of large stone uprights bracketing them. A subterranean canal system lined with huge stone blocks drains the complex. Temple complexes of the central coast developed a U-shaped plan, with the largest building at the bottom and one wing disconnected from the other two to afford another entrance to the plaza. At Garagay monstrous beings separated by geometric motifs were carved and painted as friezes into the clay atrium wall of the Middle Temple. Fanged heads and a notable prominence of arachnid elements [the spider genetrix interchangeable with the jaguar] are found in the complex. An image made of composite materials and painted with large upper canines was buried as a votive offering in a small circular pit in front of a spider figure. The latter figure is dressed and has spines of the vision-producing San Pedro cactus tied to its sides. It appears to prefigure the Chavfn example seen in figure 6. The San Pedro cactus is one source of mescaline used by shamanic curers to this day Jaguar imagery dominates a temple at Punkuris, another site probably of Initial period date. At the middle of a stairway leading to the second terrace is a huge, realistically sculptured and polychromed clay jaguar head superimposed on low-relief paws. A sub-floor crypt found at the foot of the sculpture contained the decapi tated body of a woman who had been dressed around her pelvis in some sort of a garment covered with turquoise beads. Buried with her were a stone mortar and pesde, an engraved Strombus shell trumpet, a pair of Spondylusshells, and food remains. [Her death by beheading—symbolic of a lunar eclipse—and burial with turquoise and shells—attributes of the Moon and Sea Goddess—suggest the sacrifice of a woman who represented the goddess for a period of time before being killed. ]</page><page sequence="33">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers 315 The Initial period pyramid at Cerro Sechm is best known for its stone carv ings. Four construction phases have been identified. The oldest, probably dating from the Early Initial, was a terraced platform measuring thirty-four meters to a side with structures on the top. The building utilized conical adobes, their broad bases plastered to form wall sur faces, the tapered ends interlocked with clay mortar. The use of adobe cones was characteristic of the architecture of the north central and north coast of Peru. The summit complex had a central sub rectangular room flanked by smaller rooms that were painted pink on the outside and blue on the inside.

The flanking rooms were ornamented with a series of pilasters and incised and polychromed clay friezes with curvilinear motifs and dead people depicted upside down with blood flowing from their skulls. The basal platform of Phase 3 was found to have an incised and painted frieze of a pair of large fish. [It suggests the primordial world of a creative couple, such as Chinese Fuxi and Gaomei who were frequently depicted as fish. My interpretation is consistent with New World mythologies describing a previous world inhabited by fish (see figure 7).] The final phase (dated at 1519 bce) is famous for some four hundred rows of incised granite figures. Carved into smaller stones are two columns of warriors starting at the back and converging face-to-face at the main facade. On larger slabs are victorious warriors dressed in loincloths and fez-like caps with square spots and bearing staffs or darts in their hands. Some are adorned with trophy heads. Small stones depict the vanquished warriors—bodies severed at the trunk with entrails spilling out; decapitated bodies; severed heads, arms, and legs; gouged eyes; and stacked vertebrae and heads.

Four large rectangular plazas extended 1.4 kilometers from it, three of them with circular courts, and other platforms were erected lateral to the central one. Stone blocks measuring more than 1.5 meters on one side and weighing over two tons composed the outer facing of the pyramid. The Cupisnique temple complex of Huaca de los Reyes (north coast), shown in figure 5, is distinctive for its colonnades and the low-relief friezes and twelve three-dimensional feline heads sculptured from adobe that adorned the building exterior. The crowning achievement of the builders of the Initial period was Chavin de Huantar. In the words of Richard Burger, Chavin demonstrates as no other site does the "phenomenon in which fear and awe of the supernatural combined with social sanctions based on religious 'deology, produced a degree of coercion later achieved by institutionalized force" (n. 130). It is now recognized that Chavin was the culmination of some two millennia of architectural and artistic endeavors throughout Peru. The predominant feline motif which gave rise to the term Chavinoid in art history was present in earlier sites described above, such as Punkuris, Cerro Sechi'n, and Huaca de los Reyes. Technical adroitness in stone sculpture is typical of Cerro Sechin and Poro Poro as well. The elabo rate hydraulic systems realized at Chavin were evident at Pacopampa and Lazzon. Yet Chavin's influence was profound, reaching well into Mesoamerica, as we shall see in time. Initial construction at Chavin began about 900 bce, when a U-shaped platform with asymmetrical wings was built. In other words, the north, south, and central portions were uneven in height, and the north wing was narrower than the south. The open side of the U is oriented 13 degrees south of due east. The western axis is very near the azimuth of the setting of the Pleiades, or the "setting of the nadir or anti-zenith sun," about the time of construction. The wings cradled a circular sunken court. The exterior walls, which reached a height of four stories, were built up of alternating rows of thicker blocks of stone interspersed with large uprights, all set in clay mortar. Rubble and dirt were used as fill behind the walls. Set into the walls about ten meters above the ground was a row of larger-than-life carved-stone monster heads secured into the construction by tenons. The edge and soffit of the overhanging cornice were carved into profiles of jaguars and serpents.</page><page sequence="36">318 Journal of the Southwest The platforms of the Old Temple were honeycombed with narrow stone-lined passages, subterranean rooms, ramps, stairs on three levels, and ventilation ducts and drainage canals, including one extending under the circular court. The complex system of ventilation shafts and drain age canals attests to the builders' knowledge of hydraulic engineering and gives evidence of considerable advance planning and the requisite construction skills. The Holy of Holies was a small cruciform-shaped chamber located in the center of the middle wing in which a nearly fifteen-foot-tall stone sculpture known as the Lanzon was secured from floor to ceiling with tenons (figure 8). The subject has a large fanged jaguar head from which snakes issue like hair. The arms and hands are human, but the feet are clawed like a cat's. The right arm is raised, palm outward; the left lowered, palm downward. Four ropes rise from the base of the sculpture and another runs up the back from floor to ceiling. Directly above the Lanzon was a sort of keystone set in the corbelled ceiling, allowing the top of the deity to be reached by removing a single slab. Julio Tello, an early excavator of Chavfn, suggested that blood offer ings might have been poured through this opening over the Lanzon. Thomas Patterson more recently proposed an oracular function. Quite unfortunate was the destruction of the upper cruciform chamber during a landslide in 1945. [Several observations about the Lanzon are in order. This god in the form of a jaguar-monster is the axis mundi bridging heaven and the underworld and is attached to both with ropes. The four ropes at the base represent the directional elements, as does the cruciform room in which the base is attached. The fearsome visage is similar to the monster heads that evolved in Southeast Asia and Indonesia out of the Bon prototype and were later translated into the Buddhist Heruka. The positions of the arms and hands echo the mudras best known from Buddhist iconography. The right arm with palm turned outward is known as the "fear dispelling" attitude, the left arm pointing to the ground is the "boon bestowing" mudra, except that in the Asian iconography the hand would be turned palm outward as well. The example suggests that the gestures originally bridged the cosmos and may have been used in recitations of the Creation of the World since time immemorial. Also notable are the small Cosmic Crosses at the corners of the mouth and the S-shaped scrolls on the kilt. Both symbols decorate a small Chavin statue of a jaguar. The scroll may be the New World equivalent of the yin and yang, designating in this particular context the deity's dual nature.</page><page sequence="37">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers v 319 Again, these symbols of duality may have a common origin predating the colonization of the New World.]33 Throughout the Old Temple, all the imagery points to various forms and attributes of the goddess herself or of her attendants. In the Chamber of the Ornamental Beams is a com posite figure with a jaguar head and fish body [goddess of both sea and earth] surrounded by Cosmic Crosses. The most carefully constructed part of the site is the sunken circular court. [An impression of a large fossilized gastropod in the floor tells us it is the Cosmic Ocean, realm of the Moon and Sea Goddess, and the Place of Emergence into this world. Milla Villena is probably correct in suggesting such courts were filled with water to serve as mirrors reflecting the night sky. Not only would celebrants gathered around these courts at night feel truly embraced by the Milky Way (Cosmic Sea) encircling the world, but they would be doubly impressed by the court serving as a mirror, one of the primary attributes of the Moon Goddess and an item she used for prognostication.] The interior facing of the sunken court is made of two courses of carefully cut and polished rectangular slabs separated by two horizontally laid courses of faceted stones. Skillfully carved into the stones abutting the western staircase are seven (?) pairs of jaguars, organized as if in procession toward Figure 8. The Lanzon stela, showing the principal deity of the Old Temple, Chavin de Hudntar, Peru. (Redrawn from original by R. L. Burger and L. Caballero in Burger, Chavin and the Origins of Andean Civilization) the main staircase. [They may represent the jaguar deity's all-encompassing presence in the seven sacred points (center, four cardinal directions, zenith, and nadir). They converge on the western exit because this direction is generally associated with the female principle. All of the Great Goddesses of the Old World had feline avatars, perhaps because the great cats were believed to make rain and rain was linked to notions of fertility. In the Americas, west was considered to be the Land of Women by the Aztec, Huichol, and Pawnee, as examples.]</page><page sequence="38">320 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest Arranged above the jaguar are larger vertical slabs upon which anthro pomorphic figures, probably representing priests, are carved. One figure wears ear pendants and a crownlike headdress from which a jaguar tail is suspended. It carries a shield and is blowing a Strombus shell trumpet. Another figure is an anthropomorphic jaguar with fanged mouth, hair of braided snakes, and clawed hands and feet. Upon its back is a kind of bustle and it carries a staff in the form of the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus (figure 6). [It is the jaguar emerged from its cave dwelling in the mountain. If the lower arm of the "bustle" is rotated to meet the other half of the terraced mountain, it will be seen to be the cave opening. The braided snake-hair is both the rope and the umbilical cord that connects the god to the heavens from which it arrived bearing its gift of the mescaline-bearing cactus.] The Tukanoan, incidentally, retain a myth of the arrival of a woman bearing a newborn infant in her arms with its umbilical cord trailing. The newborn was the hallucinatory vine Hanisteriopsis.34 Other figures are shaman-jaguars emerging from her sacred mountain. [Earth Goddess is represented as a mountain with the cave-womb guarded by felines. They carry the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus because the Moon Goddess introduced the various mind-altering drugs to humankind.] The floor of the court is paved with yellowish stone slabs with a strip of black slabs running along the east-west axis of the Old Temple and connecting the two staircases, thus dividing the floor into halves. [The black path may represent the sun's nightly pas sage beneath the earth.] The large tenoned heads set into the exterior wall of the complex are in the nature of people being transformed'into animals (at least some are jaguars) under the influence of psychotropic drugs: they have nasal discharge caused by drug-induced irritation to the mucus membrane, according to Burger. The temple at Chavfn underwent extensive changes about five hundred years after its initial construction. An extension of the Old Temple was added to the south, topped by a pair of twin buildings of dressed stone. The goddess is here represented by a composite butterfly-jaguar [the butterfly as a vehicle of souls of the dead suggests its emphasis on death.] No staircase reached from the plaza to the summit of the New Temple. Instead, priests would appear on the top platform via stairwells not visible from the ground, which must have heightened the aura of mystery and awe. New galleries, canals, and ventilation shafts were incorporated into the bowels of the addition. The axis of the new extension, perpendicular</page><page sequence="39">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers 321 to the old, was emphasized by an elaborate portal whose ten-meter lintel was composed of two pieces, half made of white granite and half of black limestone. Emphasizing the dualism implicit in the contrasting colors of the stones are figures of a female crested (probably Harpy) eagle with water signs and a male hawk with sky emblems. Opposite the extension of the Old Chapel, a new rectangular platform was built, accessed by means of a black-and-white stone staircase opposite the black-and-white portal. A square sunken court was built within the platform, and on its southwest corner was set a ten-ton limestone slab with seven circular depressions pecked into it, possibly representing the Pleiades. The coastal societies that produced such majestic ceremonial centers during the Initial period began to disintegrate about 900 bce. New construction ceased at the U-shaped complexes in the lower valleys of the central coast. Construction abruptly halted at some sites: at Las Haldas archaeologists uncovered an unfinished central staircase where wooden survey stakes and string delineating the feature were still in situ and plastering had proceeded only to the midpoint. Some centers were abandoned and, with few exceptions, new ones were not established during the Early Horizon. Reasons for the decline are not fully under stood, although inter-societal warfare must have been responsible to some degree. The construction of citadels on defensible hill sites of the north central coast during the Early Horizon attests to unrest. Features include multiple-walled enclosures with heavy buttresses, bastions, baffled entrances, and dry moats on the most vulnerable sides. Chankillo, located four hundred kilometers north of Lima, was long considered to be such a fortified site. It is a large complex constructed on a hilltop. Three mas sive semi-ovoid walls with multiple gates surround a core composed of several constructions. The numerous gates and lack of a water supply raised doubts about its function as a fortress. It has now been identified as a solar observatory: thirteen towers along a north-south axis mark the progress of the sun from winter solstice to summer solstice from obser vation points within adjacent buildings to the west and east during the time frame of about 300 bce. It thus precedes by almost two millennia the Sun Pillars of Incaic Cuzco.35 At the same time, highland centers were prospering. Centers estab lished during the Initial period were being enlarged under peaceful conditions: there was neither a shift toward more defensible locales nor any construction of fortresses. Sites as far north as the Lambayeque and La Leche river drainages on the coast and Pacopampa in the highlands</page><page sequence="40">322 Journal of the Southwest share many common elements, including the Chavin artistic style. Quoting Richard Burger, this "might be interpreted as expressing some degree of convergence in the religious ideology and rituals of these dif ferent groups."36 Chavin took on the appearance of a cult center that attracted pilgrims from considerable distances, judging by the presence there of exotic ceramics and probable foodstuffs found in the galleries. By the Early Horizon Chavin had attracted a surrounding population of several thousand, among whom were most likely craft specialists [cer tainly architect-engineers, unless these professionals were drawn from the priesthood]. Chavin and contemporary centers now reflected what were most likely supernaturally sanctioned theocratic societies, laying the groundwork for the eventual emergence of the state. From a few graves of both sexes containing such luxury items as gold crowns and ear spools come evidence of social stratification and the emergence of an elite who probably used the Chavin cult to legitimize their wealth and positions of authority. While Chavin was evolving into a great cult center, the spectacular Moche culture along Peru's north coast made its appearance about 100 ce. A fairly recent discovery reveals new and intriguing insights into the society that produced such outstanding works of art. Evidence of female authority was unknown until lately, when the mummified body of a high-status woman was discovered at the site of El Brujo. Her golden V-shaped crown has a repousse feline head, and elaborate designs of snakes and spiders were tattooed on her arms and hands. She was buried with not only weaving tools and other feminine articles, but two ceremonial war clubs and twenty-eight spear throwers. A ceremonially garroted girl accompanied her mistress to the afterlife.37 Whereas her association with felines, snakes, and spiders (all avatars of the Great Goddess) point to her identity as a moon priestess, the weapons suggest civil authority as well. The idea is not novel. Myths from around the world, includ ing some from South America, recall a time when "women ruled" and "women owned" the sacred paraphernalia of shamanism. They reflect a matriarchal social order that once prevailed. The stories can be taken seriously. There are cultures yet, even in the Americas, where female shamans rank above males, and at the time of European contact women rulers were still found in southeastern North America. Furthermore, Inca moon priestesses ranked high on the social scale. The wife of the Inca was addressed as Moon or Daughter of the Sun, and the temple priest ess at Apurimac was a lady of noble birth. Only the moon priestesses</page><page sequence="41">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers 323 (mamaconas), who served at the Coricancha in Cuzco, were allowed to parade the idol of the Moon on public occasions.38 Such "chosen women," drawn from noble and upper-class families, were also known in ancient Mesopotamia and India. Even though Chavfn, its predecessors, or both were altering Neo lithic cultures in Mesoamerica, they made little imprint on the southern highlands, where complex societies were evolving around Lake Titicaca. Temple complexes were established on the Altiplano by 600 bce. Brightly painted buildings atop low platforms around a sunken [rectangular?] central court were decorated in an artistic style of sculpture known as the Yaya Mama, which was quite distinct from the Chavin. Its motifs were frogs, toads, heads with rayed appendages, checkered crosses, raised circles, and serpents. Ritual paraphernalia included ceremonial burners and heavily decorated ceramic trumpets. The Yaya Mama Religious Tradition linked settlements around Lake Titicaca and was centered around Chiripa on the lake's southern shore, an early area of pottery manufacture. This tradition produced the iconographic and architectural elements found in the later sites of Pucara (ca. 200 bce-200 ce) and Tihuanaku (300-1200 ce). Beginning around the start of the fourth century ce, a settlement was established near the southern end of Lake Titicaca, which by the twelfth century had become a great ceremonial center, probably surrounded by an extensive urban zone. The local Aymara knew it as Taypicala, mean ing "stone at the center (of the cosmos)," according to George Kubler; we know it as Tihuanaku.39 There are, in fact, two ceremonial centers. The earlier complex, begun in Epoch III, is composed of the truncated pyramid known as the Akapana; a large rectangular platform known as the Kalasasaya, in front of which is a semi-subterranean temple; and four additional buildings constructed on an east-west axis. The second is a U-shaped structure called Puma Punka built during Epoch IV on a north south axis two kilometers from the first. Both complexes were begun and finished during Epochs III and IV, dating between 724 and 1172 ce.40 According to a sixteenth-century source, the Akapana had at its summit a narrow chambered temple.41 Perhaps this was the 45-by-22-foot hall of stone, described by Garcilaso de la Vega, that had a roof carved in imitation of the straw covering of most houses. He also seems to refer to the Akapana when he mentioned a great stone-faced artificial mound.42 Figure 9 is a view of one wall of the semi-subterranean temple and the Kalasasaya from the floor of the former. The construction technique</page><page sequence="42">324 4" Journal of the Southwest of large upright slabs with smaller horizontal ones between is one used in the aforementioned, much earlier pre-Chavin sites of Poro Poro, Pacopampa, La Galgada, Huaricoto, and Cerro Sechi'n. The sunken structure had its prototype at Chiripa, in the Titicaca area, but the ear lier example lacked the sculptured stone heads [oval forms in the wall seen in figure 9].43 Similar heads, tenoned into the walls, were used at Chavin, as we have seen. Standing within the sunken temple is a monolith carved with a snake and a deer (?). Also found on its floor at the time of its excavation were two carved basalt bowls used for offerings—one finely incised with a design including "staff god" figures similar to the one on the Sun Gate atop the Kalasasaya.44 Milla Villena identifies this artifact as a mortar with a calendar incised on the rim and extracts a date of 688 ± 115 ce from it. The date accords well with radiocarbon dates of 778 ± 133 and 630 ± 110.45 The monolithic staff god framed by the entry at the top of the Kalasasaya is shown in greater detail in figure 10. The most impressive piece of stonework at the site is the so-called Sun Gate carved from a single stone slab (figure 11). The supreme being at the center is probably a generalized sky god, rather than a sun god. He has the weeping eyes thought to represent rain and hail, carries dual lightning-bird staffs, and is accompanied by three tiers of bird attendants likewise bearing staffs. The function of the gate and, for that matter, the Kalasasaya itself is unknown, although an upright monolith with a hole drilled into it hints at an oracular one.46 The frustrating aspect of Tihuanaku is that so much of its structure was torn down in colonial times by Spaniards and natives alike—in order to reuse its stones to build other settlements or in the search for treasure—that interpreting the site, or reconstructing it, is perhaps out of the question. Scattered as forlorn elements of its former glory are amaz ing examples of the stonecutters' art. The Spanish chronicler Fr. Bernabe Cobo noted stones so well fitted they required no mortar and finished as carefully as "pieces of wood." In his day an aqueduct of marvelous, worked stone channels was still visible.47 Figure 12 shows a stone panel with niche-like doubled Cosmic Crosses in the foreground and partially shown in the background an immense panel in which a basket-handle arch was carved. They tell us that the artisans of the Altiplano, like the Mesopotamians and Egyptians two millennia earlier, had discovered the dramatic effects of chiaroscuro in their building design. Figure 13 shows stone pavers with I-shaped depressions across adjoining pavers into which molten copper was poured to keep them from separating.

Constructed 724—1172 ce. was impressed with the pavers—the largest of which was 32 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 6 feet thick—smooth "like a well polished board, and they have many decorations and moldings on their sides."48 [This may be the earliest use in America of metal for structural purposes. Grooves, slots, and mortise-and-tenon cuts have also been observed at the site, and small holes for pegs and dowels suggest that some walls may have been covered or bordered with sheets of precious metal, a technique known from Inca times. The quality of the stonework, unsurpassed anywhere in the world at this time, was undoubtedly due in part to the use of copper tools but was based upon a long tradition of indigenous stone construction.] Between the demise of Tihuanaku around the end of the twelfth century and the reconstruction of Cuzco during the reign of Pachacutic Inca Yupanque (1438-1471 ce), terraced fortress sites were being built in the highlands around Lake Titicaca. The terraces were planted and irrigated by means of aqueducts. Typical of what archaeologists have</page><page sequence="44">326 ■{■ Journal of the Southwest Figure 10. Monolithic stuff 'god, Tihuanaku, Bolivia. Date uncertain. dubbed the Mollo culture is the trapezoid shape of house floors, walls, and doors.49 Stretch ing from Ecuador to Bolivia, the trapezoid became the signature of Inca building—most visible in door, window, and niche openings, but sometimes dictating the plan as well, as in the residential section of Ollantaytambo.50 The shape, however, had been used for temples in Preceramic times at the aforementioned sites of Huaca de los Sacrificios and Huaca de los Idolos. It is likely that in time proof of the continuity of the form over this long span of time will turn up. By the time the Incas made their presence known they were able to take advantage of the urban planning and engineering skills, as well as the master)' of stone technology, that had been perfected over many centuries. Their emphasis on lavish embellishment proclaimed their superiority to conquered kingdoms. The earlier use of gold, silver, and gemstones to decorate oracular coastal temples dedicated to Mamacocha, Goddess of the Moon and Sea, can be implied from archaeological data recov ered in the past few years in unplundered parts of temples and from the historic record. For example, at the small pyramid of Sipan (House of the Moon) burials of what were surely priests were found wearing moon-shaped headdresses and nose rings. One held a moon-shaped rattle, and his smock had a fringe of seashell-shaped gold beads.51 From the priestiy adornments and the structure itself we might infer the use of precious metals. The descriptions of the oracular Inca temples that Fr. Cobo and Garcilaso wrote in the early Spanish period provide further proof of their wealth. The cult object at the great pilgrimage center of Apurimac, dedicated to the Moon and Sea Goddess, was wrapped with a wide, heavy gold band with female breasts and was dressed in fine women's clothing. The nearby temple on the Rimac (He Who Speaks) River, dedicated to Pachacamac (Maker of the World), appears to have been constructed in the form of a snail. It was reported to have been sheathed in gold and</page><page sequence="45">Figure 11. Sun Gate, Tihuanaku, Bolivia. Date uncertain. Figure 12.

Pavers at Tihuanku interlocked with I-shaped clamps into which copper was poured.</page><page sequence="47">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers 329 silver, and numerous animal figures of the same metals were attached to the walls as votive offerings. A door giving on to a patio was ornamented with coral, turquoise, and "other things."52 The Coricancha (House of Gold) in Cuzco, however, outdid them all. The inner sanctum of this immense complex was composed of four buildings defining a square. The Sun Temple apparently occupied one complete building, and its interior ceiling and walls were covered with sheets of gold and silver, and the sheet covering the entire back wall was worked into the likeness of the sun with a round face surrounded by rays and flames. According to Garcilaso, mummies of the Inca kings, seated on golden thrones, were kept in this temple. The other three buildings were divided into five non-connecting rooms. To one side of the Sun Temple was the Moon Temple, paneled with silver and the likeness of the Moon with a woman's face. Adjacent to it, and probably in the same building since the stars were regarded as the servants of the Moon, was the Star Temple. It was devoted especially to Venus (the Sun's page) and the Pleiades (the divinities who watched over the sowing of seed and signaled the agricultural season). The Star Temple's walls were hung with sheets of silver and gold, and the ceiling was dotted with stars. The next building, opposite the Sun Temple, was dedicated to Ulapa, the Thunder and Lightning deity. It, too, had gold-hung walls, but the god himself was not represented "because they would not know how to go about it," in the words of Garcilaso. [Illapa was the original creator who was never represented visually.] The first room in the third building was devoted to the rainbow (which appeared also on the king's escutcheon) and a gold rainbow was painted across one wall. The fifth room, also in the third building, was where the high priest and his assistants—all of royal blood—conducted temple affairs. It, too, was paneled with gold. When Garcilaso visited the Coricancha as a child, nothing remained of the temples of the Moon and Stars; the others were intact, except that Spaniards had stolen the panels of precious metals. Before its destruction the patio had recesses, the surfaces of which were carved and lined with gold plaques encrusted with emeralds and turquoises. During sun festivals the Inca sat in one or the other recess, depending upon the feast being celebrated. And at certain times the patio was converted into a veritable zoological and botanical garden, with trees; flowers; corn stalks; quinoa; vegetables; fruit trees; and animals from snails and snakes to mammals, birds, and butterflies—all of silver and gold—made by the smiths attached to the temple. A last feature to be mentioned was a band of gold (three</page><page sequence="48">330 -fr Journal of the Southwest feet wide, according to Garcilaso; eleven inches according to Cobo) that encircled the buildings in the manner of a frieze.53 Construction Techniques and Artisans in Peru Numerous construction techniques used in sacred abodes have already been described in this section in connection with other points being made. This section will discuss additional methods and the professionals who employed them. Long before the period of Inca expansion, Andean Indians had learned to handle megaliths up to 150 tons, which made the construction of walls such as Sacsahuaman possible (figure 14). By the Inca period copper tools were available to artisans, but modern experimentation has shown that the tight fit could be achieved by abrasion alone, albeit that this technique would have been time-consuming. Another contemporary demonstration is that the heretofore unexplained knobs on the huge stones served as leverage points for rocking the stone back in order to shape the undersurface to achieve a tight fit to the stone beneath it. Colonial chroniclers recorded that stones used in the construction of colonial churches were laid up with a sticky red clay called llanca,54 Stones were sometimes quarried as far as twenty-two miles from their building sites.55 Juan de Betanzos claimed that stones were dragged to sites with "thick ropes made of braided sinews and braided sheepskin [llama hide]."56 Fr. Cobo confirmed that stones were dragged to the site and set into place with the use of earthen ramps—a method he personally witnessed when the cathedral of Cuzco was under construc tion.57 If rollers were used to aid human muscle, they went unnoteEi ther the Incas or their predecessors well understood the importance of good foundations. According to an informant at Machu Pichu, on-site magnetic imagery testing disclosed that the foundations were set in crenelated fashion, allowing the walls to move with earth tremors, and they were set deeply. When Pachacutic was rebuilding Cuzco, his artisans dug foundation trenches to the water table.58 Careful preplan ning at Machu Pichu is evident in canals delivering water to the site and in measures for adequate drainage—necessitating slanted terrace walls, drainage beds of sand and gravel, and drain holes—to prevent erosion. Incas' engineering genius has withstood the test of five and a half centuries.59 As noted previously, however, sophisticated hydraulic</page><page sequence="49">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers 331 Figure 14. Me/jalithic wall at Sacsahuaman, Peru. systems requiring advance planning was evident in the Initial period at Pacopampa and Chavin. Native knowledge of astronomy is known from historical accounts and confirmed by archaeoastronomers. Garcilaso's statement that the Incas had an excellent understanding of geometry can be taken seriously.60 Empirical proof of the use of pre-Euclidian geometry going back to Preceramic times has already been demonstrated. Inca kings were sometimes wont to take at least a nominal hand in laying out sites. Even Atahualpa "took up a cord and measured and traced out a house."61 No ruler had a more hands-on approach than Pachacutic Inca Yupanque. He is said to have designed his grand plan for rebuilding Cuzco with the use of clay models and to have supervised much of the work himself, even designating and measuring the stones to be taken from the quarry at Salu, some five leagues from the city. "The Inca with his own hands, along with the rest of the lords of the city, had a cord brought, indicated and measured with the cord the lots and houses that were to be made and their foundations and structures." There are additional references to "the sketch of the city and the clay painting that he had ordered made" and to his own painting and drawing</page><page sequence="50">332 Journal of the Southwest of roads and bridges to be constructed. "At the place where the temple was to be built, Inca Yupanque himself with his own hands took the cord, measured and laid out the plan of the temple of the Sun."62 Whatever the degree of involvement of the Inca himself, he had at his disposal a number of professional architects and stonemasons to build his temples, fortresses, palaces, roads, bridges, inns, and warehouses. Whenever a project was anticipated, the lords of the realm were ordered to send master builders and laborers for the construction.63 In 1549 Juan de Mori and Hernando Alonso Malpartida were informed by natives of Chupayshu, located to the north of Cuzco, that four hundred of their number worked continuously in Cuzco building walls. Christoval Xulca Condor confirmed that stonemasons and carpenters were sent to work at the capital. In particular demand, according to Garci Diez de San Miguel (1567), were stonecutters hailing from the Aymara-speaking Luparqa of the Titicaca area.64 There are hints in the Huarochiri manuscript that some ayllus(ances tor-focused bilateral kin groups) may have been craft specialists.65 Moche mold-made mud bricks uncovered at Sipan had circles, half-moons, cat's eyes, and a nose—"all symbols used on their ceramics," cut into them.66 Brick makers at Dos Cabezas marked their output with crescent moons or with three dots arranged in a triangle.67 Another mark in the form of a large central circular or ovoid depression with four smaller ones spaced equally around it has been illustrated in an article on the Chimu capital at Chan Chan.68 Whether these indicate lineage-related special ization (like ayllus), a method of keeping track of corvee labor, or guild organization is impossible to determine based on the evidence presently available. The excavators of the Huaca del Sol (early Intermediate Period Moche) uncovered walls that had been built in segments incorporating adobes predominantly bearing the identical mark. To the archaeologists this suggested evidence of corvee labor groups, each making, transport ing, and building a given structure, and leaving a record of their labor contribution. On the other hand, the crew at Batan Grande, a Middle Horizon Moche site, found a greater percentage of marked adobes, as well as a greater variety of shapes, sizes, and mud used. This evidence suggested adobes were manufactured by different groups and transported to a common depository from which unrelated builders drew. The site of Tucume—which was inhabited successively by the Lambayeque, Chimu, and Inca (covering a time span from about 1050 to about 1532 ce)— revealed the same variation as Batan Grande.69</page><page sequence="51">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers v 333 Architects and engineers were supposedly exempt from paying tribute to the Inca.70 The identities of master builders were rarely recorded. An exception was those involved in the construction of the fortress of Sacsahuaman, just outside of Cuzco. It was built at the behest of either Inca Yupanque or his son, Tupac Inca Yupanque, and, as was custom ary, was delineated with a rope.71 Within its triple enclosing walls were erected numerous buildings set in rows (figure 15) and three towers. The surviving foundation of a round tower, said to contain a reservoir with pipes radiating from it to carry water to other buildings of the citadel,72 is strikingly similar to the cartwheel-like foundations of Bud dhist stupas.73 Another tower was reportedly a residence for the king when he stayed there. Its walls were sheathed in gold and silver embossed with animals, plants, and birds. Four master architects were engaged in the construction of the fortress, which required six years to complete: Huallpu Rimachi Inca was responsible for the general plan. He was suc ceeded by Inca Maricanchi, Acahuana Inca (after whom one gate was named), and Calla Cunchuy.74 Unfortunately, Sacsahuaman, impressive even in its ruined state, lasted but a short time. Most of it was "knocked down to the ground" during Betanzos's lifetime, its stone used for the construction of Spaniards' homes in Cuzco.75 Sarmiento recorded the name of Sinchi Rocca (not to be confused with the second Inca of the Figure 15. Typical room with niches and entries at Sacsahuaman, Peru.</page><page sequence="52">334 Journal of the Southwest Figure 16. Architect's model of a fortress or palace, inscribed stone, Cuzco, Peru. (Museo e Instituto de Arqueologia, Palacio del Almimnte) same name) as the architect of edifices at Yucay, houses of the Inca at Casana (a neighborhood of Cuzco), plus other buildings constructed for the Inca around the city. He was identified as an illegitimate half-brother of the Inca Huayna Capac.76 The master builders worked from drawings and models, as indicated from the aforementioned historic sources. They also produced models in stone. Figure 16 is such a model engraved on a polished stone; it is quite remarkable in detailing both the profile and plan of the site. The profile shows a deep foundation of polygonal stone topped by a wall constructed of squarish ashlars punctured by eight trapezoidal doorways topped with stone lintels. The top of the model shows the layout of the buildings or of rooms within.77 On the floor of a room uncovered in the West Mound of Tucume a model of a trapezoidal mound had been built against the east wall; it was topped with multiple rooms (the top of the model was destroyed by rebuilding) and had an access ramp. Curiously, none of the existing platforms conform to the plan, which appears to date to the early Inca phase (1460/70-1532 ce). Later a match was found at La Centi nela, an Inca administrative center 620 miles to the south in the Chincha Valley.78 In fact, Inca artisans took particular delight in producing entire miniature landscapes carved in stone. One example at Machu Pichu is a relief map showing the twin peaks (i.e., Machu and Huayna Pichu), the</page><page sequence="53">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers ■&gt; 335 trails leading up them, and the Urabamba River coursing below. Near a high pass above the Apurimac River a boulder was discovered, the top of which is carved into terraces, canals, fields, temples, gods, monkeys, pumas, and perhaps a "fanciful model of a town."79 Fields, towns, and buildings were delineated with cords. Special care was taken to measure fields by topos (about 275 by 138 feet) and to mark them with stones.80 For surveying they had some pretty sophisticated sighting devices for laying out 90- and 45-degree angles (figure 17). The needlelike staffs resemble those held by the staff gods, a reminder that geometry and measurement re-created the skyscape and were sacred activities. These staffs were clearly related to the time-tracking devices set up around Cuzco during the reign of Pachacuti Inca Yupanque, as described by Sarmiento: In order that the precise time of sowing and harvesting might be known, and that nothing be lost, the Inca caused four poles to be set up on a high mountain to the east of Cuzco, about two varus apart, on the heads of which there were holes, by which the sun entered, in the manner of a watch or astrolabe. Observing where the sun struck the ground through these holes, at the time of sowing and harvest, marks were made on the ground. Other poles were set up in the part corresponding to the west of Cuzco for the time of harvesting the maize. Having fixed the position exactly by these poles, they built columns of stone for perpetuity in their places, of the height of the poles and with holes in like places. All round it was ordered that the ground should be paved, and on the stones certain lines were drawn, conforming to the movements of the sun entering through the holes in the columns. Thus the whole became an instrument serving for an annual time-piece, by which the times of sowing and harvesting were regulated. Persons were appointed to observe these watches and to notify to the people the times they indicated.81 Stone was quarried by drilling slots into the rock and then inserting wooden wedges. When water was poured on the wedges they swelled and split the rock (figure 18). Cutting ashlars by using grooved channels is reported at Poro Poro.82 Inca stonecutters—or perhaps more correctly artisans from the Qollasuyu, the inheritors of the Tihuanaku building tradition—were capable of exacting work. Various interlocking devices are shown in figures 19 and 20.</page><page sequence="54">Figure 17. (A-B).

They knew how to mix the adobe clay with straw to keep the bricks from cracking. They applied cactus juice to both exterior and interior walls to help the mortar adhere and keep the walls from cracking, and added wool or finely ground straw to mortars in order to produce a glossy finish.83 Numerous archaeoastronomical investigations have been carried out in the Andean area. Major buildings at Batan Grande, Pacatnamu, Huaca de la Luna, Chavin, and Chan Chan face the rising of the Pleiades. Those at Cerro Sechm, Paramonga, Tambo Colorado, and Cahuachi appear to have been oriented to the zenith and nadir sun directions. The doorway of the Huaca del Oro has sight lines on the rising positions of the sun and Pleiades. Astronomers in the upper Figure 21. Terraces at Machu Pichu, Peru.

Summer solstice and equinoctial alignments are evident at Las Salinas del Chao and La Pampa de los Pancitos.85 Cuzco had an elaborate pattern of forty-one lines radiating from the Coricancha (Sun Temple), known as the ceque system. These were sight lines, some astronomical, which incorporated both natural and manmade shrines called huacas. In addition to the expected solstitial and equinoctial alignments, there were those oriented to the Southern Cross, Venus, Pleiades, and Celestial Llama (the constellation Centaur with Alpha and Beta as the eyes). There was interest in correlating the sun's cycles to the moon's and relating both sun and moon to the stars. The three cycles were tracked with the aid of quipus, bundles of knotted cords representing numbers. Determination of planting and harvesting seasons were of major concern, as was true of all people, not to mention correlation with a ritual calendar. An interesting case has also been made that the ceque system as a whole was a calendar tied to dynastic and political myths.86 One of Peru's best known sighting devices is the Intihuatana (Quechua for "Sun Stone") carved out of the living rock at Machu Pichu (figure 22) and used for solar observation. It was not the only observatory there. A semicircular building known as the torreon (tower), was constructed as an observatory. A northeast window was oriented to the rising point of the Pleiades in the fifteenth century. An altar carved out of the liv ing rock that constitutes the floor has one straight edge pointing to the window. The rising winter (June) solstice sun would have hit its northwest edge during that time to signal Inti Raymi [the important Sun festival during which large numbers of llamas, considered to be the livestock of the Sun, were sacrificed to the god]. The eastern slope of the mountain limits visibility from the southeast window, but when sitting on the floor one can view the rising of six constellations still used by the Andinos to determine planting time and to prognosticate the success of the coming season. The same observations were substantiated at Pisac.87 A third observatory at Machu Pichu is a wide shallow cave, located in the southeast face of the site, that was partially walled up, leaving only a tunnel-like window oriented to the rising position of the December solstice sun.88 Unanswered is the question of why so many observato</page><page sequence="59">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers v 341 Figure 22. Intihuatana at Machu Pichu used for solar observation. ries were constructed on one site, but accumulating evidence suggests that Machu Pichu was a sacred city inhabited chiefly by sun priests and chosen women (70 percent of the burials were originally identified as women; 30 percent men).89 Some Comparisons between Old World and South American Monumental Architecture Quite apart from the coincidental evolution in Old and New World civili zations of ceremonial centers composed of platforms and pyramids, more particular advances in architecture should be considered. Noteworthy is the oracular temple at Rimac that appears to have been constructed in the form of a snail (in the ensuing section an analogous temple in the southeastern United States is described). The examples can be compared</page><page sequence="60">342 Journal of the Southwest to Co-loa, "City of the Conch," capital of the (Vietnamese) kingdom of Au-Lac, which was incorporated into China in 111 bce and lasted until 938 ce. According to tradition, Au-Lac, laid out with nine ramparts in the form of a conch shell, was patterned after Mt. K'un-lun, the domain of the ancient Chinese Moon Goddess, Xiwang Mu, whose animal was the white tiger.90 The shaft tombs of Colombia, described in section 1, bring to mind shaft tombs constructed beneath Shivaite temples in Java where ashes of their kings were buried. When Jayavarman II, after spending years in Java, founded the Khmer dynasty in Cambodia, he incorporated into his ceremonial centers the same Indian worldview introduced earlier from India to Java. The pattern of a central tower of corbelled construction to house the lingam (symbol of Shiva), surrounded by four lesser towers, developed into the Khmer style between 800 and 1000 ce. In this style a true stepped pyramid (unknown in India) at the center was accessed by four staircases oriented to the cardinal directions (the Cosmic Cross). It and its satellite towers represented the five peaks of sacred Mt. Kailasa (Indian Mt. Meru). Below the central pyramid were deep shafts leading to the burial tombs of Khmer royalty.91 Striking parallels in architectural and engineering advances between pre-Columbian South America and Old World sites can be cited. Skill at handling stone in the Old World developed from methods of transporting and lifting into place gigantic, unaltered megaliths in the erection of dolmen and ring sites. By early Neolithic times quarrymen on Malta and Gozo had the ability to cut doors and windows into the huge single slabs used in their temples, which predate Egypt's pyramids. Egyptian masons learned to build columns by stacking barrels of carved stone held together with wooden pegs, to keep pavers from shifting by locking them together with butterfly clamps made of wood, and to carve decorative elements into columns and walls. Greek artisans improved on Egyptian building techniques, developing other forms of clamps to lock ashlars together. They carried their skills to Persepolis, and from the Iranian Plateau the technology appears to have passed into Mauryan India through the aegis of Achaemenid masons. From the Indian subcontinent the skills spread to Indonesia and Cambodia. Superior stone technology appears far earlier in Peru than in India, Iran, and Cambodia. Carefully cut and polished ashlars were being used at Poro Poro and Chavfn before 900 bce. By the time of Tihuanaku's construction, craftsmen were able to cut a door into the huge slab</page><page sequence="61">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers ■}■ 343 that constitutes the Sun Gate with such precision that the stonework is unequaled anywhere in the world (figure 11). Also unequaled in the Old World was the skill and precision with which Andean stone cutters carved interlocking mortises and tenons into building blocks (figure 19), or abraded them to fit (figure 14). Like their Old World counter parts they also made use of I-clamps (figure 13). Unfortunately, too little attention has been given to joinery methods in tracing the origin of construction techniques in the Old World. I suspect evidence will eventually surface to show that coppersmithing and the use of copper axes coincided with the appearance of these joinery methods and that they developed hand in glove with Old World boat building, which, like temple construction, was a sacred endeavor. Apart from the developments in masonry skills, there are other parallels between the Old and New Worlds. The adobe cones used in north central and north coastal Peru in the Initial Period are curiously reminiscent of the mosaic cones used to cover columns at Sumerian Erech in the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates.92 Reminiscent of Andean engineering aptitude is the Elamite site of Choga Zambil near Susa, Persia, erected about 1250 bce. This complex included a network of tombs, tunnels, stairways, and drains in addi tion to its ziggurat. At contemporary sites builders were experiment ing with colonnaded rooms. Under the Persian Achaemenid Dynasty, which began in 560 bce, the world's first great empire expanded from the Mediterranean to the Ganges and the great ceremonial center of Persepolis was constructed. Its inspiration was the new monotheistic cult of Ahura-Mazda. Its artisans and building materials were drawn from all areas of the ancient world. Significantly, perhaps, the stone cutters were Ionians and Sardians from coastal Asia Minor, and they were probably responsible as well for the sophisticated engineering that had been introduced into the area earlier. Certain building innova tions used there are worth reviewing: entire door and window frames carved from solid blocks of stone and use of metal clamps like Andean examples described. The precious metals, woods, gemstones, and ivory used to sheath and embellish walls and beams had their counterpart in Peruvian temples extant at first European contact and perhaps at Tihuanaku as well, judging from the drilled holes in the walls there. Contrasting black-and-white stone pavements, probably symbolic of dualism, employed in Xerxes' Apadana had their counterpart at Chavin. Separate colors appropriate to each realm of the cosmos and its patron</page><page sequence="62">344 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest deity used on ziggurats surely had similar associations for Peruvian temples. The Cosmic Cross, applied vertically to Darius's rock-cut tomb, or half of the cross rendered to become the Cosmic Mountain as wall ornament, are repeated in the terrace motif that is the very symbol of Tihuanaku (figure 12). The Persian Empire was the first to integrate its territory through a network of highways and caravansaries. Its echo in the New World were the highways and hostels established by Inca kings at a later date.93 Another trait to contemplate are square stone burial towers. In Per sia they were used for signaling (fire towers) or for tombs. Canaanites constructed them for mass burials. Their parallels in Peru are cylin drical masonry towers with false vaulted roofs for collective burials which appeared as a feature of the yunjja area of the Montegrande Jequetepeque valleys of the north during the Initial period.94 The custom spread and construction diversified with adobe used as an alternative building material on square or rectangular plans. In some sites both square and round chullpa were built (figure 23). The finest example is one at Sillustani erected of finely cut, curved ashlars. The door of one such tower at Puno features bas-relief felines.95 Cieza de Leon noted that the doors of the towers were oriented to the rising sun and that sacrifices were made there by sprinkling animal blood on the buildings.96 The Collas erected their towers in rows numbering up to ten or more.97 The gold and silver zoological and botanical specimens that decorated the patio of the Coricancha during certain festivals have interesting parallels that suggest a common origin for the material representation of the Tree of Life and a Golden Age when the world was perceived to be in perfect balance. Archaeological discoveries of several bronze trees (the tallest festooned with birds, flowers, pendants, and a dragon) found in tombs at Sanxingdui, north of Chendu in Sichuan province, China, and dated to ca. 1200 bce, are the earliest known examples. [Other early archaeological examples come to mind, such as the tall treelike headdresses found from Central Asia to Korea.in the graves of what were probably shamanesses.] Gilded bronze trees and animals in Constantinople date to the tenth century ce, and in the mid-nineteenth century the Lao of Chieng Mai, a tributary of Siam, sent silver and gold trees as tribute to King Mongkut every three years. These trees may have represented the Tree of Life as a symbol of rebirth.98</page><page sequence="63">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers 345 © M"5M 5Iff Figure 23. Stone burial tower, Inca period, Lake Titicaca, Bolivia. Sacred Architecture in Ecuador and Colombia There was a time lag of about a millennium between the appearance of ceremonial centers in Peru and in Ecuador. The Chavin Horizon—with its developments in metallurgy, textile and ceramic arts, architectural and engineering sophistication, and stone sculpture—seems to have had little impact in Ecuador. Contemporary ceremonial centers are absent, the area was unfamiliar with the production of gold and silver objects (which appeared as a fully developed craft about 1000 bce), and llamas</page><page sequence="64">346 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest (which had probably become fully domesticated in the Peruvian high lands by 2500 bce) were unknown as either food or pack animals. By the beginning of the Initial period (2000 bce) during the Late Valdivia occupation, however, two Ecuadorian sites (Real Alto and Centinela), which had been established during the Early period, evolved into cer emonial centers. The former site had two rows of oval houses, each made of vertical logs coated with mud and a steeply gabled roof supported by two interior posts. The large houses, like those of the tropical forests, indicate their occupancy by extended families. The house rows delineated the long axis of a rectangular plaza at the ends of which were erected two low mounds. One, the Fiesta Mound, was resurfaced at least four times with yellow clay, and the temple on top was remodeled at least eight times. Pits within the floor held drinking bowls and special food offerings such as sea turtle and lobster tails. At the opposite end of the plaza was the Charnel Mound. On its summit was the elaborate stone lined [whether slab or cobble is unstated] tomb of an adult woman and a dismembered male sacrificial victim surrounded by seven short knives. A secondary burial of another seven adult males was found in a common grave nearby. Evidence of ceremonial activity continuing from the Late Valdivia (2000-1500 bce) through the ensuing Machalilla (1500-800 bce) periods is also found on the island of La Plata located twenty-three kilometers off the coast. The island, reached by seagoing vessels of balsa wood, was the site for harvesting pecten shells {Spondylusprinceps), which along with the conch Strombus, both warm-water species, were much in demand as ceremonial objects in Peru and thus an important item of trade into the Inca period." Summary Examined so far have been examples of sacred spaces constructed in South America that reflected cosmogenic beliefs of the Mother Goddess, especially in her avatars as feline, spider, or snake. Plans based on the square, circle, equal-armed cross (Cosmic Cross), and eight-pointed star, as well as celestial alignments, have been demonstrated in the earliest monumental architecture of coastal South America. Their temporal prior ity along the northwest coast of the southern continent, plus the feline, ophidian, and arachnid symbolism, argues for the introduction of the</page><page sequence="65">The New World's Earliest Ceremonial Centers -5- 347 underlying worldview by an earlier wave of Coastal Trekkers out of Asia rather than a later wave of colonizers from Siberia. The realization of the worldview in architecture is, of course, a relatively late development that spread northward by land through Mesoamerica, Mexico, what is now the U.S. Southwest, into the Mississippi Valley and eastward along the coast, probably by both land and, more directly, across the Caribbean. The idea of incorporating a microcosmic sea in ceremonial complexes was one such trait. A rectangular sunken court opposite the manmade "volcano" at the Olmec site of La Venta is identified as the Primordial Ocean. Mosaic pavements flank the entry into the court. Linking the space between the sacred mountain and the sunken court are two long earthen embank ments opposite one another with another mosaic pavement at its center that may have served as a ball court. Maya ball courts were considered to be entrances to the underworld as well as being bodies of water. For example, a false ball court at Copan decorated with carved stone shells and caimans makes the metaphor obvious.100 The Maya word nab offers linguistic proof: it means "ocean," "lake," or "plaza."101 The ball court equated with the entrance to the underworld references a tale from the Popul Vuh in which the heavenly twins, Hunapti and Ixbalanque, fought and bested the Xibalba (evil minions of the underworld) in a ball game. The following two sections consider other symbols, often combined as the organizational principles for certain sacred structures. ■!"</page><page sequence="66">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess [Water Strider] stretched out his arms and legs and touched the horizon at the north, west, south, and east. He was in the middle of the world. He said, "My people shall live here always. They will never be overthrown for their hearts will not be to one side of the world." —Ruth Benedict, Zuni Mythology I: 5-6 When the universe was still so dark that not even shadows could be seen in the night, Grandmother Spider sat in her web in the Sky World, waiting and watching. No one knows how old Grandmother Spider is, or how long she sat waiting for the universal mind to awaken. But, every Creative Being who has ever lived knows her song and dance as the weaver of the Web of Life. From her web, Grandmother Spider observed the first thoughts as the Universal Mind awakened from the dream. Seven energy beings floated out from the shining light in the center of the Universal Mind and solidified into bright, shining stars who went out to take their places in the Sky World. Grandmother Spider took a very deep breath and softly began to sing her weaving song while she danced across the Sky. As she spun her thread, Grandmother Spider envisioned the Web of Life. Within moments, she had woven her web con necting the seven stars [Pleiades?] and creating the Spirit Doorway through which all of the rest of life would enter. —Spider-Taino Ti, Grandmother Spider and the Web of Life You shall build the lodge like the world, round, with walls, but first you must build a sweat house of a hundred sticks.

That is the night [the Moon], —George Bird Grinnell, Blackfoot Lodge Tales, 101</page><page sequence="67">350 Journal of the Southwest The Spider Creatress and Her Sacred Architecture The spider creator as an aspect of the moon, identified by some as male and by others as female, is one of the earliest avatars of the creating spirit introduced by New World colonizers. Archaeological evidence is found in pebbles painted with cobwebs and female genitalia left by Archaic period Pecos River Focus people of Southwest Texas dating from about 7500 bce to 600-900 bce. Spiderwebs and vulvae were also incised and painted by other hunters-gatherers of Baja California. The spider creator was once widespread, not only in South America, as traced in the forego ing sections, but also across Mesoamerica and the southeastern United States. While Mayan Ixchel (goddess of sexuality, procreation, childbirth, medicine, divination, and weaving) was considered an earth deity, she was also Mistress of the Sea—in other words, she was the Moon Goddess. As in the case of her Old World equivalents, monkeys, deer, king vultures, and spiders were associated with her. The use of real spiders for divina tion in South America was echoed among Ixchel's priestesses who used small divinatory stones called am. In the Motol dialect am are small black spiders with red dots on the back. Ixchel's square [anomalous?] oracular temple on Cozumel, second only to the cenote [Place of Emergence] at Chichen Itza as a Mayan pilgrimage site, had a hollow clay model of her mortared to the wall. From a small hidden room behind it her priestesses communicated with petitioners.102 Spider Woman is ubiquitous among Pueblo groups and Navajos and was of obvious importance in the Southern Cult of the Mississippi Valley. The gorget shown in figure 24 illustrates perfectly Spider's role in not only defining the world by stretching its legs from the Place of Emergence, but also partitioning the earth into quadrants (Cosmic Cross) with its thorax (heart) defining the center. With the introduction of other cults in the Southeast over time, Spider's role in creation was remembered only in her/his trickster aspect: Iroquoian speakers recalled Spider steal ing the sun or fire (earthly sun) for the benefit of humankind. Northern Sioux, who migrated from the Southeast, tell many tales of Iktomi, the trickster-spider, but retain vestiges of its former glory. Yuwipi men use a spider song to call upon directional spirits for help: "On earth, I will call a spider friend" [Earth Mother] and "Above, I call a spotted eagle friend."103</page><page sequence="68">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess v 351 11 uichol Cosmology and Village Design Beliefs and ceremonial practices of contemporary Huichols of western Mexico, widely acknowledged as the most conservative and least altered by either indigenous high civilizations of pre-Columbian America or the influence of Chris tianity, may explain such practices as burying offerings and recon structing temples described in the previous section. Furthermore, it is a culture in which the true iden tity of Takutsi Nakawe, the old gray-haired creatress, Great Grand mother, has not been forgotten. She is the Goddess of the Western Figure 24. Shell gorget, Southern Cult Temple Mound II, Perry County, Missouri. (Redrawn from Griffin, Archeology of Eastern United States) Sea and under the name Metsa she is the moon. She was the first sun, but because she was not warm and bright enough, the gods created the sun, her adversary. In a confrontation with sun she brought forth the earth-devouring flood serpents, sparing only Wolf Man and his bitch dog, plus other animals and birds. She then [re]measured a new world.104 Her ceremonial name, Tukari, means "has become spider" and, like Ixchel, she is associated with fertility, birthing, and midwifery. During the dark phase of the moon she is called Tukakame (One Who Is Spider), the death goddess and ogress. The Huichol also tell of a large, hairy subterranean spider, Utsa, who dug out the burial room for the first generation of people, wove their burial shrouds, and later sang them back to life—just as Sowuhti stirred them to life in the Hopi myth. The Huichol universe is ordered in terms of five cardinal directions and the center, which is the vertical intersect of heaven and underworld. In the San Andreas region of Nayarit five ceremonial centers with round temples (tuki) of adobe or stone with thatched roofs reflect that worldview.105 These sacred precincts, composed of tuki [from tuka, spider] and small family shrines, or "god houses" (xiriki), are currently</page><page sequence="69">352 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest located in satellite communities known as Morning Star, Rain Serpent, Rattlesnake, Place Where First Brazil Trees Appeared, and Sun's Bird (eagle). The sacred structures are indistinguishable from dwellings except for a carved stone with a hole set in the gable as an entry and exit for the gods. Construction of the first temple was completed in accordance with the directions given by Grandfather Fire and under the supervision of his spirit helper, the trickster and divine culture hero Elder Brother. Elder Brother's help is always invoked when a temple is to be rebuilt every five years in order to reorder the cosmos, the deities, and a newly initiated group of townsfolk who will be in charge of all ceremonies and care of the precinct for the ensuing five years. Before reconstruction the old temple is razed; animals are sacrificed; and within the circle of rubble there is a ritual exchange of food, maize beer, distilled alcohol, tobacco, and offerings passed from the old temple members to the new. The most important building elements are two pine posts and a ridgepole that will support the roof. Two pine trees, considered major rain gods (perhaps because as the tallest they attract lightning), are decorated, ritually cut, and shaped into the three structural elements. One tree is brought from the east where the male god of lightning and thunder dwells; the other from the western home of the rain goddess representing steady, gentle rains. Under the influence of peyote the posts are seen as snakes, the animal form of the rain goddess. The goddess becomes a rattlesnake in the dry season; the god is transformed into a blue corn snake during the rainy season. [It is worth noting that an Ottasse (Creek) ceremonial center visited by Bartram had four open-fronted buildings defining a plaza with a pine menhir at its center. The buildings were fronted with pillars representing serpents. Bartram recorded other zoomorphic and anthropomorphic sculptures.106] The roof is symbolic of the upper world and the temple the middle world. [These are therefore the same snake pillars that upheld the dome of heaven in the Pacific world. ] As the walls are built up, niches dedicated to the principal deities are cre ated; offerings of a votive arrow [phallic symbol], a decorated gourd bowl [womb symbol], a carved image of maize, and the stone form of the deity are placed in these niches and covered over, as ordered by the Earth Goddess in the myth of the first temple. The location of each niche is marked with deer antlers affixed to the interior wall. An altar is built along the west wall. In one temple the altar is built in the form of a stepped pyramid, said by informants to be the more ancient style—as</page><page sequence="70">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess 353 a stairway to be used by Sun when he completes his journey across the sky and descends to the underworld. Communication with the underworld is maintained by means of three holes dug into the floor. One, located beneath the altar, is for the Mother of the Western Sea who receives the setting sun. In front of the altar is a foot drum in the form of a hollowed-out wooden bench used by dancers whose stomping feet awaken the gods to lure them to par ticipate in the ceremonies and answer prayers. A second hole, located in front of the shaman's seat, is dedicated to Tumamei (Venus), and when the shaman sings directly into the hole at his feet, he becomes the god himself as he accompanies the Sun God on his nocturnal journey from the west to the east through the underworld.107 Offerings placed in the hole are dressed wooden images of the old Earth and Creator Goddess Tukutsi; Tatewari, the personified Fire; Paritsika, associated with the birth of the Sun, deer hunting, and spirit master of game; and Kariwari, a rain and water deity. A circular tufa disk, incised with deer and eagle images, covers the hole when not in use. The third hole, located beneath the hearth itself, is appropriately dedicated to the Fire God. Deposited within the hole are offerings of wood or clay figures of deer, cattle, and other animals made and changed by new patrons of the temple every five years. [The hearth is the smelter of the Earth Mother.] The hole is not opened except with the cyclic change. When celebrants ingest peyote the Fire God himself, in his animal form as protector of animals, appears in the flames. Deer masks hung on the posts assure the presence of the deer spirits at all gatherings as well as luck in hunting and bringing rain. Logs for the ceremonial fire are laid in spoke fashion, repeating the radial placement of the rafters from the ridgepole to the walls. When the structure of the main Huichol temple is ready to be dedi cated, members of the other four temples place offerings in the roof in the directions with which they are associated. The offerings consist of five kinds of plants, a gourd bowl, an arrow, and a candle, all bound together with two ropes of palm fiber that divide the roof into quad rants. [One plant is a vine representing souls of the patrons and thus serves as the sacred umbilicus linking them with the cosmic levels.] Individual members of the patronage group are each responsible for one deity entombed in the wall and sit directly under the antlers that designate its hidden niche. In the past the spot was further marked with designs on the wall associated with the specific god, a bull for the Sun God, for example.</page><page sequence="71">354 Journal of the Southwest In addition to the foregoing symbolism, these temples reflect a dual ism central to the Huichol belief system, which is remarkably like that of the Kogi described in section 1. Stacy Schaefer suggests that the belief system, taken together with the organization of temple members and families, represents an old moiety and clan system whose members derived their descent from common, though not necessarily human, ancestors. [A point to keep in mind is that the Cosmic Cross is implicit in the conceptual, although not the visual arrangement of these circular structures.] One directional halving of the tuki is east to west, associ ated with the sun and moon, respectively. The more complex halving is north to south. The door faces east and an imaginary line from there across the three entries to the underworld and the altar on the west wall divides the space into the dry season on the south and the rainy season on the north—each side equated with its particular deities. This halving extends to the plaza in front where two god houses are located. As one faces the facade the god house on the south side (dry season) is dedicated to Paritkika, god of the hunt and guardian of the animals. It is considered the "right" side because it is on the right side as one faces the sun. The one on the north side (rainy season) belongs to Tatutsi Maxa Kwaxi, Great-Grandfather Deer Tail. Both sides therefore reference the most sacred rite of the Huichol, the annual peyote hunt to the sacred desert area of Werikuta in San Luis Potosi, the probable ancestral home of the tribe as well. Deer Tail may have been the real-life shaman-chief who led his followers into the Sierra Madre Occidental over a trail still followed by peyoteros.108 The ritual deer hunt and peyote pilgrimage falls between December and the beginning of spring as part of the dry season ceremonial calendar.109 Peyote is the bridge between past and present for the Huichols. These people may be those known to the Spaniards in colonial times as the wide-ranging Guachichiles, or at least a branch of them. Circumstances forced upon them a sudden change in lifestyle from nomadic hunting and gathering to sedentary agriculture, to which they responded with a synthesis equating peyote, deer, and maize. The annual hunt is thus both a historical and a mythical return to the original homeland and way of life. It is the symbolic re-creation of a time when there was no separation between men and gods, plants and animals, life and death, the natural and supernatural, or the sexes. Men on the hunt become gods, and the climax comes when they slay and eat the peyote. All dif ferences dissolve and unity is restored. There is unification among the</page><page sequence="72">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess 355 three symbols, as Barbara Myerhoff argues. The deer is equated with the past, hunting, masculinity, independence, adventure, and freedom. Maize is the labor of the present, food, regularity, domesticity, sharing between sexes, routine, and diligence. The peyote [which, incidentally, is viewed as female, as is maize] is both plant and animal. It is nonutilitarian and independent of time, sex, and specific meaning. Its use is strictly a personal experience having nothing to do with shared sentiments, mor als, ethics, or dogma.110 All five tuki of the San Andreas Huichols serve as solar observatories. The east-west axis is oriented such that on the fall and spring equinoxes, the sun's rays reach to the back wall where they "climb" the stairs of the altar. At the summer and winter solstices the sun shines through one or the other of two small windows located on either side of the door. The gods houses in front are aligned so that summer and winter solstitial rays penetrate the holes drilled into the centers of the stone disks set into the gables. Moreover, the daily path of the sun is tracked: early-morning rays creep into the temple at ground level from the door, at midday they come through an opening in the roof to illuminate the hearth or the area around one or the other of the posts, and finally as sunset approaches, penetrate a third window located above the altar. The Huichols' sophistication in aligning their sacred structures with the seasonal cycles brings to mind a roof window in the large communal round houses constructed by the Yekuana, located on the headwaters of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. As Anthony Aveni describes it, "The window serves the function of making out the yearly calendar by fol lowing the sunbeam—entering the window—sweep across the interior opposite wall. Daily time can be measured by the simultaneous ascension of the light shaft up the central zenith pole of the house. The light beam also serves the religious purpose of following the sun upward through the interior roof space, symbolizing the cosmic vault, to the apex of the structure where the Supreme Being is at home and where he plays out the game of the seasonal cycle."111 Pueblo Cosmology and Kivas Around the first century ce and long before the Huichols became sedentary farmers, the people who had previously lived in caves and overhangs in the Four Corners area of the American Southwest began</page><page sequence="73">356 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest constructing square, semi-subterranean pit houses, each with a side tunnel that functioned as both entry and air vent. A stone slab set on end between the entrance and the central fire hearth deflected air cur rents from the fire. A smoke hole was opened in the roof. Over time the tunneled entrance shrank to an air vent and entrance was achieved through the smoke hole by means of a ladder. Additionally, a small hole (sipapu) was dug, representing the place of emergence where the Pueblo people came into the Fourth World. This is analogous to the Huichol altar. Some of the dwellings were equipped with a bench around the perimeter for sitting and sleeping. Around 700 ce Pueblo people first began building alternative dwellings in the form of aboveground rows of square rooms sharing common walls. By about 950 they had expanded those first apartment houses into pueblos occupied year-round and the pit house, now circular, became the sacred ceremonial structure. The acme of development occurred between 1100 and 1300 with the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde and the open sites in Chaco Canyon. At the latter, Pueblo Bonito became the hub of nine major Great Houses, or multistoried apartments. A system of roads radiating from Pueblo Bonito linked outlying pueblos and beyond in a vast trade network (the pres ence of macaw feathers and copper bells tell of trade deep into Mexico). Events in the hinterland were rapidly communicated by means of fire signals. By 1070 the large D-shaped complex of Pueblo Bonito rose at least four stories high, with 800 rooms and 37 kivas. The pueblo was divided into irregular halves by a row of buildings perpendicular to the flat, southward-facing side of the D. The population density of Chaco's various settlements was maintained by a sophisticated system of darns, floodgates, ditches, and reservoirs to maximize summer rains.112 The buildings in Chaco Canyon were beautifully constructed of sandstone slabs. Some walls feature bands of wider slabs interspersed with multiple thinner ones, producing a pleasing effect. Rooms were engineered with a marvelous system of air vents. The stability of the high walls was ensured by tapering them from a base thickness of three feet to a top thickness of one foot. The T-shaped door is as much a signature of developed Ancestral Pueblo architecture as the trapezoid door is of Inca building. Innovadons occurred in kiva design. Great kivas were built (Casa Rinconada in Chaco Canyon is sixty-three feet in diameter) and keyhole kivas developed. Benches were plastered, and pilasters or posts seated on them could support greater expanses of corbelled log roofs. Walls were decorated with polychrome murals and foot drums were added.</page><page sequence="74">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess -fr 357 Matching the accomplishments of air-vented apartments and hydraulic engineering is the use of geometric canons of proportion in kiva con struction. The first example is Chetro Ketl in Chaco Canyon (figure 25). The careful placement of the eight pilasters, vent outlet, deflector, hearth, and foot drum in relation to the basic circle and circle's square is obvious (left illustration). The geometric relationship of the walls to the bench is found as a root-2 extension ofx/ 16th part of the basic square (right illustration). My drawings do not reflect the fact that the kiva shown replaced an earlier one whose center would have been in the firepit. The second example is a keyhole kiva from Mug House, Mesa Verde (figure 26). In this case the basic circle coincides with the bench, but note again the careful alignment of features in accordance with the eight-pointed star. Compare this analysis with that of the Kiva Court at Figure 25. Kiva at Chetro Ketl, Chaco Canyon. The relationship of the parts to the whole manifests in the eight-pointed star.

(Based upon drawing in Rohn, Wetherill Mesa Excavations) Haldas, Peru in figure 3. In the Mug House kiva, like the Chetro Ketl kiva, the relationship of the bench to the wall is a root-2 extension from the diagonal of Vigth part of the basic square (right illustration). The length of the entry is dictated by a root-3 extension from the diagonal of 1/4th part of the basic square (left illustration). The great Ancestral Pueblo population centers began to crash during the thirteenth century ce. Chaco Canyon was abandoned by the early 1200s. Indians at Mesa Verde and elsewhere managed to hang on a bit longer, but all sites were abandoned by the end of the century. Degrada tion of the environment, a prolonged drought, and internecine warfare appear to be the prime contributing factors. Clues to the dispersal of the Ancestral Pueblos are beginning to emerge. One area of investiga tion focuses on a high, defensible flat area above the Kayenta Valley in Colorado as the locus of relocation for some of the people. In the 1300s some new development, possibly the kachina cult, lured them down</page><page sequence="76">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess &lt;■ 359 from the Colorado Plateau, the traditional homeland remembered by most Pueblos. The Jemez claim their ancestors ceased their wandering at Kwanstiyukwa (Place of the Pine Bird), and the ruins of a huge village of some 2,500 rooms and pottery dating to the 1300s lend credence to that tradition.113 A sizeable group of Ancestral Pueblos appear to have moved into the southern half of New Mexico, where they reestablished themselves into three new villages around 1300. These villages together may account for some eight hundred rooms.114 Every part of the modern kiva is symbolic. It represents the primordial underworld home, the term actually used for it when the gods (kachinas) from the underworld are in residence. Their impersonators reenact the original emergence from the underworld. Like the Huichol temple, every kiva replicates the mythic First Kiva, according to Acoma mythology. The ladder is the rainbow bridge that links the under, middle, and upper worlds. Four different trees used for the roof beams represent those used by the people to climb from the underworld. The walls are the sky, the roof, the Milky Way. The bench is provided for the mountain spirits to rest during ceremonies. The square fireplace is covered with wooden boards to act as a foot drum. The smoke hole is interpreted as the door to the north, east, and western mountains, as well as the Sun and Moon, and is the locus of prayers offered to these powers. Offerings to the spirits of the four directions are made under the foundation. These consist of prayer sticks, yellow "turquoise" to the north, blue to the west, red to the south, and white to the east. [These are equivalent to the votive arrow and stones in which the gods reside immured in the Huichol temple.] The Hopi differ in having square kivas, but the symbolism is otherwise similar. The three previous worlds are represented by the sipapu, as the First World and navel of the earth, and the two levels of the floor as the Second and Third Worlds. The current Fourth World is above the hatchway. The ladder is "invariably made of pine,"115 representing that used in one ascent to another world. Since Spider Woman served as guide for this emergence, her presence in the kiva must be implicit. It is also surely significant that the Hopi have a Spider Clan. Native Americans' widespread identification of an evergreen (generally a pine) as the Tree of Life indicates its introduction by early colonists. The Huichols' use of pine for their two main posts and ridgepole, plus the semi-legendary Kwanstiyukwa (Place of the Pine Bird) have already been mentioned. Pine is associated with the Sioux Thunderbird and north (below). The ithyphallic twin War Gods of Zuni are carved from</page><page sequence="77">360 -fr Journal of the Southwest the wood of a pine tree struck by lightning.116 A pine tree menhir (pil lar) was probably the central feature in all ceremonial plazas of the great southeastern U.S. civilizations, at least at certain times of the year. The English botanist William Bartram noted them among the Creeks, and the Spanish Franciscan Padre Isidro Felix de Espinosa penned an account of their importance among Caddoan peoples. Given the universality of the maypole it is not surprising to find it associated with an important May celebration among the latter. Espinosa reported that at the beginning of the month a tall, slim, straight pine was stripped, except for a crest, and placed on a cleared level field, and two wide paths were laid in circles surrounding it. The most robust and fleet men were chosen to run the race. The winner was he who completed the most revolutions around the pole without pausing. The rite concluded with refreshments provided by the women.117 Pine poles were used for ceremonial flying in central Mexico. On the other hand, the fir (called a spruce by the Zuni, Hopi, and Keresans) is said to be the tree of the north for these three groups.118 Maya re-create the Yaxche (first or green tree) by erecting substitute Latin crosses, "activate" them by attaching the crown of a yellow pine tree at the top, and lay a carpet of fresh pine needles at the feet.119 Andinos, too, erect ostensibly Christian crosses, with the head of Christ crowned with thorns at the crossing. But the cross is green, a living tree as a symbol of resurrection—and the cross is "dressed" in a tunic embroidered with a flowering tree, plus a stole around the shoulders.120 Mention was made earlier to the great kiva in Chaco Canyon known as Casa Rinconada. This structure, built in the early twelfth century, was separated from other buildings and perhaps served as the ceremonial meeting place for several clans or religious groups from various villages. Like the pueblos on the Rio Grande the kiva is aligned with the cardinal directions (Hopi and Zuni kivas have solstitial alignments). At summer solstice the first rays of the sun shine though the single northeast window, hitting a wall and creeping down that wall to illuminate a niche. A few days after the vernal equinox, and again before the autumnal equinox, a shadow falls across half of the kiva when the sun passes behind the edge of the mesa. Modern counterparts to the alignment of Casa Rinconada are the kivas and other ceremonial rooms in Hopi, Zuni, Isleta, and Cochitf where the sun enters their portals at the solstices or at other crucial times in the ceremonial calendar.121 In Hopi cosmology the cardinal directions are dictated by sunrise and sunset at the summer and winter solstices. The ceremonial circuit</page><page sequence="78">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess 4- 361 is counterclockwise beginning with the northwest and ending with the northeast. Each direction is replete with symbolism. Associated with the northwest (i.e., summer solstice) sunset are yellow corn ear, oriole and another unidentified yellow bird skin, corn, mountain lion, and deer. Things equated with the southwest (winter solstice) sunset are blue green corn ear, jay and bluebird skins, beans, black bear, and mountain sheep. With the southeast (winter solstice) sunrise we find red corn ear, red-shafted woodpecker and house finch skins, parrot or macaw, squash, gray wolf, and antelope. Associated with the northeast (summer solstice) sunrise are white corn ear, warbler and another unidentified bird skin, cotton, wildcat, and elk. Equated with the vertical axes are the color black, cliff swallow, watermelon, golden eagle, and jackrabbit for the zenith; and all colors, canyon wren, all kinds of crops, badger, and cottontail for the nadir.122 To the Oglala, a swallow's flight precedes a thunderstorm. Thus, the association of black and the cliff swallow with the zenith in Hopi cosmology possibly has the same meaning.123 Hopi sun shrines mark the sunrise positions at winter and summer solstices. Termed the "Sun's house," they are sacred, and feathered prayer sticks (pahos) are deposited at them on the solstices. These shrines provide one of the fixed points for sun watchers, but are too far distant from villages to serve as distant foresights. The sacred San Francisco Peaks, home of the kachinas, are in the general direction of the winter sunset. Horizon features to the east are used for tracking the sun's progress from southeast to northeast and are linked to planting different crops. When the sun leaves his summer house, the Sun Priest relinquishes his position as sun tracker to an elder of the clan principally responsible for the forthcoming ceremony of Niman, which occurs in July when the kachinas return to their mountain home. It is followed by Wuwuchim in November, when the tribal initiation is held. Afterward the Sun Priest takes over again to watch for the time of the Soyal ceremony at winter solstice when the kachinas return. [Note that the kachinas' emergence from the underworld to this is reenacted at the winter solstice, when the days begin to lengthen. In other words, the emergence is from dark to light and to a new cycle of life.] All of this, of course, also pertains to the divided ceremonial duties of the moieties, the Summer People and the Winter People, and reflects the dualism of dry and rainy seasons observed by the Huichols. Dualism is also reflected in the repetition of month names for the two halves of the year, a trait shared with other Pueblo groups and Southern California Indians.124</page><page sequence="79">362 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest o ther Circular Structures The remarkable development of Peruvian architectural and artistic forms that culminated with the Chavi'n culture had a profound effect upon Mesoamerica's first great civilization, the Olmec. It arose out of a cluster of traits transmitted from Ecuador and Colombia between 1700 and 1300 bce and mingled with local cultures with astonishing results. The Olmec developed in two areas—one on the Gulf coast in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco, the other in the state of Guerrero—and achieved full development between 1200 and 800 bce. A major 1400 bce site in Guerrero is Teopantecuanitlan (Place of the Temple of the Jaguar Gods). It has a sunken courtyard with jaguar heads of carved travertine placed on two of the four enclosing walls. [From the brief description it sounds as though it could fit right into the pre-Chavfn developments noted earlier.] Related sites that extend back to 2000 bce are found along a narrow coastal strip from Chiapas into El Salvador, probably indicating diffusion up the Pacific coast from South America.125 Archaeology conducted in western Mexican states sheds considerable light on cultures previously known mostly from looted tombs in the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, and Michoacan. The style and iconography of associated funerary art and the architecture itself are quite unlike those of other areas of Mesoamerica. Hollow clay figures of people engaged in all sorts of activities reveal much about types of clothing, ways of dressing hair, textile art, and body painting or tattooing. Some richly furnished shaft tombs located in the latter two states are dated to the Early Formative (ca. 1500-1000 bce). During the Middle Formative (ca. 1000-300 bce) circular or oval burial platforms, each with two or more deep shaft tombs, as well as simple pit burials, were being built around the lakes of Jalisco as ceremonial centers for dispersed settlements. By the Late Formative (ca. 300 bce-200 ce) such sites were evolving toward greater complexity in what became known as the Teuchitlan Tradition. It will be considered in a later section of this work. The typical shaft tomb is about fifteen feet deep with two chambers at the base on a north-south axis connected to a narrow shaft of no more than three feet in diameter. El Arenal near Etzatlan, Jalisco, has a forty five-foot shaft leading to three vaulted chambers with groined intersec tions. Even deeper shafts have since been found. Certain evidence suggests that some of these were excavated into house forms, and house models</page><page sequence="80">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess &lt;■ 363 are often found among the grave offerings. It is therefore of interest that in recent years a Huichol shaman was buried beneath his dwelling to maintain the link between the living and the dead. Kubler noted the similarity of west Mexican shaft; tombs to those of the San Andreas area of Tierradentro province (desribed earlier).126 The shaft tombs and circular or ovoid terraces of the Tairona, plus the fact that both the Tairona and natives of Guerrero were noted as excellent craftsmen in the arts of cut ting semiprecious stones, such as quartz and carnelian, and of smelting gold may indicate actual contact between the two cultures. Western Mexico's early experiment with circular sacred buildings is relatively rare in Mesoamerica. The idea is said to have survived only in relatively modest structures in the Bolanos Valley of northernmost Jalisco through the Postclassic.127 The idea of the circular platform did spread inland during the Preclassic, however. A round platform was used for a pyramid at Cuicuilco. In the Aztec period the circular temple was equated with Quetzalcoad-Ehecatl. Among the gifts given to Quetzalcoatl by the Dual Lord and Lady were four temples, the second being round because it belonged to his mother, the Moon Goddess. At Calixtlahuaca, located on a plateau west of Tenochtitian, a four-tiered circular platform was built for a temple dedicated to Ehecatl. The structure had a large, low dais in front from which a staircase rose to the top. Upon the dais stood a larger-than-life stone statue of the god.128 Circular temples are reported also from San Luis Potosi, and round house forms were built on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. A logical conclusion to be drawn from the Aztec myth is that Inca Pachacamac bore the same relationship to Mamacocha, the Sea and Moon Goddess, as Quetzalcoatl did to his Moon Goddess mother, Coatlicue. The snail imagery for a temple, already described, was found in the southeastern United States as well. The naturalist William Bartram, an early visitor to a site four or five miles above Fort James, located between the Broad and Savannah rivers on the Georgia side of the border with South Carolina, described a ruined ceremonial center: The great mount is in the form of a cone, about forty or fifty feet high, and the circumference of its base two or three hundred yards, entirely composed of the loamy rich earth of the low grounds; the top or apex is flat; a spiral path or track leading from the ground up to the top is still visible . . . there appear four niches, excavated</page><page sequence="81">364 4" Journal of the Southwest out of the sides of this hill, at different heights from the base, fronting the four cardinal points; these niches or sentry boxes are entered into from the winding path, and seem to have been meant for resting places or look-outs.129 About the time of the demise of the Teuchitlan Tradition, the Taras cans first appeared around Lake Chapala in Jalisco and began building an empire that stretched into Colima, Michoacan, and Guerrero at the time of the Spanish conquest. One of the many enigmas of western Mexico has long been the great temple mound the Tarascans erected at Tzintzuntzan, Michoacan, which is so unlike any other site in Meso america. It was built as an immense rectangular ten-stepped platform with a height of forty-three feet made accessible by a projecting staircase. On top of this were erected five T-shaped, twelve-stepped burial mounds with perpendicular extensions ending in circular platforms on which stood round shrines with tall thatched roofs. This imposing structure was built of dry-laid rough stone slabs and rubble and faced with cut stone slabs of lava, "sometimes curiously interlocked in the angles as in Peruvian structures," according to Miguel Covarrubias. Two burials, one containing five women, the other nine men, were found in the sides of the round platform. They contained rich burial goods, although the pottery had been ritually broken.130 Tzintzuntzan is an eerie echo of the aforementioned Galgada stepped platform topped with five nearly circular temples with burial chambers and galleries beneath their floors. Round ceremonial structures may have been introduced from this area of Michoacan to the neighboring state of Guerrero to the south, specifi cally the Balsas River area. Michoacan is also one of three critical points, the others being the coastal area of Ecuador-Colombia and the northwest coast of North America—where some contacts may have occurred with Asiatic and Oceanic peoples both early enough to have influenced Olmec culture and also as late as the medieval period of western history. Particu larly telling, I think, are ceramic shapes, urn burials, unique house types, mace forms and hafting techniques, and stone sarcophagi with links to Japan or a mainland source common to both; hairless dogs, art motifs, tripodal cylinder vessels, calendar, working of gemstones, and placing of jade in the mouths of the dead typical of China; splayed-figure and x-ray artistic conventions, head deformation, long flutes, age-graded societies and boys' initiations, blowguns, tower or pole diving, stiff armor and certain club forms, and pile dwellings shared with Pacific cultures; and</page><page sequence="82">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess -fr 365 certain plants, terracing, tooth filing, marimba, bark cloth, back-strap loom, ikat dying technique, wheeled toys, Hindu/ Buddhist art motifs and concepts, iconography and mythology, architectural characteristics, and thread crosses shared with Southeast Asia and Indonesia. Some of the Asiatic or Pacific traits may have been disseminated from one actual contact point to another by native coastal traders. Negative painted ceramics adopted by Mexican potters from Panamanian-Costa Rican prototypes, and vessels with basket handles and stirrup spouts that have origins in Peru are cases in point. Another is the copying by Moche potters around 750 ce of ceramic effigies of Mexican hairless dogs, a favorite subject of Colima potters going back to 250 bce, if not earlier.13! There was at least one actual intrusion of South Americans into western Mexico during the Late Postclassic, in the middle Balsas River where at a site near Arcelia, Guerrero, they erected adobe struc tures with trapezoidal Inca doorways. The new arrivals were probably the Tarascans, whose language is related to both Quechua and Aymara. With expansion of the Tarascan empire their speech spread from south of the Balsas to Lake Chapala.132 The Tarascans themselves informed their Spanish chronicler that the lineage of their cazonci (king) spoke a different language than earlier inhabitants and that the new language had been introduced three generations before the last cazonci was killed by the Spaniards in the 1520s.133 Certain cultural traits typical of the Tarascans suggest Andean ancestry: cloistered women, trophy heads, the splayed-figure motif, ceramic vessels with handles and stirrup spouts, mummy bundles of kings, and possibly the crossed-thread motif, although it may have been introduced directly from Asia. The last two traits were adopted by Huichols when they came into contact with the Tarascans in Michoacan. It was probably the seated position of the royal mummies that led to a change from flexed [apparently in sidelying] to seated burials in the later Postclassic in the Apatzingan area.134 In reviewing the developments in ceremonial architecture from the earliest centers in South America, dating as far back as about 3000 bce, up to Tarascan temples in use at the time of European contact, I uncovered a number of features that are key elements in the link I am proposing. Most important were circular temples atop mounds, temple observatories, sunken courts, wall niches, ritual reconstruction, and the geometry inherent in laying out sites. Arachnid and feline imagery, offerings of feather down, deer antlers, feathered sticks (pabos in the U.S. Southwest), and hallucinogenic drugs can be considered as part of</page><page sequence="83">366 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest the culture of the early colonizing Coastal Trekkers common to both North and South America. Northern Plains Cosmology, Village Plans, and Structures Moving into the northern Great Plains we find remarkable features in the seven permanent villages of the Skidi Pawnee, or Panismaha, which mirror their cosmology. The four villages at the center are conceived as a cross, oriented to the solstices [and surely representing the sun's annual passage], although they bear star names equated with directional colors, such as Black Star of the Northeast and Red Star of the Southeast. At opposite ends of an imaginary east-west axis are villages associated with Morning Star and his helper Sun, and with Evening Star and her helper Moon. These six villages are paired: northeast (male) with southwest (female), southeast (male) with northwest (female), and east and west with, respectively, Morning Star (male) and Evening Star (female). Thus, east is male and west is female. Some researchers have suggested that Mars or Jupiter are linked to the male principle as well. The dualism is quite explicit. The seventh village to the north is equated with Polaris. Its heavenly opposite is Canopus, which is not reflected in a village.135 The reason no village is placed to the south is explained in Pawnee mythology. The North Star is equated with the benevolent creator of this world. The Pawnee have an apocalyptic belief that this world will end when the North Star relinquishes his dominion to the South Star, his dark counterpart equated with the underworld. The stars will come to earth, [like the reversal of the magnetic poles apparently], people will become stars and "live in the place ruled by the South Star, which is their true home."136 The shrines in the four main villages pertain to the mundane world of hunting and planting; the shrines dedicated to the Morning Star and the Evening Star represent cosmic forces.137 The Pawnee semi-subterranean earth lodge, too, reflected the cosmos in theory if not always in practice. The circular shape was the womb of Mother Earth, the universe, and the nest of the eagle (Sun), while the tunneled ramp, oriented to the east [is the birth canal]. The roof is the dome of heaven, and the four posts supporting the sky, each often painted with the color appropriate to its directional spirit, also served as the conduits of power between mortals and gods. A central fire pit was</page><page sequence="84">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess &lt;r 367 viewed as the mouth of Tirawa, the First God. A low platform against the back (west) wall served as an altar. Upon it rested a bison skull and over it a medicine bundle was suspended, which had to be renewed annually. The altar was considered to be the throne of Tirawa and the garden of Evening Star, where corn and buffalo were constantly renewed. When Morning Star entered the tunnel-vagina [an event that could occur only at the equinox], he "lit" the fire in an act of cosmic procreation, symbolizing his first union with Evening Star that produced the first humans. As the sun crept across the floor it illuminated the altar. Thus the doorway, and the smokehole above the centrally located hearth as well, were sometimes used to observe the positions of the sun, stars, and constellations that determined the ceremonial calendar.138 Pawnee mythology clarifies the symbolism. Tirawa Atius, the Power Above, placed the gods in the sky, along with the deities for each of the quadrants of the universe, the moving stars, the Sun, and the Moon. He appointed Morning Star to rule over the lesser gods, and Morning Star and Evening Star were granted the power to give life to humans. Sun and Moon had the same ability, but were not as powerful. Moon was considered the mother of the stars, including Big Black Meteor Star (Algol or Capellar). who was goddess of magic and instructress of the first medicine men.139 Tirawa designated the center of the earth with an ash tree. Birds and animals swept the area [sanctifying it], and the gods of the four semi-cardinal directions brought four forked posts to form the center of the cosmic earth lodge.140 The first lodge was [apparently built for] Moon Lady. There the first human couple found four old men identified as Wind, Cloud, Lightning, and Thunder141—the four powers of the sky incorporated into the directional associations that we shall now examine. Although Pawnee lodges were oriented on an east-west axis, their four central villages were aligned, as noted, with the solstitial points. The associations made with the latter points are remarkably like those of the Hopi. Northwest was represented by yellow, lightning, mountain lion, and cottonwood; southwest with white, winds, wildcat, and box elder; southeast with red, clouds, wolf, and willow; northeast with black, thun der, bear, and elm.142 For the northwest direction the Pawnee and Hopi share yellow and mountain lion, for the southeast red and wolf. In the case of the northeast-southwest axis they reverse the symbolism: whereas the Pawnee recognize white and wildcat as southwest associations, these are northeast to the Hopi; and the Pawnee equations of black and bear for</page><page sequence="85">368 ■fr Journal of the Southwest the northeast, correspond for the Hopi with blue (interchangeable with black in other directional color schemes) and bear for the southwest. The two schemes differ in that the Pawnee use weather phenomena in place of birds, and trees instead of domestic plants. The apparent differences may be deceptive. It is likely that the Hopi substituted domesticates for trees only after becoming sedentary farmers. The directional weather associations of the Pawnee can be understood as manifestations of the Winged Beings, as we deduce from Oglala Sioux cosmology. North is the home of the great Thunder-being and wizard Waziya (from waziyata, "toward the pine"; wazi = pine), whose messenger bird is the magpie. [This hints at an earlier association of a different tree with each direction that perhaps has been forgotten.] Red and lightning are symbolic of north. Waziya's companion is West Wind, home of other Thunder-beings, and associated with black, thunder, and swallow as the messenger bird. Crow and meadowlark, the messenger birds of east and south, respectively, can be deduced as clouds and winds of the Pawnee system.143 I pause here to draw attention to the fact that that the four direc tional spirits manifested as weather phenomena in Pawnee cosmology are likewise found in the Zapotec belief system. In fact, the Zapotec consider themselves descended from clouds—hence they are the Cloud People—and they return to the clouds after death.144 The Hopi share the belief that the dead turn into clouds—in this case, in order to bring rain.145 This shared concept, along with strong mythic ties to the Sea Goddess and pilgrimages to her sites observed by the Huichol and Hopi, are compelling reasons to argue for close contact among these ethnic groups along the Pacific coast at some point. The ideas expressed in Pawnee village layout and lodge construction extended yet farther. Earth lodges of Mandan villages on the upper Missouri River were arranged in concentric circles around a plaza, in the center of which was planted a red-painted cedar post [note another evergreen] representing Lone Man, the survivor of the Great Flood and the creator god, surrounded by a wooden cylinder (called the "big canoe") built to symbolically protect the Mandan from the mythic flood. The village was divided into moieties along a north-south axis: Buffalo People to the west; Corn People to the east. The sacred okipa lodge was constructed directly on the line, with members of each moiety building its respective side. The western moiety placed small pieces of buffalo hide in the bottom of their postholes; the eastern moiety deposited yellow corn in theirs. And like others described, Mandan and Hidatsa lodges</page><page sequence="86">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess 369 were associated with women and fecundity, and the four supporting posts upheld the dome of heaven.146 Siouan-speaking tribes tended to divide their tipi circles in halves representing earth and sky. For example, in an 1872 Omaha camp the Sky People were located on the northern half; the Earth People on the southern. Other dualistic concepts are east as life, west as death, north as male, south as female. Winnebago villages were ordered into the same directional moieties with the same names as the Omaha. Clan names reflect the dichotomy. The four clans of the Sky People are Thunderbird, War People, Eagle, and Pigeon (extinct). The Earth People are represented by Bear, Wolf, Water Spirit, Deer, Elk, Buffalo, Fish, and Snake clans. Thunderbird and Bear are the leading clans. The lodge of the former was the locus of the peace lodge; that of the latter was charged with discipline. The Earth moiety maintained a sweat lodge in the form of a bear, the clan's mythic ancestor, in which worshipers were "drawn into the protection of the animal's heat and power."147 The hide tipi of the Plains Indians shares the same general arrange ment and symbolism as the Huichol tuki, the Pueblo kiva, and the Pawnee earth lodge. The Oglala tipi is typical. It is circular and carries that form's multiple layers of meaning: womb, universe, and nest. (The Oglala have a myth concerning the Thunderbird living in a lodge while a baby Thunderbird in an egg incubates in a nest in a tree.148) When one steps through the small east-facing opening, one reenters the womb of Earth Mother. The hearth is centrally located beneath the smokehole, so that the smoke carries the prayers directly to Wakan Tanka, the great mystery. To the west of the hearth is the square altar where sweetgrass, sage, or cedar incense is burned and against which the medicine pipe is inclined, stem up, during ceremonies (the stem is masculine-sky, the bowl female-earth). The poles are the link between heaven and earth. The owner's place is against the west wall behind the altar. Men gener ally sit on the north side, women on the south. The etiquette of the tipi calls for men to move to the right of the door to reach their designated seats, women to the left, passing behind those already seated and never between the host and the altar without permission. Both the sacred nature of the tipi and its antiquity are evident from Asiatic parallels. In 2000 I was able to visit the impoverished camp of a family of Tsataam, a reindeer- herding minority found in northern Mongolia adjacent to the Siberian border. The camp was located above the timberline west of Lake Havsgol where only the mother and father</page><page sequence="87">370 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest (both shamans) and two younger children were spending the summer. The tipi (covered with a tattered and soiled piece of canvas) was in almost every way like those of our Plains Indians, except for its orientation which was identical to that of the felt-covered gers of the Mongolian steppe nomads: the opening was to the south, the north side was reserved for an altar where family photographs and other treasures were displayed, and the sacred hearth was at the center. Our limited time there and the demands made upon our interpreter by the group I was traveling with prohibited me from asking the many questions that swirled in my brain, but I did manage to extract a (partial?) answer to my inquiry about whether the poles of the structure served as conduits for communicating with the spirits, as they do in some parts of the Far East. The response of the shamaness was that she did, indeed, communicate with spirits, but did so by sitting in the sacred northern area of the tent rather than using the poles. Communication, she volunteered, was most active at times of the year when the earth was quickening with life or dying with the approach of winter. To return to the Pawnee, two ceremonies demonstrate their link to both the Oglala myth of the Thunderbird and to Mexican ritual. A ceremony they share with the Huichol is one held for the well-being of children. Again, the lodge serves as a sundial, the climax of the ceremony coinciding with the sun passing directly over the smokehole and hearth. Part of the rite involves the priest drawing a circle with his toe and placing eagle down inside it [in imitation of the Thunderbird making a nest for the egg containing the baby Thunderbird].149 The Pawnee rite of the Morning Star offers other proof of their contact with central Mexico. It is a reenactment of a myth in which Evening Star was sent to hinder the creative powers of Morning Star [the old antagonism of Moon and Sun], although eventually as she lay dying after being shot with magic arrows, she bestowed great blessings [apparently bison and corn]. The Morning Star rite was held every four years and began when a young captive woman [representing Evening Star] was treated kindly for some time, so that she would carry favorable messages to the gods. On the given day she was stripped, her body was painted half red and half black [Black Star of the Northeast and Red Star of the Southeast; east is male], tied to a scaffold, and shot with arrows by young warriors.150 Spilling her blood (an analogue for water), assured a continuing supply of buffalo and crops. Her black and red body paints link her to the Nahua Dual Lord and Lady: he, clothed in red, representing day, she, in black, representing</page><page sequence="88">Circular Temples and the Moon Goddess ■&gt; 371 night. The sacrifice by arrows links her to the Venus cult of Mexico. Red and black, indicative of dualism, is found in eastern Asia and Melanesia and may have been introduced by the Coastal Trekkers. Anthropomorphic figures painted half red and half black are prominent pictographs left by prehistoric hunter-gathers in Baja California and Nayarit. Summary This section has extended the range of cosmogonic traits reflected in architecture northward into the heart of North America. My organization of the data is not meant to imply a South American origin for all the ele ments covered. Circular or polygonal houses and temples with embedded symbols of both a creatress (full moon, spiderweb, womb, or place of emergence into the present world) and of a multilayered vertical universe [the Cosmic Egg] are beliefs shared by all people. Two examples from farther afield will illustrate. Bering Sea Inuit equated their sod huts with the womb and the moon. A "journey to the moon" was a euphemism for sexual intercourse. They believed that the spirit-keepers of land animals dwelt in the moon and the animals were released through an opening in it. To encourage the spirits to release their charges, a door was cut into the side of the women's house in the spring in preparation for a new hunting season.151 Another example is the Kwakiutl winter house, which serves as both dwelling and temple. It is built with a semi-subterranean, rectangular pit at its center to represent the underworld. The surround ing house floor and walls are equated with the middle world. An axial ladder made from the heart of the cedar (equated with blood) is planted at the center of the pit and reaches beyond the smokehole, thus bridging the three worlds [the World Tree]. Erected during the winter-season ceremonies, it is climbed by shamans during "dramatic performances." Trees used in the construction of these houses are ritually "killed" and offerings are made to appease the spirits of the trees [Moon Goddess who owns the trees]. House posts and facades are embellished with heraldic motifs. The entry to a house described in 1914 was emphasized with a painted circle identified as a rainbow incorporating a mythic being with two mouths. In another example the painted circle around the door represented the moon. Passage through the entrance symbolized death (associated with black) and rebirth (associated with red).152 The concepts of dualism, a quincuncial plan of the earth, and recogni</page><page sequence="89">372 Journal of the Southwest tion of asterisms are not unique to earlier or later colonizers either. They, too, derive from a shared Paleolithic origin. These are all traits which, because of their universality, have to be extrapolated from archaeological evidence and mythologies of preliterate cultures. What I have tried to delineate are the various avatars of a creatress—arachnid feline, ophian or saurian—that would have been introduced by the Coastal Trekkers from the Old World, presumably at an earlier date than the introduction of ungulate avatars more typical of the Inland Trekkers from Siberia. Only pre-Columbian pictographs, petroglyphs, a few artifacts, and ves tiges of the worldviews of a handful of ethnic groups little influenced by the rising civilizations have left clues of the cosmological beliefs of the colonizers of the Americas before they began constructing monu mental architecture. The use of geometric canons of proportion in the planning of temples and large ceremonial complexes is, of course, a later development that, based on their earlier dates, began in South America. Whether the technique developed independently of its Old World use cannot be determined with current data. Application of the system to relatively late monumental building efforts in Mesoamerica and Mexico, which emphasized the Cosmic Cross, and the construction artisans of Mexico are the themes of the next section. "!■</page><page sequence="90">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico In the beginning there was but one being in the lower world, Sus-sistinnako, a spider. At that time there were no other animals, birds, reptiles, or any living creature but the spider. He drew a line of meal from north to south and crossed it midway from east to west; and he placed two little parcels north of the cross line, one on either side of the line running north and south. These parcels were very valuable and precious [they contained the seed of the twin mothers of humankind and all their creatures], but the people do not know to this day of what they consisted; no one ever knew but the creator, Sus-sistinnako. After placing the parcels in posi tion, Sus-sistinnako sat down on the west side of the line running north and south of the cross line, and began to sing, and in a little while the two parcels accompanied him in the song by shaking like rattles. The music was low and sweet, and after a while two women appeared, one evolved from each parcel; and in a short time people began walking about; then animals and birds, and all other animate objects appeared, and Sus-sistinnako continued to sing until his creation was complete. —Tyler, Pueblo Gods and Myths, 91-92 Earlier we found the concept of the Cosmic Cross incorporated into the small cruciform chamber at Chavin de Huantar known as the Lanzon. There it is associated with a colossal figure—part human, part jaguar, and part snake. Additionally the symbol appears on a small mortar carved as a jaguar (recall the association'of felines with agriculture) and in the previous section we found the cross associated with the Moon Goddess in her avatar as Spider Grandmother (figure 24). Before examining sites in Mexico where the design principle of the Cosmic Cross was wedded to geometric perfection it is worth citing other examples of the symbol. Its earliest association with the female principle may be a small clay figure of the goddess with the symbol painted on her legs, which was uncovered at Catal Hiiyiik, an Anatolian site dating to 5600-4600 bce.153 A cross enclosed within a circle became the Egyptian hieroglyph for a town, and Neolithic cities from the Mediterranean to India were laid out according</page><page sequence="91">374 4" Journal of the Southwest to this plan.154 The same symbol appears on a Chinese bronze mirror dating from the Tang dynasty (618-906 ce). The Cross contains in its arms animals representing the cardinal directions: an entwined turtle and snake [north], phoenix [south], tiger [west, realm of the Moon Goddess], and dragon [east, realm of the Sun God].155 In Olmec art the Cosmic Cross represents a deity and is often found in association with a feline.156 In Yucatecan it is known as the kan, and in Cholan as chan, both words meaning "sky," "snake," and "four." [Recall the celestial sea as snake and the directional snakes or dragons of Chinese mythology.157] It is intriguing, therefore, to find that in Mandarin the cross is called kun and in Cantonese, tea#.158 The cross was a popular motif on painted effigy pots produced in the Recuay culture of Peru.159 It is still painted on contemporary pottery from lowland South America. A double-lined cross within a circle appears on a Monte Alban I (ca. 500 bce) vessel from Oaxaca. The arms of the cross seem to be equated with the "lesser lightning" (clouds, rain, hail, wind), represented as liz ards, that were companions of Cocijo (Lightning), the most powerful force in Zapotec belief (compare the Pawnee equivalent in the previous section).160 During the Monte Alban I period (500-300 bce), Zapotecs began constructing what appear to have been sacrificial platforms, some in the form of the Cosmic Cross. In the ensuing period (Monte Alban II) some elites were being laid to rest in a cruciform tomb with a burial chamber accessed via a staircase leading to an antechamber and with niches to the sides and rear. On the outskirts of Monte Alban's main plaza, a residential house having four rooms surrounding a patio to form a cross was discovered. Beneath the floor of the north room were burials in slab-lined tombs [north being realm of the dead].161 In central Mexico Cocijo's equivalent was Xiutecutli or Huehueteotl, God of Fire associated with the east [remember fire as the earthly sun]. A ceramic figure from Cerro de los Mesas depicts this god with a headdress featuring the Cosmic Cross to denote his position at the center of the world.162 A polychrome clay female figurine with red Cosmic Crosses painted on her cheeks, found in Veracruz and identified as Classic period, is displayed at the Rufino Tamayo Museum in Oaxaca City. The Cosmic Cross, a popular motif on artifacts produced by Hopewell, Adena, and Mississippian cultures, was obviously central to their beliefs. In addition to the gorget depicted in figure 24, others have been found in which the creatress is represented in the center by a Cosmic Cross sym bolizing the vital life force, with other avatars of her, such as directional</page><page sequence="92">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico 375 felines, rattlesnakes, and pileated woodpeckers shown, as whirlwinds or swastikas. Birds are particularly appropriate because all people equated the breath of life with wind and birds. A Zuni observation provides an explanation of how they drew the analogy: "the whirlwind flies aloft and circles widely in the sky; therefore he is endowed with the wings and tail, the head, beak, and talons of an eagle."163 The Cosmic Cross was, and still is, a dominant design element in Mayan civilization. Although the concept behind it is as old as human kind, its manifestation in architecture appears to have coincided with the appearance of the concept of kingship (250 bce-250 ce). According to Bishop Landa, piles of stones placed in the four directions formed the entry to "all the towns in Yucatan." Lancandon Indians still retain this idea in four trails from their towns to the cardinal points. Present Mayas recognize four Yum Balamob (Fathers of Jaguars) that guard the four entrances to their settlements.164 Mayas equated the Tree of Life with the god Chac-Xib-Chac (Baby Jaguar, Venus as Evening Star). Some New World mythologies describe all life issuing from the tree and spirits of the dead, especially children, returning to the tree to await rebirth. The dead were placed in trees in a broad band stretching from the northwest coast of North America to Delaware in the same belief. In Mayan ritual and iconography, the Tree of Life (Yaxche or ceiba) marked the entrance to the underworld. At its roots lies the origin of the four sacred rivers that divide the world into quadrants (see the introduction). The same concern for directional orientation, as well as tree and jag uar symbolism, is incorporated into a Late Preclassic (250 bce-250 ce) Maya temple built at Cerros in the Yucatan Peninsula. The foundation was prepared by laying down several layers of white earth mixed with offerings of tree flowers and ceramic sherds of both local and foreign manufacture, which had likely been smashed following a ritual feast. A pavement of stones set into this foundation formed the surface upon which a platform with stairway was erected. A grid of internal walls within the platform kept the rubble fill from spreading [a technique noted earlier for Sacsahuaman], thus stabilizing the platform, the top of which was surfaced with more limed earth mixed with potsherds. Atop it a steep pyramid, built of loaf-shaped blocks, was accessed by a north-south aligned staircase. Four deep holes at the summit supported directional trees that delineated the temple and may have stood above the height of the temple's thatched roof. The stairway had four steps leading to a landing, plus an additional nine to the summit. [The break in the steps</page><page sequence="93">376 Journal of the Southwest at the landing suggests the four worlds destroyed before this one—in other words, the underworld—and nine levels of heaven. In Buddhist cosmology both nine and thirteen heavenly levels are identified.] Four decorative panels of carved and painted plaster (employing red, pink, black, and yellow pigments) flanked the stairs. The lower panels featured masks of snarling jaguars emerging from the heads of long-nosed mon sters. Four-petaled glyphs on the cheeks of the jaguars identify them as the jaguar sun god in its rising (east, right) and setting (west, left) positions. The upper panels featured masks representing Morning Star (right) and Evening Star (left). The four images are interpreted as the ancestral twins from the Popul Vuh.165 Quite apart from their aforementioned South American associa tion with the ancestral twins, felines serve as guardians of the sacred mountain-temple—or the Mother Goddess herself. Another Preclassic Maya example is at the site of Uaxactun, where the Witz Monster is combined with the Vision Serpent to produce three horizontal zones incorporating the primordial sea, represented by waves and fishes; the earth, represented by leaf forms; and the Vision Serpent as the bridge between the cosmic layers.166 The Witz (Mountain) Monster is a fearsome guardian beast. Cave openings into Mother Earth were identified as its mouth, the entry into the underworld. The Vision Serpent, produced through bloodletting practices, bridged the earth and the underworld, allowing communication with the ancestors. Mayas constructed their temples for several, although not neces sarily mutually exclusive, purposes. The earliest pertain to egalitarian societies showing no, or minimal, social stratification and were certainly constructed as abodes for the gods. With the emergence of a hierarchi cal social structure and growing disparity of wealth, the elite claimed descent from the gods themselves and those at the top proclaimed their own divinity. Former abodes for the gods came to be the abodes for god-kings, just as they had become in the Old World. By the Late Pre classic, kings at Cerros and Tikal were laid to rest in tombs built at the summits of pyramids, although the practice was not common until the Classic period.167 On the other hand, some nobles chose the underworld as their burial home. Pacal, a mid-seventh-century ce king of Palenque who was a notable builder, had the Temple of Inscriptions constructed to mark his tomb. The tomb was excavated as a pit below grade prior to the creation of a great nine-terraced pyramid above it. The tomb with its stone sarcophagus was linked to the temple above by a spirit tube to</page><page sequence="94">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico -fr 377 provide a path for the Vision Serpent (spirit of the king) to follow when called upon by his descendants. Another example is the burial chamber for a noblewoman cut into the living rock under the central axis of a structure known as 5 G-8 at Tikal.168 Many temples were built or rebuilt for religious reasons, a practice that dates back to Preceramic times in South America when the Nanchoc mound was capped with stone slabs and abandoned in what is called a termination ritual. From that point on temples were rebuilt on a regular basis according to some ritual calendar. Others were rebuilt to terminate a bad cycle and start anew. An excellent example is found at Tikal. One event of the Late Classic Venus (or Shell-Star) Wars was Caracol's defeat of Tikal in 556. Caracol insolently proclaimed its victory by erecting a stele set in the middle of the ball court. Several generations later Tikal was rebuilt under the king Ah-Cacaw. Significant to our concern is that the broken and desecrated tree-stones or stelae of old, which were inscribed with the names of four kings, were carefully gathered up and buried within the new pyramid-temple. Buried with them were shells, coral, seaweed, and sponges, as well as finely knapped flints [thunderbolts]. Those in attendance added their offerings, which were smashed and ground, and all were quickened by bloodletting by the lords and shamans.169 In this act of interment a cycle was terminated and a new one initiated. Offer ings were reduced to powder, just as the bones of mythical deities had been ground into meal and cast into the primeval water for rebirth [river as vagina of the Mother Goddess], Rituals repeated over time in such places or using sacred paraphernalia, such as medicine pipes, concentrate spiritual energy at the site or in that object, making them more sacred over time. Additionally, the premier lesson to be learned from the study of ancient sacred architecture is that the construction or reconstruction of any kind of building deemed sacred—be it temple, king's palace, or priest's house—was a symbolic act of re-creating the world and required a human sacrifice representing the Creator god who by one means or another died in order to bring forth life. By the Terminal Classic period, beginning about the ninth century, many of the old kingdoms from Palenque to Copan were crashing, while states across the Yucatan peninsula and the northern lowlands were flour ishing.170 In the latter area new construction techniques developed that used concrete wall cores veneered with block masonry. Multi-roomed buildings atop the pyramids were embellished with mosaic facades and wall carvings, replacing the stelae and written records of earlier kings.</page><page sequence="95">378 ■4" Journal of the Southwest New outside influences were manifested in the monumental buildings of new cities rising in the Puuc hills of the northwestern sector of the peninsula. The strongest city-state to emerge was Chichen Itza, which by the eleventh century was unparalleled and remained the unchallenged ruler of the northern Maya for several centuries. It was unique in being ruled by a council of lords rather than kings.171 The next sacred abode we shall examine is one erected at the site. The Temple of Kukulcan (otherwise known as the Castillo) is noted for its western staircase featuring snake heads at the base. At sunset during the equinoxes the feathered serpent himself appears to undulate down the stairs. There is far more going on here, however, than the semi-annual dramatic appearance of Kukulcan. Figure 27 demonstrates the harmonic integration of sacred geometry with the structure. The building is laid out according to the eight-pointed star. In Sumeria it was the symbol for Venus. Kukulcan was equated with Venus and the so-called five-pointed Venus star is actually half an eight-pointed one. Visually more obvious is the Cosmic Cross formed by the staircases, with the temple at its center symbolizing the sacred mountain or sacred ceiba tree, the axis mundi. The nine terraces are the nine levels of the heavens, so cosmic space is transcended as one climbs to the top. Each staircase has 91 steps, total ing 364 and they share one common final step to account for the days of the year,172 so one transcends time as well.173 Although the Cosmic Cross is evident in individual temples such as Kukulcan at Chichen Itza, the plan is not carried out at the level of town planning, as it was by the theocracy of India's Mauryan Dynasty. Chichen Itza's Great Plaza found its inspiration in the old plaza of Tula. At the time the Temple of Kulkulcan was added, however, its orientation was changed by a little more than 90 degrees, and later structures followed the new alignment.174 Important buildings were aligned primarily to track Venus. The round Caracol was an observatory with solar alignments for the solstice, equinox, and zenith passage, but most important was its capability of observing the last appearance of Venus on the western horizon, which was important for predicting its presumed heliacal rising eight days later. Its heliacal rising was considered an unlucky omen and was tied to ritual warfare associated with the god. The Temple of Venus at Copan has a Venus-facing window aligned with all the great northerly extremes occurring at eight-year intervals between 700 and 900 ce dur ing April and May at the onset of the rainy season in that area. Anthony Aveni found that a seven-kilometer baseline established along an east</page><page sequence="96">Figure 27. Mayan Temple of Kulculcan (also known as the Castillo), Chichen Itzd, Yucatan. Side view and plan demonstrating how the temple was laid out in accordance with the eight-pointed star, the symbol of Venus.</page><page sequence="97">380 Journal of the Southwest west axis between two stelae and perpendicular to the ceremonial center was aligned to sunset on April 12, which signaled the time to burn the last harvest's stubble off the fields to prepare for the planting season. Copan may actually have been deliberately established as a ceremonial center because of its latitude, where the sun spends 260 days south of the celestial zenith and 105 north of the line. Supporting this, the sight line also began the divisions of the calendar incorporating the tropical year and a unique cycle of260 days using a sequence of thirteen numbers and twenty day names.175 Evidence exists that ceremonial centers did attempt an orderly arrangement. A case in point is Uxmal, where most structures are oriented 9 degrees east of north. But the Palace of the Governors is skewed 20 degrees from the axis in order that its central doorway would line up with the ceremonial center of Nohpat six kilo meters away and with the extreme rising position of Venus during the period of its occupation. Another example of Maya observations of the heavens is Building E-VII at Uaxactun, which served as an observatory in conjunction with three buildings on a platform to the east. From the observation point of Building E-VII, sunrise on June 21 (summer solstice) appeared at the far left corner of the platform upon which the three structures stood. Sunrise on September 21 (autumnal equinox) appeared directly over the center edifice, and sunrise on December 21 (winter solstice) was seen at the far right corner of the platform This setup was widely copied at a number of other sites in the Peten. Such observations appear to have been made with the help of crossed sticks used as a foresight, judging from an illustration in the Mixtec Codex Bodley (ca. 1520 ce). It appears to depict a priest-astronomer sighting across it as he sits in his observatory-temple, which is identified by star glyphs.176 There were close ties between the Maya culture and the Totonac of the Gulf coast. The Pyramid of the Niches (sixth-seventh centuries ce) is another example of beautiful symmetry wedded to cosmic view (figure 28). The eight-pointed star is hidden in the design. In this case, time is embedded in 365 niches rather than steps. Each side of the stairs is flanked by a ramp with a fret-like motif interpreted as an abstract serpent or human vertebrae. The temple at the summit had five carved panels per side, above which were friezes representing the sky. The principal facade is oriented 4 degrees north of east. This Tajm style of architecture is distinct to the area. The niches and deep cornices provide a dramatic chiaroscuro effect to the building. The niches were invariably painted</page><page sequence="98">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico 4- 381 red with blue frames. The stairs were added as if by afterthought: niches and cornices run under stairways and niches are set into some of them. Stone facings were coated with stucco and painted. Zoomorphic motifs on the building include coyote, jaguar, and snake. Dressed stone lintels for doors and windows have holes drilled in them for curtain rods. The Building of the Columns at El Tajin features panels forming Cosmic Cross-shaped niches and a portico of six columns on the terrace in front, each made up of multiple drums carved with names and dates, warriors and priests, and scenes of daily life or ritual. The flat roofs of the build ings were made by pouring from three to nine layers of concrete over a ceiling of wood. The concrete was made of lime from seashells mixed with sand, fragments of pumice, bits of wood and fiber, and potsherds.177 The unique architectural style of Tajin has some parallels with Khmer architecture. For example, the fenestration of the Temple of the Niches is remarkably like the Temple of Phimeanakas.178 The Teotihuacanos and the great city they established at Teotihuacan ("Place of the Gods," so named by the Aztecs) in the central highlands of Mexico were regarded by subsequent generations of Mexicans as the golden age. They began building the city about the beginning of the Christian era. At the apex of development around 500 ce it had a popula tion estimated between 125,000 and 200,000, a size comparable to that of London a millennium later. It became the hub of a vast trade network attracting merchants and craft specialists from Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Maya lands. The city of eight square miles was laid out as a rectangular grid following a main north-south boulevard beginning with the Temple of the Moon at the north end and the Temple of Quetzalcoatl at the southern end. The street was aligned to a slope of the sacred mountain Cerro Gordo three kilometers away. An intersecting east-west axis was established from a point near the Pyramid of the Sun to another on the western horizon. The latter point marked the setting of the Pleiades around May 18 at a time when the sun passes directly overhead and coincides with the first annual predawn appearance of the asterism. It also marked the setting of the sun on August 12 on the anniversary of the beginning of the last great Mesoamerican calendar cycle, which according to some scholars began in 3114 bce.179 Of more than passing interest is the fact that these and other alignment points are marked with Cosmic Crosses. The main boulevard is actually skewed 10V2 degrees east of true north. The orientation toward the setting point of the Pleiades became the model for other sites all over the Valley of Mexico. Given</page><page sequence="99">0M*m sy«17 *5/^7 Figure 28. Totonac Temple of the Niches, Gulf coast. Side view and plan demonstrating how the temple was laid out in accordance with the eight-pointed star, the symbol of Venus.</page><page sequence="100">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico -S" 383 these clues we can deduce that the plan of the city was based upon the Cosmic Cross as a reflection of the celestial realm. A point to be noted concerning the north-south axis is that two mountains, the mountain-pyramid of the Temple of the Moon at one end and the sacred mountain of Cerro Gordo at the other, define the Teotihuacanos' world under the guardianship of the Moon Goddess and her son/consort Quetzalcoatl. She was the premier guardian of the underworld, which in Aztec cosmology was located in the north. The Aztec symbol of the south was the rabbit, Rabbit being simply one animal form of Quetzalcoatl.180 Aztec cosmology clarifies the orientation. As noted in the introduction, one role of the Moon Goddess was Guardian of the Underworld and Aztecs, like many other people, located it in the north. The direction was symbolized by a flint knife as a metaphor for a barren, icy region, hunger, and cold. The rabbit's association with the moon can be traced to an African origin myth explaining why people have to die. The rabbit was equated with grain agriculture in many Eurasian cultures, and the Chinese saw the lagomorph in the moon pounding the elixir of immortality. Two New World examples show the same con nection: the rabbit in the moon is depicted on a stone sculpture from Oaxaca and in another from the sixteenth-century Florentine Codex.181 In Aztec mythology the moon, under the name Mayahuel, was goddess of the marvelous intoxicants and she was the consort of Ehecatl, the wind (breath of life) aspect of Quetzalcoatl who, under the name Patecatl, was likewise linked to mind-altering beverages. The rabbit as a symbol of the god also stems from an Aztec origin myth in which he became the Fifth Sun by throwing himself into a fire. An analogous story from India recounts how the historic Buddha in a previous incarnation as a hare likewise sacrificed himself. Another consideration is the quantity of statuettes of the goddess and the storm god Tlaloc found throughout the city.182 Black Tlaloc with his fanged mouth is the storm aspect of Quetzalcoatl. The fanged mouth is but a not-so-subtle reminder of the god's jaguar form as the bringer of rain. The great platform compound, which Spaniards dubbed La Ciudadela (The Citadel), was completed about 250 ce. The complex was dominated by the temple dedicated to Quetzalcoatl (figure 29). The discovery in the 1980s of 133 human sacrifices, both male and female, attests to the importance of the structure. Significantly, they were found in various locations in and around the site in groups of4,8,9,18,or20, numbers which figure in the Mesoamerican calendar and cosmology.183 Figures 29</page><page sequence="101">384 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest Figure 29. Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuaean, Mexieo. Analysis of the site based upon the eight-pointed star. and 30, analyzing the layout of the entire compound by use of the eight pointed star and doubling of the square, demonstrate the builders' con cern for harmonic proportions. Figure 31 analyzes the compound using the basic circle of the temple platform and its inscribing square.184 The enormous Pyramid of the Sun was erected between the temples of the Moon and Quetzalcoatl along the main street. Could its construc tion signal a change from a lunar to a solar calendar? Of considerable interest is that it was built over a cave, suggesting that it was the place of emergence from the previous four worlds (or suns) known from Aztec cosmology. What better symbolism could the Teotihuacanos have contrived than building a temple dedicated to the Sun directly over the place of emergence, since this is the fifth sun in the sequence (see figure</page><page sequence="102">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico v 385 Figure 30. Temple of Quetzaleoatl at Teotihuacan. Analysis of the site based upon doubling the square. 7). Figures 32 and 33 show the relationship of the parts to the whole and reflect the concern for order so typical of the city. Teotihuacan collapsed about 750 ce, and new cities emerged at Cholula and Tula. The last city was destroyed in 1165, probably by the Mexica (Aztecs), whose tradition relates that they arrived there at that time after years of peregrination. Eventually their wanderings ended in 1325 at Lake Texcoco, where they founded their city of Tenochtitlan. Throughout their peregrinations these wild Chichimecos had absorbed numerous ideas from more advanced sedentary cultures and had incor porated them into their own cosmology, among them urban planning based upon the Cosmic Cross. Upon an island in the lake they built their city, with a huge walled ceremonial complex encompassing seventy-eight structures at its center, and four gates and causeways dividing the city</page><page sequence="103">386 Journal of the Southwest Figure 31.

Although Spanish chroniclers left some excellent descriptions of the appearance of the city before so much was destroyed and overbuilt, more might have been described if the conquerors had not been so hasty in their zeal to eradicate all vestiges of the native religion. An example is the Great Temple, which archaeologists began excavating systematically in 1978. Like all such great pyramids, it was repeatedly enlarged over time. Seven construction phases were identified: five involving all four sides, two involving alterations only to the western-facing facade. The pyramid was topped with two temples: the northern one dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc, who although present in each of the four directions, was</page><page sequence="104">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico ■&gt; 387 Figure 32.

The first is that the temples represent two hills: one Tonacatepetl, the Hill of Sustenance (where maize was discovered by Quetzalcoatl) associated with Tlaloc; and the other Coatepec, Serpent Hill where Huitzilopochtli decapitated his sister, the moon goddess Coyolxauqui, and rolled her body down the hill causing its dismemberment.

And at the same stage sculptured serpents were placed around the platform, suggesting its identity as Serpent Hill. Thus the temple represented the Aztec's "most fundamental economic concerns: agriculture and tribute"—water being requisite for agricultural productivity and tribute being acquired through conquest.186 It is an excellent example of the manipulation of mythology for state propaganda.</page><page sequence="106">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico 389 The cardinal directions and their associated deities were realized in part in the great ceremonial complex. In front of the Great Temple was one dedicated to Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, whose direction was west, opposing Tlaloc who, as noted, was generally associated with the east. Several offer tory caches were uncovered during the excavation. Prominent among the artifactcfs were images of the Old Fire God (Xiuhtecuhtli, Huehueteotl, or Ometeotl). It is fitting that he should be represented within the pyramid, even if hidden from view, because he was the initial creator: Mother and Father of the Gods, Lord of Fire and of Time, and Lord of Turquoise (numerous green-stone artifacts in the caches reflect this identification). It was he who produced the four sons as cosmic forces associated with the cardinal directions while he represented the center, or axis mundi.187 Also prominent among the artifacts were images of Tlaloc and hundreds of marine shells. This, too, is in keeping with Aztec, indeed pre-Aztec, origin myths, because Tlaloc was the storm aspect of Quetzalcoatl and he was the son of the Moon and Sea Goddess, as noted. Before leaving the subject of the Cosmic Cross as an organizing prin ciple, I should mention its presence as a structure at Paquime (popularly, Casas Grandes) in the state of Chihuahua. It is the site of a sizeable town built of pise adobe which between 1210 and 1261 ce thrived as a major link in a trade network between the Pueblo area of the Southwest and central Mexico. In the city is an earthwork built in the form of an equal armed cross aligned to the cardinal directions with small circular mounds opposite each point. Apparently no archaeoastronomy has been done on the structure, but its excavator noted the alignment with the equinoxes and considered it a Venus symbol. His conclusion is consistent with my analyses of figures 27 and 28. Within the labyrinthine walls of the town there is also a small room in the form of the Cosmic Cross known as the House of the Skulls. In it were found three human skulls, which had been suspended from the ceiling, and hundreds of skulls of sacrificed turkeys. Since turkeys were sun symbols, it can be deduced that this was a temple dedicated to the Sun. Mexico's Building Artisans To Teotihuacanos of the golden age, Quetzalcoatl, the great Feathered Serpent himself, as the bestower of culture, was the divine artificer. With the assistance of his dwarf and hunchbacked craftsmen he built a stone</page><page sequence="107">390 -s" Journal of the Southwest ball court and an underground house, and erected a phallic stone. When he reached the coast he fashioned a boat in serpent form.188 Quetzal coad's disfigured helpers are another link to the Old World, where smith gods were typically lame. Another role of the Mexican god was patron of travelers, especially the pochtecas, itinerant merchants who may have been responsible for disseminating his cult to the Maya. Like the great city-states of South America, Maya kingdoms also produced great engineers and architects. In addition to the spectacular pyramid-temples and ceremonial plazas, they built raised fields for agri culture, canals, terraces, dams, reservoirs, causeways, and bridges. Some of the achievements probably had their inspiration in South American innovations. Suspension bridges built by the Olmec are among the traits considered to be of South American importation. Raised agricultural fields used by the Mayas is surely another. For instance, manmade earthen ridges covering more than 1,400 square miles in the San Jorge River district of Colombia, an area of seasonal flooding, were thought to have been made by residents who left behind a shell midden from which a radiocarbon date of 3090 bce was obtained. The ridges, apparently raised fields for growing food plants, were laid out in checkerboard fashion or in long parallels bearing no apparent orientation to riverbanks.189 One example of Mayan engineering is at Dzibilchaltun, where a causeway built of stone blocks covered with gravel and capped with cement was sixty feet wide and as high as eight feet in some places.190 Another is ruins found on the shore of the Usumacinta River, which have been identified as the abutments and carved-stone devices for a three-span suspension bridge leading to Yaxchilan.191 Maya cities were arranged hierarchically: temples and plazas were situated at the center and surrounding them were residences of the lords and priests. Beyond them lived the most important and richest citizens, and on the outskirts were the houses of the lower class.192 Like the Incas, Mayas had family lines of masons, architects, painters, and sculptors,193 but so far there is no evidence of guilds in either. One interesting insight into building practices was found in a temple at Cer ros. Workmen who had labored on the structure threw offerings of net weights, milling stones, and household objects into the foundation.194 Inscribed lines on the floor of a building at Preclassic El Mirador may have been "builders' marks."195 Archaeologists at Tikal uncovered the outline of a temple inscribed on a plaster foundation.196 Perhaps it was standard practice for architects to draw their designs in plaster as an</page><page sequence="108">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico 391 on-site blueprint. This is a practice used into our own period. I have seen the plan for a relatively modern church built in the state of Sonora, Mexico, inscribed on the wall of a building probably used as a workshop during construction. Tarascan artisans were controlled by a hierarchy directly responsible to their king that sounds mighty like a guild system. They certainly were organized along lines more structured than kin groups of special ists. During the sixteenth century the Spanish chronicler of the culture reported numerous supervisors under the king. One was "in charge of more than 2,000 officials whose work was building houses, with another thousand for the renovation of the temples they constructed. Often they did nothing but build houses and temples ordered by the Cazonci [king]." "One called cacari was the principal supervisor of all stone masons and quarries." "The one who was in charge of all the forest guards, of those that cut wood beams, and made boards and other lumber from the forest was called Pucuricuari." "There was a chief canoe maker called Hicharuta Vandari, along with a chief boatman called Paricuti to whom people were assigned as rowers." Such officers, and those of other trade specialists, were inherited, the position passing to son or brother.197 Aztec building artisans were drawn from the macehualtin, or com mon folk, rather than from the ranks of lords and nobles, the pipiltin. The labor force for monumental projects was provided by the corvee drawn from the calpultin, the four barrios of Tenochtitlan, as part of their tribute to the leader. Artisans appear to have been organized into a full-blown guild system. Fray Sahagun noted that the craftsman was "first an apprentice, and later a master of many offices" and thus matriculated it could be said he was omnis homo.l9s The patroness of "craftsmen who imitated nature" was the goddess Xochiquetzal. She was honored with the Feast of Flowers (Xochilhuitl). The skin of her sacrificial surrogate was donned by a craftsman who pretended to weave [revealing that the Moon Goddess was known under this name as the weaver] while oth ers, disguised as monkeys, ocelots, dogs, coyotes, mountain lions, and jaguars danced. Each dancer carried the insignia of his craft, such as the metal worker his tools.199 What other crafts these covered is open to speculation. Nor do we know whether Xochiquetzal was patroness of every trade. We do know, however, what techniques were used by those in the building trade and what was expected of the artisans, because these were carefully recorded by Fray Sahagun.</page><page sequence="109">392 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest The carpenter—the woodcutter, the axe-wielder, the feller of trees, splitter of [wood], chopper [of wood], topper [of trees]; the cut ter, the trimmer of branches, the user of the wedge.

Carpenters at work. (Redrawn from Sahagun, Florentine Codex. Book 10, The People) corners.203 Completion of the project was celebrated by feasting, danc ing, and pouring pulque on the corners. Then the host took a newly lit firebrand and pointed it in each direction by way of taking possession.204 These building rituals are consistent with Old World ones. Additional insight into indigenous building practices comes from far ther afield. When a major house was to be constructed on the American northwest coast the host-builder invited representatives from subtribes to a feast. Gifts of blankets were made to the men selected to provide the two cedar trees for the main beams. Others were selected to produce additional elements, which were to be roughed out to the required sizes. When these were ready, a crew spent four days assembling all the required materials. This period was accented with feasting, dancing, and presenting gifts to the participants. The next step was to demarcate the site with the use of cedar-bark ropes [cedar as the World Tree in this area]. First to be staked out was the middle line from the front door to the back wall. The rope was then halved and stretched perpendicularly from the front stake to establish the front corners. The original length was again used from each corner stake to the back wall and the outline squared. [The same technique of halving was employed by carpenters in the Pacific, as noted in Schuetz-Miller, Abodes for the Gods....Indo Pacific, chaps. 7 and 8.] Four more days were expended in adzing the main beams and excavating waist-deep pits for the four major postholes.</page><page sequence="111">394 Journal of the Southwest Figure 35. Stonecutters and masons at work. (Redrawn from Sahajjun, Florentine Codex. Book 10, The People) (The Nootka are recorded as placing offerings in these pits.) Heavy roof beams were lifted into place with levers and pivots. The gable roof was then framed and wall boards tied on. The square floor pit was lined with carved planks, the earthen floor was tamped, and the walls were hung with mats. Compartments within the great house were made with board partitions or pole frames hung with mats. The hand-span and distance between the arm joints were used as units of measurement.205 Thompson River Indians made semi-subterranean pit houses that could accommodate fifteen to thirty residents. The house was outlined by crossing two ropes of the desired length at right angles oriented to the semi-cardinal directions; and the center and quarter midpoints were marked with stakes as guidelines for excavating a three- to four-foot-deep pit. Four (sometimes six) main house posts were set into the central area and notched to seat four diagonal roof beams. Several ways of framing the roof were employed, and some took rectangular rather than circu</page><page sequence="112">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico •&gt; 395 lar form. A webbing of rafters supported poles upon which grass, pine needles, sometimes bark, and earth were built up as a roof. Entry was by means of a notched log ladder at the center or to one side. At one time the top of the ladder was carved and painted into a bird or animal head to represent the guardian spirit of the head of the household.206 These carved ladders were comparable to Indonesian ones described in Schuetz-Miller, Abodes for the Gods....Indo-Pacific, chapter 6. Buildings of Southeast Woodland tribes were erected under the direction of medicine men. To construct a public building, a Creek holy man would cut little sticks "in miniature of the building" and distribute them to residents indicating their designated donation of cut logs to be delivered and assembled six days later. The sacred nature of the medicine man's responsibility was underscored by his required fast during this period.207 A more detailed account was written at the time of early European contact with Caddoan-speaking tribes in northeast Texas. Like the Hawai ians, they appear to have had a special class of priests, called caddi in this case, who were in charge of building their circular, beehive-shaped houses. An individual needing a new house went to the caddi, who assigned a day for the construction and sent messengers to all the households. The messengers carried as many sticks as the saplings needed for building, delivering one to each as a reminder to contribute a pole on the day designated. Other households were ordered to bring vara lengths of tree bark to use for withes. Additionally, one or two women at each house were each to bring a load of grass. The messengers slept at the new house site and were hosted by the prospective homeowners until the assigned day. Work began at daybreak. The caddi first "measured" the house then proceeded to direct the work. A tree trunk, trimmed of its branches and provided with a cross at the top "like a mast" was erected at the center. Holes were dug around the periphery and the saplings set into them. Two men, perched on the tree-cross, lassoed and lashed the saplings together at the top to form the dome. Webbing was lashed to the verticals and bundles of grass thatching were attached, beginning from the bottom up. Finally, the tree trunk was cut down. During construc tion, which required little more than half a day, the messengers enlivened the crowd by switching anyone who arrived late (men were given four or five lashes on the chest, women had their backs bared to administer the same)—to the laughter of all. The priest then blessed the house and everyone was feasted by the owners.208 Medicine men of the Pawnee,</page><page sequence="113">396 Journal of the Southwest a Caddoan-speaking Plains tribe, laid out their circular lodges with the use of a rawhide lariat.209 The tree trunk set in the center of the Caddo lodge would have served as the point of attachment for a rope of leather or fiber used as a compass in the same way. In the mythologies of most of the cultures scrutinized in this study and its two predecessors, a major god has been identified as the Divine Arti ficer who built the first temple. Egypt had Ptah, Sumeria had Enki, India Twastri, and the Huichol of Mexico had Grandfather Fire. Not only did this being teach men such mundane skills as brick making and erecting walls, but he taught them the greater mysteries of the heavens and how to apply the mysteries to mirror the firmament on earth through geometry. The first initiates into the arcane tradition were priest-astronomers, such as Egyptian Imhotep; or priest-kings, such as Mesopotamian Gudea. Old World evidence points to both classes having been drawn from a theocratic elite trained in temple schools. There is good reason to assume that the same background for master builders, engineers, and astronomers prevailed in the New World. As Old World civilizations evolved in complexity the more esoteric knowledge of the building crafts was gradually transmitted to professional classes outside the temple. Different categories of professionals—woodworkers, stoneworkers, and metalworkers, for example—banded together to protect their skills and knowledge from unwanted competition and for mutual aid through guilds, thereby successfully wresting a certain amount of autonomy for themselves. At the same time, however, the elite never completely severed the umbilical cord until forced to do so in the Middle Ages or Renaissance, depending upon how early any one country embraced the winds of Enlightenment and Humanism. The church maintained its moral influence through the religious brotherhoods of the guilds, civic leaders through maintaining city oversight of the guilds. In the absence of pre-European written evidence beyond memorializa tion of kings and calendrical counts, how far New World building artisans had developed toward some semblance of independence is impossible to determine. The few clues left by early Spanish chroniclers point to forms of state control under Nahua and Tarascan governments, but whether they operated as guilds in the European sense of the term we may never know. There is as yet no data from South America to suggest that craft specialists were organized in any manner other than through kin lineages.</page><page sequence="114">The Cosmic Cross and the Artisans of Mexico &lt;■ 397 Building sacred spaces, however, was never limited to the centers of civilization. Even hunter-gatherers, without the prompting of a priestly class, answered the compulsion to re-create the world according to their origin myths through their dwellings or spaces sanctified especially for the ritual reenactment of the act, or acts, of creation. In the final analysis, whether designed and supervised by priests, medicine men or shamans, lineages of craft specialists, or members of fully developed guilds working under the patronage of a deity, building artificers have left us an inheritance that enriches all our lives and defines our spiritual progress. In the final section I examine the skills of carpenters and masons who constructed anomalous architecture in the Americas.</page><page sequence="115">Anomalous Architecture and Final Statement Through many diverse births I have passed Seeking in vain the builder of the house.

Previous chapters touched upon buildings atypical relative to their surrounding cityscapes: snail-shaped oracular temples in Peru; and in Colombia circular terraces, rock-cut shaft tombs with burial cham bers carved in imitation of houses, and wood structures built with unusual carpentry techniques. This chapter examines other anomalous styles. A Spanish chronicler's observation of the Taironas' use of "curious carpentry" in the construction of the king's dwelling and "three great log cabins" invites the question whether there might be a connec tion to clay house models from the Bahia culture of the Manabl and Esmeraldas provinces of coastal Ecuador. Through articles published in 1961 and 1962, Emilio Estrada, Betty Meggers, and Clifford Evans brought to the attention of archaeologists their case for contact between the Jomon culture of Japan and the Americas. The earliest proposed contact was the Valdivia culture, which overlapped the Peruvian For mative. The type site, and related ones in Panama and Peru, dates the Valdivia to approximately 2500-1800 bce. From about 1800 to 500</page><page sequence="116">400 Journal of the Southwest Figure 36. Left: Haniwa ofTayoi house. (Drawn from a photograph in Haniwa). Right: Clay model of house of the Bahia culture, Ecuador. (Drawn from a photograph in Alfred Kidder II, "Rediscovering America") bce, the following Chorrera culture expanded from the coast to the interior following river valleys. Pottery produced during this time is said to be similar to wares from both the Chavi'n culture of Peru and the Ocos culture of coastal Guatemala and adjacent Mexico. The third chronological period, which is dated from about 200 bce to 500-700 ce, is called the Regional Developmental. It is characterized by dissimilar cultures, but large populations and advanced sociopolitical integration. The Bahia culture was one of these regional polities.210 The Manabf house model is one of several found in Ecuador per taining to the Bahia culture, The house type with its distinctive roof structure also appears on tomb models produced by the Tumaco culture of Colombia.211 Estrada and Meggers compared the Bahia examples to Han Chinese and Yayoi Japanese tomb models exhibiting unusual roof forms, as well as to actual buildings with "saddle-shaped" roofs from Sumatra, New Guinea, and the Carolines of Micronesia, including the same two I illustrate here as figure 36. "Saddle-shaped" roofs, as they are generally called, should be termed "boat-shaped." They were once prominent as dwellings for the elite throughout Micronesia (including in Yap, Kosrae, the Gilberts, as well as Palau) at the time of initial European contact. They are still con structed as men's houses in Melanesia. They appear to have their origin in a Southeast Asian Dong Son prototype. I am sure all are tied to the</page><page sequence="117">Anomalous Architecture and Final Statement -J- 401 belief that ancestors arrived in boats from the heavenly realm. They serve as the great clan houses on Sumatra and Sulawesi, and in Sumatra and Southeast Asia the elite were sent to the afterworld in boats or boat shaped coffins. Given the Valdivia-Jomon link of early contact between Japan and northern South America, looking toward a later contact between Yayoi and Tomb period Japan and Bahia is logical. Great advances were made in house construction in Japan's Late Yayoi (ca. 500 bce-300 ce) and Tomb (ca. 250-552 ce) periods, when Japan came under heavy influence from Han dynasty China. To effect the change, Chinese-trained Korean artisans were recruited, particularly from Paekche, until the kingdom was defeated by the Silla in 663 ce.212 These artisans likely introduced plank, board, and lath construction, regular plans, and use of mats as wall coverings. Two-storied dwellings were erected, and entrances were located not only on the south gable end (note the south-facing opening of China and Mongolia), but also on each side. By the fifth century ce, the Japanese were innovating with increasingly fanciful roofs: gabled, hipped, gambrel, boat-shaped, gabled with parapet-like barge boards (like figure 36 left), and the coxcomb form of figure 37 left, compared to one from the Mexican Gulf coast. One point to keep in mind is that all the illustrations are grave offerings. In the historic period of Palau, where the knowledge of ceramic technology had long since been forgotten, small wooden spirit houses, mounted on posts, were ubiquitous. The dating of the Bahia spirit house to Phase 1 suggests a possible contact date of a century or two on either side of the Christian divide, during the Late Yayoi or Early Tomb periods. I am convinced that advances made in house building resulted from those made in boat construction. In the Old World, both were sacred endeavors and were usually undertaken by high-ranking specialists. Every aspect of building had attendant rituals, including human sacri fice for structures of a sacred nature, including the residences of rulers. (Remember that both boats and the trees needed for their construction were associated with the Moon Goddess). Therefore, in considering possible Asiatic contacts for anomalous house styles, it is worth looking at unusual boat types as well. Figure 38 illustrates a haniwa boat model from Japan's fifth-century ce Middle Tomb period. It clearly indicates compound construction: a hollowed log keel with attached boards squared at the bow and stern and joined together with pegs, leaving bifurcated ends.

But even in the earlier period, the remains of deep-sea fish in middens attest to the fact that fishermen were venturing well beyond coastal waters.213 Father Cobo, who arrived in South America in 1609, recorded the variety of boats built in various places. There were the half-lunate reed boats of the coast, the full-lunate boats of Lake Titicaca, and the large sailing rafts with center boards capable of deepwater voyaging that were built around the ports of Payta Manta (Mauta?) and Guayaquil. An alto gether different kind of boat, however, was the piragua constructed by the Indians of Tierre Firme (Colombia and Venezuela). The lower part was a dugout canoe, but cane wattles were added to the sides and sealed with pitch to make it higher and wider. [The description could almost apply to the Khmer boat shown as figure 39.] A similar type, made by Chilean Indians, was a dugout with upturned ends to which three side strakes, apparently bent with fire, were sewn with thick rope made from fibers of a giant bamboo.214</page><page sequence="119">Figure 38.

The possibility that Tierradentro shaft tombs might have resulted from contact with Indonesia/Southeast Asia was raised in the opening sec tion. Mention has been made of the Teuchitlan Tradition that developed out of the older shaft tomb period of the Early Formative. Although the embryonic tradition is detected about 300 bce, its full-blown development occurred in parts of Nayarit and Jalisco around 200 ce, burned brightly for about seven hundred years, and disappeared abruptly at the end of the Classic period ca. 900. Its largest site, at Los Guachimontones, presents all the characteristics of the Teuchitlan culture. At the core of the village are three circular plazas with multilevel, circular step pyramids, each topped with a pole at the center. Surrounding each pyramid is a circle of several platforms on which houses with boat-shaped roofs marked with the god's eye design were built. The pyramids are interpreted as cosmograms [Cosmic Mountains], and the poles, probably used in the volador ceremony, as rep resentations of the World Tree. Around the village core are four rectangular plazas, two ball courts (see figure 40), and smaller buildings. The culture retained the re-enterable family shaft crypts with side chambers—still well furnished and sometimes decorated with murals—of the Early Formative prototype. By the Middle Teuchitlan Phase 1, they ceased constructing shaft tombs, and during Phase II (799-900) the circular centers were abandoned. The reason, or reasons, for the sudden collapse is unknown, unless it was connected to the ascendancy of the Tarascan state. With the onset of the Postclassic in western Mexico, new complexes with square or rectangular structures appeared in new locales.215 The god's eye symbols decorating the clay house models likely identify them as sacred structures, and an educated guess is that those surrounding the circular pyramids were lineage houses. My hypothesis is based upon small stone houses found in the Mayan city of Copan known as U waybill ch'ul (sleeping place of god), which probably served as lineage shrines. Their roofs have the same profile as the Teuchitlan models.216 Whereas the roof form is akin to the Japanese forms pictured in figure 37, other considerations of the Teuchitlan point to possible Indo-Pacific influence. These cult houses are also similar to the aforementioned Indonesian and Melanesian lineage or cult houses. The god's eye motif may have evolved in Southeast Asia, and the volador ceremony is still held in a few places in Mexico and on Pentecost Island in the New Hebrides, although in both areas it once had a wider distribution.217</page><page sequence="121">Anomalous Architecture and Final Statement v 405 Figure 40. Tomb figure from Itxtldn, Nayarit, depicting spectators watching a ballgame and twin temples delineating each end of the ball court. Teuchitlan Tradition. (Drawn from a photo in Covarrubias, Indian Art of Mexico and Central America) The volador of Mexico and its Melanesian equivalent are reenactments of the arrival of a creator from heaven, represented in the Mexican rite by four directional birds (signifying his omnipresence in the winds). Tomb figures from Mexico are depicted wearing penis sheaths like Melanesians. The ceremony along with related versions involving pole swinging and pole climbing once held among various tribes of the California coast and the U.S. Southwest are all connected with mourning rites, just as they were in Pacific cultures. In the ultimate analysis the volador pole—like the Sun Dance pole or the stambha of the Indian Fire Ceremony— represents the Tree of Life. The tree is carefully selected, ritually "killed," and treated like the dead god it is. The Asiatic Megalithic culture, distributed from Assam into Southeast Asia and Indonesia, spread via Melanesia to influence all the cultures of the Pacific. The Konyaks of Assam constructed stone circles with menhirs</page><page sequence="122">406 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest at the center in front of their men's houses, and the Angames created great stone pyramids over graves and built paved avenues and steps. The Toba Batak of Sumatra made stone terraces and terraced pyramids over graves of powerful chiefs. The Nias people erected small truncated pyramids that contained the skulls of important chiefs, along with the heads of slaves sacrificed as part of the funeral rite. Melanesians and Micronesians of Kosrae also constructed truncated pyramids with one or more burial shafts. Stone menhirs—sometimes with carved hornbills or chickens on the top (guides to the underworld), unhewn slabs, and square pillars—were ubiquitous as memorial posts and were tied to Feasts of Merit. Stone ossuaries in the form of houses were carved on Sulawesi. The K'un, or perhaps Mi-mo, of Yunnan were responsible for highly decorated bronze coffins in the form of houses with gabled roofs, and their grave goods included spirit houses and models of domestic animals. And as a last observation, this is an area of the world that developed an astonishing variety of sailing craft, leading to the creation of the great double canoes that made colonization of Polynesia possible.218 Khmer Influence? The new architecture of the Puuc hills in the Yucatan Peninsula is the third anomalous building style to be considered. The resemblance between the Puuc style and that of the Khmer of Cambodia, which was influenced by Javanese construction, is remarkable. The outstanding characteristic of both Puuc and Khmer is the copying in stone of what were originally wooden structures or details. The idea is of Indian origin, but it was most highly developed by the Khmers. The typical Cambodian complex had a central main sanctuary surrounded by four other shrines connected to it by cloisters—the plan thus representing the five cardinal points. These were in the nature of small temples built atop platforms or high terraces and accessed by four staircases. Decorative elements took the form of stone balustrades ending in serpent heads, window and door frames, false windows and doors, spindles, Kala monster heads with flame-like eyebrows, and projecting corner elements. Roofs were constructed with eighty-nine stronomi arches. Friezes depicted mythic themes, status symbols (palanquins, chariots, parasols, and fans), battle scenes, and war captives. Carved rosettes and beads decorated cornices and spring lines.</page><page sequence="123">Anomalous Architecture and Final Statement &lt;r 407 All these elements excepting chariots are typical of Puuc buildings as well. Some Khmer sanctuaries, such as Preah Khan, have holes drilled into the stones of interior walls, suggesting that metal plates, possibly of gold, were attached at one time. But Cambodian workmen were better at carving than building sound walls, which were inherently weak because the stones were laid so that the vertical joints lined up.219 In regard to the last point, note that the stones of the arch at Labna, Yucatan, are set in the same unstable fashion (figure 41). The arch incorporates two miniature thatched-roof houses flanked by false window screens above the entries to small rooms on either side of the arch. Another building at Labna features stones carved like turned spindles set in false windows and serving as door jambs (figure 42). Note, too, the beaded cornice crowning the lower register of the structure. A building at Sayil shows the same sort of opening in detail, as well as a Chac mask (figure 43). Compare these with the detail on the temple at Angkor, which has a false window complete with spindled screen and an elaborate cornice incorporating rosette and egg-and-dart motifs (figure 44). The construction of stone temples in Southeast Asia originated in India when King Asoka (272-232 bce) made Buddhism the state religion of the Mauryan dynasty. Hellenic and Persian stonemasons began the gradual transformation of sacred architecture from wood to stone. The first Buddhist temples carved into cliff walls date from the first century bce. Indian construction techniques in stone later diffused, along with Hinduism and Buddhism, to Java and from there to Cambodia. The age of the Khmer style, estimated to have developed between 800 and 1000 ce, and the florescence of the Puuc cities, between 750 and 800 ce, is a fairly good fit. A point I want to make apropos the Puuc style is a lesson I learned from my own research in architectural history. The new style, character ized by the "horror of blank space" typical of India, provided a canvas for sculptors rather than masons. The poor quality of construction in both Khmer and Puuc sites suggests that their builders were drawn largely if not entirely from the carpenters' trade. To account for an anomaly like the Puuc style, there is no need to assume foreign masons were involved. Occasional contact with Asia, whether by accident or design, would have occurred via fishing or trading vessels with shipwrights aboard. During extended stays in Mexico for repairing and recaulking the vessels, these shipwrights might have introduced the new style of building to local carpenters, who then incorporated homegrown motifs such as Chac</page><page sequence="124">Figure 41.

Research into building personnel in Alta California during the Spanish period showed that shipwrights were sometimes pressed into local service to build churches, missions, and presidios, and the records also reveal carpenters who became masons and stonecutters. Summary All early civilizations arose in estuaries and lower floodplains of major rivers in tropical and temperate zones about 7,000 years ago. Accord ing to new geophysical studies, the phenomenon might be correlated to the stability of sea level following its rapid rise from the Last Glacial Maximum, around 18,000 years ago, and an average temperature increase of 6 degrees. Shallower and warmer coastal waters produced enhanced marine resources capable of sustaining larger coastal populations and nearby farming communities. The process of urbanization led to class distinctions and governmental control capable of mustering labor crews to build public works, such as irrigation canals, bridges, and monumental architecture.220 This study has looked at examples of monumental architecture in the Americas from its initial appearance in South America around 3000 bce up to the period of the Spanish conquest and has noted particular features of construction techniques, engineering achievements, and structural embellishments that have parallels in sacred buildings in the Old World. The most noteworthy parallel is probably the application of pre-Euclidean geometry in designing sacred sites in both the Old and New Worlds. In Abodes for the Gods. The Symbolism of Ancient Sacred Architecture in Eurasia, I demonstrated the use of the full-blown system applied to Ur-Nammu's enormous temple complex (as well as an indi vidual ziggurat) as early as about 2560 bce, to Cheops's contemporary pyramid, and to British megalithic sites (including Stonehenge, at least by its Phase 2 period around 2100 bce). The early geometry, derived from astronomic observations, was sacred knowledge because it mirrored the celestial kingdom of the gods and ancestors. It was religious belief visualized, not mathematics. It ensured commensurate proportions, was adaptable to any standard of measurement, was easily taught, and prob ably was diffused by itinerant master builders via ancient trade routes. The use of the eight-pointed star, the symbol ofVenus in Mesopotamia and in the Americas, is particularly impressive in light of the Mayan pre</page><page sequence="127">Anomalous Architecture and Final Statement ■&gt; 411 occupation with Venus warfare into the sixteenth century. The analyses of Mesoamerican sites demonstrate an integration of cosmic view with geometry that is as good as it gets. They are as beautiful as Cheops's pyramid—which has the same volume as its imaginary enclosing circle, with both representing the sun—or the Buddhist temple of Borobudur in Java, where people bodily reenact the soul's journey from the sentient world to Nirvana as they ascend its terraces. Corollary to demonstrating the application of geometry to sacred architecture are my interpretations of symbols embedded in the structures based on the research that went into writing Retrieving Tribal Memory. First is the universal worldview of a Cosmic Cross with a Cosmic Moun tain and Tree of Life at the center and four sacred rivers issuing from its roots and dividing the world into quadrants. Other symbols based on creation myths range from the circular sunken courts at Haldas and Chavm in Peru to Pueblo kivas as metaphors for the Place of Emergence, polygonal or circular houses representing Spider Grandmother's web, and felines, other favored avatars of the Great Goddess, guarding her mountain temples. My proposal of a shared Paleolithic origin to account for the universal worldview and creation myths will undoubtedly strike many readers as far-fetched, but I leave the doubters to ponder a few examples of surviv ing vestiges of the old beliefs that illustrate just how conservative are the basic tenets of all religion. There is a description of the Cosmic Cross with a sacrificial lamb, as a substitute for the God Tree, at the center in the Book of Revelations. The earliest purely Christian structures of the Coptic and Byzantine churches were in the form of the equal-armed cross. In fact, it is known as a Greek Cross. The earliest baptismal fonts were octagonal: a form derived from the early geometry that perpetuated the association of the creatress with the sacred number eight from the Near East to India, her arachnid form with eight legs, and the eight-pointed star ofVenus. The early immersions of adults in these large fonts represented a symbolic death and resurrection. It is the same imagery of the Place of Emergence. The Tree of Life abounds in many forms. It is present in the green, sprouting Cross of the Resurrection in the Christian church and the Catholic devotions to Our Lady of Balvanera and Our Lady of the Pillar. Green, as the symbol of life, became the sacred color of Islam. Hindu women circumambulate the sacred ficus as a prayer for children. Maya still venerate their Yaxche. The bird atop the Tree of Life, or Pro phetic Tree, can be seen in the dove as the Holy Spirit and in the wise</page><page sequence="128">412 Journal of the Southwest old owl, respectively. Apropos the question of possible foreign influence in the examples of anomalous architecture, exotic styles could have been initiated through casual contact, but the underlying universal symbolism would have made the receivers receptive to innovation.

Dramatic archaeological discoveries made throughout China during the past two decades are revealing distinct cultures that challenge the old belief that Chinese culture emerged from various city-states, known as the Shang dynasty, that were built on the plains along the middle reaches of the Yellow River. As examples, a three-tiered earthen platform situated at the center of what was probably a fortified town uncovered at Longanagucheng, along the upper reaches of the Yangtze in Sichuan province, provided a date of about 3000 bce (Normile, "Yangtze Seen as Earliest Rice Site," 309). Avast area with hundreds of settlements along the coastal plains of the same river reaching to Shanghai, where rice had been domesticated since 7000 bce or longer, is identified with the Liangzhu Culture (3500-2250 bce). It produced walled cities protected with moats, and large mounds, some with burials that included finely carved</page><page sequence="130">414 Journal of the Southwest jade, ivory, and lacquer. These wares, found far and wide beyond its borders, are evidence of a considerable trade network. Earlier yet is the Hongshan Culture (4500-2250 bce) in northeastern Liaoning and Inner Mongolia where elaborate stone tombs held jade carved into phoenix and dragon forms. The extent of contact between the Chinese city-states and those to the west is yet undetermined (Lawler, "Beyond the Yellow River," 930-35). 21.

A friend informs me that a program on Mayan sacred architecture which aired on the History Channel in 2007 noted the burial of some Palenque noble with a carved jade square [earth] in one hand, a carved jade circle [heaven] in the other. 169. Ibid., 171-98; Epstein, "From a Remote Jungle Site," 98-113. 170. The reasons for the collapse of some Mayan city-states continue to be investigated. Increased warfare between states, overpopulation, social unrest, and degradation of the land have been put forth as possible causes. Geophysical research indicates several drought cycles, including a mega-drought that persisted from about 750 to 850 ce, the severest drought in 7,000 years. Solar variations, magnetic "jerks," and volcanic eruptions have also been suggested as causative factors (see Kerr, "Variable Sun and the Maya Collapse," 1293, Wong, "Too Warm for the Maya," 6-7; Gallet and Genevey, "Mayans," 129-30; and Pringle, "New Look at the Mayas' End," 454-56. 171.

New studies on skeletal material reveal that by 600 ce the site was in the throes of urban decay. Poor nutrition and infections, likely due to pollution and poor sanitation, are the suspected culprits (see "Urban Decay in Old Mexico"). 180. For Aztec directional symbolism see Duran, Book of the Gods, 392-93. 181.

Stuart, "Timeless Vision of Teotihuacan," 29. 183. Ibid., 8, 14. 184. The asymmetrical layout of the compound is so like Khmer temple com plexes that it led me to examine this feature at the time I was researching the theme of the World Mountain for Abodes for the Gods. The similarity is striking. 185. Directional associations are taken from Bonnefoy, Mythologies, 2:1179. 186. Matos Moctezuma, Great Temple of the Aztecs, 59-84. 187.
