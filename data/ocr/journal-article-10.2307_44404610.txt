<plain_text><page sequence="1">APPLICATION OF A FORMAL METHOD FOR READING PICTORIAL PHOTOGRAPHS The reader, if he refers to the method for reading pictorial photographs published in volume 5:4 of this quar- terly, pages 165-168, may be surprised to find that the order of the steps is not followed precisely by Mr. Durrell in his practical application of the methods. A Harvard graduate and a special student in photography at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Mr. Durrell was asked to rewrite for publication a final that he wrote some months ago in order to illustrate the all important flexibility in the use of a method for experiencing and reading photographs. The picture referred to, The Three Thirds , appears on page 77 of this issue. How the expe- rience of a photograph flows, what comes first by itself and what comes second of its own accord is considered far more important than rigid adherence to an outline. Observe his use of it as a checklist. james durrell jr. The Face of a House This photograph, reproduced on page 77, I called The Face of a House months before I knew the photographer's title. When I started, the picture seemed to be- long to the Pictorial Group and I went to work on it as such. During the rewriting it became obvious to me that the photograph really belongs to the Equivalent Group, but because I sought only to make readable what was experienced when the picture was first seen, this perfectly natural change of picture classification has not been de- scribed. first impression - part of one wall of an abandoned house, which by association be- comes a face, associations Before going on to examine the geog- raphy of the photograph it seems best to list all the associations that occurred to me. 1 A human face 2 A non-human face like that of an insect 3 Abandoned house 4 Face of a robot or mechanical mon- ster 5 A tank rolling a single, massive tread and viewed head-on 6 Life symbols, the three stages of man : birth (window with luminous cloud) , life (plaster oozes between laths like the juices from a plant), and death (shattered window) . During the period of concentration on the photograph the three associations of a face like that of a mechanical monster, and abandoned house, and a tank seen straight- on, gradually combined into one strong image which became my total experience of the picture; all the other associations fell in the path of this one, all-powerful image. What follows is an attempt to point to visible parts of the picture which are likely sources of how the image of a face grew to be my experience of the photograph. First, what led me to see the windows and clapboards as an abandoned house, and not a storage shed or other out-building? The crucial element was the plaster and lathwork which indicate a finished interior such as a human dwelling might have. The 84</page><page sequence="2">broken window, missing boards, tall field grass, and badly weathered condition of the wooden siding all seemed to say that this house has been abandoned by its hu- man occupants. Next, what about the face ? Considering only what is in the photograph, I saw the windows as two eyes, and the two rectan- gles of lathwork and plaster as the nostrils of a snout. The absence of a visible mouth or ears did not weaken my anthropomor- phic association, once it had begun to de- velop. design The formality of the design made the face quite clear to me from the start. If the photograph had not been made from a camera position opposite the center of the wall, and at a fairly short distance from the wall, the final image would not have been arranged so symmetrically. Without both these factors the face would not have ap- peared at all, or would have been so weak- ened as to have lost significance. Because of the formal design, the two windows, the space between them, and the small white rectangle became the three most important areas in the photograph. The contrast be- tween the broken and the unbroken win- dow makes them visually the most attrac- tive areas in the picture. The contrast in moods between the windows, and their po- sition in relation to the nostrils transform the windows into most expressive eyes. The small white rectangle near the center of the photograph, became a fixation point to which my eyes constantly returned. The final effect of the symmetrical design was to force me to gaze straight into this strange, non-human face. space : seems to be the next important visu- al factor which shaped my feelings and associations. I was confronted by a single, extremely flat plane, which cut directly across the line of vision and prevented my eyes from passing through, or around this barrier. The broken window affords the only opening of any consequence, but the black void within discourages entrance. On the other hand, the cloud reflected in the unbroken window, gave me the sense of space in front of the house, over my head, and behind me. The final result was the feeling that I could not move visually into the photograph, but that the subject of the photograph could move forward into the space behind me ! tone : seems to have had considerable bear- ing on my feelings and experiencing of the picture. The dark wood sets a pre- dominant tone of somberness that increases the feeling of strangeness, of impending danger. This is no light-hearted affair; something quite unpleasant is going on here. The various thin white edges, lines and spots produce a dynamic contrast which intensifies the harsh, straight angularity of the image. The end result is a ghastly tank- insect face of unbearable force - a veritable Frankenstein ! At this point the elements of design, space, and form seem to account for all my associations not stemming directly from the subject matter; they seem to be all that is required to spark my associations and set them combining, interacting, and growing. Because adherence to an outline is useful as a check list, let us now go over the points that have been omitted. Not all apply to this photograph, but the following few seem to have some bearing in my view of the image. Open form makes the face seem larger and more powerful than perhaps it 85</page><page sequence="3">actually is, because its exact dimensions are not defined. The face is so close that it liter- ally seems to grow as I look at it. With its true size unknown and unseen, the face on the wall becomes more threatening and dangerous than ever. The light concept, as far as I can see it, is not at all important here. As I follow the outline and examine texture, I find texture does play a vital role in my feeling. The diffuse sunlight under which the picture was made, minimizes the texture of the wood. Hence, instead of be- ing aware of the substance of wood, and the separate boards in the structure, the long horizontal ridges of the siding sud- denly reminded me of tractor treads on a tank or bulldozer. From there on the asso- ciations rapidly began to fuse: abandoned house, tank treads, and grotesque face. They merged into one intense feeling that lasted several minutes - and has not yet worn off. final impression Confronted head on by the face of an abandoned house, its two eyes stared di- rectly at me. The black interior, seen in the one eye, symbolized for me the utter emp- tiness of the deserted house. It soon grew to be felt as the mourning of the house for the loss of its human occupants. Yet the other eye began to express hope by the softness and luminosity of the reflected clouds. This contrast in moods between the two windows, or eyes of the house, made it seem to me that this old house could have human emotions ... or at least I was willing at the time to pursue such personal projections to discover where they might lead. As the anthropomorphic association in- creased, the building became a demon with two glaring eyes, especially the jagged, broken one. Between the eyes the laths and plaster became the nostrils of the creature's snout, and at a distance of a few feet, the whole area between the windows seemed to protrude in a terrifying manner. The horizontal lines of the siding became tank treads, and with this final association, the whole house became a mobile creature which surged directly towards me, as if to take revenge on man for having been de- serted and left to decay. The creature seemed to drool at the nostrils in anger at man and the grass quakes before the irre- pressible forward thrust of the enraged be- ing. The small white rectangle held my eyes transfixed to the face of the onrushing being, and made me feel virtually trapped, and at the mercy of the dark, avenging spirit. Such was my final impression, and at that time (and even since) the experience of being confronted by the avenging de- mon, made all other associations com- pletely inadequate. Even now, many weeks after my initial reading with the class, I am unable to forget my original sensations, and follow the path of other possible asso- ciations. Once having experienced the face, nothing else seems quite as potent. Intel- lectually I can grasp the photographer's title Three-Thirds, meant to indicate that in man the crisis of birth and death are two-thirds of his life. However, this was not my experience, and may never be. 86</page></plain_text>
