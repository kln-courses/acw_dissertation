Theodicies, or metaphysical attempts to solve the problem of evil, have relied on a special application of this principle of explanatory rationalism, namely, the principle of plenitude, which holds that the evil in the world is a necessary ingredient in the world's overall perfection or degree of reality. This essay argues that the principle of plenitude is aesthetically motivated, and that only in art and perhaps in revealed religion can the demands of explanatory rationalism be satisfied. Keywords: aesthetics, essentialism, metaphysics, rationalism, theodicy. I may say that the causality of the Supreme Cause holds the same place with regard to the world that human reason does with regard to its works of art. - Immanuel Kant1 Tragedy is vastly preferable to absurdity. - Norman Mailer2 The problem of evil falls within theology, and theology that is rational theology and not revealed religion is a part of metaphysics. These topical relations of containment will dictate my order of exposition. I shall begin with some remarks concerning metaphysics in general and then move on to the more specific issues of rational theology and the problem of evil. Finally, I shall make the connection, perhaps at first sight remote, between the problem of evil and aesthetics.3 1 1977, 100 (par. 58, note). 2 1995, 607. 3 My title was motivated in part by Peter Kivy's brief discussion of "the problem of evil" in music.

Over the centuries, and particularly since Kant, metaphysics has been many things, and I shall not be concerned with all of them. The metaphysics I shall be discussing is a dominant strain within what might broadly be called the Western Aristotelian and Platonic/Neoplatonic traditions. This type of metaphy sics I shall characterize as a first-order, systematic body of theory that purports to account exhaustively for everything that is and for the way everything is. The qualifier exhaustively is important, for a salient characteristic of this strain of the metaphysical tradition is that it understands its task to be one of satisfying completely what in the seventeenth century explicitly came to be called "the principle of sufficient reason": everything is, and is the way it is for a reason. About the extreme vagueness and variability of this principle we shall have more to say. Now this characterization of metaphysics may look far too broad, since it would seem to apply also to natural science. After all, does not natural science subscribe to the principle of sufficient reason? Does it not aspire to provide exhaustive explanations for the phenomena it investigates? Here we have our first encounter with the vagueness of which I warned. Natural science certainly may be said to subscribe to some version of the principle of sufficient reason. Natural science, however, most emphatically does not aspire to exhaustive explanations. Rather, its commitment to the principle of sufficient reason is limited and selective: there are some issues concerning which it remains silent. Physics, for example, may attempt to subsume the behaviors of material bodies under a small number of fundamental laws - indeed, under as small a number of such laws as possible. Yet, having isolated these, it does not explain why we find these laws instantiated and not others. Celestial mechanics may account for the (approximately) elliptical shape of the planetary orbits. But it cannot tell us why there are nine planets in our solar system, or why they revolve around the sun in the direction they do. These are matters of historical accident.4 Thermo dynamics may have established its set of laws, and special relativity the functional relationship between mass and energy expressed in Einstein's famous equation. But they have not raised, nor have they attempted to answer, the question, What is energy? any more than Newton thought it useful to speculate on the inner nature of gravitational force. About such issues, scientia naturalis hypotheses non fingit. 4 Cf. Weinberg (1992, 37): "The most extreme hope for science is that we will be able to trace the explanation of all natural phenomena to final laws and historical accidents." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="3">252 CHARLES NUSSBAUM All this is to say that scientific explanations tend to recognize and to accept an ineliminable element of contingency in the world. There is a brute-fact aspect to the world to the extent that there are aspects of the world for which there seem to be no scientific explanations at all. I do not refer here at all to the much-cited, perhaps over-cited, revelations from quantum theory concerning the indeterminism that besets the behavior of subatomic particles. Rather, these points apply as well to classical mechanics as they do to quantum mechanics. Even the proverbial Laplacean Intelligence would be powerless to eliminate the contingency in question: given a complete-state description of the universe, this Intelligence was said to be able to predict infallibly all future states. But why the laws on which the Intelligence bases its calculations are the ones operative in the universe, what the provenance is of the initial state of the universe from which all calculations are made (if there is such a state), and why there exists anything at all rather than nothing are questions it cannot answer: for it, as for more limited human scientific investigators, the first question runs up against a brute fact, while the second and third are, given classical assumptions, unanswerable. I do not suggest that this general tendency on the part of natural scientific theory to countenance the presence of contingency is not as it should be. Quite the contrary. For it is entirely in accord with the empirical bent of natural science, which purchases its extraordinary explanatory depth5 by sacrificing a certain kind of thoroughgoing intelligibility. This is to say that natural science does not subscribe to what has been called (Bennett 1984) "explanatory rationalism," an ideal of knowledge that aspires to the elimination of the brutely factual, and one that tends to attribute the apparent contingency in the world to the limitations of finite human cognizers. The metaphysical tradition we are now considering, on the other hand, did subscribe to explanatory rationalism. Indeed, this, as I have already suggested, is one of its defining characteristics. Moreover, there are, I propose, just two fundamental ways in which the philosophers of this tradition attempted to remove contingency from their metaphysical cosmologies. The first strategy I shall call the modal approach and the second the teleological, although there is a connecting thread between them that I shall point out later on. There are, it seems, few if any absolutely pure cases of the use of one approach to the exclusion of the 5 Barrow suggests (1991, 10-11, 199-201) that the explanatory depth of a physical scientific theory can be measured by invoking a notion deriving from information theory: a theory's depth is directly related to the degree of algorithmic compression achieved by its formulae, that is, the extent to which its statements of law can predict recurring patterns in widely differing ranges of phenomena that have significantly greater informational content than the laws themselves. The fundamental idea seems to be this: To the extent that the explanations of a science approach the complexity of the phenomena they are supposed to explain, explanatory adequacy approaches zero. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="4">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 253 other. Indeed, absolutely pure versions of these two approaches may not ultimately be workable, or at least may not be able to satisfy the requirements of explanatory rationalism. Be this as it may, two of the great rationalist philosophers of the seventeenth century, Spinoza and Descartes, come as close as any to pure cases of the modal and the teleological approaches, respectively; and the third great rationalist of this period, Leibniz, is a particularly good example of a mixed approach. My aim here is not primarily exegetical. In what follows I shall be using the views of these philosophers as orientational markers to survey an expanse of intellectual terrain. The strategy will be to stake out a range of cases marked by Spinoza and Descartes on the extremes and by Leibniz in the middle, a range on which other philosophers of the tradition and beyond can then be located. A strategy close to hand for the philosopher who takes the modal approach is to assert strict causal determinism under causal laws that are logically and metaphysically necessary. This is a move Spinoza makes. Causal determinism, both physical and psychological, is clearly affirmed in Ethics 1, prop. 28 (1985, 432) and throughout the work. Spinoza seems to have believed that psychological causation is nomic, since ideas are modes of the attribute of thought, and all existing things (that is, all finite modes) fall under the laws of the divine nature (425, 1, prop. 17). But he does not distinguish clearly between laws of psychology and laws of logic, and this poses special problems of interpretation. Let us, therefore, put his psychological determinism to one side and direct our attention to his physical determinism, remembering that the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things (451, 2, prop. 7). Motion and rest, as "modifications" of the infinite attribute of extension, constitute one of God's immediate infinite modes. The attribute of extension, however, also includes the laws of motion and rest (cf. Bennett 1984, 112). Since an attribute "expresses an eternal and infinite essence" of a substance (409, 1, def. 6), and since what is eternal must hold sempiternally - that is, at all times and in all places - these causal laws are necessarily as they are. Spinoza's modal explanatory rationalism, that is to say, takes the form of a "causal rationalism" (Bennett 1984, 32, 114). Although Spinoza may seem to recognize contingency in his system by way of the finite modes - the individual things in nature subject to generation and decay - he explicitly states that "in nature there is nothing contingent" (433, 1, prop. 29), understanding the contingent to be that which is neither necessary nor impossible because of its essence or its causal provenance (436, 1, prop. 33, dem.). The only contingency Spinoza is willing to recognize is epistemological: "But a thing is called contingent only because of a defect of our knowledge" (436, 1, prop. 33, dem.). Everything in nature is necessarily the way it is because everything finite is causally dependent on something else finite, and the entire chain of finite causes ultimately is dependent on God as immanent efficient cause: © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="5">254 CHARLES NUSSBAUM "Whatever we conceive to be in God's power, necessarily exists" (439, 1, prop. 35). If a certain number of individuals exist in nature, says Spinoza, there must be a reason (that is, a cause) why neither more nor fewer exist (415, 1, prop. 8, schol. 2). Although the textual evidence is not conclusive, such claims suggest that Spinoza may well have held the extreme view that the actual world is the only possible world (cf. Bennett 1984, 114ff.). Why, then, should we call Spinoza's approach a mixed and not a pure case of the modal approach? Notice that Spinoza does not simply say that whatever exists, exists necessarily because of God and causal determin ism. His claim is much stronger than that: the essence of Deus sive Natura includes the complete set of causal principles required for the production of all finite modes conceivable by an infinite intellect. This, however, is not aimless profligacy but perfection: God or Nature could not lack any divinely conceivable finite modes without suffering a decline in his/its degree of reality. Spinoza subscribes, that is, to a version of the "principle of plenitude," which, as Lovejoy (1936) has documented, is a pervasive theme running through the entire metaphysical tradition we are considering: a richer, more ontologically replete world, provided it is systematically unified, is a more perfect world. Spinoza's commitment to the principle of plenitude is quite evident in the following passage: But to those who ask "why God did not create all men so that they would be governed by the command of reason?" I answer only "because he did not lack material to create all things, from the highest degree of perfection to the lowest or, to speak more properly, "because the laws of his nature have been so ample that they sufficed for producing all things which can be conceived by an infinite intellect." (446, 1, appendix, emphasis added)6 Spinoza may deny that God has any will, aims, or purposes, and he may be contemptuous of final causality and teleological explanations. Yet, because of his commitment to the principle of plenitude, Spinoza's theology makes significant common cause with teleological approaches to explanatory rationalism. The world according to Spinoza is a world as ontologically rich as possible, a world exemplifying the greatest compossible repleteness (see my note 6). These claims follow on the 6 It is obvious that not everything conceivable by an infinite intellect is compossible. By "all things which can be conceived" Spinoza could, however, have meant "the greatest number of things which can be conceived together sempiternally," that is, through an infinite time in an infinite (Euclidean) space, contrariety being resolved by temporal and spatial relations. On the other hand, he could have held, as Lovejoy suggests, that while the world of thought and extension is constrained by conditions of compossibility, God, to whom an infinity of attributes appertains, can be qualified by contrary predicates, because in God these predicates have a more "eminent" signification. According to this second interpretation the mystical Neoplatonic doctrine of the coincidentia oppositorum survives in Spinoza's philosophy (cf. Lovejoy 1936, 343, note 36). Cf. Wolfson (1934, 1: 243): "[Spinoza's] God ... is not identical with the physical universe. He transcends it." We need not attempt to adjudicate this issue here. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="6">\l SIH1 I ICS AND THE PROBLEM Oh I VII 255 assumptions that God is infinitely powerful, that the world is an aspect of God, and that infinite power must produce finite modes exemplifying all degrees of perfection that can be conceived by an infinite intellect. Such argumentation, however, displays a marked affinity to Leibniz's deployment of the principle of perfection, which is explicitly teleological. In accordance with the principle of perfection, says Leibniz, God chooses the best possible world, and the best possible world is the most ontologically replete and orderly world that is internally compossible. Spinoza, on the other hand, tells us that such a world follows of necessity from God's power, but not from any act of divine choice. It is, however, manifestly impossible for the Leibnizian God to do anything other than choose the best,7 despite Leibniz's habitual, and perhaps disingenuous, use of the language of "inclination" as opposed to "necessitation." There is some justice in Lovejoy's charge (and Russell's as well [1945, 593]) that "[a]n absolute logical determinism, then, is as characteristic of the metaphysics of Leibniz as it is of that of Spinoza, though the reasons why are somewhat more complicated in the former case, and though Leibniz lacked the candor and courage to express the certain, and almost obvious, outcome of his reasonings, in his more popular writing, without obscuring it by misleading if edifying phraseology" (Lovejoy 1936. 173-74). In Leibniz's theology the best of all possible worlds is a necessitated divine choice; in Spinoza's theology such a world (for him, perhaps, the only possible world) is just divine necessity.8 For neither philosopher, moreover, can there be alternative compossible worlds that are as ontologically replete as the actual world. On Spinoza's principles, the world could not deviate from the actual without being less perfect, since the world is an aspect of God, and God is perfect: "Things have been produced by God with the highest perfection, since they have followed necessarily from a given most perfect nature" (436, 1, prop. 33, schol. 2). On Leibniz's principles, a divine choice between equally ontologically replete internally compossible worlds would have been unmotivated and capricious: there would have been no reason for God's actualization of this world as opposed to the alternative one. But this is also impossible: Let us assume, for example, that God chooses between A and B and that he takes A without having any reason for preferring it to B. I say that such action by God is not praiseworthy, for all praise should be based on some reason, and there is none here, by hypothesis. I hold, instead, that God does nothing for which he does not deserve to be praised. (Leibniz 1686, 305) 7 Spinoza forcefully makes a similar point himself against other opponents (1: 437-38, prop. 33, schol. 2). 8 Cf. Lovejoy (1936, 172): "Consequently, Leibniz's introduction of the notion of compossibility did not of itself, as he sometimes seems to have supposed, essentially differentiate his principle of sufficient reason from Spinoza's universal necessity." &lt;: Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="7">256 CHARLES NUSSBAUM It could perhaps be argued that what should be said is not that there is any teleological undertow in the Spinozist waters but that the Leibnizian position is covertly nonteleological. This, however, threatens to degenerate into a quibble concerning what word may be used to describe these cognate views. The best thing to say, I suggest, is this: both positions have modal and teleological aspects (see the discussion of Leibniz below), but in Spinoza's philosophy the modal aspect is strongly dominant. Rescher (1967, 29-30) takes exception to the Lovejoy interpretation on the grounds that it underestimates the Leibnizian emphasis on divine choice. We have seen, however, what such "choice" really amounts to. It may be countered that while there is and can be nothing arbitrary or willkuerlich in his decisions, Leibniz's God possesses a will. He wills to create a world ontologically distinct from himself, while Spinoza's God wills nothing and creates nothing ontologically distinct, but sustains all that is through his/its infinite power. For Leibniz, God's causality is final causality; for Spinoza, it is just efficient causality. Let these points be granted: it is such differences, I maintain, that make the Leibnizian approach to explanatory rationalism more of a mixed one. The philosopher who emphasizes the teleological over the modal approach will tread a very different path. Such a philosopher will trace the provenance of the laws of nature back to the will of God, thereby rationalizing them. If God's will is the reason certain apparently brute facts are as they are, we can rest assured that they are not brute, even if we are not in a position entirely to understand God's purposes. Once again, such is just what we observe, this time in Descartes's philosophy. For him, not only is it the case that causal laws could have been different, had God willed it so; more radically, the laws of mathematics and of logic themselves could have been different as well.9 How, without logic, God comes to a motivated and not utterly capricious decision as to how to arrange logic, Descartes does not explain, which may itself explain why this particular move occasioned such hostility on the part of a critic like Leibniz (1680, 273). But what is quite clear is that whatever God's decisions are, they are for the best. Such a view follows directly from Descartes's acceptance of the traditional Anselmian definition of God, as is evident in his presentation of the ontological argument in meditation 5, as well as from the momentous consequences concerning the reliability of the epistemic criteria of clarity and distinctness that Descartes takes to flow from God's concurrence. If God's perfection prevents him from 9 Cf. Descartes (1984, 291): "[I]t is impossible to imagine that anything is thought of in the divine intellect as good or true, or worthy of belief or action or omission, prior to the decision of the divine will to make it so ... [God] did not will that the three angles of a triangle should be equal to two right angles because he recognized that it could not be otherwise." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="8">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 257 being a deceiver (a moral flaw), surely the same perfection prevents him from deciding for anything other than the best. Why, then, is Descartes's approach mixed rather than pure? Once God has chosen principles of logic and has established res extensa along with three fundamental laws of motion,10 a version of causal rationalism prevails. The motion within res extensa may be introduced and maintained at a constant level by God from the outside (Descartes 1984, 240; Prendergast 1975; Brown 1989; Garber 1992, 205); but once it is so introduced and maintained, all particular motions of bodies are in principle deducible from their size, shape, and speed using principles of geometry and pure mathematics alone (Descartes 1984, 247). Descartes's geometrical physics, that is to say, differs radically from Newtonian mechanics. Descartes does not distinguish mass from weight, and because weight is not a geometrical property he denies that it is essential to matter (1984, 224, 227). As a result, he does not treat bodies as mass points, nor does he hypothesize any dynamic principle of universal gravitation. He holds the physical world to be a plenum and denies the possibility of empty space or of action at a distance. Circular or vortical motion results from the deflection of the rectilinear motion of bodies by other bodies, not from centripetal acceleration. If Descartes had been successful in his attempt to derive principles of impact and motion a priori from geometry," this would have provided them, at least, with a relative modality of necessity - relative, that is, to God's will. As I have already indicated, it is in Leibniz's philosophy that we encounter an attempt to take a fully mixed approach. For Leibniz, all true categorical propositions are analytic, and those that are not categorical are reducible to categorical ones. But these analytic propositions are divided into two classes. Truths of reason are "finitely analytic" and necessary. These are general (universally quantified) analytic categorical propositions whose subject concepts contain a finite set of marks and are thus reducible by means of analysis to explicit "identities" (logical truths). Since they are necessary, they are true in all possible worlds. But because their deep logical structure is hypothetical and not categorical, they need not bring with them any existential commitments. As universally quantified propositions, truths of reason are formal implications. But they are not merely formal, for they express 10 Descartes justifies all three laws (the law of "inertia," the law of rectilinear motion, and the law of impact) by invoking the simplicity and immutability of the divine nature (1984, 240-43). On some tellings (see Garber 1992), Descartes's God does not legislate these laws directly; he merely arranges for bodies to move in accordance with them. 11 Cf. Descartes (1984, 245): "These matters [rules for calculating the speed and direction of moving bodies after impact] do not need proof since they are self-evident &lt;the demonstrations are so certain that even if our experience seemed to show us the opposite, we should still be obliged to have more faith in our reason than in our senses &gt;." Actually, these seven rules were quite inaccurate. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="9">258 CHARLES NUSSBAUM real, and not merely nominal, definitions of the intelligible essences that exist as ideas in the divine intellect. The second class contains the particular (existentially quantified) truths that are "infinitely analytic." Because their subject concepts contain infinite sets of marks, they cannot be reduced by analysis to explicit logical truths, not even by God. Such truths, therefore, are logically contingent: the putative referent of the subject concept of any such truth must be instantiated if it is to be a truth at all; and no such entity must be instantiated (except for God himself). Since these concepts contain infinite sets of marks, and since Leibnizian concepts are individuated by their contents or intensions, there is an infinite range of possible individual concepts to choose from. As a consequence, God is free, constrained only by considerations of logical compossibility, to choose which concepts he will instantiate as existent monads, or individual substances. Of course, he chooses for the best: this world of ours is the "best of all possible worlds." And what is best (most perfect) is for Leibniz, as it is for Spinoza, determined by the principle of plenitude: that world is best which is as ontologically replete and as orderly as possible. Such a world is maximally "harmonious" (Rutherford 1995, 31 35). In the case of the mathematically minded Leibniz, plenitude is conceived on the model of the mathematical continuum, as mathematical continuity was then understood: all the existent monads form as compact a series as possible.12 From God on down the scale of perfection, each monad is distinguished, according to the principle of the identity of indiscernibles, not only by its "complete concept" but also by the law of the unique, temporally ordered series of its representational states (Rutherford 1995, 151-54). Although God's choice is not necessitated in a logical or a metaphysical sense, it is morally necessitated. Yet this, as Leibniz repeatedly insisted, is not really necessitation but a kind of strong "inclination." Despite the fact that God really cannot but act for the best, there is still room, according to Leibniz, for choice and a divine teleology. Explanatory Rationalism, Theodicy, and Essentialism It is easy to see that the theologies of Leibniz and Descartes are theodicies: they are attempts to reconcile the presence of evil in the world with the existence of an all-good, all-powerful, all-knowing supreme being. While Leibniz's theodicy is explicit (indeed, he seems to have coined the term [Rutherford 1995, 18, note 1]), Descartes's is implicit (recall his discussion in meditation 4 of the general problem of defects in himself and other divine products). Spinoza's theology is not, strictly 12 According to Russell (1945, 594—95), Leibniz seems to have believed that the best possible world (the most orderly world with the greatest number of compossibles) could be identified by means of formal calculation alone. Q Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="10">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 259 speaking, a theodicy, because for him, 'good' and 'evil', as morally evaluative terms, mark no univocal objective distinction at all, not even the privative one of the Neoplatonic tradition. Nothing is good or evil in itself. Good is that which facilitates the conatus of a thing, its endeavor to persevere in its being (498, 3, prop. 6); evil is that which hinders it. This, however, renders any judgments of good and evil relative, relative at least to the modal essences if not to each individual finite mode. Still, all three philosophers rely on the principle of plenitude13 to rationalize evil by making evils, or, as in Spinoza's case, the kinds of circumstances and events human beings think of as evils, a necessary ingredient in reality. Without these apparent defects reality would lack plenitude and would be less perfect. In what follows I shall argue that such attempts to rationalize evil fail because this kind of explanatory rationalism is misguided, and that this kind of explanatory rationalism is misguided because it rests on a fundamental error: the error of attributing to the cosmos any necessity other than causal necessity understood as counterfactual-supporting necessity under logically and metaphysically contingent causal laws, the only version of necessity required by scientific explanation.14 Moreover, as I shall also try to show, this error rests on a more general misconception that infects the metaphysical tradition of which we have been speaking. The brief characterization of this misconception is "descriptionist metaphysical essentialism." According to this version of essentialism, the necessary (a metaphysical category) is identified with the a priori (an epistemological category). Entities have essences and are picked out by privileged descriptions that are insensitive to empirical pressure, thereby yielding a fund of purportedly necessary material statements that are true a priori and that remain true, come what may. Ignoring Kantian transcendental arguments for the synthetic a priori as a special case falling outside the metaphysical tradition under discussion, such truths have traditionally been held to be self-evident (or to be entailed by self-evident truths), and their epistemic warrant has been claimed to derive either from intellectual intuition (as in Descartes and Spinoza)15 or from conceptual analysis (as in Leibniz). This descriptionist-essentialist view is quite different from the "microstructural" essentialism associated these days with Kripke and others, for here the identification of the necessary with the a priori is rejected (see the discussion in the next section). On this alternative 13 Descartes's commitment to the Neoplatonic conception of the Great Chain of Being is evident in his argument for God's existence in meditation 3 that relies on complementary degrees of "formal reality" of causes and "objective reality" of ideas. He also explicitly endorses a version of the principle of plenitude in meditation 4. 14 I shall note a possible exception to this claim in the next section. 15 Cf. Spinoza (1985, 2: 480, prop. 43, schol.): "It is as necessary that the mind's clear and distinct ideas are true as that God's ideas are." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="11">260 CHARLES NUSSBAUM essentialist account, natural kinds like water or gold are indeed accorded essences: the mass terms water and gold function as rigid designators, and 'Water is hydrogen hydroxide' and 'Gold has an atomic number of 79' are held to be metaphysically necessary, that is, true in all possible worlds. Given these metaphysical claims concerning natural essences, it might seem that such statements also purport to remain true, come what may. But this is not the case. Such natural essences are discovered empirically, and statements characterizing the atomic microstructure of elements and compounds like gold and water are laden with physical theory and could be false. 'Gold' and 'water' appear in the laws of chemistry, and their microstructures help account for their causal powers or dispositions. Empirical theory, however, is subject to revision. Whatever the microstructure of water is, on the Kripke view it is what it is necessarily, that is, in all possible worlds. But we could be wrong about what it is, just as an informative identity statement using rigid designators can be false. The identity is necessary and true in all possible worlds, if it is true at all (cf. Kripke 1971, 77). The epistemic warrant of microstructural identity claims, therefore, is most assuredly funded not by intellectual intuition or by conceptual analysis but by scientific demonstration. Central to the metaphysical tradition under discussion, on the other hand, is the conviction that essentialist descriptions transcend empirical evidence because they meet conditions of rational intelligibility. As a result, there is, as I hope to show, a deep anthropomorphic illusion that pervades descriptionist metaphysical essentialism (hereafter, in general mention, simply essenti alism), a tendency to assume that the world is in its essence as intelligible as it would be if it were planned by a being like us or constituted according to rules in principle understandable by us. In my discussion I shall, then, be using the expression essentialism pejoratively, as it has been used in recent times by Popper and by Quine. But the metaphysical tradition has had its earlier critics as well. Verum et factum convertantur, said Vico: the true and the made are convertible, meaning that we can fully understand only what we have made. We may have made the empirical theories whereby we attempt, with varying degrees of success, to explain the world and represent its lawful structure to ourselves; but we have not made the world, nor have we endowed it with whatever nomological structure it has. In what follows I shall attempt to isolate two distinct forms of this anthropomorphic illusion. The first form derives from a confusion between the properties of language and those of the objects of language, and the second from a confusion between the causal explanation of natural events and teleological explanation of human making and doing. Each of these confusions will be seen, respectively, to underlie the two metaphysical approaches to the elimination of the contingent, the modal and the teleological, detailed above. I shall end by suggesting that the © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="12">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 261 speculative metaphysics of the tradition attempts to accomplish what only a type of art and perhaps revealed religion can accomplish: the complete rationalization of its object, 'rationalization' here to be quite broadly conceived as the achievement of thoroughgoing intelligibility. This grouping of art, religion, and metaphysics may suggest the Hegelian trinity of Absolute Spirit. But as we shall see, if this is a Hegelianism at all, it is a Hegelianism turned on its head. Language and Modality In a series of now classic writings (1953a; 1953b; 1960; 1961; 1975; 1977) Quine has argued that modal logic - that is, a logic that employs the modal words necessarily and possibly as sentential operators-is inherently misconceived. I shall rehearse the familiar parts of Quine's arguments only briefly. He begins by pointing out that modal logic generates significant conflicts with the principle of extensionality. According to this principle, which holds a fundamental place in quantified first-order logic, all co-extensional expressions must be mutually substitutable salva veritate. The number 9 is necessarily greater than 7, and the expressions 9 and the number of the planets refer to the same number; but it is false that the number of the planets is necessarily greater than 7. The number of the planets just happens to be greater than 7; it is not necessary that it be greater than 7. This is intended to show that modal contexts are referentially opaque: co-referring expressions are not substitutable salva veritate. Referential opacity by itself is not a problem. We can reconstruct 'necessarily' as a semantic predicate; and we can treat all such statements as we treat statements in intentional contexts that require single quotation marks and that are, as a consequence, recognizably referen tially opaque. But when we do this, we no longer have anything that is properly called a statement in first-order modal logic; we merely have a metalinguistic statement that attaches a predicate to the name of the object-language statement. And this amounts, in turn, simply to this: to say that '9 is greater than T is necessary is just to say that it is logically true, assuming that logic is not limited to first-order predicate logic plus identity but includes set theory. Because this move dismantles modal logic, the modal logician will have none of it. She wishes to use 'necessarily' as a sentential operator. That is, she wishes to apply 'necessarily' to open sentences to which quantifiers can be attached. This of course disallows the Quinean strategy outlined above: quantification into quotational referentially opaque contexts is problematical. From 'Philip believes that Tegucigalpa is in Nicaragua' we seem to be able to infer by existential generalization 'There is an x such that Philip believes that x is in Nicaragua'. From this, we can infer by existential instantiation 'Philip believes that a is in Nicaragua.' If © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="13">262 CHARLES NUSSBAUM we replace the constant 'a' with 'Tegucigalpa', we shall get back the (presumably true) de dicto mode sentence with which we began. But Tegucigalpa = the capital of Honduras, and if we replace 'a' with 'the capital of Honduras', we shall get the obvious falsehood (when also taken in the de dicto mode) 'Philip believes that the capital of Honduras is in Nicaragua'. Similarly, from '9 is necessarily greater than 7' we seem to be able to infer by existential generalization 'There is an x such that x is necessarily greater than 7'. But from this we can infer by existential instantiation 'a is necessarily greater than 7'. Some replacements of the constant V by names or definite descriptions will render this sentence true, others will render it false. Since the substitution of '9' makes it true, 'the number of the planets' should do so as well, since 9 = the number of the planets. But 'The number of the planets is necessarily greater than 7' is false. Modal contexts, then, restrict moves like quantifier attachment and substitution of identicals that are not problematical in nonmodal first order predicate logic. This by itself merely exhibits what may be certain peculiarities of modal logic that could be circumvented if there were advantages in doing so, for example, by giving the operator 'necessarily' multigrade status. Using the multigrade strategy, '9 is necessarily greater than 7' can be reconstructed as 'Nec ("&gt;" 9,7)'. This expression is to be read "'is greater than" is necessarily true of 9,7'. The modal sentence has now been expressed in a referentially transparent de re mode that allows quantifier attachment: 'There is an x such that ' "is greater than" is necessarily true of x, 7'. Because a certain object, purported "essence and all, happens to be the number of the planets" (cf. Quine 1977, 114), we may then substitute (still in de re mode) "'is greater than" is necessarily true of the number of the planets, 7'. Reformulating modal logic by means of the special semantic predicate 'is necessarily true of and quotation marks does allow us to sidestep the substitutional anomalies, albeit at the price of a certain loss of logical simplicity. But there is also a metaphysical cost, and one that is, in Quine's view, significantly higher. For quantifying into modal contexts commits us to an unwelcome essentialism, unwelcome because it requires us to ascribe to objects essential properties distinguishable from contingent ones only by way of privileged, but also referentially opaque, names and descriptions. Now it may seem that all that Quine's arguments accomplish is a piece of legerdemain, trading on a conflation of arithmetical statements and empirical statements, and sliding from a domain of abstract arithmetical objects to one of physical objects. What makes the statement 'The number of the planets is necessarily greater than 7' false is that the number of the planets might have been different from what it is. But the fact that there are nine planets is a physical fact, whereas the fact that 9 is greater than 7 is an arithmetical one. Quine, however, could hardly have been unaware of this. He just doubts that there are (or that we have © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="14">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 263 need of) any abstract objects possessing essential arithmetical properties; and he doubts that there are any arithmetical facts independent of linguistic specification. He may countenance sets in his ontology; but sets are defined purely extensionally by their memberships, and '9' refers to the same set of sets that 'the number of the planets' does. He does, however, also have a positive strategy for dealing with this objection. Logical necessity, he proposes, has to do with how an object is described, not with the object itself: "Being necessarily or possibly thus and so is in general not a trait of the object concerned, but depends on the manner of referring to the object" (1953b, 148). On this view, logical necessity is an artifact of language and does not pertain to the object of language. As a result, modal logic aids and abets a confusion of levels between object language and metalanguage, a kind of use and mention error (Quine 1961b): writing 'Necessarily 9 is greater than 7' is like mistakenly writing 'p implies q' instead of '"p" implies "q"\ A certain set-theoretical entity, when uniquely designated by the definite description 'the square root of 81', is necessarily greater than 7. That same entity, when uniquely designated by the definite description 'the number of the planets', is not necessarily greater than 7. Why, though, is the first not a "privileged description" that leads inevitably to the number essentialism Quine wishes to avoid? The response is that essentialism is dodged when the necessity opera tor is reconstructed as a semantic predicate. This metalinguistic strategy of reconstructing the necessity operator as a semantic predi cate is available in arithmetical and other formal contexts; but it is available only in formal contexts. We may say "'9 is greater than 7" is necessary' because '9 is greater than 7' is logically true, a theorem of set theory: As long as necessity in semantical application is construed as explicit truth functional validity, on the other hand, or quantificational validity, or set theoretic validity, or validity of any other well-determined kind, the logic of the semantical necessity predicate is a significant and very central strand of proof theory. (Quine 1953a, 169) A valid statement is one that is true by virtue of its structure, whether this structure is, as it is in propositional logic, strictly truth functional or whether it is something else, as in predicate logic or set theory. That is to say, when we predicate necessity of a valid statement, we know pretty clearly what we are talking about: a statement is valid and so necessary by virtue of a relatively well-understood set of formal rules and procedures, both syntactical (proof theory) and semantic (model theory). The same goes for the logical truths, which, for Quine, are consistent substitution instances of valid forms. And mathematical truths are logical truths, if logic is understood to include set theory. Where the criteria for predication of necessity are less well understood, as in traditional © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="15">264 CHARLES NUSSBAUM "analytic" statements, statements supposedly true because of the "meanings" of their terms, predication of necessity becomes problem atical. As Quine says dismissively, "Meaning is what essence becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word" (1951, 22). As we know, Quine has little fondness for such meanings. For him, all they amount to is a displaced essentialism. But why, according to Quine, is this essentialism such a bad thing? On this topic he is not always as helpful as he might be. Some of his remarks range from apparent ad hominems - "Necessity as a statement operator . . . leads us back into the metaphysical jungle of Aristotelian essentialism" (1953a, 174) - to statements that seem to beg the question - "But however venerable the [Aristotelian] distinction [between essence and accident], it is surely indefensible" (1960, 199-200). The legitimate complaint, however, seems to be this: essentialism amounts to a reintroduction of the analytic/synthetic distinction, but now in a particularly pernicious form. Essences are merely meanings or intensions ontologized, that is, intensions transferred from language to the object of language; and intensions are the mysterious entities upon which analyticity was found to depend. Modal logic in effect reintroduces a class of material statements (analytic statements) that are not strictly formal or set-theoretical, and that allegedly are necessary and remain true come what may, but now with an added metaphysical warrant. Such modal statements, moreover, are not amenable to the metalinguistic semantic strategy offered for arithmetical statements because of the dubious status of analytic statements. The status of the self-evident synthetic statements of the metaphysical tradition is more dubious yet. The analytic/synthetic distinction, modal logic, and essentialism, for Quine, make common cause in one unholy alliance. Essentialism also does not sit well with physicalism or with empiricism and experimental method. While essences, like meanings, are not easily individuated, physical objects, Quine thinks, "have their impeccable principle of individuation." But this principle has nothing to do with essences of any sort or with which expressions may be used to pick out such objects: "physical objects are identical if and only if coextensive," that is, if and only if they occupy the same place at the same time (Quine 1975, 101). Regarding empiricism and experimental method, essentialism historically has encouraged speculative "dormitive-power" explanations invoking the essential natures of things, and has discouraged empirically responsible observation of what objects actually do under controlled conditions, irrespective of how they are described.16 As we saw in earlier discussion of Kripkean miscrostructural essentialism, the only "essences" the objects of the basic sciences possess are their microstructures. But 16 Compare Popper's low estimation of the importance of explicit definitions in empirical science (1950, ch. 11, sec. 2). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="16">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 265 these are discovered empirically. If true, 'water is hydrogen hydroxide' is true in all possible worlds; but we could be wrong about this. Indeed, atomic theory itself could turn out to be false, unlikely though this is (Kripke 1972, 123). Microstructural essentialist claims, therefore, are falsifiable and have empirical content. In biology, where even microstructural (that is, genotypical) essences are much less useful than they are in physics and chemistry because they can be trumped by phylogenetic, morphological, reproductive, and ecological considerations in the determination of species identity (see Griffiths 1997; Kitcher 1984; Ridley 1986; Rosenberg 1985), there is wide agreement that essentialist thinking concerning the nature of species identity constituted for centuries a major blockage on the road of inquiry that led to evolutionary theory (cf. Plotkin 1993, 26). Essences are unchanging, but species are historical lineages that change through time because they are subject to a process of undirected variation and natural selection. And it must be said that while Aristotle himself seems in his actual scientific practice not to have been hobbled by an extreme version of metaphysical explanatory rationalism, the inherited Aristotelian conception of the ideal completed science, and most especially Aristotelian metaphysical biology, do exhibit the explanatory and causal rationalism referred to above that is so antithetical to natural science and its highly selective adherence to the principle of sufficient reason. None of these considerations concerning empirical science, however, speaks against essentialism in arithmetical and other mathematical contexts. Recall the two ways of designating 9, one yielding a necessary truth, the other a contingent one. We may, as Quine urges, reconstruct the modal necessity operator in the first case as a semantic predicate. But why should we? Why should we not regard being the square root of 81 an essential property of the number 9? The Quinean answer is that numbers can be reduced to sets in at least three ways (1964, 206); numbers, therefore, are (or need be regarded as) nothing other than sets of sets; and sets have no essences other than their memberships. This move confers some definite advantages. First, it allows us to avoid positing ontologically mysterious and epistemically problematic abstract arith metic objects: What are these things and how do we gain cognitive access to them? Why do they stand in the strictly necessary relationships they do? What exactly is strict necessity anyway? And second, it allows quantification over sets and their members in an extensionalist manner, while attributing strict necessity to statements about them by regressing into the metalanguage. To assert, then, that necessary relations like 'is greater than' subsist between numbers (qua sets of sets) is just to say that certain statements expressing these relations are necessary, that is, are logically true. Strict necessity properly pertains to statements, and not to the nonlinguistic objects of first-order statements, because linguistic items © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="17">266 CHARLES NUSSBAUM are rule constituted: necessary statements are what they are through compliance with syntactical and semantic rules.17 A similar line may be taken with regard to physical objects. Physical objects do, of course, possess (to some degree of approximation) numerical and geometrical properties. But if mathematical objects themselves can be set-theoretically reduced, so may these formal proper ties. If '9' refers to a set of sets, then to possess the property of nineness, as the collection of the solar planets does, is to constitute one of those sets. And just as necessity (other than membership) pertains not to sets but to the descriptions applied to sets, necessity (other than causal necessity) pertains not to physical objects but to the descriptions applied to physical objects. We may, then, cleave (with one qualification to be duly noted) to the view, Quinean in spirit if not in letter, that any necessity that is not causal necessity concerning the empirically discovered causal powers of things is determined not by the world but by the descriptions we apply to the world. Quantification into causal contexts is, however, not as straightforwardly problem free as is quantification into set-theoretical contexts. Causal necessity, unlike logical necessity, cannot be relocated at the level of linguistic description, since statements of causal laws, even if true, are not logically true. As a result, any attempt to implement a strictly extensionalist strategy with regard to statements of causal laws will reduce causality to regularity. But this, as Quine himself admits (1953b, 158-59), is unsatisfactory because mere regularity is not counterfactual-supporting. It is more than a little difficult to make sense of causal counterfactuals without allowing some talk of essences and possible worlds. But these essences need be nothing other than the empirically discovered causal essences to which we have adverted. Causal essences are minimally objectionable, for physical entities are reasonably held to possess the causal powers and dispositions they do irrespective of how they are described.18 Nor (absent phenomenalist approaches) can the objects of basic physics be ontologically reduced to another class of entities as numbers can be reduced to sets (cf. Quine 1964). The causal powers and dispositions of physical entities do in many cases (for example, the gravitational attractive powers of massive bodies) express themselves as definite physical quantities. If the acceleration constant near the surface of the Earth (g) equals the product of the Newtonian universal gravitational constant (G) and the mass of the Earth 17 I shall not attempt to address here Wittgensteinian skepticism concerning rule following and the ontological status of rules. 18 Cf. Follesdal (1965, 61, note 17): "It seems that 'causal essentialism' is better off than 'logical essentialism', since many arguments directed [by Quine] against the notion of logical [i.e., analytic] necessity (and thereby against logical essentialism) . . . have no counterparts for the notion of causal necessity. In fact, treating dispositions as inhering structural traits of objects is a form of causal essentialism; dispositional properties remain properties of the object regardless of the way the object is referred to." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="18">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 267 divided by the radius of the Earth squared, other values for the terrestrial acceleration constant are thereby physically excluded. This is what the physical value is causally determined to be. But nothing follows with logical necessity from a body's possession of such powers and dispositions until an appropriate numerical description is applied. This was the lesson of Quine's 'the number of the planets'. Once an appropriate description is applied, certain other descriptions will then apply (or will not apply) with logical necessity. The empirically discovered value of the terrestrial acceleration constant, when referred to as '9.80 meters I second (squared)is (logically) necessarily greater than 7.80 meters/second (squared) because of the formal relations between these physical quantities as thus described. Logical necessity, as opposed to causal or physical necessity, is properly understood as an artifact of language and therefore as rule constituted. The world, on the other hand, including the causal necessity in the world, can only be described, not constituted. The world discloses its causal workings to us if we interrogate it in the right way. The qualification referred to above is this: we need not, at least for the purposes of present discussion, follow Quine in withholding from the world the sort of metaphysical necessity19 that concerns the identity of individuals and of the natural kinds whose structural essences figure in their causal behaviors. First, it is not at all clear that this version of metaphysical necessity can be sharply distinguished from physical necessity, a point Kripke himself notes (1972, 164): water would not be hydrogen hydroxide if the laws of chemistry and atomic physics were not as they are. This is not to say that these laws are metaphysically necessary, true in all possible worlds. But it is to say that water could not exist in any possible world in which these laws did not hold. Second, Kripke's notions of rigid designation (which Quine was loath to accept, because he believed transworld identification to be unworkable) and necessary truth a posteriori support versions of essentialism and modal logic not vulnerable to Quine's critique. For Quine, the only intelligible construal of transworld identity exploits an analogy with the identity of this-world objects across their time slices. But such claims of object identity, he argues, are vacuous without specifying the predicates satisfied by the object in question (1976, 127). Momentary time slices of the silver dollar now in Quine's pocket are time slices of the same coin that was there an hour ago; but the later, scattered time slice of the four quarters for which that silver dollar has 19 In one place (1975, 233), Putnam seems to identify metaphysical necessity with logical necessity. His apparent motivation is that 'metaphysically impossible' and 'logically impossible' are coextensive expressions: both are without extension in all possible worlds. Nonetheless, such an identification seems ill advised, for logical necessity and metaphysical necessity remain different notions. While the negation of a logically necessary statement is a formal self-contradiction, the negation of a metaphysically necessary statement may not be. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="19">268 CHARLES NUSSBAUM been exchanged and the earlier time slice of the silver dollar also belong to another self-identical object, namely, the same dollar, "in one sense of the word" (125). Despite the air of sophistry, Quine means to demonstrate the weighty metaphysical difference made by the two predicates, 'is a silver coin' and 'is a dollar'. This later scattered time slice, in turn, belongs to an even more scattered physical object, the changing contents of Quine's pocket. Exactly which transworld objects, then, are identical to a given this-world object? And which this-world object are we talking about? The first question is particularly troublesome, for unlike the identity of this-world objects across their time slices, transworld identity affords no recourse to causal relations or to spatial contiguity and displacement in order to regiment the options. What we require, it seems, is a privileged (read essence-expressing), uniquely satisfied predicate; but this, Quine claims, is just a rigid designator (1976, 128), and talk of rigid designators and possible worlds is just a way of "waging the essentialist philosophy" (1977, 118). The Kripkean response is that the criticism and the analogy on which it is based are misconceived: Those who have argued that to make sense of the notion of rigid designator, we must antecedently make sense of 'criteria of transworld identity' have precisely reversed the cart and the horse; it is because we can refer (rigidly) to Nixon, and stipulate that we are speaking of what might have happened to him (under certain circumstances), that 'transworld identifications' are unproblem atic in such cases. (Kripke 1972, 49; emphases in original)20 I do not mean to suggest that Kripkean rigid designation is beyond all reproach. But if certain descriptions could be ruled out as legitimate substitutional terms in modal contexts because they are not rigid designators, then Quine's substitution problems would, as he himself recognizes, be significantly diminished. Quine was also traditional enough in his understanding of necessity not to consider necessary truth a posteriori as an option at all. His critique of modal logic depends, as we have seen, on assimilating necessity to analyticity, while identifying the analytic and the material a priori. Although this may point to a limitation in Quine's critique of modal logic, it does not present a problem for my account, because like Quine (and like Carnap and C. I. Lewis, the principal targets of his attack), the metaphysical tradition under consideration also identified the necessary with the a priori.21 Kripkean essentialism, whatever its virtues or its vices, is a doctrine quite distinct from the descriptionist essentialism I have criticized here, and Quine seems never to have taken seriously the causal theory of reference in any 20 See Lewis (1986, 217ff.) for further criticism of Quine's analogy. 21 Cf. Kripke (1972, 49): "The tendency to demand purely qualitative descriptions of counterfactual situations has many sources. One, perhaps, is the confusion of the epistemological and the metaphysical, between aprioricity and necessity." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="20">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 269 of its forms. "A rigid designator," he asserts, "differs from others in that it picks out its object by essential traits" (1977, 118). A rigid desig nator may pick out its object in this way, as 'the element with atomic number 79' does, but it need not. If the rigid designator is a name, and not a description, its reference can be fixed initially by means of a contingent trait, and by way of a description that is not uniquely specifying. Even a description that does not apply may be employed for reference fixation (cf. Kripke 1972, 106), provided it successfully directs attention to the intended object. In a straight baptismal naming situation, the reference of the name will not be fixed by traits or descriptions at all. Quine's arithmetic anti-essentialism, I have suggested, is considerably more attractive than his causal anti-essentialism. But even if we accept the former, surely the formal linguistic entities of which necessity is properly predicated in the metalanguage, including statements expressing the theorems of set theory, bear essences themselves and are not, as are numbers, susceptible to reduction. Revealing here is Quine's own distinction between the essential and the vacuous occurrence of a word in a statement: "A word may be said to occur essentially in a statement if replacing the word by another word is capable of turning the statement into a falsehood. . . . The logical truths, then, are describable as those truths in which only the basic particles occur essentially" (1981a, 2).22 In order to be a logical truth, a statement must exemplify a valid form, a form in which only the basic particles cannot be altered without changing the truth value of the statement. This, however, appears to support a (descriptionist) essentialism, etiolated though it may be; for the logical truths in a formal language can be picked out by a privileged description that, once used, cannot fail to refer, namely, the description given by Quine above. This description cannot fail to refer, because it is as much a prescription for logical truth as it is a description of the logical truths. But this is just to say once again that formal linguistic entities are rule constituted: that is why they must accord with Quine's privileged description (which incorporates the rule). In addition, any individual well-formed formula in a formal language will be rigidly designated by a name that, once used, cannot fail to refer, and that depends neither on empirical discovery, nor on ostension, nor on any baptismal event: the name of the formula is the quotation of that very syntactical string in the metalanguage. As we saw, rigid designators in contexts that are not rule constituted behave quite differently. 'Hydrogen hydroxide', if it refers at all, is a rigid designator; but it could fail to refer. Both a strong version of rigid designation and a (descriptionist) essentialism, it turns out, seem to be unavoidable in metalinguistic contexts. 22 In this passage Quine seems to be equating validity with logical truth. According to his standard usage a logically true statement is a substitution instance of a valid form. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackweli Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="21">270 CHARLES NUSSBAUM In natural language the situation is significantly messier, but not in principle different. Here the language contains its own metalanguage, and the syntactical formation rules and the semantic rules of truth-preserving inference are not explicit but implicit and are not easily disentangled (see Brandom 1994 for a magisterial treatment of these issues). It is controversial whether such rules are conventional in the David Lewis sense or to some extent set not by way of an intention to implement a regularity but by the weight of historical precedent (cf. Millikan 1998); or whether syntactical rules are literally encoded in the brain as language of thought theorists contend; or whether there is some combination of innatism and environmentalism involving an already primed brain possessing a massively parallel distributed processing architecture, which is then easily trained up to engage in linguistic behavior that can then appropriately be described as rule consulting.23 Natural language is further complicated by cases of syntactical ambiguity (amphiboly) and semantic ambiguity (syntactical forms that carry multiple contents). Fortunately, we need not enter further into these controversies and difficulties here. All we need do is hold onto Quine's original insights as they bear on strict logical necessity. (1) We understand 'necessary' perfectly well as a semantic predicate because it concerns validity and logical truth and is a "central strand of proof theory." (2) As we move farther away from contexts whose objects are rule constituted - that is, contexts like the metalinguistic one in which 'necessary' as a semantic predicate finds its proper place, contexts where (descriptionist) essenti alism is appropriate-we seem to lose any clear sense of what the criteria for application of the necessity predicate might be. But, as we soon shall see, the notion of a rule-constituted object can be broadened beyond linguistic contexts to include certain first-order contexts, that is, those in which the objects in question are not linguistic entities. Rule Constitution, Teleology, and Art Before we consider such cases of first-order rule constitution, however, let us first take note of a venue other than rule-constituted venues in which essentialism too is appropriate. Interestingly, that venue is also a first order context. I refer to the teleological context, the expression teleological now to be understood relatively narrowly as pertaining to human purposive making and doing. To explain the provenance of an artifact, we must essay a conjecture as to what its maker intended it to be; and this conjecture will involve the bestowal of an essence on the object. With regard to the object of this kind of explanation, how it is described 23 Compare Elman's account of the representation of grammatical structures in parallel distributed processing architectures (1992). © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="22">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 271 is decisive. An archaeologist who offers an explanation of how a humanly significant object came to be, say a tool, must, in her explanation, describe that thing as a tool of that sort; otherwise, the explanation will not be explanatory. Such a thing is, of course, a product of human action; and it is not irrelevant that similar considerations apply more generally to the explanation of human action by means of practical syllogisms. Like teleological explanations, reason-giving explanations are very sensitive to the action descriptions employed; otherwise the practical syllogism in question will not even be sound, much less explanatory (cf. von Wright 1971). With regard both to artifacts and to actions, certain descriptions are privileged. Although such explanations, employing intentional language as they do, tend to be referentially opaque, that need not be a problem for a physicalist, despite the fact that they are first-order explanations that refer to objects and events in the world. The reason this is not a problem is that they need not bring with them the ontological commitments concerning the physical world characteristic of descrip tionist essentialism. The physicalist ontology can remain determined, as Quine said it should, by the values of the bound variables of the quantified lawlike statements of the basic sciences. But that does not mean that the descriptions of the basic sciences are the only descriptions we might find useful, indeed indispensable, in understanding certain objects of experience. Other kinds of descriptions, for example those that require rationality assumptions, can turn out to be indispensable for understanding and even predicting certain very complex patterns of physical events, say human actions considered under the "intentional stance" (cf. Dennett 1987). But the employment of these descriptions need not land us in the "jungle of Aristotelian essentialism," because they appear in the laws of no basic science. Not all prediction, perhaps not even all legitimate explanation, need be nomological in character. Consider functional explanation in evolutionary biology, where the "design stance" is appropriate. The provenance of organ systems can be explained by adverting to their functions, and predictions concerning their behaviors can be offered. Unquestionably, hearts beat in contemporary human chests because hearts in ancestral forms carried out (often enough) the function of pumping blood. Moreover, there are robust predictions a functionalist theorist can make concerning the behavior of contemporary human hearts. These functional explanations and predictions must ultimately be discharged by the causal laws of chemistry, a basic science. But it does not follow that functional-style explanations are dispensable or scientifically illegitimate. Are functions "real"? Well, they are "real patterns," in Dennett's terminology (1991). But, like patterns of intentional behavior, they do not appear as the values of the bound variables of any unexceptionable quantified causal © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="23">272 CHARLES NUSSBAUM laws.24 In this way the (largely)25 extensionalist logic and the physicalist ontology that, at least at present, appear fundamental to scientific explanation can, in principle, be protected. We seem, then, to have isolated two contexts in which a descriptionist essentialism is entirely appropriate: second-order linguistic rule-consti tuted contexts and first-order teleological contexts involving human making and doing. And it is here that the promised connection with the modal and the teleological approaches to explanatory rationalism in metaphysics begins to emerge. To see it, we need only reverse the direction of Quine's dictum concerning meaning and essence: essence, we also may say, is what meaning becomes when it is divorced from the word and wedded to the object of reference. But essence is also what teleological significance becomes when bigamously wedded to the natural object while still properly joined in matrimony with the object of human design. And the rationalist metaphysical tradition of which we have spoken has officiated at many such nuptials: an essentialism that is appropriate with regard to what we have constituted or made is then projected anthropomorphically out onto the world, which we have not constituted or made. Let us now, as promised, move down from the second-order rule consulting constitution of linguistic entities and consider an example from a first-order context of rule constitution, say the construction of a religious artifact like a Christian cross.26 If we do, we shall be able to discern, as we did earlier in the case of metaphysical systems, a range of types among artifacts themselves. There are rules for the construction of a cross. It must satisfy certain essentialist criteria: it must consist of a vertical shaft with a shorter cross-bar that is located above the center of the vertical. Notice the modality of necessity that characterizes the preceding statements. But many things about the cross are left unspecified: material, color, exact proportions of the cross length, and precise placement of the horizontal can all vary from one individual to another. An artifact of this kind marks one extreme of a range of cases. While it is a teleological product, a product of human purpose and design, it is also tightly rule bound. Once it satisfies certain specific rules 24 It is controversial whether there are any laws of intentional psychology. But even those who think there are such laws grant that they are not exceptionless but ceteris paribus. See Fodor (1975) and Horgan and Tienson (1996). 25 Considerable difficulties beset any strict extensionalist logic of scientific explanation as regards the paradoxes of confirmation as well as the semantics of subjunctive and counterfactual conditionals. Classic discussions are those of Goodman (1983) and Scheffler (1963). 26 While such an object is unquestionably symbolic, it is not, like discursive language, denotational. In Goodman's parlance, it is exemplificational. Its status with regard to level of discourse is, therefore, ambiguous. Qua artifact, any reference to it is a first-order one; qua symbol, reference to it is second order. The same is true of nonlinguistic works of art. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="24">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 273 of construction, its other characteristics do not matter: they are contingent. At the opposite extreme, I suggest, we find those artifacts we call works of art. Works of art clearly are teleological products. Yet their design seems to evade all rule specification as well as all concepts of specific purpose. This, indeed, is their fascination: as Kant suggested, they follow no discernible pre-existing rule but seem to establish their own rules de novo, each work establishing a "rule" that applies uniquely to it and no other. But this is also, as regards our present issues of necessity and contingency, their unique strength. For the more purely rule constituted the product is, or the more narrowly specified its design concept, the more schematic and permeated with contingency it tends to be. As we move away from the schematic toward the other extreme of this range of cases, the distinction between aspects of the object that are necessary or essential and those that are contingent becomes less clearly defined. What is essential and what is not in an electrocardiogram tracing? In an abstract wallpaper pattern? In a Hokusai line drawing?27 As we enter the realm of the aesthetic, I suggest, what seems to happen is that more and more details become potentially essential. I say potentially essential, because as we move closer to the aesthetic extreme we lose any sense of rule-consulting determination or narrowly focused purpose: the object displays more and more what Kant famously called "purposive ness without a purpose." It allows, indeed encourages, a multiplicity of construals and interpretations. But as this happens, the details tend to become ever more inexhaustibly significant. Everything somehow takes on heightened significance, everything seems there for some reason and therefore not contingent. Our task, in interpreting the artwork, is to determine what this reason is, why each detail is as it is. In the successful work of art, and, I submit, only in the successful work of art, we have an object of human experience which in its own peculiar way satisfies the demands of explanatory rationalism,28 This, then, is the "inverted" Hegelianism of which I warned, inverted because it is art, and not metaphysics, that succeeds in satisfying these demands. The successful work of art holds out to us the promise of complete satisfaction of the principle of sufficient reason just in the sense that it promises the complete elimination of contingency in favor of necessity29 Yet it evades application of any specifiable logic of rules or definite design concept. A computational point may be helpful here. Any rigidly rule consulting system of production, say an algorithm implemented in a 27 These examples derive, of course, from Goodman (1976, 229). 28 Cf. Barrow (1991, 210): "No non-poetic account of reality can be complete." 29 Cf. Meyer (1956, 75): "The presumption that nothing in art happens without a reason and that any given cause should be sufficient and necessary for what takes place is a fundamental condition for the experience of art. Though seeming accident is a delight, we believe that real accident is foreign to good art." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="25">274 CHARLES NUSSBAUM digital computer, even one programmed to augment its own algorithmic base, is limited by the fact that the program must consist of a finite set of rules, however extensive. As a consequence, there will be a limit to the detail achievable in any design product of such a machine: there cannot be a rule to cover every detail, every eventuality. While a digitally produced design product can simulate a specifically targeted analogue product, often quite successfully, as digital musical recording does, it cannot be truly analogue or continuous.30 It will be in some way schematic, that is, some detail will be contingent, or not intentionally determined. (This may explain why some purists disapprove of digital musical recordings.) A work of art like a painting or a musical performance (not the skeletal musical score), on the other hand, exhibits a high degree of continuity and intentional determination of fine detail: the tiniest nuance of painterly line or impasto, or of musical emphasis, say the placement of a note in pitch or in time, or the quality of an attack or a release, can have enormous aesthetic significance. This kind of "density" (continuity) and "repleteness" (significance of detail), as contrasted with their opposites, "finite differentiation" and "attenua tion," are, as Goodman has suggested (1976, 252ff.), two pervasive symptoms of the aesthetic.32 This is not to say that a given work of art must itself realize complete continuity, whatever that might mean. The dots of a pointillist painting, for example, will be discrete entities.33 What counts, however, is not only what is present in the painting but also what choices are available to the artist, what moves are allowed by the syntax of the aesthetic symbolism in question. The pointillist painter is free to make her dots any shade of color and any size she pleases, just as she is free to place them anywhere she wishes on the canvas. This case, it should be evident, is quite different from that of a computer-generated dot matrix image. 30 Cf. Churehland (1995, 243): "So-called digital or discrete-state computing machines are limited by their nature to representing and computing mathematical functions that range over the rational numbers, as Pythagoras called them. . . . This is a potentially severe limitation on the abilities of a digital machine, because the rational numbers form only a tiny and peculiar subset of the continuum of real numbers. Therefore, functions over real numbers cannot strictly be computed or even represented within a digital machine. They can only be approximated." See also Port and van Gelder (1995, 40): "Precisely because discrete models are only an approximation of an underlying continuous one there are hard limits on how well the continuous function can be modeled." 31 The performance, that is, possesses certain densely ordered nuance properties not possessed by the musical work as specified by the score (cf. Raffman [1993, 113ff.]). 3~ Goodman's logical impossibility of finite differentiation of a dense scheme will include the sort of digital computational impossibility discussed in this paragraph, assuming the truth of Church's thesis. The psychological questions of whether, how, and to what extent a digital simulation of an analogue product may exceed specific human perceptual discrimination abilities and therefore may be processed by us as if it were dense are ones I shall not pursue here. On this issue compare Raffman (1993). 33 This counterexample was suggested by an anonymous referee for Metaphilosophy. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="26">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 275 We are now finally in a position to recur more adequately armed to the theological problem of evil. What metaphysical theodicy has tried unsuccessfully to do with regard to the real world, to solve the problem of evil by invoking the principle of plenitude and imputing to the world unified richness of compossible detail, a certain type of art, with its continuity and repleteness, succeeds in doing with regard to its imaginary "world." Art, as Stendhal says, offers us "a promise of happiness" (quoted with approval in Nietzsche 1969, 104-5). And the reason for this is really quite simple: the real world is not rule constituted by us, nor is it designed by us. The respective histories of successful scientific investiga tion and unsuccessful explanatory rationalism suggest that the world just refuses to cooperate with the kind of rationalistic metaphysics we have discussed. The best that the explanatory-rationalist metaphysician who abjures dualism and who wishes to respect physicalist scientific ontology can do34 is to identify the nomic structure of the universe with the divine reason, as Einstein reputedly identified the nomic structure of the universe with the "God of Spinoza," and as theistically minded physical cosmologists have attempted to do in more recent times. To do so, however, two crucial commitments of the Spinozist system must be forsworn, for the nomic structure in question is now the structure of descriptive scientific law. First, there are ho longer any grounds to claim that the cosmos is perfect or even "excellent" (Spinoza 1985, 458, 2, prop. 13, schol.), for without the principle of plenitude and Spinoza's allegedly self-evidently true axioms and self-evidently acceptable definitions,35 such judgments have no basis. 'Excellent' is a relative term for which there is in this case no comparison class; and in any case the ontological notion of grades of reality (of which perfection is the highest grade) makes no sense if torn from its Neoplatonic context. This, however, undermines any serious pretensions to establish a divine teleology on Spinozist grounds. Second, there is no basis to the claim that the causal laws of the "final theory" will be necessary and not contingent. To establish such laws as necessary, it would have to be shown that they could not be otherwise. It would be bumptious to insist dogmatically that this cannot be shown; but it is difficult to understand how an empirical theory relying on nondemonstrative inferences to the best explanation of empirical phenomena could do so, even leaving aside here the vexatious issues of underdetermination of theory by evidence and choice between non equivalent but empirically adequate theories. This serves to undermine 34 These conditions exempt from consideration panpsychist idealist theologies deriving from Leibniz, like those of Whitehead, Hartshorne, and other process philosophers. 35 According to Bennett (1984, 21), Spinoza did not claim that his axioms and definitions would be immediately self-evident to the philosophically untutored mind, but he believed that the comprehending reader of the Ethics would come to see them as the indubitably true beginning points they are. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Biackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="27">276 CHARLES NUSSBAUM the modal approach to explanatory rationalism. Once these points are admitted, little of Spinoza's Deus sive Natura is left. Not only do we seem to be unable to eliminate contingency from the world; thinking that we can do so diminishes our capacity to gain such legitimate knowledge of the world - namely, scientific knowledge - to which we do have access. An important lesson both of the classical positivist attack on the synthetic a priori and the subsequent Quinean attack on the analytic a priori is that such thinking historically has encouraged prejudices concerning issues that should remain sensitive to empirical evidence. But for this wisdom we pay an Odin's price: we must accept in our metaphysics an element of unexplained brute fact, a senseless surd that remains unaufgehoben, that scorns our attempts to see the world as a fully rational place, a place in which the evils we witness are justified as a necessary part of some splendidly inclusive whole. Yet it is the human need for just this kind of assurance that historically has driven explanatory rationalism, religion, and much Western art. Spinoza's amor Dei intellectualis, the transfigured states of religious mysticism so incomparably detailed by James in The Varieties of Religious Experience, the exaltation that under the right circumstances accompanies the experience of a certain type of art, are the results of attempts to satisfy this human need. To be sure, art comes in many varieties, and with a variety of effects, including stimulation, surprise, amusement, assuagement, and delight. I most emphatically do not claim that all art in all times and places is of a piece. But the art to which I refer, and which includes much of the Western art held near and dear, has the power to evoke emotions that display remarkable affinities to religious emotion, the hallmark of which seems to be a feeling of absolute dependency on something much greater, wiser, and better than we are, a mentality that sees into every nook and cranny of our souls and that wants only the best for us. Here is an excerpt from one of James's many memorable passages, one that brings out with particular force the affinities between religious and aesthetic emotion. The following religious vision, he tells us, was related by a woman who had taken ether for a surgical operation: A great Being or Power was traveling through the sky, his foot was on a kind of lightning as a wheel is on a rail, it was his pathway. The lightning was made entirely of the spirits of innumerable people close to one another, and I was one of them. He moved in a straight line, and each part of the streak or flash came into its short conscious existence only that he might travel. I seemed to be directly under the foot of God, and I thought he was grinding his own life up out of my pain. Then I saw that what he had been trying with all his might to do was to change his course, to bend the line of lightning to which he was tied, in the direction in which he wanted to go. I felt my flexibility and helplessness, and knew that he would succeed. He bended me, turning his corner by means of my hurt, hurting me more than © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="28">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 277 I had ever been hurt in my life, and at the acutest point of this, as he passed, I saw . . . He went on and I came to. In that moment the whole of my life passed before me, including each little meaningless piece of distress, and I understood them. This is what it had all meant, this was the piece of work it had all been contributing to do. I did not see God's purpose, I only saw his intentness and his entire relentlessness towards his means. (1985, 392n.; emphases in original) The similarity between this description of God's relentless use of his "means" and the artist's relentless use both of her materials and her audience is, I think, unmistakable. Indeed, the parallels in this passage with the effects achieved by tragic literary artists are particularly pronounced. For these seem to be not the traditionally received effects of catharsis and purgation but ones of triumphant mastery: the mastery of the senseless and the darkly irrational through a kind of clarity of insight. It is not suffering, Nietzsche points out (1969, 68, 162), that humans cannot bear; it is senseless suffering. And the hallmark of tragedy is a certain rationalization of suffering, suffering rendered somehow meaningful and understandable. The details all fit in with the whole, the senseless surd is eliminated, and contingency is vanquished by necessity.36 This is what is deeply satisfying about it, why we wish to submit to it, just as the surgical patient gladly submitted to being deeply hurt by God: she felt herself bathed in the light of a "promise of happiness," suffused with an emotion bearing some resemblance to Nietzsche's love of the "sweetness and plenitude [Fuelle] peculiar to the aesthetic state" (1969, 111). The literary artist brings this experience about in her readers or audience by means of a twofold teleology: the internal purposiveness of the actions of her characters, and the overall purposiveness of the structure of the literary work itself. If she has mastery of her materials, she, Godlike, will convince us that "she will succeed"; any clumsy manipulation will ruin the effect, will suggest not divine ordinance but a deus ex machina. The teleology of the artwork, however, must resist our understanding, not give itself away too easily, just as the rich web of coherent purposes we wish to find in the world resists us; but unlike the 36 Cf. Scruton (1974, 247-48): "In daily life our sense of what is appropriate must be held in abeyance, and only in the enjoyment of art is it allowed total freedom. In art everything that occurs is deliberate and reasoned; art presents us with a world entirely circumscribed by human intention." Cf. also his 1997, 76: "The causality that we hear in the musical foreground is therefore the 'causality of reason', which for Kant was the ground of human freedom. It is all the more easy to hear this 'causality of reason' in music, in that the world of physical causes-the 'causality of nature'-has been set aside, discounted, hidden behind the acousmatic veil. In music we are given an unparalleled glimpse of the reality of freedom; and because, as Kant reminds us, reason deals only in necessities, we hear the free order of music as a necessary order." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="29">278 CHARLES NUSSBAUM real world, the purposiveness of the artwork must not endlessly baffle and frustrate us. This is what we ask of the work of art, that it not require of us the profound act of faith required of a religious believer. "Whoever not only says, but feels 'God's will be done,'" says James (1985, 285), "is mailed against every weakness." When in the thrall of a certain kind of aesthetic object, however, we all are "mailed," as it were, if only for the moment. This kind of aesthetic experience, then, is, at least in one respect, an artfully induced illusion: the world of the work is not the real world, but, by skillful combination of commission and omission, of arrangement of structure and detail, the artist can give us the experience of what a little piece of a world under divine ordinance might be like. Moreover, once we have had the experience, we may be able to see aspects of the real world in something of a new light. But such aesthetically motivated interpretations of the world remain various and pluralistic: were they to be taken as making truth claims, they would often be found mutually inconsistent. Because of this, it is inappropriate to regard them as subject to truth conditions. Truth, unlike aesthetic significance, is unitary, if it is properly understood as a semantic property of declarative sentences; and the truth predicate is univocal, even if we grant that it must be relativized to particular languages, languages that are, however, in principle inter translatable. Rationalistic metaphysics is not aesthetic interpretation: it makes truth claims, and these claims are deeply anthropomorphic. The world, it tells us, is arranged in such a way that it is in its essence congruent with the phenomenology of human mental life; it is congenial to human aspiration. It is as if it were made or constituted by a being like us. This, I have argued, is an illusion. Whether the anthropomorphism of religion is an illusion as well I am not in a position to say. I shall, however, venture this observation: If religion is an anthropomorphic illusion, rationalistic metaphysics is a much deeper one. For, understandable as the motivation behind it may be, the rationalistic metaphysical tradition has tended uncritically to take human phenomenology and folk psychology as highly reliable guides to the ontological structure and the furniture of the universe. It has thereby institutionalized this anthropomorphic cosmic view within rational practice itself, characteristically positing an ontology of essences that are mere hypostatizations of the intensional objects (meanings) of human awareness. It may seem that these claims fit "revisionary" metaphysicians like Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz less well than they do a "descriptive" metaphysician like Aristotle, to borrow Strawson's familiar distinction.37 This, however, is not the case. The descriptive metaphysi 37 It hardly needs pointing out that Strawson's descriptive metaphysics does not map onto what I have termed "descriptionist essentialism." Strawson also counts Kant as a descriptive metaphysician. © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="30">AESTHETICS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 279 cian, we recall, attempts to articulate the "conceptual scheme" we already use, while the revisionary metaphysician aspires to provide a better one. But better in what way? Consider what criteria of explanatory adequacy revisionary metaphysicians historically have adopted. It would be foolish to maintain that empirical adequacy is the sole explanatory virtue; but revisionary metaphysicians have not, in the main, accorded it a particularly high value. Rather, the criterial principle, whether implicitly or explicitly, has been an explanatory rationalist version of the principle of sufficient reason, either in its modal or in its teleological formulations, or in some combination thereof; and the principle of sufficient reason as exploited by revisionary metaphysicians has been profoundly influenced by human phenomenology and folk psychology. Claims of impossibility purportedly resting on what is inconceivable and repugnant to reason have repeatedly shown themselves to be driven by failures of human imagination. Principles held to be necessary and self-evident have yielded to empirical pressure and have either been rejected or have undergone modification of status. Claims of scientific explanatory incompleteness allegedly resulting from insufficient rational warrant have been based covertly on criteria more at home in teleological, reason-giving contexts than in causal-explanatory con texts.38 Such claims have derived from a natural human tendency to revert to the intentional and design stances when the resources of the physical stance are unable to satisfy explanatory rationalism's fine grained standards of intelligibility. To the extent reasons do play causal roles in explanations of human behavior, as opposed to normative roles in contexts of justification and interpretation, they are instantiated as psychological entities, that is, beliefs, and belong to intentional or folk psychology. If it is to be successful, explanatory folk psychology must deal with the special difficulties of individuation and reference concerning intentional mental content, that is, meanings. It must also make sense of mental content's causal efficacy. I hold no brief, here, for eliminativist designs regarding folk psychology. But whatever its status as explanatory empirical theory, folk psychology should not simply be handed the metaphysical keys to the kingdom. As regards the contribution of rationalistic metaphysics to the solution of the problem of evil, our main topic here, its influence also has not always been beneficial. For it has tended at least to mute one of the powerful effects of religious conviction: if the believer is convinced that there is an underlying moral order in the universe, but also that we have 38 Torrance (1981, 70) provides a good illustration of this kind of thing: "[T]heology . . . is bound to treat the material content of any purely scientific account of the universe as a partial, provisional, and revisable cosmology which can never be completed or therefore explained merely in terms of its own constituent relations but which, on its empirico theoretical level, can nevertheless be highly meaningful for theology when it is coordinated with a higher level of rational order in God as its creative and sufficient reason." © Metaphilosophy LLC and Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2003</page><page sequence="31">280 CHARLES NUSSBAUM no cognitive access to it, bringing about such an order can be seen as a task that is set for us. That is, the hidden moral order can be interpreted, as Kant suggested it should be, not as gegeben but as aufgegeben. But this is to see the moral order of the universe not as a theoretical object but as a practical ideal. If, on the other hand, we think this order to be a possible object of cognition, a part of the essence of the world, something to be known rather than something that must be brought about through our efforts if it is to be realized at all, we shall perhaps be less inclined to strive toward this end by effecting changes in the world. We may even be tempted to use essentialism to reify ingrained prejudices and preconcep tions concerning the ontological and moral status of other humans, animals, and the natural world itself, prejudices and preconceptions that might otherwise be amenable to reformation. To the extent the world is moralized by us, it is, if not made by us, at least remade by us, for the practical rules and principles we adopt have causal consequences. Once rationalistic metaphysics and theology lose their grip, we may be less inclined to see the ideal objects of morality (the right and the good) as given or imposed and more inclined to see them as constituted by the practical principles we adopt. In this way, essentialism and theodicy can be said to find their proper places and assume their proper functions as disguised practical ideals. For here an anthropomorphism is entirely appropriate. We may or may not have been created in God's image; but when we moralize the world, we recreate it in our image.
