<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUSICAL CONSONANCE AND DISSONANCE: A CULTURAL CRITERION NORMAN CAZDEN It is generally believed that the materials of music, when analyzed and re- duced to fundamentals, are determined by demonstrable natural laws; that is, by the laws of mathematical proportion, by acoustical phenomena, by the physiology of hearing, by the psychological processes of perception. From this assumption it follows necessarily that the foundations of musical art are static, that they are valid for all times and places. The hypothesis is prominent even among those musicians concerned with innovation in creative music. This view is inadequate as an explanation of historical change in musical art. For it is not possible that laws which are themselves immutable can account for the profound transformations which have taken place in musical practice, and are now taking place. Among the important materials of music which have been declared subject to universal and eternal laws are the combinations of tones-intervals and chords-classified as consonant and dissonant combinations. Tone combina- tions taken in isolation can be said to present numerical ratios in the vibration frequency of their constituent tones. When these ratios are abstracted and considered as numbers, there is a certain correspondence between mathematical simplicity of ratios containing low numbers and musical consonance, and be- tween mathematical complexity of ratios containing high or incommensurable numbers and musical dissonance. In a philosophic sense, it is hard to decide what is meant by "simplicity" in this case. Abstractly speaking, the ratio 7r: 1 or 2: I is quite as simple and elemental, for example, as the ratio 2:1. Speculations of this nature have led to a kind of number magic, the mystery of the "harmony of the spheres." The composer Hindemith places his faith in "the electronic flux of a single tone and the proportions of its overtones." Despite its poverty in metaphysics, the mathematical formulation of conso- nance cannot be readily dismissed. There is an actual connection between the proportional lengths of a string and the musical intervals produced. The musical tone possesses overtones in a harmonic series, whose vibration fre- quencies are simple multiples of the frequency of the original tone. The prom- inence of the first six overtones is said to cause musical consonance. Here are their ratios to each other, with the equivalent musical intervals: 1, ratio 1:1 unison C-C perfect consonance 2, ratio 2:1 octave C-c perfect consonance 3, ratio 3:2 fifth c-g perfect consonance 4, ratio 4:3 fourth g-c' perfect consonance 5, ratio 5:4 major third c'-e' imperfect consonance 6, ratio 6:5 minor third e'-g' imperfect consonance The order of preference for musical consonances is likewise held to correspond exactly with this series; the lowest overtone ratios accounting for the best con- 3</page><page sequence="2">4 NORMAN CAZDEN sonances. The laws of harmony are therefore to be derived from the ratio 1:2:3:4:5:6, corresponding to an extended major chord, the "chord of nature." The aesthetic beauty of the common major triad is accounted for by the ratio 4:5:6. The accepted musical consonances of the major sixth (ratio 5:3, as g-e') and the minor sixth (ratio 8:5, as e'-c") fit readily into the same plan. The science of music has been "reduced" to the study of acoustical wave-forms. Study of the physiology of hearing has demonstrated the importance of simple ratios not only in the production and transmission of vibratory wave-motions producing sensations of sound, but in their effective reception as consonances by the ear. Consonance has been described as the absence of disturbing beats in aural sensation; these beats being increasingly present when vibration fre- quencies are in complex ratios. The transformation of vibration ratios into perceptual consonances must involve more than the receptive mechanism of the ear. The psychology of perception has been called upon to explain how certain objective wave-forms transmitted through the ear produce the subjective response called consonance. Speculative discussion and highly organized experimental investigations have resulted in the postulate of a "consonance sense" dependent upon such perceptive qualities as smoothness, purity, blending, fusion, and combinations of these. If these criteria are effective determinants of the consonance response, they unfortunately do not agree in their predictions. Moreover, they are at variance with the orders of preference prescribed by the overtone ratios, as well as by commonly accepted musical usage. One reason for the difficulty has been an initial assumption of distinct sensory atoms in perception. Even in the study of judgments of isolated intervals, pure tones have been consistently used-tones which may have a laboratory value, but which are not found in music. Musical perceptions do not arise from tones, they arise from structural relations among tones. The relations cannot be uncovered by observing and measuring response to isolated interval-qualities. The procedures hitherto used have sought at best a mystic "noumenon" which may be termed "psychological consonance of tonal isolates." Though much effort has been wasted in philosophical blind-alleys, studies of the psychology of musical perception have produced important negative results regarding consonance and dissonance. The naive view that by some occult process mathematical ratios are consciously transferred to musical perception has been rejected. Fusion, or "unitariness of tonal impression," has beenfound to produce no fixed order of preference for intervals, with the remarkable excep- tion of the octave. It has been discovered that individual judgments of con- sonance can be enormously modified by training. Perceptions of consonance by adult standards do not seem generally valid for children below the age of twelve or thirteen, a strong indication that they are learned responses. A musical interval consists of two tones, but in addition it has an interval- quality whose characteristics cannot be reduced to those of the constituent tones. For instance, the interval retains its quality when it is transposed, that is, when two other tones are taken in the same relation. Beyond this level of "fifthness" and "major-thirdness" of intervals lie the relations among intervals and chords. The science of harmony is a study of these relations.</page><page sequence="3">MUSICAL CONSONANCE AND DISSONANCE 5 In musical harmony the critical determinant of consonance or dissonance is expectation of movement. This is defined as the relation of resolution. A consonant interval is one which sounds stable and complete in itself, which does not produce a feeling of necessary movement to other tones. A dissonant interval causes a restless expectation of resolution, or movement to a consonant interval. Pleasantness or disagreeableness of the interval is not directly in- volved. The context is the determining factor. Frowned upon as a merely aesthetic distinction not readily demonstrated by scientific analysis and measurement, the variability inherent in the resolution relation has been undoubtedly troublesome to systematic minds. But what is more important, it makes necessary the recognition of what has for the most part been ignored by students of musical materials, namely, the cultural context. For the resolution of intervals does not have a natural basis; it is a common response acquired by all individuals within a culture-area. It becomes evident that the science of music is not primarily a natural science. It is a social science devoted to the properties of a musical system or language belonging to a specific culture-area and a certain stage of historical development. There have been attempts to explain resolution on mathematical or psycho- logical grounds. Calculations have been devised which purport to show how an interval "ought" to move. It transpires, however, that because of such "dis- turbing" structures as tonality, intervals move quite otherwise in musical prac- tice. Such procedures can only result in increasing perplexity. The tools are inadequate for data which are social in nature. The natural law hypothesis does not provide a correct description of the usage of consonance and dissonance in music. The discrepancies involve data that are Systemic, that is, the actual conditions of musical usage; Historical, that is, the changes in attitudes towards consonance and dissonance in various periods within the history of western music; and Comparative, the use of consonance and dissonance in cultures other than western. In music, single tone-combinations are treated as consonances which are acoustically and perceptively harsh and disagreeable because of spacing or register. Contrariwise, certain undeniably pleasant sounds may be clearly treated as discords. For example, the major triad C-E-G taken in the "great" octave has been variously described as harsh, muddy, growling. Clashing of its prominent overtones may be demonstrated. Beethoven concludes the first movement of his Piano Sonata, opus 2, No. 3, on this chord. On the other hand, chords such as EEb-Eb--g-f#'-bW or D-A -f#-c-e played softly sound not only pleasant but cloyingly sweet. These chords have however active tendencies, they create expectations of movement, and are therefore dissonant. Due to the tonality relation, probably the most powerful systemic structure in our musical culture of the past few centuries, the most familiar consonant harmonies may act as dissonances. The "chord of nature" itself, the C major triad, is a dissonance in the key of F; that is, as the dominant harmony, it re- quires resolution to the tonic. The requirement is a psychological imperative resulting from our conditioning; it has no basis in the nature of tone. The origin of the minor mode and the minor triad in the overtone series has puzzled musical theorists for centuries. The ratios involved are, to say the</page><page sequence="4">6 NORMAN CAZDEN least, rather more complicated than those of many "dissonances." The methods devised to make them appear simple and comparable to those of the, major harmony depend upon incredible gymnastics reminiscent of the Ptolemaic epicycles. The most common argument is that the minor triad is perceived as th inversion of the major triad. Musical response, however, suggests nothing s strained and indirect. The minor harmony is accepted as frankly consonant, and as fundamentally so as the major. By recognizing the social data of a musical language, this issue is most easily solved by a simple definition derived from musical practice. The consonant harmonies are the major- and minor triads, and to a lesser extent their first in- versions. These are normally stable, inactive, or complete. All other har- monies are dissonant, or active, unstable and incomplete, and require eventual resolution to the major or minor triads. This does not end discussion of the problem of the minor; it states the known facts. Musical notation partly indicates that intervals may be identical in sound and yet either consonant or dissonant according to their contexts. Enharmonic identity, a seeming anomaly, provides distinctive names and notations for the same tones, corresponding to their stable or active function. Fairly rational rules of "spelling" distinguish F# from the acoustically identical Gb. This reflects our perception of F#, in relation to C, as an augmented fourth resolving by expansion, while the Gb in relation to C is heard as a diminished fifth re- solving by contraction. In combining these different intervals into the abstract tritone, which has no existence in musical response, acoustical, physiological and psychological studies applied to equally-tempered intervals have left these relations out of account. Not only direction of resolution but expectation, and consequently consonance or dissonance, may be represented by the apparently fictitious enharmonic notation. The augmented second, as c--d, is a clear dissonance and acts as such, though in isolation it is equivalent acoustically to the minor third c-eo. The same is true of the diminished fourth c#-f and the major third db-f. What seems in atomic studies an anachronism of the worst kind is therefore historically correct and logical in our present diatonic system. Musical notation, of course, does not exist independently of the system in which it functions. Given the premise of certain suggested techniques such as the twelve-tone system and others, enharmonic notation would indeed be a con- fusing, irrelevant and outworn misrepresentation. So completely is a tonal combination perceived in its systemic context, that considerable acoustic alteration does not destroy interval qualities. Variability of intonation, which may be regarded as a phenomenon opposite to the en- harmonic notation, is due only in very small measure to a psychological threshold of discrimination for small differences. Equal temperament, our current prac- tice of deliberately mistuning every musical tone, has produced no essential change in the perception of interval qualities. The tempered major third, which is acoustically most badly out of tune, functions as the basic consonance in our system of harmony. Where untempered intervals are possible, as in string quartet and unaccompanied choral music, rather than use acoustically "pure" intervals the skillful musician will produce thirds still more out of tune,</page><page sequence="5">MUSICAL CONSONANCE AND DISSONANCE 7 in order to emphasize the major-minor contrast. Perceptual values of intervals make possible quick adjustment and identification of melodic and harmonic groups from their contexts, even for example in music played on pianos badly out of tune. In the fixed evaluation of degrees of consonance predicated by the overtone series, the most perfect consonance, after the unison or identity, is presumably the octave. Now "octaveness" as a response of striking similarity between tones of different pitch is a remarkable perceptive phenomenon. Undoubtedly that response has its origin in an unusually clear relation of overtones, and perhaps physiological processes of audition as well, since its parallel is not found in vision. Yet in music the octave is not as good a consonance as, for instance, the major third. It has been described as empty and dull, not particularly pleasing, though not displeasing. Resolution of a dissonance to a simple octave is not quite satisfying, it produces a sense of omission of expected consonances. The octave, in fact, is not really a consonance at all. It brings no harmonic relations into music, it possesses no tendencies that produce distinct expectations of either stability or instability, of activity or inactivity. In terms of harmonic properties the octave is neutral, neither consonant nor dissonant. It is a euphonious relation indeed, but of exactly the same order as the unison, and for exactly the same reason-its unusual perceptive fusion. It is used for sonority rather than as a harmonic consonance in terms of resolution. Musicians call octaves "doubling." Like the octave, the perfect fifth in our musical system is noncommittal in respect to resolution tendencies. It notably lacks definition of major or minor quality, important to the harmonic scheme; consequently it sounds "thin." Single or repeated fifths, like octaves, may act as neutral sonorities, as "drones," as reinforcements of overtones. If treated as having harmonic implications, successions of fifths are objectionable. Instead of being accepted as consonances, their amorphous neutrality causes a dissolution of tonality organization. Hence the notorious prohibition of such successions in the rules of harmony. Octaves and fifths, then, are not in reality consonances within the meaning of harmonic relations. They appear in musical languages which do not have har- mony in our sense. And they enter into our musical system as equivocal and neutral isolates, as sonorous embroidery. The remaining "perfect consonance," the fourth, is actually a dissonance in musical practice; and what is worse, not consistently so. By intricate math- ematical reasoning it has been argued that the fourth is a derived interval, in that it is present in the low regions of the overtone series but not in direct re- lation to the fundamental. This is however true also of the major and minor sixths, which are unmistakable consonances. Ratios can hardly be expected to explain both the dissonant and "consonant" use of the fourth. The variation is clearly due to context. Such factors as the influence of rhythm on harmonic motion and the active tendencies of certain degrees of the scale, generally ignored in procedures concentrating on tones in atomic isolation, play a decisive role in this complex response. The fourth under certain conditions acts as a scale-degree dissonance in that it seems to de-</page><page sequence="6">8 NORMAN CAZDEN mand resolution to the third. On an accented beat the fourth, and its super- structure the chord of the six-four, act as suspended dissonances requiring resolu- tion. When the fourth does not appear as a scale relation, or when it is not taken in relation to the bass, or when the six-four chord is not accented, it becomes a "resultant" doubling of neutral quality. While the overtone series posits degrees of purity, it does not account for the normal musical division betwen the "perfect" and the "imperfect" consonances. Moreover, if we consider musical response, acoustic evidence to the contrary, there is a decided preference in our musical system for harmonization in major and minor thirds and sixths. These intervals have a definite quality of consonance in musical structure and function. Our more myopic scientists have gently overlooked this fact as being merely a question of aesthetic beauty. In terms of the resolution relation, it is easy to see why there should be a sharp opposition between consonance and dissonance in musical practice. An interval or chord either requires movement or is the final result of movement. Per- ceptively this reaction overshadows mere differences in degree of pleasantness or harshness of isolated tone-combinations. Resolution polarity is the basis, for example, of many common musical effects such as hesitancy, suspense, deceptive cadences and the like. Any tone combination, however acoustically "pure" in isolation, instantly falls into the category of a dissonance when its position calls for motion: for example, an ordinary major triad on the dominant harmony before a full cadence; an octave when it occurs on the leading-tone of the scale; a chord, or even a single tone, on an upbeat. Polarity of consonance and dissonance is therefore one form of the general dialectic opposition, the thesis and antithesis of relationship among tones, which is the chief characteristic of our musical system. Resolution polarity belongs with the opposition of tonic and dominant in the tonality relation, with the contrast between major and minor qualities, with the opposition between rhythmic accent and relaxation, as a dynamic structural element in music. No synthetic determinations of a "natural" order of preferences for conso- nances, whether founded on simplicity of ratio, prominence of overtones, absence of beats, or perceptive purity and the like, can hope to account for the complex tonal relations which form our musical language. "Natural" derivations cannot indicate where the threshold between consonance and dissonance should be, they cannot even account for the existence of the polarity. And indeed, the dividing line is a subjective one. It has undergone noteworthy historical change not easily attributed to natural causes. It is created in each individual by his adoption of the musical system or language response of his culture-area. Re- actions to consonance and dissonance do not originate on the level of the prop- erties of tones, but on the level of social communication. That perceptions of consonance and dissonance are conditioned by culture rather than by objective or human nature implies that they must be subject to observed historical change, and to variation in accordance with the musical systems of different culture-areas. The teachings of historical and comparative musicology are consistent with these criteria. In the musical system of ancient Greece, there were no "imperfect" con-</page><page sequence="7">MUSICAL CONSONANCE AND DISSONANCE 9 sonances. Major and minor thirds and sixths were considered dissonant. The fourth was the basic consonance for the formation of modes and systems of tetrachords. Early medieval organum also showed a decided preference for the fourth. Since some music of this period has survived and is occasionally performed, one can easily observe the extent of the change in attitudes by the expressions of distress which modern audiences exhibit. During the 11th century, apparently, the preference for the fourth gave way to an increasing and almost exlusive use of fifths and octaves. In the period when our modern musical system came into existence, with its dependence on tonality and the major and minor modes, thirds and sixths became consonances and fourths dissonances, the full triad replaced the empty neutrals, and the functional value of resolution crystallized. The new tonal gravitation, for example, produced in the elusive six-four chord a dissonant cadence function. In music since the turn of the 20th century, increasing use has been made of neutral fourths and fifths, as well as of the supposedly dissonant sevenths and ninths, for purposes of "harmonic color," a significant term which may be translated as sonority of isolated acoustic combinations, of the same order as the older organ mixtures. The tonal system, in spite of the alarm of conservatives, has not thereby been destroyed or endangered. The traditional rules of consonance and dissonance are merely not applicable to such use of neutral euphonies. More fundamental change is certainly possible. Avoiding the anthropomorphic tendency to see the particular features of one's own cultural usages as the universal and eternal norms, we must grant that real and integrated systems of music other than our own can and have existed, are and were satisfactory and pleasing to their users. The "natural harmonic sense" is seen to be dependent upon historical and cultural setting. Some theorists and historians have indeed attempted to rationalize the change in attitude towards intervals by a sort of teleology. The overtone series, it has been claimed, presents the "true" natural harmonic laws towards which all systems are in- stinctively groping. Such mysticism is not substantiated by the historical information now available. It may be assumed that musical structures not common to all known musical systems cannot be inherent in the nature of music. Harmony itself as we understand it is not a necessary element of music. It is the product of the western diatonic scale system alone, and is a relatively recent arrival. Resolution is a criterion that has no application to the pentatonic scales. That is one reason why, to our perceptions, Chinese music sounds so inconclusive, so lacking in tendency and definition. The acoustically "perfect" consonances are the rule in some musics, but are not inevitable foundations, for nothing close to the ratio 3:2 is found in certain Javanese and Siamese scales. Intervals which bear no resemblance to any in our diatonic system form melodies which to their users seem "instinctive" and self-evidently natural. Harmony in seconds, which we would consider flagrantly dissonant, seems to be practiced in the South Sea Islands and elsewhere. In the Icelandic "Tvisdngvar" the third appears to be treated as a dissonance. It could hardly be maintained that the natural laws presumed to determine harmony vary thus geographically</page><page sequence="8">10 NORMAN CAZDEN in their application. Nor would anyone today attribute fundamental differences in music to variation, apart from cultural influences, in the physiology or psy- chology of human beings. In comparatively recent times the role of group experience in the creation of a common musical language has been overshadowed by the emphasis on intuitive individual imagination. The 19th century called up a concept of the romantic composer dreamily communing with his inspiring muse in a strange and beautiful world of sound located somewhere in the stratosphere. By some weird miracle of genius he managed to transmute his celestial fruits into a ripe and ready mundane form that just happened to fit snugly the musical habits of his neighbors. That lonely portrait is being slowly left behind us. The social group produces not only the anonymous folksong and the traditional music whose origins are long untraceable; it brings into being the conversational musical currency which one individual can speak and another understand. Musical structures arise from common experiences, and thus they acquire the functional associations of which musical meaning consists. The neat and logical formulations of the natural sciences have little bearing on musical consonance and dissonance. The predictions of mathematical ratios, acoustic phenomena, beats and isolated perceptive qualities are consistently ignored and contradicted in musical practice. For the evidence called upon by natural science has been inadequate. It has left out of account the decisive historical and cultural factors. The data relevant to a description of music are primarily social. Sound waves and perceptions of sound are not music, they are its objective media. Spoken language also uses the medium of sound, but the laws of language structure and meaning cannot be deduced from that raw material. Perceptions of interval qualities, though they do not arise on natural founda- tions, are neither arbitrary nor accidental. They are conditioned responses derived from the structural relations of a specific musical language and its history. In western music of the past few centuries, consonance and dissonance are the poles of a relation of resolution expectation. We recognize them because this relation exists in all the music we have heard. Structurally, one might say grammatically, consonance and dissonance are the polar forms of stability- instability, completeness-incompleteness, passivity-activity. This polarity is parallel and interlocked with other prominent features of our musical language: tonality (tonic-dominant), modality (major-minor), rhythm (relaxation-tension). In this broader sense, resolution may be described as the dialectic structure of our musical language. Thus the materials of musical art are not to be discovered in natural phe- nomena taken in isolation, in tones and the responses to them, but in the more complex systems of tonal relations which are the historical products of human culture. These systems cannot be reduced to their constituent elements without losing their essential properties as organized wholes, and without losing their human content. In the course of development of a system, certain of the infinite number of possible tones are selected, organized, integrated. Historical forms of musical structure are developed which acquire the nature of laws. Tonal relations become stylized, artificial vehicles for associations which have</page><page sequence="9">MUSICAL CONSONANCE AND DISSONANCE 11 meaning for human beings. Significant change in a society, such as dramatic infusion from other cultures, may fundamentally alter a system. The isolated tone, interval or chord is a subsidiary abstraction given meaning by its systemic context. The organized systems of tonal relations are human rather than natural products. Their fate is determined by the history of music, by the social environment of music. They are for that reason peculiarly subject to change. Speculations and experimental investigations have some effect on the internal development of music. Individual theorists have had and will continue to have a role in molding, systematizing, interpreting, rationalizing the system in use; sometimes in spinning questionable philosophical terraces on its basis, or in distorting that system on grounds of pseudo-scientific hypotheses. Musical science, while taking due account of the relevant physical disciplines, is essentially a social science. It is a branch of the study of human culture and history. Significant changes occur because of social needs. The natural phenomena of vibratory wave-motions and their reception by the ear may be seen as a limiting, rather than as a determining, factor in the perception of consonance and dissonance. The most that can be said about their application is that they are a negative influence. Natural laws exercise control over the direction of musical practice only by providing a range beyond which musical materials can progress only with increasing difficulty, or beyond which their progress would have no corresponding real meaning. Such would be, for ex- ample, scales that ignored the octave ratio, tones beyond the physiological limit of perception, or minute intervals below the average threshold of aural discrimination. That these limits are no great handicap, and therefore of no great import, to the free range of musical art is manifest from the remarkable variety of practicable systems of music that have been used and proposed. The historical causes of changing patterns in a musical system areproblems still awaiting adequate investigations of a social nature. The laws of acoustic perception, like the laws of gravitation to which they have been frequently attributed, provide us with no comparable mutations. Cultural criteria, the fluctuations within a society, diffusions from without, technological improve- ments, new methods of musical production and distribution, institutional forms such as the concert hall and the symphony orchestra, church music, music at public functions, use of text and dramatic and choreographic adjuncts, have played an important role that has not been effectively recognized as applicable to the form as well as the content of music. The revolution in medieval musical practice, for example, seems to have resulted from the pressure of secular in- fluences upon the learned music of the ecclesiastic "art forms," as well as from infusions from extra-European sources. The difficulties in the study of consonance and dissonance dissolve as soon as we realize that these qualities are not inherent in perception as such, but are learned responses, adaptations to an existing pattern of the social group. His- torical movements, changes in the social function of music, and not the harmony of the spheres, control and direct transformations in musical structures. It is suggested that where radical innovations in our musical system are proposed their real basis be sought in the needs of humanity, in the cultural movements of our historic time.</page></plain_text>
