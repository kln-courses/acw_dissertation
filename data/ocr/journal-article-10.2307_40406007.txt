<plain_text><page sequence="1">Not By Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker. John O. Reiss. Berkeley, CA: UC Press, 2009. 440 pp. ISBN 978-05-202- 5893-8, $49.95. Georges Cuvier served as one of the founders of vertebrate paleontology in the 19th century, and yet he is often viewed as an example of stubborn orthodoxy during an era that heralded significant new milestones and insights regarding evolution and the history of life on our planet. Frequently lauded for his anatomical expertise, Cuvier's holistic view of organisms as integrated functional systems led to his legendary ability to predict the form and function of entire species from extremely meager samples of fossil remains. Although he was instrumental in establishing the reality of extinction of species and in developing the concept of stratigraphy using index fossils, he strongly resisted the emerging theories of organic evolution and "transformism," arguing that any small, random change in physiology or morph- ology would disrupt the delicate balance that allowed an organism to function and, ultimately, to survive (Rudwick 1997). Reiss, however, suggested that Cuvier's principle of "conditions for existence" has been misunderstood by generations of evolutionary biologists, including Darwin himself, and actually forms a critical founda- tion for an accurate understanding of evolution. He presented evidence that Darwin's natural selection is based upon an unnecessary analogy to an intelligent designer, in which "the achieved result of the evolu- tionary process is seen as a previously vacant place in the economy of nature" (p. 353). Cuvier's principle of conditions for existence of life, however, avoids this downfall by rigorously maintaining the connection between existence and adaptation, whilst Darwin decoupled the two phenomena, "since without this separation, the species would have gone extinct before it could adapt to the new environmental conditions" (p. 133). Even Alfred Russell Wallace is cited as initially recognizing and resisting the teleology inher- ent in Darwin's language in On the Origin of Species, although later in his career his refusal to accept human evolution led him into his own brand of teleological explanations (Shermer 2002, pp. 229- 231). In contrast, Cuvier's principle of conditions for existence states that any organism must already be satisfying its conditions for existence, by virtue of the fact that it does indeed exist in order for us to observe it. Consequently, the idea of organisms being "selected" for some hypothetically superior state is unnecessary and misleading. The issue of teleology in Darwin's theory has been the subject of vigorous debate amongst both scientists and philosophers. Darwin addressed the issue with his contemporary critics, dismissing accusations of teleology and anthropomorphism as "superficial objections," that took his metaphors too literally and citing chemists' discussion of atomic "affinities" as another example of harmless literary language in scientific discourse (Darwin 1859 [1872],</page><page sequence="2">724 Book Reviews in West-Eberhard 2003, p. 443). Reiss's thesis, how- ever, is that Darwin was unable to completely eliminate the implication of design from his concept of natural selection, due to the pervading influence of 19th century British natural theology in his upbring- ing and professional training. Darwin's view of variation as being caused by imperfect adaptedness resulting from environmental change resulted in the concept of selective "force" working to "sort out proper structure and adapt it to change" (Notebook D, Barrett et al. 1987, pp. 375-376). In Not by Design, Reiss integrates two long- contentious issues - Cuvier's role in the development of evolutionary theory, and inherent teleology in Darwin's concept of natural selection - into a wide- ranging review of the development and progression of our understanding about both the principles and the mechanisms of evolution. The unifying theme throughout the text is that Darwin's ideas were heavily influenced by Paley's teleology, and that Cuvier's ideas are a more appropriate, non-purposive way to view evolution. He supports Darwin's natural selection as one mechanism of evolution, but rejects it as an interpretive principle. The book is divided into four parts: an overview of the philosophical background and terminology which is used to discuss issues of teleology, selection, and determinism; a comprehensive review of the historical debate and diverse ideas regarding evolution and creation, ranging from Epicurean atomists to modern times; a thorough evaluation of how the development of mathematical population genetics models during the Modern Synthesis was also influenced by ambi- guity between overall adaptedness and existence; and an extensive examination of how Cuvier's principle of conditions for existence can strengthen the under- standing and discourse about a comprehensive list of topics relating to adaptation and evolution. Reiss achieves both breadth and depth, as he meticulously sorts through various definitions of common terms and concepts that have been interpreted and devel- oped in divergent or conflicting ways within the scientific community. He suggests in the preface that some readers may choose to skip the middle chapters of the book, which center upon the technical details of various models in population genetics. Those that are less than mathematically inclined should not be deterred; Reiss takes care to insert boxes with summaries of the relevant equations and derivations, and the overall analysis developed in these chapters contributes greatly to a full engagement with the ideas and arguments in later chapters. The purpose of the book is to build the case that Cuvier's principle of conditions for existence is a unifying concept in evolutionary biology, and that Darwin's and Wallace's natural selection functions as a "conservator of adaptedness" (p. 309) by explaining the persistence of traits within a population, but not as an active, driven force for change. Reiss differ- entiates between the concept of natural selection as a mechanism of evolution, in a probabilistic sense, versus its use as a "principle of interpretation" for our understanding of the process of evolution (pp. 280- 284). In his efforts to root out teleological implications from evolutionary discourse, Reiss delves into thought-provoking examinations of a range of issues. His discussion on the difficulty of assigning conflicting roles to natural selection and genetic drift includes an exhaustive overview of the many sources of random change in populations. There is a thorough review of the many ways in which the terms "adap- tation" and "adaptedness" are used, and Reiss also builds a case to show that simple functional signifi- cance is often misconstrued as selective "force." He concludes with a section on conservation, discussing how our concepts of genetic load, genetic quality, and fitness have strong implications for management of declining populations. Although much attention is devoted to rates of population growth, Reiss does little to address the specific mechanisms involved in differential repro- ductive success. Phenotype can influence reproductive success in a variety of ways, including sexual selection, rate of maturation, patterns of fecundity, and other life-history traits (Cornwallis and Birkhead 2008). Reiss's argument would have benefited from a more inclusive coverage of these phenomena. Instead, he tends to focus his discussion on the functional significance of traits related to pure survival, and most reproductive issues are relegated to mathemat- ical models. Another weakness is that although he mentions research into the "evolution of evolvability," the discussion lacks a review of more current research in this field (Landry et al. 2007; Wagner 2008). Not by Design is valuable for its meticulous coverage of the historical foundations of modern thought about natural selection, speciation, and a myriad of topics relevant to research in evolutionary biology. Reiss does not claim to be promoting a novel and original idea, but simply to shed light on the need for clear definitions, vigilance about teleology, and efficient communication about ideas, both within the scientific community and with the public at large. Regardless of whether one agrees with Reiss about either the degree to which teleology clouds Darwin's theory, or the role that Cuvier's principle of condi- tions for existence ultimately plays in evolution, this</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 725 volume is a valuable review of both historical and current evolutionary concepts. Not by Design is an engaging read and is sure to stimulate much-needed discussion about the details of current evolutionary concepts.
