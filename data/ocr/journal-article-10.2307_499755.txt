TSCHAN, Pennsylvania State University NECROLOGY William Abbott Oldfather. - The world of the Classics has lost another of its champions in the person of William Abbott Oldfather. Born on October 23, 1880, in Urumiah, Persia, where his father was a missionary, and a graduate of Har- vard in the Class of 1901, he gave his whole life to the study and the teaching of the Classics. His work in Lokris started him in a career of scholar- ship which encompassed the entire field of Greek and Roman Literature, History and Culture, and of Greek Archaeology. His devotion to sound scholarship became a cult with Oldfather, and his contributions not only to American but also to European publications, such as the Pauly-Wis- sowa-Kroll Real-Encyclopaedie, did much to en- hance the reputation of American scholarship at home and abroad. At the University of Illinois for more than three decades he taught the Classics, that for him were a living, driving force, and his enthusiasm and scholarly approach opened up the realm of real scholarship to a great number of young, eager students, whose contributions to American learn- ing have already become significant. In him they found not only an inexhaustible source of learning and inspiration, but also a real life-long friend, ever ready with sound advice and open-hearted help; a teacher, who taught the meaning of life not only in the classroom, but also in the activities of everyday life; in the stacks, but also on the athletic field, in hikes and in his ever-open home. Indeed, his harangues and lusty songs by the camp fire became a legend at Illinois, and will long be re- membered by all those who shared with him not only the classroom but his life. His devotion to duty, his steadfastness and ability for hard work, set the pattern for the life of many of his younger colleagues, to whom he proved a real ovvaiSahqeoS. It would take too long to enumerate the books and articles which bear his signature, but it must be stated that they are characterized by sound scholarship and great practical value. His indices and bibliographies to Apuleius (1934), Cicero (1938), Epictetus (1997), and Seneca (1918), provided the pattern for such endeavor and a key to the better use of these authors to innumerable students. His Lokrika (1908), forms not only ai basic work of the region, but also a model to be followed in the study of any region and its litera- ture. In the numerous publications of his students. the latest of which, entitled Studies in the Text Tradition of St. Jerome's Vitae Patrum, appeared in 1943, are reflected his patient methods, his mastery of the field and his great scholarship. For years he and his students have been compiling a Bibliography of the contributions of American scholars to Classical studies. The project was motivated by the desire to prove the immense contribution to scholarship of Americans and by the hope that such a monument, to work ac- complished, would serve as a further incentive to the coming generations of scholars for greater endeavor and ever higher achievement. Because of his great work Oldfather was recognized as one of the most outstanding Classical scholars of America, a leader in his field, whose teaching not only at Illinois, but also at the University of Cali- fornia (Sather Professor, 1934), at Columbia Uni- versity (1938), at Athens, Greece (1937) and else- where has inspired younger scholars everywhere, and has helped to raise American scholarship to the high level it now occupies. In the passing of William Abbott Oldfather on May !6, 1945, the world of scholarship has lost one of its most inspired Hierophantes, and all those who were associated with him a great Master and a real Friend. Alcovia )1 lvllpl. G. E. MYLONAS Kurt Richard Valentin Miiller, born in Berlin on September -3, 1889, died in the Bryn Mawr Hospital on October 17, 1945, after a brief illness. He was a scholar of exceptionally thorough train- ing and wide reading, with unusual powers of memory, combining to make of him a teacher able to draw on the resources of his profession to a degree rarely equalled among our generation of archaeological scholars. He had studied at four of the leading German universities under such teachers as Wilamowitz and Leo in classical philology, Eduard Meyer in ancient history, and</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 173 Kekul6, von Salis, Pfuhl, and Wolters in classical archaeology - a list of great distinction, to which he added Loeschcke as his most intimate master and friend. His professional career took him from the post of assistant in the Archaeological Seminar in Berlin to be for two years a Teaching Fellow at the German Archaeological Institute in Rome, brought him back to Berlin as Privatdocent for six years and a.o. Professor for two, and finally led him to Bryn Mawr College in America, where for fourteen years until his death he was Associate Professor of Classical Archaeology. In due course lie became an American citizen; and it was from Bryn Mawr and Philadelphia as centers that he made his many professional acquaintances and friends and with the most unfailing kindliness and the gentle eagerness which were characteristic of his temperament dispensed to all seekers from his astonishing fund of information. Since he never asserted himself or his learning, only those who thus tested him could appreciate how thoroughly he had made himself master in his chosen spe- cialty in the interrelations between the Oriental and Mediterranean cultures, in which he had first made his mark with his well-known Friihe Plastik in Griechenland und Vorderasien, pub- lished in Germany in 1929. Though he never revisited Europe, he was an indefatigable traveler, adding Alaska and Mexico to his field of ar- chaeological interest and visiting Central and South America and New Zealand. Wherever he wandered he made, in his quiet way, friends al- ways and never enemies. "NON FUI: FUI: NON SUM: NON CURO," he chose to be the motto on his gravestone. R. C. Edward Kennard Rand.--In the sudden death of Professor E. K. Rand, of Harvard Uni- versity, on October 28, 1945, in his seventy- fourth year, the United States has lost her leading Latinist, and Harvard one of her most beloved figures. Born in Boston on December 20, 1871, he was graduated from Harvard College in the Class of 1894, of which he was elected permanent Secretary on graduation, and in which capacity he served until his death. This meant much to Rand, and he was on the closest and most devoted terms with his classmates at all times. His Class Reports, which appeared regularly every five years, are considered models of their kind. A devout com- municant of the Episcopal Church, and the son of a minister, he was torn in his mind on leaving Col- lege as to whether he wished to assume the career of a scholar, or take Holy Orders; and in the year after his graduation he enrolled in the Harvard Divinity School, receiving the degree of A.M. in 1895. From 1895 to 1897 he taught at the Uni- versity of Chicago, but, being still in doubt, he returned to Cambridge in 1897, and spent a year at the Episcopal Theological School. He then decided against the ministry, and went to Europe to study, receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Munich in 1900. While there, he worked un- der Furtwiingler, Wilfllin, and, above all, under Traube, through whose inspiration he began his own epoch-making researches in Latin palae- ography. In 1901, after his marriage to Miss Belle Brent Palmer, who survives him, he returned to Harvard as an Instructor in Latin, being promoted to Assistant Professor in 1905, to Professor in 1909, and on the death of Professor Clifford H. Moore in 1931, to Pope Professor of Latin. He became emeritus in 1942, but went as Senior Fellow to Dumbarton Oaks for the year 1943-44. His service at Harvard was interrupted three times. In 1912-13 he was Annual Professor at the School of Classical Studies of the American Acad- emy in Rome, which he served later as a Trustee, and of which he was made a Life Member; in 1919-20 he was Sather Professor at the University of California; and in 1933-34 he was Exchange Professor at the Sorbonne. Honorary degrees were conferred upon him by Manchester University, Glasgow University, Trinity College in Dublin, Western Reserve University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard, this last being given just before his retirement. From France he re- ceived the Legion of Honor, and from Italy the Order of the Corona d'Italia. He belonged to numerous Learned Societies both in this country and abroad, and was a past President of the Amer- ican Philological Association and of the Mediaeval Academy of America. Of his enormous bibli- ography, the books that are best known are Ovid and His Influence (in the Our Debt to Greece and Rome series), In Quest of Virgil's Birthplace, and The Building of Eternal Rome, his last book. This may seem to be the career of a philologist, rather than of an archaeologist, but his interest in archaeological studies and research was profound and appreciative, as many of his pupils can testify. He was a loyal member of the Institute in its Boston Society, and was honored with a Life Membership on his retirement from teaching. He lectured frequently before many of the Societies of the Institute, and, during his year in Rome, entered into the archaeological activities and</page><page sequence="4">174 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY investigations which were available for foreign scholars. His love for his country, and his belief in her mission in the world were mainsprings of his character. Although over age in the First World War, he went through the Military Training course for older men at Plattsburg, N. Y., and at the time of the Armistice had been for some time in a civilian capacity in the Military Intelligence Division in Washington. Had the war lasted a lit- tle longer, he would have received a commission as a Captain in the Officers' Reserve Corps of the Army. But his was no narrow patriotism. He believed with all his heart in international coiper- ation, supported the League of Nations, and was eager to see the United States assume what he felt to be her proper role in international affairs. Many of his nearest and dearest friends could not go as far as he was willing to go, and were in disa- greement with many of his conclusions, but they never could question the sincerity of his motives, or his intellectual and moral integrity. To his arguments, as to his scholarly research, he brought a trenchant yet kindly wit, a disarming urbanity, and the convinced tolerance of that rarest of individuals-the cultivated man of the world, who is in no sense a worldly man. Next to his love of country came his love for Harvard, his Alma Mater, whose Faculty he so long adorned. He had a profound respect for Academic ceremony. A man of great natural dignity, he rejoiced in the brilliant wardrobe of his numerous Honorary Degrees, and his Latin orations at various Harvard Commencements, and above all at the Harvard Tercentenary in 1936, will not readily be forgotten. He believed that it was a Professor's duty, not only to instruct youth, but to lead and guide public opinion; hence his patriotism was served by his academic convictions. And we have spoken above of his love for his College Class, which was abundantly returned by his classmates. The writer of this tribute is proud to have been his pupil and friend. To his pupils he embodied the ideal of what a scholar should be-learned, am- bitious, brilliant, humane, but above all, unself- ish. He gladly renounced his part in any piece of research in favor of some student who would and could carry it through to its conclusion; and he did it without any jealousy or rancor. Best of all, he was what so many great scholars are not-a born teacher, inspiring, and capable of imparting his enthusiasm to his students. It was truly said of him that he could make the dullest subject interesting, and the most interesting sibject a flaming torch in the pursuit of learning. The purity of his character, and his simple, trusting faith as a Christian, were as natural to him as the breath he drew. He took a great interest in the religious life of the student body at Har- vard and Radcliffe, and never hesitated to help, out of the abundance of his own spiritual re- sources, those of them who were in doubt, af- fliction, or distress. He served his parish church on its Vestry, and brought to it his best in counsel and strength. It is small wonder, then, that to many of us who sat under him it is as though we have lost not merely a beloved teacher and friend, but a Father. S. B. L. German Casualties.-Information has reached the Editors of this JOURNAL from relia- ble sources that GERHART RODENWALDT and his wife committed suicide at the time of the Russian entry into Berlin; that HEINRICH BULLE lost all his possessions when Wiurzburg was destroyed, and died shortly thereafter; and that JOHANNES SIEVEKING lost his life in an air raid on Munich. The contents of the Museum at Wtirzburg are said to have been hopelessly destroyed. Further report, not thoroughly confirmed, gives the deaths of KARL ANTON NEUGEBAUER, ERICH A. PERNICE, and ROBERT ZAHN. The causes and dates of the deaths of these men are not at present known. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS European Art Collections and the War. - Continuing her account of the fate of private collections at the hands of the Nazis (for a sum- mary of the first part, see AJA. xlix, 1945, p. 585), GLADYS E. HAMLIN, in College Art Journal iv, pp. 209-212, reports on the discovery, partic- ularly by the United States Seventh Army, of the hideouts in Southern Bavaria and Austria where this looted art was deposited. The collections of which these objects were part are listed. The "clearing house for Nazi loot" was the castle of Neu-Schwanstein, in which not only treasures, but records and correspondence, were found. A number of the more important works of art that passed through this place are named. Goering's own private collection of masterpieces and jewels was captured near Berchtesgaden in a special train. Other works stolen by him were in an air raid shelter. Goering's agent (who was captured) claimed that he "paid for each object," but was</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 175 evasive as to where the money came from. Other works of art "bought" by Hitler, Frank, and even Quisling, are listed. Of the public museums in anti-Axis countries, it is reported that the au- thorities removed their treasures early, and, barring Naples, no great losses have been made known; but this may not be so true of the Ger- man museums, owing to Nazi overconfidence. The problem now is to "unscramble" the hideouts of objects from private collections, and to restore them to their rightful owners. Changes in Metropolitan Museum.- FRANCIS HENRY TAYLOR, in his Annual Report as Director of the Museum (Annual Report, MMA., 1944, pp. 11-13), speaks of the future plans to divide the collections into several sub- Museums. As at present envisaged, they will be: (1) The Museum of Ancient Art (Egypt, the Near and Middle East, Greece, and Rome); (2) the Museum of Oriental Art (Islam and the Far East); (3) the Picture Gallery; (4) the Museum of Deco- rative Arts; (5) the American Wing, which will be adjacent to the Whitney wing of Modern American Art. Since this report was written, the new architectural plans required have appeared in the New York papers. Ibid., pp. 15-28, in con- junction with HORACE H. F. JAYNE and LAU- RENCE S. HARRISON, he gives a list of accessions during the year 1944, mahy of which are illus- trated, and others of which have already been published in the Museum's Bulletin and elsewhere. A list of the Museum's formal publications in 1944 is also given (ibid., p. 32). The Acanthus.-In BMMA. n.s. iii, 1945, pp. 248-252 (3 figs.), HILDEGARD SCHNEIDER discusses this plant, from whose leaves the Corin- thian capital is derived. The plants used in an- tiquity and the Middle Ages as sources for this capital were Acanthus spinosus or Acanthus mollis, usually the former. There are some twenty species all told, most of which are native in the Mediter- ranean region. At the Cloisters, of which the writer is Head Gardener, two acanthus plants are kept growing, but they are not the true species; the Acanthus mollis is the variety longifolius, while the Spinosus has no spines except on the leaflets of the flowers. The true plants are not available in the United States, and even these varieties are not hardy north of Virginia, the specimens at The Cloisters having to be potted and kept indoors in winter. They are all peren- nials, and the usual blooming period is from the end of May through June. Most interesting is a photograph of the Acanthus mollis longifolius growing against a background of mediaeval acan- thus capitals at The Cloisters with strikingly similar leaves. Keltic Temple. - The Boston IIerald for November 30, 1945, reports from London that excavations for wartime airfields have often yielded important archaeological discoveries. This was especially true in the case of the Heath Row airfield in Middlesex, where a Keltic temple of a kind and date never before found in Britain was brought to light. The pottery discovered goes back in some instances as far as 500 B.C., showing the antiquity of the site. There is evidence of a re- building in the Romano-Keltic style, as masonry of this type was also found. EGYPT Problems in Egyptian Chronology. - The as- tronomical data contained in the Kahun Papyri are utilized by LYNN H. WOOD in a brilliant piece of research to demonstrate that the xIIth-Dy- nasty king in whose seventh year a heliacal rising of Sothis occurred on the sixteenth day of the eighth month is identical with the king in whose thirtieth year a new moon occurred on the twenty-sixth day of the tenth month, and that this king is Sesostris III. The date of his accession is fixed as I Thoth (Dec. 6), 1879 Julian; that of Amenemhet I, founder of the xIIth Dynasty, as I Thoth (Jan. 3), 1991 B.C. (BASOR. 99, 1945, pp. 5-9). In the same issue of the Bulletin, pp. 9-18, W. F. ALBRIGHT discusses the chronology of the xIII-xvth Dynasties. Yantin-'amnu (Egn. Antin or Entin), king of Byblus, is shown to be a con- temporary of both Zimri-Lim of Mari (now dated ca. 1730-1700 B.C.) and Nefer-hetep, the twenty- first member of the xiiith Dynasty, for whom a. date ca. 1740-1729 is proposed. The discovery of a relief of Nefer-hetep at Byblus makes it impos- sible to date the beginning of the Hyksos occupa- tion of Lower Egypt before the end of his reign. In the thirty-year period before the establishment of the xvth Dynasty, ca. 1690, Albright places the early Hyksos rulers such as 'Anat-har, Ya 'qub- har and Samuqena. Salitis, founder of the xvth Dynasty, seems to have overrun all of Egypt at the time of Dede-mes (the thirty-sixth king of the xiiith Dynasty) who is probably to be identified with the Timaios of Manetho (see p. 15, n. 44). It is now known that the xvth Dynasty lasted about 108 years. On the basis of Wood's and Edgerton's</page><page sequence="6">176 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY researches the end of the xiith Dynasty is fixed at 1778 B.C. Amarna Letter from Ugarit. -In BASOR. 95, 1944, pp. 30-33, W. F. ALBRIGHT calls atten- tion to the fact that since the excavations at Ugarit (R s Shamrah) it has been recognized that perhaps four of the preserved Amarna letters came from there. Of the tablets in question, four are in Berlin, one (in two fragments) in Cairo. These tablets agree in script and clay, and all were written by Canaanite scribes. The letter in Cairo bears a name found in a Hittite letter which can be dated ca. 1370 B.C. "The five letters now as- signed to an Ugaritic origin are all so broken that they are not very instructive," but we may con- clude that since trade with Egypt was very profitable, Egyptian allegiance was more popular than Hittite in Ugarit, and that the rulers of Ugarit did everything they could to propitiate the Pharaohs. Late Egyptian Sculpture. -In The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, vii-viii, 1944-45, pp. 39-59, GEORGE STEINDORFF catalogues twenty- one fragments of sculpture now in American col- lections, several in the Walters Art Galley, most, if not all, of which come from the ruins of two temples partially constructed during the reign of Nektanebos ii, the last king of the Thirtieth Dynasty. They are the temple of Onuris-Shu at Sebennytos and the temple of Isis at Behbeit el- higara. The reliefs, in reddish and gray granite, for the most part " represent religious ceremonies, performed by the king before the deities. .. ." MESOPOTAMIA Iraq.-In IRAQ, Supplement 1945, TAHA BAQIR, curator of the Iraq Museum, gives a sec- ond interim report on the Iraq Government excavations at 'Aqar Qfif. These excavations were made in a preliminary season (1942) and again from February to March, 1943; the third season lasted from Oct., 1943 to Feb., 1944. Four main levels in the palace area contain more or less good clues for dating. The top levels (I-A, I-B, I-C) repre- sent the reigns of Kassite kings from Kurigalzu IIn to Marduk-apla-iddina I. Level II belongs to the period of Kudur-Enlil and Kashtiliash, and it must be said quite definitely that the occurrence of tablets of Kudur-Enlil and Kashtiliash in a chance deposit, which does not happen to include Shagarakti-Shuriash, is not yet proof that he did not reign between them. The oldest pavement at Level Iv is associated with Kurigalzu I. Accord- ingly, the foundation of the city would be dated at the beginning of the fifteenth century B.C. The text is illustrated with twenty-seven full- page plates. Sumerian "Paradise" Myth. -The first of a series of Supplementary Studies planned by the editors of the BASOR. is devoted to a new edi- tion of the myth published by Langdon in 1915 under the title of "Sumerian Epic of Paradise, the Flood, and the Fall of Man." Although later studies revealed that the myth had nothing to do with the Flood or the Fall of Man, the text pre- sented so many difficulties that its interpretation has remained uncertain. The new editor, SAMUEL N. KRAMER, has succeeded in clearing up many problems and presents us with a transliteration, translation and commentary which far surpasses any previous work on the subject. The myth begins with a picture of the idyllic state of affairs prevailing in the land and city of Dilmun (lo- cated by the editor in southwestern Persia near the Persian Gulf; see notes 9 and 28). This region is a paradise where neither sickness nor death is found. The divine activity which has led to this blessed state is then described. The sun-god, Utu, provided it with fresh water. The flooding of the ditches is attributed to the urinating (?) of Enki, the water-god. (Is the reference to the ac- tion of the tide in the Persian Gulf? Dr. Kramer thinks the author is describing the origin of the marshlands bordering the Gulf). The vegetation of Dilinun, symbolized by eight plants, arose after the impregnation of a series of four goddesses by Enki, beginning with his wife Ninhursag and ending with his great-granddaughter Uttu, a goddess who has some connection with vegetation. Before cohabiting with Enki, Uttu makes him present her with a gift of some fruit and vege- tables, which Enki obtains from one of his wor- shippers. Their union is followed by the springing up of the eight plants. But the plants are dis- covered and eaten by Enki, as a result of which he is cursed by Ninhursag and begins to pine away. The cunning fox brings about a reconciliation between Ninbursag and Enki and the latter is revived and provided with eight healing divini- ties. Although the editor does not suggest it, the poem seems to possess the characteristic features of a fertility myth. May not the eight plants symbolize the eight months of vegetable growth? The demand of Uttu for a gift before union with Enki serves to emphasize the rBle of offerings in ensuring fertility. Kramer appends to his study a</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 177 very important excursus on Sumerian lexicology and lexicography in which attention is drawn to the deficiencies of the Sumerian lexicons. Sumerian Statuette. - MAURICE S. DIMAND publishes, in BMMA. n.s. iii, 1945, pp. Z53-~256 (3 figs.), a large statuette in the Metropolitan Museum, found at Tell Asmar, near Baghdad, by the expedition of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. It is that of a bearded man, is carved of gypsum, and is dated at the be- ginning of the third millennium B.C. Together with other figures found at the same time, it exemplifies an early school of Mesopotamian sculpture. It is obviously Sumerian. The temple in which it was discovered was founded before 3000 B.C., and remained in use till about 2500 B.C. It was dedicated to Abu, god of vegetation and fertility. Most of the statuettes found are those of worshippers, the male figures being apparently of a Semitic, non-Sumerian, type, but it is possible that they represent priests or officials, as the cos- tume, a simple skirt with a fringe, is the garment of the early Sumerian period. The position is strictly frontal and massive. The statue in New York is intact, except for the legs and feet, which are missing. Dilmun, Land of Living. - Under this title, S. N. KRAMER, in BASOR. 96, 1944, pp. 18-28, discusses the probable location of this "place where the sun rises," first made known by Poebel's publication of the "deluge" tablet. Various places have been suggested by different scholars. It must obviously be sought east of Sumer; but it must also be south of Sumer, and therefore in the southerly part of western Iran, that is, somewhere south of Elam. Dilmun is proven by texts to have been noted for its cedars, which were considered holy by the Sumerian poets. For added confirmation for the location of Dil- mun, a section of the Sumerian epic "Gilgamesh and Huwawa" is translated, showing that Gilga- mesh journeyed in search of immortality to a " Land of the Living," a land of cedars, whose "creature" is the sun-god Utu, all of which is particularly applicable to Dilmun, and points thither as the land to which he went. In order to reach it, Gilga- mesh had to cross seven mountains, which are mentioned in other texts as south of Elam. Thus the Sumerian Land of the Living is proved to be in Southwestern Iran, with its western boundary along the eastern shore of the Persian Gulf. In the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, the Elysium is left unnamed, but as the source-material seems to have been almost certainly Sumerian, it was probably Dilmun, and in the same location. Old Babylonian Pay-List. - ALBRECHT GOETZE publishes, in BASOR. 1944, pp. 18-24 (fig.), a tablet at Yale, probably, although not cer- tainly, from Larsa, dating in the eighteenth century B.C., listing payments to labor gangs, five such gangs being included. The names of the laborers are Amurrite, Akkadian, or Hurrian, while a number are of uncertain origin. In addi- tion, there is one name which is certainly Su- merian. PALESTINE AND SYRIA Chalcolithic Site in Jordan Valley. - NELSON GLUECK, in BASOR. 97, 1945, pp. 10-f2 (10 pls.), reports on the site of Tell Umm .Hamad esh- Sherqt, north of the confluence of the Jordan and Jabbok rivers. The surface is littered with sherds, indicating a very flourishing community, particu- larly during the Upper Chalcolithic Period (ca. 3400-3900 B.C.). An examination of the site by the joint expedition of the American School at Jeru- salem and the Smithsonian Institution shows that the civilization of this period in the Jordan Valley was widespread, and based on a well-developed system of irrigation agriculture. Most of the sherds belong to large, coarse, flat-bottomed jars with ledge handles. They are hand-made, brown- ish red in color as a rule, and often decorated with scalloping (done with a tool) or finger indentations giving an appearance of twisted ropes. The ledge handles are long and narrow, and were stuck on the sides of the vessels in nearly every case. When decorated, they seem to have been scalloped with a graving tool. The wares seem to be subsequent to Beth-shan xviim and Jericho viii, and contem- porary with Beth-shan xvii and xvI. A number of these sherds are illustrated and described. Very little comparable material has as yet been found at Jericho, but the writer believes that more ex- haustive excavations would reveal its existence. Mat impressions appear on the bases of some of the sherds. The site continued to be occupied in Early Bronze I, when we find a number of un- decorated ledge handles, some loop handles, and a number of painted sherds, the finest being a-large fragment of an excellent jug with lattice decora- tion. The evidence suggests, however, that the Early Bronze I settlement was smaller than the Chalcolithic. BAb ed-DrA, Moab. - The publication of the excavation of this site by the American School</page><page sequence="8">178 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY at Jerusalem in 19q24 has miscarried; but, in BASOR. 95, 1944, pp. 3-13 (3 pls.), W. F. AL- BRIGHT, J. L. KELSO, and J. PALLIN THORLEY examine and report on the Early Bronze Age pot- tery found in the campaign. Albright, who de- scribes and dates the pottery, points out that the delay in publication enables the writers to avail themselves of subsequent studies, and thus make a far more accurate chronology. The pottery con- sists of sherds and large fragments, outline draw- ings and photographs of which are given. It is dated from the twenty-third to the twenty-first century B.C., the bulk of it belonging to the twentv-second century. A brief but excellent description of the collection is given. Kelso and Thorley devote two pages at the end of the article to the ceramic techniques employed. The sherds belong in the class of heavy-duty red clay pottery, the clay being tempered with fragments of lime- stone, and fired at a relatively low temperature. None of it is wheel-made. Incised decoration oc- curs in only two instances. The ware was all utilitarian. and as a rule well designed for the pur- poses for which it was made. A peculiar feature is that whereas in the great majority of cases of re- pairs, only costly pottery was so repaired, at BAb ed-D)rA the cheapest vessels often show that they have 1been mended. Mt. Carmel. -In PEQ., Jan.-Apr. 1945, A. LUCAS discusses the miracle on Mt. Carmel (I Kings 18: 31-38) in the light of ii Maccabees 1:19-92. He suggests that the water was some in- flammable liquid probably resulting from some form of incomplete combustion similar to that in producing charcoal. If coniferous wood were wholly or largely used, the dry distillation would produce such inflammable substances as carbon mlonoxide gas, methane, methyl alcohol, wood tar, volatile oils, rosin spirit, and crude turpentine. A combination of these may have produced the thick water (in Mace. 1 :t1), which was ignited by the sun. Lucas sees a difficulty, however, since "there was not any strong sun, as the fire oc- curred 'at the time of the evening oblation.' " Tell Beit Mirsim. -J. L. KELSO and ALFRED R. POWELL describe a find of bitumen in the bot- tom of a pithos in a house of the Iron ii level in this site, in BASOR. 95, 1944, pp. 14-18. A sample was analyzed, and identified as glance pitch, which is found to this day in the Dead Sea, and the upper Jordan valley, this specimen being al- most certainly from the Dead Sea. It was used in antiquity for various purposes-by farmers as a cure for infected vines, for fumigating vineyards, to treat cuts and injuries to trees and vines, and as a cement for holding metal or stone tools to wooden handles. In cities, it was used as a water- proofer for brick, masonry, or wood construction, and formed an ideal base for weatherproof paints or varnishes. It also had many medicinal uses. Its natural brittleness could be overcome by softening it with olive, linseed, or castor oil. Lachish.-In BAI4OI. 97, 1945, pp. 122--25 (fig.), HERBERT GORDON MAY comments on the Lachish ostrakon, Letter Iv, saying that "we trust that it was clearer to the addressee than it is to us." He particularly treats lines 7-10, which "bristle with unsolved problems," on some of which he attempts to throw light, not unsuccess- fully, but ending with the statement that "many other conjectures might be made." - Ibid., p. 26, WV. F. ALBRIGHT adds a postscript, suggesting a tentative reading and translation of the passage. Hebrew Seal in Oxford. - In I'E., Jan.- Apr. 1945, G. R. DRIVER publishes an Israelite seal of red jasper, now preserved in the Ash- molean Museum; he dates it in the eighth or seventh century B.C., and renders the inscription: "(Belonging) to Mikneiah, son of Yehomelek." Jericho. -In PEQ., Jan.-Apr. 1945, C;. R. DRIVER thinks that the name Jericho means "founded by (the god) H.6." In the same number SAMUEL KRAUSS interprets it as "foundation of somebody who is called -cho (abbreviation of nouns like Henoch, Hanun. or Honi). Nysa-Scythopolis.-In I'E P ., Jan.-Apr., 1945, STELLA BEN-DOR publishes two new coins of Nysa-Scythopolis. On the reverse both coins have a tetrastyle temple with a standing Tyche. One coin was struck by Caracalla during the reign of his father Septimius Severus in A.D. Q06/7; the other bears the bust of Elagabalus and is dated A.D. Q18/9. Wadi Sicrhan, North Arabia.-In IA0()RH. 96, 1944, pp. 7-17 (8 figs.), NELSON GLUECK re- ports on this area, which in a former article he suggested was the connecting life-line between the two widely separated parts of the Nabataean kingdom. Explorations by the joint expedition of the American School in Jerusalem and the Smithsonian Institution have helped to emphasize its importance, even though "clear-cut Naba- taean pottery" is absent. The site of Umm-ej- Jemil was re-examined, and practically all the sites between the Iraq Oil Company pipe-line and the Syrian border were visited and studied. They</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 179 are nearly all similar to Umm-ej-Jemal, but not so well preserved, nor (with the possible exception of ITmm-el-Qetein) as large. Most of the surface ruins are of Roman or Byzantine date, with some of mediaeval Arabic times. All of them were pro- vided with reservoirs, usually Roman, and nearly every house had its own cistern. The only water supply came from the brief, but heavy, winter and spring rains. Agriculture, in the form of dry farm- ing, and the raising of live stock were the prin- cipal sources of existence in antiquity, but trade between Syria and Transjordan, and between Palestine and Arabia, was of some importance in sustaining the ancient settlements. Nabataean settlement and influence are clearly indicated in all the sites, but the finds indicate that they were most populous in the Roman and Byzantine periods. Even in Nabataean times the pottery used was always Roman, the same as has been found at Jerash. We must therefore regard this area as a colony, rather than as a part of the Nabataean state. "It is most likely, therefore, that, Nabataean pottery does not exist in any part of the Wadi Sir.ian." This area extends from Azraq in northeastern Transjordan to within ten miles of Jauf in north-central Arabia; and bends from northwest to southeast, being 910 miles long by an average of 20 miles wide. Whoever holds this area holds an important gateway from Syria into Arabia. While Moslems may enter the Arabian portion freely, others can secure visas only with difficulty. A good topographical de- scription of the area is given, as of its fauna and climatic conditions. The present population is largely Bedouin. Today, a good part of the area be- longs to Transjordan, making archaeological work possible. At 'Amri, many Roman and Byzantine sherds were seen, and one kilometer south, at a site Glueck names Khirbet 'Amri, the ruin of a large caravanserai was found, dating in late Roman times, and especially significant in the Byzantine period, to judge from the pottery found there. The expedition can prove the limits of distribution of Nabataean pottery, which ex- tendedl east to Baiyir, west to the WaTdi 'Arabah and along the Nabataean trade route to the Mediterranean coast of Palestine. It was produced and used only in the thickly settled part of the Nabataean kingdom in southern Transjordan, whose metropolis was Petra. Transjordan.-In PEQ., Jan.-Apr., 1945, G;RACE M. CROWFOOT has an article on "The Tent Beautiful-Study of Pattern Weaving in Transjordan." Some of the patterns are sketched with the Arabic names and English translation. She also lists some words used in weaving by Beni Hassan,' Transjordan, with the English equivalents. The article is followed by four pages of plates. AEGAEAN Cryptograms of Crete. - Continuing and sup- plementing her articles in this JOURNAL (xlviii, 1944, p. 64 f., and xlix, 1945, p. 143 f.), ALICE E. KOBER, in Clas8ical Outlook xxii, pp. 77-78 (6 figs.) summarizes some of her studies in the field of Minoan inscriptions. She speaks of the urgent need of deciphering the pre-Hellenic script, re- produces a number of inscriptions (most of which have already been published in this JOURNAL) and lists the definite facts that can be ascertained from them. Some of the tablets found were labels that were attached to, and were doubtless lists of, the contents of some larger object. Others were stacked on top of one another, and apparently were related to each other. The Minoan system of numeration is explained, and other known facts are given, but the ultimate decipherment is still in the future. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Kanebion-Kys. - Under this title, A. E. RAUBITSCHEK publishes, in Record Mus. Ilist. Art, Princeton iv, 1945, pp. 9-10 (fig.), a small altar in the Museum of Historic Art at Princeton, purchased by the donor in Smyrna. It is decorated with a double axe in low relief and the inscription KANHBOY, in letter forms dating about 100 B.c. The writer believes that its original provenance was the Carian city of Kys, which was formerly called Kanebion, and that it was a dedication to a Zeus Kanebos, as the double axe is a common symbol of the Carian Zeus. Economic Policy of Solon.-J. G. MILNE adds in Ilesperia xiv, 1945, pp. 230-945, notes on the economic policy of Solon, which further elucidate earlier studies on this subject. Two con- siderations may be stated as postulates. There was no organized commercial system in European Greece at the beginning of the seventh century B.C. Overseas trading was a matter of individual enterprise for which states took no responsibility. Before the middle of the seventh century, the evolution of coinage in Greek lands, including Asia Minor, had not gone further than what</page><page sequence="10">180 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Aristotle treats as the first stage, in which a metal ingot was stamped with a trade-mark by its maker as a mark of quality. It passed from hand to hand at its commodity value, which would be determined in each transaction where it was used by bargaining between the parties. Solon, according to the account current at Athens, was chosen archon for the double purpose of settling the quarrels between the rich and poor inhabitants of Attica and of framing a new code of laws. This view scarcely does justice to the wide scope of his measures which on the economic side involved wholesale reorganization of the industries of the country and city, and proved of far more lasting importance than the legislative changes which he introduced. If the reforms of Solon are regarded as a whole in their relation to the later history of Athens, it may fairly be held that his most important contribution to the welfare of his country on the economic side was the develop- ment of the silver trade. Politically the Seisach- theia stands out as a first move toward the es- tablishment of a complete democracy at Athens, but it could have contributed little to the wealth of the city. It was the silver trade that made Athens into a commercial and shipping center, and it was the discernment by Solon of the poten- tialities which lay in the use of the natural re- sources of Attica that led to the greatness of Athens in the fifth century. SCULPTURE Early Statuettes from Greece. - Under this title, CHRISTINE ALEXANDER publish'es, in BMMA. n.s. iii, 1945, pp. 38-9243 (17 figs.), a group of Aegean and Geometric statuettes, in marble, terracotta, and bronze. The earliest is a Cycladic statuette of marble, belonging in the Early Cycladic Period (ca. 3000-?200 B.c.). It is followed by a small bronze figure of the Late Minoan Period, a number of Late Mycenaean (1400-1100 B.C.) terracotta figurines of goddesses and animals, including one of a goat, originally gilded; and finally a group of bronze statuettes of the Geometric period of the eighth century B.c., and a terracotta goddess, seated on a rich throne, also Geometric. Archaic Greek Sphinx.-In JBMFA. xliii, 1945, pp. 24-26 (2 figs.), GEORGE H. CHASE pub- lishes a recent accession of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, "the most important addition to be made in many years to the collection of Greek sculpture." This is an archaic Greek sphinx from a stele, with the capital on which it was originally set. Its provenance is unknown, but it is Athenian, and of the third quarter of the sixth century B.C. The sphinx is of Island marble, while the capital is Pentelic, and in design it bears a close resem- blance to the well-known stele in New York. It has been put together from many fragments, and, barring the head of the sphinx, which is missing, is virtually intact, although some restorations have been made, which are surely correct. On the bottom of the capital is a large socket for the in- sertion of a tenon to fit the capital to its shaft, and the sphinx fits into a similar socket at the top of the capital. The capital, which is of open-work design, is unique among preserved Greek monu- ments. Many traces of the original color decora- tion remain. Chase is inclined to date this sphinx and capital a little later than the New York stele, perhaps about 530 B.c. The article ends with a well deserved tribute to the late D)r. Lacey D. Caskey, so long Curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, on whose recommendation the stele was purchased. Graeco-Roman Statuettes. - MARGAlETE BIEBER discusses in Hesperia, xiv, 1945, pp. 270-277, two Graeco-Roman statuettes in the Albright Art Gallery in Buffalo, which, while they are not artistically valuable, are interesting for Roman adaptations of Greek art and religion. A Diana, 34 inches high, said to have been found near Rome, represents the goddess seated on a rock, over which an animal skin, presumably of a boar, is spread. The Greek Artemis is the model for the costume, short chiton with belt under the breast in Hellenistic manner, himation, and endromides. The unusual feature is the fact that the goddess, in contrast to the Greek model, is seated. The Diana of Buffalo might be a copy of a cult statue from Aricia or one of the many sanc- tuaries of Diana in Italy, formed with the idea of combining the characteristics of the Greek Arte- mis, Selene, and Hestia, or the Roman Diana, Luna, and Vesta. It probably belongs to the be- ginning of the third century after Christ. The second is a statuette of a reclining Hercules, 34 inches long and 14 2 inches high, of Parian marble, lying on a lion skin with the left arm leaning on an inflated animal skin the mouth of which is used as a fountain. The Buffalo statuette is probably of the Antonine period, a period when this type first appears on coins. In his connection with fountains and warm springs, Hercules be- came a divinity of healing, and was especially venerated by the Roman army.</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 181 INSCRIPTIONS Athenian Epigrams. --F. JACOBY in Hlesperia xiv, 1945, pp. 157-911, discusses certain Athenian epigrams from the Persian wars. There is a curi- ous, almost complete, absence of Athenian epi- taphs for the fallen in those glorious battles, while we have quite a number of official, semi-official, and even private dedications. In the first half of the paper Jacoby is concerned with two epigrams on the men in the battle of Marathon. The prob- lems he discusses are the subject matter of the two poems, their text, the nature of the poems and of the monument which they adorned, the au- thorship of the epigrams. They are engraved on a block of Pentelic marble in two parallel bands, each of four lines, for a monument erected in the year of victory 490-89 B.C., and referring to one and the same event, the battle of Marathon. They belong to a publicly erected monument, either in the Agora or on the Acropolis, not as Oliver has contended, to a cenotaph in the Kerameikos. They are not epitaphs, but were rather set up to commemorate the victory and in praise of the victors, the first concerned with estimating the consequences of the valor of the Athenians for the whole of Greece, the second putting Athens in the foreground and emphasizing the fact that by this valor the town itself was saved from destruction. In opposition to Oliver, Jacoby maintains we can- not assign one epigram to Aeschylus, the other to Simonides, but rather to another, unknown writer, responsible for both. In the second part of the paper Jacoby treats the Eion poem, which has been associated with the second Marathon epi- gram. This poem contained supposedly three epi- grams on three Herms in the Agora, praising the generals who had wrenched Eion from the Per- sians. This poem is quoted by Aeschines (Ctes., 183), probably from the speech of Leptines, and by Plutarch (Kimon 7, 92) from a Hellenistic biograph- ical source which may or may not derive from the same speech. Jacoby believes the three epigrams cannot have stood on Herms in the sequence in which they are quoted by Aeschines and Plu- tarch. These epigrams became what Wade-Gery called an orator's Tr6Tos. Certainly Aeschines did not copy them from the stones, but these verses had been used earlier to point some moral, and probably in the speech against which Demosthenes directed his speech "Against Leptines" (11t), our oldest evidence for the Eion Herms and their location in the Agora. The speech is that of Lep- tines made in 356/5 B.c. to recommend his law irEpi &amp;Tr7AiaS. He was there dealing with the showering of honors upon men who had deserved well of their country. So he cited the Eion epi- grams which mentioned individual men. The first two epigrams belong together and are really second and third in the series, whereas the so- called third epigram contains a mythical para- deigma from Homer, to which he added a distich of his own making, heaping all glory on the Athenians, and clearly the Homeric paradeigma was the only "epigram" to which such a distich could be added, and it had to be quoted in the last place out of its proper order. Thus their order as quoted is to be understood from the purpose of the moralizing orator who first made use of the Eion epigrams. The authors, or rather author, is unknown to us, probably an Ionian, and perhaps a client of Kimon. As patriotic poetry the Eion poem is good, thoughwe have to understand what the poet wrote, and not what Leptines made of it while tampering with the original inscription to suit his purpose. The date is probably about 475 B.C. The poem has nothing to do with the Mara- thon epigrams. Tribute in 449/8 B.C. -H. T. WADE-GERY discusses in Hesperia xiv, 1945, pp. 919-9.9, the statement made in the Athenian Tribute Lists i 1, on the quota list which stands at the foot of the front face of the First Stele, immediately under List 5 to which the editors give the number 7, to the effect that, since no tribute was collected in 449/8, there is no List 6. Wade-Gery answers on epigraphical grounds a challenge to this point of view made by Gomme, that the evidence does not compel us to assume a year without tribute, but it does compel us to assume either a year with no tribute recorded or else a sensationally and im- probably short list for 447/6, which must have stood, in Dow's opinion, in the blank space at the head of the back space of the First Stele, just above List 9, which Dow argues was the real List 8, for 447/6. Gomme's attack on the question of tribute is essentially historical. Against his arguments may be set two passages: Thucydides i, 96, 1 and Plutarch, Pericles, 17. From Thucy- dides we infer that tribute was not legally due in 449/8 and from Plutarch that Pericles sought but failed to find in 449 a new sanction for its collec- tion. On the basis of Thucydides we may infer that the tribute hitherto collected for war against Persia had not yet been formally challenged. The Peace made with Persia in 450/49 posed a new</page><page sequence="12">1802 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY problem. From Plutarch we learn that in the Congress 1)ecree of Pericles (between 450 and 447) the business of the proposed congress is financial, as money had to be found for the Parthenon, for the festival funds, for the Athenian fleet. Tribute, if collected, would easily maintain the fleet, and the fleet would keep the seas safe. The allies had consented to pay for the Fleet's war function of fighting Persia: they are now obliquely invited to pay for its peace function. Support for this is to be found in the Reserve D)ecree (450/49) wherein Pericles claims that if by lher energy and skill Athens keeps Greece effectively safe from Persia at a cost less than estimated, she is entitled to the balance. That would settle the problem of the Parthenon, while the matter of the festival money, of less impor- tance, was perhaps left undecided. While Athens claimed full discretion in using the Reserve and the fleet may have been maintained out of this in 449/8, an item such as this coul:l not be main- tained out. of capital. Wade-Gery argues that trib)ute was reimposed in 449/8 to be paid in 448/7 and thenceforward, as the Athenian fleet was expensive and performed an international service; if demobilized, pirates would reappear, and the Persians would become dangerous again. A.T.L., List 8, as Wade-Gery conceives it as now num- bered in A.T.L.. records the payments for 447/6 of those cities who had paid in 448/7, the payment in 447/6 of certain cities who had not paid in 448/7, partial payments complementary to par- tial payments in 448/7, total defaulters paying their arrears for that year. A. T.L., List 8, reveals a remarkable recovery of arrears, due to stringent provisions of the Decree of Kleinias. A.T.L., List 7, was before that decree, and A.T.L., List 8, was after it. ROME GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Dating Etruscan Sculpture. -In The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery vii-viii, 1944-45, pp. 105-124, EMELINE HILL discusses the criteria for dating Etruscan sculpture, in this instance a series of votive bronze warriors, examples of which are in the Walters collection, and an Athena Promachos, which closely resembles the warrior type. ". . . the Etruscans were con- stantly aware of changes in fashion in Greek sculpture, and reacted to them promptly, and ?. consequently any group of Etruscan bronzes can be dated quite accurately, with reference to Greek chronology, from internal evidence." Ration Tokens in Rome. -In Classical Out- look xxii, p. 81, EMORY E. COCHRAN points out that the Romans used ration tokens, similar to the "points" used during the late War, for the procuring of foods, principally grain, but some- times also for oil or other commodities. These tesserae were of lead or wood, and some of the former are still in existence. They differed from ours in that either no cash, or very little, was re- quired with them. They are mentioned in litera- ture by Suetonius and Juvenal. Sparsiones. -In CJ. xl, pp. 515-543, HUGH NIBLEY discusses the Roman practice of bestow- ing public donatives, by throwing things among the multitude to be scrambled for. The subject is divided into three heads; (1) what was dis- tributed; (2) by whom and on what occasions; (3) by what methods. The conclusions are sum.- marized in the last paragraphs of the article. The objects, which were either tokens, such as tes- serae, coins and the like, or articles of food, solid or liquid, were symbolic of life, health, strength and abundance, and if they were tesserae, could be used as tickets for banquets or in exchange for food. The givers of sparsiones were patricians- the king, or his counterpart in Republican times, or the Emperor in the Imperial period, and the gifts symbolized the New Year. Thus a birth, a coming of age, a marriage, or even a burial, was considered a new phase in the life of the donor, who in his turn was considered the living represen- tative of the father and founder of the race. Thus, it is not astonishing to find Janus associated with sparsiones. The donations were made either from the rostra, or from a chariot, or from some other high place, being scattered like seed: "in a man- ner to simulate the sowing of the race itself on the day of creation." Parallelisms with similar customs among the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Isra- elites, and the Greeks are frequently demon- strated. SCULPTURE Martial in a Roman Museum.--KARL LEH- MANN in Hesperia xiv, 1945, pp. 259-969, analyzes a series of distichs in Martial's last book of epi- grams, dealing with works of art, which for the history of art in general he believes is of the great- est interest. He demonstrates that Martial ac- tually refers to a definite collection of works of art, that this collection was displayed in a prom-</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 183 inent place, the pronaos of the temple of the Divus Augustus, and included certain famous master- pieces. These works included a golden statue or statuette of Victory, a clay statue of a boy, the ppoJ'rTou T-ratiov, perhaps represented in a lean- ing posture like the well known "Narcissus" type of the fourth century, a figure of the Sauroctonos in Corinthian bronze (typologically identical with the Sauroctonos of Praxiteles), Hyacinthus, a panel painting either on wood or marble, a marble Hermaphroditus, Danad, a painting like the Hyacinthus, a work of Nikias, a mask of a German, a group of Hercules strangling the serpents, in Corinthian bronze, a Hercules in clay (a famous original like the boy of Brutus), Minerva in silver, Europa, a painting, a marble Leander, a terracotta hunchback. This is the only description we possess of a Roman temple mu- seum of the early empire. Representation of the Barbarian. -In The, Journal of the Walters Art Gallery vII-vIII, 1944-- 45, pp. 75-81, D)OOTHY KENT HILL publishes two b)ronze statuettes and a gem from the Wal- ters collections. Each of the bronzes represents a youth wearing a )barbarian costume as conceived in classical views, a shirt and trousers. Similar figures appearing on the gem can be identified as Mithras and accompanying genii. One of thie statuettes probably represents a captive bowing in surrender; the other, of which there is a twin in London, may be an orientalizedl Castor or Pollux. EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE Urns with Christian Symbols. - The Newi, York Herald-Tribune for October 4, 1945, reports from Jerusalem that archaeologists of the Hebrew lTniversity have announced the discovery, in a burial cave on the Jerusalem-Bethlehem road, of a series of urns with Christian symbols. One of these urns bears the inscription "Master Jesus," and the belief is expressed that it refers to Christ, and may have been carved on the urn by a group of His followers soon after the Crucifixion. Ten other urns were also found, some of which bear inscriptions in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic, none of them apparently dating later than 70 A.D., while one urn shows "the earliest known use of the Christian Cross." The archaeologists, headed Iby E. L. SUKENIK, are making an inten- sive stu(ly of this material, in the hope that it may give first-lhand testimiony fcr tie trial an:l death of Christ, and the beginnings of the Christian reli- gion. Further developments are eagerly awaited. Ephesus, Pagan and Christian. - The perti- nent facts in the history of Ephesus for the stu- dent of early Christianity are presented in an excellent survey by M. M. PARVIs and F. V. FILSON in the Bib. Archaeologist viii, 3, 1945. The history of the city is traced from the Anatolian settlement with its temple to Artemis ("Diana of the Ephesians") at the foot of the Hill of Ayas- soluk. Greek settlers arrived about 1044 B.c. and a town was built about a mile to the southwest on the slopes of Mt. Koressos. With the Lydian conquest about 560 B.c. the Greek element was al- most submerged in the Asiatic. Athena was sup- planted by Artemis, to whom a magnificent tem- ple was now erected. This temple with its one hundred great columns, six feet in diameter at the base and sculptured to a height of twenty feet or more, set up on a great platform reached by a flight of ten steps, was the most splendid monu- ment of Anatolian paganism and was accounted one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Destroyed about 356 B.C., it was rebuilt on the same magnificent scale. Alexander's conquest strengthened the Greek element in the city but Artemis retained her supremacy. The incorpora- tion of the city in the Roman province of Asia in 133 B.C. was followed by the erection of many notable buildings, such as the Great Theater which accommodated nearly 25,000 persons, and the beautiful marble paved Arkadiane connecting the Theater with the harbor. This street was bordered by colonnades, behind which were shops, in one of which a part of the apocryphal corre- spondence between Christ and Abgar of Edessa was found inscribed. In the time of Paul Ephesus was the chief port on the Aegean for the land route which led east into central Asia Minor and the regions beyond, and had a population close to a quarter of a million. Paul's ministry in this city was an attack on the very headquarters of Anato- lian paganism. Excavation has uncovered the Church of St. Mary where the Council of 431 as well as the "Robber Council" of 449 was held. It has also disclosed the Church of St. John Theologus, where the Tomb of St. John was re- puted to be. The so-called Tomb of St. Luke has been shown to be a Greek polyandrion, the Prison of St. Paul to be a structure of much later date. On the northeast slope of Mt. Pion lies the cave of the Seven Sleepers. Lapis Lazuli Carving.-In The Journal of the Waltsrs Art Gillery vii-viii, 1944-45, pp. 83-103, DOROTHY MINER and EMMA J. EDELSTEIN pub-</page><page sequence="14">184 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY lish a lapis lazuli carving of an eagle, recently acquired by the Walters. The piece, which is of exceptionally beautiful workmanship, is only about three inches in height. A comparison with sculptured eagles of different periods leads to the conclusion that the lapis lazuli carving is a work of the late Imperial or early Byzantine period- the fourth or fifth century. It most probably served as the finial ornament of an " eagle sceptre, " a type commonly carried by the emperor and by consuls. Keltic Metal Work and Manuscript Illumi- nation. - Under this title, DOUGLAS RENNIE HUDSON continues his studies in Metallurgia xxxii, 1945, pp. 9-13 (5 figs.). As in the previous installment (summarized in AJA. xlix, 1945, p. 596), this article is preceded by an abstract of its contents, and the conclusions reached. He begins with the Book of Durrow, in Trinity College, Dublin, which shows in its decoration striking analogies with metal work. Then follows a section developing the close correlation of red-dot decora- tion in manuscripts with cloisonni enamelling. The Ardagh Chalice is then described. It is dated probably before 900 A.D., and is of Keltic work. Next to be discussed is the Shrine of St. Dimma's Gospels, of silvered bronze, enriched with quartz gems, now in Trinity College, Dublin. Parts of it are as late as the thirteenth century, but the main decoration is much earlier. "Doubtless it was an early cumhdach reworked into a shrine." The metal covers of the Lindau Evangelary are then described and discussed at some length. They are worked in both champleve and cloisonne enamels, and are dated in the ninth century, while the manuscript contained in these covers is later, of the tenth century. It is now in the Morgan Library. In this connection a chalice in Krems- muenster Abbey is described and published, parts of its decoration being almost identical with the book covers. This chalice can be dated before 788 A.D., as it bears the name of a certain Tassilo, who was deposed in that year. Of the covers, one is earlier than the other, being Keltic of the ninth (or possibly eighth) century, restored and repaired about 1600. The other is surely ninth century, and seems to be contemporaneous with the ci- borium in the Reichskapelle at Munich, dated between 896 and 899, and, if anything, earlier. As a result of the studies made in these two ar- ticles, the following conclusions are reached. Scotic metal-working tradition exercised a pro- found influence throughout the western world for nearly a millennium, while Keltic influence on penmanship and lettering can be traced right down to the invention of printing. "From metal working we may quite reasonably derive the Motiv for manuscript illumination." The sugges- tion is also made that the patterns on Keltic crosses in stone are also derived from metal prototypes, perhaps in later instances through designs in manuscripts. MEDIAEVAL Viking Drinking Horn.-In Mededeelingen d. K. Nederlandsche Akad. van Wetenschappen 1940 (23 pp., 5 figs., 5 pls.), A. RoEs publishes a drinking horn, now used as a reliquary, in the Church of Our Lady at Maastricht. This horn had been repaired in 1939 by J. E. Brom, a silver- smith at Utrecht, who had recognized it as Norse, and had sent photographs to the Museum at Oslo. The authorities there requested permission to publish it, and an article on it, by B. Hougen, appeared in Viking iii, 1939, p. 115 f., in Nor- wegian, with an English translation. The writer, however, believes that further comments are necessary, and that, being in the Netherlands, it should also be published there. The horn is large, being 33.5 cm. long, with a diameter at the mouth of 9.5 cm. Metal mounts were attached to the horn by nails plated with silver. It is in an excel- lent state of preservation, but some of the mount- ings show corrosion. Its previous history is com- pletely unknown. It was first published in 1872 as a reliquary, and was believed to have come from Palestine, owing to the relics it contained. At that time documents showed that it was in the pos- session of the church as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century. The question of interest lies in its date. This can only be ascertained by a study of the mountings, "for as a work of art it stands more or less alone." By studying the tech- nique of the design of the fantastic animals with which the mountings are decorated, we can limit the dates to between 800 and 1000 A.D., and further limit it to the Early Jellinge period. The mountings were of lead, covered with thin silver foil, silver being very scarce with the Vikings. This foil was not cemented to the lead, but united by the application of heat to form one plate. These mountings were apparently not specially made for the horn, but were decorative material produced by other craftsmen, and bought by the maker. Some of the triangular mounts used in the center of the horn appear to be later replacements</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 185 for similar ornaments that had worn out, because they were where the drinker would naturally hold the horn. A comparison of this horn with the large one found in the Taplow grave in England shows a number of resemblances, as to some found in the noteworthy discoveries at Sutton Hoo. For this reason, Hougen, in his article in Viking, re- ferred to above, believes that it was made in England, but with his conclusion Roes disagrees, thinking a Danish origin "perhaps more likely." The article ends with a statement as to the use of drinking horns in later times, and gives a drawing of an English horn of the sixteenth century. St. Jerome.-In The Art Bulletin xxvii, 1945, pp. 188-194, GRETE RING discusses the origin and development of the pictorial represen- tation of St. Jerome extracting the thorn from a lion's paw, especially that type in which the saint is depicted wearing his cardinal's robes and seated before a cave in the wilderness. The author be- lieves the theme to be of literary origin, having been inaugurated by Joannes Andreas of Bologna in the first part of the fourteenth century. The earliest pictorial representation of the scene is from the hand of Roger van der Weyden. The development of the type is traced in the work of his pupil Hans Memling, on one of the wings of the "Sforza Triptych" in Brussels, and on a later panel from a private collection in England. Source of the Two-Tower Facade.-In The Art Bulletin xxvii, 1945, pp. 85-108, HERWIN SCHAEFER discusses the ultimate source of the two-tower facade and its earliest use in Western Europe. In the ideal two-tower arrangement, the facade is an integral part of the structure. ". .. the two towers form the natural termina- tion of the nave aisles and do not extend, or extend but little, beyond them. The space under the tow- ers opens into the aisles as well as into the central portion between them. This central portion between the towers is no longer set off as an en- trance hall or narthex, but is a part of the nave itself which extends clear through and thereby finds expression in the organization of the facade. There is no longer a separate facade structure, but the motif is now integrated into the whole, and at the same time articulates the parts of the whole." In Schaefer's opinion, Hans Reinhardt failed to prove, on the basis of the evidence he employed, that two-tower facades were not used on early churches in the Upper Rhine region, notably Strasbourg. The author refutes Reinhardt's evi- dence and produces arguments in favor of the first Western European appearance of the two-tower facade in this region. Schaefer agrees with the practically universal belief that the ultimate source of the two-tower facade is Syria, but its structural integration was a European interpreta- tion "inspired by the various locally existing Roman and Germanic monuments." Head from Royal Effigy.--In BMMA. n.s. iii, 1945, pp. 914-9219 (8 figs.) WILLIAM H. FORSYTH publishes a bust in the Metropolitan Museum, presented in 1941, which a detailed study convinces him is that of the young princess Marie de France. It was originally part of a tomb effigy, for the back of the head and neck are carved to rest on a stone pillow. Originally a metal crown was attached to the head. The hair is dressed in a style popular during the reign of Charles v, in the 1370's and 1380's. Close parallels exist in two tomb figures in the abbey church of St. Denis, identified as Marie d'Espagne (d. 1379) and Jeanne de France (d. 1371), where the coif- fures are almost identical. Drawings made before 1715 show the effigy of Marie de France as it then existed at St. Denis. This effigy is the only figure with this coiffure now missing from the abbey- it was already missing in 1793, when report was made that the head had been separated from the torso and stolen. Marie's sister, Blanche de France, beside whom she was buried, is still in place, and there is a strong family resemblance in features. The head is the work of Jean de Liege, one of the best known of Franco-Flemish sculp- tors. He also did the head of Jeanne d'Evreux, Marie's mother, in 1371. A record of the time shows that he was working on the heads of Marie and Blanche in 1389, forty years after the death of Marie, while Blanche was still living. Marie never married, being only fourteen years old at her death in 1341. The rest of the article deals largely with the nature and customs of royal funerals in the mediaeval period. There was much pageantry connected with them, and the wearing of black was not obligatory, except for the chief mourners. The stone effigies were probably mod- elled from wax ones carried on the coffins during the funeral procession, the faces of which had been modelled from death masks. Spanish Romanesque Sculpture. - In The Art Bulletin xxvii, 1945, pp. 165-174, DAVID M. ROBB discusses the thirty-two carved capitals used in the Pantbon or Capilla de los Reyes of the church of San Isidoro at Le6n, particularly the eight with "combinations of animal or human</page><page sequence="16">186 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY figures" and the five historiated - the nineteen foliate capitals having already been adequately studied by Gaillard. Stylistic and technical simi- larities are found in contemporary minor art - manuscripts, ivories and silver made for Ferdi- nand I and his queen, Sancha. The author con- cludes "that the craftsmen who executed the capitals were grounded in the same figure tradi- tion as those who painted the miniatures. It seems possible, moreover, that the men who executed the capitals were actually ivory carvers." Mother-of-Pearl Carving. - MARVIN CHAUN- CEY Ross contributes a brief note to The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery vii-viii, 1944-45, pp. 125-196, on a fragment of a mother-of-pearl carv- ing, depicting "Saint George and the Dragon," which was recently acquired by the Walters. It is probably from the same workshop as the mother- of-pearl carving of the "Martyrdom of St. Barbara," published in an earlier issue of The Journal (v, 1942, pp. 119 ff.), and like it may derive from a print by the Master E.S., though none is now known that exactly corresponds. RENAISSANCE Birth of the Virgin. - The cover illustration of BMMA4. n.s. iii, 1945, no. 9 (in colors) is de- voted to a representation of the panel, attributed to Fra Carnevale, of this subject, in the Metro- politan Museum, with a Note, on the inside cover, by H(ARRY) B. W(EHLE). The companion panel, of the Presentation of the Virgin, is in Boston. Various attributions to other masters have been made, but the writer adheres to Fra Carnevale, who worked in Urbino, to the school of which place these panels seem to belong. A (late of ap- proximately 1470 is assigned. "Anna Selbdritt" by Riemenschneider.-- JusTus BIER discusses the representations of "Anna Selbdritt " in connection with the publica- tion of a fine example of the group in the Walters Art Gallery, in The Journal of the WValters Art Gallery vii-viii, 1944-45, pp. 11-37. The Walters piece which is carved in linden is the work of Tilman Riemenschneider, and, from a comparison with his other known works, is to be dated not long after 1509. Its exact provenance is not known, but it might possibly be the St. Anne which Riemenschneider is known to have carved for Our Lady's Chapel in Rothenburg during the years 1505-1506. "Adulteress" of Giorgione. -E. T1ETZE- CONRAT, in GBA. ser. vi, xxvii, 1945, pp. 189-190 (fig.), publishes this painting in the Museum of Glasgow, the authorship of which has been much disputed. She believes it to be an authentic work of Giorgione, but states that the subject has been misinterpreted. It is not Christ and the Adulteress at all, but Susannah before Daniel. The reasons for this belief are clearly and convincingly given. There is a record of a contract (now lost) between Giorgione and Alvise di Sesti, under (late of 1508 (which corresponds very well with the style of the painting) calling for four paintings of the story of Daniel. The authenticity of this document has been questioned, and, as stated above, it has disappeared; but if this interpretation of the sub- ject is correct, it may well have been genuine. Giorgione's "Three Philosophers." -In GBA. ser. vi, xxvii, 1945, pp. 193-212 (16 figs.), RACHEL WISCHNITZER-BERNSTEIN studies this famous painting in Vienna, and, after discussing the discoveries made by an X-ray examination in 193Q, and giving the history of the painting as far as known, reaches the following conclusions. This picture was begun by the artist about 1504 or 1505, was then laid aside, and was taken up again in or after 1508, and largely repainted, some of the work perhaps being done by Sebastiano del Piombo, but this is to say the least problematical. The three figures are astronomers, and are identi- fied as Regiomontanus (at the left), Ptolemy (in the center), and Aristotle (at the right). The mountain at the extreme left symbolizes the name of Regiomontanus. At some later (late in the his- tory of the picture, it seems to have been cut down to fit a smaller frame, at which time an entirely unnecessary setting sun was added by a restorer. Other interpretations of the paintings are men- tioned and rejected. Gian Girolamo Savoldo.- In The Art BIdle- tin xxvii, 1945, pp. 124-138, CREIGHTON E. GILBERT discusses Savoldo's paintings, the de- velopment of his style, and the possibility of a more exact dating for some of his late works. A series of nocturnes seem certainly to have been painted for the Duke of Milan, and the author demonstrates that the most likely period for the execution of the commission was 1533-1535. Painting by Martin van Heemskerck. -A painting from the Massarenti Collection now in the Walters Art Gallery, which was formerly labeled "The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World by Paul Bril, "proved upon cleaning to bear the signature of Martin van Heemskerck and the dates 1535 and 1536. It is described by ED-</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 187 WARD S. KING in The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery vii-viii, 1944-45, pp. 61-73. Though con- taining much that could with some imagination be identified as ancient wonders, the painting is more certainly to be interpreted as a representa- tion of the abduction of Helen by Paris, and "is very possibly Heemskerck's finest effort." Ribera in St. Louis. - WOLFGANG BORN, in GBA. ser. vi, xxvii, 1945, pp. 213-226 (10 figs.), reports the discovery, in the chapel of the Acad- emy of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis, of a previ- ously unknown painting by Ribera, depicting Christ Crowned with Thorns. This picture bears his signature and the date 1650. Although its present condition is not satisfactory, it can be repaired. This subject was painted by Ribera on a canvas signed and dated probably in 1634, in Florence, a copy or second version of which is in the Wadsworth Athenaeum at Hartford, but the example in St. Louis differs widely from his earlier representations of the subject, and its treatment is doubtless deeply influenced by the tragic do- mestic circumstances of the artist at precisely this period, when he "experienced utter humiliation." Shortly afterwards, in 1652, Ribera died. Another work painted during this period of gloom is his St. Paul as Hermit in the Prado (1649). In the Christ Crowned with Thorns in St. Louis, there ap- pears some slight influence of Titian, whose painting of the subject, now in Munich, seems to have been familiar to him; but the writer thinks that the German school, particularly Holbein the Younger, and the Master of the Lyversberg Pas- sion, may have had more effect upon him. The influence of Caravaggio, however, remains strong. Ribera's feeling of depression would appear not to have been of long duration, for in the same year, 1650, he painted his most luminous picture, the Adoration of the Shepherds in the Louvre. Pierre Lepautre's Aeneas Group. - Since the publication of her article in The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery vi, 1943, pp. 71 ff., two addi- tional bozzetti for the Aeneas group have been brought to the attention of the author, GERTRUDE ROSENTHAL. One in the Museum of Historic Art at Princeton, and the other in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London are described in the current issue of The Journal vii-viii, 1944-5, pp. 1?7-130. Esteban March. -- MARTIN S. SORIA discusses the work and style of the Spanish Baroque painter, Esteban March, and assigns some hitherto unat- tri)buted paintings to his hand in The Art Bulletin xxvii, 1945, pp. 109-193. "Buried until now under the weight of erroneous attributions, Esteban March is revealed as one of the more exciting Baroque painters in Spain . AMERICA Kinishba, Arizona. - The New York Herald- Tribune for October 1, 1945, calls attention in a short article to the excavations at this site, con- ducted by BYRON CUMMINGS, Director emeritus of the Arizona State Museum. It is in a valley in eastern Arizona, and is a city built before the coming of the white men. The excavations have been in progress for nine years. Atlatls in California.- In The Masterkey xix, 1945, pp. 109-112 (2 figs.), ROBERT F. HEIZER calls attention to the fact that spear-throwers, or atlatls, were introduced in at least three separate periods into California during the historic period. Each specimen was of a different type, and two were derived from Mexico and Alaska. It is gen- erally believed that the atlatl is a more primitive weapon than the bow, which ultimately sup- planted it; but the writer considers that this theory is "an oversimplification," and that the atlatl "may be discounted as an aboriginal implement among the late archaeological and historic California Indians." The throwing stick collected in 1792 at Santa Barbara by G. G. Hewitt of the Discovery was for a long time thought to be a true aboriginal type, but the writer believes it to be derived from Mexico and was introduced through Hispanic colonial settle- ment. The weapon must have been rare, as it is not mentioned in contemporary accounts. Two others from Alaska'have been found in the Chan- nel Islands-one, in the University of California Museum, found on San Nicolas Island, has been correctly so identified, while the other, in the American Museum of Natural History, is also of Alaskan origin. A final example is of a Basket- Maker type, discovered in a private collection in Susanville, California, which the owner claims belonged to a local Indian, who apparently was imperfectly acquainted with its use, as his son-in- law had to be taught how to use it. The conclusion is therefore reached that the use of the autochtho- nous atlatl did not survive in California, and that the evidence for its use in early times is slight. Piro Drum.-F. W. H(ODGE) publishes, in The Masterkey xix, 1945, p. 89 (cover illustration), a drum and drumstick in the Southwest Museum, which he believes "may be the only ethnological</page><page sequence="18">188 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY objects of the extinct Piro Indians of New Mexico." The drum is in perfect condition, but bears indications of considerable age. The only evidence for assigning it to this tribe is an inscrip- tion on a label attached to the drum, which was purchased in Santa Fe; but the alleged prove- nance, Las Cruces, is in the ancient Piro country. The few survivors of the Piro in Chihuahua have lost their aboriginal traits and even their language. Hopi Dart Game. -FRANCES E. WATKINS describes this game in The Masterkey xix, 1945, pp. 113-115 (2 figs.). It was played always by boys or men, and was called mo toun, or "throw- ing the wheel," as the darts were thrown at a moving target, a hoop, usually made of corn- husks. The Southwest Museum owns a set of im- plements for the game, consisting of such a hoop and five darts. These darts are made of corn cobs, with points at one end and feathers at the other. The object is to hit the hoop in motion, and the rules of the game are given. In September, during the Oogol ceremony, a similar game is played by women, but it is part of a ritual, and is never confused with the boys' game. Peruvian Art.-Under the title, "Peruvian Art, Past and Present," the late GEORGE C. VAILLANT, in a posthumous article in GBA. ser. vi, xxvii, 1945, pp. 241-252 (19 figs.), calls atten- tion to an exhibition held in the autumn and early winter of 1944-45 at the University Museum in Philadelphia, of which he was Director at the time of his death, dealing with this subject. It was divided into Pre-Columbian, Colonial, and Repub- lican sections, and was derived from the Museum's own collections, and from loans from several private collections. From the pre-Conquest art of Peru there is little in striking monumental form, but in pottery, metal work, and, above all, in textiles, Peruvian art of the Inca and Pre-Inca periods excelled. In textiles in particular, Pre- Conquest Peru "challenges the production of any country in the world," while in ceramics Peru "probably takes the lead" in the American con- tinental area. Pre-Columbian architecture was in violent contrast with the detail of other products, being overwhelmingly massive, but almost never relieved by architectural ornament. After the con- quest in 1531 manual skill "dropped rapidly away," but a powerful Spanish colonial art arose, and stone-carvers had abundant opportnnity to show their ability in ecclesiastical sclupture, while metal-workers, wood-carvers, and joiners soon found a demand for their products. Painting also developed, almost entirely in the religious field. This was practically a new art in Peru, and a distinct school came into existence at Cuzco, which became well known. When Peru became independent in 1828, there was a temporary decline in art, largely due to bad economic condi- tions, and to the poverty of the Church, so that the arts "switched away from religion," and tried to compete with importations from Europe and elsewhere. Under such men as Pancho Fierro, Hector Lazo, and Jose Sabogal, efforts have been made to create a truly national art, by merging Indian and Colonial forms and skills. Santos. -A "Santo" is a New Mexican term for primitive statues and paintings of saints and sacred personages made by early Spanish settlers, depending on native woods and home-made pig- ments. " The result was a naive but sincere form of art which has an appeal all its own." The South- west Museum installed an exhibition of these objects in April, 1945, supplemented by photo- graphic reproductions from other sources. Of the examples in the Museum, the best seems to repre- sent Christ standing under the gate of Heaven, and is sculptured in the round. Others are flat paintings, of which the best is of Our Lady of Guadelupe. Other sculptures and paintings are described. There are two small figures in plaster and one painting on metal (M. R. H(ARRINGTON) in The Masterkey xix, 1945, pp. 125-126). Ecuadorian Sculpture. -In BMMA. n.s. iii, 1945, pp. 209-213 (7 figs.), Josi GABRIEL NA- VARRO calls attention to the sixteenth-century sculpture in Quito, Ecuador, when the city was the center for the production of polychrome sculpture in Latin America. This sculpture is en- tirely religious, and started in 1535 in a little school of the Franciscan Friars at Quito. Importations from Spain and particularly from Italy appear early, and some of these are still preserved in churches and convents, while processional statues from Spain were of great service in spreading Christianity among the natives. There were different groups of sculptors-those who did or- namental work, those who specialized in relief, and those who worked in the round. These groups were formed into guilds, who established work- shops and taught apprentices. Much of the sculp- ture is in wood with rich polychrome decoration - a technique still greatly used in Quito-and shows strong Spanish influence, with some Chinese tech- niques employed in the application of colors and varnishes. Sculptured groups are rare in Quitan</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 189 statuary, and there are few portraits. In making reliefs, wood or plaster was used, and the reliefs were nearly always painted. There are sculptured wooden retables, which cover part or all of chapel walls behind the altar- sometimes, indeed, they cover the entire chapel or church. Examples are given. There is also some fine sculpture in stone in some of tile churches or convents. Pottery figurines begin to appear by the end of the eight- eenth century. The earliest known sculptors are Diego (te Robles and Luis de Rivera, of the six- teenth century, some of whose works are listed. In the seventeenth are Padre Carlos and Olmos; in the eighteenth are Bernardo de Legarda, Jacinto Lopez, Antonio Fernandez, and- Maestro ITriaco. Two sculptors of this century, Manuel Chili and Gaspar Zangurima, were Indians, and masters of consummate skill. FAR EAST Prehistory of the Chinese.--BliMFEA 15, 1943, 304 pp., is devoted in its entirety to a sum- mary of J. G. ANDERSSON'S investigations of early Chinese culture which the author announces as the last of his scientific papers. It is a condensed rec- ord( of the writer's personal 'acquaintance with data collected in the field and during many years spent in studying this great mass of material. Following a preface briefly describing the princi- pal sites explored from 1916 to 1937 and an ac- count of methods of field and laboratory work, the author proceeds to his investigation of early man in China. He divides the early cultures of China into the following epochs: for the so-called Yang Shlao or proto-Chinese hlie proposes 2200-1700 B.C. Most of his earlier datings are based on the finds at the famous site of Chou K'ou Tien on the Peking plain that has proved a veritable El D)orado for the study of early man. He proposes 25,000 B.c. for the remains of the non-Mongolian homo sapiens from the upper cave at Chou K'ou Tien. 50,000 B.C. is Andersson's (late for the Ordos finds connected with Palaeolithic man. The Hominid mandible and the large well made flint flakes from the upper part of loc. 1 at Chou K'ou Tien are dated at less than 500,000 years old. Peking man (Sinanthropus pekcinensis) from the same site is placed at 500,000 years old. More than 500,000 years old is a fine flint implement from loc. 13 at Chou K'ou Tien. Approximately 1,000,- 000 years old are the very uncertain traces of Hominids found at Ni Ho Wan and Chou K'ou Tien, loc. 12 and 14. After discussion of these and other prehistoric stone implements, Andersson takes up a detailed discussion of prehistoric pot- tery. He believes that the Lung Shan culture is sbmewhat later than Yang Shao on the basis of archaeological evidence. "What we find at Yang Shao Tsun may be only the beginning of the black pottery which, upon the abandonment of the painted pottery and the development of the Kuei tripod, bone divination, and the building of mud walls, grew up to form the mature Lung Shan culture." The following chapters (8 through 21) are de- voted to complete and detailed descriptions of all the sites at which prehistoric pottery has been found. With chapter 2 the writer undertakes a review of the prehistoric ceramic art of Kansu, beginning with Yang Shao and ending with Hsia Ching (ca. 500 B.C.). AXndersson admits that we know as little of the origin of the Yang Shao cul- ture as we do of the bronze art which, half a mil- lennium later, develops seemingly overnight at Anyang. He traces the stylistic development in the small spiral centers of the Pan Shan urns which gradually increase in size and become filled with various designs until in Ma Chang times they are transformed into concentric circles. This develop- ment from Yang Shao to Ma Chang is in many features a degeneration, as, for instance, in the case of the death pattern. Evidently, the strict customs regulating the burial ceremonies of the Middle Yang Shao period were no longer upheld in the Ma Chang era, and correspondingly, the death pattern deteriorated into rows of minute rectangles. "As a whole," Andersson observes, "we are entitled to state that in spite of certain innovations at different times, there was a re- markable continuity in the development of the ceramic art of Kansu during 2000 years from 2500 to 500 B.C. In this respect Kansu stands in marked contrast to Honan where Yang Shlao is not only the first but also the last stage of prehis- toric painted pottery. This we can explain only by assuming that in Honan one or more pre-Anyang stages, Hsia or whatever other name we may use, marks the very beginning of dynastic China, suppressing the painted pottery in favor of the new bronze art. The later stages of Kansu were contemporaneous with the early dynasties of Honan-Shensi. It is noteworthy, however, that there are few parallels between Kansu and dynas- tic China during the period 1700 to 500 B.C." Among the few links with dynastic China that the author indicates is the Li tripod with its bulbous</page><page sequence="20">190 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY legs, a shape which frequently suggests the early bronze Li. This is one of the earliest types of pot- tery vessels and is characteristically Chinese. Certain other vessels have highly stylized human and animal designs painted on their surface. Most of these types are not of Yang Shao origin but come from later Kansu sites. "Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic representations," Andersson says, "run through the whole series of cultural stages from Yang Shao to Sha Ching. The animals and human figures on the Ma Chia Yao and Pan Shan ceramics form part of their decorative system and are utterly stylized even to the extent that the human figures are completely dismembered." In his comparison of the Yang Shao culture with historical China Andersson enumerates the bronze shapes that appear to have their prototypes in prehistoric pottery forms. These are the Ting, Li, Kia, Hsien, Ku, and Kuei. Chapter 30 is devoted to the Far Eastern prov- inces of prehistoric painted pottery (Southern Manchuria, Jehol, Shansi, Shensi, Honan, Kansu, and Sinkiang). All.the vessels from these outlying districts, however, must be considered of late date. In this section Dr. Andersson favors us with a patient and convincing demolition of Bach- hofer's theories on the connections between Yang Shao and the painted pottery of the Black Earth region. Andersson himself offers strong parallels between Late Yang Shao designs and the pat- terns of the prehistoric pottery of Anau. He insists, however, that with our present limited knowledge it is premature to discuss where these cultural impulses first arose and how they migrated across Central Asia. A Parthian shot directed at Bach- hofer concludes: "It is not only unfounded but rather disgraceful when we Europeans, working under a superiority bias that lacks proportionate perspective speak of 'Herrenvilker' who brought a superior culture to China." The closest resem- blance between the West and China is found not in Yang Shao but in the late pottery of Ma Chang. Andersson's last chapter is devoted to the es- tablishment of a tentative chronology for the painted pottery culture. In the Late Stone Age Andersson gives three separate periods, each char- acterized by a distinctive painted ware: Ch'i Chia (2500-2200 B.c.); Yang Shao (2200-1700); Ma Chang (1700-1300). The last era is of course coeval with the Shang period which, upon Pro- fessor Karlgren's advice, Andersson dates in round numbers 1500-1000 B.c. The former figure Andersson takes as a dividing line "between what is, with our present knowledge, historic and pre- historic time in Honan." In the Bronze Age, again, Dr. Andersson applies the names of three local wares to successive periods: Hsin Tien (1300- 1000); Ssu Wa-Ch'ia Yao (1000-700); Sha Ching (700-500). Appended to the text on p. 299 is a spectroscopic analysis of selected bronze speci- mens. Ritual Objects of Prehistoric China.-In BMFEA. 14, 1942, pp. 65-70, BERNARD KARL- GREN discusses and classifies types of neolithic objects from the site of Yang-shao tsun in Honan province. Karlgren's first group includes two earthenware specimens that are parallel to phallic emblems found at Mohenjo-Daro and the chal- colithic sites in Northern Beluchistan. Included in this group also are specimens of a phallic character from Yin. These are described as "bot- tle-shaped horns" which were probably used as the horns on large marble sculptures representing dragons or t'ao-t'ieh. Such a ritual phallus used as the butting-horn of a magic animal is a typical fecundity symbol. Karlgren's second group of objects comprises specimens of a "bobbin" shape that bear an unex- plained resemblance to the horns or uprights on the ritual bronzes of the Tsiie and Kia types. The third group consists of small earthenware cones which again bear a resemblance to the up- rights of some of the Tstie and Kia bronzes. Karlgren calls attention to the resemblance be- tween the phallic pictogram for ancestor (tsu) and the earthenware and bronze forms under dis- cussion. The author, after pointing out that the phallic nature of the first and third groups is obvious, ad- mits that the character of the bobbin group is less clear. However, since the latter have been found at the same site with other phallic objects and seem to be interchangeable with the phallic cones on the Yin bronzes, it appears likely that the bobbins, too, have a fertility significance. Prob- ably, the writer concludes, all three types have a religious significance, the larger ones being used as cult objects and the small bobbins and cones serving as amulets. Weapons and Tools of the Yin Dynasty. -In BMFEA. 17, 1945, pp. 101-144, BERNARD KARL- GREN gives a survey of the weapons characteristic of the Yin dynasty found at Anyang. He gives a list of 187 specimens distributed in fifteen classes, including all types of spears, axes, daggers, etc. This enumeration and its studies are based in</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 191 large part on specimens belonging to the MFEA. Karlgren devotes most of his contribution to a detailed examination of the connections between early Chinese art and the art of the Steppes and, in relation to this problem, the history and date of Anyang. He concludes that there is no his- torical source, either Chinese or Western, to sup- port the theory of the existence of a high culture in Siberia that could have influenced the art of the Yin dynasty. It appears likely that animal-head knives and. daggers of Yin origin first influenced the culture of the Steppes around 1000 B.C. Pre- sumably these same types did not reach Scythia until around 500 B.C. In connection with these dates Karlgren argues that the traditional date of the Chou dynasty, as handed down from Han times, is erroneous, and that 1097 B.C., the date given by the Chu shu, is more acceptable. He then proposes that the true dates of the Shang d(ynasty should be 1523-1098 B.C. and that the Yin-Chou style lasted until 900 B.C. Date of the Early Dong-So'n Culture.- BERNARD KARLGREN in BMFEA. 14, 1942, pp. 1-28, sets out to prove that the early drums of the Dong-So'n culture must be considered as belong- ing to the Huai style of the pre-Han era. In some of the scenes represented on the drums he believes we may recognize representations of magical rites in which bird-men and cervid-men participate. He finds close parallels for this motif on Huai bronzes and is tempted to find evidences of a cul- ture common to the three contiguous provinces of Ordos, Huai, and the Dong-So'n area as revealed in their common art motifs and religious ideas. The author goes on to state, however, that the Ordos connection cannot yet be satisfactorily proved. The second part of the paper deals with Heine- Geldern's theory of Western influences on the Huai-Dong-So'n culture. Karlgren concludes that the supposed Hallstattian-Caucasian-Transylva- nian influences on both the Huai and early Dong- So'n cultures are based on statements and assumptions that are completely erroneous and untenable. Karlgren suggests the date of fourth and third centuries B.C. for the Dong-So'n bronzes. Carter Collection. - The Museum of Historic Art of Princeton University reports the gift of a collection of about seventy Chinese bronze weapons, mirrors, and harness parts, from Mrs. Thomas F. Carter, who bought them in Peking. The weapons are of the Shang and Chou Dynas- ties and "will be valuable for a much needed monograph in this field," while the mirrors date from the Chou to the T'ang Dynasty (Record Mus. Hist. Art, Princeton iv, 1945, p. 11). Chinese Bronze Buddhist Group.-In BMFA. xliii, 1945, pp. 13-19 (5 figs.), KOJIRO TOMITA re-examines the famous dedicatory group of the Buddha Amitdbha and attendants acquired by gift in 1929 by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It has been evident for some time that a number of attendant figures were missing at the time of its acquisition by the Museum, and it was believed that these missing figures were in the col- lection of the late Charles Rutherston of Brad- ford, England. This belief has now been proven a certainty, through the loan to the Museum of these figures by Mrs. Rutherston and Mrs. Christopher Powell. The tangs of four of the five figures in question fit in corresponding sockets on the altarpiece, while the fifth was secured by matching the remnants of an iron dowel. The two Bodhisattvas which accompanied the altar- piece, and which came to the Museum with the original gift, have also been placed in their proper locations on the forward part of the platform. There are still two small pieces missing, pre- sumably pendants. A description of the r6le of the Buddha Amitabha is given, together with the significance of his pose and gestures, and the splendor of his paradise. With the altarpiece is a censer, which is described but not illustrated. The altarpiece, according to an inscription, was dedi- cated by eight mothers, and dates in 593 A.D. U.S.S.R. The following summaries have been taken from Materiali i Issledovaniia po Arkheologii SSSR, No. 2, Moscow, 1941, published by the Academy of Sciences of U.S.S.R. Don Region.- The Palaeolithic station of Bor- shevo II, which is situated on the right bank of the Don River not far from Voronezh, was excavated by P. Efimenko and later by P. Boriskovskii. Three levels were excavated, the uppermost in- dicating a transition period between the Magdale- nian and the Azilian. For example, Elephas primi- genius had already disappeared. The lowest level yielded a large quantity of worked flints, mainly microlithic tools and flakes less than 5 cm. in length. Predominant were lateral burins. In addi- tion, there were other types of burins, end scrapers and backed blades, many indicating considerable use. Among bone tools were bone awls of Lepus sp. and two well-made reindeer antler picks or chisels</page><page sequence="22">1992 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY bearing lozenge ornamentation. Boriskovskii sug- gests that these latter may have been used either as picks for breaking ice as the Eskimo do or to dig up food plants. The fauna of this lower level contained: Elephas primigenius, Equus caballus, Lepus sp., Rangifer tarandus, Gulo borealis, Canis lupus, an(t Vulpes vulpes. The lowest archaeological depositextended along the bank of the Don for about 115 m. with a breadth of 10-13 m. The cultural remains (flints, bones, and charcoal) were distributed throughout this section with the exception of three special areas of concentration. The most important of these was an area covering about 160 square meters, which was probably the main dwelling site. Here were unearthed 40 scrapers and 46 burins and the bones of several species of animals. The other two were sites for flint-knapping and hone-working respectively. Near the latter were found some 500 flints, including 54 burins, 5 scrapers, d(ecorated implements of reindeer antlers and a number of split mammoth bones. The lower archaeological deposit at Borshevo II is attributed to the middle of the Magdalenian Period; chron- ologically, it most resembles the stations at Timonovka and Goncy. Urals.- The exploitation of a quarry situated not far from Ust-Katav railroad station led to the discovery in 1936 of a cave, whose galleries to- talled at least 175 m. In the first chamber S. Bibikov found a large quantity of Quaternary animal bones embed(ded in a yellowish deposit resting on a reddish clay. The fauna included: Ele- phas primigenius, 1Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Equnus sp., Bison priscus, Cervus elaphus, Alces alces, Rang'fer tarandus, Capreolus pygargus, Ursus spelaeus, Ursus arctos, Ursus sp., Meles meles, Canis lupus, Canis sp., I'ulpes vulpes, Vulpes lagopus, Lepus sp., Microtus aeconomus, Arvicola terrestris, Marmota bobac. V. Gromov, who identi- fied these fauna, assigns them to the Rissian. The conditions of the site of the bones and the charac- ter of their fractures established that the cave of Ust-Katav was used by animals, probably wolves, who brought their prey to this lair. The explora- tion of the right bank of the Katav River near Ust-Katav yielded little but several flints prob- ably belonging to the late Palaeolithic. During 1938-1939 near Ust-Katav several Palaeolithic caves, including those at Kliuchevaia and Bura- novskaia, have been found. Their fauna is a little more recent than that at Ust-Katav. Sea of Azov.-Near Melitopol during 1936 L. Bader explored a rocky outcrop called "Kamen- naia Mogila," located on the alluvial plaini of the Molochnaia River. In 1890 N. Veselovskii had reported, but not published, rock engravings here. Bader located them in thirteen localities, includ- ing a remarkable cave on whose ceiling were engraved a series of bulls and a mammoth. Among these of special interest were four bulls, two following each other. The other engravings, highly stylized in character, are mainly composed of linear geometric figures similar to those of Joignes (Aisne) and Seine-et-Marne, Venta de la Perra in Spain and the cave of Romanelli in Italy. The closest representations to these from the shores of the Sea of Azov occur in North Africa, for example in the rock shelters of Foum Bir Seid and Kifien. Within the Soviet Union similar engravings have been found in the Magdalenian deposits at Mgvimevi in the Caucasus and the ornamentation on stone churingas from micro- lithic stations in the Crimea. Bader considers the bulls to be the oldest at Kamennaia Mogila and attributes the more schematic designs to the period from the Epipalaeolithic to the Neo- lithic. Siberia.-A. P. Okladnikov writes that nat- uralistic stone fish from cemeteries and Neolithic dwellings have generally been interpreted as pendants, representations of spirits, or of religious significance. However, ethnographic parallels es- tablish very close analogies with contemporary fishing equipment, such as net sinkers or lures. They are used without hooks with the fishing harpoon. This procedure is known among the Yakuts, Evenks (Tungus), Kereks, Aleuts, Orot- chis, Nentsis, (Samoyeds), ancient Eskimo and Algonquian Indians. This special kind of fishing is common among the most ancient cultures of North America and northern Asia. Religious Chants and Russian Icons. - Under this title, NATHALIE SCHEFFER, in GBA. ser. vi, xxvii, 1945, pp. 1~9-142 (12 figs.), describes the different parts of the Russian liturgy, and il- lustrates with icons the representation of certain of these moments. Thus, a fifteenth-century icon in Kiev reproduces "The Great Entrance," but the scene is in Heaven. The Litany of the Pre- sanctified is portrayed in a seventeenth-century icon in the Old Believer's Cemetery at Moscow. while a sixteenth-century icon in the same place shows another phase of the same liturgy. "Litur- gical chants resound in the symbolic subjects of many icons." Thus, St. John of Damascus and St.</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 193 Cosmas of Maiuma are represented on an icon, also in Moscow, illustrating the hymn, What Shall We Offer Thee?, which deals with the visit of the Magi. Another icon, once in Leningrad, illustrates a hymn, The Only Begotten Son, ascribed to the Emperor Justinian. The interpretation of this hymn gave rise to many arguments among the clergy. Other icons represent hymns dealing with the Descent into Hell and the Resurrection, while the Good Thief, symbol to the Russians of Hope, always appears in these icons, either alone, or as an integral part of larger compositions. In the seventeenth century, Western influence appears, and adds new features to the composition of icons. "The icon painter worked hand in hand with the hymnologist."
