It has become fashionable to construct both specific and generalizing statements about style and meaning in African sculpture around the exhibition of a single private, sometimes public, collection. Although such attempts have produced variable results, suc- cessful achievements may be found in cata- logues and books by Fagg (1968, 1971), Sieber and Rubin (1968), Laude (1973), and Thompson (1971, 1974). The present work by Comet falls within this category of writings dealing with the sculptures from many ethnic groups that con- stitute a single private collection. Earlier con- tributions by Cornet largely belong to the same type. Arts de l'Afrique noire au pays du fleuve Zaire (Brussels: Arcade, 1972), even though much more elaborate in its explana- tions, is mainly geared in its illustrative mate- rial to one private collection; Art from Zaire: 100 Masterworks (1975) concentrates on sculp- tures owned by the Institut des Musees Na- tionaux du Zaire. This lavishly produced work is nothing more (or less) than a rather elementary cata- logue, and its title, A Survey of Zairian Art, is completely out of proportion. Albeit the Bronson collection is eminently rich and in- teresting (I have not seen the exhibition to make a personal judgment about the quality of the pieces), still no privately owned group of artworks is capable of sustaining even a shadow of a global survey. It is quite normal that many "tribal arts" and types and categories of objects are underrepresented or lacking in a private collection. And this un- evenness is, of necessity, reflected in the book. Similar lacunae can at least partly be offset by detailed introductory exposes in which the arts illustrated are placed in their wider cultural, historical, and stylistic perspectives and frameworks, but no such effort is made in the present work. The book is pleasing as a visual document that more than adequately illustrates sculptures from an important collection, and the translation by Matt McGaughey reads very well. As a scholarly document, however, the work is disappointing. The author himself qualifies his text as a "commentary" (p. 16) but hopes that it "will go beyond a simple description of the pieces and help to enrich the overall picture of the traditional Zaire art- istic complex." I find the comments as a set of catalogue entries in general reasonably clear and instructive. But, apart from some specific details, I doubt that these notes add much to a deeper understanding of the arts of Zaire. Granted that the sketchy bibliography (p. 373) is compensated somewhat by the elaborate entries in Comet's earlier work, the fact re- mains that it includes only one title that was not already available before 1971. The author points out that "the quality of research" (p. 15) has increased considerably and claims to use "such new information" (p. 16); but cer- tainly, except for references to his own work and that of his institute, the introductions and captions to the plates do not indicate this. The quality and scope of a large amount of re- cently published research necessitate even more that it be adequately used. The author's stated aim is to place "major emphasis on stylistic appreciation of the works of art and their cultural background" (p. 16)-this is somewhat different from the foreword statement by Moussa Domit that "the emphasis here is placed on artistic rather than ethnographic considerations" (p. 9). The captions to the plates obviously show as much concern with cultural background (tribal iden- tification, name, general usage, and func- tion) as with stylistic and aesthetic qualities of the artworks. At any rate, it is a fallacy to think that writings that rely on classifications, na- WX :: V:: U,: 6 1::,j .jj fu u, 0 0 LO -6 0 0 tm ca ca m iataMnina aifona 00 81</page><page sequence="2">tive nomenclatures, functional interpreta- tions, and use such concepts as "tribe," "tri- bal style," "style groups," and "substyles," can dispense with precise cultural and histori- cal information. The short introduction (pp. 17-23) consists mainly of a concatenation of simplistic state- ments: "art styles generally vary from tribe to tribe"; "the styles also ... vary with different types of art objects"; "in some cases [there are] different styles . . . within the same tribe," and so forth (see particularly p. 18). The author points to the lack of "comprehen- sive tribal maps of Zaire" (p. 18). Citing Olga Boone's earlier ethnic map (1955), he omits reference to her later pioneering inventories and maps (1961, 1973). At any rate, when we think a moment about the extremely intricate situations existing nearly everywhere in Zaire, will it ever be possible to reduce to maps the precise territorial distribution of "tribal" groups? In briefly evaluating existing stylistic clas- sifications for Zaire, the author leaves aside many valuable efforts and refinements pre- ceding and following Olbrechts's Plastiek van Kongo (1946). He believes that a map of 1902 (p. 24) is "the first effort of this type" (p. 18), which it is not! The materials of the catalogue are organized into "eight style groups" (p. 20), elsewhere called "regions," which are named after rivers, except for the "East Cen- tral Region." Each region is briefly introduced and illustrated with a variable number of artworks arranged "tribally." This classifica- tion is considered to be "primarily pedagogi- cal" and "only temporary" (p. 20). The main changes from the groupings presented in Art de l'Afrique noire au pays du fleuve Zaire (1972) are the following: there are now nine regions instead of eight; they are no longer placed into four groups; the Uele and the Ubangi regions are unchanged; the Lower River Region in- cludes only Kongo-derived groups treated as separate "tribal" units (Yombe, Woyo, Vili, Bembe, Mboma, and Kongo Baboma); the Teke are removed from the Lower River Re- gion and placed with the Yaka and the Holo in the Kwango Region; the new Kwilu-Kasai Region comprises the former Tshokwe Region and some groups formerly listed under the Kwango-Kwilu and Kuba regions, with the Kasai-Sankuru Region somewhat reduced because of this; the former Luba and Songye regions are merged, and the new Upper River Region is more nuanced into Songye, Luba, Hemba, and north and northeast styles; the East Central Region overlaps with the former Lega Region. Reasons and criteria for these modifications are not explained but appa- rently are to be provided in a forthcoming publication (p. 19). As far as the captions to the plates are con- cerned, it is impossible to enumerate the stronger and weaker points made in them. Some details presented are new and signifi- cant; others are vague, elliptical, and some- times gratuitous. For example, about a Lega mask the remark is made that "the style and patination of the mask point to a number of generations of usage" (p. 332). Regarding the northern groups of the East Central Region the author says, "The tribes of this area are not yet well known" (p. 331); these northern tribes include the Nyanga, on whose culture I have contributed many studies, including four books. The statement about a yanda figurine of the Zande that such statuettes are usually female (p. 313) deserves explanation. In his analysis of 250 yanda, Burssens (1961, pp. 135-37) has noted that most (72%) of the anthropomorphic figurines have no genitalia, that few are explicitly male and 17% are female, but that many of the "asexual" figurines have female attributes (e.g., hairdo); and that regardless of all this, the members of the Mani association regard them as female. The "triangular-faced figures attributed to the Bembe ... should be classified, at least in part, as the work of the Sikasingo tribe, a sub-tribe of the Buyu" (p. 314). The Sikasingo (read either Basikasingo or Kasingo instead) are neither a tribe nor a subtribe; if they are a tribe, then they are not a subtribe. Rather, they constitute a complex transitional group between Bembe and Buyu, and include ele- ments of several ethnic components (see Biebuyck, African Arts V, 3 [1972], pp. 12-19, 75-84). Many other observations of this kind would demand explanation and reassess- ment, and their occurrence seems to point to a certain lack of systematics and scrutiny, and to haste as well. This sumptuous book, which brings to our attention an important collection of artworks exIi,ll lll[!lll lIl, gi ll iiT-ll~l ......l Ill  II  [=~I~II ,-_II-, You Icoldhe;lp. from Zaire, exhibits a certain lack of content. We have had too much of this kind of treatise that stirs but does not satisfy our quest for understanding of the African arts. Daniel P. Biebuyck University of Delaware</page></plain_text>
