At best is was possible to sketch the rudi- mentary outlines of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic habitation of Old Europe, but to detail the deepest beliefs, rituals and art of these prehistoric Euro- peans was to ask almost the impossible. Yet this cradle of civilization did not arise out of thin air. We now have evidence of a remarkable tradition of temple building beginning as early as the seventh millennium b.c. and continuing through to the rise of Minoan civilization on Crete. The actual remains of temples from the seventh, sixth and fifth millennia b.c. have been excavated, but perhaps more illuminating are the fascinating clay temple models found in these prehistoric tem- ples and shrines. Other cult paraphernalia such as vases and votive figurines further illustrate this tradition of highly symbolic and distinctively Euro- pean religious art. Although they stem from vari- ous cultures and periods, principally in Romania and Bulgaria, these temples, temple models and cult paraphernalia are marked by recurring sym- bols, designs and inscriptions - a cultural short- hand that attests to pervasive and enduring crea- November/December 1980 41</page><page sequence="2">Reconstructed clay temple model fromPorodin, with wide inverted T-shaped entrances on all sides and goddess mask on a cylinder in the roof.

Archaeologists just beginning to decipher the temple world of Old Europe, are finding clear lines of architectural and religious influences that stretch through to the far later Minoan-Mycenaean period and beyond to Greek and even Roman times. The 50 or so clay temple models discovered so far are tremendously important because they allow us to see the workings of Old Europe's shrines in strik- ing detail. Usually found in front of or near the site of a former altar, these shrines in miniature were probably gifts to the prehistoric goddess of the tem- ple. Generally small enough to be held in a person's hand, the models are doubly revealing: they not only reproduce the temple's configuration, but they are also often elaborately decorated with symbolic designs and inscribed with religious symbols. Fre- quently a divine image in relief adorns the gables, roof tops or roof corners. Among the earliest models discovered are sev- eral from the Neolithic Sesklo culture of Thessaly in Greece. Dating to about 6000 b.c., they portray rectangular buildings with pitched roofs, painted checkerboards or striated rectangles on their walls, and decorated gables. Noteworthy openings in their roofs and sometimes in their sides make them look, perhaps not coincidentally, like tiny birdhouses. A group of slightly later clay models was found in a mound of the Porodin settlement near Bitolj in Macedonia in present-day southwest Yugoslavia. The product of the so-called Starčevo culture of the central Balkans, dating to about 5800-5600 b.c., these models are capped with unusual features. Cylindrical chimneys in the center of their roofs bear the mask of a goddess with the beginnings of a necklace that spreads down over the roof. The tem- ple building below seems to have been constructed as the literal "body" or "heart" of the deity; the structure, with the cylinder head on top, seems to be essentially a deified portrait bust. Perhaps for a mythologically related reason, a number of these shrine models, like those from Thessaly to the south, also have mysteriously shaped entrances, either inverted "T's" or triangular, Christmas tree- like shapes with cut-outs. Other temple models from the late sixth millen- nium b.c. Vinca culture of the central Balkans, and the Tisza culture just to the north in modern east- ern Hungary, are often distinctly bird-shaped with numerous incisions on their sides to indicate plu- mage. Their entrances are also provocative, with a round hole at the top of the front - again, like those found in birdhouses. Motifs of a bird goddess are found throughout the Vinca culture and Old Eur- ope in general, and it seems likely that these open- ings were fashioned as a symbolic entrance for the visiting bird goddess in the epiphany of a bird. One large model found on the altar of a house shrine of the Vésztô Mágor settlement in eastern Hungary is actually topped with a bird's head which has a wide-open beak. This Tisza bird shrine's conical body is incised with multiple V's, 42 Archaeology</page><page sequence="3">U nroofed clay model of one of SP the more elaborate shrines of Old Europe dating to the first half of the fourth millennium B.c.

Each side of the model is incised with triple protuberances which may stand for wings. The portrayals of a bird deity, a hybrid of the human female and a water bird, and water birds or owls, are already found in the Upper Palaeolithic. She is distinguished not only by her ornithomorphic fea- tures, but essentially by symbolic marks on her breasts and other parts of the body: V's, chevrons, parallel lines, meanders, bi-lines and triple lines. The same signs continue through the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, Copper Age and into the Aegean and Minoan Bronze Age. Starting with the earliest ag- ricultural period in the seventh millennium b.c., images of bird women are well documented; they dominate figurine art in the fifth millennium b.c. The consistent use of symbolic marks on her body, particularly on her breasts, mouth and eyes, point to the goddess as being the Dea Dator, the Dis- penser and Giver-of-All. From about 6000 b.c. onward, the Bird Goddess and her alter ego, the snake, are documented as a house shrine goddess. At Achilleion, a Sesklo site in Thessaly with a continuous habitation dating from about 6500 to 5800 b.c., she is worshipped within the house or shrine: bird women figurines were placed on stone bench altars in the sacred corner of the house. The "Lady Birds of Achilleion," one with a turban or neatly combed hair and another with a head band, were found on an altar of a stone house dated to about 6000-5900 b.c., together with other fragments possibly representing the same figurine type. A stone bench used as an altar is a regular feature of the Sesklo culture and the subsequent culture groups of Old Europe. In the Sesklo site itself, excavated in 1901, a two-room shrine or tem- ple was discovered. The left room contained a large stone bench and carbonized remains of two wooden pillars; the other room apparently served as a work- shop and storage space for the shrine. Cult figurines were not exclusively found in these house shrines, but were most frequently as- sociated with the courtyard which was used for grinding and baking. Domed ovens even had spe- cial platforms in front or at the side for the place- ment of figurines, cult vessels and lamps. More than 2,000 figurines, often depicting bird-shaped goddesses with beaked masks and arm-stumps for wings, have been found in the settlement of Vinča itself, 14 kilometers east of Belgrade. Over time, these figurines gradually grew more naturalistic with exquisite masks and rounded parts of the hu- man female body, but they never lost the distinctive imagery and characteristics that tied them to the unmistakably Old European religious and artistic tradition - a tradition that despite increasing con- tact with neighboring cultures continued to evolve throughout the fifth millennium b.c., along with temple building. These Old European artifacts were produced 2,000 years earlier than the develop- November/December 1980 43</page><page sequence="4">ment of Sumerian civilization and 3,000 years earlier than Minoan palace culture on Crete. In fact, the fifth millennium is the zenith of Old Euro- pean civilization, characterized by plastic art, highly sophisticated religious objects, ceremonial costume, and exquisite polychrome, graphite and gold painted vases, most of which were found in house shrines and temples of the theocratic and matrilinear society. The continuum of the Old European culture from the seventh through the fifth millennia is well documented by strati- graphies and typologies and can now be dated by several thousand radiocarbon dates. The physical • anthropological evidence indicates that most of the Chalcolithic Age (5500-4500 b.c.) and Copper Age (4500-3500 b.c.) population persisted from early Neolithic times and cultural efflorescence was es- sentially the product of local development. J^.n exquisite and unusually large temple model with numerous large round openings was discov- ered in the settlement on the Danube island of Cáscioarele in southern Romania. Dating to about 4500 b.c., this model has dramatically affected knowledge of Copper Age architectural and cult practices. This period is the optimum of the so- called Karanovo civilization. The harbor and trad- ing post at Varna on the Black Sea coast in Bul- garia, where a cemetery with some 4,000 gold ar- tifacts, copper tools, marble rhyta and dishes, shell beads, and obsidian blades, were discovered during the excavations of 1972-78, belongs to the same phase (see Archaeology 30 [1977]: 44-51). The cemetery was found near the wall of a fragmentary large seven by ten meter structure, probably a tem- ple, that contained a sacrificial area and numerous richly decorated and oddly-shaped cult vases. Among these were askoi or bird-shaped vessels. The shrine model itself consists of a large sub- structure supporting four individual temples, each of which has a wide arched portal crowned with horns. The façade is pierced by ten mysterious round apertures - perhaps windows or holes for the appearance of a goddess in the epiphany of a bird - and is decorated with irregular horizontally incised lines. This latter detailing suggests wood construc- tion. The top surface of the substructure probably constituted a terrace that could hold a large congre- gation. Presumably - if this was, as it surely seems to be, a model of an actual structure - the whole temple complex was at least ten meters tall, with the individual roof temples measuring about three meters in height. The structure is clearly of Euro- pean tradition and no close parallels to this config- uration exist except for a symbolic relationship to a stylized engraving of a Sumerian temple on a seal from Susa dating to about 3300 b.c. at least 1,000 years later. Other two-story temple models have been found at Old European settlements at Ruse on the lower Danube in Bulgaria, Izvoarele in Romania, and Azmak in central Bulgaria. Still another model, this time from the Ros River Valley at Rozsok- huvatka in the western Ukraine, depicts a two- story sanctuary standing on four legs, with the sec- ond floor comprising a temple of two rooms. This model, now at the Archaeological Institute in Kiev, is from the Cucuteni culture dating to about 4500- 4000 b.c., the farthest outpost of Old European civilization in the northeast. This culture is famous for the systematic excavations of whole villages with spacious houses of two to four rooms including altars and platforms, as well as its magnificent ceramic art. The model has wide entrances on both floors with a platform, adorned with bull horns and perhaps used for worship, in front of the large portal on the second floor. A round window appears in the rear and horizontal beams for roof support are indi- cated in relief. The temple walls of the Ruse model, and many others from Old Europe, were painted and provoca- tively decorated with incisions, excisions and en- crustations in symbolic motifs. Often these were arranged into panels in the same manner as seen on cult vases. The parallels between these forms are often particularly revealing. One of the dominant Old European motifs, for example, repeatedly found on both the models, cult vases and also other votive objects, is the meander or the figurative representa- tion of a snake, or sometimes its abstract derivative comprised of single or pairs of spiralling lines. A Vinca temple model from Gradešnica in northwestern Bulgaria, dating to about 5000 b.c., provides a good example of these symbolic decora- tions. Each wall and roof of this model constitutes a separate panel, each marked with a different design of meanders or sinuous lines, chevrons and dotted bands. The vertical panels on either side of the entrance are inscribed with numerous signs in a configuration that may comprise some sort of for- mula associated with the temple's goddess. The in- tertwined double spirals, for example, clearly re- semble the pairs of coiled snakes with opposed heads so often found on cult vessels. Frequently wrapped around a circular shape, these coiled lines comprise a creation symbol that would be cele- brated centuries later in Greece: procreative life energy wrapped around the cosmic egg. Above the temple model's entrance are bands of dots and zigzags - snake skin designs - further suggesting that the shrine belongs to a deity perhaps identifi- able as the Snake Goddess. Above the façade, a schematic head in the center probably represents the actual goddess, and the masked heads on the corners may symbolize her divine associates or epiphanies. The dynamic body of the snake is an allegory of regeneration, symbolism as old as the representa- tion of the snake in art with roots in Upper Palaeolithic times. From the sixth millennium b.c. onward, the snake coil plays an enormous role in Old European ceramic art. The symmetrical coils and fluid movements of the serpent were imitated 44 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">in incised, painted and channelled detailing on the outer or inner surfaces of shrine walls, altar screens, vases and figurines. At times, the heads of two snakes moving in opposite directions are jux- taposed. Lids and dishes are decorated with three symmetrical coils. The origin of the snake as the embodiment of the Snake Goddess, associated with the aquatic sphere and cosmogony, must be equally old, but the chronology of the emergence of the human female and snake hybrid is difficult to pin down. From the seventh millennium b.c. and throughout Neolithic times, the Snake Goddess is invariably portrayed in a squatting position with crossed legs; her arms and legs often lose human form and seem to become actual snakes, and her head is snake-like with a long ugly mouth. Through time images of this deity exhibit various degrees of anthropomorphism: she may be human with snake-like characteristics or ophidian costume, or she may be predominantly zoomorphic with only a few human characteristics. When attired, the Snake Goddess customarily wears an apron denoted by dots or spirals, and a skirt distinguished by checkerboard, net, bands or X's or lozenges. Three distinctive holes or lines on the neck or back appear to be another identifying mark. Snake curls or serpent heads as part of the diadem adorn the head of the goddess who, with her counterpart the Lady Bird, was considered to be the "Beautiful One." Whether celebrated as a separate snake or bird deity, or as a hybrid of the two, this Old European goddess was clearly an embodiment of the feminine life-giving principle. iSome shrine models of Old Europe only schemati- cally represent a façade. But on these plaques, too, various symbols and inscriptions similar to those November/December 1980 45</page><page sequence="6">Temple model in the shape of a bird's house from Romania. The meander de- sign suggests the goddess' association with water. Height, 40 centimeters. found on votive figurines seem to comprise a short- hand eulogizing a particular aspect of the life- giving goddess. Many stem from the Bulgarian Karanovo VI culture dating between 4500 and 4200 B.c. Most bear the spiral ideogram of the Snake Goddess in association with the net pattern or "snaking" bands of lozenges, and X's and zigzags, both water signs. Several tells in eastern Bulgaria have yielded clay model roof pillars from the first half of the fifth millennium b.c. which are also excised or encrusted with an elaborate series of symbols such as meanders - another sign for tor- rential water - parallel lines, triangles, lozenges, whirls and triple lines. Although otherwise com- plete, still other models are roofless, so it is possible to peer directly into the scene of the cult activities. The Karanovo shrine from Ovčarovo in northeast- ern Bulgaria, for example, has a dais along the back wall and a bread oven on the side wall - an associa- tion that will be heard from again. Symbolic signs incised in the outer walls include several chevrons, and also the V or water sign, which is often found on female breasts in votive statuary and is perhaps an identification of rain with milk. These same motifs are found in even more tel- ling detail in a roofless temple model from Po- pudnia, a late Cucuteni settlement north of Uman in the western Ukraine. The structure sits on four cylindrical legs and consists of a main room and vestibule; between them is a rectangular entrance with a threshold. On the right side of the large central chamber are benches and a large rectangu- lar oven on a raised platform. To the right of the , oven sits a female figurine with her hands on her breasts; near the outer wall another female figurine is grinding grain, and close by is a depression for storing flour. Almost in the center of the shrine stands a raised platform in the shape of a cross - an almost universal prehistoric symbol for the contin- uum of life - similar to the cruciform platforms found in some excavated Cucuteni houses. Un- doubtedly these were offering places, perhaps also used for the performance of mysteries. Another roofless Cucuteni model from Vladimi- rovka reveals elaborate patterns of concentric cir- cles, zigzag bands, and bands of chevrons and paral- lel lines converging in the center to form a chevron design. The model from Popudnia was also decor- ated with bands of black geometric designs consist- ing of diamonds flanked by chevrons. From all of these artifacts it seems clear that the Neolithic and certainly the Chalcolithic Old Europeans had de- veloped their own linear script for the expression of their deepest beliefs concerning the worship of the goddess. The script which emerged after 5500 b.c. and used in east-central Europe until about 4000 b.c., was modified by lines, curves and dots. It ap- pears on sacred objects and temple walls and not on tablets as in Mesopotamia. Some inscriptions dem- onstrate a maze of repetitive V's and M's or V's and Y's; they may be epithets, vows, prayers, or an assignment of gifts to the goddess. Old European script was a sacred script and has nothing to do with the much later commercial and administrative scripts of Mesopotamia. Widespread in the Vinca, Tisza, Karanovo and other cultural groups of Old Europe, it was formulated apparently in response to the increasing sophistication and intensification of the cult of the goddess, the Giver-of-All. As a rule, Neolithic and Chalcolithic houses with shrines did not differ in size or architecture from those without. But so far there is no informa- tion whether actual, separate temples were also built as early as the seventh millennium b.c. The dozens of temple models do suggest, however, that they may have appeared by the very end of this time. Regardless of the date of the temple's first appearance, several other recently excavated tem- ples and temple models have brought even more vivid detail to this once obscure religious world. One of these is a two-story temple uncovered near Razgrad in northeastern Bulgaria by Totju Ivanov of the Archaeological Museum, Razgrad in 1974 46 Archaeology</page><page sequence="7">The earliest fragments of wall paintings in Europe were found in the pillar temple ofCàscioarele in southern Romania including these pillars painted in reddish- brown on yellowish -white. through 1978. Probably similar to the four-legged Rozsokhuvatka model from the Ukraine, this Karanovo culture temple dates to about 5000 b.c. Its first floor had a ceramic workshop with a large oven to one side; on the other side was a clay platform with tools for making, polishing and dec- orating pots, flint blades and fine instruments of deer and bird bone. Flat stone containers for crush- ing ochre stood nearby. Exquisite finished vases and unbaked ones were also found in the room. Like the Rozsokhuvatka model, the second floor com- prised the temple proper. Inside was a large, rec- tangular clay altar 75 centimeters high, and to its left stood a vertical loom and many figurines and temple models. Interestingly, a number of the vases near the altar were filled with clay beads. One of the most exciting and unique Romanian discoveries was a pillar temple unearthed in the village of Càscioarele just below the model of the edifice. Excavated by H. and V. Dumitrescu of the Institute of Archaeology, Bucharest in 1962 through 1969, this Karanovo culture sanctuary dates from the early part of the fifth millennium B.c. Rectangular in plan, the 16 by 10 meter temple was divided by 6 rows of posts into 2 rooms. The interior of one has red painted walls with bands of cream-colored curvilinear designs; a striking ter- racotta medallion with a painted red snake coil outlined by a thin line of cream appears above the entrance.

The thicker one, which served no obvious architectural purpose, was encircled by posts and, like the walls, had been repainted three times with different designs. Near it lay an adult skeleton in a crouched position which may have been a dedicatory sacrifice. The thinner pillar, measuring about ten centimeters in diameter, stood close to the interior wall and was painted with cream ribbons on a reddish-brown background. Next to it was a terracotta bench or dais about 40 centimeters high with painted curvilinear ribbons of cream color. Nearby lay numerous fragments of painted vases and large pithoi or storage vessels decorated with excised motifs. Rituals or mysteries performed here were probably connected with the idea of regeneration and the invocation of the vital source of life. The pillars decorated with the run- ning angularized spiral or snake motif, symbolic of cosmic waters or their mistress, can be interpreted as "columns of life" - a motif that had a tradition from the seventh millennium Çatal Hiiyiik frescoes in central Anatolia down to the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. In representations on Old European vases, "life columns" are usually shown within an egg and are flanked with horns, whirls, spirals and uterus symbols. The haunting remains of an early Cucuteni shrine in Sabatini vka in the southern Bug Valley of the Ukraine evoke an even more dramatic picture. A rectangular building of about 70 square meters, this temple has a clay-plastered floor and an en- trance area paved with flat stones. The center of the room contains the now familiar large oven with a female figurine at its base. Nearby stood an incense burner and a group of vessels; these included a dish containing the burnt bones of an ox and a channel- decorated pot with a small cup inside once used for libations. Also nearby was a group of five saddle- quern grinding stones and five seated terracotta figurines with their bodies leaning backward. Along the rear wall, 16 other female figurines were seated on a large, six-meter-long altar in low horned-back chairs. In the corner adjacent to the altar stood a clay throne with a horned-back sup- port and a meter-wide seat which had originally been covered with split planks. Altogether, 32 of these nearly identical, armless figurines with mas- sive thighs and snake-shaped heads were found in this sanctuary - oddly, several of them had been perforated through the shoulders, and one held a baby snake, or phallic symbol. Together with the evidence from Neolithic Achilleion and the roofless models of miniature temples, the Sabatinivka sanctuary demonstrates that bread ovens, grinding stones and storage ves- sels played a fundamental role in the cult rites of Old European shrines. The seated figurines strongly suggest that temple worshippers partici- pated in a ritual grinding of grain and baking of sacred bread, and that these ceremonies were supervised from a throne, at least at Sabatinivka, by an overseer, probably a priestess. It seems likely that sacred cakes were dedicated to the goddess at the conclusion of the rites. During these rituals, the clay figurines on the altar may have also been pre- sented as votive offerings to the goddess or were used as effigies to celebrate her presence. These images of cult practices are further il- luminated by a site near Trgovište in northeastern Bulgaria excavated by Henrieta Todorova of the Institute of Archaeology, Sofia in 1971. Possibly associated with the Sabatinivka roofless shrine model, this Karanovo culture house shrine site at Ovčarovo dates to about 4500-4200 b.c. Although somewhat burned, the site yielded remains of 26 miniature cult objects including four figurines with 48 Archaeology</page><page sequence="9">Clay model of an edifice from Càscioarele, an island settlement west ofOltenita in southern Romania.

It seems possible that this large collec- tion of objects may have been used in different groupings at various times in answer to the re- quired tableau of each particular ceremony. The Ovčarovo shrine façades or altar screens were decorated with a variety of symbols such as chevrons, triple lines and spirals around a central motif of concentric circles - the usual symbols for the Bird Goddess; the four figurines, on the other hand, were painted with meanders and parallel lines. But most interesting was the presence of drums, which suggests the ritual use of music and dance in Old Europe. Other cult objects include the miniature vessels with lids found on small tables . where they may have been used as sacrificial con- tainers. Slightly larger than the figurines, these dishes or basins may have served for some form of lustration or spiritual cleansing during the cere- mony. The nine chairs, finally, could possibly have been used to seat three of the figurines - the fourth is larger than the others - alternately at the three altars, three tables or the three drums. These miniature replicas are particularly im- portant because lifesize Old European altars and tables holding sacrificial equipment have rarely November/December 1980 49</page><page sequence="10">An actual shrine from Sabati - nivka, Soviet Moldavia dating to the mid-fifth millennium b.c.

Fortunately, however, recent exca- vations at Pianul de Jos, a Petresti culture settle- ment near Hunedora in Transylvania, have yielded a clay-plastered triangular wooden table and a com- plex of vases designed for different purposes - "fruitstands," jars, dishes and lids. It can be pre- sumed that all of these vessels had one unifying function: sacrificial offerings. Similar accumula- tions of vases in a number of other Cucuteni, Kara- novo, and Vinca house shrines also seem to repre- sent storage deposits awaiting special occasions. Although merely a selection in themselves, all of these Old European temple sites demonstrate that a long and varied list of cult paraphernalia - sacrificial containers, lamps, altar tables and plaques, libation vases, ladles, incense burners and figurines - could be employed in worship rituals. While the rite of sacred breadmaking appears to have been among the most consecrated and perva- sive practices, there may well have been many ad- ditional distinct categories of religious ceremonies. No doubt there was a richness and diversity to the temple world of Old Europe that will take years to unravel. Archaeologists are just beginning to de- cipher the development, for example, of other deities that arose beside the dominant Snake and Bird Goddess, and new inroads on the once "un- knowable" realm of Old European temple worship are being forged. From the symbols to the tiny clay figurines to the temples themselves, the sophistica- tion and meaning of this remarkable architectural and religious tradition is becoming steadily more apparent. Long before there was a Greece, Old European culture was establishing some of its deepest and most enduring roots in the soils of Europe. di« (BitotfArchaeological Museum, I960), is an exca- ' fronti^ IMhalf of the ai*Üi milkninhim rc- a site ' In liru mimfirr of rim temple protomes, zoomorphic con- ols^eeto'i»»eâ in cu» worship; is a popular report in French on , Itfjlftlrn militili 'iwrfhwTirt- Bulgaria; Demetrios R. i 1973), kahmnfeus publication with ■fr|áÍO(^ir^&gt;]is^tt»SeskloaiidDiniinicul- - • «pteMiif« Henrieta Todorova, 0e- iW«»(Iadatetetvo "Septem vri," Solte 1976), eon- í~Wjí¡i 1988-1975 excavations at Ov- % • tppctt brtNwrt» T&amp;jfoviitei^ Unlgü!^ wlHi'n ^imtiiüiy fo French. 50 Archaeology</page></plain_text>
