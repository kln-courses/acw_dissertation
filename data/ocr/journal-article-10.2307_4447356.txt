<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMALS IN EDUCATION: THE USE OF ANIMALS IN HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASSES AND SCIENCE FAIRS by Heather McGiffin and Nancie Brownley, eds. 1980. The institute for the Study of Animal Problems (2100 L Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20037). 160p. $9.95. A conference was held by The Institute for the Study of Animal Problems, part of the Humane Society of the United States, in Washington, D.C., September 27-28, 1979. Although the conference theme is admirable, and does finally get to a short discussion of the philo- sophical, sometimes mundane, debate over animal legal and moral rights, the twenty-position papers in Animals in Education are mostly to support more legislation against the use of live verte- brates in classrooms. Twenty-four parti- cipants are identified, and possibly ten others attended. Students and teachers are conspicuously absent. Papers were given by persons from associations, institutes, universities, and laboratories. Pity the directors of Science Service, Inc., and The National Society for Medical Research. Try as they could to identify the pitfalls and disadvantages of over- regulation, they were hopelessly out- numbered by the imbalanced conferees in favor of more and stronger legislation. Consequently, the book is a biased accounting of the support for discon- tinuing the use of live animals, including tadpoles, eggs, and frogs. A significant, probably deliberate, omission from the papers is a firm position that "A person may not engage in, sponsor, or promote any public school project or course of study that may in- terfere with the life, well-being, or com- fort of living vertebrate animals." This was in a proposed state law before a 1980 legislature. It was soundly de- feated by local science educators and student testimony of the crippling effect it would have on vocational animal nutrition studies, high school laboratory internships, student research activities at community research facilities, advanced placement biology courses, science fair projects and other science competitions, and probably teacher morale. Yet, this is the message that must be read between the lines of the compassionate appeals in Animals in Education for more hu- mane treatment of animals. All of the conference papers, pro and con, con- demn cruel and senseless injury to ani- mals. The adversaries of animal use in schools are right-to-life missionaries, mostly British or British-system sympa- thizers. Because the British pioneered animal welfare legislation and societies to protect animals, this is understandable. Their zeal is not revealed in this book. One must hear the legislative testimony recently given by a conferee that chances of an elementary or high school student making a discovery are remote. Another, in print elsewhere, stated "science fairs have had their day" and science educa- tion would be better if "they were phased out." Horror stories of public animal abuse, indirectly attributed to poor public school education, and vicious con- demnations of teachers abound in animal rights newsletters, but are not cited here. In one, a conferee's position is that human volunteers should be used to test for possible cosmetic allergies rather than shaving cats' faces. Emotion and anthropomorphism seem to have clouded the credibility of some presenters who are veterinarians, physio- logists, biomedical researchers, and other scientists. Like the Ph.D.s who advocate teaching creationism as valid as evolution theory, their credentials are worn on their sleeves, as if to broadcast and 468 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 43, NO. 8, NOVEMBER 1981</page><page sequence="2">guarantee that their positions must be accepted by all listeners. All biology teachers must 'become adversaries, or advocates, for more animal rights legislation; however, they must not use only Animals in Education to become learned. Although this is in no way an endorsement, and in fact, is not an appeal to purchase a copy, I strongly urge reading Animal Rights by Patricia Curtis (Four Winds Press: N.Y., 1980) to feel the full impact of the intense and venomous accusations against teachers by the animal right-to- lifers to promote their ban on all uses of animals, including research studies in medicine. There are already sound guidelines on animal use in classrooms from presti- gious science education, medical, and research associations, as well as state and federal laws such as the U.S. Animal Welfare Act. One conferee stated "edu- cate, don't regulate." Don't allow isolated incidences of animal abuse to be used to condemn all animal use. Teachers have already been demoralized by being told they are not qualified, implying also they are not moral enough, to determine whether live animal use is appropriate. This is to be done only by a "qualified biomedical scientist," which I have yet to see adequately defined for possible litigation proceedings that will surely come from more legislation. Unanswered is "Where will it end?" Probably next is to disallow the use of preserved speci- mens since they result from killing ani- mals. One conferee states this position. My dilemma as a reviewer is to not recommend the purchase of Animals in Education because of the moral and ethical impropriety of contributing to a political activists' association; however, its messages are too important to ignore and should be read by every teacher of biology and other life sciences. To para- phrase Erasmus, whether one is pro or con, to do battle with lions, one must don the cloak of Hercules. John R.
