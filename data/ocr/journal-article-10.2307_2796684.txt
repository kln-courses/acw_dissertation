Vdlk.), i959. 193 P Ip.i83, 23 plates, 70 textfigs., maps IEsthetically and artistically this book achieves a high standard both in general and in respect of the reproduction of the paintings and drawings on rock and bark and the ornamented objects. Far from giving an idealized impression of the painting and decoration in question these highly refined illustrations are so true and naturalistic that they can easily serve any scholarly purpose. This applies to both photographs and drawings. The latter are by Mrs. Katharina Lommel. The copies which she made of the pictures and compositions on the rock-walls deserve special mention. Table 2 shows how this was done. The book is based on personal research in the field and in Australian museum collections and on a profound study of the literature on the subject. With regard to the rock paintings the authors distinguish two main styles: the 'geometrical-linear' style with its centre in the south-west and the middle of the continent and a scattered occurrence in the north-east, in Queensland, and in New South Wales; and the ' naturalistic' style which is found in the north and in the south-east corner of Australia. In the Kimberley district, which is the north-west part of the second area, two sub-styles occur, called the wondschina style and the 'elegant' style. The former is characterized by rather clumsy- looking anthropomorphic figures whose faces, showing only nose and eyes, are enclosed by a horseshoe-shaped design. The 'elegant' style is also dominated by anthropomorphic figures. They are, how- ever, much more slender and have more sense of movement than the wondschina, and show a certain resemblance to the human figures of the Spanish and South African rock paintings. The impressive stylized picture on the dust cover of the book belongs to this group. Another sub-style which is, in many respects, comparable with the ' elegant' style of Kimberley presents itself in Arnhem Land. Here also the characteristic X-ray paintings of animals are found. The two main styles, as well as the various sub-styles, are very well described and characterized and brilliantly illustrated. The argument is supported by a great many notes referring to books and articles which may lead the interested reader to studies of a more detailed kind. The book culminates in a consideration of factors outside Australia which may have influenced the origin of these art styles, particularly of the 'elegant' style of Kimberley and the X-ray style of Arnhem Land. In discussing whether the rock paintings at issue may be related to those in Europe, mention is made of the representation of boomerangs and spear-throwers in palxeolithic caves in the south of France. Their distribution is shown on two maps. The hypothesis is offered that the boomerang and the spear-thrower have been carried from Western Europe to Australia. The data available to the author, however, fail to demonstrate this. This is particularly clear with regard to the spear-thrower. Outside Western Europe this weapon is found among the Eskimo, in various areas in the Americas, along the north-east coast of Asia, in Micronesia, New Guinea and Australia. This is, however, by no means a continuous route. There is also, for instance, much difference between the types of spear- thrower used by the Eskimo and by the Marind-anim of southern New Guinea. It is therefore, I believe, difficult to maintain that the migration route of the X-ray style to Australia could be identified by the route taken by the spear-thrower (p. I 59). This is all the more improbable since the route by which this art style is assumed to have migrated is divergent, i.e. also from Western Europe via Siberia to North America. Many scholarly readers will disagree with these kulturhistorische interpretations. For them the book will still be an extraordinarily useful source for important aspects of Australian aboriginal art. They will be very thankful indeed for the well ordered presentation of this interesting material. S. KOOIJMAN The History of the Tahitian Mission, 1799-I830. By John Davies, edited by C. W. Newbury. Hakluyt Soc., 2nd Ser., No. I94 CXVI. Cambridge (U.P.), I96I. Pp. 392, 4 maps, Price /?2 A masterpiece of editorial work has been presented to the public by Dr. C. W. Newbury. The Rev. John Davies's history of the Tahitian mission, until now a manuscript in the library of the London Missionary Society, has been published at last, with admir- able accuracy and the addition of supplementary notes and docu- ments. The editor is to be congratulated on his excellent work. Part of this praise is due to the Research School of Pacific Studies (Canberra) and to Professor J. W. Davidson, whose pupils form a school of expert historians of the Pacific. Considerable material referring to the progress of missionary work in Tahiti has been previously published; accordingly, a general view of the development could be obtained by the reader familiar with older documents. Davies is able, however, to give a wealth of new details, and editorial comments make this material very valuable. For an anthropologist the work is not, perhaps, so useful as for a historian, but it does yield many data referring to old heathenism and vanishing customs. Religious change is clearly described, although the writers' approach is not always quite objective. John Davies arrived in Tahiti with the second group of mission- aries in I799. During the years of frustration and danger, he stayed for some time in Australia, but then returned to Mo'orea (Eimeo)' and witnessed the triumph of Christianity and the resulting change. In a simple and honest way he relates the history of the kingdom of the Pomares until the early years of the reign of Pomare IV. Dr. Newbury, the most outstanding expert on the history of Tahiti, is amazing in his accuracy, notably in respect of the ortho- graphy of Tahitian names. His use of the hamzah (') for lost k and ng consonants seems to be quite correct, except in some cases where the lost consonant was at the beginning of a word. For documentation of the history of Polynesia the work is more than welcome. AARNE A. KOSKINEN</page></plain_text>
