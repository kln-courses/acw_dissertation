The immediate "we all" in Jens question comprises the Asian Americans - Chinese NOTE: My personal and intellectual debt to Fredric Jameson and, in particular, Walter Mignolo can't be adequately expressed here, but I must thank them for their generosity in sharing their ideas with me and encouraging my intellectual adventures.

The one count for which Lee plea-bargained was about the mishandling of classified data in the lab; in all likelihood, the plea bargain was proposed by the prosecutors as a face-sav- ing way out. In the release statement, Judge James Parker apologized to Lee and severely took to task both the U.S. government and its prosecutors for trumping up so many groundless charges and successfully dissuading him earlier from granting Lee bail for reasons of threat to U.S. national security. A host of apologies and regrets followed in the aftermath of Lees release, including the Times s editorial regrets about not following proper journalis- tic procedures in reporting Lees case to the U.S. public when it first broke about a year ago.3 In the Op-Ed, Jen expresses her outrage that Lee was put in solitary confinement for nine months just because he was an Asian American, even though born in Taiwan, "an island not known for its adora- tion of Beijing." A couple of points are in order here. One, Gish Jen has come to be known now both in public and in the newly emerging disciplinary studies at U.S. universities as an Asian American writer. In such works of fiction as Typical American (1991), Mona in the Promised Land (1996), and Who is Irish ? (1999), Jen has charted the traumas and tribulations, pleasures and pains of migra- tion, living and adjusting of various ethnic groups, especially Asian Americans, in the United States. Thus, in the excerpt above, the melting pot ideal of assimilation that privileges both a magnetized nationalistic core and its discourse appears dear and desirable to her. Two, the injustice of which Jen writes in the Times could have happened to any so-called ethnic group in the United States. A look at the history of the U.S. nation-state formation makes it amply clear that marginalization and discrimination have consti- tuted the ideology of assimilation of the U.S. nation-state despite the noble sentiments of the founding document of the union, the Declaration of</page><page sequence="3">Pramod K. Mishra • 215 Independence. At one time or another Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Jewish Americans, and so on have been treated not very differently from what Jen speaks about Asian Americans - mistreatment of the minority by the majoritarian structure and ideology within the political, economic, and cultural framework of the U.S. national imaginary. The case of the African Americans, who have borne the major brunt of the oppression and discrim- ination of this kind, is a classic example in the history of the United States. Perhaps Jens outrage stems from the fact that this new discrimination was meted out not to the descendant of a slave or refugee but to a member of the Asian American community, which has been held up as a model minority, a group whose example every other ethnic community- particularly the African Americans and Hispanic Americans- has been implicitly asked to emulate. There is, however, a subtle difference between the earlier discriminations and the one Jen complains about in her Times piece. The prejudice against the Italian Americans, Irish Americans, or Jewish Americans in their peak times did not stem from the stigma attached to the places they migrated from. The places of their migration became vitiated despite the glorious mythical representations of those places because they looked darker (Mediterranean in the Italian case), looked slightly different and had been biblically stigmatized (the Jews), or practiced a different version of the same faith (the Irish). Ireland, Italy, or Israel (which didn't exist then in physical reality) had very little to do with the treatment meted out to the Italians, the Jews, or the Irish. If anything, Roman civilization and the myth of the Promised Land after the Israel of biblical times formed part and parcel of the mainstream U.S. national imaginary. The constructed discourse and imagi- nary of the national self had sought to define itself against the encroach- ment of the other with the variables of skin tone, biblical stigma, denominational difference, and class. In Wen Ho Lees case, however, the problem of class did not exist; rather, it was both how he looked and the putative place he came from that contributed, for Jen, to his predicament in the United States. That is why, declares Jen, "China is the new bogeyman." In fact, one would go so far as to suggest that it is not so much how he looked but where he supposedly came from that had created Lees problems,</page><page sequence="4">216 • All the World was America because after the Japan of the World War II years and the Soviet Union of the Cold War years, China has become the new bogeyman for the United States, according to Jen. Jens bewilderment ("How is it, though, that we all rise and fall with the tide of countries we may never have seen?") evinces at once the helplessness of forced identification with and intertwined fortune of a distant land ("countries we may have never seen ') and the need for per- manent severance to end this forced umbilical cord with the unseen coun- try. But, by default, this also signifies a desire to validate the structure of the nation-state by the reverse move of severance from the distant land and identification and assimilation with the nationalist ideology and structure of the United States. The narrative of marginalization and discrimination versus assimilation brilliantly plays out in Jens longing for belonging. The genealogy of this helplessness about identification and intertwined fortune with distant lands in the post-Soviet global geopolitics is the point I want to take up below. PART I: NATURE'S NATION IN MATERIAL HISTORY The birth of the United States of America as the first modern nation based explicitly and fully on Lockean principles of the compact between the gov- ernor and the governed occurred according to the enlightenment principle of natural law laid down in the preamble of its founding document, the Declaration of Independence. This invocation to the Newtonian cosmology of orderly nature was made in order to realize that order in human society, the empirical world of Locke in which the order of the natural world would be the ideal toward which human society would aspire. Before Newton, nature had been perceived as wild, unpredictable, violent, and chaotic, a force that needed to be brought to manageable form through religious ritu- als, figures, and cosmologies presided over by a religious God or other spir- its. But the Newtonian physics displaced the old religious order. Now, a secular, scientific universalism reigned. And so at different times, including Gish Jens Op-Ed outrage, the universalist sentiments of this founding docu- ment of the United States, embedded in principles of natural law, have been</page><page sequence="5">Pramod K. Mishra • 217 implicitly or explicitly invoked in order to raise an outcry against injustice and amend political, legal, and cultural practices in the United States, and to reshape and reconceptualize the definition of the United Statess nation- alist imaginary.4 The document that has come to constitute such a funda- mental core of the clear-cut, well-packaged nation, however, embodies the contradictions found in Jeffersons use and deployment of nature and natu- ral-law philosophy to legitimate his emerging nation. First, Jefferson invokes the scientific, secular, and cosmopolitan realm of nature ("the laws of nature and natures God") in order to legitimate the local and the particular- the nation. Second, the invocation to the cosmopolitan, universalist philosophy of nature enables Jefferson to sever ties with what Europe symbolized at the time - monarchy, aristocracy, and other kinds of artificial distinctions and statuses. It was an attempt to get away from the compact between Christianity and monarchy that characterized political arrangements in Europe. But, as Joyce Appleby points out, Jeffersons definition and use of nature was contradictory. In Appleby's words, "The exclusion of women, blacks, and native Americans from the liberal crusades raises a provocative thought. Was there something in the Jeffersonian creed which licensed this?"5 As an answer to this question, Appleby refers to Jeffersons contradictory interpretation and deployment of the theory of nature for the paradox in Jeffersons life and principles as found both in the Declaration and his Notes on the States of Virginia, To quote Appleby again, "The assertion of an underlying uniformity in the face of conspicuous human differences had enabled the Jeffersonians to enlist nature in the war against hierarchical society. Claiming to interpret the laws of nature, Jefferson had created a complex intellectual tradition that linked the American nation to a grand human destiny, but the association of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness with a uniform human nature bode ill for those deemed naturally different."6 This conflictual move between the universality of the grand aspiration for the nation and the application of that universal principle of human nature to those who were deemed different came as a revolutionary secular break of liberalism with the old tradition that allowed space for the exis- tence of various levels of hierarchies, ethnic groups, regional identities, and</page><page sequence="6">218 • All the World was America so on, as we will further see in the next section. This liberal secular univer- salism of science, reason, and nature did away with the old distinctions and applied and celebrated the universal principles of equality to all free men, except where, in Jefferson's words, "the difference is fixed in nature."7 Appleby is right in pointing out the paradoxical interpretation and deployment of nature in Jefferson. I would, moreover, want to extend further the implication of this contradiction of Eurocentric liberalism to the cen- trality of the genealogy of the nation itself. The paradox lies at the heart of the history and epistemology of the nation-state, that quintessential twin of capitalism in modernity, a contradictory entity that sits uneasily but power- fully between cosmopolitanism and particularism, between the universalist equalitarianism of nature and its application to human difference, and between universalist philosophy and material history. Democracy, nationalism, capitalism, and modernist Christianity that allied itself with the ideologies of politics and economics- all these found their articulation in the tenure of modernity and began their life in the six- teenth century, coming to full ideological bloom and articulation in the eigh- teenth century with the French and American revolutions and the founding of the North American republic of the United States. This alliance of the political, economic, and religious had its roots in the Renaissance and Reformation and in the realization of Europe's smallness and even insigni- ficance in the aftermath of the Crusade and travels by Marco Polo that opened up the knowledge of a whole new world of highly sophisticated and prosperous interregional systems in Asia.8 But after Columbus and Vasco de Gamas search for Eldorado, which was India, the projects of capitalism and the Enlightenment notion of God and nature made liberal democracy their ally explicitly for the first time and in full measure in the American revolu- tion as embodied in the Declaration. "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi- ness" of the Declaration crystallized the political formulations and debates first articulated, after the Magna Carta, in John Locke's Two Treatises of Government (1690). The ratification of the Declaration and the publication of Adam Smith's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations were twins in more ways than just the year of their birth (1776). But how is it that democracy, nationalism and nation-state, and capitalism came</page><page sequence="7">Pramod K. Mishra • 219 to advance a double project of modernity- prosperity and coloniality, pros- perity for some through the colonization of others?9 I examine John Locke's works and career, the ideological framework of the Declaration of Independence, and William Bartrams Travels from a postcolonial perspective in order to reveal their hidden paradoxes that char- acterize the project of modernity as embodied in the notion of national progress and national justice that has caused Gish Jens bewilderment. In examining Locke, the Declaration of Independence, and Bartrams Travels in light of their grounding in the colonial problematic, I am not the first to point out the double nature of the Enlightenment discourse, but what I'm pointing out is the centrality of Gish Jens bewilderment as a prod- uct of the questioning and understanding of that modernity's quintessential product as manifested in the Western hemisphere. Part II: Tainted Genealogy?10 Whether Thomas Jefferson had a copy of Locke's Two Treatises in front of him or not when he drafted the Declaration is a moot point, although schol- ars have speculated and made much of this presence or absence. What is certain, and the scholars agree on this, is that Jefferson was heavily influenced by Locke's ideas on toleration, the compact between the governor and the governed, and the theory of natural law that Locke had formulated following Newton's discoveries. So the genealogy of the paradox in the Declaration went back to the career and works of John Locke, particularly his Two Treatises (1690). Locke was a complex figure with multiple, conflicting interests and ideas. But the representation of his ideas and his influence on subsequent historical events in the career of liberal democracy has been more or less one-sided. He has been seen as a purely European figure engaged in pro- pounding his ideas and theories, based on observation and experience, about European events for European consumption. Even a prominent Locke scholar like Peter Laslett commits the same ideological oversight. For exam- ple, in his introduction to The Two Treatises of Government, Laslett enthu- siastically declares, "But like every other man, he thought his important</page><page sequence="8">220 • All the World was America thoughts when he was young. The fascination and difficulty of his career is to recognize the seeds and saplings burgeoning in his early and middle life and to watch them grow and spread into the mature forest trees which he left to posterity."11 Laslett exhaustively explores these seeds and saplings of Lockes later thoughts through extensive research and finds them squarely grounded in Lockes association with Anthony Ashley Cooper (later Lord Shaftesbury) and his political career. So far, so good- Lockes career indeed was shaped by his at times propitious, at times dangerous, association with this impor- tant British aristocrat. But the significance of this association does not lie in Lockes association with Shaftesbury and its significance for British poli- tics-at least it does not end there; it only begins. The significance of this association lies in Lockes colonial career that became possible because of this association. To emphasize the colonial side of Lockes career of course is not to elide his involvement in mainstream English politics through once again his association with Lord Shaftesbury, but to point out the inevitable and inextricable nature of the two: inevitable, because the twin principles of modernity- nationalism and capitalism- had to lead to imperialism; inex- tricable, because modernity and coloniality are the two sides of the same coin.12 And the implication of this inextricability means the conflictive nature of colonialism itself, at the heart of whose operation lay a conflict between the national conscious and the cosmopolitan unconscious. In examining Locke s career and works, I want to focus on two aspects: this ten- sion between cosmopolitanism and nationalism, and Lockes obsession with the Americas in, among other places, The Two Treatises and what that obses- sion means to Lockes cultural importance to us. In Culture and Imperialism , Edward Said elaborates his theory of con- trapuntal reading, a method of interpretation by which Said excavates the silences, the fissures, and the gaps in the European texts and restores their hidden sides for a full understanding of the historicity of the text. Said's method is a mixture of Fredric Jamesons call for historicizing and of recep- tion theory. In the act of historicizing, the text s meaning is derived through a double move of the dialectic: simultaneously critiquing its ideology and, in this dialectical assertion of the act of reading, imagining a Utopian future.</page><page sequence="9">Pramod K. Mishra • 221 Reception theory, in a complementary move, posits meaning not so much in the textuality of the text but in its realization in the reader through the reader s repertoire of personal and historical experiences and horizon of expectations.13 According to Said, "we must be able to think through and interpret together experiences that are discrepant, each with its particular agenda and pace of development, its own internal formations, its internal coherence and system of external relationships" (32). 14 A reader here becomes the processing consciousness that provides coherent meaning to the historically fragmented, repressed, and silenced through contrapuntal interpretation. "In the counterpoint of Western classical music, various themes play off one another, with only a provisional privilege being given to any particular one; yet in the resulting polyphony there is concert and order, an organized interplay that derives from the themes, not from the rigorous melodic or formal principle outside the work" (51). Said further goes on to state that the "point is that contrapuntal reading must take account of both processes, that of imperialism and that of resistance to it, which can be done by extending our reading of the texts to include what was once forcibly excluded In addition, one must connect the structures of a narrative to the ideas, concepts, experiences from which it draws support" (66-67). By contrapuntally reading Locke's texts that are said to have provided a philo- sophical framework for political democracy and foundation for liberalism in England first and then everywhere else in a universalist mode, we can break the "consolidated wall of denial" (40) and bring Locke's mainstream, universalist texts out of their "autonomous enclosures" to the "dynamic global environment created by imperialism" (51). Reading Locke in this way with a "simultaneous awareness both of the metropolitan history that is narrated and of those other histories against which (and together with which) the dominating discourse acts," we can bring out the unavoidable historical fact of postmodern/postcolonial condition of "overlapping terri- tories, intertwined histories" (61). In this scheme, thus, Locke's dominant texts written with an eye for European consumption and use cannot be seen in isolation from either the hidden subtexts of these texts or from his neglected texts written for, say, the Carolinas. Furthermore, the texts he wrote with an eye to achieving a political purpose in Europe or England</page><page sequence="10">222 • All the World was America cannot be seen without the light shed by his colonial career, whose signa- ture is visible everywhere in the dominant text, namely The Two Treatises , that has come to be known as the first elaboration of liberal democracy. When we juxtapose these two divergent, for Said "discrepant," aspects of Locke's intellectual life- his material life and philosophical output- we then get a comprehensive, historicized picture of Locke's thoughts - as well as that of the very nature of textuality in modernity enmeshed in multiple, divergent sites of production and reception. Moreover, we also gain an understanding of the inevitable transatlantic, transregional nature of colo- niality that is the hidden side of the national imaginary, both in its outward expansionist mode and in its inward marginalization of the internal other. This is why I read Locke's Two Treatises of Government (1690) not only in light of The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina (1669), which he wrote right at the outset of his career, but also in light of his overall career that occupied various colonial positions in the officialdom of the time and was informed epistemologically and materially by the already well-established imperial network between Africa, England, and the Americas, an important precedent to the careers of many of his nineteenth-century countrymen such as James and John Mill. At the heart of Locke's liberalism lies a contradiction, which remains unresolved even in our times. Locke's entire career is torn between the national and the cosmopolitan- or better yet, his one leg is always planted in what is not Europe and European, namely, the colonial world of the Americas and Africa, and the other in his ostensible metropolitan concerns. This tension in his career between the exigencies of everyday life and need to survive by occupying positions for England's expanding overseas territories in the Americas, and the imperative of philosophy and historical events in England and Europe to propound theories and ideas that essentially became cast in European colors, defines both Locke's oeuvre and its reception. The ostensible purpose of his seminal work of political philosophy, The Two Treatises of Government , is to refute Robert Filmer s arguments in Patriarcha that justified the divine rights of kings. In the First Treatise, Locke refutes Filmer's Adamic principle of sovereignty that combines father- hood and property by separating them as different and mutually contesting</page><page sequence="11">Pram o d K. Mishra • 223 sources of sovereignty. In order to demolish Filmer s Judeo-Christian frame- work, Locke draws upon his knowledge of competing cosmologies. Filmer had argued, "Most of the Civillest Nations of the Earth, labor to fetch their Original from some of the Sons and Nephews of Noah." To this universal validity of the biblical story, Locke advances the pluralist model. In his words, "How many do most of the civillest Nations amount to? and who are they? I fear the Chineses, a very great and civil People, as well as several other People of the East, West, North and South, trouble not themselves much about this matter. All that believe the Bible, which I believe are our As most of the civillest Nations , must necessarily derive themselves from Noah , but for the rest of the World, they think little of his Sons and Nephews' (283).15 After a sudden turn in the argument in which Locke maintains that it is not divine right but individual virtue that ought to be the criterion for great- ness for posterity, Locke reverts to the pluralist argument once again. "But if it were Orgygis , Hercules , Brama , Tamberlain, Pharamond; nay, if Jupiter and Saturn were the Names, from whence divers races of Man, both Ancient and Modern, have labourd to derive their Original; will that prove that those Men enjoyed the Lordship of Adam, by right descending to them?' Yet it could be argued that despite this pluralist, liberal position, Locke's pervasive use of the term "Slavery" as "so vile and miserable an Estate of Man" remains applicable hypothetically only to Englishmen and could not go beyond to apply to the real slaves of the time, namely, people of African descent. This contradiction is further evidenced in Locke in his pervasive reference to America as a land not only empty but beyond the reckoning of available knowledge. On the one hand, Locke refutes Filmer s endorsement of Noah's division of the world - " That some say it was by lot , and others that Noah saiVd round Mediterranean in Ten years, and divided the world into Asia, Africa and Europe, Portions for his three sons. America then, it seems, left to be his that could catch it" (284). Furthermore, this argument refutes Filmer s theory of supremacy of the biblical provenance of sovereignty. On the other, Locke's ambiguous yet obsessive concern with America and silence about the humanity of the Indian speaks of the historical blindness of modernity that created the division between the subject and object of knowl- edge, between the knower and the known. At yet another level, America "left</page><page sequence="12">224 • All the World was America to be his that could catch it" could be interpreted as belonging to those who fall outside the purview of the biblical paradigm- namely, the proponents of the emerging Enlightenment secularism that would transform the discourse of Christianizing into civilizing the other of Europe.16 PART III: AMERICA AS PROPERTY "Thus Labour , in the Beginning, gave a Right of Property, where-ever any one was pleased to imploy it, upon what was common, which remained, a long while, the far greater part, and is yet more than Mankind makes use of" (341). "Thus in the beginning all the World was America (343) In a nutshell, these two excerpts sum up Locke's idea of property and his the- ory of sovereignty based on the ownership of property in his Second Treatise. The First Treatise makes the Old Testament and its hero Adam the foils for a refutation of the claim of sovereignty based on divine rights as propounded by Robert Filmer in Patriarcha . One by one, patiently and meticulously, Locke refutes the various roles of a family patriarch - husband, father, mas- ter, and creator- in the biblical person of Adam as a basis of property and so of sovereignty. Locke at first draws his examples from the "inhabited" old civilizations, as mentioned above, in order to both use and refute Filmers patriarchal family model of political arrangement based in the Judeo- Christian cosmology and tradition that Filmer relies on. Then, Locke invokes a civilizational model of cosmopolitan plurality as a ground upon which divine rights of sovereignty cannot stand. In the Second Treatise, however, the scene shifts. The Adamic model of patriarchy and its authority over sovereignty that Locke refutes in the First Treatise is now replaced by Locke s exposition of his own ideas of property and sovereignty. Whereas in the First Treatise Lockes pluralism and cos- mopolitanism are based on his invocation of other civilizations, in the Second Treatise the scene and the terms of the argument change. In order to refute Filmers reliance on Adam as a source of sovereignty, Locke there invokes the various cosmologies of peoples in other parts of the world, both</page><page sequence="13">Pramod K. Mishra • 225 ancient and modern. By the rest of the world, what Locke has in mind are peoples of the old civilizations. These peoples with their own cosmologies that produced originary myths and systems of social and political organiza- tion do not conform to the biblical explanation. Thus, for Locke, Filmer s theory of biblical provenance of sovereignty does not apply universally. The world, Locke is aware, possesses more diverse cultures and their ways of conjuring up sources of power and social and political organization. Even the division of the world into Asia, Africa, and Europe based on Noahs sail- ing around the Mediterranean is refuted by bringing in the fourth continent, America, in order to show that, first, the biblical model is limited when applied to the principles of governance and, second, that "America then, it seems, was left to be his that could catch it" (284). Thus, it is not only that what was unknown couldn't come under the biblical scheme, but that what was left out of the biblical scheme was open for conquest. This comment on America as an absent/silent continent occurs at the end of the First Treatise in a chapter called "Who Heir?" In the Second Treatise, Locke elaborates his own theory of sovereignty based on a new definition of property whose origin is not the Bible or any other individual cosmology of old civilizations but universal rationality- and here America replaces the Bible and dominates as a site and imaginary space of theoriz- ing, a model for the exposition of a theory of property, a projection of the "old" world upon the "vacant space" of the new. Locke bases his theory of property on labor, the power of labor to transform mankind s common inher- itance into private property according to the law of nature and universal rea- son. The source of political power, says Locke, lies in the possession of private property that has in turn been made possible through the applica- tion of labor, and the arrangement to manage the conglomeration of private property among the owners would then constitute the basis of government as opposed to the divine origin of sovereignty, whose basis is the Bible and its hold on society. The theoretical foundation of liberal democracy is thus laid at the site of colonial enterprise. Work, for Locke, transforms the common inheritance of nature into pri- vate possession. Even the Indian by virtue of his labor possesses what he has obtained - "The Fruit or Venison, which nourishes the wild Indian , who</page><page sequence="14">226 • All the World was America knows no Enclosure, and is still a Tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it before it can do him any good for the support of his Life" (328). It is interesting that Locke, in his anthropomorphic Cartesian vision, makes "Earth, and all inferior crea- tures be common to all Men," and at this point the denotation of "inferior creatures" remains the nonhuman world. It is also equally interesting that in Lockes estimation, property is an entity that resides in "his own Person" (328) (as opposed to the Amerindian belief that a persons labor and belongings are part of the community to which he belongs), to which nobody has a right but himself because the " Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hand ... are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the State that Nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his Labour with, and joyned to it some- thing that is his own, and thereby makes it his Property ' (329). Labor, human labor, theoretically, philosophically, possesses the instrumental capacity that transforms the common state of nature into private property, unlike the divine entitlement that Filmer had advocated. Thus, we see that Locke pres- ents nature in tension with the ability of mankind to turn the common into private property. Lockes Law of Nature thus applies to the status of the com- mon as well as to the transformation of this common into private property. Lockes rhetoric in the chapter on property in the Second Treatise con- stantly shifts between the First Treatises overwhelming reference to the bib- lical imagery and examples, and the emerging secular interpretation of the nature of property and its justification as an interaction between human labor and natures common, whose theoretical site is Britain's colonial pos- sessions in the American continent. What also shifts is the initial emphasis on equality he assigns to the hunting and gathering activities of the Indians as property, to the later emphasis on the agrarian nature of property- "He that in Obedience to the Command of God, subdued, tilled and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it something that was his Property , which another had no Title to, nor could without injury take from him" (333). It is not only that Locke initially assigns to the fruits of hunting and gathering of the Indians the status of private property, but once that is done, as an important and integral afterthought as it were, he uses agricultural imagery to privatize and individualize the land whose protection then is</page><page sequence="15">Pramod K. Mishra • 227 suddenly required for the existence of a civilized society. Once that impera- tive emerges as a logical consequence of Locke's theory of property, the con- dition of protection of this property thus acquires a new meaning - "And hence subduing or cultivating the Earth, and having Dominion, we see are joyned together. The one gave title to the other. So that God, by command- ing to subdue, gave Authority so far to appropriate ' (334). From this rather abstract delineation of the theory of property through the invocation of nature and natures God, whose speculative site is America, it does not take long for Locke to make the condition of property as it exists in America inadequate because of its isolation from the civilized world of money and commerce. The emphasis has now shifted from the isolated instance of human labor toiling on nature to the networked and integrated human enterprise engaged in commerce. Although Locke does not explicitly elaborate it, the definition of property, too, changes with this shift in empha- sis from the isolated, disconnected effort of agriculture to the integrated, networked system of commerce whose center is enterprising Europe. In the Americas, commercial labor obviously does not predominate, but it should - the " Property of Labour should be able to over-ballance the Community of Land. For 'tis Labour indeed that puts the difference of value on everything; and let any one consider, what the difference is between an Acre of Land planted with Tobacco, or Sugar, sown with Wheat and Barley; and an Acre of the same Land lying in common, without any Husbandry upon it, and he will find, that the improvement of labour makes the far greater part of the value ' (338). Thus, in Locke the shift from fruits and game (the result of hunting and gathering) to wheat and barley (subsistence agri- culture) has come to its logical destination in such commodities as tobacco and sugar (products of the land that became quintessential goods of colo- nialism, not only because they, along with cotton, tea, indigo, and coffee, ran the economy of slavery and indentured labor, but because these commodi- ties themselves underwent transformation in the process, from their insignificant status in their original form to the most prized commodities in their colonially commercialized avatar).17 It is not only that through tobacco and sugar, the highly charged, quin- tessentially colonial products (these two cash crops have never been known</page><page sequence="16">228 • All the World was America to have represented agriculture in Europe nor subsistence agriculture any- where, and so cannot be seen separate from commerce and colonialism), Locke retains the colonial example of America in his theorizing, but that in the next paragraph he explicitly mentions "several Nations of the Americans are of this, who are rich in land, and poor in all the Comforts of Life; whom Nature having furnished as liberally as any other people, with the materials of Plenty, i.e. a fruitful Soil, apt to produce in abundance, what might serve for food, rayment, and delight; yet for want of improving it by labour, have not one hundredth, part of the Conveniences we enjoy: And a King of a large fruitful Territory there feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a day Labourer in England ' (338-39). The connotation of labor now imperceptibly changes into a commercial, and therefore colonial, enterprise. And soon this shift from one kind of labor- isolated, subsistence, and localized- to another kind of labor - commercial, colonial, and integrated into the emerging European system - no longer remains implicit. So this absence of amenities in America is not so much a matter of inad- equate labor s application to the abundance of land in America but of the absence of the commercial network. And this commercial network that Locke prizes so much in the seventeenth century is nothing but the emerg- ing capitalism that was still colonial and mercantilist in Locke's time. In the Second Treatise, Locke advances the argument of disconnectedness of the isolated fruits of labor in America whose results are that, despite the same labor producing the same goods both in America and Europe, the utilitarian (that is, exchange) value of those goods in America would not be as much as it would in Europe. In Locke's words, For I ask, what would a Man value Ten Thousand, or an Hundred Thousand Acres of excellant Land ready cultivated, and well-stocked too with Cattle, in the middle of the in-land Parts of America, where he had no hopes of Commerce with other Parts of the World, to draw Money to him by the Sale of the Product? (343) Locke has brought the internal difference between the divine rights the- ory of Filmer in which English men would be subjected to the king as the</page><page sequence="17">Pramod K. Mishra • 229 father, and his secular exposition of democracy based on private property and individual participation, to a full circle when applied to colonialism. In achieving this colonial circle, Locke, as I have shown above, goes through a set of steps. First, he successfully refutes Filmer s theory of divine rights of kings as anchored in the Christian cosmology. Then he propounds the labor theory of private property intrinsically invested in an individual s person, but by connecting the validity of premodern modes of production (hunting, gathering, and cultivating wheat and barley) to commercial enterprise anchored in European network of capitalism, Locke has finally achieved two goals: one, he has paved the way for individualism rooted in private property and democracy; and two, he has secularly justified colonialism, which was dressed before in the language of Christianity, as evident in Henry vu s let- ters patent to John Cabot. Lockes secular foundation of private property, and thus sovereignty and ultimately nationhood, far more advanced philo- sophically than Filmer s divine theory of property, is universalist in effect in comparison to the letters patent of March 5, 1497» given by Henry vu to the Venetian mariner John Cabot- both become inevitably connected to European capitalism and colonialism. Secular and religious ideas of prop- erty and governance, though different within the logic of Europe for Europeans, produce the same consequence for non-Europeans and non- Christians when applied in the colonial context. An excerpt from Henry vu s charter would make the consequence clear: Be it known that we have given and granted ... to our well beloved John Cabot, citizen of Venice [and his sons] full and free authority, leave and power to sail to all parts, countries, and seas of the East, of the West, and of the North under our banners and ensigns ... to seek out, discover and find whatsoever isles, countries, regions or provinces of the heathen and infidels whatsoever they be, and in what part of the world soever they be which before this time have been unknown to all Christians. We have granted to them . . . licence to set up our banner and ensigns in every village, town, cas- tle, isle or mainland newly found by them which they can subdue, occupy, and possess as our vassals and lieutenants, getting unto us the rule, title and jurisdiction of the same villages, towns, castles and firm land so found.18</page><page sequence="18">230 • All the World was America Henry vus legal patent to "subdue, occupy, and possess" the non- Christian village, town, castle, and mainland anywhere in the world thus may appear different from Locke's rigorous delineation of the secular foun- dation of property and sovereignty when applied to Europe, but it appears not only similar in implication when applied to alterity but supersedes plu- ralist cosmologies that he had proposed in the First Treatise in refuting Filmers biblical model. Quite reminiscent of Henry vu s letter, Locke, too, uses the language of "subduing and cultivating the Earth, and having domin- ion over" as the process of transforming nature s common into private prop- erty. This Lockean idea of private property is then quintessential^ European, ideologically designed for colonial expansion, because we have to remember here that in Locke's mind, like those of his contemporaries, the Indians in the Western hemisphere did not have any claim to private property because, for Henry vu, they were non-Christians and, for Locke, they didn't apply labor (through "subduing and cultivating the Earth" and through commerce) the same way as the Europeans had done by then. This struggle between reli- gion and secularism that has become the hallmark of European culture since the Renaissance (Renaissance, Reformation, and the Enlightenment) does not remain distinct when applied to colonial conquest. Between Henry vu s patent authorizing occupation and possession on the grounds of Christianity and Locke's secular foundation of private prop- erty and sovereignty based on labor in his Two Treatises comes an interest- ing document that Locke wrote for Anthony Ashley Cooper, later the first Earl of Shaftesbury, that has not received much notice among Locke schol- ars. This document, The Fundamental Constitution of Carolina (1669), also brings into sharp focus Locke's entire career of professional engagement with England's colonial expansion in the Americas and participation in the slave trade, and the document's relationship to Locke's theory of democracy as related to the non-European, non-Christian world. In 1668, Locke was appointed secretary to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, of which Cooper was a founding member. One of Locke's early tasks was to help write the Constitution .19 On the basis of the Constitution and an overview of Locke's professional career, I suggest that Locke's state- ment about all the world being America, and his ideas of property and</page><page sequence="19">Pr am o d K. Mishra • 231 sovereignty that he developed in the Two Treatises over the twenty years fol- lowing it, prove that the most powerful influence on Locke's evolution as a political and cultural thinker was not the events unfolding in England, as he himself explicitly suggests and most of his critics concur, but the settling of the Americas and England's involvement in the American colonies. Like the many English thinkers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, such as Edmund Burke and James and John Mill, Locke's major ideas about society arose from his close involvement in England's overseas ambitions. Until Locke joined Shaftesbury's staff as a physician, Oxford frustrated him, and afterward when a change occurred in him as a result of this asso- ciation, Oxford rejected him (Laslett, 35). But it was a chance meeting between Locke and Shaftesbury when the latter had gone to Oxford to try the waters of Astrop. The man who brought the water in flasks was not the physician but his friend Locke. This chance encounter developed into mutual admiration for reasons of Shaftesbury's power and Locke's immense knowledge, including that of medicine, which led him to operate on Shaftesbury to remove an abscess on the liver and insert a little pipe through the stomach wall as a drain to prevent another abscess from form- ing. This initial, rather chance association led to numerous joint ventures, and one of the crucial early ones was the drafting of the constitution for Carolina. Even Peter Laslett, who never otherwise elaborates Locke's colo- nial involvements, acknowledges, "We owe Two Treatises to the wonderful knowledge of state affairs which Locke acquired from frequent discourse with the first Earl of Shaftesbury. . . . Without Shaftesbury, Locke would not have been Locke at all" (39-40). Shaftesbury rose to be an important political figure in Britain, and the most vital historical phenomenon in seventeenth-century England was not so much the Puritan revolution or the Restoration or even the Glorious Revolution but England's overseas expansion, particularly in the Americas. In this colonial enterprise, immensely profitable to the aristocracy and increasingly to the rising middle classes, Locke, by his association with one of the most powerful political figures of his time, found himself all along involved not only in his investment in the Carolinas but in Africa and else- where as well. The drafting of the Fundamental Constitution of Carolina thus</page><page sequence="20">232 • All the World was America came as the crucial early apprenticeship in political thinking for Lockes full- fledged later career. In this document, Locke not only laid down hierarchi- cal rights for the Europeans (proprietors, engravers, planters, indentured labors), but put in place a whole set of different binding regulations for the Indians and the African slaves in order to "avoid erecting a numerous democracy" (175): In like manner of the twenty-four first casigques, each proprietor for himself shall nominate and chuse two, and the remaining eight shall be nominated and chosen by the Palatines court; and when the twelve first counties shall be planted, the Lords Proprietors shall again in the same manner nominate and chuse twelve more land graves, and twenty-four casigques, for the twelve next counties to be planted; that is to say, two thirds of each number by the single nomination of each proprietor for himself, and the remaining one third by the joint election of the Palatines court, and so proceed in the same manner till the whole province of Carolina set out and planted, according to the proportions in these Fundamental Constitutions (10:177-78). Provisions were made to put the proprietors' interest and power as paramount with various gradations of rights and duties for others, with slaves remaining as slaves: "The proprietors' courts shall have a power to mitigate all fines, and suspend all executions in criminal causes, either before or after sentence, in any of the other inferior courts respectively" (185). The exposition and interpretation of the colonial constitutional laws are not matters of debate and discussion, but for obedience: "Since multi- plicity of comments, as well as laws, have great inconveniences, and serve only to obscure and perplex; all manner of comments and expositions on any part of these Fundamental constitutions, or any part of the common or statute law of Carolina, are absolutely prohibited" (193). As for the slaves, their condition was improved because their soul was recognized. As a result, the slaves could be baptized but their status would remain the same: Since charity obliges us to wish well to the souls of all men, and religion ought to alter nothing in any mans civil estate or right, it shall be lawful for</page><page sequence="21">Pr am od K. Mishra • 233 slaves, as well as others, to enter themselves and be of what churge or pro- fession any of them shall think best, and therefore be as fully members as any freeman. But yet no slave shall hereby be exempted from that civil dominion his master hath over him, but be in all other things in the same state and condition he was in before Every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves, of what opinion or religion soever. (196).20 During his years of secretaryship, Locke worked with flawless compe- tence and zeal: he kept minutes of the meetings; he negotiated and conveyed grievances to the Lords; he drafted and promulgated some temporary laws on the basis of the Constitutions. In private, he kept notebooks on Carolina and oversaw Shaftesbury's voluminous papers and correspondence on colo- nial matters.21 He also maintained communication with many in the New World, especially with his friend Sir Peter Colleton, slave owner in Barbados, and drew up a bibliography of "writers of Carolina" for Colletons use. This relationship and correspondence with Colleton proved to be more than ordinary. It was mutually enriching. If Locke prepared the list of books, Colleton supplied information about the happenings in the New World, including the herbal cures for yawes and gonorrhea among slaves and advice to invest in fishing, planting, and timber.22 In 1671, at the dissolution of the old Company of Royal Adventurers to Africa, the Royal African Company arose with a new charter and new subscribers. Locke, Shaftesbury, and Colleton were among them. The investment this time was in human cargo.23 In 1672, Locke, now a "landgrave of Carolina," became a merchant adven- turer in Shaftesbury's new company of merchant adventurers for trade to the Bahamas. Locke's investment in the Royal African Company (which had a monopoly in the slave trade) was now further strengthened by his invest- ment in Shaftesbury's company of merchant adventurers (which had a monopoly of trade to large portions of America), forming involvement in the trade triangle between England, Africa, and America. In 1672, at Shaftes- bury's persuasion, Charles 11 established a Council of Trade and Foreign Plantations, with Shaftesbury as president. A year later Locke became its secretary. Through his meticulous work, Locke educated himself further</page><page sequence="22">234 • All the World was America about the details of colonial trade and plantation life. The fact that the Council was "a fact-finding, not an executive body, and its secretary was for this reason a more important man than any of the councillors" further helped in Locke's education. His knowledge, experience, and education were to prove valuable when he again served on a different colonial board in 1696. Not for nothing James Farr says, "In the case of John Lockes theory of slav- ery we find an embarrassment of riches, a tale of intimate and informed involvement with all manner of slavery" (Farr, 265). Between his two careers connected with the colonies, Locke spent an unstable life as a fugitive. He became a suspicious figure in the eyes of the Crown for his connection with Shaftesbury's "family" of Whig radicals.24 Shaftesbury had died in 1683, some four years after Locke began writing the principal draft of his Two Treatises of Government He fled to the continent shortly after 1687, having been expelled in absentia from Christ Church, Oxford, for having "belonged to the late Earl of Shaftesbury" (quoted in Farr, 268). In exile Locke resumed his writing and completed A Letter Concerning Toleration and the Essay Concerning Human Understanding Among many European intellectuals in exile were Jean Le Clerc, who advertised the argu- ments of the Essay and published Locke's first prose, and who had his own essay against slavery in his journal La Bibliothèque Universelle .25 He also met Benjamin Furly- merchant, Whig, and Quaker- who had a plan for abol- ishing slavery. Unlike Locke's earlier associations where his friends were planters and slave owners, now he was in the company of abolitionists. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Locke returned to England and published The Two Treatises anonymously. In 1696, Locke was appointed public com- missioner of the Board of Trade and became a dominant figure by virtue of his knowledge of colonial matters.26 Even in his later years, when he surren- dered his commission in 1700, he "returned to an abiding passion: tales of navigation, discovery, and exotic lands, such as Africa and the Americas" (Farr, 269). Now the questions are, How much was Locke's theory of democratic gov- ernance - rule with the consent of the governed - shaped by Locke's inti- mate knowledge of the colonies? How much was the central document of Western liberal democracy a product of transatlantic colonial transaction?</page><page sequence="23">Pramod K. Mishra • 235 And more importantly, what were the links between the Constitutions (1669) and the Two Treatises of Government (1690)? The questions are epistemo- logical. The extent to which knowledge is rooted in the materiality of ones experience, and in this case particularly in the knowledge of alterity, has become an important curiosity in the wake of the rise of postcolonial per- spective. As I have demonstrated above, there is a direct and complex link between Lockes career and the operations of the colonies, on the one hand, and his liberalism, on the other. Moreover, I have also shown how in the Second Treatise, his ideas about private property and its pivotal role in the contract between the governed and the governor, in the scheme of Natural Law, emerge out of his obsession with the Americas, a land mass that he clearly foresees as colonizable the way the rest of the "civillest" world was after the Fall. To take my argument a step further, a drastic shift occurs between Lockes privileging of pluralist cosmologies in the world (the Greeks, the Chinese, the Indians, and so on) with which he refutes Filmer s Christian cosmology as the foundation of government - and his new theory of civil government based on private property whose origin is in labor- and there- fore colonial enterprise. And this shift is Lockes successful attempt to locate his theory in the Americas and connect premodern forms of production (hunting, gathering, subsistence agriculture) to European commerce (sugar and tobacco). The grand conclusion and consequence of Locke s theory emerge as the nullification of his earlier pluralist cosmologies and the super- seding of these multiple cosmologies by his singular, universal theory of pri- vate property, government, sovereignty, and nation formation. But Locke scholars do not pursue this colonial thread and its implica- tion in the cultural understanding of both the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and what such understanding means for us in the age of global- ization. Instead, they tend to isolate Locke s Two Treatises and put them into individual boxes without their rootedness in colonial history.27 Even James Farr, while charting Lockes colonial career exhaustively by using his corre- spondence and biography, advances his thesis positivistically to exonerate Locke from the charges of inconsistency between his theory of slavery and his views on natural right, of racism and his satisfaction with his theory as</page><page sequence="24">236 • All the World was America an explanation and justification for Afro- American slavery. Farr attempts to prove that Locke's opening statement about slavery in The Two Treatises ("Slavery is so vile and miserable an estate of man and so directly opposite to the general temper and courage of our nation, that tis hardly to be con- ceived that an Englishman, much less a gentleman, should plead for it") was meant solely for Sir Filmer and his Patriarcha and what it meant for the rights of the governed in England. By calling the monarchists slavers with the weapons of "galleys, prisons, confiscations, and deaths" and Englishmen as slaves, Locke attempted to occupy the high moral ground because "slav- ery simply was not English- or at least it was not for Englishmen. 'Rule Britannia was even then the rule: Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves; Britons never never never shall be slaves'" (269). As I have shown, Farr may appear empirically right to say that "England- not Africa, not America- holds and concentrates Locke s attention," but interpretively, contrapuntally, it is not only America that becomes a source of Locke epistemology but the colonial question- the hierarchical arrangement and the nature of private property appropriated from nature, from what was called the primitive, through the application of labor, agrarian and commerce based labor- that becomes the basis of Locke's defense of sovereignty. Farr, however, is convincing in his argument that Locke's theory of slav- ery is consistent with his theory of natural rights and even necessary given his theory of just war (273). But, for Farr, Locke's just war theory violates Afro-American slavery in three ways: 1. the method of capture; 2. the demog- raphy of enslavement; and 3. the institution of hereditary bondage. On the charges of racism, Locke, for Farr, is silent. He may have been racist in a weaker sense of harboring racial prejudice, but he was not clearly a racist like most of his contemporaries. Even though he was familiar with Aphra Behn's antislavery novel Oronooko (1688), Locke never criticized Afro- American slavery. Farr argues that nothing definitive about whether Locke was racist or not could be drawn from this silence. On the other hand, racism in the stronger sense entails both moral and empirical themes: the empirical fact of black inferiority and the moral consequence of slavery based on inferiority. Locke subscribed to neither (278). Within the paradigm of empirical theory, Locke was neither a polygenist, because his worldview</page><page sequence="25">P ramo d K. Mishra • 237 functioned within the Christian cosmology, nor a degeneracy theorist, because he never conclusively said Afro-Americans were inferior. Farr s exoneration of Locke, however, finds the latter guilty of avoidance and silence on the issue of enslavement of black Africans. "He averted his eyes from the glaring contradiction between his theories and Afro-American slavery. Perhaps he fell victim of weakness of will. Given the choices available to him, Locke remained inert, frozen, speechless" (281). Thus, Farr s attempt to "divorce his [Locke's] theory of slavery from the context of Afro-American slavery, and remarry it to the English political context of 1680s" is misplaced in view of the reading methodology that has developed in the wake of the emergence of postcolonial studies. Rather than saying whether Locke's will was strong or weak when it came to Afro-American slavery, it is more pro- ductive to read Locke's career and texts, dialectically and contrapuntally, and to suggest that Locke's theory of democracy and sovereignty cannot be seen in isolation from his substantial and material connection with England's colonial affairs, particularly his education, training, and interest in drafting the Constitutions. If the composition and legalization of the Declaration of Independence represent the contradictory impulses of nationalist and cosmopolitan aspi- rations of the European settlers in North America for an ideal human com- munity based on the classical, Christian, and Enlightenment values in which the notion of nature becomes a contested epistemological category, then the omission and silences it contains, by virtue of its open-ended possibilities in philosophy and limited application in history, ground the key document of decolonizing nationalism in the double language of colonial modernity, with Europe and Europeanness (classical, Christian, and Enlightenment moder- nity) as its highest aspiration. If Locke's Two Treatises represents the embod- iment of liberal democracy in which individualism is grounded in private property through a paradoxical theory of nature and labor propounded at the colonial site of English possession in North America, then his Fundamental Constitution and his transatlantic, transcontinental political career and overseas financial investment are the hidden side of that liberal democracy.</page><page sequence="26">238 • All the World was America PART IV: NATION'S NATURE in Colonial Culture In the age of incipient nationalism and the strength of the European nation- state that, in league with capitalism, ultimately led to colonial expansion, and in the concomitant disciplinary division of knowledge, William Bartrams career and his contested work The Travels have come to represent a more complex example of the interpretation of nature and its relation to the representation of the nation. Bartrams career and work are, however, similar in many ways to the Deistic sense in which the preamble of the Declaration is couched in order to justify the struggle for the founding of a new nation, and similar to the Newtonian sense of God s common in which Locke's discourse was clothed in order to establish a rational basis for national governance. The genre of natural history emerged as a quintessen- tial discipline of the Enlightenment and colonial modernity, a discursive site that combined travel, ethnography, science, and journalism to form a nexus between the colonies and the metropolis, between the nation and its transnational, transcultural forces. In Michel Foucault s words, From the second half of the seventeenth century, natural history had set out to analyze and classify natural beings according to their visible characters. All this "treasure" of knowledge that antiquity and the Middle Ages had accumulated- and which concerned the virtues of plants, the powers of ani- mals, secret correspondences and sympathies - since Ray, all this had become marginal knowledge for naturalists. What remained to be discov- ered, however, were "structures," that is, forms, spatial arrangements, the number and size of elements: natural history took upon itself the task of mapping them, of transcribing them in discourse, of preserving, confronting, and combining them, in order to make it possible, on the one hand, to deter- mine the vicinities and kinships of living beings (and therefore the unity of creation) and, on the other, to recognize rapidly any individual (and there- fore his unique place in creation).28</page><page sequence="27">Pram o d K. Mishra • 239 With the emergence of Enlightenment rationality, this work of preparing the taxonomy of the visible characters of flora and fauna fell upon the gaze of one who had acquired the capacity to know by participating in the net- work of knowledge production; this infrastructure, which was European, had endowed his gaze with sovereign powers. In the face of the sovereignty of the gaze, "the virtue of plants, the powers of animals, secret correspon- dences and sympathies"- in short, the organic cultural values of things- became marginal. The naturalist s gaze now became, through the rise of empiricism (a mode of knowing to which Locke had much to contribute), empowered to "see, to isolate features, to recognize those that are identical and those that are different, to regroup them, to classify them by species or families" (Foucault, Birth of the Clinic, 89). From these universalist taxo- nomie categories to that of the nation is the story of nationalism, colonial- ism, and capitalism. This interconnection between the nation, private property, and natural history does not mean that these categories approached nature with the same spade, so to speak. Whereas in Jefferson's invocation to nature and natures God, and in Locke's nature as God's com- mon-amenable to conversion to private property and individual freedom through individual labor- nature and God were abstractions, in Bartram nature becomes the flora and fauna, the concrete object for the taxonomie gaze of natural history discourse initiated by Carl Linnaeus. Because the sev- enteenth and eighteenth centuries are a crucial time for the emergence of nationalism, and with it the various disciplinary divisions in the human sci- ences,29 Bartram's Travels (1791), like Locke's works, inhabits a limilinal dis- ciplinary space, even though it was received in its time as a work of natural history and criticized for its hybridity. No wonder, then, that The Travels has been designated as part anthropology, part scientific treatise, part litera- ture - in short, an interdisciplinary work of hybrid genres produced on the cusp of colonialism and nation-state formation, in the period of the mixing and mingling of the former and the ideology of the purity of the latter. But much of this subsequent appreciation of Bartram's work came later, partly because of the transatlantic appropriation of The Travels as an example of incipient Romanticism by figures like Wordsworth and Coleridge, and partly</page><page sequence="28">240 • All the World was America because of its appropriation by the emerging ideology of the U.S. nation- state as the exuberant expression of the emerging nation with all its para- phernalia of flags, borders, symbols, discourses, disciplines, inventions. The Travels of William Bartram has been called "the most astounding verbal artifact of the early republic" by William Hedges in his essay "Toward a National Literature" in The Columbia Literary History of the United States .30 Like the Declaration of Independence, Bartrams Travels has been inter- preted, thus, as the symbolic creation of the emerging nations enthusiastic and exuberant spirit. Thus, Douglas Anderson compares Bartrams Travels with such quintessential assertions of American nationalism as Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, which was written mainly as "an act of revo- lutionary self-defense against the invidious, Eurocentric naturalism of the Comte de Buffon and the loyalist opposition to American independence within the colonies themselves" (4); and as J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer , which "addresses the violence and dis- ruption of the revolution" (4).31 But the most astounding aspect of this arti- fact of the U.S. national literature, however, is that it does not contain even a single reference to the War of American Independence, the quintessential revolution not only in the history of decolonization but also of the birth of the United States as the first modern nation-state, a first postcolonial event that would prove the precursor of later nation-states in Latin America in the nineteenth century and the rest of the Third World in the twentieth cen- tury.32 This complete shutting out of the Revolution from the text of the Travels , despite the fact that Bartram undertook his travels during the cru- cial years between 1773 and 1777 and that he composed his book from his notes in the 1780s and published it in 1791, is indeed more than a mere coin- cidence. Even those scholars who mention this silence and set out to explore its contours and make it the central issue of their analysis attribute it to a number of sources: to the objectivity of Bartrams scientific temperament, to his pacifist Quaker background, or to a combination of both. Anderson, for example, emphasizes the scientific aspect of Bartrams endeavors. "Instead of political engagement, Bartram offers the reader long paragraphs com- posed of the Linnaean names for the plants he finds covering the savannahs of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. In dramatic contrast to Crevecoeur s</page><page sequence="29">Pr am o d K. Mishra • 241 interest in human beings and human institutions, or to Jefferson's sharply partisan sentiments, Bartram apparently turns his attention, with equal sin- glemindedness, to birds, fish, trees, or soil" (5). Acknowledging Bartram's seriousness about his botany and the piety that nature nourished in him, Anderson states that Bartram also "recognized the value of his vocation, even in its apparent detachment from social turmoil, as a political gesture and as a pretext for addressing the painful problems of nation building. The profession of science here is harnessed to the august task of building the nation. Scientific detachment itself is a posture as well as a professional attribute" (5). Invoking Richard Poiriers observation that "most interesting American books are an image of the creation of America itself" (6), Anderson interprets the wars, ruins, and apocalyptic storms in Bartram's book as his "personal attempt to make the dangers of national life clear to his contemporaries" (8), thus underscoring "his sense of the ethical and spir- itual uncertainties of American life" (9). Others set out to play the tracing game by proving how and whom among the Royalists and patriots Bartram met and interacted with during his travels through the South of the United States.33 Because we know that the claim of science to be objective is an ide- ological exercise and thus unreliable if not false, and that Bartram does not hesitate to stage and dramatize the fierce, violent side of nature and pro- nounce rather harsh judgment upon both European and Amerindian civi- lizations in his travel accounts, thus affording the reader numerous moments of subjective plenitude, we have to look for explanation else- where-namely, Bartram's imbrication as a naturalist in the transatlantic colonial network of power, knowledge, and commerce. But this construction and narration of the national self with the rhetor- ical deployment of nature and its landscape had been an established theme in modern Europe since the sixteenth century. Indeed, nature, along with lit- erature, language, and culture, had come to constitute one of the dominant tropes of the national soul. Works on the pastoral beauty of the Lake district by Wordsworth and Coleridge, and the landscape painting of Palmer, Turner, and Constable sought to celebrate the pride in this "green and pleasant land."34 As a symbiotic and composite, if conflicting, incarnation of the rep- resentation of Europe from the classical to Christian to the Enlightenment</page><page sequence="30">242 • All the World was America periods, the discourses of nation building found nature as a defining category for its distinct self-expression. Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia, origi- nally published in 1781, by refuting the denigration of Buffon and privileging the nature of the new republic, appropriates nature as the expression of the new republic s originality. It is, then, no wonder that Bartrams Travels has been appropriated by the critics to serve the nationalist goal. But nature, at the cusp of the emergence of the modern nation, was also a key site for the production of the discourse of enlightenment - and consequently, to use Mary Louise Pratt s phrase, the planetary consciousness of imperial design.35 Indeed, nature in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries emerged as a site over which national and imperial ambitions could be asserted and played out. The idea of nature was "the governing idea of the age of the Enlightenment."36 With the emergence of postcolonial criticism as a new way of looking at cultural production and reception, interest has arisen to place Bartrams work in Europe's imperialist design as embodied in Enlightenment rational- ism. Thus, John Seelye as early as 1981 evaluated Bartrams Travels in light of other works of natural history as part of Europe's attempt to impose its uni- versalist taxonomy on the rest of the world and to bring the world under its colonial orbit. In the case of his father, John Bartram, it is an easy task to pin him as an imperialist because of his explicit association with imperialist ide- ology and hatred for the Indians. Florida and other parts of the South for him were just other places to gather his plant samples and information. In 1743, he set out to travel through Florida and kept a record of his journey, as his son would do thirty years later. Taken in company with Lewis Evans, John Bartrams trip to the sources of the Susqehanna was, in Seelyes words, "an epochal event, a prelude of several sorts to the epical collision of geopoliti- cal forces soon to take place" (40).37 Out of this trip, Evans gathered the data for his great map of 1749, which was to be made even better in 1755. But Bartrams observations concerning "curious plants, shrubs, and trees" in his notebook are no less fraught with imperialist implications when compared with his other remarks about the sites for future settlements and his deni- grating comments about the Indians. Seelye compares John Bartrams jour- ney, therefore, with journeys of Captain John Smith and George Washington. In Seelyes words,</page><page sequence="31">P ramo d K. Mishra • 243 Given an epic e'lan by the gathering tensions of impending war, John Bartram's 1743 journey is a logical extension of earlier travels of colonial exploration, and may be seen as a continuation of Captain John Smiths voy- age as far as the falls of the Susquehanna in 1608. As such, it is counterpart to George Washington's trans-Allegheny trip in 1753, which was another diplomatic mission in the interests of securing Anglo-American empire. All three were imperial journeys, undertaken by men acting under instructions from colonial powers, and, most important, all three were harbinger of civi- lized order, whether in the shape of exploration bringing settlement in its wake or as scientific discovery for the benefit of mankind (40). Furthermore, John Bartram's Florida journal was published with William Storck's Description of East-Florida in 1766, a work that had been published earlier the same year with the express purpose, in Seelyes words, "to encour- age the settlement and economic exploitation of the region recently ceded to Great Britain by Spain, part of the massive geopolitical realignment of North American territories occasioned by the Treaty of Paris in 1763" (41). In the introduction to his book, Storck was quite explicit about his imperialist plans. He wrote, "The importance of East-Florida, in a national view depends upon two grounds: first, its fertility in producing such articles of commerce as will be beneficial to Great Britain; secondly, upon its convenience, from its situa- tion and other circumstances, to carry on a beneficial commerce with the Spanish settlements in time of peace; and to intercept the trade, and cut off their communication with Europe in time of war" (ii). Like an expert imperi- alist adventurer, Storck, "in estimating the value of East-Florida . . . accounted upon what it will be when settled, rather than upon what it now is" (vii).38 Both John Bartram and Storck valued, like Locke, not what Florida was worth when labor turned nature into private property (according to this scheme even the Indians were capable of private property), but the potential for the future when it was brought under commercial and so imperial network. Locke's the- orization of private property carved out of God's common by labor and com- merce in his Two Treatises in relation to Britain's colonial territory in North America as discussed above was finally being put into concrete terms about three quarters of a century later by Storck and John Bartram.</page><page sequence="32">244 • All the World was America In his introduction to John Bartrams journal, Storck praised him as "an able Naturalist," whose reputation in the learned world, meaning Europe, was attested to by his recently becoming "Botanist to his Majesty for both the Floridas" He further said that the "usefulness of his journal in making early known to the world what are the natural productions of the country to which it relates, is a sufficient proof of the usefulness of his appointment" (i). Storcks comment about the elder Bartram is pertinent with respect to the publication of the latter s journal in the former s volume, for it shows the transregional, transatlantic global transfer and circulation of articles of commerce and discourse about them, obviously for the benefit of the impe- rial power and the colonialists. The search for knowledge, the incessant curiosity, and the active spirit became allies of imperial enterprise in which the Enlightenment ideal united with colonial exploitation to become the equivalent of the late-sixteenth-century missionary impulse that heralded Englands entry into the imperial game, an illustration of which I have given earlier in this essay by citing Henry vu s letter of patent to John Cabot.39 But William Bartrams career was different from his father s in more ways than one, including their generational difference and their approach to nature and to Indians. In Seelyes words, "Father and son were virtual per- sonifications of the developing Enlightenment spirit in America, at one end a persistent but pedestrian gathering of information, at the other a sunburst of rising glory merging with the nimbus of revolutionary romanticism" (39). If John Bartram was famous and successful (founding member of the Philosophical Society of America, George Ills Royal Botanist in Britain's North American colonies, in Carl Linnaeuss words "the most famous natu- ralist" in the world), William Bartram was a failure, lacked the burning ambition of his father, failed at almost all the trades- day laborer, plantation owner in Florida, storekeeper in North Carolina, printer and engraver in Philadelphia. And even the one profession in which he excelled - drawing flora and fauna for his patrons in England and gathering plants, flowers, and seeds - the "Puc Puggy" (flower hunter) of the Indians - he stopped alto- gether after his return to Philadelphia in 1777 from his travels to Britain's Southern colonies and Indian territories. If for John Bartram nature was a "storehouse of useful commodities created by a beneficent Deity for men,"</page><page sequence="33">Pr am o d K. Mishra • 245 for William the natural world was "irradiated with an almost mystical aura, a divine light that gave a religious meaning to Linnaeuss order" (Seelye, 39). Billy Bartram's was in many respects the sharp contrast to the utilitarian, scientific temperament of European Enlightenment. To quote Seelye further, "His writings were criticized upon publication for containing less science than poetry, but they were praised later on for their imaginative qualities by Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Carlyle" (39). Seelye calls him an American Blake for his private and eccentric vision and reclusive muse, and in this respect he does not resemble his contemporaries who traveled through Europe's colonies. That's why Seelye calls William Bartram's project not a "national but a highly individualistic exercise, personal and subjective errand into the wilderness" (41). Not for nothing, therefore, while George Washington was called "town-eater," Bartram was called "flower-hunter" by the Indians. Bartram's attitude was not just Rousseauistic appreciation of the noble savage but genuine, fierce, unlike his Deist father's. The difference between father and son, for Seelye, was that between Enlightenment ration- ality and budding Romanticism. But unlike the author of the Declaration and Locke, Bartram was neither prolific nor widely recognized and celebrated in his own time, even though the Travels received widespread recognition by the likes of Coleridge and Wordsworth. In fact, Billy Bartram as a person was a total failure, as I have mentioned above, both in his early and later life. His early failure in finding a successful calling and lack of ambition became a constant source of anxi- ety for his transatlantically successful father, John Bartram, George ins Royal Botanist for Britain's North American colonies, who was, among other things, a transatlantic interlocutor, through correspondence, with Carl Linnaeus, and founding member of the American Philosophical Society with Ben Franklin. If William Bartram's early failures at practical professions- day labor, engraver, trader, farmer - suggest that his artistic and intellectual temperament was somewhat reluctant to apply Lockean labor to God's com- mon to own private possessions (at the time of his death in 1823, he owned few personal possessions), his later lack of will to aspire to fame and recog- nition either in the new republic or in Europe reveals the double bind of the discourse of nationalism and colonialism in which he found himself trapped.</page><page sequence="34">246 # All the World was America Once the book was published in 1791, after fourteen years of his travels through the southern parts of the United States, and was received well both within the United States and England, William Bartram could not be like his father- could not pursue relentlessly his vocation of naturalist through the length and width of the new republic for recognition both at home and abroad. He just could not pursue new travels or undertake the natural his- tory projects for which he had demonstrated such prolific capability. Even after finally finding a calling, Bartrams failure to launch a career instead of vegetating on his brother s farm for almost thirty years is something that has not been explored fully. Even when critics suggest a cause for this remarkable lack of will, they attribute it to his personal inclination and broken foot, which is another way of evading the historical question of shifting geopolitics. For one thing, from Bartrams concerns for the plight of the Indians in the South, his exuberant interest in the description and drawing of natural objects, both in scientific and literary terms, his habit of travel- all these suggest that there was more than just his personal nature and broken foot that caused the remarkable lack of will to pursue this newfound calling in the new republic. In order to get a comprehensive picture of Bartrams double silence (the silence about the Revolution in The Travels and his later silence after its publication), we need to go beyond the simple dichotomies between Enlight- enment rationality and Romanticism, or nationalism and colonialism, as Bartrams critics have done. We need to understand Bartrams career in the context of the geopolitical transformation in the transatlantic world of the time and put Bartrams professional and personal endeavors in light of the negotiation between the personal and the professional, the national and the colonial. Personally, there is no doubt that Bartram was committed to the cause of the Indians and consequently saw the indigenous civilization as complex and ancient. His urgency in humanizing the Indians also stemmed from his awareness of the imminent destruction that awaited them. The most obvi- ous evidence of this commitment to seeing the indigenous peoples in all their sophistication is displayed in the very title of the book itself- Travels Through North &amp; South Carolina, Georgia , East &amp; West Florida , the Cherokee</page><page sequence="35">Pr am o d K. Mishra • 247 Country ; the Extensive Territories of the Muscogulges, or Creek Confederacy, and the Country of the Choctaws; Containing an Account of the Soil and Natural Productions of Those Regions , Together with Observations on the Manners of the Indians (1719). To be sure, the title is cumbersome by today s standards but it does not seek to simplify the complexity either of the colo- nial settlement or the internal distinctions among the indigenous peoples otherwise lumped together under the misnomer "Indians" by the universal- ist taxonomy of the colonial powers. A look at the original title makes it clear that it divides the territories of Bartrams travel into two sections: the colo- nial territories captured and instituted by Britain and the Indian territories known by the names of the tribes that inhabit them. This eye for and recep- tivity to the complexity and antiquity of the indigenous culture is further evidenced when Bartram imputes a multilayered, multifaceted dimension to the Indian past. At one point, Bartram describes the architectural sophisti- cation of the Cherokee townhouse, which was capable of accommodating several hundred people. This large rotunda stands, to quote Bartram, "on top of an ancient artificial mount of earth, of about twenty feet perpendicular, and the rotunda on the top of it being above thirty feet more, gives the whole fabric an elevation of about sixty feet from the common surface of the ground" (297).40 Testimony to the sophisticated, systematic, and civilized conduct of the Indians abounds in Bartram. After an account of an Indian council meeting in which the Indians arrived at their systematic decision to put to death one of three Spanish captives - the governor s son - on the prin- ciple of equality and fairness, Bartram declares, "As moral men they certainly stand in no need of European civilization" (385). Since Henry vus charter to John Cabot, the English had used the rhetoric of Christianizing and civiliz- ing the non-Christians and non-Europeans to colonize them, but here Bartram clearly and unambiguously rejects the prime rhetoric of coloniza- tion and finds them self-sufficient in morality and civilization. Furthermore, They are just, honest, liberal and hospitable to strangers; considerate, loving and affectionate to their wives and relations; fond of their children; indus- trious, frugal, temperate and persevering; charitable and forbearing. I have been weeks and months amongst them and in their towns, and never</page><page sequence="36">248 # All the World was America observed the least sign of contention or wrangling: never saw an instance of an Indian beating his wife, or even reproving her in anger. In this case they stand as examples of reproof to the most civilized nations, as not being defective in justice, gratitude, and a good understanding (385). Thus Bartram, unlike his imperialist father, goes on detailing the com- plexity and antiquity of the Indians in such chapter titles in part IV of his book as "Description of the Character, Customs and Persons of the American Aborigines, from my own Observations, as well as from the general and impartial Report of Ancient Respectable Men, either of their own People, or White Traders, who have Spent many Days of their Lives among them," "On their Government and Civil Society," "Of their Dress, Feasts, and Divertise- ments," "Concerning Property, Agriculture, Arts and Manufacture," and "Of their Marriage and Funeral Ceremonies." Whats more, Bartram sprinkles his book with rebuke to the European settlers: "It is astonishing, though a fact, as well as a sharp reproof to the white people, if they will allow themselves liberty to reflect and form a just estimate, and I must own elevates these people to the first rank among mankind, that they have been able to resist the continual efforts of the complicated host of vices, that have for ages over-run the nations of the old world, and so contaminated their morals; yet more so, since such vast armies of these evil spirits have invaded this conti- nent, and closely invested them on all sides" (386). In all these titles and reproofs, there is a tone of urgency, appeal, and tes- timonial authenticity for an understanding of indigenous culture and hence equal respect for those who have produced and possess this culture. There is also an underlying premonition of greater forces at work that would soon be inevitably destructive to the Indian civilization. And despite his personal commitment and good will, Bartram clearly saw what was to come. Both the nation and the colonial power were ways of accomplishing one goal: turning God s common into private property and connecting it to the colonial enter- prise. That is why Bartram expresses astonishment and offers a critique of double-edged Lockean philosophy, "How are we to account for their excel- lent policy in civil government; it cannot derive its influence from coercive laws, for they have no such artificial system" (387)-</page><page sequence="37">Pramod K. Mishra • 249 But as the nationalist imaginary and discourses take hold with the emer- gence of the new republic, the books title also undergoes simplification and shrinkage. Later editions of the book truncate the title either to The Travels of William Bartram or end it after Florida with ellipses, repressing and silenc- ing the complex past of the sophisticated and individually distinct Indian cultures and territories. A kind of reification and simplification occurs when territories and fluid cultural boundaries are transformed into the modernist logic of the nation-state that demarcates in order to dominate nature by turning it into private possession and then affixing rigid borders around it. Both the nation and the colonial power in this sense function within the same logic of modernity. This homogenizing and subsuming tendency of the anticolonial nationalist state has received much attention in postcolonial discourse, particularly in the Indian critic Partha Chatterjees influential books: Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World : A Derivative Discourse? (1986) and The Nation and Its Fragments: Colonial and Postcolonial Histories (1995). Case studies of the Indian situation, these works investigate and expose the tendency and necessity of an anticolonial movement, and later of the state, to invent a nationalist myth of homogeneity so that it could both unite the colonial powers and, after political decolonization, raise the edifice of the state on the rhetoric and figuration of a homogenous community. The nation and the colonial powers in this sense are not very different from each other, especially in the American case, because both were based on the same principle of private property connected not only to individual labor, intrin- sically able to transform nature into private possession, but to the transac- tion of that possession, through commerce, into exchangeable property in the capitalist regime, a notion that Locke propounded about America. If, as critics have imputed to him, Bartram had little interest in partici- pating in this kind of nation building, he knew he could not build his career on the transatlantic colonial model, which was not very desirable either. For in the logic of colonialism, knowledge, Foucault has told us, is a direct ally of power. Once the British colonial interests folded up from their North American colonies, interest in the nature of the colonies also ceased. It shifted to the emerging colonies of the South Pacific with Captain Cooks voyages in that region. It is thus clear that interest in exploration is inextricably tied to</page><page sequence="38">250 • All the World was America the desire to possess that which is explored. Furthermore, that which is pos- sessed is legitimized through a discourse of scientific study and education. And one of the ways the explored could be both legitimately possessed and ostensibly displayed without facing the opprobrium of plunder is through legitimate, scientific, and publicly praiseworthy collection practices. Natural history in this regard, among its other goals, turned into one of the coveted instruments of European imperialism. It is thus clear that the business of natural history and collection prac- tices were imbricated in the colonial and commercial enterprises. The history of modern museums and European collection practices dates back to the six- teenth century,41 precisely the time when European interests in the non- European world assumed the form of exploration for the purposes of colonization. We have seen how natural history- collecting, naming, classi- fying, displaying, studying, bringing the world under the sovereignty of the taxonomizing European gaze - was involved as an indispensable practice of European imperialism. So, the network of communities within which the knowledge of natural history was made possible existed in Europe, and colo- nial interest of the European state, in this case England, also was European. John Bartrams famous career had been made possible primarily because of the existence of this European infrastructure. He was not only rated by Carl Linnaeus as "the greatest natural botanist of the world" and made an hon- orary member of the Royal Academy of Science of Sweden but was also made George iii s royal botanist to North America. For all his career that began as a humble Pennsylvania farmer, he corresponded with such notable Europeans as Linnaeus, the great collector Sir Hans Sloane, Dr. John Fothergill, Dr. Lettsom, Peter Collinson, and others, leading figures in the European circles of collection practices. Among these Collinson remained a lifelong sponsor of the senior Bartrams expeditions and encouraged Billy Bartrams interests in the calling. Through him John Bartram sent detailed descriptions of nature to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.42 After Collinsons death, Fothergill became William Bartrams patron, a fact with which he begins the very first chapter of his book, "At the request of Dr. Fothergill, of London, to search the Floridas, and western parts of Carolina and Georgia, for the discovery of rare and useful productions of nature ... in</page><page sequence="39">Pramod K. Mishra • 251 April 1773, I embarked for Charleston" (23). As Fothergill s reputation was built on the transatlantic colonial network, his motives were not just philan- thropic nor those of a pure nature lover s like William Bartrams. "No eccen- tric plant collector, Dr. Fothergill was a hard-headed businessman and highly respected member of the international scientific community."43 If the community of collectors provided a world of funding, assessment, competition, and circulation of discourses, the official Societies (and these were many and could be called the inevitable by-product of the colonial enterprise) provided the official and institutional sites for the recognition and celebration of knowledge about and acquisition of specimens from the colonies. These official and private venues formed an interlinked network of science, aesthetics, and commerce. Natural history auctions first took place on the Continent in the late seventeenth century and in England in the eigh- teenth century. In all, nearly 1,600 auctions are known to have been con- ducted in Great Britain, creating a market among the curators of museums and private collectors.44 So, the fetishistic interest in collecting the posses- sions of the colonies had always had behind it the commercial interest. Thus, England's infrastructure tied a naturalists endeavors not only to the "inter- national scientific community," by which was meant the European scientific community, but also, with the goal of science to do business, to the cause of capitalism, which had at the time manifested itself as European imperialism. In the immediate aftermath of the founding of the new republic, then, this double impediment prohibited William Bartrams further venture into the world of natural history. On the one hand, his fear of the new nations innate capacity to harm the Indians, and, on the other, Europe's lack of inter- est in North American colonies and withdrawal of patronage of its infra- structure for natural history, combined to stifle William Bartrams interest in exploration and further travels through the territories of the land. His career occurred at the cusp of the transition between colonialism and nationalism and folded as a result of this overwhelming tension. Indeed, Bartram rejected in the end both the nationalist and the imperialist choices. And the potential third choice, in which the Europeans would live on the principles of coexistence and equality with the indigenous population, was simply not available in this binary logic of nationalism and colonialism.</page><page sequence="40">252 • All the World was America Now we can see that Gish Jens bewilderment ("How is it, though, that we all rise and fall with the tide of countries we may never have seen?") does not come out of nowhere. It stems from the conflicting ideology of the nation- state formation that contains within it an inherent contradiction between aspiration for sublime, cosmopolitan philosophical values and immediate material interests rooted in private possession and its commercial value. The deployment of a postcolonial perspective enables us here both to cri- tique and appropriate the ideologies of colonialism and nationalism, in order to redefine and restructure our view of the world geopolitically and geoculturally so that a new formation of cultural internationalism might emerge. My deliberate use of Gish Jen to frame the discussion of the Declaration of Independence, John Locke, and William Bartram has been motivated by the ideological incentive of postcolonial perspective, in which the interrogation of the past occurs from the perspective of the colonial experience of the present in order to deploy that past hermeneutically for a more participatory cultural formation of the present and the future. In this sense, postcolonial perspective attempts to interrogate the historical logic of nationalism as much as that of the confined and confining domains of dis- ciplines, periods, and genres, categories that were born as a result of the structural imperatives of modernity and nation-state formation in the West. I have shown catachrestically, to use Gayatri Spivak's term for interpreting strategically, or contrapuntally, to use Edward Said s word for excavating and interpreting the silences of the past, that there was no such thing as the United States over two hundred years ago. But to say that is to state the obvi- ous. What I have also suggested is that the fluid, transatlantic world that existed in the colonial period has now reemerged with a new geopolitical dynamic and imperative in the form of globalization, in which peoples, tech- nology, ideas, cultures are in flux. The nationalist rigidity and reification that has lasted since the late eighteenth century as a political, cultural, economic, and discursive reference point is no longer either possible or desirable. I am also suggesting that the United States cannot be theorized any more as a self-contained entity solely in terms of ethnicity and civil rights; these have to be inevitably conducted in conjunction with global rights of human beings everywhere, particularly in the so-called Third World.</page><page sequence="41">Pr am o d K.

But all these declarations by different groups have been made in the spirit of Gish Jens bewilderment I mentioned earlier- indeed, all these declarations have aimed to obtain equal rights of citizenship and privileges within the framework of the nation-state called the United States. Laudable as these declarations and their achievements have been in demanding equality within a nation- state, these have been part of the incomplete project of modernity, because all these declarations have valorized the nation-state as the ultimate reference point. 5.

My usage theoretically implicates the category of the nation-state in at least three ways. One is the obvious historical reality of its con- structedness through discourses (legal, political, literary), imagination, and structures. Two, the policing of the national and racial boundaries and the keeping out of the for- eign, the alien, the inferior in order to keep the nation and race pure. About racial taint- edness, much work has been done with reference to Jefferson's own attempt to keep out</page><page sequence="42">254 • All the World was America one side of his (African American) heritage. The taintedness of the nation as a policed boundary can be seen in the role of smuggling or porousness of borders, for example, between the British colonies in North America and the Spanish Empire. In fact, there is enough documented historical evidence to suggest that the formation of the United States as a nation-state, particularly the crucial event of the outbreak of the War of Independence, was caused as much by the noble nationalist sentiments and needs of the patriots as by the smuggling that went on from the Spanish colonies into the English colonies in North America, where the English planters of the Caribbean wanted to have a monopoly of their locally produced goods to be sold at a higher price. To obtain this monopoly, more than once they fought in the British Parliament for trading privileges. The consequent restriction imposed by Britain on trade between its North American colonies and the Spanish colonies eventually led to more astringent meas- ures and to war. This is the underside of the noble sentiments of nation formation. Theoretically, it could be argued that the foundation of a national boundary or identity depends on this ever open space for smuggling, the darker side of the noble national- ist sentiments of bravery, valor, pride, honor, sanctity, and so on. For trade and smug- gling in the region, among many others, see William S. McClellan, Smuggling in American Colonies at the Outbreak of the American Revolution (New York, 1912). In this essay, however, I touch on only the third way in which the national imagi- nary has been tainted. And this is its historical rootedness in coloniality. 11.

There are two main types of scholarly inter- est in Locke's American connection. One, those who try to determine the extent of influence of Locke's ideas in the construction of the United States, particularly in the eighteenth century, but also in shaping the ideas of the elite in the seventeenth century. For an extensive study of Locke's background as it relates to America, see Jerome Huyler, Locke in America : The Moral Philosophy of the Founding Era (University Press of Kansas, 1995). Second, there are those who have investigated the presence of America in Locke's works, particularly his Two Treatises. The number here is small, as mentioned above. See Herman Lebovics, "The Uses of America in Locke's Second Treatise of Government," Journal of History of Ideas 47 (1986): 567-81. Lebovics s essay does examine the presence of America well, but more in relation to the American Indians inhabiting the empty land and what that means for Locke's theory of property. I bring to bear on Locke's Two Treatises the tools of literary analysis, and my textual interpretation of both Locke's treatises in relation to each other, as well as to Locke's earlier and later career, is informed by the postcolonial perspective; it raises the broader question of capitalism's connection to coloniality in the transatlantic framework in order to undermine the epistemology of the nation, whether it is England or the United States. 28.

For a summary of the criticism and a defense of Buell, see Peter Hulme, "Including America," Ariel 26, no. 1 (1995): 117-23. Hulme's support for Buell stems from his desire to understand the processes that led the United States from its postcolonial status of subservience to Europe to an imperial power in its own rights. Yet this is precisely what I am doing here. My purpose in calling that founding moment "postcolonial," however, does not quite resemble Buell s because I am not interested only in comparing the status of U.S. cultures alterity vis-à-vis European culture in its nationalist moment in the nineteenth century as Buell does, but rather in bringing together the liminal moments of decolonization and nation-state formation with that of globalization. And that includes accounting for the rise of the United States as an imperial formation in its own right, and what that means for postcolonial studies. In my view, to speak of postcoloniality only in terms of European colonialism, though useful, is like an obsessive beating of a dying horse. I'm trying to bring together European as well as American colonial and imperial moments and impulses. 33. See particularly Edward J.

For the role of Christianity and the Spanish empire in the first phase of colonization, see Walter Mignolo, Local History/Global Designs. Mignolo calls this period of European expansion (from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries up to the emer- gence of the Enlightenment discourse in the eighteenth century) colonialism with the goal of Christianizing the heathens, and the period after that imperialism with the sec- ular discourse of civilizing the savages. 40.
