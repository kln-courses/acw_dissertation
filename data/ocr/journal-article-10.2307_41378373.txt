<plain_text><page sequence="1">In 2006 an exhibition of pictures by the Dutch artist Jacob van Ruisdael (1628-1682) was held at the SacklerWingof the Royal Academy of Arts.1 Displayed trophy-like at the entrance to the third room was a chalk and pencil drawing of the inte- rior of the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam purported to be by Ruisdael. Even to the uninitiated the drawing seemed uncharacteristic of the artist, and more than just for the fact that, as the exhi- bition's title proclaimed, Ruisdael is feted as the 'Master of Landscape'. While he did on occasion venture into city subjects, this ecclesiastical interior is almost unprecedented.2 The subject of the drawing, the ancient Old Church (stand- ing in the centre of a district dominated by Amsterdam's oldest profession) is not only to be seen, but its wondrously anonymous space is also to be felt - a synthesis of the senses more typically used to describe Ruisdael's rugged landscapes, which in itself could be a plausible explanation for the drawing's attribution to him.3 Given Ruisdael's specialism, there is a case to make that this drawing instinctively fused emerging ideas based on the study of nature with ancient explanations of physiological phe- nomena (and the tradition of depicting interior, architectural space as akin to a human, bodily nature). This fusing of naturalistic tropes, how- ever, remains purely speculative. What we do know is that the exhibition's curator, renowned Ruisdael expert Seymour Slive, first tested the waters as to the drawing's attribution by placing it deep within his 2001 catalogue raisonné of the artist. When this met with no objection ( raisonné or otherwise), he followed with the more brazen provocation of hanging it at the Royal Academy - as clear a call to arms as historians, art or other- wise, will ever get. In the three years since there has been no reply. This deafening silence may well have some- thing to do with the fact that the drawing occu- pies a narrow field in Dutch art history, whose parochialism seems divided only by the distinc- tion between the lavish and mostly imaginary late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century church interiors of the southern Low Countries (the 'Antwerp School') and the stark, often skewed, early to mid-seventeenth-century 'Protestant-driven' perspectives of the north (the 'Delft-type'). Ruisdael, or whoever is the true signatory of this drawing, significantly, though in all likelihood unintentionally, merges this distinction, reorientating the northern Dutch church as an animate subject. In the process he rekindles art and architecture's relationship with the body in a way that builds on the Renaissance notion (as Anthony Vidier would have it) that the 'building is a body of some kind', foreshadowing eighteenth-century ideas that the 'building embodies states of mind based on bodily sensation'.4 Of course, this is only a single picture, accessioned in 1925 as a work by Pieter Jansz 70 Nave(l) Gazing Christopher Pierce Saenredam (1597-1665), despite the somewhat murky Ruisdael signature at its base, and then immured in the stale grandeur of the École des Beaux- Arts, the 'sheltered enclave' of the classi- cal body.5 If we look at the drawing in its cultural context, abandoning the resolutely biographical and formal criteria of Dutch art history, we can see that where certain artists (most notably Saenredam) associate the proliferating science of projective geometry and pictorial representa- tion with ongoingpolitical, social and religious reform, the Oude Kerk' s draughtsman's manner is more corporeal, tying the picture to another vital aspect of seventeenth-century Dutch sci- ence and culture - its anatomical and physiolog- ical concerns. In this sense it represents a separate perspective on contemporary socio- political affairs. But the new spatial world that it establishes is bent on unravelling an interior rather than constructing an exterior. More specifically, the body that it describes is the med- ical body, reconstructed by each new theory of health; its physiological antecedents include the Roman philosopher Galen of Pergamům (131- 201) and the Flemish physician Jakob Börding (1511-1560), while its anatomical sources are early modern representations of the chambers of the heart, stomach and uterus.6 These two distinct artistic and ideological positions, how- ever incongruous, reinforce the fact that the his- tory of architecture and its representation is a history of the body. Although where architec- ture's body is typically placeless, in this case it is site-specific. It is no coincidence that this visual and ideological scuffle is played out in the Reformation's defining and still fertile site - the church. Predating Saenredam and Ruisdael, of course, and older still than the Old Church, the body and building relationship has domi- nated architecture theory since Vitruvius first inscribed man in the middle of everything in Book Three of DeArchitectura. The pervasive- ness of this architectural Ptolemy survived almost unchallenged up to the middle of the eighteenth century, when the French Jesuit priest Abbé Marc-Antoine Laugier (1711-1769) famously, in the 'Primitive Huť, switched things around and placed the building before the man. Since then, the body and building have endured a fractious union. Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439-1501) and his Renaissance com- patriots, Filarete (c 1400-c 1469), Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) and Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), utilised the body as a design tool. Modernism, especially Ernst Neufert (1900-1986), Charles Ramsey (1884-1963) and Harold Sleeper (1893-1960), incorporated it as a science. In the intervening period, following Laugier, images of architecture embedded and interrogated the body largely through theoreti- cal projects, stemming from the eighteenth- century French belief that truth could be attained through representation.? But before Laugier, there was an angst and uncertainty associated with the northern European body in the seventeenth century, which has been almost entirely overlooked by architectural historians. Only the maverick Georges Teyssot has ventured a one-word, all-encompassing description - 'mechanistic'.8 Likewise, considering that artists could be regarded as the chief architec- tural commentators of the Golden Age, studies on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Dutch architectural painting have inexplicably bypassed the subject. Scanning forward 300 years in the enduring body and building saga, we find that architec- # turai history is as polarised as art history. On one side, in postwar writing by Kenneth Frampton, Alberto Pérez-Gómez, Joseph Rykwert and Dalibor Veseley, the authors themselves repre- sent the body. In other words their body, as they know it, is their frame of reference, irrespective of period or place. This body can be 'musical', 'desirable' or 'renovated' body, but it remains, above all, anthropomorphic.9 On the other side of things, orbiting Princeton and its adjacent chemical factories, there is an understandable scientific and prosthetic urgency to Beatriz Colomina's 'medical' body, Greg Lynn's 'para- sitic' body, Teyssot's 'body without organs' and Anthony Vidier' s 'dismembered' body (a disfig- urement that seems as much a deliberate counter to Ivy League decorum as it was an apol- ogy to Foucault). This cohort questioned what the idea of the body might mean, in terms other than its literal corporeality, and recognised that 'when the body is no longer given a physical, social or political measure, or a measure of psy- chological content', the relationship of body to building changes.10 With the Interior of the Oude Kerk at Amsterdam , by contrast, the question is not: is the body part of the picture, but rather where and how is this body configured? In the absence of substantive architectural discourse or produc- tion, seventeenth-century Dutch drawings, engravings and paintings placed existing build- ings at the centre of the debate. In the Oude Kerk drawing, the inherent logic of the church's medieval builders is transfigured into an 'ode to the vital powers of the individual'. As Martin Bressani has indicated, this was also the crux of the Analytical Dictionary of French Architecture from the Eleventh to the Sixteenth Century (1854- 68), compiled by the nineteenth-century French architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879). 11 However, unlike Viollet-le-Duc's AA files 59</page><page sequence="2">Interior of the OudeKerk at Amsterdam, с 1655-60 Attributed to Jacob van Ruisdael © École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris</page><page sequence="3">autopsy-like analysis, with its anatomically and psychologically motivated drawings, the depic- tion of the Oude Kerk uniquely reinvests an ani- mated body. Susan Sontag, referring to the Dutch perspectivists, writes that 'all church inte- riors ... become "metaphysical" interiors in De Chirico's sense; that is, they speak of a necessary absence of the human'.12 By contrast, the literal absence of human figures in the church drawing suggests their totalising presence in the subject itself, in the same way that the 'depopulated designs' of Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527- c 1606) 'exude a near-modernist angst of an imagined and strange classical metropolis', further blurring the line between body and building. ^ The resulting complications and idiosyncrasies reaffirm the Holland of Huizinga as a place where the 'perceptual skills of the Dutch were a mixture of foreign and native, traditional and innovative elements'.14 Yet it is evidently not a benign descriptive modality, as claimed by Světlana Alpers in her groundbreak- ing The Art of Describing {1983), but a charged commentary on society, the status of the individ- ual and the sex of the body. Incidentally, by embodying the building, the artist also avoided the pitfalls of represent- ing the anatomical body. In seventeenth-century Dutch art these 'visual icons of Protestant sci- ence', as Jonathan Sawday calls them, were awk- ward and inaccurate and, like many church interiors, driven by a reliance on projective geometry, most notably in The Anatomy Lecture ofDrSebastiaenEgbertsz de Vrij (1619) by Werner van den Valckert (1585-1627) and its more famous successor, The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp (1632) by Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669). ^ When the body was not acting awkwardly, it was appropriated classically. The title page of the Flemish Andreas Vesalius's sem- inal On the Fabric of the Human Body (1543) 16 idealises the anatomy theatre in the form that became its prototypical model, a 'semi-circular, Tempietto-style structure'.17 The anatomical the- atre marked the emergence of a new knowledge about the body and symbolised a particular con- stellation of ideas and practices underlying what became the dominant conception of the body. Its inaugural moment was theatrical in charac- ter, and occurred in a theatrical space - one cos- mographie and church-like. However, in turning back to the Old Church in Amsterdam, it is important to note that it was not an unpopular subject. Emanuel De Witte (с 1617-1692) produced many views of it, although he only once (c 1660) executed an over- arching longitudinal view on a par with the Oude Kerk drawing. His more pronounced single point perspective is highly reminiscent of the Flemish masters and their ties to the Florentine sculptor and architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377~144б) and especially Alberti's system of linear perspective, which was also occasionally 72 adopted by a young Saenredam. The narrow 4cm sheet appended to the right-hand side of the Oude Kerk drawing is evidence of the extent of the artist's effort to preserve a comparable com- position. Yet while the drawing has been assigned a similar date (c 1655-60) to De Witte's, its 'perspective diagram' should not be disre- garded. In fact what is eclipsed amongst its chalk and pencil lines is the widely held view that 'if the body is to transcribe or project itself onto the building, then it must be operating at some distance from that which it is being projected upon [and that] this distance is formalised in Euclidean geometry and perspectivai models, which provide the conceptual framework for a relationship of division or alienation between the body/subject and its world/object'.18 The drawing, in this way, can be seen as synthesising the body and object, reaffirming Alpers' s claim that there is a multiplicity of visual cultures in modernity and that the Dutch handled the monocular 'Albertian picture' differently. Moreover, as Martin Jay summarised, 'rather than positing a privileged beholder outside the painting gazing on a theatricalised scene from afar, it [Dutch painting] placed the viewer inside the scene as an ambulatory presence'.19 Here, the orderly sequence of pulpit, lectern boards and chancel screen, with the vanishing point at its uppermost edge, marks a diminutive viewer about 1.7m high implausibly fixated on the ceil- ing. The actively seeking and enfranchised eye of this onlooker seems to indicate a freeing of the body from its obedience to the past and the sci- entific possessiveness of its present. At the same time, it checks Alpers' s argument that Dutch visual independence resulted in art's de-narra- tivisation: in other words, it was not designed to tell stories or teach morals, but to present a visual reality with no hidden message. Like the Oude Kerk drawing, Saenredam's and De Witte's mature church interiors are not derived from the classical body but question their existence in the context of modern culture. They are almost entirely preoccupied with the partial, often com- plex, diagonal view that historians have since revelled in untangling.20 However, De Witte's approach and ultimate rejection of classical taste - like Saenredam's at Utrecht and Haarlem or Houckgeest's at Delft - is not simply the result of the 'strain of living in a native pictorial tradi- tion while admiring, or being told they should admire, foreign ideals', as claimed by Thomas de Costa Kaufmann and Anthony Grafton. Rather, it tells us of an awakening to the pic- ture's potential to engage ideological positions via the body, whether it was one part of it - the eye - or the whole thing. Tying the architecture of the church to its humanist basis, ie, to its structure, was an important development from Francesco di Giorgio's passive but widely disseminated fifteenth-century two-dimensional pictorial emulation of the body all over the church. It means that the drawing's emphasis is not on the aesthetic austerity of the edifice - the skin of the body (also the Reformation's flashpoint) - but on its musculature and mass, its interiori ty. The twentieth-century's king of ideas, Michel Foucault, astutely attributed the 'early crystalli- sation of the modern western sense of interior- ity' to the overarching 'culture of dissection' of which this image is clearly a product. Here, the dissimulation of structure that is part and parcel of Saenredam's surfaces, whose 'delicate linear patterns ... have reminded many contemporary viewers of the surfaces of a Mondrian in nuce'21 and which forge an architecture based on signs that 'literally clothes the body politic' is dis- robed. This visibly less poised, more biological physique is the antithesis of the cultural core of Saenredam's images, which locate the truth of architecture in its visible outside, and subor- dinate the inside to that outside following the Greek conviction 'that inner content should con- form to outer beauty'.22 By contrast, the empha- sis of the Oude Kerk drawing ties it to Gothic obsessions with the mechanical arts, the prevail- ing architectural sentiment in most northern circles, as opposed to the idealised concerns of the fashionable coterie of classicists (Jacob Van Campen, Pieter Post and Philips Vingboons) or the handful of high-minded 'perspectivists'. The accusation by Harry Francis Maligrave that the Thirty Years' War (1618-48) brought north- ern European architectural activity 'to a grinding halt' seems, in this light, to be overstating things. 2з Nevertheless, there was an eclipsing of the limited amount of Dutch theory, then domi- nated by conventional Italian influences. The Venetian Vincenzo Scamozzi (1548-1616) was probably the raciest reference, except for the extreme case of Salomon de Bray (1597-1664), whos e Architectura Moderna (1631) - a title rich in irony - presents architecture as the manifesta- tion of Christian religious certainty derived from Solomon's Temple. Paradoxically more pagan, the Oude Kerk drawing recalls and recasts Vitruvian Man, whose ideal form was famously interpreted by Leonardo (1492). His late fifteenth-century image of 'the male body standing upright with arms extended, inscribed within a circle and a square ... compositionally complete, confidently stable and hierarchically ordered'24 is the centre- piece for any investigation of 'body building' . Still a diagram in the sense that it places a figure within a predetermined frame, the somewhat distended and incomplete circle and square of the Oude Kerk drawing plays a key icono- graphie role in manifesting the 'erosion of confi- dence' in the classical model. The unified body of the Vitruvian image was taken as the exemplar for classical architecture (in other words, build- ings were to mimic the order, harmony and pro- portions of the Vitruvian body, AA files 59</page><page sequence="4">26. Wigley, op cit , p 336. and consequently establish a theological rela- tionship between the body and architecture). We know, as Rudolf Wittkower notes, that 'with- out that organic geometrical equilibrium of Vitruvius, where all the parts are harmonically related like the members of a body, divinity can- not reveal itself.25 As a thirteenth-century build- ing that had undergone extensive refiguration, the Old Church is in many ways an unaccommo- dating subject. Or, does this historical impulse make it an ideal one? Calling such attention to the dissonant parts of both body and building would suggest that marginalising religion is one of the image's more straightforward objectives. And through this diminishment, we can see that this complex body is visibly different to Saenredam's, in whose precision-driven hands the same two tools - graphite and chalk - produce what Alpers terms Views of architecture viewed'. Saenredam followed a surgical-like procedure of carefully measured preparatory drawings that lead to a painstaking execution in panel painting. By con- trast, the Oude Kerk drawing's anti-representa- tional stance and vitalism result from the draughtsman's obsessive overdrawing and washing to camouflage faint measured pencil lines. Its roughness and imperfection, not to mention its overall exposition of the church nave's anatomy, are essential in conveying the building's physiological attributes. By switching the focus away from 'gross anatomy' to an expression of structures and functions invisible to the naked eye (paralleling the invention of the compound microscope), this drawing also cre- ates an association with medical chambers and cavities, including depictions and descriptions of the body's inner organs by a more mature Leonardo, Vesalius and William Harvey (1578-1657). More osteologically, the nave's volume is underpinned by the aisles, which are drawn like bones/scaffolding supporting the functioning body/vessel. The consequence of this is to present the fleeting aspect of this image as not only unusual but seemingly modern. One senses that each part has its own configuration but is nonetheless a prisoner of a system of forces that is both stable and always in tension - a remarkable impression of corporeality, injected with an almost palpable vital flow, dominates the drawing, from the exoskeleton of its ceiling to the skin of its stone floor. Within this frame, the Oude Kerk' s draughtsman appreciably amplifies the church's volume, and consequently heightens the magnitude of the body. Ironically, the effect of this is to make it less alien as a Ruisdael. Two of Ruisdael's most famous subjects draw their power by exaggeration. Both versions of The Jewish Cemetery (c 1655) are sophisticated reconfigurations of a much simpler site and, as is well documented, his earlier Bentheim Castle (1653) is depicted much taller that it is in reality. It is also plain to see that the Old Church has been stripped of every accessory. Even the chan- deliers, so prominent in De Witte's longitudinal view, have been removed. What the drawing projects is thus not the phenomenon of the building's social space, but its inherent political space. Furthermore, the omission of extraneous details heightens the effect of the church's void and thereby the essential structure of the body. This suggests a particular comparison to the female form, a body type on the margin of archi- tectural discourse, but for the somewhat hack- neyed interpretation of the Corinthian column type (in the Oude Kerk drawing all columns are essentially asexual) and Mark Wigley' s equally laboured relocation of the ideal of domesticity into Alberti.26 In the Oude Kerk drawing the body's sexuality is controlled through the ceil- ing, an architectural element almost absent from Dutch 'perspectives'. The result is that the church presents, on the one hand, a general expression of the body's dynamic forces, while the corporeality of its enclosure suggests on the other hand an alteration of the body's sex, trans- forming the building from public space to private space and reconfiguring the role of the female in relation to an 'Albertian view' that has always privileged man. By comparison, what does Saenredam - the acclaimed 'first portraitist of architecture' - do to the body in his Utrecht pictures? He frag- ments it, just like De Witte at Amsterdam and Delft. But this disappropriation is not so much innovation or anatomical dissection (as is typi- cally maintained), as it is a butcher-like cleaving of the building - a partitioning that exemplifies his savage contempt for the Italian thesis of the unified whole. The body can no longer centre, fix or stabilise. In its dismemberment it becomes an abstract, unrecognisable body/ object. As a consequence, it is not just a 'new aesthetic function' that Saenredam gives to the church, but an essential role in formulating a new society. In this sense, I would argue that you have to extract this drawing from the narrow field of Dutch art history that it occupies, so caught up with 'problems of authorship' that Michel Foucault or Světlana Alpers might never have existed. We all know that this goes against all the evidence. When Inventory Number #1962 is lifted from its preservation box in the archives of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, it is not the body of the signatory (whoever that may be) that really counts, but the body within the picture. 1.
