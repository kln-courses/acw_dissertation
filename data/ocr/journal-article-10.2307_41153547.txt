<plain_text><page sequence="1">Performers and Performance in the Earliest Serious Secular Plays in the Netherlands Willem M. H. Hummelen The literature of the Netherlands is as rich in sixteenth- century manuscripts of plays and printed plays (approximately six hundred are extant) as it is poor in fifteenth-century play texts (approximately twenty). Of the latter group of texts about half are contained in the so-called Hulthem manuscript dating from 1405-10; these ten plays, however, may be assumed to have originated in the fourteenth century and hence are in fact the earliest vernacular plays that have come down to us in the Netherlands. However, the small number of extant early plays is compensated for by the high quality of the texts. Moreover, this group of ten plays occupies a special place in the dramatic literature of Western Europe, for along with l'Estoire de Griseldis (c.1395) it includes the earliest serious secular plays and, aside from Le Garçon et l'aveugle (с. 1282), the oldest known farces in the vernacular. 1 In the present article I intend to show that this special position also includes the performance of the plays by masked professional actors on a stage with a tiring house that has at least two entrances to the front stage. The Hulthem manuscript contains an extensive and very heterogeneous collection of texts. It is thought to have served as the catalogue of a scriptorium from which the customer could choose his own collection of texts - texts that then were copied out for him. The ten fourteenth-century plays have come down to us in the form of five "scripts" - that is, five texts prepared for the production of one or more stage performances. WILLEM M. H. HUMMELEN, Emeritus Professor of Older Dutch Literature at the University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands, has published widely on Dutch drama and theater of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 Comparative Drama Each script consists of what, for lack of a better term, may be referred to as a primary play (between 625 and 1142 lines in length), followed by a sotternie (a short farce, between 111 and 245 lines). Four of the primary plays are described as abele spelen ("fine plays") in the titles of the scripts. Three of these "fine plays"- Esmoreit, Gloriant, and Lanseloet van Denemerken - concern events that take place in the circles of the nobility and hence may also be described as "knights' stories."2 In most cases in which the "fine plays" are mentioned, these three dramas are usually implied, and it is the scripts of these plays which I intend to discuss here. The contents of the plays under discussion may be summarized as follows: 1. Esmoreit. Esmoreit, the only child of the king of Sicily, is kidnapped at birth by Robbrecht, one of the king's nephews who is determined to replace the monarch as successor to the throne. In Damascus the court magician reads in the stars that Esmoreiťs birth implies great disaster for his lord, the king. The magician is sent to find and obtain Esmoreit, and, after having traveled to Sicily, he manages to purchase him from Robbrecht. In Damascus Princess Damiet, who raises Esmoreit as her brother at her father's command, knows only that he was found in the palace garden. Meanwhile, back in Sicily, Robbrecht blackens the queen's reputation so seriously that his uncle sends her to prison for many years. When Esmoreit has reached adulthood, he accidentally hears Damiet sighing about her love for him in spite of his obscure origin. However, he cannot requite her love until he has discovered the identity of his true ancestors. His quest will take him to Sicily where his mother recognizes him from her prison cell by the em- broidered cloth in which he was wrapped as a baby. The queen is restored to honor, Esmoreit is reunited with Damiet who had followed him in disguise, and Robbrecht is exposed by the court magician who had accompanied Damiet on her journey. The play ends with the stage direction "Hier hanct men Robbrechť ("Robbrecht is hanged here"). This play is followed by the sotternie, Lippijn, which is a characteristic example of the farces that typically follow the primary plays. Lippijn's wife, having ordered her husband to do various household chores, leaves the house for a secret rendezvous with her lover. By chance, however, Lippijn passes by and sees his wife committing adultery. Looking around for</page><page sequence="3">Willem M. H. Hummelen 21 a stick, he intends to beat the lovers. However, in a roundabout way one of his wife's friends manages to convince him that what he has seen is not real but the result of an overactive imagination, inspired by the devil; further, she assures him that his wife is at home at that very moment. Meanwhile, Lippijn's wife takes the opportunity to run to her house3 so that, when he finds her there, he must admit that he has been wrong. Further, she beats him for having suspected her of adultery. 2. Gloriant. No woman is good enough for Gloriant, Duke of Brunswijk. Florentijn, an equally proud Saracen princess, hears of his reputation and orders a messenger to take to him a picture of herself. Gloriant falls in love with her, and the messenger is sent back with the information that her portrait has thus affected him. Then, in spite of his uncle's warnings, Gloriant himself sets forth to visit Florentijn. On their first meeting, however, they are watched by her cousin Floerant, who, stealing Gloriant's sword while the lovers are sleeping, warns her father. The lovers are apprehended, and both sent- enced to death. But Florentijn's messenger helps Gloriant to escape from prison, and together they then set her free at the very moment when she is to be executed. The three of them thereafter will safely travel to Brunswijk. 3. Lanseloet van Denemerken. Lancelot, prince of Denmark, is in love with Sanderijn, his mother's chambermaid. Opposing a marriage with a girl of such humble birth, his mother offers to help him to arrange a secret meeting with her on condition that he will pretend to be filled with disgust at her once he has deprived her of her honor. Everything happens as planned, and Sanderijn, taking Lancelot's insults to be sincere, flees from the court in desperation. A knight who finds her in the forest is impressed by her dignified manner and marries her. Lancelot, regretting his action, orders a servant to set out to find her - a task which will be successful, though she refuses to return to the prince. To prevent a war, the servant tells his lord that she has died. On hearing this news, Lancelot dies of grief. Most Dutch critics who have commented on the abele spelen have assumed that the performers of these plays were local groups of amateurs or members of the circle of professional reciters who performed at local courts.4 The accounts of these courts indeed frequently mention such reciters, but they are</page><page sequence="4">22 Comparative Drama never paid as performers of plays. A link between the abele spelen and masked professional actors was first noted in 1914 by Max Hermann in his work on the illustrations in the edition of Terence's comedies printed at Lyon in 1493.5 Hermann believed that the Flemish humanist Jodocus Badius Ascensius (Joost de Bruine of Assche, near Brussels), who was involved in the editing of Terence's comedies, had a connection also with the Dutch abele spelen, particularly with those involving knights' stories, as indicated in a passage in the preface of a later reprint of the Terence edition. In this passage Badius explains why masks were used in theatrical performances in classical antiquity: Una est quia varium et pleniorem sonum reddunt. A personando enim dicitur persona, eo quod per varias personas vox unius ho- minis varie sonat. Ideoque qui historias regum principumque in cameris precio ludunt, ut nunc vulgo est videre in flandria et regionibus vicinis, varias personas accipiunt, ut unus actor seu lusor vários posset presentare. Alia causa est quia opus est ali- quando representare personam infantis, aliquando adolescentis, aliquando viri, aliquando senis, aliquando decrepiti, aliquando regis, aliquando principis, aliquando cursoris, aliquando agricolae, aliquando mercatoris, aliquando traditoris aut hominis perfidi, quo circa necesse est varias sibi sumere personas. (fol. 6ar) (One [of the reasons why they are used] is that they alter and amplify the sound of one's voice. The word persona [mask] is derived from per-sonare [sounding through something] because the voice of one person sounds different coming through different masks. For this reason masks are used by the performers who, for a remuneration, act out the adventures of kings and ladies in chambers, as we see everywhere today in Flanders and different neighboring regions [italics mine]. These performers use different masks so that one performer or actor can play different parts. Another reason for using masks is that sometimes an actor has to play the part of a child and sometimes that of a young man, or a grown man, or an elderly man, or an ancient man, or sometimes that of a king, a lord, a messenger, a farmer, a merchant, a traitor, or a shady character, which makes it necessary to use different masks.) According to Hermann, this passage can only refer to per- formances of the type represented by the abele spelen based on knights' stories. Hermann's comment, however, has been largely ignored by the Dutch critics of the abele spelen. His conjecture may indeed be set aside as an idle thought until further confirmation is obtained concerning Badius' statement regarding the Flemish drama of his time and a more detailed study is made of the texts of the abele spelen as well as of the</page><page sequence="5">Willem M. H. Hummelen 23 form in which they have come down to us. "Badius' information is most interesting but we need much more solid evidence about this before we can conclude with Hermann and Stumpft that these and suchlike dramas were performed in the Low Countries by masked actors," Hunningher concluded in 1964.6 In the meantime, Oskar Lenz, in his unpublished thesis on the Terence illustrations, had associated Badius with the masked actors, referred to as joculatores, in the well-known title illu- stration of the so-called Terence des Ducs (Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, MS. 664) dating from с. 1400.7 The masks here are different from those shown in the oldest Terence illustrations; they are not all of the same color, and they do not have the great rounded mouth-opening which had been a characteristic of the Greek and Roman masks. The evidence at least confirms the existence of such masked actors around the end of the fourteenth century and the beginning of the fifteenth century. An invitation to a Rhetoricians' competition to be held in 1496 in Antwerp, moreover, shows that Badius knew very well what he was talking about: Item dat alle camerspelers hier uijt sijn geseght die op cameren gespelt hebben ofte noch doen, te weten historien ofte cronijcken vanden banieren die sij costumelijck uijthanghen, oock de gene die op de selve cameren esbatementen om winninghe gespelt heb- ben, ende dat nochtans naer de feeste van Lovené. . . . Ende insgelijcx oock alle spraeck sprekers, rolleschrijvers ende dierge- lijcken sijn hier uijtgesteken, niet to haer versmaetheden maer om te laetene alien hertten ende goetwilligen den wegh te badt ende geneughelijcxste besoigneren, ten waere dat die selve tsijnder behoorelijcke ende ghewonelijcke beteringhe gedaen hadden.8 (Item, that all chamber actors, who have acted out in chambers the histories and chronicles as announced on the banners they usually display, are excluded from participation. Also excluded are the actors who, for a reward, have performed farces in such chambers, particularly following the competition at Louvain [in 1498]. On the same terms all persons are excluded from participa- tion who have become professional reciters, verse composers, etc. We do not wish to discredit these persons, but our aim is to give all those who have shown themselves of good will the best and most pleasant opportunity to partake in the competition. The above-mentioned exceptions do not apply if the persons implied have in the meantime done due penance in the usual manner.) This passage confirms that at the end of the fifteenth century indoor stage performances were organized, especially involving plays with serious secular subjects and for which an entrance</page><page sequence="6">24 Comparative Drama fee was charged. The fact that the passage mentions cameren (the plural form) implies that the plays were not performed by locally established actors but by a traveling troupe. The invitation to the competition in 1496 also provides the Dutch name for such professional actors: camerspelers ("chamber actors"). If we then turn to sixteenth-century dictionaries to observe the meaning of this word, we find that camerspel is understood to be a show in a confined or private area - a performance for which an entrance fee is charged. In the first instance, a show consisted of a stage performance, but it could also involve acrobatics or dancing. The term also may refer to such activities as conjuring, juggling, and rope dancing. These are exactly the forms of entertainment that are ascribed to the joculatores. We thus may assume continuity from the masked joculatores of the Terence des Ducs - a manuscript which, according to the editor, Henry Martin, contains illustrations that betray Dutch influences9 - to the masked chamber actors who are reported to have performed "in Flandria et regionibus vicinis" less than a century later. In my opinion, the chamber actors should not be regarded as extremely versatile artists but rather as specialists performing independently or in constantly changing companies. Some of the specializations required a higher level of skill than others, and we may surmise that those that are absent or rare in amateur circles would have been the more exclusive. For example, it would have been more difficult to penetrate circus- like specializations than mime. Thus the distinction made be- tween amateur performers and professional actors in the invita- tion to the 1496 competition becomes understandable. It is quite conceivable that a locally evolved group of amateurs gradually developed to become a professional company which then began to travel, or that members of such a troupe, deciding to give up traveling and professional acting, may have chosen to earn a living in a different trade instead. However, this does not alter the fact that the true amateurs were an altogether different group - a distinction which only became more apparent in the sixteenth century. The existence of chamber actors cannot be denied. Further study of the abele spelen or "fine plays" and the way in which these dramas have come down to us may reveal more points of contact between the chamber actors and the plays than those</page><page sequence="7">Willem M. H. Hummelen 25 delineated by Max Hermann. These points of contact include: (1) the repertory, (2) the professional character of the per- formances, and (3) the use of masks. Repertory. Badius mentions serious secular plays; the invita- tion to the 1496 competition also refers to esbatementen, which in this context must be understood to be farces. The translation of the term camerspeler as "joueur de farce" in a sixteenth- century dictionary also indicates that the repertory of the cham- ber actors included comic plays. 10 The similarity between the plays in the Hulthem manuscript and the plays performed by the chamber actors is therefore not limited to the subject matter of the serious plays (knights' stories) but also involves the combination of such plays with farces. The fact that the ten plays have come down to us in the form of scripts - scripts of great similarity in content and composition - and the remark- able fact that they are all found close together in the same manuscript point to one and the same performing body. Up to this point, all students of this drama have agreed that we are here dealing with a repertory of a company of actors, and to this I would add that it was a company of actors with a pre- ference for secular subjects and for the combining of plays such as those based on knights' stories with short farces, for it is unlikely that the uniform characteristics of the group of scripts are to be traced back merely to the scribe who copied the Hulthem manuscript. The idea was that every customer would find texts to his liking in the manuscript. The coupling of primary plays to sotternieën is of importance in this respect because of the connecting texts involving speeches addressed to the audience and containing practical directions used to link the two together. We find similar practical directions at the end of the sotternie. It is such passages that turn the combination of a primary play and a sotternie into a script. In the scripts of Esmoreit and Gloriant, directions of this kind reveal the con- ditions under which the director thought the plays were supposed to be performed.il The Professional Character of the Performances. Both in Badius and in the invitation to the 1496 competition, the charge of an entrance fee (which may be considered a criterion of the professional character of the performances) is closely connected with indoor acting. Performing in chambers was so characteristic of the professional actors that from this activity they received</page><page sequence="8">26 Comparative Drama their name. This means that the members of the audience, who were informed about the play by the banners that had apparently been hung out for that purpose, came to the actors (and not the actors to the audience). Anyone who could afford the entrance fee was welcome irrespective of his or her social status. In the practical directions addressed to the members of the audience in the scripts containing Esmoreit and Gloriant, they are requested to remain seated for awhile, and later the specta- tors are all asked to stand and descend the stairs. In the Middle Ages spectators were sometimes given a seat on a scaffold, but this was a privilege reserved for the upper classes and dignitaries and not shared by the entire audience. Therefore this passage cannot apply to such a scaffold, but must imply the stairs in a house. The performances for which these directions were written must consequently have taken place on an upper story Д 2 This is a quite obvious location for these performances if we consider that the meeting halls of Chambers of Rhetoric, the oldest of which originated in the course of the fifteenth century, were almost always situated in an upper story above, for example, the weighhouse, the town gates, the clothmakers' hall, etc. The fact that they were situated mainly in public buildings is not only indicative of a form of governmental subsidy, for on such upper stories a large floor area was avail- able which was not subdivided by supporting walls and which was therefore suitable for private stage performances and rehearsals. From a sixteenth-century source we know that folding chairs were usually brought along to performances of chamber plays. 13 Very likely, therefore, there was no raised stage. If the plays were performed without a raised stage and in a relatively small area - that is, with only a short distance between the audience and the actors - the audience must have been seated because otherwise only the first two or three rows of spectators would have been able to see the performance. In illustrations from (once again) the sixteenth century showing an audience watch- ing an outdoor performance of a play, the spectators are always shown standing, with the exception of those who are seated on a scaffold or are shown behind the windows of adjacent houses, in trees, and on roofs .1 4 In the aforementioned practical directions, the audience is also asked to return the next day. Of course, such a request would not have been made if the actors had been invited to</page><page sequence="9">Willem M. H. Hummelen 27 perform the play - e.g., in the count's castle. Thus it is demon- strated that these were public performances that were open to everybody. Records of stage performances that were con- tinued on a number of successive days (with the exception of competitions) from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are extremely rare and always involve the continuation of the play that had been started on the previous day. The aforementioned passages in the scripts of Esmoreit and Gloriant, however, do not announce a continuation or point to a contextual connec- tion, but are simply intended as advertising. In these cases the concentration of the performances on successive days indicates that the plays were not performed by a group of locally estab- lished performers but by a troupe of actors on tour. Such conditions may explain why no raised stage was used. Public stage performances, held indoors, by a traveling company of professional actors - these are all points of simi- larity with the chamber actors. But the passages on which my argument has been based were written for a particular produc- tion and therefore in all probability are more recent than the play texts themselves. What can be deduced from the practical directions - addressed to the spectators regarding the conditions under which the plays were performed and the actors who performed them - does not necessarily apply to the plays them- selves in the form in which they originated, possibly several decades earlier. 15 These added or adapted practical directions, however, do prove that the performing conditions - and the group of actors to which reference is made - existed at the time of the copying of the manuscript in which the texts have come down to us. They also may represent earlier practice. In any case, they do not support the theory that the abele spelen were performed by groups of citizen-amateurs. The fact that such locally estab- lished groups do appear in municipal accounts and in the accounts of noble courtsl6 (whereas we have no such clear evidence concerning the activities of traveling troupes of pro- fessional actors) does not mean very much. After all, the lack, so far as I know, of any mention of camerspelers in municipal accounts and ordinances until 1583 does not lessen the value of the information contained in Badius' statement and in the invitation to the 1496 competition. Masks. The extensive data documenting the religious drama</page><page sequence="10">28 Comparative Drama of the late Middle Ages presented by Peter Meredith and John E. Tailby show that the use of masks only very exceptionally involved ordinary people, but illustrate their use especially by the devil and his train of followers. Π The exceptions, however, include cases which presumably drew upon non-speaking char- acters in pageants as well as dummies. Thus while Badius' reference to the masks of the chamber actors sounds implausible at first, in various sixteenth-century sources masks nevertheless seem to have been regarded as characteristic of chamber actors. On the other hand, Rhetoricians are emphatically advised against using masks. In the records and the play texts of the Rhetoricians I have in fact only encountered devil and animal masks. 18 The use of masks is so important because several conclusions can be drawn from this practice. Badius himself associates the use of masks with doubling, and this in itself indicates a rather small company of actors. In professional acting doubling would indeed be understandable, since otherwise the receipts from playing would need to be divided among too many actors. 19 Yet in connection with any discussion of doubling it must be pointed out that the abele spelen based on knights' stories required only a few actors: between five and seven in Esmoreit, between four and eight in Gloriant, and between three and six in Lanseloet van Denemerken. But there is a further point which needs to be made. The religious drama of the Middle Ages did not aim at systematically minimizing the number of actors; in the rare cases in which it employed doubling, it was not only a matter of a lack of actors but also lack of space for a larger number of actors.20 In principle, each actor played one part. During the performance he was constantly within sight because when he was not acting he retreated to his station. When an actor had finished his part of the performance, he was allowed to go home, though it was considered more seemly to remain at one's station until the end of the performance. The information published by Meredith and Tailby regarding concealment and the changing of costumes shows that there was an attempt to conceal the contrast between what was happening at the level of the character and what was happening at the level of the actor. An actor playing the role of Adam needed to remain out of sight until the moment of his creation; if a character was to be beheaded, he was secretly replaced by a dummy. The same principle applied in the case of metamor- phoses, both those resulting from the fact that one actor played</page><page sequence="11">Willem M. H. Hummelen 29 different roles and also the symbolic changes in appearance that could create confusion if they were to take place in sight of the audience. It is thus highly unlikely that actors who used different masks would have changed them in the line of vision of the audience. The use of masks therefore implies the systematic use of something that was only used incidentally in religious drama - namely, a backstage where masks (and also costumes) could be changed. From backstage, therefore, actors could enter, and to this space they could make an exit, in the present meaning of these terms. The combination of a small number of actors and play texts like those of the abele spelen based on knights' stories had an important consequence for the backstage space. This type of drama presupposes at least two different locations (Sicily and Damascus, Brunswijk and Abelant, the palace in Denmark and the home of Sanderijn's husband). If a text like that of Lanseloet van Denemerken was performed with a minimum of three actors, one of them inevitably was required to play a role with scenes set in Denmark and another in the scenes set in the country of Sanderijn's husband. During the performance he then had to move from one station to another without this movement having any meaning. Usually such a movement represented a journey. If a play were to have included movements without meaning as well as movements that did have a certain signification, the audience would have become con- fused. Therefore, the movements without meaning must have been hidden from the audience's view. The necessity of such action means that the backstage of one station (Denmark) had to be connected with that of the other (the country of Sanderijn's husband). In other words, there was a speelhuys, to use the sixteenth-century Dutch term signifying a tiring house. Such a space could be realized quite easily indoors, inside a room, by hanging a curtain from wall to wall and making different open- ings in it through which the actors could enter the stage. In a recent performance of Esmoreit at Lancaster, Eng- land^ 1 Sicily and Damascus were separated stations with the non-playing actors sitting on a bench between the two. Such a staging gives the audience far more opportunity for visual infor- mation than a performance against a scenae frons copied from the Lyons Terence. But this type of staging is also far more expensive to construct, and it would be impossible to stage indoors in a room or chamber.</page><page sequence="12">30 Comparative Drama Four different characteristics which not only presuppose the presence of a tiring house of the type described above but also are completely or almost completely unknown in religious drama may be pointed out in the "fine plays" based on knights' stories (abele spelen). These may hardly be regarded as having originated or developed on a stage on which no entries or exits could be made. The first of these characteristics may be observed in the way in which a character already on stage always announces what I suppose to be the entry of another character to the iformula "Waer sidi ... ?" ("Where are you ... ?"). This formula inevitably serves as a cue. Second, we observe the repeated occurrence of a formula used by a character to explain what I suppose to be his or her exit, an "exit pretext" - e.g., "Met bliden moede willen wi gaen eten want die tafel es bereet" ("Let us go with cheerful gladness, to eat, for the table is set") (Esmoreit, 11. 840-41). The third involves movements from one country to an- other - movements which are represented in two different ways. The character either bridged the distance while speaking, or stopped speaking at one station and then started speaking (after an interim scene) at the other. The first may correspond to a movement across the "proscenium" - that is, in front of the curtain, the second to a movement within the tiring house. The latter was the practice in the sixteenth century. Finally, there is the use of a specific combination of dramatic irony and simultaneity. On stage two situations are represented simultaneously - e.g., Damiet giving vent to her feelings while Esmoreit, who had been sleeping behind a bush, wakes up. In such simultaneous presentation, a climax may be reached when something is said in one situation which is definitely not intended to be heard in the other - in this case, the information that Esmoreit is not Damiet's brother but instead is an abandoned child. There are several moments like this in the abele spelen based on knights' stories. It goes without saying that curtains are ideal for rendering such situations on stage. These four characteristics set the abele spelen or "fine plays" uniquely apart in medieval drama as a whole, and from the standpoint of staging they argue in my opinion for the view that the extant play texts were intended to be performed on a stage with a tiring house. I must point out that I am not rely- ing here for evidence on the practical directions addressed to</page><page sequence="13">Willem M. H. Hummelen 31 the audience which have been added to the play texts, for I am examining the plays themselves. The combination of profes- sional actors and the use of masks (of the kind to which Badius makes reference and which the sixteenth-century chamber actors used) explains the practical directions as well as certain pecu- liarities in the dramas themselves. The practical directions and the play texts must of necessity have been quite closely con- nected, and a hypothesis that provides an explanation for certain aspects of production involving both of these must gain in credibility.22 NOTES l For these two French plays, see Grace Frank, The Medieval French Drama (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1954), pp. 156, 224. UEstoire de Griseldis is the earliest serious French play that is not a religious drama, while Le Garçon et l'aveugle is the oldest extant farce in French. 2 The standard edition of all ten plays in the Hulthem manuscript is still Middelnederlandsche dramatische Poezie, ed. P. Leendertz (Leiden: Sijthoff, 1899- 1907), pp. 1-159. The best modern edition of the four abele spelen and their farces is De abele spelen, ed. L. van Kämmen (Amsterdam: Athenaeum, 1968), and the best individual editions of the three plays based on knights' stories are Een abel spel van Lanseloet van Denemerken, 8th ed., ed. R. Roemans and H. van Assche (Ant- werp: De Nederlandse Boekhandel, 1982); Een abel spel van Esmoreit, 3rd ed., ed. R. Roemans and H. van Assche (Antwerp: De Nederlandse Boekhandel, 1977); and Een abel spel van Gloriant, 2nd ed., ed. R. Roemans and H. van Assche (Antwerp: De Nederlandsche Boekhandel, 1970). For English translations of these plays, see "An Excellent Play of Esmoreit, Prince of Sicily," trans. Jane Oakshott and Elsa Strietman, Dutch Crossing, 30 (1986), 3-39; and A Beautiful Play of Lancelot of Denmark, trans. P. Geyl (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, [1924]). The fourth "fine play" is Vanden winter ende vanden somer (Of Winter and Summer), which treats the question of which of the two seasons is preferable. The primary play of the fifth script is a long farce, Drie daghe here (The Lord for Three Days), which is once again followed by a sot ternie. 3 In an earlier publication, I defended the opinion that to achieve a comic effect the wife should not be visible when she goes from her lover to her home; see W. M. H. Hummelen, "Tekst en toneelinrichting in de abele spelen," De Nieuwe Taalgids, 70 [1977], 234). I suggested that this evidence indicated the possibility of going from one station to another behind the curtains. I now think that the dialogue between Lippijn and his wife's friend is so extraordinarily long (84 lines out of a total of 199 Unes) and also in itself of such small interest that it should be inter- preted as an attempt by the friend to distract his interest from his wife's movements. This of course implies that these movements are visible. 4 See W. J. A. Jonckbloet, Geschiedenis der Nederlandsche letterkunde, 3rd. ed.

In the case of Vander winter ende vanden somer, the last übe of the abele spelen simply rhymes with the first Une of the sotternie. 12 It seems plausible that what applies to Esmoreit and Gloriant also applies at least to Lanseloet van Denemerken because of the close resemblance of the different scripts. 13 Marcus van Vaeraewijck, Van die beroerlicke tijden in die Nederlanden en voornamelick in Ghendt, 1566Ί568, ed. F. Vanderhaeghen (Ghent, 1872-82), II, 170. 14 See, for example, the illustrations in W. M. H. Hummelen, "Toneel op de kermis, van Brueghel tot Bredero," Oud Holland, 103 (1989), 1-45. 15 The text of Lippijn also alludes to a seated audience; on the other hand, reference in D rie daghe here is to a standing audience. 16 While they were sometimes allowed to receive more money for the perform- ances than their amateur status would normally have permitted, they must neverthe- less be regarded as locally established groups; see Jeanette Hollaar and Ε.

Tailby, Early Drama, Art, and Music, Monograph Ser., 4 (Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publi- cations, 1982), pp. 103, 120, 128, 141-43, and passim; see also Stumpfl, "Schauspiel- masken," p. 59. 18 Significantly, no masks are mentioned in the inventories of the Chamber of Rhetoric De Witte Acoleyen at Leiden (1597; see J. G. С A. Briels, "Reyn Genuecht: Zuidnederlandse kamers van Rhetorica in Noordnederland 1585-1630," Bijdragen tot de geschiendenis, 57 [1974], 69-70), the Chamber De Pellicanisten at Haarlem (1610; Archives of Trou Moet Blijcken, Book R, fols. 32r-34v), and the Chamber De Rapenbloem at Delft (Gemeente-archief Delft, Archief Nederlandse Hervormde Gemeente, memoranda of the "Kamer van Charitate" dd. 10 Aug. 1617 and 10 June 1618). In the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, masks for a devil or Death are mentioned sporadically, mostly as part of the dress of vices (see W. M. H. Hummelen, De sinnekens in het rederijkersdrama [Groningen: Wolters, 1958], pp. 46-50). One of the vices depicted in an engraving after David Vinckboons (c.1602) wears an animal mask and part of an animal's fur pelt (see Hummelen, "Toneel op de kermis, van Bruegel tot Bredero," p. 15, fig. 11; possibly meant as parts of a devil's garment). The only clearly anthropomorphic masks known to me are those of St. Mary, the Magi, the angel with the star, and apostles, the prophets, and a messenger as characters in the Great Pageant at s'-Hertogenbosch (see D. Roggen, "J. Bosch: literature en folklore," Gentse bijdragen tot de kunstgeschiedenis, 6 [1939-40], 117).</page><page sequence="15">Willem M. H.

Press, 1962), chaps. I-V. 20 The Staging of Religious Drama, ed. Meredith and Tailby, p. 53. 21 Esmoreit was performed, using the translation by Oakshott and Strietman, at the Sixth Triennial Colloquium of the International Society for the Study of Medieval Theater on 13-19 July 1989; the production was directed by Meg Twycross. 22 Translated by Susan Mellon</page></plain_text>
