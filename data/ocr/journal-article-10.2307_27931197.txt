<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Egyptian God at Shechem By G. R. H. Wright Abgelagert im afrikanischen Keller f?r Arnulf Kuschke With savage pictures fill the gaps I An attempt to suggest the existence of a cult with Egyptian antecedents at Shechem - and what are the majority of such opinions about the long ago but suggestions - proceeds by way of an enquiry which in essentials is a literary enquiry. It stems from a figure who lives and has his being expressed in literature. There is nothing material surviving which relates to the figure, no contemporary object nor record, but there are to read words, words, words - telling a story, drawing a character. This likeness taken with many facets, this portrait in words is an unmistakable image. It presents one of the masks of man - i.e. a god. It is the Semitic Hamlet, the Oedipus of the East. What is said of such a figure is not verbiage of arbitrary fancy. Such words are not idle, they are a product of logical necessity. They form the written versions of myth, saga and folk tale1. What is the validity, indeed what is the ontology of considerations emerging from an analysis of these entities is a basic question of philosophy or psychology not in place here. Only it may be stated that the general views expressed on this basic question are relevant here. The earliest of the literary compositions considered must date from five hundred to a thousand years after the events it purports to describe, other compositions are a thousand years later. Within speculation relating to Hebrew Palestine of Old Testament times, it is customary to call only the earlier literature into account, not the latter. In analogous fields of enquiry this is not so. For example, the Greek god, Dionysos, is closely related to the figure under discussion here. Our knowledge of Dionysos is derived in the main from classical literature. An early source is the Homeric Hymn (vii) which was written sometime before say 500 B.C. Different details and aspects of Dionysos are presented by, e. g. Athenagoras2 and Firmicus Maternus3 who wrote almost one thousand years later. However, it would be crass on that account alone to say that the information concerning Dionysos offered by these authors is less "reliable" than that in the Homeric Hymn. Specifically, if it is a question of origins which is being considered, then any "historic origins" (i. e. non-mental phenomena indepen dent of human understanding) occurred long prior to the first written record, so that this record is per se of no greater value as direct historical evidence than another. 1 A rationalistic examination of Myth, saga, folk tale is provided by A. H. Krappe, The Science of Folk Lore (London 1965). Lord Raglan, The Hero (New York 1956), gives a simplistic view of some of the present issues. 2 V. Athenagoras, Libellus pro christianis, 20. 3 V. Firmicus Maternus, De errore VI, 5.</page><page sequence="2">96 G. R. H. Wright Whatever conclusions then may be deduced concerning an Egyptian God at Shechem, prior notice is given that the evidence is basically literary. However, it must also be pointed out that the analysis of the Biblical "documents" according to the Wellhausian scheme and its refinements has nothing to determine in this connection. Such an analysis may or may not pertain to the biblical material under discussion4. No matter. What is at issue here is the "nature" of the literature which stands behind the documents be they edited or published in this, that or any manner and form whatsoever. Finally it must be observed that other, non-literary evidence is adduced, but without the literary data this evidence would never be called into question. The question would not exist. For example, the extensive archaeological excavations carried on at Shechem over fifty years and more provide information which gives interpretive background to the literary record; but in themselves these excavations have nothing to say on the question of a cult at Shechem with Egyptian origins. II The patriarch Joseph is a biblical figure much discussed, variously explained5. One thing is clear. Whatever views may be held concerning Joseph, it can not but be agreed that he is atypical in his context. He is sui generis. He is young, a "puer patriarch". The God of the Fathers neither appears nor speaks to Joseph, and while his generation establish their Palestinian inheritance, he pursues a successful worldly career in Egypt as the Pharoah's alter ego6. So much is obvious, and more is obvious. If on the one hand Joseph is an atypical Hebrew patriarch, on the other hand he is shown to be highly typical of another nature. His reported attributes are those of the young "man-god", the disappearing and returning vegetation spirit; the beloved son of mother nature, the world's sacrifice to maintain its existence by renewal. Now this Joseph figure has two geographical connections. His life and his works and his death are in Egypt, but his mortal remains rest at Shechem in Palestine where his memory is venerated to the present day. This (which has been said before7) is to say a great deal of Joseph, and before proceeding it will be helpful to revise briefly the sources and basis of it all. Initially the issue may be sketched entirely from biblical reference. Joseph, the giver of increase (Gen. 30,24) was born of the Ewe of God who was a virgin, that is without issue from her husband after the flesh (29,31 ; 30,1). He was conceived by the spirit of God (30,22. 23), through the intermediary of a sacred plant of life, the mandrake (30,14-16). He grew up to be pre-eminent in physical beauty (39,6) but would not lightly offer up his potential, his abundance (39,7-12). He was a shepherd (37,2), and as a kid he 4 V. R.

He disappeared into the underworld (37,24) which in a manner was contiguous with Egypt (39,27ff.). In this region he was recognised as a saviour, giving life to many - conqueror of drouth, procurer of sustenance (41 ; 42). As such he rose again into the upper world so that it could be said of him that he was called out of Egypt. His blessings can be seen in the tree of life flourishing by the well containing life giving water (49,22) which are famous at Shechem (48,22). At this central point, the "navel of the land" his gift of divination was preserved in the sacred tree (Judg. 14,37) beneath or near which his relics which were brought from Egypt (Exod. 13,9) are buried (Josh. 24,32). This basic recital may be systemised as follows by the infusion of other evidence bearing on the issue - extra-biblical literature, comparative religion etc. A. The nature of Joseph is divine - the man-god, the young dying god Consider the following attributes - too marked and numerous for coincidence. The figure has two names, a Hebrew birth name and an Eyptian rebirth name. Although (as ever) the etymologies are disputed, the generally accepted renderings of both concur as descriptive of nature and function. In Hebrew "Joseph" (y/~ 'sp "gather, add, increase") signifies "he increases" or "the increaser"8. And when Pharoah gave Joseph an Egyptian name it was Zaphenath-paneah out of which the commentators can make "he procures the way of life", "he who gives the food of life" etc.9. The birth story of Joseph is a striking one - since out of the twelve it is the only occasion for the introduction of myth. It serves immediately to proclaim the nature of the figure. Rachel (the Ewe of God) without issue from her husband conceives immaculately of God (he gave her a child) by means of the mandrake - a plant of life and a renowned fertility charm10. Thus the nature of Joseph is straightway tied to the vegetal symbol of life and its renewal, on the exact analogy with the myrrh tree, almond or pomegranate branch which figured in the birth stories of Adonis and Atthis11. Joseph is typified in the tree of life - the great symbol which unites pneuma and hyl?. It is precisely as such that he is blessed by Jacob: "Joseph is a fruitful tree...". The other patriarchal blessing (of Moses) also introduces the same motif - "the one who dwells in the burning bush" (Deut. 33,16). The word used here is the thorn bush "sane" (sometimes held to give Sinai) and there were always those who saw this word in the name of Asenath, the wife provided for Joseph by Pharaoh (v. infra p. 102 f.). The world tree of life reappears in later legend. "Near Jacobs's house there grows a tree on which as often as a son is born, a new twig sprouts; at Joseph's birth no new twig is forthcoming; on Jacobs's prayer Gabriel brings from Paradise a twig which surpasses all others by blooming and bearing fruit."12 The essence of the myth of the young god who dies and is reborn in the tree, comports the two aspects of "total life" - death and rebirth: a a and a a? 13. 8 V.

Wright The aphanismos is the necessary sacrifice depicted almost inevitably by the a a 14. Joseph is consigned to the pit (h?r = the underworld) and is represented as a kid dismem bered by the evil beast (likewise the destroyer of Atthis and Adonis15) - "a kid of the goats as a sin offering". And this legend provided post-exilic Israel with the type of its Day of Atonement sacrifice16. The disappearance is mourned by mother nature: "At his vanishing away she lifts up lament... A weary woman ... forspent. Offspring of the house, my vanished one I sit wailing for thee."17 Lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted18. However, mysteriously there is release, a way up, a , is opened to a new life, a a? , a e e a which saves the world from sterility. "And they drew and lifted up Joseph from the pit." In all this can be recognised the force of the true ritual base of the myth. Equally apparent in the Joseph legend is the crudely anthropomorphic or "humanised" version of the myth. The most beautiful youth loved to excess by the mature mother - he is reluctant to sacrifice himself to her immoderate demands and she suffers in his loss. The physical beauty of the ephebic Joseph is stated in the biblical romance (Gen 39,6), but the theme is elaborated extravagantly in the legends which make Joseph a true Adonis. "Joseph is remarkable for his beauty which he has inherited from his mother Rachel. All the beauty in the world was originally granted to Adam, but when he sinned two thirds was taken from him and reserved for Joseph. According to others Joseph was possessed of nine tenths of all the beauty. Moses is dazzled by Joseph's beauty in paradise etc."19 The "Venus with young Adonis sitting by her" story is, of course, exactly represented in the romance by the misadventures with Potiphar's wife, where it has been noted a depoten tised Aqhat is wooed by a depotentised Anat20. And this episode assumed great prominence in Semitic literature and folk lore21. Bough, IV: Adonis, Attis, Osiris (London 31939); C.

That a Hebrew patriarch should be derived from an older god of Canaan is no novelty. It is an instance of a very basic theory which it is not in place to discuss here22. However, since this identification forms the foundation of further argument it may be noted that numbers of patriarchal names are identical with or very similar to those of Semitic deities e. g. Gad/Gad; Dan/Danel; Asher/Asherah or Ashur; Simeon/Simi, Simos; Zebulon/Baal Zebul etc. There are also Terahs and Labans in the heavenly roll call23. B. The divine Joseph is specifically Egyptian in character If the biblical Joseph Romance is a palimpsest revealing a primary figure in the nature of a dying god, then the fact that in the romance Joseph on reaching the years of discretion spends his entire life in Egypt and dies there suggests that the underlying divinity is an Egyptian divinity24. This is witnessed to by details in the biblical romance itself and is portrayed most expressionistically in the legends. However, in the first place it seems the fact is stated baldly in another biblical source - the blessings of Jacob. Although this is enclosed in the romance it is quite independent of it and is an old document. It consists of "dark sayings", oracular in tone and the passage referring to Joseph has always been considered corrupt. However, it is clear as previously stated that Joseph is identified with the Tree of Life. The authorised version translates "Joseph is a fruitful bough"(Gen. 49,22) which most of the commentators accept. The Hebrew text, however, gives literally "son fruitful" interpreted as "son of a fruitful (tree)" = fruitful bough, a possible circumlocution. In place of this the New English Bible proposes a bold and simple reading. It takes the bn not as the common noun son but as a proper name and translates "Joseph is a fruitful ben (tree)". Now this ben tree is the famous Egyptian tree of life growing in Heliopolis, an arch type of archtypal trees25. On this reading nothing could be more directly proclaimed than that the divine Joseph is of Egyptian origin. 22 V. e.g. G. Saintyves, Les saints successeurs des dieux (Paris 1907). 23 For recent general statements v. G. Fohrer, History of Israelitic Religion (London 1973), 164; Oesterly and Robinson, Hebrew Religion (London 1961), 126. Also in this instance H. May [fn. 7], 84. 24 H. May [fn. 7], 92 interprets the same situation differently. He finds the Egyptian career of Joseph part of a propaganda story invented by the levitical priesthood in Hebron to promote their interest the acceptance of Jahwism as a common religious background by the North as well as the South. 25 It is difficult to know how much Egyptological knowledge stands behind this bold reading, which is by no means outr?. Initially it must be observed that the Heliopolis tree, in the surviving records, is not referred to as the Ben tree, it is known as the 3lsd tree (v.,e.g., W. Helck, Ramessidische Inschriften aus Karnak, Z?S 82 (1957), [98-140] 127f. However it is the sacred tree in which nests the phoenix (the benu bird) in the house (sanctuary) of the obelisk, the benben stone and might very well be called the ben tree. Equally the common Egyptian word bnr.t for date palm (the tree of life) soon came to have this phonetic value, cf. Coptic Beni. V. Berliner W?rterbuch 1,462.1 am indebted to Dr. J. Osing for much kindness in discussing this question. On the other hand it may well be that the translators are adverting to the ben (ben hil?f or ban halaf) tree which is named in various Semitic languages. This name is used to designate several quite different trees - cf. the moringa, tamarisk, poplar euphratica (willow). Perhaps it is symptomatic that the name is associated with Tammuz in cuneiform literature. A biblical occurrence of this ben tree is Isaiah 49,4 where it is used as an image for the life of Israel (v. J. M. Allegro, A Possible Mesopotamian Background to the Joseph Blessing of Gen xlix, ZAW 64 [1952], 249-51 ; id., The Meaning of byn in Isaiah xliv. 4, ZAW 63 [1951], 154-56).</page><page sequence="6">100 G. R. H. Wright The biblical Joseph Romance is virtually the Romance of Joseph in Egypt or of the Egyptian Joseph. And it is interesting to observe that the Romance of Joseph in Egypt as it stands forms a complete version of the disappearing god myth - the beloved young god disappears into the underworld (the king's dungeon26) and returns to save men. Genesis 37 could thus be regarded as a duplication of Genesis 39 in the interests of historicising the material. On the other hand if Gen. 37 is added to the story then there is rather an idiosyncratic result. The myth comports two disappearances, two descents ad injeros (the pit at Dothan and the Nilotic dungeon); it involves a "second death". Now a figure contained in a tree who disappears into the bonds of death first in Syria and secondly by the Nile (where none the less he is a ruler) and yet revives to be the saviour of men is not far to seek. And all the extra-biblical legends (Jewish, Christian and Moslem) portray a Joseph with marked Osirid characteristics27. It is noteworthy that the occasion for the attempted seduction of Joseph was reckoned to be the thanksgiving for the rise of the Nile28. This detail, moreover, affords an interesting connection with another body of legend. Special veneration was shown by the Copts for Joseph of the Holy Family29, who was invested with the character and attributes of the patriarch Joseph - e.g. he is a exactly as the patriarch Joseph is es-s?d?q. And this second Joseph (the avatar of Joseph the patriarch) is certainly identified with Osiris. His feast day is 26th Epep, again the old feast of the rise of the Nile. Furthermore, his story, the Coptic Story of Joseph the Carpenter30, is in fact almost entirely the story of his death. Thus he is represented as a dying god so that "man darf sagen, er ist nichts oder er wird ein Osiris"31 - an astonishing identification unless the Old Testament figure of Joseph reveals itself by its attributes to possess the nature of an Egyptian deity. The biblical romance ends with Joseph's death in Egypt - "So Joseph died ... and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt" (Gen. 50,26). Thereafter the legends deal with the dead Joseph entirely as Osiris. The various Egyptian nomes disputed the possession of Joseph's remains and the benefits of increase his interment in their region would bring. The coffined body was in fact cast into the waters of the Nile32 (i. e. "made an Osiris") so that his power should compel high inundations ensuring even distribution of fertility over the whole land. Furthermore, the body came to be positioned exactly in midstream so that neither bank should be differentially favoured. 26 Much ingenuity has been devoted to the explication of this image with reference to the two ritualistic supporters, the good and bad thief; the harrowing of hell; ruling among the dead etc. V.

"The Shepherd is in the water with the fish."</page><page sequence="7">An Egyptian God at Shechem 101 In due course when the days of the oppression came men realised that it was only Joseph who could deliver Israel. There was an agonised searching and eventually a wise woman Sarach bath Asher (v. Num. 26,46 - cf. Asherah, the tree surrogate) was able to locate the casket in the Nile33 and in answer to prayers it rose to the surface and with it and by it Israel was brought out of Egypt. It was in the name of Joseph under his sign and through his power exemplified in the embalmed remains in the coffin that the exodus was effected. "Es l??t sich denn auch zeigen, da? die ganze Josephsgeschichte im Grund nichts anderes ist als der Osirismythus"34. Finally there is a singular fact which must be considered in this context. Whether or not the biblical figure of Joseph had its origins in an old Egyptian god, men certainly saw the origin of a new Egyptian god in the biblical figure of Joseph. Later antiquity (cf. the Christian apologists and church fathers) was quite convinced that Joseph was the original Serapis (Osiris-Apis). Melito of Sardis, Tertullian, Firmicus Maternus, Rufinus, Paulinus of Nola all testified to this effect35. C. The biblical Joseph is connected with Shechem not in life but in death and after life "Over and above the regular division of the patrimony I give you one shoulder (lot) = eminent portion = Shechem City" (Gen. 48,22)36. In these words of Jacob (inserted into the Joseph Romance) the biblical record testifies to the connection of Joseph with Shechem, legitimising the occupation of the region by the house of Joseph - the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. Next Jacob in his benediction characterises Joseph as "a fruitful ben tree, a tree of life by a well of living water whose foliage runs over/overhangs the (Sanctuary?) wall" (Gen. 49,22). This tree and well being the landmarks of Shechem throughout history. These two verses, both venerable traditions, unmistakably indicate an intention to settle Joseph at Shechem. However, Joseph was never seized of his hereditament. He died and his embalmed remains were put into a coffin in Egypt (Gen. 50,26). Nonetheless the inheritance passed to the children of Joseph. As token of possession "the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the son of Hamor" (Josh. 24,32). And this tomb (beneath the tree) has always been and still is pointed out at Shechem37. In short we are offered a tribal ancestor who never lived at Shechem but whose remains were brought from afar and buried there. However, Joseph's biblical connections with Shechem are not entirely post mortem. If there is no personal record of Joseph dwelling at Shechem he is stated once in person to have passed by or before the town. This exceptional episode has been described by the commentators as one of the most puzzling of the whole romance38. It is, of course, most revealing. In fact it is in this world but not of it, it transcends 33 V. The Jewish Encyclopedia, VII (New York 1904), 246 ff. 34 V. D.

It is the episode of the Man of Shechem who guides Joseph when he is sent to observe and serve the welfare of his kind. Here the Hebrew Joseph of story (the youthful victim) meets his own image "that image sole of men he saw" - the psychopomp which leads every man to his destiny. Coming along the way from Judaea which threads the Vale of Shechem Joseph approaches the city to stand before the East Gate, where is the Sanctuary Area39. "And a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him saying who seekest thou?" In biblical terms such a meeting with an unknown, unqualified man imports a theophany. That is to say, the man of Shechem who directs Joseph on his way is God or a god. He is the God of the Shechem Sanctuary whereto the story-tale Joseph has come. This is a manifest symbol of individuation. The man of Shechem, the God of the Shechem Sanctuary whom Joseph met is that god who dwells within the heart - the self. The Hebrew youth Joseph is proclaimed God of the Shechem Sanctuary. Another connection which may serve to link the patriarch Joseph with the cult of the Shechem Sanctuary is a truly strange one, extravagantly embodied in legend. It refers to the patriarch's wife and has the trappings of a hellenistic romance - a plot of the new comedy. "Pharoah gave Joseph to wife Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On" (Gen. 41,45). An attempt has been made to find an Egyptian etymology for the name, "belonging to Neith", but this has not carried much conviction40. For some reason ignored in the biblical record the figure of Asenath assumed great significance for later Jewry. Among other things she became a type for conversion to Judaism and a very influential apocryphal tract was composed (by Essenes?) called "The Prayer of Asenath"41. In any event the "historical" extravaganza of Asenath runs as follows42. Asenath was by origin not Egyptian; her birth and her nativity were of the Land of Canaan. She was the illegitimate daughter of Dinah through her violation by Shechem the son of Hamor (Gen. 34). She was exposed with an identifying pendant about her neck and by various interven tions (Michael, an eagle, etc.) the unwanted infant was deposited in Egypt so that she was discovered by the high priest of On and adopted as his daughter. Thus Joseph married his niece and, be it noted, acquired for his house a good title to rule in Shechem by his marriage to the aboriginal heiress. Thus beneath the romantic trappings of a later age may be recognised a very practical local tradition. In view of this, one detail is of considerable importance in the present connection. The infant was exposed under a thorn bush and hence was called Asenath as derived from son?, the thorn bush43. Asenath thus was the thorn bush, and by this meaningful name proclaimed the burning bush of Sinai. She was the hylatic principle of the tree which bears spiritual fruit. O moder mayde. O mayde moder free O bush unbrennt burning in Moyses sighte. Du aber bist der Baum. 39 V. J. A.

The foregoing analysis may be recapitulated briefly as follows: a) From the biblical romance of Joseph (set against comparitive religious data) the nature of the Joseph figure is revealed as that of the young dying god. b) In the Joseph romance and extravagantly so in Semitic legend the divine exemplar of the Joseph figure is evidenced as Egyptian. c) From the brief constrained biblical reference supported by local tradition, the connec tion of the Joseph figure with Shechem is revealed to be not in life, but in death and thereafter. The import of these observations is that the patriarch Joseph is derived from the divinity of the Shechem sanctuary, whose cult was established (or renovated) there by relics brought from Egypt. Since both the divine character as presented in the legends together with the concept of establishing a cult centre about mortal remains relate specifically to Osiris, we may further say that the old Shechem cult was in origin Osiriform - i.e. that the hero ancestor later venerated at Shechem was originally a form of the Egyptian god. That is to say in brief, the patriarch Joseph was not an Israelite hero who became Egyptianised, but an Egyptian divinity who was Hebra?sed44. III To assert that the Hebrew patriarch Joseph bears in his person the lineaments of his ancestors (as all figures do), that he reproduces in himself his family history, is to assert nothing new. So much, in fact, has been said before often enough. But can this track into the past be further followed? Can, indeed, it be approached from the other end. Can Egyptol ogy afford any indication of the emigrant divinity? Perhaps, but the considerations involved are straws in a wind of long ago, they are names and what is in a name? An ancient centre of the Osiris cult in Egypt was Letopolis45, the modern Aus?m situated on the west bank of the Nile about 11 km north of Cairo at the very apex of the Delta. This religious centre can be brought into relation with the legendary figure buried at Shechem in a number of instances. However, before entering into these details it is well to give brief consideration to the underlying issue - viz. that religious connections can be reasonably supposed to have existed between Egypt and a particular town in Central Palestine at a period somewhere about the middle of the second millenium B.C. As is common knowledge Egyptian divinities did not constitute themselves an entirely enclosed community eschewing all foreign relations46. They ventured abroad (Isis), inter 44 Cf. D. V?lter, Die Patriarchen Israels [fn. 34], 84: "Die Erz?hlung aber, da? die Lade mit dem Leichnam Josephs, nachdem sie lange in Aegypten geblieben war, beim Auszug von den Israeliten mitgenommen und nach Pal?stina gebracht worden sei, kann kaum etwas anderes bedeuten, als da? der Cultus eines toten in einer Lade liegenden Gottes, der eigentlich in Aegypten zu Hause war, von den Israeliten ?bernommen worden ist. Dieser Gott ist Osiris." 45 V. PREXII/2,2146f. 46 V. Art. ?gyptische G?tter im Ausland, in: Lexikon der ?gyptologie II (Wiesbaden 1977), 630-632.</page><page sequence="10">104 G. R. H. Wright married with non-Egyptians (Set, etc.), maintained foreign dwellings (Hathor), and even became as it were expatriates - there is a possible reference to a form of Osiris who dwelt in Mt. Lebanon. Now it is precisely with the Syro-Palestinian area that Egyptian religion shows these interconnections47, and within this region the town and district of Shechem were well known to the Egyptians48. This goes back to the Middle Kingdom when an official recorded in Abydos his participation in a campaign of Senusert III. (1880-1840 B.C.) during which Shechem fell49. The town also figures in the Execration Texts50. That this place or the name should have been of note to any educated Egyptian is made clear in the Anastasi Papyrus where a question is asked to expose the ignorance of a scribe: "Where does the mountain of Shechem come?"51 Furthermore in addition to the appearance of $akmiy Skmm, Skm which obviously are the equivalent of the Hebrew Shechem, probably in the form of a dual, there is also an Egyptian record of a place name Joseph-el in a list of the time of Thothmes III. This item has been much disputed in reading and in geographical positioning52, but it has been accepted by competent authority as referring to a locality at or in the vicinity of Shechem53. At least there is no conclusive evidence disassociating it from this obvious interpretation. All this is to say that from the Middle Kingdom onwards the Egyptians were familiar with the town in Palestine which they knew by the local name and also by 1400 B.C. they knew of a locality with the theophoric name Joseph-el which could have been an alternative name for Shechem or a name for an associated establishment or aspect of the city - cf. Shechem and Migdol Shechem (Jdg. 9,41-49). Later in the Amarna age Shechem, of course, figured prominently in Egyptian policy (or lack of it)54. There is thus nothing improbable that an Egyptian cult should have been established at the Palestinian Shechem - perhaps in connec tion with an Egyptian post or garrison. What then are the indications that this cult might have proceeded from or been influenced by the religious centre at .Assira-Letopolis? There is first the name, always a matter of significance for Egyptians with whom punning was holy. The Letopolis of the Greeks (v. Strabo XVIII, 1, 35), capital of the Letopolites nome (the 2nd of lower Egypt) was perhaps originally called Khem in Egyptian which was also the common noun for sanctuary, thus the town of Letopolis may have originally been "The Sanctuary". However, because of linguistic accidents the pronunciation changed. As written with an initial "fossil belemnites" (Gardiner, R. 22) it was affected in Middle Kingdom times by the common substitution of the door bolt S (R 34) for the former sign (R 22) and thus the town (and the word for sanctuary, etc.) came to be pronounced Sekhem. This gave Coptic (Bus?m), and in turn Auslm in Arabic55. 47 V. R.

H.</page><page sequence="11">An Egyptian God at Shechem 105 That is at the latest by New Kingdom times both the Egyptian religious centre and the Palestinian town were referred to by virtually the same name - thus they could be thought of in some sense as equivalents. And this coincidence could well predispose the extension of a famous cult from the metropolis to the foreign city - and the application of "cultural drift" theory. If there were similarities in the names of the two towns, there were more arresting similarities in their nature - that is with respect to religion. Both the sites were renowned sanctuaries and in a sense they were central sanctuaries. The Palestinian town being virtually central between Dan and Beersheba, while the Egyptian town is situated exactly where the Nile valley gives over to the spread of the Delta. It is figuratively at the shoulders of Egypt, as the Palestinian Shechem means literally shoulder (or probably originally, shoulders - the two mountains Ebal and Gerizim). Now the primitive god of Letopolis/Sekhem, Kherty56 was assimilated into the Osiris cycle by the time of the Pyramid Texts as "Horus, avenger of his father", and an important corporeal relic of Osiris was assigned to Sekhem. It was the shoulder (blade) of Osiris57. "I am with Horus who acteth as the guardian of the shoulder of Osiris in Sekhem."58 Perhaps it was the topographical position of Sekhem which dictated the choice of the appropriate Osirid relic. In any event presence of the shoulder at Sekhem/Letopolis formed another association with the Palestinian sanctuary Shechem "The Shoulder". Nor was there lacking an association in the cult aspect of the two sanctuaries. Both were pre-eminent "places at the centre" where the vertical axis provided means of communication between the superimposed spheres of existence. This is a matter of common knowledge as relating to Shechem, "the navel of the land"59. However, similar considerations appear in the records of Letopolis. There was a famous "night of Sekhem" of oecumenical significance in the religious life of Ancient Egypt, a night of power when the manifest forces of evil or disorder (the demons) were slain60. "The night of making to stand up the double djed in Sekhem.. ."61 Now "the night of making the Djed column (the spinal column of Osiris - the world column) to stand up ... signifieth the lifting up of the arm and shoulder by Horus who dwelleth in Sekhem"62. Even more notably Letopolis was the place where a ladder was raised so that the justified could ascend through "the Gates of Heaven" which belong to Letopolis. "The Gates which are in Sekhem are opened to me."63 "The four grandsons (offspring of Horus) of Letopolis ... they bind a ladder for ... They make firm a ladder for N, they cause to ascend (to the sky)."64 This setting up of the ladder and ascent through the gates which are in Sekhem mentions the circumpolar stars and Gauthier, Dictionnaire des Noms G?ographiques, V (Cairo 1928), 45; Berliner W?rterbuch, III, 280; Sir A.

(Letopoiis was a great centre of astronomical observation in Ancient Egypt.) By these tokens it is possible to recognise the Egyptian Sekhem as an "axial" religious centre and thus after the same essence as the Sanctuary at the Palestinian Shechem. There remains one further point to be mentioned which introduces Letopoiis into the story of the Exodus. Josephus preserves an account of the sojourn in Egypt and the Exodus derived in part from Manetho equating the phenomena with the episode of the Hyksos domination of and their subsequent expulsion from Egypt66. Although clearly the city of Letopoiis meant nothing to him, Josephus affords it a very significant mention in his account of the Exodus, making it so to speak the point of departure for the host67. Now since this on the face of it is a geographical absurdity (involving crossing the Nile in the wrong direction) it must be based on some tradition. Could the tradition refer in some way to the suggested religious connection between Letopoiis and Shechem - the expedition to Palestine of an embalmed relic which subsequently entered the biblical record (and Jewish legend) as the wonder-working sarcophagus of Joseph which the host brought (or which brought the host) to Palestine and was deposited at Shechem. IV To a sacred chest with some such origins it has often been held that the Bible affords a semi-historical postscript. When we think of an ornamented casket wherein is the real presence of God which is carried along by the host of Israel as a palladium to ensure their preservation and success. Then it is not only the Egyptian sarcophagus of Joseph which comes to mind - indeed it is not principally the sarcophagus of Joseph which comes to mind. The ark was fashioned in the form of a chest or container ('?r?n, latin area &gt; arcere = to keep, cf. arcana) richly ornamented with winged figures, etc. (Ex. 25,1 Off.). It is now understood as an "object" of a cult with a highly developed iconography and hence a cult alien to the wilderness. Thus the passages in Exodus (25 &amp; 37) and Deuteronomy (10) detailing its construction in the wilderness of Sinai are held late anachronistic insertions68. The ark then first appears in the biblical record in the period immediately prior to the monarchy as a portable cult object signalling the presence of god, kept variously at different sanctuaries in central Palestine (Shiloh, etc.) in the tribal district of Ephraim69. It is employed as a palladium in the conflict with the Philistines70 and great importance is attached to it at the establishment of the monarchy71. Since the original provenance of the ark is in the house of Joseph, and since it is called the ark of God ??r?n *?l?h?my '?r?n '?l?h?yisr?'?l) or the ark of the covenant of God which could 65 V. E.

'?l?h?m yisra?, 3? bdr?t the covenant God, and the place where the covenant of God was ritually rehearsed so constituting a political centre of assembly for all Israel. This notwith standing, the inescapable fact that the Bible nowhere convincingly states the ark to have been lodged at or to have come from Shechem. Josh. 8,33 is reckoned a Deuteronomic inser tion. Moreover, since the ark is described as basically a chest or container, and various details of its construction and ornament indicate Egyptian design for mortuary purposes, the ark has been identified as Joseph's Egyptian coffin73 in which the patriarch was brought from Egypt to be buried at Shechem. Now a frangible object (of Shittim wood) subject to vicissitudes of rough handling and exposure, to asportation, conversion and long delayed recovery probably owes its continued existence to the world of ideas (cf. the holy cross, etc.). However, behind its various material incarnations, the prototype of the ark, the palladium of the house of Joseph, the casket of Egyptian design74 might well have been the reliquary75 which once contained the mortal part of the dying god Joseph76, the increasor, God of the Shechem Sanctuary. V The considerations assembled above demonstrate in themselves a measure of coherence suggesting some truth in their order, what correspondence may be alleged with the general sequence of events with which they are involved? Shechem was founded as a city (or city state) in the Middle Bronze Age77 and immediately appears in the Egyptian records. Sometime in the Bronze Age under the strong influence of Middle or New Kingdom rule a cult was established (or renovated) at Shechem based on a corporeal relic (an embalmed shoulder?) brought from Egypt, perhaps from the religious centre of Letopolis, the famous sanctuary, The Sanctuary - Sekhem, at the shoulders of Egypt where was venerated the shoulder of the dismembered Osiris. This deity was known or came to be known as Joseph (or some such kindred form) probably derived from the root "to increase". In conformity with the well attested syncretising, universalising tendency this 72 V. G. Fohrer, History of Israelite Religion (London 1975); 91 ; R. Hartmann, Zelt und Lade [fn. 68], 212 ff. 73 V.

It should also be noted that there were various coffers and receptacles for the viscera and other parts extracted in the better type of mummification. These ornamented "Canopic Chests" by nature must have been similar to any Osirid reliquary and could also be looked to in connection with the ark. V. (for convenience) Moret, Plate XXI: 2. 76 Cf. H.

Wright god came to be reckoned a form of El and was referred to as Joseph-el, affording an additional or alternative place name (for the Sanctuary). Some Hebrew groups frequented the Shechem area and it was possibly under their influence or with their concurrence that the designation Joseph-el (Elohim Israel) was developed. Eventually in the transitional Bronze/Iron Age a specific Hebrew confederation established themselves as holders of central Palestine with Shechem as a ritual centre for their covenant. Perhaps again with a measure of Hebrew influence the deity Joseph-el developed into the God of the covenant Joseph-El Berith. Alternatively the older deity was replaced by a covenant god, El Berith. (In time the semi-otiose El component was encroached on by the younger puissant Baal to give a rival form Baal Berith.) In any event the original local deity, Joseph, was ousted or lapsed form divine status to subsist in local legend, a local hero, a wise soothsayer who had originally wrought wonders in Egypt78. After the lapse of a century or two the legend was made the basis of a pseudo-historical document providing a heroic ancestor, a "patriarchfor the Hebrew tribes established in Central Palestine with a covenant renewed at Shechem, who now designated themselves as the House of Joseph. The several versions of this document were edited and incorporated into the Hexateuch as the Joseph Romance (Gen. 37,39-48,50) in the form we know in circumstances which it is the business of critical enquiry to eludidate79. Meanwhile, the legend of this so numenous figure flourished to become a widely known folk tale and was continually being historicised, in conjunction with or under the influence of the Genesis chapters. This provided an extensive Rabbinic literature and eventually Sura XII (of Yusef - or The Beautiful) together with other Islamic literature. Finally in modern times this whole body of literature was drawn on (in conjunction with considerable scholarship) to produce an epic romance reintegrating the total resources of the legend in which all its symbols have been rendered explicit on the psychological plane. It can be seen readily that this suggested historical mise-en-sc?ne follows a general pattern - a type sequence. Another example of the same sequence which is exactly contemporary may be of some interest. The various Kouroi (and korai) of the Mycenaean cities (Theseus, Agamemnon, Helen, etc.) were divine figures worshipped at the sanctuaries of their respective cities until the upheavals which brought the Bronze Age civilisation to an end. Then the majority lost their status as deities, but survived in local legend to become heroic ancestors, kingly heroes of the vanished age80. In turn these legends were drawn on and worked over to form the personae and plots of an oecumenical literature - epic and classical drama81. Equally, the legends survived in various forms at various levels of strength and sophistication. And when a later, critical age became interested in such things they were recorded, discussed and explained by such scholarly writers as Diodoros, Plutarch, Pausanius, Macrobius, etc. Parallel with their descent into literature, the legendary heroes served to exalt men in another fashion. They were appropriated as ancestors and thus regained a measure of 78 Cf. E. MacLaurin, Joseph and Asaph, VT 25 (1975), 27-45. 79 Cf. S. Hooke [fn. 6], 203. 80 V. M. P.

It is, furthermore, a subject bound up with almost every aspect of anthropology, social and cultural. However, since the putative god of the Shechem Sanctuary figures as a Hebrew ancestor, it is instructive to give an illustration of the choice of ancestors in the analogous Greek cycle. The old Athenian socio-political organisation was based on some reasonable consonance between consanguinity and neighbourhood. Cleisthenes reformed the system in 510 B.C. with a political objective of clipping the wings of the landed families. He devised a new system of tribes and these had to be provided with eponymous ancestors. How was this effected : how did this tribe become Aegeis (of Aegeus), that Erechtheis (of Erechtheus)? The tribesmen "elected" a panel of names and the Delphic priestess selected the appropriate ancestor from the panel83. Finally, it may be pointed out that the development indicated is not restricted to the ancient age under discussion. A comparable cycle within Western Civilisation is the follow ing. Celtic myth and ritual was the expression of a living religion in the early part of the first millenium of our era. There ensued several hundred years (half a millenium) during which this religion was superseded and its mythology was transformed into local legends and folk tales about strong men and magicians, etc. Then in the high middle ages (ca. 1000-1250 A.D.) these legends were given literary form to become the numerous sagas which formed the ethos of Western Chivalry (The Round Table, The Grail romances, etc.)84. Such is the cycle of religion, literature, history where appears evidence for the cult of an Egyptian god at Bronze Age Shechem. 82 On ancestor worship among the fathers and in later Israel v.
