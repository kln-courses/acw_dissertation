<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRANCUSI'S CARYATID II IN I968 the generosity of Mrs. Max Wasserman, William A. Coolidge, and Joseph Hazen enabled the Fogg Museum to ac- quire Caryatid II by Brancusi (figure i).1 Carved in inis, it stands almost five and a half feet high. Brancusi's point of departure was a horizontal slab of red oak which had already served as the base of another sculpture and had probably been given much its present form.2 To this he dowelled i. The acquisition also involved contributions from the Museum's Francis H. Burr and Alpheus Hyatt Funds. There are no indications of recutting visible either to the naked eye or under ultra-violet light. Caryatid II is made of four pieces of red oak, in their entirety 655/8 X I7 X i8 in. The history of the piece is simple, de- ceptively simple perhaps. It was acquired from the artist by John Quinn in I9I6. From his collection it passed to Henri Roche (Aline B. Saarinen, The Proud Posses- sors, NewYork, I958,p. 236). In I959 it was bought from the Roche collection by the Staempfli Gallery, New York, which sold it to the Fogg in I968. It was ex- hibited at the Brummer Galleries in I926 and I933, at the Guggenheim Museum in I955, and subsequently elsewhere.

That the plinth was always a base is suggested by the relatively rough bottom surface and the countersinking of four 5/8 in. holes that have been drilled through this block. Since these holes seem to have been planned together and two of them bear no relation to the present piece, they were presumably designed for some other use. Arthur Beale, among many helpful observations, has suggested that it was the use of the two outer holes to carry a sculpture which at some time caused the block to split. These outer holes were plugged with paper and the split halves rejoined with glue. He has theorized that the two center holes (now visible be- tween the feet of the caryatid on the top of the plinth) were made in solid wood to replace the ones plugged. The uniform gray-green stained finish of the plinth 2I</page><page sequence="2">i. Caryatid II from the front and glued a vertical piece of oak, staining it grayish-green at the bottom to match the reused base, but gradually modulating the finish to a dull red. The two upper elements, likewise of oak and stained red, are held in place by dowels, but can easily be separated from each other and removed from the trunk. The distinctive pattern of the grain proves that the base or plinth and the top piece or abacus were cut from the same old beam. This suggests that the whole figure was conceived in its present form at the start, likewise suggests a different use. Had it been extensively recut when adapted to Caryatid II, presumably it would have been refinished in red to match the red stain of the rest of the statue. Geist, op. cit., p. i65 states "a photograph shows Caryatid no. go not quite completed and marked in chalk by the sculptor." I re- gret I have not seen this photograph. 22</page><page sequence="3">a hypothesis which is strengthened by other structural details.3 The art dealer Joseph Brummer illustrated the top portion of the work as it is now in the catalogue be prepared for the important exhibition of Brancusi's sculpture he held in New York in I926 (figure 2).4 On the other hand a photograph of the galleries dur- 3. The dowel holes run right through the headdress, suggesting that this piece was designed in conjunction with the abacus. However, Marielle de Lavilleon has recently discovered a glass negative showing Caryatid II in its entirety before it had been completed. The figure was then some two feet taller than at present. The legs continued separately downward below the present ankles which were perhaps understood as knees. They curved together at the bottom and the whole stood on a simple rectangular plinth. Time did not permit full study and detailed interpre- tation of this unpublished photograph. 4. "Brancusi, Exhibition November i7-December I5, 1926, The Brummer Gallery I2 East s7th St. New York."

Caryatid II was not meant to be more than quasi freestanding. In back, the upper portion of the trunk is disfigured by a long irregular indentation, dug out with the gouge that shaped the horizontal grooves at the neck (figure 3).7 This indentation must reflect some change in the artist's intention.8 The back could be left thus unfinished only, one assumes, because it was not meant to be seen. During his first years as an art student, Brancusi, we are told, "excelled in woodworking,"9 although by the time he was on his own he seems to have abandoned the medium. He began his career as an independent sculptor by modelling. All the early works we know anything about were in clay, plaster, or bronze. Apparently he did not take up direct carving again for about a decade. His first stone figure was cut in I907, and this led to a com- 5. This unpublished photograph, from Brancusi's own files, is preserved in the Musee Nationale de l'Art Moderne, Paris. The shot must have been taken before the exhibition was quite ready for opening, but there is no reason to doubt that this is how Caryatid II was displayed. 6.

The hole in the top of the abacus suggests that even the complete Caryatid may at some time have carried another small sculpture. 7. Illustrated in Geist, p. I98. 8. When Brancusi plugged a diagonal hole at the back, he started to drill an- other hole of the same dimensions as the plug, and exactly parallel to it. The two clearly suggest eyes. The indentation forms a rough nose between. This project was abandoned. Nonetheless it was the botched back of the statue which Brum- mer displayed (Ezra Pound, Op. Cit., pI. 27). One wonders why. 9.

During the five immediately preceding years he had been all-but- exclusively concerned with small objects, exquisitely worked in bronze, marble, or alabaster. From their high polish he now turned with enthusiasm to the pitted and chipped and stained sur- faces of second-hand oak beams. Brancusi's return to the use of wood was bound up with a sec- ond major change in his style. This took place more gradually io. Ibid., p. 2I6, nos. 34, 38, and 39, all of I907. i i. Ibid., pp. 44 and 220, no. 75. 25</page><page sequence="6">than the earlier transformation, but in the end it was equally pro- found. By the late teens the use of wood had led Brancusi into designing furniture and other useful objects and into experiments with architectural forms. Immediately the use of wood was ac- companied by a renewed interest in monumentality. Most sig- nificant of all, perhaps, only then did Brancusi begin to find inspi- ration in works of art other than those which were being produced around him. About this time Rumanian peasant carving, an art he must have known intimately since childhood, began overtly to influence his own work. Since he believed that "only the Africans and Ru- manians know how to carve wood," it is not surprising that African sculpture inspired him to make Caryatid I, in I9I 5, an oak figure seven and a half feet tall (figure 4).12 Caryatid II, a second version, was produced the same year. The forms are substantially idential but the proportions have been altered. The Fogg's piece is smaller and more elaborate while several parts of the trunk have been shaved flat. Moreover, the sculptor has added both a plinth and an abacus. By a lucky chance we know something about the way Brancusi made such changes. Figure 2 reproduces a photograph probably taken by the sculptor himself that shows the top of Caryatid I be- fore it was completed. Caryatid II must have begun in a form quite close to Caryatid L The body, for example, was originally round. The "earring" was flat and rose in a simple diagonal all the way to the back of the head. Brancusi evidently thought of his statue in terms of clearly defined planes at right angles to one another, like the elevations of a building. When he decided on a change he would cut back one face of the statue the desired amount. Then he would draw in chalk on the new surface the limits to which the adjacent surface should be cut back. One can see clearly how this process worked at the "necklace." At the time this photograph was taken the sculptor had already reduced the front of the torso I2.

Mates) to a plane, but the side had not perhaps been shaved quite flat. Evi- dently he had not made up his mind how he wanted to treat it. In fact, none of the confused chalk lines under the "earring" bear any relation to the form he finally chose. More important are the differences at the headdress. This is al- ready smaller than the one on Caryatid I and continuous with the head on every face. That this continuity was important to Bran- cusi is proved by the pattern of circles which he has worked out in chalk on both front and side of the contiguous blocks. This motif, taken over perhaps from the earlier Kiss and taken up again ulti- mately in the later Kiss Columns, was never executed here. Bran- 27</page><page sequence="8">cusi also abandoned the cutting of the lower portion of the abacus into a series of saw teeth. But these inspired the form finally given to the "earrings. More difficult to answer is the question why Brancusi intro- duced these changes. Caryatid II is the last of a short series of rela- tively large wooden figures. As was usual in Brancusi's work, the later objects in the series are elaborated and receive more and more decoration. Indeed, Caryatid II is one of the most elaborated and decorated pieces he ever produced. To study it is to find endless delight in the virtuosity with which the sculptor plays one form against another: the neat grooves at the neck opposed to the rub- bery ripples of the hair down the back, the arc of the heel answered by the arc of the toe, the half-cylinders of the ankles repeating the half-cylinders of the plinth. Eveen so does Bach echo, transpose, or invert a musical motif. Equally characteristic of Brancusi's method of working and far more important, the later objects in this series become less and less anthropomorphic. In the case of Caryatid II, this involved a marked change in proportions. The group had started with The First Step of 1913, a simple statement of the static problems of a walking figure. Caryatid I by adding a "headdress" block introduced the problem of external weight which had to be supported by the fig- ure. This concern is greatly developed in Caryatid II, with its con- scious opposition between the inert forms of plinth, headdress, and abacus, and the organic forms of the torso. Both elaboration and decoration serve in their different ways to intensify the drama of forces. The curved elements at the bottom are tense and resilient like a nest of coiled springs. The pendant earrings and hair carry the sense of oppressive weight all down the torso.13 But the change from Caryatid I to Caryatid II is more marked than perhaps might have been expected between two successive studies of the same problem. This is because the later piece also in- I3. The curved forms are integral, and at the base; the pendant forms merely il- lustrative, and at the top. This distinction was already made in The First Step, the start of the series. 28</page><page sequence="9">corporates conclusions derived from another series of sculptures. This unpublished and unnamed group of monumental wooden figures may be christened the cat caryatids, since it is likely that they were inspired by certain Egyptian cats in the Louvre.14 What seems to have been the earliest of Brancusi's cats stood some four feet high and is known only from a photograph of his studio.15 This shows a conventionalized but recognizable head with two dowel holes for eyes, a chest swelling both forwards and sideways, a pair of legs and the curved tip of a tail. Next come an almost identical pair which still exist, back to back, in the Musee Nationale de l'Art Moderne (figure 5). In front they have been flattened and simplified, and each was cut out in a notch behind the body. At the back of each head is a deep slot. The latter feature suggests that this pair of cats may once have been heraldically side by side with a heavy plank running through the slot so that together they formed, if not a balustrade, at least a barrier. Be that as it may, at some point Brancusi turned them back to back and joined them together by a common headdress block which supported an abacus projecting slightly on all sides. Dowels must have projected down- wards into holes in the tops of the cats' heads. Thus they appear in an unpublished photograph probably of the early 1920'S. Later this double crown was replaced by the architrave which the cats now carry. This is almost square in section. The final pair of cats were certainly smaller and probably more elaborate. Their form and history is wholly unknown. All one can say is that they must have been briefly united back to back by a I4. The collections include bronze seated cats of the familiar type, a number of which are now on display. Some of these wear a brooch, and this presumably in- spired the large round pellet on the chest of Brancusi's cats. The Louvre also now displays a wooden mummy case for a cat. The outside represents the animal seated in the usual way. With its squat proportions and comparatively large head this is far closer to Brancusi's cats, but this piece does not wear a brooch. i5. This unpublished photograph is in the Muse'e National de l'Art Moderne in Paris as is the one mentioned later in this paragraph. Since there is some talk of publishing a group of Brancusi's photographs none of this material is included in this article. 29</page><page sequence="10">S. Cat Caryatids II and III, courtesy of the Musee Nationale de 1'Art Moderne, Paris common plinth. It is this plinth which was re-used for CaryatidjI.16 This series of cats not only provided the Fogg's statue with the idea of a plinth but with its actual substance. They also suggested a headdress exactly fitting the head and an abacus projecting be- yond it. In short they are the fundamental source of the concept of an organic support between inert base and inert load. From Carya- tid I Brancusi developed the specific forms of the torso. But compared to all these preceding works Caryatid II is an al- i6. I know of no way of dating the cats except by style. I would guess the series started after The First Step of I9I2 or 1913. It must have been completed before Caryatid II was carved in i9iS. 30</page><page sequence="11">most architectonic statement of the problem of weight and sup- port. Almost, yet not quite, for the supporting torso still conveys an impression of organic rather than of mechanical resistance. Looked at independently of Brancusi's other sculpture, one might not think of it as representing a human figure. The impressionistic analogy would be to some different living form, to some rampant cobra, for instance, or even to some portion of the human body, perhaps a forearm, wrist, and fist thrusting upwards. But what- ever the interpretation, Caryatid II would seem, as it is, a support and therefore an excerpt from some larger whole. As such it con- trasts conceptually with the preceding small, highly polished works. These, by their purity of form and perfection of surface, stood out against a corrupted world but equally could not partici- pate in anything greater than themselves. Yet all this experimentation with monumental figures proved for Brancusi a dead end.17 In fact, after Caryatid II, he rejected the whole western tradition of the life-sized statue as this had existed since the end of the eighteenth century. Instead, approximating a different western tradition his work followed two divergent but complementary paths.18 Romanesque sculptors, for example, had created such architectonic complexes as their cloisters or church portals. Simultaneously they created small, perfect, idol-like ma- I7. Caryatid II is not quite the end of the story. Two unpublished photographs of Brancusi's studio made sometime after i9i5 show a short oak pier. On the edge Brancusi had sketched in chalk the outline of the trunk of a short caryatid. Body and head curve forward violently. The drawings are hard to interpret and nothing is known of the object, if it was ever carved. Both the Cats and the Caryatids pro- vided prototypes from which Brancusi developed bases. A cat-inspired base ap- pears in the installation photographs of the 1933 Brummer show carrying the Negresse Blanche. A caryatid-inspired base is known in photographs in the Art Moderne. It consisted of two pieces that one imagines might together be some three feet high. The lower piece had two quarter cylinders separated by a scalloped neck. The upper reproduces the forms of the abacus of Caryatid II. Both these bases are wholly abstract and seem slightly mechanical. i8. Bound as we all are to the tradition that sculpture is equivalent to statuary, Brancusi's achievement has been approached almost exclusively in terms of his busts and figures. His bases, chairs, cups, and portals have been considered pleasant doodling and almost entirely ignored. Yet by any objective standard-consider- ing, for example, what he made, or sold, or retained, or photographed-these 3 I</page><page sequence="12">donnas. Even so, carrying the process of abstraction yet further some of Brancusi's sculptures, like the Arensberg gateway and bench of 19I7 or the Architectural Project of I9I8 became but rough-hewn wooden building.19 On the other hand, he continued to produce elegant representational objects. Some of these were made of highly finished wood while others were of harder ma- terials such as he had used earlier. Then he started putting together combinations of such objects. But the components were not in- dissolubly linked, they were merely contrasted, witness Adam and Eve, a vertical assemblage of I92I. Here Brancusi made explicit a totem pole approach to sculpture. This had already been implicit in Caryatid II with its two crowning blocks, continuable, remov- able, or replaceable at will.20 Brancusi, the man, lived an exceptionally uneventful life. Bran- cusi, the sculptor, concerned himself with a restricted number of problems, each of which he carried to a solution before taking up another. Then, at a later phase of his career he sometimes returned to a favorite problem and solved it anew in terms of his more ma- ture outlook. For the art historian each solution is provisional, a milestone in a career. He will consider Caryatid II as an essential link between the Double Caryatid of i9o8 and the colunuiar Kiss of 1933 -21 For the museum visitor, as for the artist himself, each solu- tion is a major and self-sufficient work of art. He will fervently agree with Brancusi who declared "my life has been a succession of marvelous events."22 JOHN COOLIDGE "useful objects" make up a major portion of his oeuvre and one that clearly he himself took very seriously. Moreover, the two categories are intimately related. Before that relationship can be understood some kind of inventory of the "useful objects" must be made. I9.
