<plain_text><page sequence="1">Questioning Representation Claire Colebrook The very idea that we could have a theory about mental or linguistic representations which would not be a "game" theory -which would find representations which stood in "natural" rather than conventional relations to the objects represented-is so odd that only something like Heidegger's view of the West as obsessed with the "metaphysics of presence" can account for it. (Rorty 1982, 133) [The] linguistic turn may be seen as a device for continuing to treat thoughts as objective and utterly disparate from mental events, without having recourse to the platonistic mythology. There is therefore a danger in reversing the priority of language over thought ...: the danger of falling back into psychologism. (Dummett 1993, 129) The Danger of Falling Back into Psychologism There are two ways in which postmodernity has been defined, or defines itself, as an event of representation. On the one hand, there is the approach usually associated with cultural studies, post-colonial theory, postmodern theory and literary theory. On this account of post-modernism-an account more often described by its detractors than put forward by any actual proponents-there is nothing outside representation. Truth, the real, legitimation, philosophy and the world are effects of textuality. This strong constructivism or representationalism is rarely, if ever, met with, and tends to provide a point of lament rather than any actual target. Nevertheless, there is a dominant movement across a number of disciplines that affirms the primacy and limits of representation. When Richard Rorty (1982) defines philosophy as a "kind of writing" he expresses a typical uptake of post- structuralism that sets itself the task of overcoming foundationalism, legitimation and the questioning of the world in any grand sense. This branch of postmodern theory is remarkably homely. It stresses the inevitability and desirability of remaining within the world, and at one with the domain of representation. The idea of a critical or transcendental position is not only deemed impossible but is criticized for its alienation from everyday life. SubStance # 92, 2000 47</page><page sequence="2">48 Claire Colebrook Against the legitimating meta-narratives of modernity, post-modernism returns all those grand truth claims to the domain of representation. The second way in which postmodernity is characterized by the problem of representation is in both the post-structuralist and conservative critiques of the first position.' Representation is targeted in many post-structuralist theories as the very problem of overcoming a history of Western thought that has subordinated itself.2 The idea that there is a logic-an ultimate ground or foundation of the given-ties thought to some outside or some "proper image" of itself. Ideas of being, truth, presence logic, or the real have defined thought as re-presentation: the faithful image, copy or doubling of the present.3 Western thought, it is argued, has always posited some unquestioned "transcendence" or being that is there to be represented. To liberate thought from representation would be to render thought ungrounded. No longer an act of mimesis or recognition, thought would have to be responsible for its own event. The postmodern idea that all we have are representations of the world with no possibility of an ultimate presence is still too foundationalist-for representation then comes to stand in for some grounding logic or condition. Thus, both Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault attack the very notion of the "signifier," the idea that there is a representation, sign or token that is other than some presence or sense (Derrida 1978, 281; Foucault 1972: 229). From this critique of representation as signification there are two possibilities. The post-structuralist endeavor, undertaken by Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze and Irigaray, is to question the very project of a grounding logic, a project that they see as exemplified in the modem motif of representation. This strand of poststructuralism is deeply critical of the structuralist appeal to sign systems, semiotics and representational conditions, conditions that attenuate the final moment in a Western tradition of perpetual self-grounding (Deleuze 1994 xix; Derrida 1978, 155; Foucault 1970, 208; Irigaray 1985, 133). How can the representational domain be posited as the limit point of our questioning? Surely one cannot remain within some representational totality-such as a culture, discourse, or epoch, for any recognition of such a totality implies the possibility of questioning either its legitimacy or its limit. The post- structuralist critique of postmodern representationalism often issues in an apocalyptic or utopian projection of a point beyond representation, a radical homelessness in which thought no longer locates itself within a totality, logic or scheme.And this freedom from grounding or totality would also overcome a sense of the world as being or presence, in favor of a continual becoming, effect, or non-presence. Against the location of thought within the point of SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="3">Questioning Representation 49 view of a representing subject, this anti-representationalism strives to think beyond all subjectivism. In general, representationalism might be defined most accurately as a symptom of modernity. In a number of competing and conflicting narratives, the turn towards modernity is diagnosed as a fall into representation - and this diagnosis has been adopted both by nostalgic anti-modernists who see representational epistemology and ethics as a break with the lived immediacy of the Greek polis,4 and by postmodernists who define representationalism as the persistent vestige of a Western metaphysics unable to truly confront the death of God.5 But the nosology of representationalism also has a strange habit of passing over into a celebration. While the concept of representation is held responsible for generating certain illusions of reason, reason can only be disabused of these illusions by the notion that the presence promised by representation is nothing other than representation itself. Thus representation functions as an inherently contradictory notion: at once the sign of reason's failure as well as being the goal of philosophical maturity. The paradigmatic case of this conflict can be seen in Rorty's accusation that philosophy is diseased by the idea of representation - the idea that our languages represent some extra-linguistic real. Rorty's offered therapy for this disease does not lie in a new definition of the real. Rather, Rorty hopes to redefine language as representation without presence. It is in accounts of the philosophical predicament of modernity, such as Rorty's, that the idea of representation is at once seen as a sign of crisis as well as a way of pasting over a crisis. The Diagnosis of Representation We might distinguish between two broad senses of representation, the first of which would be epistemological; and it is this sense that is usually diagnosed as one of the ills of modernity. According to a widespread narrative, prior to modernity the world was lived in the immediacy of its presence, and knowledge claims were validated through reference to the world. In modernity, however, truth is displaced by certainty. Truth is no longer a relation to the world, but is located in ideas, pictures, representations and other all too Cartesian entities. Versions of this argument that describe modernity as marked by the ghost or specter of representation are adopted (both favorably and unfavorably) by Ian Hacking (1975), Richard Rorty (1980), Michel Foucault (1970), Martin Heidegger (1967) and others. Of course, this representational turn to epistemology is often deemed curable by turning back to a richer notion of truth: where truth is understood either SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="4">50 Claire Colebrook as a relation to being (Heidegger 1971), or as the avowedly socio-political force of statements (Foucault 1972, 203). Alternatively, modern representationalism is overcome by moving forward to the point where ideas, representations, meanings and so forth are no longer mental events within some mirroring mind. In this utopian projection, language will no longer be seen as a vehicle for representation. Language would be nothing other than what it is: not the bearer of a meaning, but an action, event, performative, move in a game, or orderly procedure. In both the nostalgic and utopian forms of diagnosis, what is regarded as troubling about representation is its clumsy dualism, subjectivism and anthropologism. For if knowledge is a representation, then it must be the representation of some thing; but how could this non- or extra- representational stuff itself be known other than through representation? Through the idea of representation we are inclined to think of two sorts of stuff: the mind or subject that contains representations, plus the representations themselves-in which case the mind of man can act as a meeting point or court of judgment between the world and its representation. Man, mind or subject becomes that "mirror of nature" or spectral doubling of a world grasped representationally. It follows from this representational separation of man that we can start to think about the general conditions of representation. Man, mind, language and logic (and other ghosts in the machine) become objects of knowledge. The other diagnosis of representation is ethical/political but shares a similar structure to the previous narrative. According to writers as diverse as Jean-Pierre Vernant (1991), Pierre Hadot (1995), Michel Foucault (1988), Jurgen Habermas (1971), Alastair MacIntyre (1980) and other neo- Aristotelians, the Greeks lived their world as a polis: not as raw matter to be quantified, known and measured, and not as data to be represented. Meaning was worldly rather than individual, expressed in the idea of a "prose of the world"--a world that harbored its own sense. Ethics was less a question of rules and foundations than it was an arena of dialogue, practices, response and shared narratives. In this pre-modern and pre-representational world, there was a continuity between meaning, ethics, law, the cosmos and one's body. Ethics was lived as one's own, practiced as a way of life; and philosophy was not a procedure of valid arguments but a practice of self-formation. There was no sense of mind, epistemology or the search for impersonal universal foundations. Of course, Plato's Ideas seem to signal a universalist tendency but what needs to be remembered is that these ideas were articulated in dialogue and deemed to be attainable only through a cultivation SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="5">Questioning Representation 51 of one's soul (Hadot 1995).6 Further, the Ideas were not mental rules or accurate pictures of the world; on the contrary, the ideas were evidence that the self was able to be continuous with some cosmic order. Ethics was not yet a business of calculation or logic. The fall into modem representationalism is dated to have occurred anywhere between some point within the Platonic corpus itself (Heidegger/Foucault), or as late as the eighteenth century (MacIntyre). But whether the rupture is credited to Plato's routing of the Sophists or Kant's enlightenment foundationalism, the scar that cuts across cosmic ethical unity is representation. In representative democracies, it is argued, the good is essentially reduced to individual interests competing with other individual interests. It is only because there is no shared narrative or good polity, that individuals regard political representation as a form of protection from others and the only way in which their goals might be met. Liberalism and representation are seen as symptoms of a loss of coherence. The demand for individual representation becomes increasingly intense, the more the world appears as an alien, competitive, and inhuman marketplace. As Alastair MacIntyre argues with regard to Rawls' veil of ignorance: only in a world where I assume that my interests are in conflict with others do I have to imagine justice as an abstraction from my own being (MacIntyre 1980, 246-52). What is lost in the supposedly necessary procedure of democratic representation is the ideal of a polis that would be immediately representative, a society in which our narratives are shared (MacIntyre 1980), and a way of doing philosophy that is self-formative rather than rule-based (Nussbaum 1994). Like the criticisms of mind as a representational mirror of nature, the criticisms of democratic representationalism are intensely anti- anthropologistic. Why assume that there is a mind that then represents an outside world? Why assume that there are individuals who then contract societies, or who then compete for representation? In general, we might define anti-representationalism as an anxiety of separation. In a non-representational world, my being would be already political and already ethical, and I would need neither to compete for representation nor regard myself as having separate interests that are there to be represented. Similarly, I would not ask questions about how my language, concepts or mind-set hooked onto the world; my language would be my world. Before arguing how coherent these criticisms of representationalism are, or how accurate and conceivable a non-representational world might be, it is perhaps useful to examine at least one defense of representation. While the most frequently cited perpetrator of representation is Descartes SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="6">52 Claire Colebrook (Heidegger 1967; Rorty 1980), it makes sense to look at Kant-precisely because it was Kant's critique of Cartesian subjectivism that intensified the idea of representation in its epistemological form. And it is also Kantian ethics that provides a non-Cartesian and non-subjectivist notion of political representation. The Celebration of the Representational Dawn Rather than being a point of loss, Kant regarded representational separation as the hallmark of philosophical responsibility and autonomy. Indeed, Kant directly criticized Platonic metaphysics for imagining some direct community with a world of absolute truth while failing to consider how such truth might be given, let alone justified (Kant 1987: 240). Kant defined this as the error of anthropomorphism: failing to take into account that our world is always our world: given through concepts, experience and subject to judgement (Kant 1993, 143). It makes no sense to claim to know a pre-conceptual world in itself that would ground our judgments. Any such world in itself would only be known through our concepts. Knowledge and judgement must recognize representation as an essential condition. Rather than regarding our judgements about the world as justifiable by appealing to some pre-representational real, we have to accept the finitude of our knowledge. For Kant, accepting our representational finitude rules out a wide range of metaphysical misdemeanors and endeavors. We can no longer seek to know a point prior to time, an uncaused cause, an infinite substance and so on. Our way of knowing the world is temporal, causal and finite. Recognizing the representational conditions of knowledge precludes us from taking flight from the given and also gives knowledge a home (Kant 1933: 500; 524). But the point of view from which representation of the world takes place is only given in the representational procedure itself. According to Kant, we can resist anthropomorphism by acknowledging that our world is a represented world. But we need not fall into anthropologism: the idea that we might know some subject who is the screen, theatre or backdrop of representations. If knowledge is essentially representational, then any subject will also be given through representation; the subject who represents is a transcendental condition and not a thing within the world (Kant 1933: 244). We acknowledge that if our knowledge is given it must be given to some point of view, but precisely because it is a point of view the ground of knowledge is itself not available for viewing. The idea that we might step back and know the subject is strictly limited by the representational condition. We can know the subject as a formal procedure of representation or as a SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="7">Questioning Representation 53 practical idea. We can know the subject as it is given through the forms of experience, and we can actas ifthere were some point not determined within experience. But in both cases representation describes a procedure of experience and not a thing that is itself experienced. A similarly procedural notion of representation characterizes Kantian ethics and political theory. Rather than regarding representation as the way in which subjects with interests then engage with others-as though representation were an additional defense of my autonomous pre-social being-Kantian ethics suggests that subjects are nothing other than a capacity for representation. Thus there are two ways we might think about autonomy. The first is that there are self-present beings with a collection of features or rules who then engage with other beings who have their own rules and desires. In this case autonomy would be substantive and would be subject to the criticisms made of it both as an ethical ideal and as a possibility: a world of such autonomous agents could only be the antithesis of the ethical, where all exist to represent and secure their own ends against the ends of others. And further, such autonomy would rely upon assuming that individuals were pre-social units as opposed to being other-directed and constituted through supra-individual conditions. But if we take the Kantian criticism of Cartesian subjectivism seriously, autonomy is not a feature of moral individuals so much as a description of decision-making.7 It is because subjects are not knowable things within the world, but conditions through which the world is given, that there can be no appeal to the moral nature of subjects. In the absence of any such general moral nature, subjects must represent themselves. Representation is a process of self-formation through political expression, and not the expression of some already given self. Autonomy is the predicament of the recognition of the representational condition. If the world is always a known world, then no world in itself can be appealed to as the foundation of moral action.8 But if the knower of that world is not a thing within that world but a procedure of representing the world, then the subject cannot ground a moral law. Rather, moral law can only be achieved through representation, rather than being the outcome of a representable thing. Anti-Kantian Representationalism Following Kant, there has been an intensification of representationalism directed against the notion of the unrepresentable. While Kant acknowledged that no pre-representational world in itself could be known, he nevertheless maintained that it was necessary to assume its existence. If we take our SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="8">54 Claire Colebrook knowledge as appearance or representation then it must be an appearance or a representation of some thing. The idea that our experience is perspectival or given to a point of view demands that we think some general medium within which such a point of view or perspective is located.9 But it is just this aspect of representationalism that leads to all sorts of error, and in many ways Kantian philosophy since Kant has endeavored to purify itself of this incoherent aspect of representationalism. If we agree that representation suggests that there is some presence that is then represented, and we also give up any hope of knowing that presence, then it might be better to think outside the presence/representational paradigm altogether. This challenge takes its simplest form in certain contemporary versions of cultural studies and social constructivism. On the one hand, there are what might be termed realist versions of representationalism: those that argue that humans are representational animals and that it makes no sense to appeal to, or posit, some reality outside representation. This tradition is typified by Clifford Geertz's avowed reaction against humanism. Any time we think of a general human feature-such as religion, ethics, kinship systems and so on-we can see such putative ultimate terms only through the representation of a particular culture (Geertz 1973). Rather than posit some ultimate foundation, therefore, we should argue that human life just is representational and that it makes no sense to seek just what such life is representational of. In this sort of approach, representation is presented as the defining feature of human existence. Representation is the real "nature" of our being, a nature that also precludes any ultimate decision about nature. This type of representationalism is sustained in many forms of contemporary feminism including such sophisticated versions as that of Judith Butler. It makes no sense, Butler argues, to locate "sex" as some pre- linguistic matter that is then formed through "gender." For the pre-linguistic is only given as pre-linguistic through language. We have to see representation as positive, productive and not as some overlay behind which lies some ground or real. Representations should be assessed not according to their accuracy but according to their effects: If the body signified as prior to signification is an effect of signification, then the mimetic or representational status of language, which claims that signs follow bodies as their necessary mirrors, is not mimetic at all. On the contrary, it is productive, constitutive, one might even argue performative, inasmuch as this signifying act delimits and contours the body that it then claims to find prior to any and all signification (Butler 1993, 30). SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="9">Questioning Representation 55 Perhaps the strongest version of this form of representationalism is the challenge to the very project of philosophy and theory, a challenge undertaken not only by Rorty's pragmatism but also in the work of sociologists of philosophy such as Pierre Bourdieu. According to Bourdieu, the project of philosophy depends upon certain procedures of justification and the institutionalization of forms of argument (Bourdieu 1991, 89). Any appeal to a general truth claim, for example, has to rest upon a particular cultural form. In the case of Heidegger, for example, Bourdieu argues that Heidegger's emphasis on the primacy of the metaphysical question depends upon, and is conditioned by, social and political interests, a cultural capital granted to philosophical discourse, the metaphorization of certain practices, and the elevation of intellectuals as a distinct social power (73). What Bourdieu's phrase "political ontology" suggests, of course, is that there is no validity to ontology in general, and that whatever is said to be or exist depends upon the symbolic relations of any given culture. A similar approach to philosophy is also evidenced in Habermas's location of argument within domains of contestation. (And Habermas is also explicit about the need to overcome ontology [1971, 307]).10 For Habermas, we need to see arguments in terms of competing interests that ultimately aim at consensus; all knowledge and practices are located within a life-world, and justification occurs between competing claims, and not the relation of those claims to some real. Accordingly, Habermas both turns back to the Greek meaning of theoria-where the philosopher is an engaged onlooker and not a universal standpoint (Habermas 1971, 304)-and also looksforward to the fulfillment of modernity (Habermas 1985). In a truly modern, post- metaphysical and enlightened world, we will have disengaged ourselves from the idea that our language represents some subject or a real world. Rather, the ground for debate will be neither the subject nor the object, but the representational procedure itself (Habermas 1992). In all these forms of constructivism, we might say that the mimetic idea of representation is challenged by contesting the idea that representations are representations of some thing. Rather, representation is used to displace the notion of a man who represents and a real that is then represented. But of course the contradiction of such a method is clear, and has been clearly demonstrated. In such "post-metaphysical" approaches representation functions as a displaced ultimate real: all forms of life, language, and inquiry are seen as representations, as though this term could exempt itself from the critical process, as though the reflexivity of the idea of representation short- circuited all forms of foundation, grounding or ultimate principle. The SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="10">56 Claire Colebrook problem is, of course, that representation functions as one more general ground, and it does so precisely in opposition to its supposedly naively pre- representationalist others. It is the degree to which such models feel themselves freed from the burden of foundationalism that they become most foundational. The idea that, say, all philosophical claims are conditioned by social processes of representation halts the philosophical question, and also halts the question of the effects of posing just this limit to what is knowable. Why does representation function as the privileged boundary to the knowable? How, then, might we negotiate between the unquestioned appeal to some real in itself and the general identification of representation as what gives us the real? Post-structuralist Anti-Representationalism Within continental philosophy the question surrounding representationalism has been explored through, and underpins, what is broadly known as the critique of the metaphysics of presence. The critique takes two forms, the first nostalgic and the second utopian. The nostalgic version diagnoses representationalism from its point of emergence in modernity. Rather than think an inert world of presence that is then represented, and rather than think of language as the picture of the world or the vehicle of meaning, language might be seen as continuous with action in the world. Thus Pierre Hadot (1995) describes the Platonic dialogues not as arguments of justification but as practices of self-formation. Foucault argues that there was a time when language did not subordinate itself to transcendence-some truth outside utterances-but took place as the engaged and explicitly contestatory exchange of forceful utterances (1972: 203). And Heidegger (1992), of course, argued that before language was determined as "logic" (a set of judgments imposed on the world) it was originally "logos": a saying-gathering that emerged in the disclosure of the world (through projects, dwelling and being-in-the-world). The utopian version of anti-representationalism similarly imagines that language might not be seen as separate from the world, and might not be deemed as justifiable in relation to some outside. Rather, language would be a performance, an event, a move in a game, or a strategy. Rather than being the re-presentation of some presence-a presence that would then remain in a troubling way outside all possible language and translation-language would become poetic. For it is in the poetic function that language presents itself as positive, SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="11">Questioning Representation 57 constitutive, non-cognitive and aware of itself as language (rather than the mirror of nature). This is given its clearest expression in Heidegger: What the poetic experience with language says of the word implies the relation between the "is" which itself is not, and the word which is in the same case of not being a being. Neither the "is" nor the word attain to thinghood, to Being, nor does the relation between "is" and the word, the word whose task it is to give an "is" in each given instance. But even so, neither the "is" nor the word and its Saying can be cast out into the void of mere nothingness. ... The word itself is the giver. What does it give? To go by the poetic experience and by the most ancient tradition of thinking, the word gives being. Our thinking, then, would have to seek the word, the giver which itself is never given, in this "there is that which gives." (Heidegger 1982, 87-88) But there is also a utopian anti-representationalism at work in Derrida's reflections on the relation between philosophy and literature. For Derrida, "Beyond this division [between philosophy and literature] one may begin to see the promise or the profile of a singularity of the trace that is not yet language or speech or writing or sign or even something 'proper to mankind.' Neither presence nor absence ..." (Derrida 1995, 79). Similar calls to think beyond the division between a philosophy that faithfully represents and a literature that is mere sign are also articulated by Foucault, Lacoue-Labarthe and others. For Foucault, it is in the nineteenth century that literature enables us to think the being of language; language is not the re-presentation of the world but a force and event in its own right (Foucault 1970: 306). Phillipe Lacoue-Labarthe also calls for a reformulation of the boundary between philosophy and literature, a boundary that has enabled us to think of a pre- representational presence: "What if, after all, philosophy were nothing but literature? ... the [philosophical] desire for a pure saying is linked to the repression of writing and therefore to the thinking of being as presence" (Lacoue-Labarthe 1993, 1). The outcome of such a vision would seem to be that we abandon talk of representation altogether and achieve what is defined by Gilles Deleuze as a philosophy of immanence or a transcendental empiricism (Deleuze 1994). The idea that the world is given does seem to demand that it is given to some point of view. Thus Kant's philosophy is an empirical realism-the world is experienced as real--but is also a transcendental idealism: the world is experienced as real due to certain transcendental conditions through which the given is given (Allison 1983). Deleuze's idea of a transcendental empiricism captures the spirit of post-Kantian representationalism. From the Kantian SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="12">58 Claire Colebrook idea that it makes no sense to appeal to knowledge of some world in itself, it follows that we might seek to abandon the in-itself / representation divide altogether. Thus Deleuze argues that there simply is the givenness of the world. From this we might distinguish subjects and objects but this would always be after the event. It is not that there is a present world that is then represented, as though there were a mind, theatre or screen that mirrored an inert object world. On the contrary, the subject is an effect within the given (Deleuze 1991, 30), and the idea of a pre-representational presence or ultimate transcendence is the (late) effect of experience and not its cause (Deleuze and Guattari 1994: 59). The ethical and political outcomes of this position are radically anti-subjectivist and strongly opposed to the notion of autonomy (the idea that representation proceeds from, or expresses, a point of view). If all there is is a givenness that exceeds the point of view of the subject, then ethics can no longer adopt a vocabulary of decisions, justifications, legitimate representation or right. According to Deleuze, a philosophy of immanence will necessarily lead to an ethic of amorfati (Deleuze 1990, 149; Deleuze and Guattari 1994, 159). What is worthy is an affirmation of existence. As soon as thought regards itself as other than such an affirmation-if it regards itself as the representation of some outside--then it becomes the very opposite of affirmatory; it becomes slavish, reactive and in denial of its own possibility. While similarly denying both autonomy and the separation of a point of view who represents (Derrida 1995: 261), Jacques Derrida has formulated a political theory that remains within the vocabulary of decisions, justification and responsibility. Much of Derrida's argument depends on his philosophy of language and his anti-representationalism. If there is no presence that is then re-presented, then acts of speech, writing, representation and so on cannot be bound or grounded by some prior presence. This is why Derrida argues that we need to move beyond ontology to grammatology. Against the idea that writing or language construct or mediate some pre-linguistic presence, Derrida argues for a notion of writing that is, as he terms it, quasi- transcendental. It is not that there is a presence that is then re-presented, nor are there subjects who effect the differentiation or logic of the world. Rather, Derrida's critique of logocentrism and the metaphysics of presence directs itself against both the idea of a simple pre-conceptual real and the idea of a representational scheme, logic or structure that provides the boundary for thought."1 The idea of grammatology refers to a difference, structuration or "writing" that are not differentiations of some presence but simply "are." (Although the word "are" leads to difficulty, which is why Derrida insists that diff6rance "is not" [Derrida 1982: 3, 6]): SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="13">Questioning Representation 59 There may be a difference still more unthought than the difference between Being and beings. We certainly can go further toward naming it in our language. Beyond Being and beings, this difference, ceaselessly differing from and deferring (itself), would trace (itself) (by itself) - this differance would be the first or last trace if one could still speak, here, or origin and end. Such a diff~rance would at once, again, give us to think a writing without presence and without absence, without history, without cause, without archia, without telos, a writing that absolutely upsets all dialectics, all theology, all teleology, all ontology. (Derrida 1982: 67) Now what this entails ethically, Derrida insists, is a heightened responsibility. No utterance, statement or claim can be grounded in some prior presence. No act of language can be subordinated to context, nor seen as the innocent and simple representation of the real (Derrida 1988). Because textuality goes all the way down, we can neither enclose language within a conceptual scheme, nor see language as the simple efflorescence of presence. This leads to an anti-representationalist ethics of "responsibility without autonomy" (Derrida 1995, 261). This might be described broadly by arguing that all language is effective; it is never a simple mirror but always an event. To claim that our speech acts are determined or bound by context, or that they are straightforward mimetic presentations would be to disavow the decision of language (although this is not the decision of subjects). And for Derrida, all language is decision, and this is precisely because what precedes language is undecidable. Language is not grounded on any real, and hence is itself always a decisive force. This recognition of language's force means we must be responsible for language. At the same time, because language is no longer located within the subject's determination of the world, there can be no autonomy. The subject is already the effect of differentiation. Writing, language or difference are not "owned" by a subject. Speaking effects thus exceed and constitute subjects, and can only be examined after the event and not legitimated by appealing to some proper identity or pre- representational or autonomous subject. Problems with Both Forms of Anti-Representationalism As I've already suggested, a strain of nostalgia and utopianism runs through both forms of anti-representationalism: both the desire to return to a world that is lived as present, rather than subjectively re-presented, and the desire to overcome all commitments to presence in the celebration of a SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="14">60 Claire Colebrook differential, non-autonomous and post-human writing. If the concept of representation generates the consistent incoherence of a real that is then represented and a subject who then represents, we have to ask ourselves whether we can cleanse thought of the risky vocabulary of representation, whether we can return to the lived immediacy of pre-modern pre-subjective mutual recognition, or whether we can paste over our Cartesian separation and think a world that is not written by us but that writes itself. Is the representational antinomy or paradox an accident and is it curable? We might consider post-Kantian anti-representationalism as an increasing anti-subjectivism. Talk of schemes, representations, constructions, and paradigms does generate notions of what these schemes are schemes of. To talk of representation as a construction, schematization or structuration also implies that there is one who constructs, or that there is (to use Nietzsche's phrase) a doer behind the deed (Nietzsche 1967, 45). Representation presents us with what Michael Dummett refers to as the danger of falling back into psychologism (1993, 129). How possible is it to overcome these illusions and to remain within representation without appealing to what is, or, more important, without demanding autonomy? Perhaps representation in both its epistemological and ethical/political senses is valuable precisely for the contradictions and tensions it presents for thought. Consider, to begin with, knowledge as representation and the possibility that we might no longer trouble ourselves with an ultimate foundation for our representations, and this because any attempt to do so would bring us up against our own representational limit. In Realism with a Human Face, Hilary Putnam distinguishes between two broad readings of Wittgenstein's notion that the limits of my language are the limits of my world. The first response to such a predicament would be to rule out as nonsensical any attempt to think outside my world. The second response, favored by Putnam, would be that this recognition brings us up against the very notion that my world is my world (Putnam 1990, 28). While we have no appeal or foundation that lies outside representation, we sustain a philosophical question in the face of this inability. We might say, then, that rather than be ruled out of court as a nonsensical illusion, representation functions as a useful antinomy. The idea that our world is always a represented world renders us both responsible for that world, at the same time as we recognize our separation or non-coincidence with the world. And this might be how we can retrieve a notion of autonomy through representation in the second, ethical, sense. As I have already suggested, autonomy need not be defined as the feature of pre-social or pre-linguistic SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="15">Questioning Representation 61 moral individuals. Rather, to take an act of speech as autonomous is to see it as not grounded in a pre-given, law, nature or being. Thus the "subject" on this account would not be a substantive entity that authors its own meaning fully, but would be effected through acts of representation. Why save a notion of subjective autonomy? Think of the converse situation: a world of writing effects, disowned speech acts, performances without performers or moves in a game without players. Such a world imagines that it is possible to have a form of speech that does not carve out a point of view, that is not located in a way of being, that presents no resistance to perpetual coming and self- invention. It is a world in which the representational illusion is disavowed, a world in which speech takes place without the reifying error that I imagine myself as one who speaks. The idea that there is a writing, speaking or language that represents and that can't be owned by subjects does, quite sensibly, challenge the idea that what we say is a straightforward representation of some pre-linguistic meaning or ownness. But what such an idea of a radically anonymous writing in general precludes is the autonomy effects generated through processes of representation. Just as cultural studies-we are told- dreams of a world in which truth claims, foundations and representational claims are no longer made, and just as Richard Rorty imagines a world of ironists who accept their language games as nothing more than games and themselves as nothing more than players (Rorty 1989, 80), so the attempt to think beyond autonomy imagines a world in which what I say is not taken as issuing from the intention of some reified, congealed and illusory notion of man. But we might think of autonomy alongside the antinomy of representation. To take demands as autonomous is to recognize them as both ungrounded, as well as being demands for a certain grounding. If what I say makes a claim for autonomy, then it is both owned as what I say (and thereby institutes me as a subject), at the same time as the claim for autonomy separates this saying from any pre-given subject. To be autonomous, a claim would have to be more than a determined expression of a subject; it would have to have its own positive, singular and effective force. As Kant argued, true autonomy could not be thought of as issuing from a natural ground; but once we think an autonomous law this generates the regulative idea (but not knowledge) of a subject from whom this law has issued. Consider this antinomy in terms of some of the typical approaches to representation in popular culture-in particular, in popular feminism. It is widely asserted that women are subordinated to alien domains of representation. Eating disorders are explained by referring to the non- representative nature of bodies in the media (Wolf 1990); pornography is SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="16">62 Claire Colebrook criticized as a misrepresentation of women as passive and compliant sexual objects (Dworkin 1982); and, in general, the notion of stereo-type functions throughout feminism and other critical movements to suggest that subjects suffer from alien representations. This critical approach to alien, imposed or stereotypical representations more often than not issues in the demand for more accurate, authentic or autonomous representations. In its simplest forms, the diagnosis of certain practices as a form of representational violence is tied to the demand for an overcoming of the representational divide. This demand would supposedly be met by more realistic images of women, by non-patriarchal or non-objectifying erotica, and through the freeing of women from the representational closure of the beauty myth. What is demanded, in short, is that the subject be continuous with representations: that there might be a public domain of representation that is at one with one's inner being, where subjects would not regard themselves as extrinsic to, or belied by, a general representational norm. However, it is just this demand for non-separation from representation that sustains the problem, and part of this problem lies in not addressing the predicament of autonomy. The idea of a representation that would not be alien to my being would only be possible on two counts: either by resisting the necessary discontinuity of representation and insisting on the possibility of a proper or essential representation, or by imagining that we could do away with being altogether, such that representation would not be seen as discontinuous or alien to any pre-presentational thing. These two possibilities might be cashed out as follows. On the one hand, we could achieve a social domain of complete mutual recognition (perhaps something like the Greek polis or the bourgeois public sphere) in which the individual is thoroughly at one with the social whole. There would be no need for a demand for representation precisely because what functioned as a normative representation of the individual would already be thoroughly normal. The domain of representation would be entirely proper, not an alienation of my being, but its adequate expression. On the other hand, the representational scar might be healed by a radical resistance to representation in general: the refusal of all norms, stereotypes or reified concepts of the individual. This would issue in the pulverization of the representational domain, a multiplication of images, writing effects, simulacra or texts without author, identity or subject. On both these accounts, what is resisted, refused or targeted as a symptom is autonomy: the idea of a self or subject outside the domain of representation. In the first model of recognition, autonomy is lamented as a SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="17">Questioning Representation 63 symptom of a public/private divide that has alienated the subject from socially recognizable being. For, it is argued, I need only demand autonomy in a world that already seems set over against me, in a world that is not fully my world. In the second anti-representational model of proliferating simulacra or the virtual, what is resisted is the idea that there is an autonomous subject who represents (or is represented). There is, rather, nothing other than representation; and this means that, strictly speaking, we are no longer talking about representation. In both these cases, one imagines a continuity with the world, a non-separation of representation such that the horrors of anthropologism are resisted: life is not subordinated to some alien, imposed, or externally given notion of man. But what gets lost in this post-representational utopia (or retrieval of the pre-representational polity) is the predicament of autonomy and its attendant responsibility. If we acknowledge an essential separation of representation, then we also have to allow the question of who represents or what is demanding representation. The error of not doing so would be anthropomorphism: a failure to recognize that experiencing a world is always experiencing it in a certain way, from a certain point of view, and through a certain form of life. This does not entail substantive subjectivism - the idea that the world is given to some pre-given subject. But the world is given in a certain way, and this establishes a position with regard to the world. Acknowledging this minimal form of ownness or location of knowledge therefore entails that we cannot think of the world as writing itself, giving itself or offering itself in a dispersed, anonymous or continuous representation. The idea of autonomy enables us to think the point or determination of the world's representation: autonomy, not in the sense of giving oneself a law, but in recognizing an effected lawfulness of the self. By contrast, the dream of a pre-representational world in which all human beings recognized themselves in a common good, disavows the extent to which this common good, as common, must already have separated itself from the immediacy of any single experience. If we think of autonomy as a responsibility for the essential separation of representation, then we bring back a fruitful tension. The idea of autonomous representation is, perhaps, an oxymoron. To represent oneself is to submit to a trans-individual system of language, signification or representation. But any such representational scheme can never be fully disowned, rendered anonymous, collective, inhuman or fully dispersed beyond all subjectivity. Rather, the act of representation institutes autonomy, or places a self in a point of view. Autonomy ought not to be SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="18">64 Claire Colebrook defined in terms of a being that is then expressed. Rather, the procedure of autonomy is a recognition that there is no foundational being other than its continual institution through a representation that dislocates itself from a prior presence. If we do not recognize that representation effects an autonomy that it can then be seen to belie, if we try to overcome this scar of representation, then we do so at the expense of forgetting what it is to think. In short, we attack the error of anthropologism-the idea of a general human subject who represents us all--with the error of anthropomorphism: the idea of a world that is fully and adequately given, without representation, separation or the contribution of thought.

For a critical account of the difference between postmodernism and poststructuralism see Niall Lucy (1998). 2. Foucault's work on discourse, for example, sets itself against what Foucault sees as a general Western episteme where thought is "subjected to transcendence" (Foucault 1972, 203). 3. This is why, for Derrida, logocentrism is inextricably intertwined with the motif of representation. If thought is the faithful copy or re-presentation of a present world that bears its own logic, then there will be a full coincidence between being and thinking and a complete closure or self-presence of sense. This is most clearly argued for in Derrida's remarks on the Platonic inauguration of philosophy in Dissemination (1981). 4. Richard Rorty targets representationalism both as a disease of Western (Parmenidean) philosophy in general, and as a symptom of Cartesian dualism (Rorty 1982; 1980). But the attack on modernity and its attempt to provide rational or subjective foundations for what are in fact socially lived norms and values is also a key feature of most neo- Aristotelian ethical theories (MacIntyre 1980, Nussbaum 1994) and Frankfurt School critiques of an overly disengaged reason (Habermas 1971). 5. The early work of Lyotard exemplifies the postmodern attack on the notion of representation. rather than imagining a world that is then re-presented in mind or consciousness, Lyotard's Libidinal Economy argues for a single field of differences with no outside, no representational "theatre" and no external point of view: The representative chamber is an energetic dispositif. To describe it and to follow its functioning, that's what needs to be done. No need to do a critique of metaphysics (or of political economy, which is the same thing), since critique presupposes and ceaselessly creates this very theatricality; rather be inside and forget it, that's the position of the death drive, describe these foldings and gluings, these energetic vections that establish the theatrical cube with its six homogenous faces on the unique and heterogeneous surface. To go from the pulsion to representation, but without allowing oneself, in order to describe this implantation, this sedentarization of the influxes, without allowing the suspect facility of lack, the trick facility of an empty Alterity ... (Lyotard 1993, 3). 6. Plato's routing of the Sophists is, however, also seen as the fall of philosophy into representation; with Plato philosophy is no longer disputation but the search for some transcendent, present or "inhuman" law. According to Foucault, "The day dawned when truth moved over from the ritualized act - potent and just - of enunciation to settle on what was enunciated itself: its meaning, its form, its object and its relation to what it referred to. A division emerged between Hesiod and Plato, separating true discourse from false; it was a new division for, henceforth, true discourse was no longer considered precious and desirable, since it had ceased to be discourse linked to the exercise of power. And so the sophists were routed" (Foucault 1972, 218). A similar attack on the Socratic location of truth outside the exchange of discourse is offered in the recent work of Bruno Latour: "The impossible surgery started by Socrates continues on an even bigger scale: more Reason, more artificial blood, but less and less of this very specific form of circulating fluid that is the essence of the Body Politic, and for which the Sophists had so many good terms and we so few. The Body Politic is now supposed to be transparent to itself, freed from the manipulations, dark secrets, cleverness, tricks of the SubStance # 92, 2000</page><page sequence="21">Questioning Representation 67 Sophists. Representation has taken over, but a representation understood in the very terms of Socrates' demonstration" (Latour 1997, 236-37). 7. According to John Rawls, "acting autonomously is acting from principles that we would consent to as free and equal rational beings" (1972, 516). 8. According to Onora O'Neill, "autonomy [is] the principle of not submitting to groundless authorities, [ and is] the core of reason, hence of enlightenment" (O'Neill 1992, 299). 9. As Donald Davidson points out, if one is to talk about either a constructivist point of view or conceptual scheme, then one will also be troubled by just what such a point of view is within, or what such a scheme is a scheme of (Davidson 1984, 184). One can neither assert an uncritical pre-conceptual ground or stuff (an essence); for this would raise the question of how such pre-conceptual or pre-human ground might be known. Nor can one assert a point of knowledge or construction as though this didn't raise the question of just what was being constructed. 10. For a recent critique of ontological assumptions in favor of transcendental pragmatics see Apel 1998. 11. "What is it that is decided and maintained in ontology or dialectics throughout all the mutations or revolutions that are entailed? It is precisely the ontological: the presumed possibility of a discourse about what is, the deciding and decidable logos of or about the on (being-present). That which is, the being-present (the matrix-form of substance, of reality, of the oppositions between matter and form, essence and existence, objectivity and subjectivity, etc.) is distinguished from the appearance, the image, the phenomenon, etc., that is, from anything that, presenting it as being present, doubles it, represents it, and can therefore replace and de-present it. ... And obviously, according to a profound synonymy, what is imitated is more real, more essential, more true, etc., than what imitates" (Derrida 1981, 191). SubStance # 92, 2000</page></plain_text>
