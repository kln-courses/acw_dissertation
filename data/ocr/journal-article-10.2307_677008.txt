<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anthropomorphic Criminal. 1958. Pro- duced by NET. Black and white. 30 minutes, Rental only, $9.50, from Indiana. Edward I. Fry Southern Methodist University This horror was first released as a Kinescope from T.V. Station KGED in San Francisco in 1958. It is part of a series on Criminal Man. This re-release, on film from the University of Illinois Visual Aid% Center, is a bad idea. The film, which is hopelessly outdated, raises the main question of the relationship between phy- sique and criminality, and then backs off for 25 minutes to look at some light history of body-typing before returning to say, no, there is not a relationship between physique and criminality. If they had asked me, I'd have told them in one minute or less and saved all that money. Save yours, too; don't order this film.
