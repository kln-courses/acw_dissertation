<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES HARTSHORNE SOME REFLECTIONS ON METAPHYSICS AND LANGUAGE* According to Wittgenstein, "theology is grammar". One might also say, "metaphysics is grammar". One would hardly say, "physics is grammar" or "biology is grammar" - still less, "history is grammar". One could, perhaps, say, "arithmetic is grammar". What is the reason for this difference? In the 'grammatical' subjects the question is, how do we talk sense rather than nonsense, or how can we be clear and consistent, rather than confused or inconsistent. In the nongrammatical subjects, while of course we want to talk clearly and consistently, this is merely preliminary. The main thing is to choose between those clear and consistent ways of speaking which best fit the actual course of history, including natural or cosmic history, and those which fit this course less well, if at all. In arithmetic we relate numbers (that is, certain abstractions) not to cosmic history but to other numbers; in physics we relate certain numbers to observed facts. What do we do in metaphysics and natural theology? Do we relate ideas to observed facts, or only to other ideas? I hold that we do the latter. In so far I am perhaps in agreement with Wittgenstein. But there are many sources of misunderstand ing as to what the indicated common ground commits one to. That theology is grammatical is one way of putting the point of Anselm's proof for God. What he discovered (and my defence of the view that it was a discovery, not a mere blunder, has not been refuted) is that atheism is bad grammar.1 It is either a confused or a self-inconsistent way of talking. If 'God' is the term for the referent of the attitude of worship, then a unique mode of existence, excluding even the conceivability of nonexistence, is part of the import of that term. Hence "there is in fact no worshipful being" either lacks clarity, or it affirms a contradiction. To speak of "fact", in the normal usage which implies contingency, the conceivability of an alterna tive, in connection with the divine existence is logically inadmissible. And if 'fact' is meant in the sense in which one might say, 'it is a fact that 3 and 4 are 7', then it follows that either the nonexistence of God is absurd, just as "3 and 4 are less than 7" is absurd, or the existence and the nonexist ence of the worshipful being are alike absurd. And this is one of Anselm's * This essay is expected to form part of a book to be called Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method (forthcoming). 1 See my Logic of Perfection, 1962; also Anselm's Discovery, Open Court, La Salle, Ill., 1965. 20 Foundations of Language 2 (1966) 20-32. All rights reserved.</page><page sequence="2">SOME REFLECTIONS ON METAPHYSICS AND LANGUAGE greatest mistakes: he failed to realize with sufficient distinctness that to prove the absurdity of atheism is not to establish the logical possibility of theism. Perhaps, as Carneades had argued, the very idea of deity is a confusion or inconsistency. 'There are no round-squares' no more states a fact, in the straightforward sense of 'fact', than 'there are round-squares'. To assert or deny a paradoxical statement is very different from asserting or denying a nonparadoxical one. Anselm discovered that theism is either a hopeless paradox or a necessary truth. What it could not be is a simple factual error. But the choice between hopeless paradox and necessary truth remains to be made. As I use the term in this essay, 'metaphysics' stands for all questions whose answers are nonfactual in the same sense as the theistic question. (Finite arithmetic is the most harmless or noncontroversial branch of metaphysics.) For example, I do not believe that 'materialism' is an empirical hypothesis, factually true or factually false. I believe it is either clear, consistent and necessarily true, or not clear or consistent, and so not possibly true. The same holds of 'solipsism', 'idealism' (in a number of senses), 'phenomenalism', 'determinism', 'tychism', 'process philosophy', 'monism' (in various senses), and many other doctrines. If they make sense they are necessary truths. But do they make sense? Many of course do not. There is a view, first expressed by Hobbes, that necessity is simply a matter of the language we adopt, or as Hobbes put it, the way we use names. No one defends Hobbes's notion that words are merely names for things, but otherwise his view of modality, that it expresses only our ways of talking or writing, has a large following. It was essentially Kant's view after he gave up his early rationalism. Necessary judgments are analytic, and an analytic judgment says nothing about reality but only something about our concepts, in other words, about the meanings we assign certain terms. By changing our definitions or "meaning postulates" we can make any general statement analytic or synthetic, as we please. Richard Martin argues that modal logic "rests upon a mistake", since necessity is not properly part of the content of a proposition in the object-language, but is its classification as analytic within a given system, and hence belongs in the metalanguage. With some diffidence I wonder if this position is not in principle invalidated by the results of Godel and others showing that we have nonempirical insights, in arithmetic for instance, which cannot be captured in a formalized language, except on pain of a vicious regress. Always something escapes, and this something is no contingent fact! What else can it be, if not an objective possibility or necessity? If it be said that while a formalized language cannot capture all our a priori knowledge, a natural language can do so, then I ask what differ ence (relevant to our question) there is between a natural language and a 21</page><page sequence="3">CHARLES HARTSHORNE formalized one except that the latter alone can be made perfectly unambigu ous and testable as to its consistency? If we have "intuitive" mathematical insight which transcends formalization, then does it not transcend language itself, so far as this is strictly cognitive? It is important also to realize that there is another theory of modality which is apparently very old, in that it was more or less unsystematically and waveringly stated by Aristotle, but which has been reaffirmed in modern times by Lequier, Peirce, and others, including the present writer. This is the theory (a) that possibility and necessity are in the first place ontological (and only derivatively logical or linguistic) and (b) that they are ontological as modi of time or process. That is necessarily which is always; that happens of necessity which never fails to happen; that exists or happens contingently which exists or happens only at or during a particular or limited time. A Socinian theologian of the 17th century explicated God's eternity as follows: "He is eternal because he cannot not exist." Aristotle had said long before: "with eternal things, to be possible and to be are the same." It is almost amusing that historians of philosophy have never pointed out the relevance of this to Anselm's ontological argument. If modality is essentially temporal, surely time, and hence modality, is not an intralinguistic phenomenon! The contrast between the past as wholly fixed, no longer open to decision, and the future, as a mixture of the fixed or already settled and alternative possibilities really open for decision, is no more dependent upon language than anything you please. But, given this con trast of past and future, we can define the necessary as that which has always been part of the settled content of the future, and thus has never been and will never be an open possibility. There is an ambiguity in the notion of the fixed or settled aspect of the future. Does it mean merely that some causal law stands in the way of any thing else? But what stands in the way of a change in the law? If alternative laws are conceivable may they not sometime also be real? Only if becoming as such requires the specified feature is it impossible there should ever be an alternative. With this hint I must here content myself. The Aristotelian view may be expressed in Kantian terms by saying that "time is the schema" of all our basic conceptions, including the concepts of modality; however, contrary to Kant, time is ontological, and is no merely phenomenal affair, as it most certainly is no merely linguistic one. Kant's Newtonian determinism and view of physical geometry, and his traditional view of God as wholly timeless, stood in the way of his adopting any such theory of modality. But it is an alternative to the linguistic theory. If, as I suspect, logic itself is in process of invalidating the latter, should we not reconsider the Aristotelian alternative? (Note that medieval Aristotelianism 22</page><page sequence="4">SOME REFLECTIONS ON METAPHYSICS AND LANGUAGE was unable to take this side of Aristotle seriously, for one reason, because the standard medieval doctrine of God implied that all truth is timelessly there for omniscience. Only for our ignorance is the future irreducibly potential or indeterminate; for the wisdom that measures reality it is no less definite than the past.) I cannot here argue further for the temporalistic theory of modality; I simply call attention to the fact that the endlessly repeated dogma, used for instance against Anselm, that only propositions can be necessary, is purely question-begging in a context in which the possibility of metaphysics is the issue. Metaphysics by definition takes necessity to be ontological as well as logical. (Recall Aristotle's: "that which could not be otherwise than it is".) So, in my view, does theism, belief in the divine existence. What is the relation between metaphysics, thus conceived, and normal ways of using words? The commonest notion today seems to be that meta physical assertions are one and all what Carneades took the idea of God to be, and what I grant many such assertions are - confused or inconsistent applications of words which in more normal applications make good sense. If this is correct, then worship is in principle nonsensical, and irreligion logically obligatory. Perhaps so, but I see no conclusive argument for this conclusion in contemporary discussion. If worship is in principle sensible, then there are metaphysical views which are also sensible, though their denials are not. If theism (properly defined) is good grammar it must be true, since its denial is in any case bad grammar; but then the possibility obtains of other metaphysical statements similarly making sense and being necessarily true. Moreover, as I have argued elsewhere, from the idea of God, suitably clarified as the referent of worship, a whole metaphysical system can, by at least plausible arguments, be derived. For instance, if God is conceivable as supremely creative, unqualified determinism must be an absurdity. For, if the highest conceivable form of reality is also the highest conceivable form of creative freedom (and this is part of the meaning of wor ship), lesser forms of reality must be lesser forms of such freedom. Theo logical determinism is therefore an absurdity. One can also argue on the linguistic ground that creatures who encountered no instances of genuinely creative choice in themselves, or one another, could not even talk signifi cantly about divine creativity. Moreover, if 'real possibility' (causally open alternatives) does not make sense, neither does 'real necessity' (causally closed alternatives). Thus determinism is the absolutizing of an idea which, even in relative form, must, on the assumption, lack meaning. Let us suppose, for the purposes of this discussion, that there are neces sary metaphysical truths, denials of which are all in some fashion absurd. Is language, with its basis in everyday communication, equipped to express such 23</page><page sequence="5">CHARLES HARTSHORNE truths? Presumably any answer must be qualified. If there were no difficulty in expressing metaphysical necessities, would not more agreement have long ago been reached? If there were no possibility of expressing them, would the attempt have been persisted in so long by so many superior intellects, down at least to Peirce and Whitehead? One requirement of metaphysical conceptions is that they must have meta physical correlates or contraries. 'Worshipful' correlates with 'worshipping', 'necessarily existent' contrasts with 'contingently existent', divinely creative with more humble forms of creativity, cosmic cause with local causes. A merely negative theology tries to have it both ways, to use such correlations and yet put them out of action. It says that God does not really or literally create, if we create, or vice versa, and is not really cause if we are causes, or vice versa. This amounts to admitting that theism is hopeless paradox. A contrast, to be definite, must be spanned by some definite concept. If God is distinguished by being supreme cause, then still he is cause. When Spinoza said or implied that not simply God but all things have their existence by necessity, he was emptying 'necessity' of any clear meaning. Either he said nothing, or he contradicted himself. His error was not factual, but "grammatical". He destroyed the condition for the significance of his concept. When Quine says, or seems to say, following Hume, that nothing is, strictly speaking, necessary, he commits a less obvious form of the same mistake. But when the negative theology says that no conceptions apply to God, it is, in a perhaps still subtler way, making a comparable mistake. For where there are no definite common aspects there are no definite con trasts either. For instance, if God in no sense has magnitude or parts, then he cannot be contrasted with creatures as quantitatively infinite rather than finite; and if he also has no common qualities with creatures, then he cannot be contrasted with them as, in a definite sense, qualitatively infinite either. If God is not cause or influence, he cannot contrast with all other beings as cosmically rather than locally causative or influential. If God is said to be supremely good, then at least he is good. And if it be said that He is "good ness itself", not one more instance of goodness, then either this is bad grammar or some qualification is required. For surely God is individual, not a mere universal. In addition "goodness" has to have somehow a common meaning in this and other uses. It is to be noted that this requirement of common meaning in metaphysical contrast may be broken in quite opposite ways. To say, only God literally creates, is not to exalt God in any definite way. For you might as well say, only God dubdubs. What does 'create' mean if there are no other examples? To say (with Tillich - and Peirce, in some passages), only creatures literally exist, is again not to exalt God in any definite way - unless another word, per 24</page><page sequence="6">SOME REFLECTIONS ON METAPHYSICS AND LANGUAGE haps 'being', is introduced for God which does apply to the creatures as well, and then the relation between existence and being will repeat the problem. Collingwood's famous objection to metaphysics, conceived as arguably true, that it tries to find ideas applying to everything, and thus must violate the requirement of contrast is, I hold, an error. The task is precisely to preserve contrast even on the level of metaphysical generality. And this can be done. There are two basic forms of contrast which are not abolished by metaphysical conceptions. One is that between God and any other individual being; the other is between logical types. To take the latter first: what is necessarily true of any possible individual need not be true of any possible event; yet both truths are metaphysical rather than factual, i.e., they concern what makes sense rather than merely what happens in the actual world. Again, what must be true of every possible abstract quality need not be true either of every individual or of every event. Yet again it will be metaphysical. The generality which metaphysics requires need not - indeed it must not - in all cases transcend logical-type distinctions. It need only cover all possible cases of each type. True, we need a general idea of reality which applies to individuals, as well as to events and abstract qualities; but then there will be the contrast between real and fictitious entities, whether individuals, events, or qualities. Whitehead's "to be is to be a potential for becoming" applies to any reality whatever, but it leaves intact the contrast between merely supposed or fancied and real potentials. If Peary did not really get to the North Pole, his getting there will influence no case of becoming, though his really claiming that he did will do so. And if "being a fairy" has no definite and consistent meaning, as I suspect it has not, then this alleged quality is not a potential for any future becoming. In addition to the most general or neutral idea of reality, spanning all logical types, we need metaphysical universals valid only within one type. Only if this is seen can certain historical doctrines be appropriately evaluated. That minority of philosophers (sometimes termed 'panpsychists', but I prefer 'psychicalists') who have said that sentience, or some minimal form of experiencing or mind, is universal have not really said that literally 'everything' feels or experiences. For no one ever thought that the color blue is a subject with feelings, still less, if possible, that triangularity is such a subject. Abstractions do not feel or think, not even the abstraction 'feeling' or 'thinking'. These are objects of feeling or thought, not feelers or thinkers. So Collingwood's argument cannot be used against psychicalism. But more important, the proposition, 'every individual feels', does not entail, every group of individuals is a single subject with its own feelings. If each of two birds feels there is not a third subject of feeling, the pair of birds. The 'group 25</page><page sequence="7">CHARLES HARTSHORNE mind' is either metaphorical, in an extreme sense, or its applicability has definite limits. Thus psychicalism not only does not hold that everything feels, it doesn't even hold that everything concrete feels, if groups of individ uals are regarded as concrete. I suggest, however, that groups, merely as such, are not fully concrete. Collections require collectors, sums summators. A pair of birds is perhaps an entity for each member of the pair - if they are mated, or neighbors, say - but it is not concretely the same entity in the two cases. The concrete reality of groups is in individuals, not vice versa. (A theist may argue that the definitive or fully concrete reality of all groups is in God's appreciation of the individuals composing them.) Groups fail to be subjects only because they are irreducibly objects for subjects; they are individuals only as particular collective termini for the perceptions and thoughts of individuals. If this point can be maintained, then we may say that psychicalism is the doctrine that everything concrete feels, with the understanding that nothing irreducibly collective is, as such, concrete. To maintain this defence against Collingwood's charge, a metaphysician must eschew extreme nominalism, he must admit that distinctions of logical type have counterparts in extra-linguistic reality. But this is in any case necessary for a viable metaphysics. Is it legitimate to stretch the meaning of 'feeling' sufficiently so that it becomes a metaphysical ultimate applicable to every concrete individual? And is a table, say, such an individual? Of course the psychicalist must reject this example. He must say that while this table here before us is relatively concrete, compared, say, to the general idea of tables as such, it is still far from absolutely concrete. The senses are abstractive agencies, as Whitehead has sought to explain in his theory of perceptual 'transmutation'. There are cogent biological reasons why they must be so. However, it is not apparent that 'ordinary language' needs to recognize, in any obvious way, the pervasive abstractness of our pragmatic concepts of physical instrumentalities. Nor mally we simply use 'inanimate' physical things, and perceive them chiefly with an eye to their use; we do not ordinarily even ask what they are apart from our uses, or apart from the human species, or 'in themselves', or for God. These questions are somewhat abnormal, hence their answers will not lie on the surface of normal language. Of course tables do not feel; but it does not follow that there is no feeling in them. There is feeling in a flock of birds or in a swarm of bees, but the flock or the swarm feels nothing. So there can be feeling in a swarm of molecules, though the swarm does not feel. The analogy is intelligible, and I fail to see any hopeless misuse of language in stating it. Is the question one of fact? Yes, but only in its detailed or specific aspects. Thus it might be atoms not molecules, or vice versa, or both, which are 26</page><page sequence="8">SOME REFLECTIONS ON METAPHYSICS AND LANGUAGE the concrete singulars. And it is also a mere matter of fact that some visible objects in our world, such as vertebrate animals, are genuine singulars, whereas in large parts of nature the visible entities are exclusively collections, unified only as objects for our perceptions. Such unindividual parts of nature we term 'inanimate' - or 'vegetable', for it seems likely that trees are essenti ally collectives, colonies of cells, without any unity comparable either to that of single cells or to that which a nervous system gives vertebrates. By recognizing the logical-type distinctions involved (as no philosopher before Leibniz, so far as I know, ever did, and disgracefully few have done since Leibniz) the apparent absurdity of generalizing psychical conceptions to cover all possible (concrete) reality is at least substantially mitigated, and in my opinion indeed shown to be apparent only. Psychicalism, I hold, is implicit in theism. If supreme reality is supreme mind or experience, lesser forms of reality can only be lesser forms of mind or experience. To introduce mere matter is to destroy the intelligibility of the doctrine. Mere matter, as the zero of feeling and intrinsic value, throws no light even on the possibility of a supreme form; it is an absolute negation whose meaning is wholly parasitic on what it denies. Matter is no more the principle of reality than zero is of number. Primitive animism or hylozoism, though of course fanciful in all details, was yet sound in its broad principle. Also not without reason have materialists seldom been theists, while theists have generally felt antipathy for materialism. But dual ism is merely an evasion of the issue. The very concept of mere matter as a possible form of reality has no place in a theistic metaphysics (really, in any metaphysics). The zero of mind is the zero of likeness to deity; but (assuming theism is good grammar) the creature can only be some sort of inferior resemblance to the supreme creative cause. If all individuals (other than mere collectives) are sentient, then does not 'sentient individual' lose its distinctive meaning? It does indeed become truistic, a sort of redundancy. Yet redundancy is not always useless. Since there are many sorts of deceptive pseudo-individuals (individual only as objects, relative to certain subjects) which of course are not sentient, it is worth while to insist that the task of finding genuinely or intrinsically in dividual entities is the same as that of finding genuinely sentient entities. And indeed the criteria are the same. That is individual which either acts or feels individually. Tables do neither; they are not sentient individuals, because they are not in themselves individual. They do not act on their own, so of course they do not feel on their own. Feeling as one and acting as one are but two sides of the same thing - i.e., existing as one. Ordinary language is largely concerned with specifically human purposes and feelings, not purposes or feelings at large. This strong anthropomorphic 27</page><page sequence="9">CHARLES HARTSHORNE bias is normal. Since metaphysics is the extreme form of trying to transcend it, the metaphysician is in a somewhat abnormal attitude. The materialist absolutizes the normal bias in a strange way, while also negating it. He carries to the limit that neglect and seeming denial of the inner, qualitative feeling-side of reality which the collective selfishness of human beings has already accepted for most of nature, and argues that we can achieve conceptual universality and objectivity only by getting rid of this aspect, even in our own human case. I sympathize with the attack on anthro pomorphic subjectivism but hold that the way to overcome the latter is to see that we have no conceivable ground for limiting feeling to our kind of individual, say the vertebrates, or even to animals. The way out of collective selfishness is into completely generalized unselfishness, sympathy with the universal 'life of things', the 'ocean of feelings', which is reality in its concrete character. How the "extendedness" of physical reality is to be understood in these terms has been discussed by various authors, including this one. We have said that there are two forms of contrast which fall within metaphysics, i.e. are a priori not empirical, one being contrasts of logical type and the other being the distinction between God and other things. We have now to see that this is really a unique form of logical-type distinction. As necessary in his existence God is logically different from other individuals. Here you may well ask: What common meaning can individual then have? My answer, not the traditional one by any means, is this: existing necessarily, God nevertheless, like any individual you please, exists by virtue of concrete states ('experiences') which themselves, in their concreteness, are contingent. Thus, on his concrete side, God is of the same logical type as other individuals. Where then is his necessity? Quite simple: the class of his possible states could not be empty; whereas with other individuals there might not have been any such states. To say that a class could not be empty is not at all to say that its particular members are necessary. "You must come to a decision" does not say, there is a certain particular decision to which you must come. It only says, the class of your decisions for this matter cannot remain empty. God has no option between existing and not existing, but - and there is no inconsistency in this - he has options as to how he exists, in what particular states. (I am of course fully aware that this is a shocking departure from much of the tradition. I can only say that, for me, what is shocking is precisely this part of the tradition. It seems to me to incompatible with the notion of worship.) Between 'possibly empty' and 'necessarily nonempty' classes there is a logical-type distinction - logical because modal, and a matter of meaning, not contingent fact. Some will doubtless fear that putting God into the same logical type with 28</page><page sequence="10">SOME REFLECTIONS ON METAPHYSICS AND LANGUAGE creatures destroys the awe-inspiring gulf between him and us. I think this is a mistake, though a natural one. (1) The contingent side of God is the concrete side. The concrete embraces the abstract, not vice versa. Hence God qua contingent is more than God qua necessary, not less. (2) Whereas we as con tingent are contingent all through, nothing unique to us being necessary, God's contingent states, on the contrary, contain His necessary eternal essence. (3) God's contingent actuality includes ours fully and adequately (omniscience), but not vice versa. Any value in us is therefore ipso facto in Him; the converse does not hold. Thus He transcends any and all other concrete realities, and it is impossible they could surpass or rival him. If anyone feels no awe before the idea of one "to whom all hearts are open", to whom all past cosmic history is a fully legible book, and by whom all that ever comes to be will be fully appreciated in every nuance of quality, then I can only suppose he does not genuinely contemplate the meaning of such expressions. But they are not only compatible with the contingency of God as concrete, they imply it, if I understand their meaning at all. Note that one who treats 'mind' or 'feeling' as a limited affair can certainly not make sense out of 'God'. If the concept of mind, spirit, or awareness can stretch all the way up to deity (as knowing and valuing His creatures) it must have strictly infinite possibilities. What then could prevent it from covering also the gap (surely smaller) between man and atom? Logical-type differences alone can set limits to the applicability of "X feels". Moreover, even the logical-type difference between God and the mere creatures does not forbid the application of this formula to both sides of this supreme gap. For, as argued above, God must be allowed a contingent aspect by virtue of which He is, on that side, of one logical type with other individuals. And in fact, only as contingent does God feel. In his merely eternal and necessary aspect He is not an actual subject of thinking or feeling, but only an object, both of his own thinking - which in each actual case is contingent - and of crea turely thought. I believe that it is reasonable enough to tie together suspicion of meta physics as such and suspicion of theism as such. To this extent, Carneades saw the issue correctly. Metaphysics and natural theology share a common fate. But that Carneades - or Hume - correctly decided the issue - that is another matter! If metaphysical statements are to be possible, certain assumptions about language must be avoided. One must not say that all existential propositions are contingent or factual, or that all positive generalizations are so - for instance, 'every event is influenced by, but partially transcends, antecedent events (its causal conditions)'. If this statement is metaphysically correct, both determinism and the admission of causally uninfluenced happenings fail 29</page><page sequence="11">CHARLES HARTSHORNE to make sense. Creativity and causal limitations are metaphysical correlates. Consider the endless attempts to show the compatibility of freedom and determinism. As Bridgman, Korner, and others have shown, every attempt to take the causal principle absolutely leads to paradox, not simply because of freedom, but in many other ways. No one knows what it would be like for causal order to be absolute. Why try to harmonize freedom with a conception we do not possess? The real question is not, is causality limited or unlimited, but rather, what can we know about its limits? The classic example of begging metaphysical questions unconsciously is Hume's Dialogues. He asserts as a dogma that nonexistence is conceivable in all cases - from which it follows that theism is bad grammar. But then the empirical arguments of the Dialogues are irrelevant. Hume also asserts that if two entities are distinguishable they are mutually independent. In that case the creatures, being distinguishable from their creator, could exist without him. Again, bad grammar. Thirdly, Hume assumes that strict determinism makes sense. But the absolutizing of order destroys its contrast with disorder, and hence leaves neither concept with anything to say. And it implies the absurdity of theism as belief in supreme creativity. Is it any wonder that Hume could arrive at no plausible metaphysical or theistic conclusion. His rules forbade a metaphysical outcome in any sensible form. Is it not permissible to derive some amusement from the way so many of our contemporaries reenact Hume's performance - without seeing the joke? Or the way Mill and William James reenacted it? Hume, like the Greeks and Jews before him, puzzled over the evils of life on the assumption that God is to be conceived as, in an absolute or deterministic sense, cause of all that happens. But if He is cause of all, in the sense of deliberately choosing all, then what do we cause or choose? Our supposed choices must be but parts of the divine choice. But then only He really chooses, faces truly open alter natives. In which case, what do we mean by 'choice'? The concept of omni potence, in the problem-of-evil sense, is thus a pseudo-concept. Hence no facts of evil are needed to discredit it. Its own internal illogic suffices for that. One of the ways in which the followers of Carneades beg the question about the possibility of a sane metaphysics is by selecting as examples of metaphysical doctrine egregiously bad ones, which can plausibly be inter preted as disguised commands not to use certain parts of normal language. Thus "time is unreal" means, when claiming to talk seriously or profoundly, do not make temporal distinctions, talk about dates, or before and after! Or "everything changes" means, do not talk about individuals or properties as identifiable through time. But sane metaphysics is rather the opposite of this. It tries to make sense out of change and permanence, time and eternity, unity and plurality, quality and structure, freedom and order. 30</page><page sequence="12">SOME REFLECTIONS ON METAPHYSICS AND LANGUAGE Hume's dictum, no event is logically dependent upon any other, is no better and no worse than Blanshard's contention that every event implicates every other. The proper metaphysical question is, what rules govern relations, making them extrinsic or dispensable to some terms, and intrinsic or in dispensable to others? The answer will not readily be found simply by asking how we ordinarily talk, though this may well carry us part of the way. We do talk as though events depend upon what happens before, not upon what happens afterward, as though dependence were asymmetrical. Hume (like Russell) never seriously considers this; he, and his opponents Green or Bradley, takes symmetry for granted. On that basis events are either in dependent both ways, or dependent both ways. Similarly, Spinoza makes God necessitate the modes and the modes necessitate God, neither being in dependent of the other. (Or at least, he does not clearly say what else his view is.) Here too symmetry is assumed. But the theist has a clue to this problem in the unique necessity of the divine existence, which implies that while God could exist without this particular world, the latter could not exist without God. Indeed, "without God" is ungrammatical. To ask, What could exist without God is like asking, What could exist if 3 and 4 were not seven? The question is no question. But 3 and 4 could and would be seven, even though this particular world did not exist. So could and would God exist as God without this world. Dependence is here asymmetrical funda mentally. The assumption of universal symmetry - whether of dependence or independence - is antitheistic. It is also absurd on the face of it. On the other hand, there is an important though subordinate aspect of symmetry in the relations of God to the world. Though God does not depend for existence upon other individuals, as they depend upon Him, he does depend upon them for the contingent content of his omniscience. Obviously God could not know of my existence were there no such existence to know. And he could not know that I make certain choices did I not make them. In freely deciding my own course of action I decide items in God's knowledge. (If I decide less than this I decide nothing, for God's knowledge is the measure of reality.) Thus we influence God. Since He certainly influences us, there is interaction between us. What then is the superiority on the divine side? It is that God universally or cosmically, and ideally adequately, both influences others and responds to their influence, while we only locally and in more or less adequate or inadequate ways interact with others. This is no merely finite difference. All the past actually, in every least aspect, and all the future potentially, both influences and is influenced by God. But after a few years more, what happens will not in fluence us in any degree whatever, and what happened before our birth was quite free from any influence by us. The scope of God's interaction, and only 31</page><page sequence="13">CHARLES HARTSHORNE of His, is coextensive with reality. This sets an, in a sense, unbridgeable gulf between him and us. Nevertheless the gulf is in another way conceptually spanned, for it is literally true that God is influenced as well as influences, and this much is true of us. God (in his contingent states) is logically de pendent upon what happens in others, and they upon what happens (yes, happens) in Him. But this two-way influence is subject to a basic asymmetry connected with the directionality or modal character of time. My decision just made influences God (is perceived by Him) only as one I have just made, and thus his knowledge that I have made it comes too late to influence that decision. (God's 'plan' for the world is precisely not his omniscience in its fullness.) Only in this way can we preserve (as metaphysicians must always do) the contrast inherent in our conception. To suppose that all relations involve logical dependence in every direction, and independence in none, or vice versa, is to imply that neither 'dependence' nor 'independence' really says anything. The widespread belief that there is no genuine logic of metaphysical conceptions, no rules of the game of talking metaphysically, seems to me in correct. The logic may not be easy to get clear about, and the rules have perhaps scarcely been set forth in print, much less generally heeded by those classed as metaphysicians. But there are those of us who think we know some such rules and are trying to state and obey them. It should be clear that I am in hearty agreement with much current writing in treating metaphysical questions as meaning questions. Metaphysical truths are necessary, not factual. But when Wittgenstein says that necessary propositions "say nothing", I want to add to 'nothing' the words 'factual or contingent'. Yet the propositions do say something true about God and any possible creatures, for instance that God exists and could not not exist, but that any creature could have failed to exist; also that God or creatures could have existed in different states, and in their creative freedom transcend causal conditioning and are never causally limited to a single course of action. Also that only collectives or abstractions are strictly insentient. Since students of the logic of mathematics have not been able to agree upon the axioms of set theory, nor in spite of Quine to agree that such questions are ultimately factual, with what right can anyone rule out the possibility that metaphysical questions are neither factual nor trivially analytic, but in some subtle and difficult sense questions of meaning and consistency ?
