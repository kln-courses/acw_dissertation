<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Tova Hartman  Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism:   Resistance and Accommodation Hanover and London: Brandeis University Press, 2007 reviewed by Tamar Ross Feminism Encounter Traditional Judaism is a collection of essays that were  no doubt originally written as separate pieces, but have now been adapted  and joined together by a common thread. In dwelling upon various points of  encounter and tension between feminism and Jewish tradition, they reflect a  process that Hartman herself has undergone in formulating and then estab- lishing a new model for Orthodox synagogue worship, capable of addressing  feminist and egalitarian sensibilities. In this sense, the book is the background  story of the founding of the first Orthodox “partnership” minyan, which to a  great extent was established as a result of Hartman’s initiative and vision. The book begins by addressing some of the general issues that set the stage  for Hartman’s project. Thus, Chapter 1 (“Feminism and Modern Orthodoxy”)  reflects upon the problematic relationship between feminism and Orthodoxy  in light of Modern Orthodoxy’s relationship to modernity at large; Chapter 2  (“Facing the Legacy of the Canon”) lists the range of possible responses avail- able to feminists when confronted by canonical texts whose truth or dictates  are no longer real or viable in their eyes, using various responses to Freud’s  understanding of the psychology of women as a model. The following chap- ters focus on a few more specific issues that arise in the effort to formulate a  halakhic approach that is more attuned to women and their subjective experi- ence in the context of prayer, and dwell on the broader ramifications involved.  Chapters 3 (“Modesty and the Religious Male Gaze”) and 4 (“The Patriarchal  Voice in Liturgy”) belong to this category. While Chapter 5 (“The Hands of  Rabbis: Orthodox Women and Niddah”) has no direct bearing on the notion of  NASHIM: A Journal of Jewish Women’s Studies and Gender Issues. © 2009 185 </page> <page sequence="2"> Tamar Ross partnership minyanim, this survey of Orthodox women’s responses to another  area of potential dissonance with women’s felt needs and sensibilities serves  Hartman to illustrate various methods of feminist co-existence with traditional  norms bearing an androcentric thrust, as exhibited in a comparable field.  The final two chapters (“Roles, Rules and Responsa: The Backlash against  Feminism” and “Go Away and Change”) provide a critique of establishment  resistance to feminist efforts. The first thing to be said about this book is that Tova Hartman knows how to  write. Her style is both forthright and highly articulate, allowing her obvious  sense of conviction and passion for her cause to come through in no uncertain  terms. Never one to beat around the bush, she is prepared to formulate difficult  questions with profound clarity and then face them head-on. The intensity of  her highly charged engagement with tradition benefits from occasional play- ful asides: as her sense of cognitive dissonance with tradition increased, her  questions “became fruitful and multiplied” (p. 20); parallels between Modern  Orthodoxy and secular modernity appear where “the Lonely Man of Faith  meets the Lone Ranger” (p. 13); and a critique of the over-protective coddling  of the religious male gaze is introduced by the heading “Samson the Nebbish”  (p. 51). More importantly, Hartman is perceptive and insightful; she has a flair  for sharp, incisive analysis and thinking outside the box. Although the initial  impetus for Hartman’s project of feminist re-engagement with tradition was  the wish to eliminate the contradictions in her life and—as she puts it—bridge  the gap between teaching feminism in a university setting and praying behind  a meḥitzah in shul, her recognition of the necessity to live in “creative tension”  between conflicting loyalties often leads her to unexpected, thought-provoking  formulations that turn stereotypical attitudes on their head. At times, Hartman’s multi-layered approach leads her to expose popularly  held fallacies of Modern Orthodoxy with regard to feminism by casting them in  a new light. Ample illustration of this already appears in the first chapter, where  Hartman counters Modern Orthodoxy’s allegation that the feminism entails  importing foreign values into Judaism by contending that Modern Orthodoxy  is no less guilty of absorbing Western influences that bear little relationship  to the Jewish past. Amongst such influences are the modernist celebration of  human autonomy and the valorizing of a Kantian-like morality that regards  decisions based on principles—rather than on consequentialist or relational  considerations—as the highest level of moral development, as evidenced in the  thought of Rabbi J.B. Soloveitchik and Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz. These  186 • Nashim 17 (2009) </page> <page sequence="3"> Tova Hartman: Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism may be contrasted with more feminine ways of thinking that do not regard  autonomy as a universal human ideal and prefer to uphold relationships as a  central concern. Hartman argues that this narrow appropriation of modernity  loses the medieval sense of being at one with the world, central to a traditional  religious mind-set. Ironically, then, she suggests, it may be that feminism, by  restoring themes congenial to women’s ways of thinking that have been lost in  the wake of a selective, androcentric appropriation of modernity, is far more  loyal to native Jewish values than are certain segments of Modern Orthodoxy. Hartman posits that this same masculine tendency to atomization encourages  adherents of Modern Orthodoxy to build their religious image on a negative  identity rather than on continuity and relationships. She then shows how this  method of self-determination (“I know who I am by who I am not”) may be seen  to underlie the otherwise inexplicably vehement objections with which small  requests for increased participation of women in ritual and other public roles  are met, even in the admitted absence of halakhic obstacles. Exaggerated fear of  blurring the boundaries between Orthodoxy and other denominations that have  adopted more egalitarian practices is simply another example of the manner in  which a male bias influences the selective imbibing of “foreign” ideals. Only  such a bias can explain why certain influences of contemporary Western cul- ture (as evidenced in the influence of modern nationalism on Zionism) can be  embraced by various Modern Orthodox segments as the natural outgrowth of a  traditional worldview, while others are regarded as beyond the pale. Thus, Hartman refuses to reduce the conflict between feminism and tradition  to questions of practical halakhah or even to a superficial favoring of easily  identifiable male interests and male hegemony in weighing questions of public  policy. Instead, she views the conflict in much deeper terms. Ultimately, it has  to do with a specifically masculine approach to the world, implicit as much in  the unique understanding of modernity appropriated by one form of Modern  Orthodoxy as in the patriarchal religious proclivities of a bygone age. Following  in the footsteps of her academic mentor, Carol Gilligan, author of the influential  book In a Different Voice,1 Hartman offers a cultural, post-liberal rendition of  feminism that seeks far more than an equal slice of the male-baked pie. The implications of Hartman’s commitment to maintaining a “creative ten- sion” between tradition and feminism are not limited to a more subversive  reading of the religious element of this equation. At times, her dual loyalties  have the opposite effect, leading her to reveal the extent to which feminists  bearing an anti-religious bias do not practice what they preach. According  187 </page> <page sequence="4"> Tamar Ross to Hartman, such feminists deviate from their own guidelines, ignoring the  subjective experience of the women concerned when estimating the measure  of oppression they suffer in acquiescing to traditionalist norms. Examples of  this religiously inspired critique of some feminists’ selectivity and betrayal  of their own values can be found in her treatment of the patriarchal voice  in liturgy or in her evaluation of Modern Orthodox women’s attitudes to the  laws of niddah. In both these cases, Hartman defends continued compliance  with traditional norms by revealing the methods by which the significance of  originally androcentric practices can be transformed. In the case of prayer, Hartman argues, the need to bridge the chasm between  the original import of fixed texts and the lessons of subjective experience is  already acknowledged in classical rabbinic sources, allowing for the intro- duction of creative new interpretations. Such interpretive leeway, she sug- gests, can easily be extended to ameliorating women’s frustrations with the  “He” language and imagery offered in prayer. In this case, the added subtlety  afforded by Hartman’s appropriation of cultural feminism once again comes  into play. The feminine inclination to partake in experience rather than express  it abstractly, and to shift the center of living from self-consciousness to self- surrender, renders this moderate solution more appealing than a more radical  move to change the language of prayer. Hartman’s findings regarding women’s attitudes to the ritual laws surround- ing menstruation are somewhat more equivocal—perhaps because this chapter  is the product of a study based on actual interviews, and not merely of theoreti- cal speculation. As a result, it includes concrete acknowledgement of some of  the more oppressive and degrading aspects of this observance, as sensed by  women who practice it (e.g., the legal impotence and dehumanization involved  in the requirement to turn to male experts with samples of their most intimate  bodily secretions; and rabbinic obliviousness to women’s psychological need  for more diversified forms of physical contact than the sexual act itself), along- side appreciation for some of the fringe benefits that women have managed  to discover in such halakhic dictates. Irrespective of whether these benefits  are inherent or incidental, here, too, Hartman refuses to implicate Orthodox  women’s reaction to niddah “on an axis of collaboration-resistance” (p. 97)  and hopes to “deepen the sense of texture and humanity of the women who  choose to live within traditional frameworks and to encourage others to value  their experience more highly.” (p. 98) 188 • Nashim 17 (2009) </page> <page sequence="5"> Tova Hartman: Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism Given the broad leeway that Hartman allows for reinterpretation, I was  nevertheless struck by a certain inconsistency evident in her own readiness to  accommodate traditional views, one that begs explanation. As against her great  measure of willingness to make peace—via interpretive tactics—with the patri- archal language of liturgy, and her relatively conciliatory tone even with regard  to the laws of niddah, her critique of the externalized standards of modesty  imposed upon women in a traditional context appears disproportionately harsh.  Hartman accepts the traditionalist critique of contemporary secular society as  a culture in which women are dominated by the male gaze, but contends that  the traditional observance of modesty, “despite being framed as the antithesis  of Western values, religious discourse, and even practice, preserves precisely  those unsavory elements with which it claims to be at war” (p. 46). Both obsess  inordinately with regard to women’s bodies, the difference being that secular  society exerts pressure on women to uncover them, while religious society  urges their covering. Both approaches, Hartman suggests, strip women of their  human dignity, by relating to them primarily as a collection of bodily parts.  Yet in this case Hartman does not follow her own advice, and fails to take into  account the felt experience of many of the women who willingly appropriate  the stringent standards of dress and behavior prescribed by religious tradition,  investing what might well be understood as an inordinate privileging of male  interests with new meaning.2 After all, the same objection to the asymmetrical  distribution of constraint versus freedom that Hartman raises when comparing  the lot of women and men in the realm of modesty can equally be applied to  the realm of family purity,3 And if women’s willingness to acquiesce to the  artificial construction of their social role in the realm of modesty is dismissed  merely as the product of false consciousness and cultural conditioning, that  dismissal can be applied to the realm of niddah laws as well. The same may be said of liturgical changes. While Hartman recognizes  the formative impact that the language of prayer exerts on the person who  uses it, in this case she is willing to tolerate the tension between the words of  the liturgy and the subjective experience of contemporary women, not only  because of the halakhic gravity with which these words are invested, but also  because they allow us to “participate in a relationship with Jewish communi- ties that spans time and space” (p. 69). She is also willing to deconstruct the  theological meaning of male imagery, and to dismiss over-scrutiny of God’s  gendered nature as a useless exercise in anthropomorphism; but she is not  189 </page> <page sequence="6"> Tamar Ross prepared to grant the same respect to apologetic efforts at granting legitimacy  to standards of modesty for women that are defined solely by male needs. Yet  a disproportionate focus on women’s modesty and the externalization of its  definition in precise physical terms have been a feature of religious discourse  from the Bible on, arguably bearing a halakhic weight comparable to that of  the paternal voice in liturgy. In voicing this criticism, I do not mean to imply that there is no room for  distinguishing between feminist attitudes towards male descriptions of God,  or the laws of family purity, and religious focus on the female body. What I do  suggest is that if such distinctions are to be made, these need to be accompa- nied by some well-reasoned and explicitly stated rationale. Hartman does, in  fact, allude to this need in another context, when she asks: “At what point does  a critical approach to religious texts (reinterpreting and engaging critically)  prevent us from relating to the text as real and viable?” (p. 21) In other words,  when are we justified in rejecting a religious tradition outright, as opposed to  reinterpreting or transforming its meaning by framing it in another context? A naively objectivist response to Hartman’s question might be a formalis- tic one, introducing some new distinction that would justify differentiating  between these realms in terms of their amenability to change. Aside from the  likely disinclination of traditional circles, in their current climate of discourse,  to accept such a distinction, a self-aware feminist will find this strategy highly  problematic, recognizing as she will that the ostensibly objective context within  which the process of differentiation takes place is never neutral and value-free.  Since the requirement for women’s modesty is nurtured by two diametrically  opposed conceptions (an extreme model of male brutishness/helplessness in  the face of women’s irresistibly seductive power, and a contrary perception  of women as asexual creatures bearing no physical desires of their own), one  might reasonably suspect that the ultimate motivation for religious emphasis  on covering up the female body does not lie in either of these rationales. A  typically feminist attack on current standards might argue that the motivation  is to be found in the reprehensible male urge for hegemony. In another context,  however, such standards might be defended in light of the positive effects of  the heightened sexual tension that they engender, or by pointing to the cul- tural richness that socially constructed gender differences provide, benefiting  women and men alike. All this serves to highlight the predicament that contemporary feminists  must face in abandoning the objectivist rhetoric of formalism in favor of a more  190 • Nashim 17 (2009) </page> <page sequence="7"> Tova Hartman: Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism deconstructive approach that seeks to expose the underlying motives behind  the legalistic trappings of halakhic deliberation. Despite greater awareness of  the role that values, ideological biases and even power politics play in shap- ing halakhic discourse, even a feminist must acknowledge that a hermeneutic  of suspicion accomplishes little in helping us determine which changes can  be contained within that overworked but highly debatable Modern Orthodox  concept, “the parameters of halakhah,” and which fall beyond the pale, or can  be relegated to determiners of public policy or to personal discretion. More- over, acknowledging the importance of social consequence and attunement  to subjective experience in legal deliberation does not obviate the fact that  constraining rules and procedural conventions provide the basis for an internal  consistency that is critical to the rule of law. In another day and age, we might have relied on the intuition of the recog- nized halakhic giants of the generation, but Hartman makes it abundantly clear  in the final two chapters of her book that she, for one, is not prepared to rely on  authoritative dictates from the religious establishment in assessing the intrin- sic value of women’s religious subjectivity and the relative weight it should  carry in advancing more egalitarian practices. Although she does recommend  “general acceptance of Orthodox authority, while challenging or ignoring it on  certain issues” in setting the ground for a constructive feminist re-engagement  of Orthodoxy, her caustic critique of the backlash tactics employed by “the  keepers of the gate” leaves us wondering where the border between “general  acceptance” and “certain issues” lies, and leads us to suspect that she would  be very reluctant to leave even the decision as to which issues are open to  negotiation in their hands. Indeed, the establishment of Shira Ḥadasha is a fair  indication of the dramatic change that the status of poskim has undergone in  Modern Orthodox circles in recent years. Instead of serving as final arbiter,  rabbinic authorities nowadays often function in a manner similar to that of  professionals in many other fields who are called upon to offer their expertise  with regard to relevant data, leaving it to their clients to draw the final conclu- sion. Along with the gradual decentralization of halakhic authority and the  diminishing of its enforcement powers, the disinclination of Modern Orthodox  Jews to rely exclusively upon the discretion of a sole authority figure indicates  the increasing role that the community is destined to play in the determination  of halakhic matters. In light of the potentially anarchic ramifications of this situation, I feel that Hart- man’s critique of reactionary rabbinic backlash—while understandable—still  191 </page> <page sequence="8"> Tamar Ross leaves something wanting. Feminist vigilance is indeed critical in making it  clear that halakhic discussion can no longer be framed in terms reminiscent  of male-only locker-room concepts. But while the attitude Hartman displays  toward the rabbis who are the object of her attack is admittedly no more sar- castic or antagonistic than the rhetoric they themselves employ in addressing  feminist concerns, the extremity of their polemic language and their resort to  arguments that are not strictly halakhic indicate the degree of their distress,  as she herself point out. As such, she, too, recognizes that this phenomenon  deserves further scrutiny. What is it that drives ordinarily civil people and even  saintly and dedicated religious leaders, who as a rule, in their personal lives,  deeply value and respect their wives and daughters, and who in general are not  hungry power seekers, to react so violently to feminist agitation for change? In Chapter 6, Hartman offers three issues for analysis in this connection:  the debates regarding women’s suffrage, women’s tefilah groups, and women’s  public reading of documents at the wedding ceremony; and the respective  responses of Rabbi A.I. Kook, Rabbis Meiselman and Twersky, and Rabbi  Hershel Schachter. Hartman concludes that in all these cases, the suggestion  of changes is perceived as expressing “a deeper dissatisfaction with the scope  and/or content of women’s assigned roles, an implication that the traditional  norms are no longer meeting a community’s needs and must be renegotiated”  (p. 119–120). One may note, in this connection, that there are many reasons for differenti- ating between the attitudes of Rabbi Kook regarding the issue of women’s suf- frage and those of Meiselman, Twersky and Schachter regarding the feminist  issues to which they relate. On the one hand, the less advanced social status  of women in R. Kook’s times, his predominantly east European background,  and his mystical views regarding the nature of femininity more understandably  predispose him to a reactionary stance. The essentialist attitude of (generally  benign) paternalism that he displays towards women as a class also differs in  kind from the demonization and disdain that the Modern Orthodox rabbis  in question reserve for the feminists in their midst. Moreover, although R.  Kook brings extra-halakhic arguments in support of his opposition to grant- ing women political suffrage, the question of women’s involvement in politics,  unlike the issues of women’s tefilah groups and of their public reading of the  marriage contract, is arguably an issue regarding which strictly halakhic argu- ments can be brought to bear. On the other hand, R. Kook’s philosophy of hal- akhah is far more responsive in principle to the vicissitudes of life and history,  192 • Nashim 17 (2009) </page> <page sequence="9"> Tova Hartman: Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism as evidenced in his willingness to view the events triggering the evolution of  human understanding and moral sensibilities, and the rabbinic interpretations  that inevitably develop in their wake, as another form of ongoing revelation.  On the surface, this would make the prospect of facing traditional norms  that no longer meet current needs far less daunting for him than for the other  rabbis that Hartman cites, who are all influenced by the Soloveitchikian school  regarding the fixed, metaphysical nature of halakhah.4 The disparity between R. Kook’s ostensibly liberal and fluid ideology and  his more reactionary decisions with regard to various questions of practical  halakhah has been the subject of much debate and deserves separate discussion  beyond the scope of this review.5 But as for the other three rabbis, who have  in common a Westernized background and sociological allegiance to Modern  Orthodoxy, the threat that they sense in the feminist challenge to tradition is  one that even contemporary religious feminists must to some extent share.  Can continuity be maintained between a religious sensibility that is based on  subjective experience and one that claims grounding in objective, immutable  truths? Once the bubble of objectivity is burst, and rabbinic authority chal- lenged, what is to serve as the final arbiter of religious practice? Are “com- mitment, habit, sentiment or faithfulness to a [subjective] experience of truth”  (factors that Hartman cites in the name of Peter Berger) sufficient justification  for religious behavior? Although Hartman speaks of the “positive spiritual  framework” lacking in feminism (p. 3), is her conclusion that she is destined  to live in a “permanent state of dissatisfaction” (ibid.), because the dictates of a  patriarchal tradition and the vision of feminism are ultimately irreconcilable, a  viable theological stance? Is remaining within a male-oriented tradition, simply  because the prospect of leaving it is too costly, a spiritual legacy sufficiently  compelling for future generations? I am all too aware that once one has partaken of “the forbidden fruit” there  is no going back, yet one can still appreciate the recoil of those who wish  to avoid the deeply troubling questions raised for traditionalists by feminist  analysis, despite its ethical and spiritual promise. Hartman has offered us an  excellent analysis of the dilemmas that feminism poses for traditionalist Jews,  a sharp and persuasive critique of some of the more reactionary responses, and  important guidelines for a more nuanced and textured approach that recognizes  the futility of turning our backs on a religious past in which our personal and  cultural identities are inextricably rooted. Yet this still leaves feminists who are  on the cutting edge of Orthodoxy with the difficult task of developing reliable  193 </page> <page sequence="10"> Tamar Ross criteria for the choices they make, and investing them with the sincere fervor  typifying more simplistic traditionalist views. Hartman offers a rudimentary basis for establishing such criteria in her  many references to the need for respecting human dignity. Indeed, this concept  (which is by no means foreign to halakhic discourse) is increasingly being  called upon as the basis for revising some classic halakhic rulings with regard  to women, particularly in the synagogue context.6 However, there is much fine- tuning to be done even on this score: If the broad-brush principle of human  dignity can be called upon in support of women’s aliyot, why stop at this?  Surely synagogue meḥitzot are no less an affront to women’s dignity. Moreover,  Rabbi Moshe Feinstein’s formulations notwithstanding,7 the obligation to erect  an actual physical barrier separating the sexes for prayer purposes can just as  easily be categorized as a rabbinic (rather than biblical) injunction, carrying  no greater legal weight than that against women’s aliyot. Obviously, there are  more than formal legalistic factors at work here, and these need to be spelled  out and assessed.8 As for retaining the uncomplicated passion of religious innocence, this issue  is broader than feminism, affecting all Modern Orthodox adherents who have  been bitten by the bugs of historical analysis, textual criticism, metaphysical  agnosticism (or more precisely, under-determinism) and the like. I include  myself in this group, and I therefore agree with Hartman’s perception that “the  religious spirit cannot be boiled down to a set of doctrines or practices” and  “is more than the sum of its commitments and beliefs” (p. 2). This is a vital  first step in addressing the issue. I am nevertheless doubtful as to whether this  observation will suffice, and whether Hartman’s general recognition of the  “positive spiritual framework” that Judaism affords will be capable of coexist- ing for long with the “permanent state of dissatisfaction” that she envisions as  her lot. With all due respect to the pull of cultural identity, it is questionable  whether any firm attachment to feminism is capable of bearing the brunt of  more than one generation’s cognitive dissonance with its religious legacy, in  the absence of a more compelling rationale. Hartman quite rightly enlists the  feminist insight that “our lives and choices are not made within a vacuum”  (p. 124) but rather governed by relationships and context, in order to counter  the “Western myth of individualism, self-sufficiency and unlimited agency”  (ibid.) and its accompanying demand that these “so-called Orthodox” feminist  troublemakers should simply “go away” and change whatever they like. Never- theless this psychological and sociological understanding that we are not—after  194 • Nashim 17 (2009) </page> <page sequence="11"> Tova Hartman: Feminism Encounters Traditional Judaism all is said and done—totally free agents, requires a more carefully worked out  theological supplement. Although it is perfectly true that we are governed by  deeply rooted personal relationships, even these require bolstering from time  to time in a more objectivized mode of support. This is especially true in the  religious context, which is fraught with the history of believers’ struggles to  formulate an ideological basis strong enough to sustain the degree of intensity  requisite for true and long-lasting commitment. Reviewers are often guilty of relating to their own agendas rather than  to the objectives of the book in hand. I would not like to be faulted on this  score, so let me first sum up by saying that. Hartman’s candid treatment of the  Orthodox feminist’s dilemma, and her sharp phrasing of the problems it raises  for conventional notions of Modern Orthodoxy, are a refreshing spur to new  thinking. Her account of the broader issues surrounding the establishment of  Shira Ḥadasha underscores her conviction that the significance of the feminist  movement to Orthodoxy cannot be relegated to the sphere of power politics and  halakhic debates regarding the feasibility of egalitarianism within a traditional  framework. Instead, it offers a forceful critique of the narrowness and moral  inadequacy of several prevailing views and attitudes of Modern Orthodoxy and  indicates some of the more spiritual contributions that feminism can offer the  religious mind-set of men and women alike. But Hartman’s book also raises  the question of whether her proposed method of selective reinterpretation is  any the less vulnerable to charges of inconsistency than are the policies of the  more conservative traditionalists that serve as the object of her critique. One is  also led to wonder whether her approach can, on its own, compete with theirs  in maintaining a perceived sense of continuity with the Jewish past. In light  of these questions, I would suggest that her own statement that “the work of  re-engaging tradition is necessarily a work in progress,” one in which “there  may never be a sweeping resolution, an exhalation of relief, an oceanic sense  of oneness” (p. 3), should be regarded as an impetus for further halakhic and  theological effort of a more comprehensive nature. However Sisyphean this  effort may be, such a project must strive for greater rigor and coherence in the  struggle to accommodate a variegated range of views and ways of living a life  of Torah within a traditionalist framework. 195 </page> <page sequence="12"> Tamar Ross Notes: 1.

In this connection, I am reminded of a class I once gave on the challenge of femi- nism to Jewish tradition under the aegis of Bar Ilan University’s Midrasha, which  caters exclusively to religiously observant female students. When speaking about  some of the disadvantages religious feminists cite today in their religious education, I  mentioned the lack they sense of palpable reminders of their Jewish identity, unlike the  situation of men who cover their heads with a kippah and wear tzitzit (ritual fringes).  The overwhelming reaction of my students was: “But of course we have comparable  practices; if men have kippot and tzitzit, we have the laws of tzeni’ut (modesty)!” 3.
