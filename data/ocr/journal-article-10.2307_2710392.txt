<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE M. FREDRICKSON A lexandria, Virginia Thorstein Veblen: The Last Viking TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN RADICALS OF THE 1930's, THORSTEIN VEBLEN WAS A kind of patron saint. He was a home-grown social theorist whose ironic thrusts at American capitalism seemed to grow more and more relevant in the chaos of depression. Every shade of leftist opinion could find some- thing to admire in Veblen. To a radical individualist like the Dos Passos of U.S.A., Veblen was a spiritual father. To the technocrats, his vision of an aristocracy of engineers provided the basis of a new programme. To orthodox Marxists, his analysis seemed close enough to Marxism to be generally acceptable. Perhaps few of these young radicals read the prolific writings of Veblen with great care; it was not necessary; many of his insights were common currency. Everybody was talking about "conspicu- ous consumption," "captains of industry," "robber barons" and even "pecuniary canons of taste." Veblen's odd but striking terminology pro- vided many battle cries for the age. Today, however, reading Veblen is necessarily a different experience. The dust of battle has settled, and Veblen's theories can be regarded for their own sake. David Riesman, hardly a radical, has taken some of Veb- len's most original and perceptive ideas and applied them with great success to contemporary society. He has been particularly interested in Veblen's belief that a great transformation has taken place in capitalism: the change in emphasis from production to consumption and the replace- ment of the "captain of industry" by the "captain of finance." This was a part of Veblen's doctrine that did not greatly interest the 1930's. In his study of Veblen's ideas (Thorstein Veblen, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953), David Riesman has recognized the unique qualities of Veblen's thought. He has recognized implicitly that Veblen's ideas are substantially different from other theorists of his time to whom superficial similarities might be drawn-men like Ely, Ward, Dewey or Beard. Ries-</page><page sequence="2">404 A merican Quarterly man is not concerned with the origins of Veblen's peculiarities; he seeks the value in the ideas themselves. He does suggest, however, that Veblen's quality of detachment, his role as an impersonal observer is related to his background as the son of a Norwegian immigrant. He summarizes his rudimentary study of the importance of Veblen's social background in the following manner: One can hardly emphasize enough Veblen's marginality as a second- generation Norwegian, put off and alienated from the parents' parochial culture but without the ability fully to assimilate and accept the available forms of Americanism.' Veblen's detached "scientific" analysis is regarded by Riesman as a result of his cultural isolation. Useful and suggestive as this insight is, it does not explain in any way the origins of the set of ideas that Veblen held to with such stubborn consistency. To say, as Veblen's biographer Joseph Dorfman does, that they arise from the general climate of "progressive" opinion, is to ignore such strange anomalies for a "progressive" thinker as an apparent lack of concern for the future of the working class, a lack of faith in government action and an obvious dislike of capitalism accom- panied by a paradoxical refusal to call himself a socialist. These anomalies in Veblen's thought must be explained before he can be located in Ameri- can intellectual history. Furthermore, while Riesman's "alienation" and "marginality" are valid and important considerations they do not explain Veblen's rigid dogmatism. Veblen's theories all rest on preconceived assumptions about society and economy. From the publication of his first book, The Theory of the Leisure Class in 1899, until his death in 1929, these assumptions remained unaltered despite the rapidity of social change and the growth of a new body of economic and social thought. Dorfman gives numerous instances of Veblen's absolute refusal to provide a rational defense for his basic premises.2 Were his theories the speculations of a completely free-ranging and detached intellect? It seems unlikely that such an open mind would be so rigid in adherence to a set of doctrines which cannot be proved empirically, nor refuse to re-evaluate and modify them in the course of a lifetime. The Veblenian view of the world would seem to be partly the result of inherited and acquired cultural assumptions. To discover the nature of these assumptions, it is useful to examine Veblen's formative years-the years before he left the family farm at the age of seventeen. 1 David Riesman, Thorstein Veblen (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953), p. 206. 2 Joseph Dorfman, Thorstein Veblen and his America (New York: Viking Press, 1934).</page><page sequence="3">Thorstein Veblen: The Last Viking 405 Thorstein Veblen was born on an eighty-acre farm in Wisconsin in 1857. His father and mother had come to America ten years before, flee- ing a depression in Norway. They both came from long lines of bonder, the proud class of independent farmers. Owing to a misfortune in the previous generation, both families had lost their farms. In Norway, land (the basis of life) was very scarce indeed. Those fortunate enough to own their own farms had a position of dignity and responsibility. Farms often had remained in a single family for a thousand years, due partly to a rigid set of laws which made it difficult to sell outside the family. The family name was taken from the ancient farm name, and had to be abandoned if the family lost possession of the land.3 Both of Thorstein Veblen's grandfathers had fallen into debt and been forced to sell their property outside the family. When this happened-as it did with the Veb- lens-the family name remained attached to the farm and could no longer be used by its former owners. The legal name of Veblen's father was Thomas Andersen; he was not of the bonde class and could no longer use the place name. In a similar manner, his mother had been legally named Kari Thorsteindatter. She was unable to use the original family name of Bunde. When the "Veblens" or Andersens came to America and again became landowners, Thomas felt justified in assuming the Veblen name once more. This signifies a sense of having regained bonde status of being able to live the life and maintain the ideals of the Norwegian bonde. The scheme of things was still that of the self-sufficient homestead of rural Norway. The homes of the immigrants were usually log cabins . . . pioneer housewives made cheese, churned butter, baked bread, boiled soap, carded wool, spun yarn, wove cloth, sewed clothes. Homemade food, furniture, and garments were customary.4 Self-sufficiency and economy were characteristics of the bonde in Nor- way. He felt that his independence would be compromised by a complex market economy with its treacherous credit system. Isak in Knut Ham- sun's novel, Growth of the Soil, exemplifies the stiffnecked and freedom loving bonde. Hamsun's work is an attempt to re-assert the traditional agrarian values against the rise of commercial society in Norway. It repre- sents the primitive bonde, Isak, as a self-sufficient farmer with a belief in strict economy and an intense hatred of money society. There are many similarities between Isak and Veblen's father. Both became prosperous 3 Magnus Olsen, Farms and Fanes of Ancient Norway (Oslo: Aschehoug, 1928), p. 30. 4Dorfman, Thorstein Veblen and his America, p. 6.</page><page sequence="4">406 A merican Quarterly through hard work, and neither yielded to the temptations of speculation. In 1860, Thomas Veblen was the owner of three horses, five cows, two working oxen, four other cattle, eighteen sheep and five swine.5 Both Isak and Veblen, Sr. while remaining hostile to the credit and market struc- ture, were more modern than some of their neighbors. They welcomed the introduction of farm machinery as long as it could be bought without going heavily into debt. Independence could be enhanced rather than destroyed by improvement in agricultural techniques. The innovations in the system of distribution were seen as a more direct threat to the farmer's independence. Thorstein Veblen grew up in this kind of environment and with this heritage. His isolation from American society was almost as great as if he had lived in Norway. There was little fraternization with native Ameri- cans. "Yankees" were encountered only in necessary business relations. Thomas Veblen scrupulously kept out of community affairs and hardly participated in American life. He never learned the English language. He brought a Norwegian tutor into the family to teach the rudiments of Norwegian language and literature to the children.6 When Veblen left the farm, he was, in a sense, emigrating to America. When Thorstein Veblen was eight years old, the family moved to a prairie farm in Minnesota with two hundred and ninety acres. On this farm he grew to adolescence. He was recognized from his earliest years as an unusual child. He often got into fights and played jokes on people; but his most pronounced quality seemed to be laziness. Like many farm boys, Thorstein disliked farm work. He apparently admired his father and his prodigious capacity to plow the earth and bind the sheaves, but he himself preferred to read in the hayloft or tinker with his father's new two-horsepower thresher. "Farm tasks were not irksome to him" Dorfman reports, "when he could operate machinery . . . He had a highly developed sense of economy of effort."7 His exultation in the new harvester is similar to the joy of Hamsun's Isak when the new mowing machine is introduced. Thorstein Veblen had a very high mechanical aptitude and throughout his life enjoyed working with machinery. When he was seventeen years old, his father suddenly decided to send him to college. In a characteristic way, he summoned his son from the fields and sent him off in a buggy without telling him his destination. When the trip was over, Thorstein found himself at Carleton College in Northfield, Mlnnesota. 5Dorfman, Thorstein Veblen Add his America, p. 6. "Ibid., p. 8. "Ibid., p. 12.</page><page sequence="5">Thorstein Veblin: The Last Viking 407 To understand the effect of Veblen's family heritage on the world view of his economic theory, it is helpful to note ehe importance in his works of bondekultur-the complex of agrarian values and attitudes that his father had brought from Norway and introduced to his children. In an essay entitled the "Independent Farmer," he refers obliquely to "the Independent Farmer of the poets" to make a distinction between the American farmer and this mythical figure.8 He is more specific in his note on North European pre-history in Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution. In describing medieval Scandinavian society, he examines the system of agriculture. Typically the farm is of relatively large size and with a large equip- ment, sufficient to take care of its own needs in all necessary lines of industry . . . All classes of men took part in the work, there appar- ently being no leisure class . . . the freehold farm population (bonder) ... appear to have been . . . the main body of the com- munity considered as a civil society.9 He goes on to describe the extraordinary independence and freedom of the bonder. So far as bears on the relations between man and man . . . anar- chistic morality is formulated in homely aphorism: live and let live. A man . . . is to do his work in his own way to the limit of such capacity as there is in him-always with the reservation that he will not transgress the margin of tolerance rooted in the moral common sense of his neighbors .... Settled and persistent disserviceability is morally odious . . . and so falls under the corrective intervention of common sense as soon as it swells to such excess as to stir the neigh- borhood into action. Evidently what has been called "the instinct of workmanship" comes in for a large share in this moral bias.'0 Isak in Growth of the Soil, which takes place in Norway in the nineteenth century, moves in accordance with what Veblen calls "this anarchistic morality." This morality has a close relation to values implicit in bonde- kultur. Generations of Norwegian farmers had been bred with such a morality-a morality which made them resist the encroachments of the s Thorstein Veblen, Absentee Ownership (New York: Huebsch, 1923), p. 130. 9 Thorstein Veblen, Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (New York: Viking Press, 1939), pp. 311-12. 10 Ibid., p. 329.</page><page sequence="6">408 A merican Quarterly government or the business classes of the city with equal vehemence.11 Veblen was expressing more than the ethical system of the medieval b6nder. He was defining the assumptions which the Norwegian rural com- munity had preserved almost intact for a thousand years. Veblen never lost contact with Norwegian culture. He regularly read Scandinavian newspapers. His hobby was translating Icelandic Sagas, and observers have noticed that his books often follow the saga's structural pattern.12 He would often assume a thick Norwegian accent when he wished to impress visitors to his classes. Norwegian was his first language, and his style of writing sometimes has the peculiar quality of a literal translation from the Norwegian. Of course, it is an injustice to Veblen to see him operating strictly within an inherited pattern of thinking. He should be seen as a man whose theories are partially the result of the values of his people. No idea springs full blown: it must be a combination of the freedom of the individual mind and the operation of traditional dispositions. It is clear that Veblen learned to despise the business classes of the town at an early age. His writings about the country town indicate an antago- nism toward the "parasitic" system of credit and distribution. Veblen's love of machinery and his hatred for the waste and "cupidity" of the town merchants (with whom his father had to deal) forced him in the direction of a fundamental distinction between business and industry. He accepted machinery because it could be applied directly to productive effort and might actually increase independence. Every man continued to "do his own work in his own way." Veblen was clearly emancipated from the superstitions and animistic outlook of the bonde toward nature. The Norwegian rural culture had a traditional interpretation of nature which made mysterious forces intelli- gible by giving them human qualities. This is related to what Veblen called "the pre-industrial animus." An emancipation from animism was the source of Veblen's intellectual freedom. Of the old ideas, this one falls the easiest. It cannot survive education. Veblen makes this clear in his essay on "Science in Modern Civilization." The machine process had replaced the workman as the archetype in whose image causation is conceived by the scientific investigators. The dramatic interpretation of natural phenomena has thereby be- come less anthropomorphic.13 11 See Karen Larsen, History of Norway (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1948), pp. 332-34.

Hamsun stated the traditional position. We seldom reflect on the strangeness of the fact that the modern working man has few or no superstitions . . . he lives without awe, without fear, without admiration. Whatever we may think about these beliefs, it is not natural for men to be without them. The life of the town artisan who works in a factory is a life to which the human organism has not adapted itself; it is an unwholesome and unnatural condition.'4 Hamsun perceived the growing impersonalization of the industrial proc- ess, but unlike Veblen, he did not hail it. In the name of primitive agrari- anism, he contended that the machine would destroy the human soul. The real revolt of Veblen was his acceptance of science and his rejection of the animistic interpretation of nature. Despite his escape from the bonde's animism, Veblen's ideas were con- ditioned by the bonde's set of values. His belief in economy as an end in itself, his desire for self-sufficiency of individual producers, and his insist- ence on "ownership for use," bear the stamp of bondekultur.15 The fact that effort was required from everyone on the farm was a stimulus to condemning "leisure classes." His famous defense of "workmanship" against "wastemanship" in society has its origins in the bonde's necessity and desire to make use of all available resources on his homestead. The traditional bonde had an almost pathological hostility to waste. One of the things that disturbed Veblen about the industrial proletariat was that they had no sense of thrift. They lived in a society which accepted con- spicuous waste and they could not help emulating the leisure classes. Veblen's moral indignation was at its highest when he discussed "con- spicuous consumption" and other forms of waste. The good bonde worked his own land, receiving his award from the direct application of effort. Veblen condemned "absentee ownership" in all forms, extending the principle from the ownership of land to the ownership of industry. He attacked the absentee landlords, whom the bonder had fought in Nor- 14 Jorgenson and Solum, Ole Edvart R5lvaag (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1939), p. 53. 15For a survey of the rural values of Norway, in English, see David Rodnick, The Norwegians (Washington, D.C.: Public Affairs Press, 1955), p. 75 et seq. 16 Thorstein Veblen, Theory of Business Enterprize (New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1906), pp. 324-26.</page><page sequence="8">410 American Quarterly way,17 and saw the financiers as absentee owners of industry. The engi- neers like the bonder were directly concerned with producing; the finan- ciers like the city-dwelling landlords were concerned only with profiting from the efforts of others. Veblen's belief that a "soviet of engineers" should be in control of industry is clearly analogous to a belief that the farmers should be in control of agriculture rather than rich burghers who lived in the towns and owned land in the country. "The captain of finance" did not produce, but actually limited production, Veblen thought, by his manipulations of the artificial financial systems which he had set up to insure his profits. The Norwegian farmer had always felt that banks and credit systems were the work of the devil. Hjalmar Boye- sen, the Norwegian-American novelist of the nineteenth century, describes in a short story, "A Dangerous Virtue," a bonde who comes to America and puts his small inheritance in a bank. When the bank fails in a financial crisis, he refuses to be put off by explanations about the "sys- tem." In accordance with his "anarchistic morality," he takes his quarrel directly to the president of the bank whom he attacks physically. Veblen was hardly less violent, advocating a "revolution" by the engineers. According to his view, the price system resulted in waste and absentee ownership.18 Most important perhaps in understanding Veblen's thought is a recog- nition of his own servitude to what he called the "anarchistic morality" of the bonder. This morality is characteristic of yeoman farmers in any nation at any time. Cr~vecoeur saw it in America in the eighteenth cen- tury. It involves a resistance to external authority and a corresponding belief in moral suasion by the community to maintain a traditional sys- tem of ethics. In both his life and writings Veblen was something of an anarchist, yet he had his definition of moral behavior. This morality could be enforced by a body of equals acting together without hierarchic control. Industry could be run by a soviet of engineers without manage- ment; universities could be run by a council of professors without a presi- dent.19 He stood for masterless groups of individuals who are direct par- ticipants in the fundamental process in question and who can come to spontaneous agreement. Engineers, he thought, would all have the moral sense to eliminate waste and chicanery. To understand the genesis of Veblen's "political" theory, it is useful to recall that the only ruling bodies 17 For an account of landlord-bonde struggle in Norway, see Knute Gjerset, A History of the Norwegian People~ (New York: Macmillan Co., 1927), II, 278. 18 Thorstein Veblen, The Engiijeers and the Price System (New York: Huebsch, 1921). 19 Thorstein Veblen, Higher Learning in America (New York: Huebsch, 1918).</page><page sequence="9">Thorstein Veblen: The Last Viking 411 traditionally acceptable to the bonder were the councils known as Tings in which each freeholder had an equal voice. The ting was one means of enforcing the "anarchistic morality." Veblen adapted the spirit of the ting for use in modern society. In distinguishing Veblen from conventional socialists, it is significant that he accepts the necessity of underlings. The Norwegian bonde knew that there had to be cotters and servants. In the same spirit, Veblen recog- nized that the workers themselves could not run industry; it had to be done by the master technicians-the engineers. In Norway, a man had to own land to participate in a ting; maintenance of land implied com- petence as a farmer, the ability to keep the family farm intact. In industry, the competence of an engineer makes him eligible to participate in the ruling council. Veblen seemed indifferent to the welfare of the workers. He wished to prevent waste by establishing a virtual aristocracy of engineers. His views are not based on the presuppositions of welfare socialism which is the product of nineteenth-century humanitarianism. They stem from an inherited hatred of waste and a fervent belief that the producer himself should be independent of the system of distribution, that the act of pro- ducing-whether it be industrial or agricultural-is the essential part of the economic structure. Veblen's life, as well as his thought, takes on new shades of meaning when considered in the light of his cultural roots. Veblen had a great admiration for the Vikings of the pre-Christian era. He describes this ancient society in an essay called "An Early Experiment in Trusts" and speaks of it again in his introduction to The Laxedala Saga, which he translated into English. Viking enterprise began as a diversion for the b6nder. "These Vikings farmed during the winter and the object of their adventures was to acquire a competence in order to live as 'country gentlemen' on the farm. "20 The early republic in Iceland, he relates, was formed of independent bonder who voluntarily joined in companies on the basis of equality to go on piratical expeditions (similar to the "soviet of engineers"). This, according to Veblen, was a period of vitality and high spirits. He indicates that there were some who did not return to the farm but became permanent wanderers and pirates. In an essay entitled "An Experiment in Eugenics" he points to the Viking wanderers as great colonizers in the second of his "three great Scandinavian migrations."'2' As the raiding became a larger and more expensive operation, the com- 20Dorfman, Thorstein and his America, p. 240. 21Thorstein Veblen, "An Experiment in Eugenics," Essays in Our Changing Order, ed. Leon Adzrooni (New York: Viking Press, 1934).</page><page sequence="10">412 American Quarterly panies became more tightly organized and a few individuals took over. The common run of bonder were frozen out of control and profit. As competition developed between these enterprises, monopolies with great power began to emerge. Veblen sardonically points out that the stage was set for Christianity, because the people had lost their independence to the great trading monopolies and their servility made them ripe for church domination. He attempts to demonstrate that the officials of the early church were closely related to the great trusts; the captains of piracy joined with the "captains of Christianity" to deny freedom to the b6nder. This analysis is of greater importance in the study of Veblen than it is in the study of Scandinavian history. Veblen himself can be compared to the early Viking who left his farm to be a raider and wanderer. Like the characters in the Sagas, he left his farm and put out to sea. The figure of the Viking wanderer has its counterpart in the literature of Norway in the constant procession of vagabonds and wandering poets who have a temperamental aversion to farm work and a vague longing for a new existence, although they have no social and economic notions in opposition to the prevailing beliefs. They have an irrepressible tend- ency to dream of faraway lands and drift around the countryside getting into trouble. Bjornson's Arne and Ibsen's Per Gynt are men whose sense of destiny makes them want to wander "over the mountain high." In Ham- sun's Growth of the Soil, Geissler, the surveyor, is a man who has a strong attachment to the life of the soil, but whose education and temperament make him a drifter who appears and reappears, wandering off to Sweden to escape the law, or disappearing just as he stands to make a fortune from his lands. He is a man who cannot remain rooted, despite his knowledge that land is the substantial reality and that a man's true destiny is in belonging to the land. These figures are analogous to the drifters in the American west- frontiersmen and cowboys. They are people who will commit themselves to nothing; all entanglements are avoided. In this spirit, Per Gynt refuses to marry the girl whom he once loved madly and whom he has made pregnant, when he realizes that marriage will condemn him to the settled existence of his ancestors. In Norwegian communities in America there were many such figures. Ole Rdlvaag, the Norwegian-American novelist, describes in his Boat of Longing how a young immigrant comes to America with great dreams and becomes an itinerant laborer. The man who is unable or unwilling to become a bonde in America often becomes a handyman. The figure of the Scandinavian handyman was familiar in</page><page sequence="11">Thorstein Veblen: The Last Viking 413 the Middle-West. Bjornstam, the handyman df Gopher Prairie in Sinclair Lewis' Main Street, is a good example. There was a strong element of the rural vagabond in Veblen's psy- chology. Several incidents in his life indicate this recognizable combination of freedom and irresponsibility. He dressed coarsely, was rude and unpre- dictable in his behavior and was a great practical joker. The story of Per Gynt's putting his mother up on the roof is more than matched by a story which is told about Veblen as an old man. Veblen was out for a walk one day and found a hornets' nest by the side of the road. Soon afterward, he met a farmer and borrowed an empty sack from him. He returned quickly to where he had found the nest, put it in the sack and returned it to the farmer. The farmer (from all accounts) is still looking for Veblen.22 Veblen never liked to stay too long in one place. Wherever he taught, he made few close friends. Although he married twice, he did not allow marriage to impair his freedom. His attitude toward both of his wives was irresponsible. He spent a year at Cornell without his wife. When he brought her to the campus, his friends were amazed to learn that he was married.23 Veblen's extramarital love affairs became famous; he was apparently irresistible to women. The second marriage was more harmonious because the new wife was more attracted to "Veblenism" than to Veblen. She was too busy giving her children (by another mar- riage) an education which would encourage "the instinct of workman- ship" and discourage "conspicuous consumption" to appreciate what a bad husband Veblen really was.24 His refusal to conform to accepted procedures is illustrated by his habit of giving all his students "C"s. He would not commit himself to the point of evaluating a student's work. He refused to edit his writings for publi- cation. The most flagrant example of his irresponsible refusal to involve himself was his unwillingness to take a position in politics or support any political or social movement. Nowhere is his perverse irresponsibility better exemplified than in his fleeing into the woods near Columbia, Mis- souri, in order to avoid voting for a friend who was running for the city council.25 Like Bjornstam, the "red Swede" of Lewis' Main Street, Veblen lived on the edge of town and criticized the existing order. Veblen never joined a political party, took a stand on public issues or even voted. His 2aRiesman, Thorstein Veblen, p. 23. 23Dorfman, Thorstein Veblen and his America, p. 85. 24Ibid. 25 Ibid., p. 309.</page><page sequence="12">414 A merican Quarterly books touched on issues of the time so that they could be used for propa- ganda by the liberals and the socialists, yet contained no commitment to any specific course of action beyond his quixotic revolution of engineers-a cause as remote from possibility as it was from the minds of the reformers. Veblen liked to talk in general anthropological terms without limiting himself to a single society and its problems. One of his great unfulfilled desires was to go on an anthropological expedition to Crete. He could talk as sarcastically about medieval aristocrats as about the leisure class of his own time. "Robber barons" of any period were the same. Veblen was described by one of his students in the following manner: His detached, free-ranging intellect attracted, and yet it seemed a mutilated personality . . . in the main one found the margin from economic shaping not too large . . . . The whole effect was towards criticism, skepticism of watchwords, fine sentiment, prides, preju- dices, no passion of hope or preference . . . just a remorseless massing of facts that drove home the plasticity of the human mind under economic facts, however free it fancied itself. I think we Middle Westerners recognized in him a real citizen of the world.26 As we have seen, Veblen did have "prejudices" and "preferences." His "facts" were more like theories. One can find few actual facts (statistics or concrete examples) in his writings; we scarcely know on what evidence his general statements are based. But Veblen did wish to give the impres- sion that he was objective and outside the society in which he lived. He was trying to show that he was an intellectual man of the world by speak- ing of trusts in the tenth-century Iceland as well as in twentieth-century America; the "leisure class" to him was a general phenomena and not uniquely a part of any culture and time. Veblen showed how tenuous and assumed this position of detached scientific observation really is, when he stated in Absentee Ownership that he intended no value judgment about the "self-made man" after he had just lambasted him in the strongest terms.27 Why did Veblen put on this mask of complete objectivity and uni- versality? His ideas had a real application to the struggles that were going on in America at the time he wrote. They came in part from the inherited values of the Norwegian community reinforced by emotional reaction to American conditions; they were not the result of impersonal observation. Why, then, the mask? 26 Riesman, Thorstein Veblen, p. 14. -' Thorstein Veblen, Absentee Ownership (New York: Huebsch, 1923), chap. vii.</page><page sequence="13">Thorstein Veblen: The Last Viking 415 Veblen was a sort of Norwegian chauvinist, yet he made few specific references to the Norwegian community in America. When he spoke about Middle-Western farmers it was a case study, presented in the same way he might have presented a study of ancient Crete. H1is agrarianism was also played down, although the bonde attitude dominated his work. Veblen was seeking an escape from his provincial background. He was the product of emigration from a provincial nation to the nineteenth- century provinces of America. He could not completely escape the in- herited patterns of thinking, but he could gain the satisfaction of partial escape by abstracting some of these ideas and giving them universal appli- cation. His revolt against American provincialism as well as his recog- nition of his heritage, led him to assume a mask of absolute scientific detachment. He was caught between two cultures, Norwegian and Ameri- can, and he could not identify himself with either. Both attracted and repelled. America was a great industrial nation yet it was dominated by the "wastemanship" of the "self-made man." In Norway, a "sense of work- manship" survived to some extent, but it was accompanied by animistic, pre-industrial ways of thinking. Like the Viking wanderer, Veblen could never settle down and consciously say "I choose this way of life and main- tain these values." This attitude did not prevent him from maintaining values, but it did give his work that peculiar flavor of half-conscious irony and deception which makes it so interesting and perplexing.</page></plain_text>
