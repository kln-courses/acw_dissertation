<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TRANSFORMATION OF A LANDSCAPE: CULTURE AND ECOLOGY IN SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA Paul Hirt University of Arizona Soujtheastern Arizona hosts one of the most unique and ecologically diverse landscapes in America. It is the meeting place of four major North American bioregions: the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts, and the Rocky Mountain and Sierra Madrean forests. Each of these reaches the limits of its range in southeastern Arizona. The mountains and valleys here contain a rich, unparalleled mix of plant and animal species, attracting the attention of biologists from all over the world.' In the past one hundred years, however, the landscape has undergone significant changes, both physically and culturally, Following United States acquisition of this territory in 1853 (the Gadsden Purchase), Anglo-Americans slowly but steadily established hegemony over the land and its indigenous inhabitants, the Chiricahua Apache, displacing both a culture and an ecology. Coveting the rich natural resources, armed with powerful technologies, and motivated by a belief in their destiny to conquer and civilize the wilderness, the new American culture occupied and radically transformed the landscape. Scientists now judge the huge scale of ecological alterations that occurred in southern Arizona during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as comparable in scope to those that occurred during the late pleistocene.2 From almost any perspective these changes proved undesirable: An indigenous people lost their land and way of life; a healthy, stable environment deteriorated; and the natural resource productivity of the land significantly declined. Climatic factors played some role (the region's climate appears to have become</page><page sequence="2">168 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER slightly warmer and drier3), but primarily these transformations resulted from human actions. Mining, farming, and livestock grazing wrought the greatest changes on this sensitive, arid environment; while hunting, trapping, fire suppression, and urbanization compounded their effects. The transformation of the southeast Arizona landscape can be described as an ecological response to the particular institutions, ideologies, and modes of production of the intruding Anglo- American society. For example, overgrazing in southeast Arizona in the 1880's and 1890s, which had a profound impact on the grasslands, occurred as a combined effect of enhanced market opportunities, speculative capital investments, the railway transportation revolution, U. S. federal land policies, and an Anglo-American value system that encouraged personal wealth accumulation and adopted a materialist, utilitarian view of the natural world. In contrast, the previous ecological make-up of the landscape under Apache tenure reflected the small-scale social organization, nomadic lifestyle, animistic world view, and subsistence hunting and gathering economy of the Indian culture. While geographic and climatic factors establish the general parameters of ecological composition on this landscape, cultural elements provide the key to explaining specific historical conditions and the radical alterations that marked the late 19th century.4 Since the environmental problems consequent to this change in sovereignty reflect the newly occupying culture, they offer a useful opportunity for social critique. A view of the Apache culture and the pre-Anglo ecology of southeastern Arizona provides the comparative basis for a critical assessment of the subsequent ecological changes following the defeat and removal of the Apaches in the 1880s.5 The Apaches, a diffuse association of Athabascan speaking nomadic tribes, migrated out of the southern plains and arrived in the Southwest some time during the 16th and 17th centuries.6 A tribe that ethnologists later referred to as the "Chiricahuas" appropriated a large part of what is now southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northern portions of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua for their homeland. The Chiricahua tribe further divided into a number of local bands. One of them became known as the "true Chiricahua" or Chokonen in the Apache language.7 This was the well-known band of Cochise, responsible for so much of the frontier warfare in Arizona in the</page><page sequence="3">1989 PAUL HIRT 169 mid-19th century. Although the Chokonen roamed over a much larger area, as all Apaches did, the far southeast corner of Arizona became their home base. The Chokonen landscape lies between the San Pedro river forty miles east of present day Tucson and the San Simon river near the present border of New Mexico (see map). The geography is "basin and range": rugged mountains separated by wide valleys. Two major chains of mountains ranging north to south are the centerpiece of the Chokonen landscape. They are the rocky and semi-arid Dragoon mountains on the eastern edge of the San Pedro valley, and the massive, heavily forested Chiricahua mountains on the west end of the San Simon valley. The infamous "Cochise Stronghold" lies in the Dragoons, and Fort Bowie in "Apache Pass" lies at the northernmost extension of the Chiricahuas. The broad, grassy plain of the Sulphur Springs valley separates these two ranges. Surrounding the Dragoons and Chiricahuas are the smaller Dos Cabezas, Swisshelm, Guadalupe, and Mule mountains, also important to the Chokonen. Human occupation of this area was slight prior to the Apaches' arrival, so that the existing ecology had evolved primarily in response to natural forces. Beginning in the 16th century the Spanish, migrating up the river valleys from Mexico, established themselves in the Santa Cruz valley, and also attempted to settle the San Pedro valley on the edge of Chokonen territory. But Apache raiding led to rapid abandonment of ranches and missions in the San Pedro and even inhibited widespread settlement of the Santa Cruz. Thus, for several centuries the Apaches exclusively occupied all of the land east of the San Pedro and limited the spread of Hispanic culture on the periphery of their homeland. In order to fully understand the Indian occupation of the landscape, one must begin with the Apache world view. The integration of Indian belief systems into analyses of Indian environmental relations has some important historical precedents. Calvin Martin argued in Keepers of the Game that the Algonkian Indians' belief system formed "the absolutely crucial context" of their environmental perceptions. Similarly, Richard White has argued that cultural considerations are essential to an understanding of Pawnee environmental relations. Culture imbues the landscape with meaning, he says, and "in the Pawnee landscape, the practical and the sacred merged."8</page><page sequence="4">170 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER r A - - - - - - - MO _ U M E X I Colorado River /ARIZONA | NEW MERCOvr Tuc so SimG S i \~~~~~IVLE (Iocnit Rive IA Tombstone I MtJ ~ _ _ a Cruz R 1 Bisbocw ) SONORA MEXICO _i - - CHIHAHUA MEXICO \ /SnPedro R \ ~~~SPRINGS R w tW ~CMICA31UA]dW1 Tombstone \J(61i (0 l San Pedro Rivej r ARIZONA B MEXICO SONORA k CHIHUAHUA</page><page sequence="5">1989 PAUL HIRT 171 The mountains and valleys of southeastern Arizona served as more than a hunting ground for the Apaches, more than a base for village camps; these rugged ranges and grassy plains were central to Chokonen cultural identity. Chiricahua mythology reflected this crucial relationship between the Apaches and their native landscape. The mythic events leading to the emergence of the Apache people on the earth were said to have occurred on this very landscape. Indian informants in the ethnological texts dealing with the Chiricahua Apache have even identified specific places where key mythical events took place; such as Mescal mountain on the Arizona-New Mexico border, where the battle to bring light to the earth purportedly took place. In this context, the Indians viewed their homeland as the virtual center of their religious universe.9 Each band had their own sacred mountains, indeed each family group and each individual revered specific sacred places associated with some special feature of the landscape. Like most tribal peoples, the Chiricahua "anthropomorphized" their environment. They engaged in an active relationship with the plants, animals, and physical features of their landscape, blurring the boundaries between human and nonhuman worlds. They imbued everything with personality, purpose, and power. Coyotes, spiders, pollen (a sacred substance), and mountains were often accorded the same respect as neighbors and relatives. For the Apaches, the central motive force in this anthropomorphized environment was "power," the ability to interact with and affect the community of life on the landscape. As one Apache put it, "Power is everywhere. Everything has power."10 Since power inhered in all things, courtesy and respect characterized the Apache's relationship with nature. The Indians viewed plants and animals not as "natural resources," not as food or commodities, but as living beings with vitality and influence in the world. For example, when an Apache dug up a root for medicinal or ceremonial purposes, he or she prayed to the plant's spirit for both forgiveness and aid. On the evening before a hunt, hunters would send out prayers to the deer and antelope explaining their families' need for food. The next morning they would often embark without eating so that some prey might perceive their hunger and show pity by allowing itself to be caught." When offended or harmed, other species could use their power to retaliate. Certain animals, insects, or objects presented particular dangers, such as bears, owls, snakes, spiders, and bodies</page><page sequence="6">172 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER of water. Similarly, certain actions entailed inherent metaphysical dangers: crossing a bear path, digging in the earth (Apaches despised miners), killing without reason, or failing to perform an appropriate ceremony to propitiate a spirit.'2 At the same time, other beings maintained a beneficial relationship with humankind. In particular, deer, the Mountain Spirits (G'an ), and anthropomorphic dieties such as White Painted Woman and Child of the Water watched over and protected the Chokonen. These spirits resided in the landscape rather in an unseen hereafter.13 The Indian thus lived within an expansive community of beings that encompassed their entire physical environment. As an extension of this world view, Apache social and economic organization played a key role in shaping their cultural impact on the landscape. The Apache lived a semi-nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle, later supplemented by raiding of nearby settlements to acquire special products such as guns and livestock. The arid environment offered limited opportunities for agriculture, and, while farming played a minor economic role in some Apache bands, it occurred only as an anomaly among the Chokonen.'4 This type of subsistence economy required following the rhythm of the seasons to exploit natural harvests. Apache groups frequently migrated within their home territory, and beyond when necessary, in search of plants and game animals. This nmgration followed both "horizontal" and "vertical" paths, ie., in their search for food the Indians travelled across the landscape in the four directions and they travelled up and down it in elevation. This latter migration from valleys to mountain peaks and back allowed the Indians to take advantage of a broad diversity of food sources, since differences in elevation supported different mixes of vegetation and wildlife.15 Chokonen hunting and gathering must be understood within the context of this diverse environment. Even though Arizona is primarily arid, mountains capture a relatively greater proportion of atmospheric moisture, so that as one moves higher in elevation, temperatures fall and precipitation increases, creating distinct "life zones" in successive layers. Thus, the peaks of the Chiricahuas at nearly 10,000 feet elevation receive approximately thirty inches of precipitation, supporting a cool, dense, mixed conifer forest; while the Sulphur Springs valley at its base receives one third that amount of rain, creating a semi-desert of drought resistant shrubs, herbs, succulents, and grasses. In between these extremes are a number of vegetative types including the pinyon-</page><page sequence="7">1989 PAUL HIRT 173 juniper-scrub oak woodlands, and the pine-oak belt (see figure). In addition, on the western and southern periphery of Chokonen territory lies the lower and hotter Sonoran desert harboring an abundance of cacti with delectable seasonable fruits. The Apaches found plants and animals of value in every habitat type at varying times of the year. Managing the complex array of natural harvests available required an impressive breadth of skill and knowledge. Ethnobotanist Edward Castetter has said of the Chiricahua Apache, "his adaption and response to the ecological region in which he lived was sensitive and complete...These people knew nature's calendar by heart."'6 Game animals inhabited a number of different life zones, often migrating seasonally too. Deer, rabbits, squirrels, and rats could be found across several life zones; while antelope, prairie dogs, and quail mostly inhabited the valleys; with bighorn sheep, elk, turkey, and grouse preferring the uplands. These were the Apaches' favorite meat sources. Other available wildlife could and sometimes did serve as food, but cultural preferences and taboos restricted the Apache's diet. For example, they rarely ate jackrabbits, mountain lion, javelina, or beaver; and they maintained strong taboos against eating bear, coyote, fish, frogs, and snakes.17 Hunting in this diverse landscape was complex, but relatively productive as long as human populations remained small and freely migratory.18 The Apaches apparently maintained a sustainable harvest level of game animals in their two-hundred year tenure in southeast Arizona. The first evidence of widespread concern over lack of game surfaced a few years after the founding of Fort Bowie. The military had taken advantage of natural game supplies to supplement their rations, and after several years they too noted the thinning of antelope and deer herds. One Apache hunting practice did have a measurable impact on the environment: setting fires to drive game and improve wildlife habitat. Apaches drove antelope, flushed out game birds, and smoked out wood rats with fires.'9 Masters of the natural harvest in an environment regularly transformed by wildfires ignited during the monsoon thunderstorm season (July-August), Apaches could not help but notice the utility of fire as an ecological management tool.20 Fire stimulates vigorous new growth of grasses and herbs relished by rabbits, birds, grazing animals, and other game; and it creates openings in forested areas (ecological edges that are</page><page sequence="8">ELEVATION VEGETATIVE ZONES IN SOUTIIEAST ARIZONA Cool &amp; wet Temperatc MIXED CONIFER mboistV PINE-OAK Warmn &amp;V Arid PINYON-JUNIPER-OAK 4.000a f Hof l 2 n &lt; ~~~~~GRASSLAND Hot Dry</page><page sequence="9">1989 PAUL HIRT 175 wildlife rich) and fresh sprouting of shrub species which are preferred by browsing animals. Fire also serves to restrict shrub growth in the grasslands, maintaining openness in the landscape and thus improving ease of mobility and enhancing vision. Apaches liberally set fires, much to the chagrin of the Spaniards, Mexicans, and Anglo-Americans who all considered fire dangerous and destructive rather than beneficial.21 In fact, an important source of ecological change in the last one hundred years in southeast Arizona has been fire suppression322 The Chokonen depended a great deal on vegetable foods and consumed an astonishing variety of plant products, which they gathered almost continuously, except during the winter. In addition to food products, the Indians collected dozens of medicinal herbs, sacred substances, narcotics, and products for clothing and miscellaneous uses. Edward Castetter and Morris Opler documented the collection and use of over one hundred and twenty different plant species during a four year study period, and still admitted their list was "by no means a complete inventory."23 Apache gathering activities had little impact on the environment. There is no evidence that any plants were collected into extinction. While Henry Dobyns has suggested that the collection of mescal (a species of agave) did alter vegetative composition, these changes were nonetheless insignificant.24 The Chokonen collected only mature mescal plants, leaving the vast majority untouched, while the amount of fuelwood needed for the traditional two-day pit roasting process could be gathered from one tree. Besides, less than one thousand Apaches inhabited this area of about eight thousand square miles. This small population, migrating regularly, imparted only minor, localized impacts on vegetation. Apache raiding activities directly and indirectly affected environmental conditions in southeast Arizona. Livestock comprised the main raiding target, as Apaches collected horses and cattle for food and transportation. Being non-native to southeast Arizona, domestic livestock caused significant damage to grasses and streamside ecology, especially when kept in large numbers or allowed to concentrate in one area.25 (Since the "megafauna" extinctions of the late Pleistocene, the ecology of this region has evolved without the presence of large, hooved herbivores such as the bison common to the Great Plains. Scattered herds of antelope comprised the main grazing pressures on the southeast Arizona grasslands, and the size, weight, and grazing habits of these</page><page sequence="10">176 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER animals significantly differ from cattle.) While the Pima Indians and Western Apache maintained fairly substantial herds of horses that certainly had an impact on the environment, the Chokonen generally did not.26 Hispanic and Anglo ranching along the edges of "Apacheria" waxed and waned throughout the Spanish and Mexican periods. Most grazing operations concentrated in valleys and near missions. Ranchers usually kept the Santa Cruz valley well stocked. Only in occasional periods of repeated Apache raiding did livestock numbers significantly decline. The San Pedro valley was much less consistently occupied, being so close to the Apaches. Many times ranchers moved cattle onto the grassy basin only to be driven out of business by depredations or out of the valley by direct attack. In the early 1820s, for example, Mexicans established extensive ranching operations in the valley, but were forced to abandon the area completely within a decade because of Apache raids. Tens of thousands of cattle roamed wild for decades following. Eyewitnesses in the 1840s and 1850s regularly noted the existence of feral livestock in the area. The untended cattle wore erosive trails to water sources, created large wallows, and overgrazed the native grasses. Ironically, Apache raiding in this case contributed to the preservation of healthy riparian and rangeland ecosystems by temporarily halting the further influx of cattle and slowly reducing the existing populations. Not until the peak cattle boom of the 1880s and 1890s would radical vegetative alterations occur.27 In the same way, raiding kept all natural resource exploitation in southeast Arizona limited in scope. The Chiricahua hated mining, considering it a sacrilege, and virtually eliminated it from their territory. Farming was impossible and ranching unprofitable due to depredations. Economic enterprises as far away as the Santa Cruz valley suffered from raiding. Territorial residents' complaints about the Apaches fell on overburdened ears in Washington until tlhe Civil War ended, after which the government directed the military to deal more forcefully with frontier Indian problems. Even then, another two decades passed before the Apaches could be "pacified" (rounded up and shipped off to reservations or jails). An attempt to establish a southeast Arizona reservation for the Chiricahuas in 1872 failed after only four years328 (Continued occasional raiding was one of the reasons for the failure of the reservation.) Further attempts to concentrate the Chiricahua on the San Carlos and Warm Springs</page><page sequence="11">1989 PAUL HIRT 177 reservations also faltered and the Chiricahua saga ended only after a series of military defeats culminating with the final surrender of Geronimo in 1886. The temporary establishment of the Chiricahua reservation in 1872 precipitated the spread of ranching and other agricultural activities into the San Pedro valley and elsewhere around the periphery of the reserved lands. When the govemment dissolved the reservation in 1876, announcing that the Indian lands were being "returned to the public domain," entrepreneurs and settlers flooded onto the grassy valleys and into the mineral rich mountains with a vengeance, beginning a process of environmental change that would forever alter the ecological composition and permanently degrade the productive capacity of the southern Arizona landscape. Government land and resource policies played a key role in these environmental changes. The 1872 Mining Law, designed expressly to encourage mineral exploration and settlement of the western hinterlands, provided a significant boost to the mining industry in southern Arizona. By the late 1870s and early 1880s dispersed mining camps dotted the landscape, while the countryside around them became promptly cleared of timber as the miners cut wood for shelter, heating, and cooking, and for shaft timbers, milling, smelting, and pumping water. In 1881 Bisbee had two thirty-ton smelters running, with a third smelter operating in the Chiricahua mountains. One hundred and seventy stamp mills had opened in Tombstone, and dozens of separate mines with their own shafts, and reduction works operated in the Mule, Swisshelm, Dragoon, and Dos Cabezas mountains.29 Besides scars from mining activity, the added ecological effects of fuelwood cutting wrought phenomenal change. The entire landscape for miles adjacent to mining areas was denuded. Fuelwood cutting roads fanned out like the veins of a leaf causing serious erosion problems. Photos of the San Pedro river in the vicinity of Tombstone in the 1880s attest to this problem: where dense mesquite bosques and cottonwood trees once lined the river bank, nothing remained but bare soil.3' The rapid appropriation of timber and mineral resources was partly expedited also by the 1873 Timber Cutting Act, the 1878 Timber and Stone Act, and the railroad land grants, which legally endorsed essentially unregulated, unlimited exploitation. However, the 1880 arrival of the railroad, which brought access to eastern markets, proved to be the key element in the transformation</page><page sequence="12">178 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER of the landscape. Besides expanding mining activities, the railroad facilitated an explosion of the cattle industry (aided too by a cycle of wet years in the 1880s that obscured the effects of overgrazing). Outside capital flooded in from easterners and Europeans seeking to profit from the free forage on the public rangelands. In 1870, the census estimated a total of 5,000 head of cattle in all of Arizona. In 1880, there were 8,000 cattle and 10,000-12,000 sheep in the San Pedro valley alone. By 1890, at least a half a million head of cattle roamed the ranges in southeastern Arizona.31 The grasslands were drastically overstocked and disaster followed. Beginning in the summer of 1891, one of southern Arizona's recurrent drought cycles began. By the spring of 1893, the parched landscape had dealt a crushing blow to the cattle bonanza. One observer noted that the dead cattle were so numerous "you could actually throw a rock from one carcass to another."32 Livestock losses averaged 50-75 percent. Overgrazing coupled with drought and fire suppression had an enormous impact on the ecology of the region. In the days of the Apaches, the semi-desert valleys contained a thick, healthy cover of diverse grass species, with few trees. John G. Parke, on a railroad route survey in the 1850s, saw "smooth and grassy plains" with little wood available in the Sulphur Springs valley.33 In the San Simon valley before the introduction of cattle, grasses reached a horse's belly, and "beautiful" meadows and watering holes abounded.m By 1893 the scene was quite different. Wherever cattle congregated they grazed palatable forage into oblivion, allowing inedible species like burroweed to take over. Livestock trampled, compacted, and exposed the soil to the drying and erosive effects of sun and wind, making it harder for shallow-rooted vegetation to survive and propagate. Overgrazing, combined with a reduction in the occurrence of fire, resulted in the loss of grasses and an exponential increase in shrubby species like mesquite.3 A botanist from the University of Arizona in 1891 complained that the grasslands had been so denuded that he had difficulty finding specimens to study.-6 When the rains came, the absence of grasses in many places led to increased runoff and downstream flooding. This increase in runoff lessened the infiltration of moisture into the soil, causing further desiccation and leading to a phenomenon that ecologist Paul Sears has dubbed "deserts on the march." Wildlife as well as livestock suffered from these developments.</page><page sequence="13">1989 PAUL HIRT 179 Prior to the 1890s, the flood plains of the San Pedro and San Simon rivers were wide, unchanneled, marshy areas with perennial surface flows along lengthy portions of their reach. Periodic floodwaters ran shallow and slow, often spreading out as wide as a mile. In the mid-1880s, during a cycle of wet years and coincident with the introduction of large herds of cattle and the cutting of timber for mining and settlement, the frequency and severity of floods escalated. Record flows were recorded on the San Pedro in 1886 and 1887. The flooding peaked in 1890 when a major trench eroded into the San Pedro stream bed.37 Farmers at first reacted positively to this entrenchment. The channel that had been cut appeared useful in containing the river during high water so that crops planted in the flood plain would escape damage. Channelization also lowered the groundwater table causing springs and marshy areas to dry up, and this helped eliminate malaria from the valleys since breeding areas for mosquitos were greatly reduced in size and number. It eventually became apparent, however, that the detriments of river bed entrenchment outweighed the advantages. The rapid transnmssion of rainwater down the narrow channels not only caused continued erosion and flood damage, but also significantly reduced groundwater recharge. (Riverbeds provide the vast majority of recharge into southern Arizona's groundwater reservoirs.) As the surface water flows became less frequent and less manageable, groundwater became increasingly important to agriculturalists; yet as recharge declined so did the water table. Entrenchment occurred in the San Simon valley at this time too. Overgrazing in the watershed set up the conditions and agriculturalists near the confluence of the Gila River initiated the process. The farmers purposefully dug a channel to protect their crops from spreading flood waters. Again, they initially expressed delight with their results: "It worked, and today there is a chasm, in many places 600 to 800 feet wide and from 10 feet to 30 feet deep, for 60 miles, as the indirect result of their effective work to protect their lands from overflow.3 These settlers also quickly learned that an entrenched river channel offered fewer benefits than problems. Thus, within one generation Anglo-American resource exploitation had transformed the vegetation, associated wildlife, and hydrological conditions to such a degree that the landscape barely resembled its former state. How do we account for this? First, environmental factors must be acknowledged. Contrary to</page><page sequence="14">180 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER popular notions, and environments are not "hardy" from having adapted to a harsh climate, but rather are delicate and easily disrupted. Small changes in temperature or rainfall over extended periods can significantly alter vegetative composition. While the science of predicting climatic alterations over long periods is inexact, researchers have identified an apparent warming and drying trend in the last 200 years; even though they continue to debate its significance. Some scholars like Hastings and Turner argue that climatic shifts instilled a readiness for change in the area's ecology for which the exploitive activities of the late 19th century provided the trigger. Others like Bahre and Bradbury argue that the climatic data is inconclusive and pin the cause more directly on factors such as overgrazing.? In either case, cultural factors remain essential to the story. They provide the key to understanding the transformation of the southeast Arizona landscape. Anglo-American entrepreneurs came to Arizona with a belief system that sharply distinguished between "man" and "nature," viewing the latter primarily as raw material for wealth. Nature was objectified and commodified. To the early trappers, beaver were simply "pelts," to be harvested in the most economically efficient manner. Their activities succeeded in wiping out the entire beaver population on the San Pedro in only two expeditions in the 1820s.40 Beaver dams slow flood waters, aid in groundwater recharge, and enhance wetlands valuable to wildlife. Their destruction contributed to the destruction of riparian ecosystems and the consequent loss of crucial wildlife habitat. Sirmilarly, by viewing the grasslands as "cattle forage," profit-seeking ranchers stocked all available acres of the public rangelands, encouraging their livestock to consume everything palatable. This led directly to the loss of the grasslands. Viewing forests as "fuelwood" and "board feet of lumber" led to fire suppression campaigns, that in turn led to hazardous build-up of leaves, brush, and dead trees, causing wildfires to rage even more destructively when they occurred, thus defeating the original purpose of fire suppression. The irony here is that the Anglo-American ideologies and political and economic arrangements that placed such a high value on resource production actually resulted in resource deterioration and a substantial decline in productive capacity. A utilitarian society had created an environment of degraded utility. In the</page><page sequence="15">1989 PAUL HIRT 181 same sense, the establishment of private property rights to land and resources brought economic instability rather than security, as excessive exploitation rendered many properties worthless. The ethos of personal wealth accumulation contributed to erratic booms and busts leaving at least as many people destitute as enriched. Thus, Anglo-American society on the southern Arizona frontier found itself uncomfortably prone to unintentional and undesirable consequences springing from its self-defeating ideologies and forms of social organization. Technology goes hand in hand with ideology when seeking an explanation for the impact of cultures on the environment. Industrial society in the late 19th century developed powerful tools for acting on desires and accomplishing goals. The Apaches in contrast used only fire, guns, and the horse. Some historians have been tempted to assume, as Henry Dobyns did, that the Apache low-impact lifestyle "stemmed from [limited] technological capability rather than high valuation of any given natural environment."41 But this view has flaws. History is full of examples of failed attempts to teach Indians 'better" (ie., more technologically and economically efficient) ways of doing things. The Apaches themselves resisted government attempts to make them over into farmers instead of gatherers, and ranchers instead of raiders. In point of fact, any innovation can be rather ineffective without the appropriate ideology driving its application. Calvin Martin discussed this issue of technology and ideology in his book Keepers of the Game. Attempting to explain why the eastern Canadian Indians overhunted the beaver during the fur-trade period, he argued that the near total decimation of fur-bearers only occurred once the Indian belief-system and social organization had been substantially undermined by the successive waves of disease that decimated the tribes following Anglo contact. The profit motive did not lead to overhunting, nor did "consumer dependence," since the Indians clearly preferred their subsistence economy, he argued, experiencing their lifestyle as one of relative abundance rather than poverty. The introduction of new technology in the form of metal traps did not sufficiently explain the overhunting either, since Indian technology, even though "primitive," would still have been quite adequate for the task if not for the protective mechanisms against such destructive practices built into their belief system. 42 Technologies and their employment are inextricably tied to the value systems and social structures of the cultures that</page><page sequence="16">182 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER innovated their design. Certainly industrial technology proved indispensable to the Anglo-American exploitation of natural resources, but it does not follow that with those same technologies available the Chiricahua Apaches would have done likewise. The cultural-ideological component is inescapable. Historians have long emphasized the importance of belief systems in explaining human-environmental interactions. Lynn White, in his essay "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis," claimed that the root of this crisis is ideological, and specifically religious: "By destroying pagan animism, Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of natural objects." Donald Worster echoed these sentiments in his book Nature's Economy when he asserted that the impulse to dominate nature began with the desacralization of the physical world. Roderick Nash's Wilderness and the American Mind was entirely devoted to an elucidation of Anglo-American attitudes toward "wild" nature. Chapter two looked at frontier hostility to wilderness and emphasized the utilitarian, even militaristic, bent of mind that characterized frontier settlers' relationship to the environment.43 Like technology, economic systems are also a product of cultural forms -- although they sometimes seem to develop a life of their own. The ambivalence of many Indian tribes to engage whole- heartedly in the frontier fur trade offers one example of how market economies can be accessible yet still not acceptable. Richard White, in his book Roots of Dependency, studied the Choctaws in the 18th century, the Pawnees in the 19th century, and the Navajos in the 20th century, and found that in all cases, they staunchly resisted efforts by whites to integrate them into the market economy. The Indians clearly perceived such integration as a grave threat to their own social organization and forestalled the inevitable for as long as their traditional society remained viable. Significantly, he remarked that "culture here controlled economics."44 The Chiricahua Apache clearly fit this pattern. Their harassment of beaver trappers is one example (see footnote 40). All students of the Chiricahuas note the Indians' resistance to farming, mining, and waged labor. (Hiring out as army scouts was the exception to the rule.) In fact, other than a brief participation in wild hay harvests, there is virtually no evidence that the Chokonen willingly engaged in any market activities during the 19th century. 45</page><page sequence="17">1989 PAUL HIRT 183 The Anglo-American value system, powered by potent technologies, supported by an expanding capitalist economy, and buttressed by public policies endorsing unsustainable consumption of natural resources, created an environmental crisis in the late 19th century, the legacy of which remains today. Vast areas of once nearly treeless prairie now support forests of thorny scrub. The potential of the land to sustain livestock and foraging wildlife is a fraction of what it was in the early 19th century. Soil erosion remains a significant problem. The Coronado National Forest, which now has jurisdiction over a number of the mountain ranges in the former Chokonen landscape, recently published its fifty-year land management plan and environmental impact statement. On page 75 under a subsection titled "Range" the document acknowledged that when the Coronado Forest was established in 1902 "the grazed portion of the range was severely overgrazed," and that "to this day ranges show signs of this stress." Grazing use today still exceeds estimated grazing capacity by 20 percent, while 76 of 208 grazing allotments "exhibit an unsatisfactory management situation." On page 77 under a subsection titled "Soil and Water" the document states that "past resource use and activities have created unacceptable soil erosion and reduced water quality... Pollution of streams, ponds, and lakes is of major concern. Sedimentation is the major pollutant..." The EIS blames "improper livestock grazing" along with unstable channels, off-road vehicles, and improperly maintained roads as the main contributors to sedimentation. Thirty-one percent of forest watersheds are judged to be in "unsatisfactory" condition.46 The San Pedro and San Simon rivers are still largely entrenched and channelized, and carry heavily silt-laden floodwaters during the rainy season. Agriculture and urban areas have mined the groundwater at rates far exceeding natural recharge so that the water table has dropped precipitously in many places. Without the artificial importation of more water or radical changes in social organization another crisis looms in the future. Vegetation changes, competition from livestock, and the loss of habitat to development have caused many wildlife species to decline-some have been extirpated. Predator control programs calculatedly eliminated such magnificent species as the grizzly bear, jaguar, and Mexican gray wolf from southern Arizona; state</page><page sequence="18">184 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER and federal endangered species programs struggle to keep pace with the incidence of declining species.47 But social attitudes and public policies regarding land use have significantly altered in recent decades, partly as a result of concern over environmental degradation and declining resource productivity, partly due to a burgeoning interest in outdoor recreation, and partly due to the intrusion of ecological concepts into the policy-making arena. An historical perspective thus offers not only a record of imprudence and destruction, but also a limited record of attempts to rectify some of these problems. The Coronado National Forest in southeast Arizona has had some limited success in restricting livestock numbers to a theoretical "carrying capacity" designed to reduce stress on the range and leave enough forage to maintain wildlife and ground cover. Land managers have also relaxed their fire suppression activities in favor of a more natural fire regime. They have even implemented a program of "prescribed burning" to reestablish more natural conditions in areas with excessive fuel build-up. The Bureau of Land Management initiated a well- intentioned but largely unsuccessful replanting project on the San Simon river in the mid-1980s, hoping to reestablish riparian woodland vegetation there. They also participated in a major land trade in 1986, acquiring the San Pedro river from a private land development corporation and promoting its protection through federal designation as a "Riparian National Conservation Area," the first such designation the nation. In the intervening one hundred years between the peak mining boom of the 1880s and today, much of the cut down and burned down riparian forests along the San Pedro river have begun to regenerate.48 Just as State wildlife and horticultural programs have targeted significant and threatened Arizona species and their habitats for special management, state cultural and historical resource programs have tried to identify and protect vestiges of early Arizona. Private organizations like the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Historic Preservation also contribute to these efforts. But real success requires more than piecemeal land acquisitions and changes in technology or management practices. True reform is contingent upon fundamental changes in social values, economic arrangements, and the institutions that implement public policy. Continued federal subsidies for the western livestock industry (ie., grazing fees kept well below market value), along</page><page sequence="19">1989 PAUL HIRT 185 with the "use it or lose it" (prior appropriations) doctrine of western water rights, and state constitutional mandates to maximize economic returns on state trust lands all support waste and environmentally unsound/unsustainable resource exploitation. Institutional arrangements that support resource development also tend to ignore externalities, including the hidden costs associated with pollution and resource depletion. An ecosystem approach to natural resource policy would mitigate problems associated with the commodity approach, such as overgrazing, fire suppression, and pesticide contamination. A commitment to a sustainable society would help mitigate or avoid certain predictable socio-conomic crises such as groundwater overdraft and mineral depletion. Mandating greater consideration of non-market values in natural resource planning would help remedy some of the excesses of resource exploitation. Unfortunately, existing institutional arrangements-including congressional funding priorities for federal land management- continue to heavily favor consumptive and extractive activities, while favorable economic incentives continue to support irresponsible exploitation of privately owned resources. Progress must be made in all these areas. This paper originated in a seminar on U.S. frontier history taught by Roger Nichols at the University of Arizona. I would like to acknowledge the guidance, helpful critidsms, and kind support professor Nichols offered throughout the evolution of this project. 'Southern Arizona has long been a mecca for professionals in ecology and related sciences. It is also widely recognized as one of the top birding spots in North America. The key feature that makes this area of interest is its diversity. For example, a study in 1964 cataloguing the existence of mammal species from Panama to the Arctic Circle actually found that southeastern Arizona contained the second greatest density of mammal species of any place north of Mexico. (he referent here is species density, not population density. The Sierra Nevada mountains of California took first place with 115 different species; southeast Arizona came in a close second with 110 species.) George Gaylord Simpson, "Species Density of North American Recent Mammals," Systantic Zoology, v. 13, no. 2 qune 1964), 60. A 1978 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report endorsed Simpson's conclusions while proposing protection for a number of areas in Arizona. The report identified eight "unique and nationally significant wildlife ecosystems" in the state and all but one of them occurred in southeast Arizona. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Unique Wildlife Ecosystems of Arizona (Albuquerque: Region 2, 1978), 23. 2 James Rodney Hastings and Raymond M. Turner, The Changing Mile (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1965), 3. 3 Ibid., 104. 4 The idea that the environment provides a set of fairly broad constraints within which human cultures are free to creatively alter the ecology to meet their social and economic needs first surfaced most cogently in the writings of James C. Malin. Malin talked of 'latent potentials" in the landscape which humans can develop through direct intervention. In the context of a criticism of the Clements school of ecology, Malin became one of the first historians to wam against the pitfalls of adopting an analytical model based on the concept of a climax equilibrium state of nature to which all human intervention becomes a "disturbance." See Robert Swierenga's edited</page><page sequence="20">186 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER collection of Malin's essays titled History and Ecology (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1984). Malin's essay, "Ecology and History," 105-11 (1948), elaborates his theme of mutual cultural-environmental adaptation. See also xix-xx of Swierenga's introduction for a further discussion. Malin's positive contributions were marred by his ideological crusade against the New Deal, which drove him to excesses in his application of ecological theory to social critique; viz., his assertion that the Dust Bowl did not really constitute an environmental problem and that, in any case, agriculture was blameless (pp. 3-10). For a relevant critique of Malin, see Donald Worster's Dust Bowl: The Southern Plains in the 1930s (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), 205-06. 5 This type of historical analysis which unites an ethnological and an ecological perspective within a comparative cultures context has some very fine precedents. Two works which have been particularly influential are William Cronon's Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England (New York: Hill and Wang, 1983) and Richard White's Roots of Dependency: Subsistence, Environment, and Social Change among the Choctaws, Pawnees, and Navajos (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1983). Like both these authors, I have attempted to reconstruct the ecological and cultural character of the landscape, contrast Native American and Anglo-American belief systems and environmental relations, and describe the transformation of the landscape that accompanied the change in tenure from one culture to the other. 6Keith H. Basso states that the Apaches arrived between 1000-1500 A.D., establishing themselves and separating into the historically recognized tribes and bands by the late 1500s; in Grenville Goodwin, Western Apache Raiding and Warfare, ed. by Keith H. Basso (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1971), 12 Henry Dobyns postulated a later arrival date associated with the Pueblo revolt in New Mexico in the 1680s, in his book From Fire to Flood (Socorro, N.M.: Ballena Press, 1981), 34. Other scholars fall variously within this time frame. By the end of the 17th century there is ample documentation of Apache raids on the Hispanic population in Sonora and on Pima Indians in Arizona. 7 In this essay I am following the spelling as well as the band divisions used by Donald C. Cole in his dissertation "Ethnohistory of the Chiricahua Apache," (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico, 1981). Cole is himself a Chiricahua Apache. He distinguished ten separate bands within the Chiricahua tribe, as opposed to Morris Opler's classic but overgeneralized division of three. Cole also used the Apache names for those bands, ie., Chokonen, which I have adopted for this essay. 8 Calvin Martin, Keepers of the Game (Berkeley: University of Califomnia Press, 1978), 20. While Martin's thesis regarding Indian motivations in the overhunting of fur-bearing animals remains controversial, his ethnohistorical focus on the Indian "religious landscape" has been influential. Richard White, 'The Cultural Landscape of the Pawnees," Great Plains Quarterly, 2, (Winter 1982), 33-34. 9 The two primary resources on Chiricahua mythology are Harry Hoijer, Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache Texts (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1938) and Morris Opler, Myths and Tales of the Chiricahua Apache Indians, Memoir of the American Folklore Society, 37, (New York: G.E. Stechert and Co., 1942). See Opler, 23-25, for an account of the origin of daylight (the Moccasin Game). Also see Michael Melody, 'The Sacred Hoop: The Way of the Chiricahua Apache and the Teton Lakota," (PhD dissertation, University of Notre Dame, 1976), 113, for an illuminating discussion of the sacredness of the landscape. 10 The quote about "power" is from Cole, 41, cting an anonymous Apache informant. The basic, dassic text on Apache culture and world view is Morris Opler's An Apache Life-Way (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1941); see 200-06 for a discussion of "power."

By the 1850s, raiding had become a major economic activity, but until then, hunting and gathering really formed the foundation of the Chokonen economy.</page><page sequence="21">1989 PAUL HIRT 187 15 'If not pressed, the normal movement pattern of Chiricahua camps was to change altitude rather than latitude or longitude"; ie., highlands in the summer and lowlands in the winter. Cole, 27. For a related discussion of migratory patterns of seasonal hunting and gathering in a different environment, see Cronon's third chapter of Changes in the Land, titled "Seasons of Want and Plenty. 16 Castetter and Opler, 10. 17 The main source of information on Apache hunting and meat-eating practices is Castetter and Opler (ibid.) and Opler, An Apache Life-Way; see 25-26 in the former and 325-30 in the latter. Also, Jason Betzinez, I Fought with Geronimo Harrisburg Pa.: The Stackpole Co., 1959), discusses this subject and indudes some interesting information on dietary taboos, 29-37. 18 The importance of maintaining a sustainable population level cannot be underestimated. Cronon cited "Liebig's Law" (p. 41), an ecological principle stating that biological populations are naturally limited by the minimum amount of subsistence resources available at the scarcest time of year. In the arid environment of southern Arizona, this law is especially relevant. Seasonal droughts as well as cyclical drought cydes kept the Apache population in this area stable at about one thousand. 19 Apaches also set the grasslands aflame as signals, and during warfare. Jason Betzinez related a story of an escape from San Carlos in which his group under Geronimo encountered some Indian scouts who had been tracldng them for the pursuing soldiers. During the encounter, the scouts "set fire to the grass to tell their main body that they had met the hostile Indians." (p. 63.) 20 While ecologists readily acknowledge the beneficial grassland promoting effects of fires, there is some contention over the role of fire in establishing and maintaining the grasslands of southem Arizona. There is also a debate over the role of Indians in that ecological process. Hastings and Turner hypothesized in 1965 that fire was not a significant factor in Sonoran grassland ecology, nor the Indians important contributors to natural fire regime. Regarding the role of fire see The Changing Mile, 38-40; regarding the role of the Indians see 26-27. More recently, Henry Dobyns, in his 1981 book From Fire to Flood, criticized both the conclusions and use of evidence in ne Changing Mile. In a lengthy analysis on pp. 27-37 he comes to the opposite conclusions as Hastings and Turner. Historian Stephen Pyne also affirms the role of fire and the role of the Apache promoted by Dobyns. See his exhaustive monograph Fire in America (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982), 514-29. Fmally, Conrad Bahre also disagrees with Hastings and Turner, based on a tabulation of the role of Apaches in the incidence of grassland fires as reported in the Tucson and Tombstone press between 1859 and 1890. Conrad Bahre, 'Wildfire in Southeastern Arizona Between 1859 and 1890," Desert Plants, v. 7, no. 4 (1985), 190-94. 21 See Dobyns, 27-37 for an exhaustive discussion of Apache use of fire; and Cronon, chapter three for a comparative discussion of Indian use of fire and the effects of fire on the ecological mosaic of the New England landscape. Cronon asserts that the Indians of New England did not just partake of a natural abundance, but actually had been "consciously instrumental in creating" conditions conducive to their hunting and gathering practices (p. 51). See also 100-01 for a description of the effects of fire suppression following the removal of the Indians. Richard White showed that Native Americans in northwest Washington employed fire to increase harvests of camas and braken, two of their most important vegetable staples. He also discussed the use of fire by Pawnees to improve horse pasturage. In both of these cases, White noted how Anglo- Americans failed to comprehend the positive value of fire and sought vigorously to suppress it, leading to significant ecological alterations following the change-over in cultural hegemony on the landscape: 'Indian Land Use and Environmental Change: Island County Washington-A Case Study," Arizona and the West, 17 (Winter 1975), 327-38; and 'The Cultural Landscape of the Pawnees," 37-38. 22 Hastings and Turner provide the most comprehensive documentation of vegetative change on this landscape with their paired photographs in The Changing Mile. Conrad Bahre convincingly argues that the widespread encroachment of mesquite onto the grasslands beginning in the 1890s can be traced to a combination of fire suppression and overgrazing in his 'Wildfire in Southeastern Arizona," 190-94. 23 Castetter and Opler, 3. 24 Dobyns, 91-92. 25 Many contemporary sources noted deleterious effects from livestock grazing. One report by James T. Duce, entitled 'The Effects of Cattle on the Erosion of Canyon Bottoms," Science, 47, (1918), 450-52, documented numerous problems. He observed erosion channels forming out of</page><page sequence="22">188 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FALL/WINTER cattle paths, and in a grazed area of a canyon found "nothing but a trampled field of dust." In an ungrazed area of the same canyon he found "deep grass so matted and tangled as to preclude any thought of erosion." 26 Dobyns, 88-89, theorizes that changes in streamside ecology may have initiated in some watersheds in southern Arizona in the 1820( due to Hispanic and Indoamerican herding but he does not find any evidence of large herding in Chokonen territory, other than in the San Pedro valley by non-Indian ranchers. 27Conrad J.

He found the same conditions in the San Simon Valley. Hastings and Turner cited additional observations by Spaniards, Mexicans, and early Americans (pp. 34,3740). All accounts agreed, they concluded, that "grass was plentiful; the landscape was open, that mesquite [trees], though widespread, had nothing like its present density." 34 Will C.

Also see Dobyns, 64-68 for additional citations from contemporaries on conditions in the San Simon valley before and after Anglo penetration and resource development. 35 In his essay, 'Wildfire in Southeastern Arizona," Bahre comments that large grassland fires declined after 1882, "probably as a result of overgrazing." He also documents the "brush invasion" of the 1890s that followed this wildfire cessation (190-94). 36The botanist's comment is cited in Bahie and Bradbury, '"Vegetation Change Along the Arizona- Sonora Boundary," 164. 37 Hastings and Tumer, 41-42. 38 Frank H. Olmsted, Gila River Flood Control (Washington: 65th Cong., 3rd Sess., Sen Doc. 436, 1919), 79. 39 Bahre and Bradbury, in 'Vegetation Change Along the Arizona-Sonora Boundary," credibly argue that abuse by the livestock industry was the main cause of undesirable environmental changes of the late 19th century. They find Hastings and Turner's thesis that climate comprised the the main factor in vegetative change as "the least convincing of the theories." 159-61. 40 Dobyns recounts the exploits of several trapping expeditions working the Gila river and its tributaries out of Santa Fe in 1826 and 1828, including the James Ohio Pattie group. The earlier expedition made its way six miles up the San Pedro, which they called "Beaver River," and collected 200 pelts before Apaches attacked them and stole their horses. In 1828 Pattie's group of twenty-four men also trapped the San Pedro. In his journal he noted how three or four good trappers could take "all that a stream affords."

The heyday (so to speak) of wild hay harvesting occurred between 1850-1899 according to Bahre. Prior to Geronimo's final surrender in 1886, Indian hay harvesters complained of harassment by "renegades"; that is, more or less domesticated harvesters were being harassed by traditionalists resisting the market. Contemporary sources identified the Indian harvesters as belonging primarily to the Aravaipa band of the Western Apache tribe-one of the few bands which had traditionally engaged in small scale agriculture-or as being San Carlos reservation Indians. Bahre includes a photograph of several Apache women posed in front of a large mound of hay; he does not indicate whether hay harvesting was considered female labor. 46 U.S.D.A.
