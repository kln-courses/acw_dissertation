<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bernard Grossfeld, A Bibliography of Tar gum Literature II (Bi- bliographica Judaica 8). xxxi-113 p. 27,5x21,5. Cincinnati - New York 1977, Hebrew Union College Press - KTAV Publishing House. $20. The importance of Grossfeld's Bibliography of Tar gum Literature is best expressed by the fact that Vol. 1 of this work was reviewed in no less than 16 scholarly journals between 1973 and 1976. In spite of all the criticisms that were raised in the process, the Bibliography was unanimously recognized as a pioneering work in the field of Targumic Studies, and as an essential reference book for future research. Grossfeld requested to be informed of omissions, and promised a new volume in return. Within the framework of the above-mentioned reviews, and also, privately, scholars responded generously. And now Grossfeld has rewarded them with a second volume, and is to be con- gratulated. The 768 items in the new volume, bring the total number of entries to over 1800. Some 370 items belong to the pre- 1970 period and round out the original work. Many obscure works that liad been confined to oblivion for decades or even centuries, have been revived once again by Grossfeld. The remaining 400 items appeared between 1971 and 1976, and are a fine tribute to the present flourishing of Targumic Studies. The format and inner division of the present volume is the same as that of Vol. 1 (See my review in Bib 55 [1974] 281-285); and yet there are several important additions: 1. A list of "addenda and corrigenda" to Vol. 1 (pp. xm-xvii) 2. A list of reviews of Vol. 1 (xix-xx)</page><page sequence="2">420 Recensiones 3. A partial listing of Theses and Dissertations (Section X, pp. 63-66) 4. A comprehensive author index to both Volumes (100-110) 5. A selective and non-exhaustive subject index, including such items as Anthropomorphism, Cairo Genizah, Manuscripts, Peshitta and Qumran (111-112). It is understandable that in the interest of uniformity with the first volume, certain desirable improvements could not be introduced (e.g., in the English transcription of the names of Hebrew periodicals). On the other hand, without detracting from the overall value of the work, there is one apparent flaw that ought to be pointed out, namely the many unnecessary repetitions and redundancies throughout the work. Although I am not a professional bibliographer, it would seem to me that listing three printings of the same work with the very same pagination as three separate entries (e.g., 1240-42) is wasteful. Likewise, Volumes II, III and IV of Neophyti 1 by A. Diez Macho (1495-97), which take up almost an entire page, might have been condensed into a single entry. The same holds for items 1125-26, 1128-32, 1140-41, 1232-35, 1281-82, 1298-1303. Grossfeld notes that most of the items listed in Chapter X (Theses and Dissertations) were collected from various issues of the Newsletter for Targumic Studies . The following are a few minor corrections to those listings: Item 1536. The author's name is Schreibman, not Schriebman. Item 1537. The D.H.I,, thesis by Shai Shacknai was not completed, due to the untimely death of the author. Although efforts are being made to edit the work, it is presently not available. Item 1540. To the best of this reviewer's knowledge, Weiss' dissertation has not yet been published. One chapter of the work was published posthumously as an article in Tarbiz 44 (1974-75), 54-71. This is listed by Grossfeld as item 1454, but not noted as being related to the dissertation. Item 1541. The date of publication is 1962, not 1969. Finally, due to the incomplete nature of this Chapter, a work such as P. S. Alexander, The Toponomy of the Targumim... (Oxford 1974) has been omitted. In summation, then, minor criticisms notwithstanding, we cannot overstate the importance of the Bibliography, nor can we thank Gross- feld too much, for all of his successful efforts in compiling this valuable work.
