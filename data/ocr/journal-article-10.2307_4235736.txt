<plain_text><page sequence="1">Social Fabrics of the Mind Michael R.A. Chance, ed. (assisted by Donald R. Omark) Hove and London: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers, 1988 Pr?cis. This collection is intended "to distinguish what we share with [our] zoological relatives and what distin- guishes us from them at least in degree9' (p. 1). The conceptual framework posits two mental modes, the agonic and the hedonic, which are related to two basic primate social orders. These are discussed at some length in an introduction by Chance who then relates them to the various chapters of the book. He concludes by stressing the importance of surmounting discipli- nary boundaries in order to "address the problem of establishing a single behavioural [sic] science by un- derstanding the nature of the biological systems." (p. 24) Subsequently, Chance relates this to political be- havior and the requirements of a stable governmental order based primarily on hedonic principles. The volume is divided into fourteen chapters. Chapter 1, "A Systems Syntheses of Mentality," is written by Chance. The subsequent chapters are: "Social Geome- try and Cohesion in Three [Nonhuman] Primate Spe- cies" (Gary R. Emory); "Social Attention and Social Awareness" (Thomas K. Pitcairn); "The Reconciled Hierarchy" (Frans B. M. de Waal); "The Origin of Human Equality" (Junichiro Itani); "Alternative Chan- nels for Negotiating Asymmetry in Social Relation- ships" (John Price); "Psychiatric Syndromes as Infra- structure for Intra-specific Communication" (Russell Gardner, Jr.); "The Therapeutic Useof an Ethogram in a Drug Addiction Unit" (Peter Scott Lewis); "Social Interactions of Young Children with Peers and their Modifications in Relation to Environmental Factors" (H. Montagner et al.); "The Structure of Politically Relevant Behaviours in Pre-school Peer Groups" (Carol Barner-Barry); "Nice Guys DON'T Finish Last: Ag- gressive and Appeasement Gestures in Media Images of Politicians" (Roger D. Masters); "Two Dimensions of Sociality" (Theodore D. Kern per); and 'Organisational Culture and the Agonic/Hedonic Bimodality" (Felix Wedgwood-Oppenheim). Finally, there is a glossary, as well as author and subject indices. -Carol Barner-Barry</page><page sequence="2">157 Review of Social Fabrics of the Mind William E. Addison Psychology Department Eastern Illinois University Charleston, Illinois (USA) 61920 Michael Chance has managed to bring together in his book a most impressive group of international authors with a wide variety of research interests. The scientific disci- plines represented here include animal behavior, anthro- pology, political science, psychiatry, psychology, and sociology. Given this diversity, the reader quite naturally may wonder about the degree of continuity with which such material can be presented. Chance addresses this issue in his introductory chapter by emphasizing the major theme of the book: structural features of social relations in humans and other animals. He attempts to make a case for viewing the book as a much needed synthesis of related orientations. However, a major problem with this chapter is that an overabundance of detail concerning later chapters is pro- vided in order to establish a common framework for the book as a whole. Much of this material would be more appropriately placed in a summary chapter near the end of the book. Chance also discusses other themes in the introduction that will be more or less maintained throughout the book. One example is the tendency to generalize to humans the findings of research dealing with social organization in other species. Many behavioral researchers would proba- bly agree that such generalizations, when made from stud- ies of nonhuman primates, can be appropriate. However, I have serious reservations concerning some of the leaps that are made across branches of the phylogenetic tree. Chance's comparison of agonistic behavior in birds and fish to mental illness in humans (p. 8) is particularly disconcerting. Al- though Chance and several of the other authors (e.g., Gardner, Kemper, Wedg wood-Oppenheim) make ita point to acknowledge the problems inherent in such generaliza- tions, the acknowledgments generally have the tone of obligatory attention. For example, Gardner is to be com- mended for asking the question, "Can humans truly be compared to other animals? (p. 203)" However, he then proceeds to introduce the concept of "relative homology" as the basis for the construction of a list of eight "psalics" in which patterns of social behavior in nonhuman animals are related to psychiatric disorders in humans. These comparisons certainly make for interesting reading, but I think they exceed the limit of "appropriate" cross-species generalizations. Perhaps the worst offender in this regard is Price (Chap- ter 7). His generalization from "cringing behavior" in low ranking monkeys to anxiety and depression in humans is an analogy that many ethologists and animal behaviorists are not likely to accept (p. 160), even when the level of comparison (from nonhuman primate to human primate) is taken into account. The discussion relating pecking orders in domestic chickens to marital conflict in humans is equally, if not more, puzzling. In this case, Price justifiably admits that"it is unsatisfactory to call the hostile interaction between husband and wife% threat display' orv pecking,* and equally unsatisfactory to call the pecking of the subordinate by the dominant buxTnagging'...(p. 176-178) "However, he then includes both pecking behavior in birds and nag- ging behavior in humans under the general term "catathetic signals." This is an interesting strategem that allows him to use the comparative generalizations that he wishes while simultaneously giving some credence to the opposing view. Directly related to the use of cross-species generaliza- tions evident in this book is the tendency for some of the authors to rely on anthropomorphic terms to describe various aspects of social behavior in nonhuman animals. In addition to the aforementioned "cringing behavior" in monkeys, other examples include Power's descriptions of the "carnival" gatherings of wild chimpanzees, and her use of terms such as "nervous" and "assured" to describe the behavior of the monkeys (Chapter 4). Although other instances occur with some regularity, I admit to being particularly surprised to find de Waal describing the "temper tantrums" that chimpanzees exhibit when they lose a conflict (Chapter 5). A more positive theme of the book is the emphasis on the study of social behavior in the group context (see Chance, Pitcairn, de Waal). This is a notion that is frequently ignored by researchers studying social organization in humans and other animals. From a methodological stand- point, it is relatively simple to conduct a study in which pairs of subjects are isolated from the group in order to determine a dominance relationship between them. For ex- ample, there is much classic psychological research in the area of group dynamics based on the analysis of dyadic interactions, with little attention paid to the concomitant social behavior of other group members. In the field of animal behavior, researchers have begun to recognize in the last ten to fifteen years the importance of maintaining the notion of group context when attempting to establish specific patterns of social structure. Thus, terms such as "social dominance" and "competitive dominance" are now used to distinguish between what are likely two different patterns of social behavior. As Pitcairn so clearly explains, "primate cohesion and sociality comprise more than the sum total of dyadic or triadic relations" (p. 72).</page><page sequence="3">158 Many of the other authors also have some excellent points to make regarding sociality in humans and other animals. Power justifiably emphasizes the importance of observational research in studies of primate social behavior (Chapter 4). Her comment that some of the naturalistic studies of chimpanzees have been undervalued is well taken (p. 78). She also provides a relatively detailed ration- ale for discussing the similarities in social organization among human and nonhuman primates (pp. 81 - 83). I found this approach to be a refreshing counterbalance to the broad assumptions made by other authors regarding such gener- alizations. De Waal's chapter (Chapter 5) seems to be the keystone for the early part of the book, which focuses primarily on studies of sociality in nonhuman primates. De Waal man- ages to successfully integrate information gleaned from studies of chimpanzees, baboons, macaques, and other nonhuman primates into a well- documented, very readable chapter. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Itani's chapter (Chapter 6), which I think suffers as a result of the translation from Japanese to English. Itani's discussion of the distinctions among conditional versus original versus civil equality is fairly obtuse, and the material seems only marginally related to previous chapters. The contributions of Price and Gardner (Chapters 7 and 8) have already been discussed in terms of the problems with the cross-species generalizations that serve as the bases for their respective models. In defense of the authors, the material in these chapters involves some relatively sophisticated terminology. Price's theory, for example, is clearly based on a previously developed mathematical model of some complexity. In addition, the material in both chapters is certainly intriguing; however, I found the ap- proach to be overly speculative in nature. Chapters by Lewis, Montagner and colleagues, and Barner- Barry focus on specific research projects designed to examine social structure in adult drug addicts (Lewis) and young children (Montagner and colleagues; Barner- Barry). I found the studies of the children to be particularly interesting, although the writing style in Chapter 10 (Montagner et al.) is frequently awkward, possibly as a result of translation. Barner-Barry takes the unique ap- proach?at least from my perspective as a psychologist? of analogizing a group of children to a body of government, complete with many of the same basic functions. Although I found her approach intriguing, there are few references to the specific concepts that serve to maintain at least a minimal degree of continuity among the other chapters. On the other hand, Montagner et al. include several references to hedonic and agonistic social groups, terms that are introduced by Chance early in the book. Masters' chapter (Chapter 12) dealing with nonverbal cues of dominance used by politicians seems to stray somewhat from the general theme of the book, but it makes some excellent points regarding editorial bias. In short, Masters found evidence to support the notion that newspa- per editors are biased in both the quantity and quality of pictures of politicians selected for print. Kemper's chapter (Chapter 12), presents the views of a sociologist as they relate to some of the issues discussed in previous chapters. Although there is little new information provided, the author's use of terminology derived from sociological theory to describe social structure in humans and other primates is an effective demonstration of the multi- disci- plinary nature of this subject matter. The final chapter by Wedgwood-Oppenheim serves mainly as an attempt to establish some degree of cohesion for the book as a whole. Wedgwood- Oppenheim returns to Chance's original ter- minology and reiterates some of the basic themes of the book. In sum, Chance has brought together a group of respected researchers and theorists from a variety of scientific fields in a laudable attempt to present a multi-disciplinary discus- sion of sociality in humans and other animals. However, for the most part, the book does not succeed in advancing this discussion in an organized, cohesive fashion. The diversity in theoretical orientations and discipline-specific terminol- ogy that is represented here is simply too great an obstacle to overcome. Although the book certainly provides some solid food for thought concerning similarities in social organization across various species, the overall lack of continuity tends to detract from the importance of some of the contributions made by individual authors. In this case, the whole seems to be somewhat less than the sum of its respective parts.</page></plain_text>
