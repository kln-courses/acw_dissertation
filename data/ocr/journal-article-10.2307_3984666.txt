<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stickeen and the Moral Education of John Muir Ronald H. Limbaugh University of the Pacific More than a century has passed since John Muir and a mongrel dog named Stickeen crossed a treacherous Alaskan glacier on a stormy day in the summer of 1880. The story of that singular day, perfected by numerous retellings and published 17 years later in a popular national magazine, became one of Muir's best-known nature adventures. The story unfolded during Muir's second trip to Alaska, following close on the heels of his first exploration of Glacier Bay in the fall of 1879. With him were three native Alaskans and a missionary friend, S. Hall Young. They remained in camp while Muir and the dog trekked across the glacier. Although details of the story changed over a 15-year period, the dog remained central to the tale both in its oral and written form. In the most familiar version, as Muir left camp the dog tagged along despite Muir's warning words and the foul weather. Crossing the glacier diagonally by following flow lines and jumping crevasses, they reached the opposite shore, traced the path for several miles, then headed back near dusk on a different route. As darkness loomed they entered a heavily crevassed area. Some gaps could be</page><page sequence="2">26 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING jumped, others had to be crossed by straddling or gingerly stepping on icy connecting bridges which Muir smoothed with his ice axe for Stickeen's benefit, while still others required long looping detours. Soggy from the rain, without food since the breakfast bread, nearly exhausted from the long walk and handicapped by the dimming twilight, Muir and the dog soon found themselves stranded on an island with the only escape a badly deteriorated spiny bridge. How they made it across is the thrilling climax. The manuscript Muir ultimately prepared for publication was not a true-life adventure but an allegory on the worth of animals and their importance to mankind. That fiction grew from fact is clear by comparing Muir's original narrative in his 1880 journal with the final draft he submitted to Century in 1897. The most striking difference is the total lack of any reference to a dog in the 1880 journal, directly or indirectly. Did Stickeen really exist or was he a product of the author's fertile imagination? That was the question I first asked after deciphering the badly smudged and nearly illegible original journal, accessible to scholarsonly since the l970sand nowavailableon microfilm.1 But surely the dog was real; his presence was confirmed by the testimony of Muir's missionary companion, S. Hall Young, whose own book on Muir is filled with Stickeen references from the 1880 trip and who cooperated with Muir in writing a reminiscence about the dog. Then why did Muir leave the dog out of his original written account? The most plausible answer is that he never recognized the dog's importance until the early Nineties. In the intervening years he had become a gentleman farmer with a handsome income and an indulgent wife. As the son-in-law and business partner of Dr. John Strentzel, physician and pioneer horticulturist in the Alhambra Valley just south of Martinez, Muir had new responsibilities but also new opportunities. Muir scholars tend to exaggerate the frustrations Muir experienced in the 1880s. Exchanging the wild Yosemite days for a prosperous life in Alhambra Valley was a willful act that brought with it security and fortune, things he had never known before. Now down from the mountains, he traded the book of nature for the literal book, the aggregate knowledge of mankind bound in cloth and hard leather. His expanding book collection was indicative of his intellectual growth, both made possible by time and affluence, two precious gifts he received from his generous new partners the Strentzels. They gave him the instruments of a new education, and he richly repaid them by mastering the practical science of horticulture even as he submersed himself in the literature of the western world. The fortune he earned as a fruit farmer paled in comparison to the wealth of knowledge he</page><page sequence="3">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 27 gleaned from hisbooks. Theybroadened and deepened his perspective on nature and life. The man who wrote the dog story in the 1890s was more reflective and philosophical than the effervescent explorer of earlier years. John Muir told his friends Stickeen was the hardest story he had ever composed. Reading it nearly 80 years later I could not understand why at first. After all, from a writer's perspective the storyline is uncomplicated. Drafting a first-person descriptive narrative of an exciting single event was one of my first assignments as a college freshman. After nearly 20 years of working with the Muir Papers, reading all the preliminary manuscripts and relevant correspondence, tracing the origins of key words, ideas and phrases, and following the convoluted literary spoor left behind in the marginalia and endnotes of over 100 books from his personal library, I have begun to understand what Muir meant.2 The Stickeen story evolved over a 15-year period after the adventure of 1880. For thirteen of those years Muir told the story repeatedly to family and friends, yet apparently thought little more about it until Robert Underwood Johnson, Century's associate editor, cajoled him into writing "the dog and glacier story in your livliest [sic] style.. ."3 Muir eventually promised he would, but for two years was distracted by other obligations, including the completion of his first book, The Mountains of California. By the spring of 1895 he was ready to start in earnest on what he called the "Canis project." For more than two years he worked, intermittently but intensely, on what he considered the hardest writing job of his career. Scholars can follow his tortuous literary labors through both the books he used for inspiration and the manuscripts and notes he prepared as preliminary steps to drafting a manuscript. They can also trace his struggle through two separate notebooks and numerous draft fragments he left behind.4 What is most significant is not the mechanical details but the intellectual growth revealed in the process. All of Muir's creative energies went into the writing of Stickeen. What began as a simple adventure story- the kind R.U. Johnson had in mind for Century-ended in a profoundly moving narrative, a classic commentary on the rights of animals and their place in nature. Why this shift? The answer lies in Muir's psychic struggles after he began working in earnest on the dog narrative. What was the real meaning of the 1880 adventure? As he labored that question drove him deeper into philosophical and psychological and ethical dimensions. Johnson wanted a simple descriptive narrative, just the way he remembered Muir telling it. But Muir realized that was no longer</page><page sequence="4">28 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING enough. As a free-lance writer for a popular magazine he was bound by the prescriptive guidelines of its editor, but he wanted to educate as well as entertain. His reading and reflection since 1880 had sharpened his thinking about animals and their role in nature. Evolution Controversy: The Context for Stickeen Stickeen was now more than just a dog; he was a messenger, a harbinger of good news about the natural world. It was a timely message. The story of Stickeen emerged out of the intellectual foment of the 1890s, a disruptive decade of panic and depression, industrial exploitation and labor violence, class consciousness and racism, imperialism and war. Accompanying these unsettling economic and social forces were profoundly disturbing scientific and intellectual challenges. After a generation of controversy, Darwinism still headed the list.5 American society at the turn of the century generally accepted the evidence of evolution but was deeply divided over its implications. Humans and animals were closely related, but was that good or bad? Pessimists portrayed a dim future. To them Darwinism meant a literal descent of man to the level of animals, a Hobbesian confirmation that underneath the ethical facade were baser instincts that controlled human behavior. They lamented the loss of divinity, the moral as well as physiological diminution of the human species. Man now had little to look forward to but the bleak "struggle for existence" like his cousin thebrute. Novelists explored the dark side of human nature in fantasies such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and in realistic novels such as McTeague and Maggie: Girl of the Streets. Henry Adams summed up the somber implications: "In plain words, Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dream of man."6 Optimists, in contrast, found ways to cushion society from such negative forebodings. One way was to tone down the materialist implications of Darwinism. Even Darwin himself was unwilling to openly reject theism.7 Perhaps the human spirit, if not the human body, still contained the divine spark, the promise of dignity and nobility and progress. A whole new era of post-Darwinian Christian activism, led by Protestant liberals and modernists, developed from this premise.8 John Muir, a lifelong student and admirer of Darwin, saw only the bright side. To him the ennobling qualities of life in humans and the higher animals confirmed the divine spark. Beauty and harmony in the physical world were patent evidence of a benevolent and loving creator. Instead of demonstrating might makes right, evolution was purposive, ongoing and progressive, all part of the divine plan.</page><page sequence="5">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 29 Another Darwinian riposte was to elevate the moral status of animals. Using animals to teach moral truths was nothing new in literature. Nature writing in the 1890s expanded upon a premise explored a half-century earlier by Romantic primitivists: nature was a source of moral truth, free from the corrupting influences of ignoble humanity. To Americans in the Victorian era raw nature was less appealing than pastoral nature, tamed and modified by human hands but still embodying primal virtues.9 Even the family pet might have admirable mental and moral qualities. The result was a new literary genre, the noble animal story.10 Stickeen thus emerged reborn on paper, a dog with deeper and more enduring elements of character than had been observed in life or described by word of mouth. The new Stickeen required some remodeling and a certain amount of poetic license. But Muir was convinced the dog story could be shaped into a powerful didactic instrument, a tool to help Americans understand and appreciate their fellow creatures. Muir and the Great Chain of Being Stickeen's moral worth rested not on the logic of Darwinian materialism but on Muir's belief that all living things are linked by a chain of creation. Adapted from Greek epistemology by Christian theologians to explain the origin and organization of life in the universe, the "Great Chain of Being" theory influenced Western thought from the 8th to the 18th century." Extolled by medieval and Enlightenment scientists, philosophers and poets alike, it postulated a coherent and preordained sequence of creatures beginning with the lowest and ascending in orderly steps to the ultimate creator-god. Chain theory slowly disintegrated after 1800 as empirical science exposed the fallacy of a priori assumptions about the natural world, but not before it was "temporalized" and energized by the Romantic emphasis on individuality. Instead of a static and finitecreation, Romanticsconceived of a boundless and dynamic process of creativity that found underlying unity in diversity-thus opening the door to evolutionary thinking without utterly destroying the religious premise on which chain theory was based. Emerson led the way, asserting in "Correspondences" that: the universe is represented in every one of its particles. Everything in nature contains all the powers of nature. Everything is made of one hidden stuff; as the naturalist sees one type under every metamorphosis, and regards a horse as a</page><page sequence="6">30 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING running man, a fish as a swimming man, a bird as a flying man, a tree as a rooted man. Each new form repeats not only the main character of the type, but part for part all the details, all the aims, furtherances, hindrances, energies, and whole system of every other.12 Post-Darwinian creation-scientists like Asa Gray, Alfred Russell Wallace and John Muir had little trouble reconciling empirical biology with belief in a purposive and harmonious universe.13 They took their cue from Darwin himself, who initially found no contradiction between physiological evolution and the idea of a divine Master Plan. Muir noted with approval a passage from Darwin's "Beagle" journal, speculating that a systematic study of ovenbirds in Bahia Blanca "ultimately may assist in revealing the grand scheme, common to the present and past ages, on which organized beings have been created."'14 All life was still linked and unified by a cosmic chain, but the chain had become more organic than linear. Through the books of his personal library Muir absorbed the ideas of numerous defenders of the Chain, including Addison, Pope, Goldsmith, Kant, Herder, Schiller, Swedenborg, Emerson, Thoreau, and Carlyle. Holographic notes and marginalia show how important chain theory was to the development of Muir's own thinking. From Emerson's words quoted above Muir formulated his own general theory of oneness, insisting, like Emerson, that "all of Nature is found in man. Squeeze all the universe into the size &amp; shape of a perfect human soul &amp; that is a whole man."15 In the back of a volume of Asa Gray's scientific papers, Muir noted the Harvard botanist's affirmation of the "Infinite Variety in Unity which characterizes the Creators works&gt;'16 In Carlyle's Life of John Sterling, Muir underscored Sterling's reference to the "sense of a oneness of life and power in all existence," but rephrased it to the "sense of a oneness of life &amp; destiny in all existence.",17 An original aphorism Muir pencilled in Wallace's metaphysical treatise The World of Life expresses even more directly the influence of chain theory on the California Scot: "Every cell, every particle of matter in 0 [the world] requires a Captain to steer it into its place JM."18 Finally, in the midst of a lengthy series of Stickeen notes written on the endpages of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, Muir tried to draft a more explicit statement on oneness: Like a voice from the upper heights came the message you &amp; I are one/ Through so humble a medium came the apostolic message dog &amp; man all animals/ &amp; man are one/ Looking into</page><page sequence="7">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 31 the eyes/ watching the attitudes of snakes bedbugs etc., I felt dimly that no line of demarcation separated us.19 Here Muir's creator imagery blurred the distinctions between species and asserted a biocentric view of life in the cosmos. Peel back superficial differences and life forms become indistinguishable, either by the nature of their essences or by their moral worth. This was the central message Muir found in reassessing the meaning of Stickeen. The logic of the Great Chain of Being led him to a reaffirmation of the moral equality of dogs and men and all other elements in the endless span of creation. In an advanced draft of the dog manuscript he reinforced the point in a mystical acknowledgment of Stickeen's role as heavenly messenger: The vast mysterious chain of being-about as little known as are the inhabitants of other stars. That they should in such lively demonstrative multitudes be with us &amp; remain so strangely apart from us is most wonderful.20 Pre-Darwinian Views of the Moral Worth of Animals Stickeen was thus a special dog, an individual personality with inherent worth. Muir's nature writing, flowing from what has been called the humanitarian branch of the conservation movement, asserted the individuality of animals both as a way to uplift their moral value in the eyes of the reading public, and as a ploy against utilitarian conservationists who sought scientific studies of animal populations and who tended to treat animals as objects to be "managed" like forests and grasslands.21 The humanitarians deplored the depersonalization of species and emphasized individual personality characteristics. "It is the denial of 'personality' to animals that is at the root of the evil," wrote Henry Salt, one of the more outspoken humanitarians.22 By appealing to reader sympathies, humanitarians helped expand popular interest in the cause of animal rights. Yet by describing individual animal characteristics in anthropomorphic terms, many popular writers enveloped nature with a Romantic gloss.23 In his study of nature Muir stood somewhere between the scientific method and unadulterated anthropomorphism. By describing the dog's personality traits Muir sought to make his nature and actions more understandable to the ordinary reader of popular magazines. His friend John Burroughs also recognized the need to observe and describe animals in human terms, but warned against trying to make more out</page><page sequence="8">32 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING of animal behavior than the facts warranted. He scornfully rejected the anthropomorphic characterizations of most Romantic nature writers, but praised Muir's story for elucidating animal character without stretching credulity. "It is true that Muir makes his dog act like a human being under the press of great danger," he wrote, but the action is not the kind that involves reason; it only implies sense perception, and the instinct of self-preservation. Stickeen does as his master bids him, and he is human only in the human emotions of fear, despair, joy that he shows.24 But Burroughs did not know the original Stickeen, the dog Muir described in the first written version which his editor, Robert Underwood Johnson, gutted. That version implied the dog had more than mere "sense perception." Burroughs, Muir, Wesley Mills and other contemporary naturalists drew conclusions based on field observations of individual specimens, but they leaned toward evidence that was anecdotal rather than empirically testable. Sustained field observation, rather than laboratory testing, was the approved method of nature study in late 19th century.25 Studies of animal behavior moved from the field to the laboratory only with the development of modern comparative and experimental psychology after 1900.26 Yet the old ways died hard, as John Burroughs demonstrated in criticizing lab tests. They "prove what the animal does not know and cannot do under artificial conditions, but do they show what it does know and can do under natural conditions?"27 Muir would have thought it a fair question. He was no specialist on dogs, but after nearly a month of togetherness in the field he believed he knew Stickeen thoroughly. Muir's moral egalitarianism drew him closer to activists in the cause of animal rights. Like so many other modernist trends near the turn of the century, the late Victorian movement for animal rights grew out of the foment over the intellectual and moral implications of natural selection. Before Darwin the Christian world had been dominated by the dogmas built upon classical Greek philosophy which posited the moral superiority of humans over animals. Plato's distinction between mind and body not only exalted humans as the only creatures with souls but also gave them a loftier material status. They were, in effect, gods in an animal body. While disputing Plato's taxonomy, Aristotle also elevated humans by defining them as the highest order in the animal kingdom. He endowed both humans and animals with souls, but distinguished between the immortal soul of the human species and</page><page sequence="9">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 33 the material soul of animals which died with the body. For much of western history, animals had no place in the hereafter and thus no moral worth.28 Moral and biological superiority, however, did not justify mistreatment. Medieval Christian stewardship doctrine, exemplified by the teachings of St. Francis-to some eco-philosophers the patron saint of the modern environmental movement29-sanctified the protection of animals from wanton cruelty.30 Regardless of whether they had souls the higher animals, at least, felt pain, and it was an egregious sin to consciously expose any creature to needless suffering. Sympathy for animals surrendered during the 18th century Enlightenment to the mechanistic rationalism of Rene Descartes. He reduced all but human life to the status of "dumb" animals or plants. Even though both animals and man were machines, he wrote, only humans had souls and only souls were sentient.31 By asserting the primacy of human over all other life forms, Cartesian dualism reinforced the idea of human progress at the expense of less worthy objects. From Descartes to Darwin the industrial revolution swept across the western world, sanctified by an anthropocentric and masculine philosophy and armed with new technology that accelerated nature's conquest and domination. In this 200-year era Romanticism was the only popular intellectual movement to challenge the logic of exploitation, but much of its psychic energy was siphoned off in sentimental appeals on behalf of life's downtrodden, including slaves, orphans, aborigines, imbeciles, women and "dumb" animals. In the meantime Cartesian dualism came under increasing pressure from moral philosophers and materialists. John Locke, David Hartley and Etienne de Condillac, forerunners of modern animal psychology, did not reject dualismbut recognized "continuous degrees of intelligence at various levels of the scale of beings." De la Mettrie's sensational L'Homme machine (1748), proposed a wholly mechanistic view of the chain of being, with all mental functions having physiological origin and "with no break in the continuum from crude matter through plants and animals to man."32 Up to the mid-19thcentury the emergng disciplines of psychology and biology struggled to reconcile the idea of a continuous chain with older notions that separated mind from matter. Then came Darwin and the revolutionary implications of natural selection. By the l890sDarwinismhadnearlydemolishedbothCartesian and Romantic views of the animal-man relationship. In trumpeting the common biology of animals and humans, radical Darwinians, as distinguished frompost-Darwinian creationists, replaced transcendental</page><page sequence="10">34 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING metaphysics with materialism. Even if Darwin himself was reluctant to publicly abandon creationism, his German apostle Ernst Haeckel was much bolder. He antagonized both Neo-Platonists and orthodox Christians by insisting that all higher brain functions, like all motor functions, evolved from lower organisms.33 The Darwinian Impact on Stickeen Despite resistance of theists like Muir, the implications of Haeckel's uncompromising materialism extended the debate over the causes of animal behavior as well as the moral status of animals. The holographic marks and margin notes in books Muir read during this era demonstrate how closely he followed these debates. They also show his effort to expand the dog story into a larger study of animal behavior and its lessons for humanity. Darwinians raised four troubling issues of special interest to Muir: the ethical relationship between humans and animals, the nature and extent of animal intelligence, the status of the soul in higher animals, and the rights of animals. By insisting that sentience was a product of natural selection common to all higher animals along with ganglia and the central cortex, strident evolutionists cast a shadow over traditional ethics that ignored or discounted non-human species. If making others suffer is unethical, any being that can experience pain deserves respect and consideration. Jeremy Bentham had first postulated this principle in the late 18th century, and it was taken up in earnest in the renewed debates of the 1890s.34 The debate over the question of sentience led to a renewed dispute over the question of animal intelligence. Muir's belief in the cognition of animals found common ground with Haeckel and other Darwinians who rejected Cartesian logic along with Romantic sentiment. Both had assumed animal behavior was motivated solely by instinct. But if humans and animals have similar nervous systems and brain functions, why should reasoning ability be exclusively human? Darwin and his "bulldog", Thomas Huxley, found it difficult to reject that logic.35 They were reinforced by other post-Darwinians, including George Romanes, a pioneer in the field of comparative psychology, who wrote in 1883 that "common sense" suggests animals and humans may develop similar "mental states." In a passage Muir read and underscored, Romanes extrapolated from that premise to explain animal intelligence by a modernized version of chain theory:</page><page sequence="11">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 35 Just as the theologians tell us-and logically enough-that if there is a Divine Mind, the best, and indeed only, conception we can form of it is that which is formed on the analogy, however imperfect, supplied by the human mind; so with 'inverted anthropomorphism' we must apply a similar consideration with a similar conclusion to the animal mind.36 Filled with anecdotes describing animal behavior analogous to that of humans in species ranging from insects to primates, Romanes' study made a deep impression on Muir.37 He was particularly interested in the chapters on bees and dogs-both species he had personally investigated. Although cautioning himself in an endnote on a backpage of Romanes' book that "Analogies in nature studies [are] apt to be misleading,"38he nevertheless found in the Romanes tract reinforcement for his conviction that Stickeen's action on the glacier was more than mere instinct. "The reasoning displayed by dogs may not always be of a high order," wrote Romanes in a passage Muir found of special interest, "'but little incidents, from being of constant occurrence among all dogs, are the more important as showing the reasoning facility to be general to these animals."39 Applying this conclusion to Stickeen, Muir wrote on the back pages of Romanes' book: Can we conceive any human being reasoning more correctly under the desperate circumstances than Stick[een] / Not from a mere love of anecdote do I write this but to throw light on the vast animal world/ The fear of thoughts &amp; feelings that I saw [under a stem death &amp; life press) in this lit[tle] d[og] cannot I think fail to interest every human thinker/ Never as far as I know had a d[og] ever before been confronted by so stem &amp; fateful a problem... .all his movements &amp; gesturesbecame fairly luminous with reason &amp; intelligence.40 Muir and the Movement for Animal Rights If animals could think like humans did they also have fundamental rights? The moral implications of Darwinism were not lost on a new coalition of animal rights activists who emerged as the 19th century closed. One of the most vocal-and widely-read-was an English liberal, Henry S. Salt, whose 1892 treatise summed up the new case for animal rights. By setting humans apart from animals, by denying animal immortality or sentience, said Salt, Christian dogma and Cartesian epistemology share the blame for centuries of animal</page><page sequence="12">36 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING indifference and cruelty. Now science has demonstrated that animals and humans share a similarbiological heritage. Extrapolating from that premise, Salt concluded that animals have "individuality, character, reason; and to have those qualities is to have the right to exercise them, insofar as surrounding circumstances permit."'41 Salt's impassioned plea called public attention to issues that had been debated for years among intellectuals both in Europe and the U.S. Before Darwin, sympathy for "dumb" animals was the common denominatorby which animal advocates appealed for better treatment. Darwinism added a new twist by strengthening the argument of activists who asserted animals were intelligent as well as morally equivalent to humans. A revolutionary affirmation, indeed, but conditioned by the pragmatic realities of "surrounding circumstances." Like other moral reformers, animal rights activists had to overcome the inertia and indifference of established traditions and institutions. The church, the political system, the schools, mass opinion-all resisted change. Animal rights sounded ominous to the working man, especially if he depended on animal exploitation for a livelihood. Even Darwinism itself could be used to work against social intervention for any reason. By drawing dubious analogies between natural selection among species and "survival of the fittest" in human society, English sociologist Herbert Spencer transformed Social Darwinism into a justification for economic and social laissez-faire. Thus public indifference, even public hostility, greeted early advocates of animal rights. Before corrective action could be taken the movement needed to gather allies, to build a broad base of sympathy and support. Muir's extant library does not contain Salt's 1892 treatise, but the book may have been one of the 500 lost after 1914. That Muir and Salt knew the work of each other, however, is more than just surmise: the Muir papers contain correspondence from Salt after 1900, and one of Salt's later books, personally inscribed by the author and annotated by Muir in endnotes, resides in the Holt-Atherton Library. Muir shared Salt's view on the deleterious effects of Christian dogma, the damage done by Cartesian dualism, and the need to recognize and respect animal rights. But he went beyond Salt and most humanitarians in defending predators.42 Twenty years before Salt's publication, Muir proclaimed rights for all living things: Ours is an age [of] liberal principles yet we find but little charity that is broad enough to include bears. A Burns may step outside the selfish circle of his species with sympathy for a</page><page sequence="13">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 37 suffering daisy or to claim the mousie as fellow mortal but in the smug highwalled realms of the civilized such souls are rare indeed &amp; it is boasted as a grand consumation [sic] of "universal charity" that now all the human race black brown &amp; yellow are recognized as in some sence [sic] brethern capable of christianity &amp; even admissible to the Anglo Saxon heaven, but bears are allowed no part nor loft in our celestial regions &amp; are begrudged the air &amp; light... all long toothed poisonous uneatable uncivilizable animals &amp; plants which carry prickles are vaguely considered diabolical or.. .in some way referrable to man's first disobedience....Man forms but a small portion of the great unit of creation &amp; bears &amp; snakes have rights as well as he.43 Despite growing interest in protecting animals, the Victorian world was not ready for such revolutionary ethics. Most of Muir's statements defending predators remained in the closet during his lifetime, and even his literary executors were reluctant to reveal the real Muir.44 Salt, however, had no such qualms. His 1892 publication, even though it stopped short of calling for predator rights, established his reputation as a leader of the animal rights movement. By that time Muir was also famous but much less controversial. His popularity rested on carefully crafted published descriptions of the beautiful western wilds where he had wandered and preached the gospel of preservation. Thousands had read his eloquent prose in Scribners and Harpers and Century; they knew himnot as a revolutionary but as the spokesman for America's rich natural heritage. And they were willing listeners if not ready converts, for the 1890s was an era of reflection, a time for soul-searching and reassessment. If the nation owed its greatness to the frontier, as Frederick Jackson Turner asserted, what would the future offer now that the frontier was but a memory? Muir's charming portraits of redwood giants and sublime vistas and animal personalities tamed the Wild West with evocative word pictures. He was a popularizer, a spokesman for the picturesque, a naturalist with a national following. Both he and his editors recognized the power of his persuasive but gentle rhetoric. But there were also penalties for popularity. Writing for the masses placed boundaries on literary discretion. Johnson's editorial hand kept Muir confined to words and themes and values the American people were ready to read. But Salt's work and the animal rights movement stirred Muir's conscience and rekindled the revolutionary fires that smoldered within. The momentum for change seemed to be leaning his way: witness the string of recent conservation victories-the new park bills for Yosemite</page><page sequence="14">38 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING and Sequoia, and the foundingof the Sierra Club. If he could popularize conservation perhaps he could do the same for animal rights. The trick was to challenge traditional attitudes in an unoffensive way; to reach the public'sheart witha sentimental storythat unobtrusively introduced radical concepts. That was a formidable task that infinitely complicated the writing of Stickeen. Even demonstrating the dog's intelligence was made more difficult by Johnson's insistence upon following literary conventions. To retain theelement of surprise, the Centuryeditor wanted Muir to introduce Stickeen as a "dull" dog with little hint of intellect until confronted by thegreatcrevasse. For months the author struggled to find just the right phrase. On the backpages of books, on tablets and scraps of paper he tried out various combinations: "Serenity seemed onlydullness"5 "a dull sleepy sagacity";46 "dull glum feeble dignity";47 "the little dull dumbness of a dog"A8 "a dull silly semi-imbecile look";49 and the more alliterative "small black dumpling of dullness."50 After at least 60 different expressions he finally settled on six separate characterizations of the dog's evident dim-witted behavior in the 1897 final draft. Johnson cut those down to three in the published version. Thus the little dog on the wrong side of the abyss was an unknown entity, a canine "of the dull solemn kind",51 ponderous and stoical, an unlikely object of human interest or concern. Why was he so insipid? The primitivist in Muir initially claimed the dog was "dulled by civilization",52 but on second thought 19th century Alaska was hardly the place to stake that claim. By the final draft he vaguely attributed it to the heritage of "generations of downtrodden ancestors" worn out by hard work and hunting.53 The Soul and Animal Immortality A dog with hidden intellectual powers, that was the message. To cross the crevasse, courage had to conquer fear, inspiration to triumph over instinct. But courage and inspiration were more than just discrete intellectual gifts. They were attributes of the soul, the central "organizing principle" that gave meaning to much of mankind in the late Victorian era.54 Darwinian materialism had undermined the metaphysical pedestal on which the soul rested, yet the defenders of tradition fought back in popular journals like Nineteenth Century and Atlantic Monthly. The result was a resurgent debate over the nature, existence and immortality of the soul, a dialogue that reached its peak during the writing of Stickeen.</page><page sequence="15">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 39 Defenders of tradition had to respond to two types of criticism. One came from materialists like Huxley and Haeckel who either insisted that all psychic processes follow the "law of substance", or who took refuge in Voltairian agnosticism. To "cultivate your own garden" meant avoiding irrelevant metaphysical questions.55 The other type was less materialistic but equally disturbing, for it granted the existence of souls but heretically broadened the concept to include the higher non-human species. All things were related by a common substance, but did that include mind as well as matter, and did each level of life contain all the attributes of the soul? Emerson had opened a metaphysical Pandora's Box by finding a common denominator in the "hidden stuff" with which all things are created. Other creationists also saw the logic of continuity, especially as Darwinism continued to chip away at theoretical distinctions between humans and other animals. If there were no differences in material substance why should there be differences in spirit? Huxley in the 1870s had preferred an organic distinction: evolution explains consciousness, but higher brain functions, i.e. the soul, may develop only at the higher stages of evolution. But lest religionists take comfort in believing animals "do not possess immortal souls," he admitted that his theory would not "prevent any one from entertaining the amiable convictions ascribed by Pope to his untutored savage, that, when he passed to the realms of the blessed, his faithful dog should bear him company."56 Muir had probably read and enjoyed Pope's anecdote as much as Huxley. On the immortality of dog souls he stood four-square with the savages. While conventional America was not prepared to go that far, Muir found a sympathetic ear among old friends in the nearby Berkeley Hills. One was Sarah J. McChesney, an Oakland feminist and director of the Oakland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Twenty years after Muir had boarded in the McChesney household while drafting his Sierra glaciation theories, Mrs. McChesney boldly spoke out on the implications of Darwinism. To an enquiring reporter she said evolution had reversed Cartesian logic. If soulswere necessary for sentience, then 'most assuredly' animals had souls. The remark of course had religious implications, for orthodox Christianity denied that animals were immortal. On that question both McChesney and her colleague, Charles B. Holbrook of the San Francisco SPCA, boldly asserted that dogs and other sentient animals had a rightful place in heaven.57 That same logic could also be used against anti-feminists who denied that women had souls. This was simply a religious extension of</page><page sequence="16">40 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING Cartesian theory, based on the pre-Darwinian premise that souls were necessary for sentience and that women were less sentient than men. Mrs. McChesney's reported remarks stopped short of challenging the conventional western religious view of women, but another Muir friend was more outspoken. Mary McHenry Keith, a San Francisco attorney and wife of Muir's closest friend William Keith, played a prominent regional role in the cause of women's rights.58 She was also an animal rights activist, asserting, with Sarah McChesney, that animal sentience no longer could be disputed. In response to a reporter's inquiry she boldly linked the cause of women and animals. Both were sentientbeings with immortal souls. Mrs. Keith even suggested western Christianity could learn something from Hindu teachings on the "transmigration of souls" after death.59 Muir closely followed the debates on Darwin and religion in the press and kept an extensive clipping file. While ambivalent on the question of women's rights, the arguments by McChesney and Keith augmented his own thoughts on animal sentience, and he tried to incorporate them into the Stickeen story. He was intrigued by metempsychosis, the belief that animal and human souls "transmigrate" after death into another life form. It was an old idea, traced back at least as far as Pythagoras in the western world and ancient Hindu philosophy in the East.60 The concept fostered belief in the immortality of souls and also laid the cornerstone for a broader ethic that respected all living things. In the West, faith in incarnate immortality, if not reincarnation, remained a fundamental tenet of Christianity long after the transmigration theory declined. But the notion resurfaced and gained considerable attention by the 1890s as part of the backwash of Darwinism. Could the soul of Stickeen be human in origin? That was one of the questions Muir now asked himself as he worked on the manuscript. That the dog had a soul was to him beyond doubt, but would elevating it to human status make the idea more palatable to his readers? As the plot of the story began to take form, he conceived the ice bridge as a metaphor for baring the soul. The moment of truth came in Stickeen's decision to cross the bridge. Here was the crisis that "like white light laid the mind and soul bare."61 "Now his whole soul &amp; body to the end of every hair was revealed."62 What Muir perceived was a confirmation of oneness, a symbolic union of human and animal. For in beholding the soul of the little dog, Muir saw himself. Stickeen was a boy growing up, a child suddenly transformed bycrisis. The glacier journey was a metaphor for life, with Muir and the dog at the height of danger reduced to a single entity, a merging of mind and spirit, a coalescence of the primal</page><page sequence="17">1991 RONALD H. LIMBAUGH 41 elements of creation. "Soul of our soul," wrote Muir in an 18% passage!63 In the back of George Eliot's Wit and Wisdom he expressed it differently: "Under the stress of this supreme trial Stickine became a living human soul."64 If the bridge was the connecting link between the species, the abyss symbolized the dark unknown, the void of superstition and fear that separates human from other life forms. Bridging the gap represented not only oneness and immortality-a uniting of souls in a spiritual victory over death-it also signified a "triumphant joy of deliverance"65 over the netherworld of ignorance that prevented mankind from recognizing its physical and spiritual kinship with the rest of creation. Leaving the void behind was symbolic affirmation of the human- animal bond. With dog and man as one, Muir came back to the transmigration theory and tested it out on paper, first in the back of Hawthorne's Our Old Home, then in his 1896 draft notes. "No wonder the belief is so wide of the transmigration of souls &amp; everybody obsessed with psychological speculations as to whether they have souls," he wrote in Hawthorne.6" By 1896 he had worked that cumbersome passage down into a terse: "No wonder so many believe the souls of men enter animals."67 In an advanced draft of 1897 he took a more precautionary tack: "No wonder so many believe or half believe the Pathagorian notion (doctrine) of transmigration of souls."68 He even worked in a Hindu reference, probably afterreading the newspaper accountof MaryKeith'sinterview. The "Little black horizontal philosopher" of earlier years was rewritten by 1897. Now Muir speculated that the dog "might be some old Hindoo [sic] philosopher" in disguise.69 Johnson deleted the transmigration paragraph before publishing the story in 1897. The question of animal souls led to the question of animal immortality. Here Muir stood solidly with Sarah McChesney and other animal rights' activists. A lifelong critic of sectarian dogmas, he rejected all arguments that smacked of speciesism. In the article citing McChesney's views, the reporter noted criticisms of Christianity for denying heaven to lower animals. "The other religions have been kinder," said the article. Picking up on that theme, Muir expanded his own views in the drafts of Stickeen. Long a student of American Indian culture, like Pope he saw the irony in contrasting "primitive" and "civilized" religions. "Even in religion animals are mostly ignored," he wrote: We throw our heaven open to every vertical mammal but close it against all the horizontal ones. Indians are more charitable.</page><page sequence="18">42 ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY REVIEW SPRING They allow their dogs to follow them into their happy hunting grounds.70 Johnson also threw out this passage, presumably on the grounds it would offend too many Century readers. From its initial telling in the 1880s to the final version submitted in 1897, Muir's dog story, like Darwin's ovenbirds, changed over time. What began as an exotic adventure evolved into a lesson in moral equality and oneness. Incorporating concepts gleaned from nearly two decades of reading and reflection, the final narrative contained unconventional ideas, some his editor in the waning Victorian years found too sensitive to publish in a popular magazine.71 But he left intact the author's bedrock lessons, the culminating wisdom of his moral education. Outspoken defender of wilderness values, John Muir was also an eloquent spokesman for animals. Convinced that dogs and other higher animals were endowed with the creator's gifts of intellect, sentience, and immortality, as proof he offered first-hand evidence gathered on a glacier in 1880 with a 'little hank of hair" named Stickeen. 1 John Muir, From Wrangell Up Cost Sum Dum Takou, etc. (AMS Journal, August 16-31, 1880), in The John Muir Papers, microform edition (Alexandria, VA: Chadwyck-Healey, Inc., 1986), Reel 26 at 02114, hereafter cited as JMP microfilm. 2 It is impossible in this abbreviated format to describe the Muir book collection or its contents in detail. Over 1,000 of the 1,600 volumes described in Muir's probate records of 1915 have been located. The bulk are now part of the John Muir Papers at the Holt-Atherton Library; another 250 are in the Huntington Library. A few scattered volumes are still in family hands. As a working library rather than a drawing-room collection, these volumes contain much of the best of late 18th- and 19th-century British and American literature, poetry, science, philosophy and history. Over 50% of the extant volumes contain Muir holograph endnotes and marginalia-a wealth of information that scholars have yet to systematically investigate. What they will find remains to be seen, although my work in deciphering Muir's Stickeen notes leaves me convinced that much of Muir's literary style and substance as both writer and nature philosopher can be traced through the books he read. 3 RU Johnson to John Muir, May 17,1894, JMP Microfilm 8/04536. 4 Although the books have yet to be duplicated and made widely available, facsimiles of the manuscript drafts and notebooks have been published as part of The John Muir Papers, 1858-1957 (Microform edition).

"Stickine" is the accepted spelling for the river and the Indian people in southeast Alaska, and was in common use both before and after the 1880s. The variant spelling Muir most often used for the dog probably because of its phonetic advantages. But he was inconsistant, especially in 1897 while he gathered data on the Stickine River and the Indians. Young's reminiscence of 1897 spells the dog's name "Stickine", and occasionally Muir did the same. His story-title of "Stickeen"' however, fixed the accepted spelling even though in the same draft he used the variant at times -which the Century editors caught before publishing. 65 This is Muir's phrase as expressed in his notes at the back of Taine's History of English Literature.
