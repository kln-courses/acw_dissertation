<plain_text><page sequence="1">DET DANSKE SPROGS HISTORIE: Forste Bind, Fra Guldhornene til Jyske Lov. By PETER SKAUTRUP. Pp. 352. Copenhagen: Gyldendalske Boghandel Nordisk Forlag, 1944. This is Volume One of a projected three-volume history of Danish, imposingly illustrated with maps, manuscripts, and monuments, not to mention famous linguists and other venerable objects. Footnotes are inconspicuously assembled in the back, along with transcriptions, grammatical expressions, and abbrevia- tions. This first volume brings Danish down from its Indo-European origins to the fixing (around 1350 A.D.) of its characteristic written and spoken norms. The account is readable, almost popular, and yet detailed enough to have definite scholarly value. Skautrup, who is professor at the new Aarhus University in Jutland, attempts to combine some of the principles of structural and social linguistics with the traditional presentation of linguistic history. He declares that he is interested both in the 'parole' and in the 'langue', in. the spoken as well as in the written language, and he regards 'the outer and inner history of language' as a substantial part of the history of a people (viii). He wants to show not only HOW, but also war language has changed, and he notes that it is necessary to make 'cross- sections' (snit) at convenient points, in order to show the 'decisive stages of linguistic development'. Danish, being a language with a long national tradition of the west European type, affords an interesting example of how a group of tribes could first be broken off from the original Indo-European unity and then develop an internal linguistic coherence of their own. The earliest documents, which are all epi- graphs in the older (Germanic) runic alphabet, date from the third century. On these we find a common Scandinavian idiom, the most conservative type of Germanic recorded anywhere. It is a tripping, vocalic sort of language, with few consonant clusters and only five vowel phonemes. It yields our author his first cross-section, the period from 200 to 600 A.D., which he calles 'lEldre urnordisk', i.e. Older Proto-Scandinavian. The second portion of the Early</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 449 Scandinavian period, 600 to 800, 'Yngre urnordisk' or Later Proto-Scandinavian, is one of extensive syncope of unstressed syllables, with accompanying mutation of stem vowels, leading to a newer and more familiar stage of the language with 9 vowel phonemes, more consonant clusters, and shorter words. The next major stage in Danish development coincides with the Viking Age (800-1100); the documents are more numerous than before, but still epigraphic, now written in the younger (Danish) runic alphabet of 16 characters. The language here is very close to the other Scandinavian idioms, especially Swedish, but its distinctively Danish traits are beginning to appear. In the last period here treated the sources flow even more plentifully, consisting in part of elaborate local law codes written on parchment in a Carolingian minuscule. This cross- section is called 'LEldre Middeldansk', or Early Middle Danish (1100-1350). Here we meet for the first time a traditional orthography, adapted by the scribes from that of medieval Latin to the sounds of Danish speech. This orthography became the focus of a spoken Danish standard, an instrument of the unified Danish kingdom, which was even then being threatened by an impending in- vasion of Low German. In this period Danish first acquired that articulatory relaxation which has made it, in the author's words, a relatively 'unemphatic' (lidet praegnant) language (224). As is well-known, Danish is the least 'Scandi- navian' of the northern languages; in quality, as in geographical location, it constitutes something of a bridge between northern and central Europe. Our author has given each of his major periods thorough and illuminating treatment: the historical background, the sources, the system of writing, the sound pattern, the development of sounds, the morphology and syntax, word formation, and vocabulary. There are many interesting observations, as when he suggests that the rise of local dialects at the end of the Viking Age resulted from a loss of mobility in the rural population; at the same time there came into being an upper class whose mobility was unlimited and which came to be the creator of a national norm of speech and writing. It is sometimes said that Danish grew up around the speech of Copenhagen; Skautrup finds its origins rather in the 'highest secular and clerical circles' (259), who had no more pe- culiarities of the dialect of Copenhagen than of any other part of the country. He finds that the written norm in use today incorporates most of the changes common to Danish speech down to about 1200, but later changes are repre- sented only partially or not at all. By 1350 the grammatical structure of spoken Danish had also reached its present stage. These facts give this volume its greatest significance: it demonstrates how the framework of a modern Euro- pean language first came into being. Close study of such a language suggests that some American linguists may have minimized the role of writing in the history of language. The Danish written norm has been more than a reflection of speech; for seven centuries it has constituted a tradition of its own, with a definite influence on the speech of the ever widening circle of literate persons and those who sought to imitate them. Even Bloomfield, who has most sharply insisted on eliminating the concept of the 'Schriftsprache', notes that in German 'the spoken standard is largely derived from the written' (Language 487).</page><page sequence="3">450 REVIEWS We lack space for a thorough critique of all the author's conclusions: most of them are well-considered and fairly traditional. He is not averse to summing up whole periods and developments, however, in rather sweeping generalizations, and it is impossible to avoid the feeling that now and then he puts the cart before the horse, or postulates more than the evidence will warrant. To explain the common changes of East and North Germanic (-jj- &gt; -ggj- etc.) or of West and North Germanic (i &gt; a) he assumes common 'tendencies' before the splitting; but they may as well have been isophones within general Germanic. He attributes most of the major changes in Danish to the fixing of the Germanic accent, including the syncope of Proto-Scandinavian (44), the umlauts (46), the morphological simplification of Old Scandinavian (52), as well as the corre- sponding weakenings in Early Middle Danish (224 ff.). One cannot deny, of course, that the fixing of the accent provided a condition under which unstressed syllables could easily lose the speaker's attention, since they were continually overshadowed by the stressed syllables. But other languages have had fixed accent without this result, e.g. Finnish and Hungarian; nor have all the Germanic languages gone through identical changes in spite of their common accent. His tendency to seek specific, immanent causes within the language for its changes is shown also in a remark to the effect that the indefinite article arose because of the development of a definite article (269); here we may contrast Icelandic, which acquired the definite without developing any indefinite article. The whole problem of causality, which crops up repeatedly, is of course a difficult one: a cause must be sufficient, and it must be selective enough so that it really explains. The results of dialect geography show that most changes come from the outside; very few of them spring up spontaneously in any one dialect; on the other hand, a change will presumably not spread unless it finds congenial predispositions in the patterns of the receiving dialects. Now Skautrup is not unaware of the relations between changes in Danish and in neighboring languages. He associates Dano-Swedish monophthongization in the 10th century with a similar change in Old Saxon and Old Frisian (130). He realizes that the Early Scandinavian syncope was associated with 'greater mobility, folk migrations', etc. (44). He notes waves of influence from Germany that brought specific customs of naming, e.g. the rise of the torp-names and the use of family names (114, 305). But it would be more than strange if other parallels between West Germanic and Scandinavian developments were not also connected, in view of the known chronology of these changes: first in Central Europe, then in Denmark, then in Sweden and Norway, and last, if at all, in Iceland. This is the true explanation of the indefinite article, as well as of the definite (as suggested by Schiltte, cited on page 140), and of the great quantity shift (as outlined by Alf Sommerfelt, Bidrag til Bondesamfundets Historie 2.322-5 [1933]). Moreover: is it probable that the rise of umlauts and the breakdown of inflections should have taken place independently in all the countries within the Northwest European culture area? A similar line of reasoning makes it difficult to follow his analysis of the 'weakening' in early Middle Danish. He attributes it to a change in accent whereby the relative stress of accented and unaccented syllables changed from</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 451 3:2 to 4:1 (in Jutland even to 4:0). Among the results of this change were the coalescence of unstressed a, i, and u as shwa, the voicing and later spirantization of postvocalic short unvoiced stops (e.g. gata &gt; ga.-a), the lengthening of short vowels in open syllable, the vocalization of voiced spirants, the growth of svarabhakti vowels, and even the rise of the glottal catch! He appears to assume, not merely a relative increase of stress in stressed syllables, but in some cases even an absolute increase, which is of course quite unprovable, and in view of the present-day low amplitude of Danish accent quite improbable. To assume such a change as the 'cause' of far-reaching phonetic modifications is to substitute one unknown for another; note that standard English, which went farther than standard Danish in its reduction of syllables, did not weaken its postvocalic stops. 'Weakened articulation' is a suitable enough NAME with which to summarize the phenomena enumerated above; it is methodically wrong to call it a 'cause', which should rather be reserved for one member of a correla- tion between two knowns. Having once postulated such a 'cause', one is led to further guesses, such as the one made by N. M. Petersen: the phonetic weaken- ing, he thought, was due to the political impotence of 13th-century Denmark! Not much better is our author's theory, though hesitantly enough presented, that since it actually took place in the 12th century, a period of Danish expansion, it might be evidence of 'a certain evolutionary strength, a release of quiet tension and speed' (255). There are other points at which one would like to ask questions. Why should one call langue 'objective' and parole 'subjective' (2), when parole is what we have objectively given and langue must be subjectively reconstructed by the linguist? What is the point of using Forchhammer's vowel block instead of the usual vowel triangle, which has at least some correlation to the shape of the vocal organs (45)? In general his exposition would have benefited greatly by a more liberal use of tables and diagrams, e.g. of IE-Germanic equivalences or of v3wel and consonant systems. What can he possibly mean by a 'flexible' (labil) system of articulation, with 'gliding entities that could be articulated in var:ous nuances, giving the possibility of development in various directions' (260)? Is it not true, as Bloomfield says (Language 281), that 'a language presents itself to us, at any one moment, as a stable structure of lexical and grammatical habits'? The Germanic languages, following Schtitte, he calls 'Gotthonic', but some- how he lapses into 'West Germanic' and 'East Germanic' in describing its divi- sions (but nordisk, i.e. 'Scandinavian', for North Germanic). He claims that the Germanic consonant shift causes 'a complete change in the linguistic system of the language' (10), which seems to this reviewer a misuse of the term system, in view of the rigid regularity of this shift. He derives Dutch and Flemish from Old Saxon, which does not agree with the usual derivation from Old Low Fran- conian (11). He does not account for the two e's in the older Runic alphabet, nor does he bring out as clearly as he might the way in which the younger Runic alphabet carried over from the old practically all the old distinctions that were retained in the language, failing only to find new symbols for the new distinctions (121). He notes the unreliability of the French statement that Rollo of Nor-</page><page sequence="5">452 REVIEWS mandy was Danish, but fails to mention the solid testimony of the Icelandic Snorri that he may have been a Norwegian (83). His location of Vinland in the northern part of Newfoundland (106) seems odd in view of the total absence in this region of the chief characteristics of that land, the wild grapes and the self-sown wheat of the earliest accounts. Most interesting is his discussion of the origin of the glottal catch. He accepts the usual theory that it is a peculiarly Danish substitute for an earlier stress pattern similar to that of Accent 1 in Norwegian and Swedish. He assumes that this had a louder peak than Accent 2, thus providing a favorable basis for the glottal closure. But the specific incitement to change, he thinks, was the previously discussed accentual shift in the 12th century, which first threatened to erase the difference of Accents 1 and 2 by eliminating the second tonal peak of the latter and then, to avoid this coalescence, differentiated Accent 1 by turning its off-glide into a glottal catch. This practically anthropomorphic theory is a development of ideas advanced by the Danish phonetician Svend Smith in 1938. Objections that the glottal catch occurs in loanwords borrowed later than 1200 Skautrup dismisses by maintaining that it could have been introduced in these by formal analogy (243). In this connection one might have hoped for a more detailed analysis of loanword phonology in general; perhaps this same principle could be applied to other traditional datings. In a part of Jutland a second glottal catch has developed in those words with Accent 2 that lost their second syllable (e.g. trakke &gt; tr.ak; 262), corresponding some- what in distribution to the circumflex tone (which is also usually an Accent 1) in the Norwegian Trdnder dialect. Jutland is clearly a center of intensity for the entire Danish 'weakening', a fact that has made it one of the least easily understood of all continental- Scandinavian dialects. At the end of the book Skautrup surveys the state of Danish in 1350, a time of political despair. He shows that the language was being rapidly developed towards a 'richer shading and greater vividness' (309). But when he attempts to describe what he considers certain 'primitive' traits in the language of that day, he shows an odd sort of linguistic nearsightedness. 'The words,' he writes, 'were still in many cases something other and more than a bare communication, a symbol; they had power in themselves.' He attributes to them a 'complex' meaning: they could be used in a 'concrete and specific sense as well as in an ab- stract or extended one.' That this is any more true in Medieval than in Modern Danish does not, however, appear from his examples, for practically all of them can be duplicated in Modern Danish (or, for that matter, in any other language). The preposition with had then three meanings: 'against', 'with', and 'from'; Modem Danish mod has just as many: 'against', 'towards', and 'to'. The adjective skyldugh meant 'obliged' as well as 'entitled to', with only the context telling the meaning; but the modern equivalent skyldig is no less 'complex', since it can mean 'obligated', 'owing', and 'guilty'. In each case there has been a shift in the range of meaning. But words in ordinary human speech are still and will presumably always be complex; and they have not yet lost their power to sway men with something more than their literal sense. Barring the reservations that have here been duly recorded, your reviewer</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 453 would bring in a verdict of satisfaction with a large task well begun and the hope that the remaining volumes may equal and even surpass the first.
