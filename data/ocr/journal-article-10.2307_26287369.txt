Where the latter coupling gleans power from the privatization and domination of nature and the hierarchal separation of human beings, Roy's narratives challenge institutions that wield power through the creation and subjugation of human and nonhuman others. The God of Small Things is arguably her most complex narrative of connection, organized on a terrain of illicit intimacies, caste politics, corporate globalization, and what I call ecological collectivity.

THE BACKWATERS SPHERE: ECOLOGICAL COLLECTIVITY, COSMOPOLITANISM, AND ARUNDHATI ROY Aarthi Vadde</page><page sequence="2">Vadde 523 the public, and the private—but also to develop formal strategies that enable readers to see these spheres as overlapping. To fully explore the revolutionary potential of Roy's narratives of connection, this essay asks how literary interrogations of the human and its concomitant institutions bring about epistemic shifts in our understanding of community, civic duty, and environmental obliga tion at the local and transnational levels. Approaching this question requires situating Roy's work at the intersection of ecocriticism and cosmopolitanism, two fields that share an asymmetrical relationship to one another. As ecocriticism grows, it becomes more attentive to the transnational contexts from which ideologies of nature emerge. Recent studies have internationalized nature by locating specific landscapes within imperial, postcolonial, or globalized networks of interdependence.1 However, cosmopolitanism in its resurgent form has yet to contend with ecocritical challenges to the human. Many of its foremost cultural critics remain untroubled by the field's an thropomorphic lens and humanist aspirations as long as they take a multicultural and minoritarian form that includes peoples once designated less than human.2 This complacency is unfortunate and even dangerous as human survival is increasingly threatened and perpetual peace infinitely deferred by ideologies and practices that permit humans' treatment of the earth to take lastingly destructive forms toward nature and those associated with it. Roy brings ecological concern and cosmopolitan outlook together in ways that few scholars have by showing how self-enclosed con structions of the human depend on the ideologies of development and progress that permeate hegemonic narratives of globalization. Her project begins at home, specifically her native state of Kerala that is the setting for her only novel, The God of Small Things. Kerala has historically been a crucial center of India's environmentalism versus development debates. It is globally renowned for its beauti ful backwaters—a network of rivers, lakes, manmade and natural canals, and estuaries that run between the Arabian Sea (Malabar Coast) and the Western Ghats, and approximately from the cities of Kollam to Kochi. The region is richly biodiverse, containing ecotones between freshwater and saltwater ecosystems and two internation ally recognized Ramsar wetlands—the Vembanad and Ashtamudi. Although fishing and agriculture have historically been the backwaters' primary industries, tourism is now the primary source of economic growth, according to the state government. Advertised by Kerala's Department of Tourism as "God's own country," the backwaters have been hailed by the National Geographic Traveler as one of the two must-see spots in India (the other being the Taj Mahal). Yet, Kerala's tourism earnings are low and remain a negligible proportion</page><page sequence="3">524 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy of its domestic economy. Tourist development in the state has been primarily the result of a particular interest group, the hotel industry, benefiting from subsidies, tax exemptions, and credit facilities at low interest rates (Sreekumar and Parayil 530). Using such incentives, the state government has created several models of public-private partnerships with such star hotel conglomerates as the Taj, Oberoi, and Casino groups (Mathew), while successfully lobbying against the central government's Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules. In 1998, a CRZ report found tourism to be a top contributor to the destruction of Kerala's coastal ecosystems (Sreekumar and Parayil 542).3 This enmeshing of state and corporate interests supersed ing ecological and local community concerns provides the modern backdrop for The God of Small Things, which juxtaposes the postco lonial era of 1960s India with the globalized era of the 1990s, when transnational capital replaced the Communist movement as the revolutionary force within Kerala. Through the course of the novel, the public institution of caste, the private desires of family, and the capitalist creeds of five-star hotel chains converge to bring about an untouchable's murder, two siblings' separation, and the ecological destruction of a rural village turned international tourist destination. Roy ties these many instances of institutionally sanctioned injustice together through her exploration of humanism as an epistemology of ascendancy derived from the desire to dominate others without understanding them and measure knowledge through certainty rather than curiosity. She finds expressions of ascendant humanism in the discourses of colonial science and aesthetics, which remain important forces within postcolonial India, particularly for the wealthy and educated. Against the logic and consequences of ascendant humanism, Roy posits a third space of subjectivity formation, which I refer to as the backwaters sphere. Unlike the traditionally divided public and private spheres of identity formation, the backwaters sphere shapes human subjectivity through cross-species solidarities. Roy founds these solidarities on her child protagonists' environmental literacy, which foils the monological approaches to entomologie taxonomy and ornamental gardening featured in the novel as reflections of their older relatives' ascendant humanism. In exploring the transgressions and solidarities of the backwaters sphere, I am not claiming that Roy's aesthetic representation of Kerala yields scientific knowledge of its ecosystems. Rather, I am arguing that Roy's narrative portrays the backwaters as a social space—an ecological collectivity where the bonds among humans are enabled and offset by bonds forged across human, animal, and vegetable lines. The backwaters as an ecological collectivity set nonhuman subjects alongside human ones, organize</page><page sequence="4">Vadde 525 human memory around environmental inscription and adaptation, and temper human ascendancy and exceptionalism by representing reason as at times dependent on (and not simply transcendental to) the sensory perceptions and cognitive skills that guide our habitation of the world. Interjecting these principles of Roy's ecological collec tivity into the economy of cosmopolitanism extends the parameters of human subjectivity and transnational political obligation into the nonhuman natural world. Such an extension is vital for conceiving nature as a sociocultural and political category and for bringing rural experiences of modernity to bear on predominantly technological measures of human progress in the era of globalization. This essay unfolds over roughly four sections. The first brings an ecocritical perspective to cosmopolitanism via an analysis of Kant's formulation of human community and nature's role in fostering social ity. By revisiting Kant, cosmopolitanism's most credited and critiqued scholar, I suggest openings for contemporary discourse to undo the human/nature divide that sustains modern thought about human community, land ownership, and development. The second and third sections move from my revision of cosmopolitanism to representations of human to nature relationships in The God of Small Things. Here, I analyze Roy's differing constructions of the human by contrasting epis temologies of ascendancy with the backwaters' ecological collectivity. The fourth section of this essay examines the continuities between Roy's fiction writing and her environmental activism, asserting that her novel's formal strategies shape the rhetoric of her cosmopolitanism in the anti-dam treatise "The Greater Common Good." In this polemical piece Roy indicts modernity's dominant institutions, specifically the Indian state and the World Bank, for despoiling the Narmada River Valley and denying ecological equity to Dalits and Adivasis, India's most disempowered and dehumanized communities. I read this treatise as a coda to her novel to convey the urgency of reforming instrumentalist and conquering views of nature. As a novelist and essayist, Roy unmasks the spurious demands for sacrifice and civic duty promulgated by politicians and corporate interests under the guise of national uplift and contends with the quiet devastation of local industries and ecologies left behind. Cosmopolitanism—An Ecocritical Revision In the landmark essay "Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch" Kant argues that perpetual peace is "guaranteed by no less an author ity than the great artist Nature herself (natura daedula rerum). The mechanical process of nature visibly exhibits the purposive plan of producing concord among men, even against their will, and even by</page><page sequence="5">526 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy the means of discord" (108). The "great artist Nature," Kant is careful to say, has a purposive function in the development of global human community. This function does not follow the same logic as divine creation; rather, purposiveness is a regulating principle that humans must "supply mentally" in order to conceive of "nature's artifices" as the relationship between "the form of things and their ultimate pur poses," in this case the guarantee of peace (109).4 Ironically, in Kant's teleology, nature guarantees peace by means of war, which drives human beings to populate all areas of the world while the finitude of the earth's surface ensures that these dispersed peoples will still have to come together in community. Thus, nature provides the impetus and ground on which humans form states, and in turn preserve peace, by developing relations of right among those states. Kant finds evidence of Nature with a capital "N" (that is nature as the formal unity that regulates humanity's being in the world) in the lowercase physical nature of the world's diverse ecologies and geographies. This is not to say that he expresses a deep appreciation for nature's diversity, but rather that he attributes such diversity to Nature's rendering of even the most inhospitable of climate zones habitable: It is in itself wonderful that moss can still grow in the cold wastes around the Arctic Ocean; the reindeer can scrape it out from beneath the snow, and can thus itself serve as nourishment or as a draft animal for the Ostiaks or Samoyeds. Similarly, the sandy salt deserts contain the camel, which seems as if it had been created for traveling over them in order that they might not be left unutilized. But evidence of design in nature emerges most clearly when we realize that the shores of the Arctic Ocean are inhabited not only by fur-bearing animals, but also by seals, walruses, and whales, whose flesh provides food and whose fat provides warmth for the native inhabitants. (110) Kant forays into the extreme environments of the Arctic and desert to make a case for Nature both enabling and constraining human existence through the "mechanical process of nature" (108). His dic tion assures us of his fundamentally anthropocentric view of physical nature with its "fur-bearing" and "draft" animals that should not be "left unutilized"—a marked difference from his larger conception of Nature as purposive. Although most scholars of cosmopolitanism cite "Perpetual Peace" when acknowledging Kant's influence, none cite these passages, which explore the roles of purposive Nature and me chanical/physical nature in enabling and fostering human community. Most likely, the elision is due to a sociological tendency for severing</page><page sequence="6">Vadde 527 the laws of man from the laws of nature and, more immediately, to the seeming irrelevance of Kant's cursory geography to the larger legacies of his political philosophy. Yet, I would argue that dismiss ing Kant's attempts to insinuate physical places into his discourse of right forecloses a potential inroad into rooting cosmopolitanism in environmental and not just metaphorical ways. David Harvey has rightly indicted contemporary scholars for valorizing specificity and particularity in cosmopolitanism but lacking the material knowledge necessary to account for cosmopolitanism's different articulations across different places. Focusing on Kant's posthumously published Physische Geographie or Geography (1804),5 he reminds us that Kant considered geography and anthropology propaedeutics, that is, necessary precursors for all philosophical and scientific knowledge. Ironically though, these propaedeutics were ultimately incompatible with Kant's larger vision of "universal ethics and cosmopolitan principles" because they raised the discomfiting question of whether such principles applied across different (and in Kant's mind inferior) races (534-35). Harvey suggests that Geography is ignored because it is "nothing short of an intellectual and political embarrassment" (532); its physical descriptions are disorganized and its anthropological ones deeply prejudiced. However, after reading "Perpetual Peace," these shortcomings should not come as a sur prise. What is more explanatory of our ignorance of Geography, and for that matter Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, is the irreconcilability of their empirical records of natural difference with the universal humanist ends of Kant's political writings. Investigating the relationship between Kant's geographical and anthropological methods and his practical philosophy reveals a re pressed ambivalence between subject and object understood as "man" and "physical nature" in Kant's oeuvre. That ambivalence is crucial to restructuring the human/nature divide animating contemporary cosmopolitanisms whose current imperatives for "partial" (Appiah xvii), "provincial" (Kumar 64-66), and "vernacular" (Bhabha ix-xxv) frameworks of global citizenship do nothing to challenge the privileged status of the human in otherwise trenchant critiques of Eurocentric universalism. By exploiting the fundamental tensions in Kant's con struction of the human, we can move toward a cosmopolitanism in which nature is intrinsically valued—a terrestrial cosmopolitanism in which particular places are not empirical afterthoughts nor is nature the "the lead strings" from which humanity must break free. Kant's Anthropology differentiated between physiological knowledge of man ("what Nature makes of man") and pragmatic knowledge ("what man makes, can, or should make of himself as a freely acting being") (3). Physiological knowledge supplemented by geographic knowledge yields knowledge of "the things in the world,</page><page sequence="7">528 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy such as animals, plants, and minerals in various lands and climates"; however, it is insufficient for becoming a "citizen of the world" (4). Such cosmopolitanism requires pragmatic knowledge of the human's own participation in the world as a rational actor rather than mere spectator. Despite these clearly articulated distinctions between physiological and pragmatic knowledge, Kant's anthropology cannot abide its own injunctions to account for the character of the human species, because it is imbued by a transcendental view of human reason. As David L. Clark argues, "For rationality is not one charac teristic of the species among many, but its exemplary origin and end, the being-human of humanity. If earthly rationality cannot be held up against its unearthly equivalent, that is if the anthropologist cannot experientially confirm the classification of 'that terrestrial being as rational,' then what can we really know of that being?" (203). This conundrum of a lack of an earthly or unearthly equivalent to the hu man was more of a blessing than a curse for Kant, whose inability to fully taxonomize man as a "terrestrial rational being" reinforced the human's exceptional nature as a subject and not object of his own knowledge and thus the most dignified of earthly creatures. Clark's incisive essay goes on to parse allusions to rational extraterrestrial beings or aliens throughout Kant's oeuvre and demonstrates that Kant's model of the human is haunted by the specter of comparison with an equivalent alien who would both complete man's knowledge of himself and shatter his solitary and grandiose position within the universe. While Clark follows Kant's upward gaze, I am more inter ested in staying within the terrestrial quagmire of the human who lacks an earthly equivalent. Kant's need for aliens highlights the intractability of his taxo nomic logic and the assumption that all comparisons must proceed through some form of equivalence. However, parting with Kant on this point and allowing for a comparative procedure based on disparity also unmoors the status of the human in ways that rational aliens cannot accomplish but empirical nature and ecological principles can. By em phasizing the persistence of difference over the recognition of same ness in comparative methods, we replace Kant's categories (which allow for the ascendancy of man and the objectification of animals, vegetables, and other "things" in nature) with eclectic relations across species and to places.6 Articulating these eclectic relations requires local material knowledge of a particular ecology and a philosophical commitment to what Édouard Glissant called "opacités consenties" in his extended theory of relation (Le discourse 245). Opacités consen ties, represented alternatively as "consensual opacities" (Melas 106) or in Michael Dash's translation as "recognized opaque structures" (Glissant, Caribbean 133), preserve heterogeneity within collectivity by necessitating concessions from those in relation; relatives, so to</page><page sequence="8">Vadde 529 speak, must consent to a mutual opaqueness, an incomplete under standing of each other that governs their connection. For Glissant, structures of opacity redefine the human: "L'humain n'est peut-être pas I' "image de l'homme" mais aujourd'hui la trame sans cesse re commencée de ces opacités consenties" [The human is perhaps not the "image of man," but today the constantly recommencing weave of these consenting opacities] (Le discourse 245). Glissant proposed this alternative image of the human as "la trame" (literally "weft") with respect to weaving a postcolonial Caribbean collectivity from the region's diversity, yet the metaphor speaks powerfully to ecological relations where humans and nonhumans certainly lack complete knowledge of each other even as they constitute a collectivity. Of course, nature cannot consent to its opacity in any translatable way, nor should it be enveloped by the weave of "l'humain." Instead, rec ognizing nature's opacity from a human perspective entails humbling biological positivism (while not excusing ignorance of nature) and measuring collectivity through the multiplicity of human to nonhuman relations regulating a specific region. In order to undo the human/nature divide then, terrestrial cos mopolitanism replaces collectivity based on shared humanity with collectivity based on the cross-species relations of particular ecolo gies. This shift challenges prevailing views of the human as perfectly exceptional and nature as perfectly objectifiable and encourages human forms of learning about nature that respect opacity. In turn, by examining human membership within ecological collectivities, ter restrial cosmopolitanism explains how peoples' livelihoods, histories, cultures, and modes of consumption are embedded in lands with non human inhabitants subject to national and transnational ownership, dispute, and exploitation. The term reminds us that cosmopolitans may be earthly as well as worldly, rural as well as urban, and offers a less entitled, hubristic, and elite vision of human habitation and transnational environmentalism. Arundhati Roy's writing contributes to terrestrial cosmopoli tanism by aesthetically reimagining nature as a new kind of private sphere in which humans come to recognize themselves as critically thinking social beings in their relationships to the land they inhabit. As I suggest in my introduction, Roy interrogates constructions of the human by contrasting epistemologies of ascendancy with the ecological collectivity of the backwaters. Where epistemologies of as cendancy reinforce a solipsistic and exceptional model of the human, ecological collectivity disputes established ideas of human sovereignty by reconceiving the human within networks of interdependence and reciprocity with the nonhuman natural world. It thus challenges the assumption that coexistence through difference is a solely human privilege and widens the purview of human ethical responsibility to</page><page sequence="9">530 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy include nonhuman bodies (animals, plants, and rivers) living inside and against the dominant order of the state and the deterritorialized forces of capitalist globalization. Epistemologies of Ascendancy Exploring The God of Small Things's critique of ascendant humanism and its attendant institutions requires first a brief plot summary. The novel's primary protagonists are the twins Rahel and Estha, whose mother Ammu, an upper-caste Syrian Christian, marries and divorces an abusive Hindu. As a divorced woman from a mixed marriage, Ammu finds herself outside prevailing family structures, forced to acknowledge that at the age of twenty-seven her "life had been lived" (38). When she returns to her family in Ayemenem (a fictional village in the Kottayam district of Kerala), she and the half caste twins occupy a precarious place among their relatives, including Ammu's widowed mother Mammachi; her divorced, Oxford-educated brother Chacko; and her embittered aunt Baby Kochamma. Rahel and Estha, often left to their own devices, spend most of their time playing by the River Meenachal,7 the main artery of the village that also separates the Ipe family home from the "Heart of Darkness" (53)—an undeveloped area containing the symbolically named His tory House and untouchable shanties. The backwaters sphere, encompassing the River Meenachal, the History House, and the untouchable settlements, becomes a refuge for the human others of Kerala's rigid caste and marriage laws. There, unsanctioned relationships flourish as Rahel and Estha find a father figure and Ammu a lover in the untouchable carpenter Velutha. The twins have no knowledge of Ammu's affair with Velutha, but when their cousin Sophie Mol drowns in the River Meenachal, their activities become entangled with the adults'. The twins, afraid of being blamed for Sophie Mol's death, hide in the History House where they see the state police beating Velutha nearly to death for allegedly raping Ammu. Velutha is then imprisoned, and the twins must bear false witness to his crimes before he dies of his wounds. When Ammu discloses her affair to the police, Chacko exiles her from Ayemenem and separates the twins. Rahel and Estha reunite in Ayemenem twenty-three years later and must confront their sup pressed traumas through the alien landscape of a village that has entered the global marketplace as a "smelly paradise, God's Own Country they called it on the brochures" (120). What this schematic retelling cannot capture is the vital role nonhuman actors play in forming Roy's characters' conceptions of agency, justice, and transgression. Readers cannot understand the</page><page sequence="10">Vadde 531 significance of Velutha's murder without first understanding the logic that permits it—a logic inspired by what Roy calls "human nature's pursuit of ascendancy" (293). We witness and understand this pursuit most thoroughly by forging a link between the spectacular violence of Velutha's death and the banal acts of violence committed against the nonhuman world by the novel's more privileged characters. Prior to the murder, ascendancy appears in its starkest forms via environ mental and animal imagery, specifically in Baby Kochamma's "fierce, bitter" ornamental garden and in Pappachi's moth (26). Baby Kochamma's garden illustrates an anthropocentric view of the environment, wherein natural beauty is a reflection of the human will's triumph over its raw materials: "She wielded an enormous pair of hedge shears in her bright-orange gardening gloves. Like a lion tamer, she tamed twisting vines and nurtured bristling cacti. She limited bon sai plants and pampered rare orchids. She waged war on the weather. She tried to grow edelweiss and Chinese guava" (27). Gardening is a violent occupation that only increases Baby Kochamma's estrange ment from the land rather than her comprehension of it. Although a native of Ayemenem, she presides over her garden like an imperial horticulturalist remaking an imagined wilderness into a global natural order of, among others, Chinese, Japanese, Swiss, and Indian plant species. Even as the garden flourishes, Roy's vocabulary suggests that Baby Kochamma's techniques do not nurture; they tame, bristle, limit, and ultimately wage war against any species or climate that would thwart her vision. With her diploma in ornamental gardening from the University of Rochester, she cultivates the land as a personal enclosure, deriving pleasure from its meticulous policing. Baby Kochamma's imported plants and passionate pruning reflect a particularly antagonistic and domineering form of human agency—one that measures success through overwriting the environ ment rather than cooperating with it. Her gardening strategies sug gest the indigenization of colonialism's epistemologies, complicating the notion that Indian subjectivities can be separated from European ones even in the aftermath of national independence. Yet, nowhere is the division between putatively Indian and English subjectivities more challenged than by Pappachi, Baby Kochamma's brother and an Imperial Entomologist at the Pusa Institute who becomes Joint Director of Entomology in the postcolonial era. Pappachi's "great est setback" comes from failing to translate a lucky break into a triumphant legacy. Specifically, he discovers a moth with "unusually dense dorsal tufts" in his drink. Convinced that it is a new species, he "mounted it, measured it," and brought it to Pusa for classifica tion, where it was deemed to be only a variation of the well-known species Lymantridae. However, after Pappachi's retirement and re</page><page sequence="11">532 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy turn to Ayemenem, "a radical taxonomic reshuffle" ensues in which lepidopterists classify the mutant moth as its own species and credit its discovery to one of Pappachi's successors (48). Within the private sphere of the Ipe family, Pappachi's moth takes on a mythical power, tormenting him and his descendants as a symbol of powerlessness and betrayal. The reclassification of Pappachi's moth exposes the shortcom ings of human approaches to nature that cannot keep pace with the contingencies of nature, namely the ways in which beings evolve, mutate, and hybridize. Pappachi's immersion in taxonomic structures of thought and faith in their rigidity become the source of his bitter ness when lepidopterists destabilize taxonomy by reexamining their own grounds of classification rather than their insect objects. Pappachi does not share in or abide by their self-reflection; consequently, he will not relinquish his claim to the moth even after it is named for someone else. He remains locked into a discourse of discovery and possession, which prevents him from viewing the moth as a being in itself, something other than a projection of his own thwarted ambi tions. However, when the legend of the moth is passed down to Rahel and Estha, their children's logic transforms the insect from an object of human knowledge to an agent of despair. Its icy legs spread over Rahel's heart when Sophie Mol drowns, and its once mounted and measured body appears "on the move" in the police inspector's office when Baby Kochamma manipulates the twins into testifying against Velutha (300). The moth's presence in these scenes translates Pap pachi's individual myopia into a community's collective blindness as the police and a powerful family collude in killing a man who threat ened the legitimacy of their social order: Unlike the custom of rampaging religious mobs or conquering armies running riot, that morning in the Heart of Darkness the posse of Touchable Policemen acted with economy, not frenzy. Efficiency, not anarchy. Responsibil ity, not hysteria. They didn't tear his [Velutha's] hair out or burn him alive. They didn't hack off his genitals and stuff them in his mouth. They didn't rape him. Or behead him. After all they were not battling an epidemic. They were merely inoculating a community against an outbreak. (293) Velutha's murder is a "clinical demonstration" of the state's obliga tion to its citizens (292). The Touchable Policemen do not beat him out of hatred or fear but with the comfortable conviction that they are protecting the community from someone who has violated the "Love Laws" of caste (33). Velutha's beating is the result of a so</page><page sequence="12">Vadde 533 cial pathology masquerading as a collective ethics, and Roy locks it into the same symbolic economy as Baby Kochamma's ornamental garden and Pappachi's moth. Each of these images present power struggles wherein civilization is safeguarded by the disciplining of plant, animal, and human others. Such seemingly incommensurate analogies—a garden to a moth to an untouchable—compel readers to see the pitfalls of taxonomic thought and to make connections across aesthetic, scientific, and social forms of violence that in the novel's epistemologies of ascendancy traffic under the guises of beauty, knowledge, and justice. Ecological Collectivity Velutha's beating takes place in the History House, an aban doned building on the undeveloped side of the River Meenachal. Before the police find him there, they search the backwaters for their target. Their hunters' gazes largely prevent them from noticing what Roy shows the reader: Beyond the swamp that smelled of still water, they [the police] walked past ancient trees cloaked in vines. Gigantic mani plants. Wild pepper. Cascading purple acumi nus. Past a deepblue beetle balanced on an unbending blade of grass. Past giant spider webs that had withstood the rain and spread like whispered gossip from tree to tree. A banana flower sheathed in claret bracts hung from a scruffy, torn-leafed tree. A gem held out by a grubby schoolboy. A jewel in the velvet jungle. Crimson dragonflies mated in the air. Doubledeck ered. Deft. One admiring policeman watched and wondered briefly about the dynamics of dragonfly sex, and what went into what. Then his mind clicked to attention and Police Thoughts returned. Onwards. (289) The rhythm of this passage alternates between poetic, alliterative depictions of the backwaters' nonhuman inhabitants and the steady march of its biologically human but robotic invaders. The idiosyn cratic detail lavished on the plants and insect life compels the reader to identify with the nonhuman actors who are individuated in ways that the "Touchable Policemen" are not. As the passage continues, one anonymous policeman is briefly "exceptionalized" not for his species's superiority but for his ability to see in the same way as</page><page sequence="13">534 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy the narrator—to be curious about and even admire the ways of a "fellow creature" (293), until his mind clicks to attention and "Police Thoughts" replace fascination. This passage, with its minute descriptions of a usually invisible world, is typical of Roy's prose style, which places a premium on centralizing the marginal. To "watch and wonder" about dragonfly sex humanizes the policeman while to "click to attention" betrays a mechanistic single-mindedness that hinders justice rather than ex ecutes it. Roy's ecocentrism arises then out of her desire for a more ethical humanism; she suggests that violence might be thwarted if only we recalibrate our sense of the crucial and the trivial, of those who matter and those who are expendable. Such a recalibration can not come from the usual corners of bourgeois subjectivity, for the absolutist notions of "Structure. Order. Complete monopoly" govern the public and private spheres of Ayemenem (293). Consequently, Roy designs the backwaters sphere as an ecological collectivity with alternative organizing principles for interdependence, pedagogy, his tory, and belonging. Belonging in the public sphere is measured by citizenship; how ever, the rights of the citizen are variously denied Roy's protagonists. Velutha is an untouchable, Ammu has no "Locusts Stand I" (56) or locus standi (place of standing) after her divorce; Rahel and Estha are children, coerced into the civic duty of testimony via a conspiracy of lies. Each falls through the cracks of the various institutional edi fices meant to contain and support them, causing them to turn away from legal structures of belonging. As an alternative to Ayemenem's governing codes, the backwaters' ecological collectivity offers Rahel and Estha nonviolent and nonascendant forms of human knowledge ascertained through their environmental literacy. The twins' trau matic induction into public life is brought into relief by their success in learning the geography of the River Meenachal: The first third of the river was their friend. Before the Really Deep began. They knew the slippery stone steps (thirteen) before the slimy mud began. They knew the afternoon weed that flowed inwards from the backwaters of the Komarakom. They knew the smaller fish. The flat, foolish pallathi, the silver paral, the wily, whiskered koori, the sometimes karimeen. . . . Here they had studied Silence (like the children of the Fisher People), and learned the bright language of dragonflies. Here they had learned to Wait. To Watch. To think thoughts and not voice them. To move like lightening when the bendy yellow bamboo arced downwards. (193-94)</page><page sequence="14">Vadde 535 The twins' natural education results in markedly different values from Pappachi's and Baby Kochamma's. Where their elders learned to impose their desires onto the nonhuman world, Rahel and Estha learn how to hear that world speak. In a reversal of Kantian subject object dualities, silence becomes a human trait and language the province of the river, dragonflies, and bamboo. Human silence con veys humility in the face of natural forces, and that humility is what permits survival. Rahel and Estha learn to read the bending bamboo as the signal of a storm and to identify the border between the river as friend and the river as "Really Deep." Their literacy is part of a larger acknowledgment of interdependence between the human and nonhuman worlds, one that accords both friendship and deference to a river that enhances human life with enjoyment and livelihood. When Roy refers to the first third of the river as Rahel and Estha's friend, she is not speaking in metaphors; rather, she is introducing social bonds into the environment as a way of linking the human and nonhuman in more egalitarian ways. She suggests that by studying silence, human beings become aware of the landscape as legible, as capable of teaching its inhabitants how to navigate it and to coexist within it despite the radical differences of species. In fact, Roy fos ters cross-species solidarity when she interjects the fate of spiders into narratives of Rahel and Estha's river games. As the twins' newly discovered boat sinks, their hearts sink with it; however, Roy quickly turns the reader's attention from human disappointment to the ship wreck's impact on its nonhuman passengers: "A white boat-spider floated up with the river in the boat, struggled briefly and drowned. Her white egg sac ruptured prematurely, and a hundred baby spiders (too light to drown, too small to swim) stippled the smooth surface of the green water, before being swept out to sea. To Madagascar, to start a new phylum of Malayali Swimming Spiders" (195). The baby spiders' unknown and uncontrolled journey spawned by the twins' own curtailed adventure demonstrates the global ecological ripples of a seemingly local and trivial human endeavor. In bringing these consequences to light, however fantastic, Roy reinserts human be ings into an ecosystem where their actions affect creatures that exist alongside them as beings in their own right. The spiders' migratory fate is not a digression within the central narrative, but integral to shaping the novel's sense of ecological collectivity, taxonomic intru sion (the Malayali spiders do end up as a phylum in Madagascar), and global scope. Unlike Pappachi's entomological pursuits and Baby Kochamma's gardening, Rahel and Estha's river games and the spiders' migration participate in the dynamism and mutability of the backwaters. The twins are not self-enclosed humans, but relational ones; "two egg</page><page sequence="15">536 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy twins" (32) with "a single Siamese soul" (40) who act on the landscape but also allow themselves to be guided by it and each other. When they are the novel's centers of consciousness, Roy uses neologisms like "boatfruit" (193) and "girlboy" (187) to provoke combinatory ways of seeing that reforge the severed links of taxonomic thought. Their joint subjectivities promote an interdependent rather than ascen dant model of the human, and their appreciation of the backwaters' biodiversity ensures their immunity from the "Police Thoughts" that dehumanize people assimilated into institutions of the state. In addition to being an anodyne for state authority, the backwa ters' biodiversity links the maintenance of an ecological collectivity and the survival of an ecosystem to a critique of global capitalism. As Jona than Bate argues, biodiversity depends on the principle of "illusory excess," which states that "species which serve no obvious purpose in one homeostasis may play a vital role in changed environmental circumstances. Their superfluousness is an illusion; they are in fact necessary" (259). Illusory excess aptly describes Roy's literary tech nique that captures biodiversity through an intemperate use of detail. By according the nonhuman elements of the ecosystem an unusual amount of narrative space, Roy rejects anthropomorphic novelistic conventions that would relegate the nonhuman to description and the human to narration. Further, by narrating nonhuman endeavors Roy forces modern human subjectivities to abide by the slow pace of environmental time and reckon with our own ingrained notions of efficiency. Herein, Roy's illusory excess formally antagonizes global capitalist values by decompressing time-space relations to widen the novel's field of vision and stymie quick searches for a bottom line. Her style recalls Roland Barthes's famous identification of details as "scandalous" according to a progressive idea of narrative structure, for they "seem to correspond to a kind of narrative luxury, lavish to the point of offering many 'futile' details and thereby increasing the cost of narrative information" (141).8 Roy's costly details proffer scrutinizing, heterogeneous descriptions of flowers, moss, foliage, and animal behavior in defiance of globalization's homogenizing forces and the Indian state's "Fascist math" ("Greater Common Good" 58), harnessing the backwaters' so-called excess to recalibrate the scale and space of novelistic representation and interpretation. Roy routes human subjectivity through the ecological collectivity of the backwaters to articulate a more ethical vision of political and cultural belonging than the one provided by ascendant humanism and its accompanying ideologies of progress and profit. Her vision is a powerful example of terrestrial cosmopolitanism because it confronts the exclusive conceptual ground of shared humanity with the muddy material ground of shared earth. The "we" of Roy's ecological collec</page><page sequence="16">Vadde 537 tive includes human children and outcasts, arachnids, insects, and plants; their connections arise from Roy's treatment of nonhuman others as subjects whose existences and fates are worthy of narration and whose relations to one another persist through (not in spite of) radical biological differences. Her cosmopolitanism extends past the human in order to capture the global relevance of particular ecologi cal collectivities and bring geographical and indigenous knowledge to bear on political decisions regarding their regulation. Nowhere in Roy's oeuvre is terrestrial cosmopolitanism more evident than in her representation of rivers and riverbanks. In The God of Small Things, the River Meenachal is the backwaters' most powerful resident and the linchpin of its social network wherein non human actors play a vital role in marking human time and recording events that bind communities together. Roy inserts "river-grit" into Vellya Paapen's mortgaged glass eye (190), a symbol of the untouch able's indentured slavery to Mammachi (who paid for the eye) and his felt obligation to disclose Velutha's affair with Ammu to her as a violation of Ayemenem's "Love Laws." Roy further identifies the riverside mangosteen tree, under which the lovers secretly meet and the twins discover their boat, as the same tree that the twins' great grandfather brought home from Mandalay (Burma). This mangosteen tree is a family tree whose body connects ancestors to the present and the twins' adventures to Ammu's. Its introduction into the river bank reminds readers that even undeveloped land has international traces and that human intervention within land need not be violent or garishly superimposed as with Baby Kochamma's garden. In making the river and its surroundings a record keeper for the Ipe family, Roy writes human history as natural history. She captures the intimate bonds that people develop with land, and expresses the need for an environmental literacy that recognizes collective memory, kinship ties, and genealogies within the so-called wilderness. When Rahel returns to Ayemenem after twenty-three years, the Meenachal is thick and toxic with "World Bank pesticides" (14). Its "teeth are drawn, its spirit sent... a slow, sludging green ribbon lawn that ferried fetid garbage to the sea." The river's desecration records the cost of living in an age of transnational corporate devel opment where the Heritage Hotel (a refurbished History House) and Baby Kochamma's satellite dish belie progress. Its waters collect the abject secrets of globalization—plastic bags, dead and deformed fish, "unadulterated factory effluents," and the "dribbling mustard streaks" of impoverished children. In this new era, the History House/Heritage Hotel can "no longer be approached by the river" (119). Developers have fractured the backwaters sphere by building physical boundar ies between the Heritage and the Meenachal; between the "Big God</page><page sequence="17">538 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy howling for obeisance" and the "Small God cauterized and numb to his own temerity" (20). Yet, despite these enclosures, Roy suggests that environmental memory continuously records globalization's violence to rural communities. Rahel's childhood home retains its "river-sense. A rushing, rolling, fishswimming sense" that displaces official narratives of the state and transnational capital (30). Roy's invention of river-sense urges readers to understand the novel's exposition as a manifestation of Rahel and Estha's reacquain tance with Ayemenem's landscape. The twins' ability to reconstruct flashes of past traumas into a coherent and resistant narrative hinges on the disjunctions they witness between Ayemenem in the globalized era and the ecology of their youth. Thus, it is not the timelessness of the landscape, but its interpellation by the flows of global capitalism that catalyzes Roy's tale of exile and return. Even after the developers destroy the backwaters, the ethics of its ecological collectivity persist in the afterlife of a river-sense narrative. River-sense conjoins place, perception, and sensation, capturing the twins' subjectivities and the novel itself as transhuman terrain forged from the continuities of nature's inscriptions and human faculties. Terrestrial Cosmopolitanism in the Transnational Public Sphere Roy has declared the folly of her hyphenated reputation as a "writer-activist"—a writer for her novel and an activist for her essays against nuclear proliferation, dam building, and the privatization of electricity and water provisions (Power Politics 10). The absurdity of dividing Roy's writing from her activism and her fiction from her nonfiction is evident not only from The God of Small Things's thematic indictment of globalization and the Kerala tourism industry, but also from its formal strategies that disturb the anthropocentric hierarchies of value implicit in narrative. These strategies exemplify Roy's fiction writing as a form of activism and they anticipate the rhetorical tech niques of "The Greater Common Good," a polemical essay in which the River Meenachal gives way to the Narmada, an endangered river that stretches through the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat in central India. The Narmada is India's nexus for state/ tribal conflict, interstate conflict, national identity narratives, and globalization critique. Roy wrote "The Greater Common Good" to garner attention and support for the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), a grassroots movement protesting India's construction of the Sardar Sarovar and other megadams and canals throughout the river valley. These dams, marketed as Nehruvian nationalist symbols of India's technological</page><page sequence="18">Vadde 539 prowess, resulted in the displacement of over 33 million people, more than half of whom were Adivasis (tribal people) and Dalits (untouch ables) whose otherness permits their exploitation in the name of the national good (17-18). Reading Roy's essay in conjunction with her novel brings the principles of ecological collectivity to bear on both a particular environmental movement and on broader debates of cosmopolitan citizenship in the transnational public sphere. Where The God of Small Things indirectly reproached collusions between the Indian state and transnational capital, "The Greater Com mon Good" explicitly addresses them. The essay suggests that the Narmada's ecological survival demands terrestrial cosmopolitanism from individuals, that is, the ability to balance the complexities of place with a long-distance understanding of connection, obligation, and solidarity. This difficult task is made more difficult when such features of collectivity are obscured by state secrecy, the international division of labor, and the inaccessibility of the global economy's con trolling institutions. However, Roy responds to the invisible isolation of the dispossessed and the complicity of the privileged by reinserting both parties into modernity's deterministic narratives of progress: "It's very important for me to tell politics like a story, to make it real, to draw a link between a man with his child and what fruit he had in the village he lived in before he was kicked out, and how that relates to Mr. Wolfensohn at the World Bank" ("Interview"). Linking the anonymous to the infamous exacts a power reversal in which those excluded from national citizenship and universal human rights discourses become Roy's principle protagonists. In "The Greater Com mon Good" that protagonist is Bhaiji Bhai, a displaced Adivasi, who has no legal title to his land and lost seventeen of his nineteen acres to the Wonder Canal, one puzzle piece within the megadams network. The essay gathers moral force by pitting Bhaiji Bhai against the Iron Triangle, the trinity of politicians, bureaucrats, and dam construction companies responsible for the development projects that have led to the Narmada's ecological destruction. Roy uses Bhaiji Bhai's story to represent the millions of Adivasis who have become, in Madhav Gadgil and Ramachandra Guha's terms, "ecological refugees" stripped of their homes and livelihoods thanks to the dams' flooding of arable land and endangerment of the freshwater fish populations. Deliberately courting an international audience, Roy oscillates between the localized strategy of explaining the Narmada's ecological deterioration with its individual human tragedies and the more global strategy of appealing to romanticized images of nature.9 Indeed, what is most provocative about Roy's essay is that human protagonists are offset and at times even eclipsed by nonhuman ones, namely the Narmada River. Described as a modern day slave, "legally bound by</page><page sequence="19">540 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy human decree to produce as much water as the government of India commands" (27), the Narmada is a policed body in its own right. It is misshapen by the dams, canals, and irrigation networks, receding from farmland in some places and submerging it in others: "Suddenly they [the displaced residents] can't trust their river anymore. It's like a loved one who has developed symptoms of psychosis. Anyone who has loved a river can tell you that the loss of a river is a terrible, ach ing thing" (50). In moving from "their river" to "a river," Roy uses the affect of human to nature bonds to transform a highly particular case of environmental injustice into an elegy for a lost ideal. The river's so-called psychosis exploits familiar narratives of the natural world's degeneration in the face of increased technology and mechanization. This image of a river in danger further translates the Adivasi experi ence into the more familiar terrain of environmental preservation, allowing Roy to petition the international community via the strategic essentialism of universally recognizable shared symbols. Her blend of fact and sentimentalism, particularity and universality, rallies support for the Narmada's human and nonhuman residents by deploying the river as a variously historical, intimate, and pastoral space and the center of both local and global ecological collectivities. Roy's tactics foster solidarity among English language readers and India's rural and tribal populations who are, in the end, cultural and linguistic strangers. She solicits this solidarity through our mu tual affection for rivers but also, more solemnly, by connecting their sacrifices to our comforts when she asserts that "50 million people have been fed into the development mill and have emerged as air conditioners, and popcorn, and rayon suits" (24). This wording, albeit polemical, is not so different from Andrew Dobson's scholarly pre scription for global ecological citizenship based on a "thickly material account of the ties that bind, created not by mental activity, but by the material production and reproduction of daily life in an unequal and asymmetrically globalizing world" (11). Both ask privileged readers to pay more for our luxuries and to acknowledge that the transforma tions of geographically distant places are inextricably linked to the whims of a larger capitalist world system that benefits few. Political theory and literary text converge in calling for cosmopolitan ecologi cal collectivities that can only begin across alienation and disparity but might end in a fairer distribution of the world's resources and a keener appreciation of natural and human finitude. Roots and Routes While recent revivals of cosmopolitanism have been rigorous in their critiques of Kantian universalism, they have allowed Kant's</page><page sequence="20">Vadde 541 articulation of nature's relationship to human community to fall by the wayside of modern cosmopolites. In theorizing terrestrial cos mopolitanism and ecological collectivity, I have returned to Kant's ideas of man and nature in order to illustrate their legacy in shap ing taxonomic thought. Further, I have argued that certain tensions within those ideas make room for imagining community as a socio cultural (in addition to biological and aesthetic) category. Choosing to acknowledge and learn about the shifting and eclectic relations among species, lands, and bodies of water is crucial to shaping an earthly and worldly cosmopolitanism that ties human welfare to a dynamic view of nature's envelopment and transformation by eco nomic globalization. Although globalization in its current incarnation is more harmful than helpful to the planet's ecological welfare, terrestrial cosmopoli tanism does not vilify all forms of deterritorialized knowledge and practice. Rather, it formulates responses to transnational development by situating ecologies within the extended networks that regulate their resources and livelihoods. As Roy's literary strategies show us, crafting narratives of material global connection contributes to the success of local environmental movements by illuminating the often invisible ties between privileged and sacrificed populations. Universalism and empiricism, as Roy deploys them, are not opposing forces, forever irreconcilable, but constantly negotiated tactics that together yield a cosmopolitan understanding of ecologies and a tempered view of humanity's place within them. Notes I am grateful to Theresa Kelley, Andrew Mahlstedt, Robert Marzec, Rob Nixon, and Susan Stanford Friedman whose generous comments on previous versions of this essay have greatly helped to improve it. My warm thanks also go to Rebecca Walkowitz and the members of the Cosmopolitan Cultures, Cosmopolitan Histories Mellon Workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 1. Recent noteworthy turns toward transnationalizing environmental criticism have returned to the classic space versus place debate to suggest the importance of redefining place in terms of deterritorial ization. Environmentalists have historically valorized the local, but Lawrence Buell argues for the importance of developing "ecodis courses on a planetary scale" (90). Ursula Heise engages this chal lenge by bringing ecocriticism into conversation with risk theory in order to examine the ways that communities reimagine their local and global affiliations when exposed to environmental crises (123). While Buell's and Heise's studies have largely focused on American</page><page sequence="21">542 Ecological Collectivity, Cosmopolitanism, and Arundhati Roy and European literatures, Rob Nixon has discussed the complexities of place in postcolonial Caribbean contexts where place is always already displacement for many inhabitants descended from forced Af rican and Asian migrations (241). Robert Marzec also brings together ecocriticism and transnationalism by developing a theory of British imperialism as a capitalist world system that translated principles of England's enclosure movement into the colonization of foreign lands (3). 2. See, for example, K. Anthony Appiah, whose defense of cosmopoli tanism proceeds on the shared ground of humanity. The human for Appiah is the pragmatic limit of cosmopolitan analysis rather than a problematic within it. The editors of Cosmopolitanism privilege the urban over the rural in their collection, and though suspicious of the historic invocation of the human, stay within its bounds for modern cultural study (7-8). An important exception to the humanist trend in studies of cosmopolitanism is Pheng Cheah, who suggests that the human is not "original or self-originating" but an effect of the forces that condition existence (10). For Cheah, those forces are driven by capitalist globalization; the nonhuman natural world is not really a factor in his analysis. 3. In 2009, the environmental protections enabled by the CRZ are be ing rolled back by the central government itself with the passing of the 2008 Coastal Management Zone (CMZ) notification. CMZ rules have relaxed CRZ measures against beachfront development and abolished many of their No Development Zones (NDZ) at the expense of farming communities and ecological preservation in Kerala and other coastal states. 4. Kant published "Perpetual Peace" five years after completing the third Critique (1790), wherein he developed his theory of nature as containing purposiveness, that is, being for itself rather than being in the service of God. Philippe Huneman offers an excellent essay on how Kant's break with the physico-theological theories of nature continues to shape natural philosophy today. 5. As Harvey points out, there is no published English translation of Physische Geographie, though an English translation of Part I exists as a master's thesis by Ronald Bolin. There is a French translation that was issued in 1999 (531). 6. See Natalie Mêlas for an astute theory of comparison in the absence of equivalence. Rather than inventing an imaginary ground of equiva lence for comparison, she acknowledges the incommensurability of objects of study and develops an approach to reading that preserves disparity and heterogeneity through the comparative process. 7. Although Roy uses a fictional name—Ayemenem—for the village in which she grew up, she keeps the name of the river Meenachal that flows through it. The Meenachal originates in the Western Ghats and flows into the Vembanad Lake. Vembanad is Kerala's largest and India's longest lake; its wetlands feature (among other forms of biodiversity) the Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary.</page><page sequence="22">Vadde 543 8. This interpretation departs from that of Graham Huggan who has claimed that Roy's lush descriptions of the backwaters uphold Ori entalist conceptions of India by marketing exoticism (see The Post colonial Exotic). While Huggan has elsewhere recognized valuable contributions to environmental literature in Roy's nonfiction (see "Greening Postcolonialism"), he does not find the same potential in her fictional strategies. 9. "The Greater Common Good" was first published simultaneously in the Indian national magazines Outlook and Frontline in June 1999. Within a month, it was coupled with Roy's antinuclear proliferation essay "The End of Imagination" and marketed to international English speaking audiences under the title The Cost of Living.
