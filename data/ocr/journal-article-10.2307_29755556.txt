<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marie-Therese Barreled Figurines et reliefs en terre cuite de la Mesopotamie Antique - I - Potiers, termes de metier, procedes de fabri? cation et production (Institut Francais d'Ar cheologie de Beyrouth - Bibliotheque Archeolo gique et Historique, 85) (Paris, Librairie Orientaliste Paul Geuthner, 1968, 540 pp., 88 tables, 94 illustrations in text). This is the first volume of a work belonging to the genre that the French call de longue haleine. It may be said at once that it is one of those ? all too rare ? works that give more than their title promises. It will be welcomed with interest not only by the professional archaeologist, in the instance of the Mesopotamian area, but by many other experts ranging from the historian and technologist of ceramics, and the student of comparative iconography of the ancient Orient, to the researcher in the field of Oriental religions, as well as those working in that unlimited field which, by common agreement, is called ? Assyri ology?, but which in fact includes many other civilizations and cultures that flourished in ancient Mesopotamia up till the Seleucid and Parthian period. This ?Mesopotamia? ? the Author informs us ? is ?composed of very different regions and diverse ethnic groups, which fluc? tuated over the centuries and who expressed themselves in cultures as varied as their multifari? ous relations with surrounding countries, which were not, in ancient times, restricted by rigid political frontiers ?. Confronted with such variety ? the sign of a vibrant vitality ? the Author seeks a point of view and of reference that will allow her to perceive an element that has remained constant, or relatively stable, through the thousands of years: she believes that she can identify it not only in earthenware, that is to say in the art and handicraft of the potter, but actually in a sort of cosmological and religious Weltanschauung, based, in this area, on the given material of this technique and art: fired clay. In fact, clay is the real protagonist of this monograph. Clay or, to be more precise, terre ? potier, that clayey and calcareous earth which 389</page><page sequence="2">is easily mouldable and which has been part of the cultural history of Mesopotamian humanity from the times of the most remote proto-agricul tural civilizations, originating in the Neolithic age, providing them with a primary material not only for objects of basic necessity (bricks, receptacles, writing tablets, etc.), but also for their increasingly refined artistic creations. The most ancient of these works of art which owe their existence to clay and the artists who knew how to mould it, form the essential matter of the present work; but ? as has been said ? with this material base as a starting point, the Author's insight tends to dominate an increasingly wide field of vision, so that we are given an impressive survey of some of the most important aspects of the material, artistic and religious culture of ancient Mesopot? amia. In spite of the central role of clay in Mesopota? mia's culture, both material and spiritual, the archaeological sources available at present seem strangely meagre in the information they provide on the technical aspect of the work of the potter and ceramist in the Tigris and Euphrates valley. In fact, as the Author points out, archaeological excavations, which have now been going on for decades on innumerable sites, have so far revealed neither workshops, installations or tools that might throw light on the technical procedures employed by the potter. Unlike ancient Egypt, whose illustrated documents keep us meticulously informed on this aspect of craftsmanship, as well as on so many others, in Mesopotamian icon? ography there are no representations of manual work: thus one must turn to written sources in order to glean possible information on the sub? ject. This is what the Author has done, and she succeeds in obtaining valuable results, which are expounded in the first chapter of her monograph entitled: Potiers, termes de metiers et procedes de fabrication. Her task was made more difficult by the absence of authentic technical treatises, dedicated to craftsmanship, in Sumerian or Akkad? ian language. Nevertheless, the most disparate texts provide, sometimes incidentally, the elements of a specialised technical vocabulary as well as certain schematic recipes or instructions, referring, it is true, only to the work of the metallurgist, or of the enamel worker, etc., but which permit us to glimpse highly evolved techniques and procedures of great antiquity. But nothing of the sort has so far come to light as regards the clay worker. At this point, extremely significant evidence presented itself to the Author: the references to clay workmanship, which are by no means totally absent, are not found at all in the literature mentioned above, which could be defined ? technol ogical?, but such references ?come from the higher areas of the cultural tradition ?, to quote the Author's words. This information comes, in fact, primarily from religious and mythological texts, in which we find none less than the gods themselves in the role of moulders of clay. It seems that the convincing documentation assembled by the Author enables us to rule out the possibil? ity that clay work was considered, at least in this remote mythopoeic phase of Mesopotamian existence, by the same standard as other ? profane ? crafts, dedicated to the transformation of other ? prime materials ?. Rather, everything seems to indicate that the handling of clay was invested with a particular significance: sacred, ? numinous ?. A sub-chapter, of considerable historical and religious interest, is dedicated to the dieux potiers. The Author also provides an apposite synoptic table, indicating the chief sources ? his? torical, mythological, poetical, epic, ritual, cosmol ogical ? in which there is mention of gods working in clay. We find a large section of the Sumerian-Akkadian pantheon in this table: the divine moulders of clay, painstakingly giving form to the first man, or to monstruous beings, or to other gods, kings and men. As might be expect? ed, the Sumerian Enki, ? Lord of the earth ? (as well as of the subterranean waters and of wisdom) ?who creates and gives birth?, is particularly active in this field, which we could almost call rof his competence5, and in fact we find him in the synoptic table ? as well as in the well documented text which accompanies and illustrates it ? asking the great goddess Nammu, his mother, to form the first men out of clay, imparting detailed ? technological? instructions on the matter. In another mythical poem, we meet the chief god of the Sumerian pantheon, Enlil, in his role as ?creator of the pick-axe ?, in other words, of the tool essential for extracting clay from the earth. It seems, moreover, that the same passage indicates that Enlil is also the creator of the mould which serves to shape the anthropo? morphic figures. Also in some versions of the famous Gilgamesh cycle we find the modelling of an anthropomorphic figure which is granted life by the gods. But the gods, who mould both men and bricks, do not consider it beneath their dignity even to knead clay in order to make recipients out of it: one text contains a precise allusion to a god-potter (hah?r/paharu). Ea ? the Akkadian equivalent of the Sumerian Enki ? besides being the master of magic, is above all the patron of potters (sa pahari). The female divinities are closely connected with clay work. ? Patron of the potter ? is one of the epithets of Belet-ile, the queen of the gods. The word paharu, potter, or rather, moulder of clay, accord 390</page><page sequence="3">ing to the researches of authoritative Sumerologists such as B. Landsberger and S. N. Kramer, goes back to a pre-Sumerian stratum, a stage to which other names designating handicrafts also belong: proof of the considerable artisan specialisation that already existed in the prehistoric population. According to Landsberger, this specialisation would already have received its above-mentioned name before the arrival of the Sumerians, that is to say before the end of the al-cUbaid Period. A. Ungnad, on the other hand, believes that almost all the names designating trades and handicrafts, including the name for the potter, are of Sumerian origin. Whatever the origins of the word under discussion, it is hardly necessary to point out that pottery appeared some thousands of years before the immigration of the Sumerians. Leaving out of consideration the Neolithic of Jarmo in its preceramic and ceramic stages (according to R. J. Braidwood, of the 7th millenium), with its more ancient modellings in unbaked clay, one only has to recall the great ceramic cultures of the Chalcol? ithic: the culture of Hass?na-S?marr?, flourishing around 5000, the painted and polychrome ware of Tell Halaf (around 4500 B.C.) and so on. From then on the decoration of this pottery shows symbolical and religious contents, which even in this prehistoric phase convey a sacred character to the art of the potter, a characteristic it keeps ? as the Author proves irrefutably by her doc? umentation ? throughout the successive proto historic and historic periods of Mesopotamian pottery. In exploring the unearthed material, epigraph ically and archaeologically relevant to the evolution of ceramics (and the ceramist's role) in the Mesopotamian area, the Author concentrates on the following periods: the Early Dynastic Period, the dynasties of Ur I-III and Lagash (Gudea), up to the first Babylon Dynasty, to Hammurabi and his Code of Law, to the documents brought to light in the palace of Mari, up to the neo Babylonian era, and beyond. The ? cue ? which guides the Author through this labyrinth, is always the potter's name, paharu, whatever the origin and etymology of this word. But this first chapter is not confined to philological considerations: besides providing us with precise information on many other technical terms relating to the metier of the Mesopotamian potter, it also shows him at work, specifying and illustrating the various processes of manufacture, and comparing them with analogous ceramist's techniques and handling in other places of the world and at other times, including Eastern countries today. As always, the text is illustrated and enlivened by numerous well-chosen photographs. We think that this section of the excellent book will hold particular interest for the student of the history of ceramics and technical procedures used in ancient times. Worthy of attention from the ethno-sociological point of view are some comparative details quoted by the Author (who cites on this point, besides other ethnologists, the unusual ideas of R. Briffault, 1927: ?Vart de la poterie est une invention feminine ?) in support of the hypothesis that, in archaic clay work in Mesopotamia, women played the most prominent part, as still today in Syria. (By the way, Briffault's ?feministic? ideas seem less unusual when compared with those of Gordon Childe (What Happened in History, 1951, p. 59): ?All ... inventions and discoveries were, judged by ethnographic evidence, the work of the women. To that sex, too, may by the same token be credited the chemistry of pot-making, the physics of spinning, the mechanics of the loom, and the botany of flax and cotton ...?). The second chapter, entitled: La production ?? son developpement historique, deals mainly with history of art. It attempts to trace the development of plastic art in clay: small figures and reliefs in terracotta, 'receptacles, plastic decora? tions, bricks and enamelled facings, etc. The use of enamel ? which had made its first appearance in the latter half of the 2nd millennium ? becomes current practice in the neo-Assyrian and neo-BabyIonian periods. This section of the book contains, inter alia, a valuable contribution to the discussion of a much debated problem: was the idea of forming small reliefs in terracotta with the help of a mould ? a method practised in Mesopotamia from after the end of the 3rd millennium ? adopted by the Aegean world, or did it at least exercise a decisive influence on the development of a similar technique in the Aegean area at the beginning of the 1st millennium? Drawing conclusions from the researches of other authoritative specialists, the Author puts forward the view that the process of estampage de Vargile reached Greece from Mesopotamia, presumably by way of Syria: the ? international? importance, from this point of view, of the port of al-Mina, in northern Syria, especially in the first half of the 8th centuiry, is well known, and the even more ancient Phoenician mediation for these, as for other cultural and artistic elements, origina? ting in Mesopotamia and Asia Minor in general, still remains plausible. As may be inferred from this particular ? to which further details could be added, if space permitted ? the influence of the ceramic tech? niques evolved in Mesopotamia on that of other areas of the ancient East and, indirectly, on the incipient Western culture, is beyond doubt. It is from these anthropomorphic and zoomorphic 391</page><page sequence="4">figurines, part of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures between the two rivers ? cultures charged with a half magical, half religious ? numinosity ? ? that an invisible thread of spiritual commu? nication brings us, through Thessalian, Helladic, Cycladic and Minoan civilisations, to ancient Greece, which too was still wrapped in an aura of sacredness and magic. In this phantasmagoric procession of the centuries one element seems to escape the flight of time and the transience of things and ideas: the figure of the Mother-Goddess, of the Deesse-mere, venerated by all the peoples of the Near East since Neolithic times. ?Ich sehe dich in tausend Bildern ? ? thus one of the most sublime poets of the ? western ? world, Novalis, addressed this eternal human ? archetype ?, which renews itself continually in ? a thousand images ?, names and epithets, among which the image passionately invoked by the poet under the name of ? Maria ? is only one of thousands. In Madame Barrelet's book, at whatever table we open the abundant illustrated section, we find ourselves in the presence of this Ewig Weiblichen, in her appearances as mother, priestess, hierodule, lover. Not only are there innumerable female figures in their divine nakedness, but the Author is also anxious to clarify all the technical details of these plastic creations, their chronology, periodization and typology. No student of the ancient East should neglect the numerous pages of this book, on which the Author, with the most scrupulous specialist akribeia, has laboured to give us a phenomenology and typology of these often moving figurative expressions of the most archaic agrarian and cultural communities of the Tigris and Euphrates valley. Needless to say, besides the evidence of the ancient Mesopotamian Goddess cult, the innumerable male and animal figurines, the -reliefs and plastic ornament are also examined and placed in a just light and accurately dated ? as far as possible ? with just as much care. Though not concealing the difficulties that must be faced by anyone wishing to establish precise relations between these terracottas, etc. on the one hand, and the events and stages of the pragmatic history of the corresponding area on the other, the Author does not hesitate to attempt a diachronical panorama which allows the attribution of the material in hand to the following eight basic groups: 1 - From the 5th millennium to the Akkad Dynasty; 2 - the era of the Akkad Dynasty; 3 - era of the 3rd Ur Dynasty; 4 - era of Isin and Larsa; 5 - from Hammurabi to the end of the 1st Babylonian Dynasty; 6 - the 2nd half of the 2nd millennium; 7 - from the beginning of the 1st millennium to 539; 8 - from 539 up to 224 A. D. We may call to the reader's mind that the Author uses the Sumerian-Akkadian name of the potter, haharj paharu as a ? guide ? through some of these stages ? namely, those for which written evidence exists. Thus we come to the third ? and last ? chapter of the book, a chapter which, even more than the two preceding ones, is impossible to summarise exhaustively. It is, in fact, almost exclusively descriptive, as could already be deduced from its title: La production', description, themes iconographiques, d'apres une collection de terres cuites appurtenant au musee du Louvre. We have here then a kind of scientific guide through the rich collection of Mesopotamian terracottas in the Louvre museum, accumulated by various French archaeological missions for almost a century. The chief localities explored, some with great success, are: Tello, Sinkara-Larsa, Kis, Tell Hariri-Mari, Khorsabad-Dur Sarrukin. Other terracottas, de? scribed in this kind of catalogue, derive from gifts and acquisitions in the antique market. An iconographic inventory of the objects reproduced, a chronological index (of gods, per? sonal names, geographical localities), a list of the techniques employed in the shaping and moulding of clay, of the relative technical terms, etc., add to the value and practical utility of this important and highly commendable scientific publication.
