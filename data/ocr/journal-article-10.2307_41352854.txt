<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ibn Tümart and the Almoravids: 'The Evil Deeds of the mujassimiin from Kãkudam', Selected Passages from Ibn Tümart' s Acazz mã yutlab H.T. Norris School of Oriental and African Studies Introduction Ibn Tümart's Acazz mã yutlab (The Dearest of All Desires') has been viewed as a major political and religious manifesto aimed at his Almoravid opponents. While this is true, it is also more than this, since it displays the theological and ontological gap between the unitarian Almohad Mahdl and his strict, if multi-ethnic, Mâlikî Saharan opponents. It underlines the gulf that existed between the religious values of the 'desert' and the 'south' within Morocco and within the Western Sahara which lay to its south. It also displays the gulf between 'fundamentalism' and 'literalism' within the Islamic thought of the age. According to Michael Brett and Werner Foreman, in their The Moors , Islam in the West , 'After years spent in the Muslim East, Ibn Tümart had returned to the Maghrib. Having denounced the immorality of Tunis, attacked Saharan ladies as they rode barefaced through the capital of Morocco, and disputed the attributes of God with the scholars of the Almoravid court, he was forced to flee for his life to his birthplace in the hills. Among his own people, the Berbers of the High Atlas, his message became personal.'1 The following is a translation of selected passages from the Acazz mã yutlab. The Arabic text has already been published by Goldziher, in an edition dating to 1903, 2 and the excerpts presented here are related to a larger project of translations of Saharan texts I am undertaking, to be published in the future. This highly subjective and neglected document by Ibn Tümart, whose birth dates vary between 471/1078 and 473/1081, is a unique document from the age of decadence of the Almoravids. He was Journal of Qur'anic Studies 13.2 (2011): 155-164 Edinburgh University Press DOI: 10.3366/jqs.20 11.0027 © Centre of Islamic Studies, SOAS www.eupjournals.com/jqs</page><page sequence="2">156 Journal of Qur'anic Studies from the Masmüda branch of the Berbers and his opponents were nomadic Berber Sanhäja. He lived in an age when opponents attempted to outwit one another in their Qur'anic knowledge and learning in Islamic Studies; Ibn Tumart also studied hadlth and Mãlikl fiqh ; and his work has the flavour of shu'ubiyya as well as religious dialectic. As I wrote in The Berbers in Arabic Literature , 'to Muhammad ibn Tumart the Almoravids were corporealists and anthropomorphists ( mujassimun ), to whom the vision of the divine was material and literal to the point of idolatry. Allah's throne was as tangible and material and literal as their eroded Saharan rocks which they believed had been shaped into high places and gardens for the jinn .'3 Translation [p. 258] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful. A chapter that will set out [the identity of] the parties of the falsifiers from the people of the veil and the corporealists , together with their identifying characteristics ( calãmãtihim ). All such signs and characteristics are visibly manifest [that is, clearly to be seen]. Among them are those which were manifest before they came forth from Kãkudam,4 and those, likewise, that became apparent after their occupation of the country took place, together with those that were to come about from their circumstances (( ahwãlihim ) and actions (af alihim). Those characteristics [or signs] which were apparent before they came forth [from Kãkudam] were five in number: the first of them is that they were barefoot (al-hufa)', the second that they are scantily clad (« al-carã ); third, that they live at the expense of others [namely, they were in a community where there were dependants (i.e. slaves, families of related clans and groups)] (al-cãlã)' fourth, that they are herders of wild sheep and cows (ricãJ al-shã ' wďl-bahní)' 5 fifth that they are ignorant of God's [authority and] commands. Those signs or characteristics which appeared after they had seized the land are seven in number: first, their appearance is a sign of the End of Time; second, they are 'kings'; third, they bear their heads high within [tall] buildings; fourth, they give birth by slave women and take numerous concubines; fifth, they are deaf (summ); and sixth, they are dumb ( bukm ) - in the sense that they are deaf to the Truth and they do not pay heed to it, they are dumb to the Truth and neither ascribe to it nor command it. All of the above stem from their ignorance and their departure [in error] from the Truth. Seventh, they are wholly untrustworthy people, and not fit for undertaking the command and the rule in God's name (ma hum ahlan li'1-amãna wa'1-qiyãm bi-amr Allah).</page><page sequence="3">Ibn Tumart and the Almoravids 157 [p. 259] Those signs which appeared later and which emerged from their circumstances and their deeds were eight in number. The first of these was that they hold in their hands whips like the knotted tails of cattle;6 the second that they persecute people, and flog them with these whips; the third is that the hair on the heads of their womenfolk resembles the humps of Bactrian camels - that is to say, that they gather their plaits above their heads [so that they are firmly fixed on top of their heads] in that style and fashion; the fourth is that their womenfolk are naked in their attire; the fifth is that they err from the Truth (mãJilãt yacni can al-haqq ), and from true guidance; the sixth is that they stray and cause others to stray and be tempted by other women; the seventh is that they come and go forth in the morning resentful; and the eighth is that they depart, at a later hour, with a curse and with condemnation. These are the signs, which total 20 in number; the Messenger of God reported all of them before they came to pass. All of these signs became manifest, in accordance with his predictions, and amongst them are those found in a hadlth of cUmar b. al-Khattãb and in the ahãdlth that were reported by Abü Hurayra. We shall cite wherever there is a specific statement to this effect, so that knowledge might be gleaned from it. So, on the authority of cUmar b. al-Khattãb: Verily, the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, was visited by Gabriel, who said to him, 'O Messenger of God, tell me about the Hour of Doomsday?' Muhammad said, 'He who is questioned about it has no more knowledge of it than the one who poses the question.' Gabriel asked, Tell me then about its [signs and tokens and] forewarnings.' Muhammad replied, 'When the slave girl begets her master / mistress, when you see the unshod (&lt; al-hufãt ), the naked (al- curãt), those families which marry between social classes (al- cãlãt), the shepherds of ewes, the other herders, and those who go to excess in their begetting and in their building.' Then Gabriel departed and the Prophet tarried awhile, then said, 'O cUmar, didst thou know who the questioner was?' I said, 'God and His Messenger are the best informed.' He said, 'Verily, it was Gabriel, he came to you to teach you your religion [Islam].' On the authority of Abü Hurayra: The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, was visited by Gabriel, who said 'O Messenger of God when will the Hour of Doomsday take place?' Muhammad said, 'He who is questioned about it has no better knowledge of it than the one who asks, but I shall tell you about its conditions: when the slave girl begets her master, that is one of the conditions, and when the barefoot and the naked are leaders of the people, that is another of its conditions, likewise, when those who are shepherds of [black] sheep vye with one another in the building of [lofty] mansions [p. 260]. 7 These signs are amongst the five conditions that are known to God, alone.' Then the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, recited, knowledge of the Hour [of Resurrection ] belongs to God</page><page sequence="4">158 Journal of Qur'anic Studies alone ... [Q. 31:34]. 8 Also, on the authority of Abu Hurayra: Gabriel questioned the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, and said, 'O Messenger of God, when will the Hour be established?' Muhammad replied, 'He who is asked knows no more than he who asks. I shall try to tell you about its conditions. When the slave girl gives birth to her master, this is to be found amongst its portents. When you behold that the barefoot, the naked, and the deaf and dumb (al-summ wa'l-bukm) are kings of the earth, this is one of its portents. When you behold the shepherds of [black] sheep vying with one another in the building of [lofty] mansions, this is one of its portents. There are five portents which are only known to God.' Then he recited the verse, Knowledge of the Hour [of Resurrection] belongs to God alone ; it is He who sends down the relieving rain ... [Q. 31:34]. To quote Abu Hurayra again: A bedouin Arab asked the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, about the Hour. The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'When the trust has been lost {di' at al-amãna) then expect the Hour's arrival.' [The Bedouin] asked 'How will it be lost?' He replied, 'When the command (« al-amr ) has been ascribed to those to whom it does not rightfully belong ( ilã ghayr ahlihi ), then expect the Hour.' A chapter in regard to their characteristics and signs The Prophet, peace be upon him, pledged for them [that they would suffer in] Hellfire, [feeling the pain of God's] wrath, anger and curse. To cite [further], Abu Hurayra said: The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'There are two kinds of people who inhabit Hell, neither of whom I have beheld; a people who possess whips and lashes like the tails of cattle wherewith they beat [and flog] the people and [secondly] women who are clad in scanty attire, semi-naked, the crowns of their heads [adorned in hair that is piled up] in the shape of [the humps of] Bactrian camels.9 Such persons will not enter Paradise, nor will they inhale its fragrant scent, indeed, its air and scent are far removed and far distant from such people.' On the authority of Abü Hurayra: I heard the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, utter the words that, 'A long journey would be required for you to arrive at the place where you would see a people who go forth in wrath, [ill tempered], in the morning, and who depart with a curse upon their lips, and who bear in their hands whips in the form of cattle tails. Such are peculiarly theirs and are possessed by none besides them.' [p. 261 ] A chapter about the abominations that they perpetrated and the grave losses that they inflicted, their lives spent in ill-gotten gains , their eating and their drinking of that which is unlawful, their coming and going, their sensual embodiment of belief [bombast, and pride and excess] (tajsïm) and their gross infidelity.</page><page sequence="5">Ibn Tumart and the Almoravids 159 There is but one kind [of category for those who comit such abominations, i.e. the mujassimün]. Due to the infamy and ill repute [of this behaviour] it requires no further clarification or detailed description. Suffice to say that their corporeal and excessive behaviour, their infidelity, their falsehood, their needfulness, needs no proof nor physical evidence. No elaboration, therefore, is required or will be forthcoming. It has been recorded on the authority of Kacb b. cUjra that the Messenger of God, the blessing and peace of God be upon him, said to him, 'O Kacb [with regards to], someone living off ill-gotten gains, is any action, other than his being cast into the fire of Hell, a fitting punishment?' A chapter on the prohibition of collaboration with the mujassimün in their evildoing or believing in their lies On the authority of Ibn cUjra: The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'Seek the help of God, O Kacb b. cUjra, from the princes who will come after me, and from him who approaches their gates, believes their lies and gives assistance to them in their oppression. He is not one of mine, nor am I one of his, and he will never be returned to me at the sacred pool ( al-hawd)}0 However, he who does not approach their gates, who disagrees with their lying falsehoods, and who does not assist them in their oppression, then he is one of mine, and I am one of his, and he will be returned to me at the sacred pool.' In regard to this hadith , it is [shown that] he who makes himself an enemy of these people and who perseveres in following the Sunna of the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, and his religion, then the sacred pool will await him, if God so wills it. He who abandons his faith, and who returns to them, who changes and alters, who believes in their falsehoods and aids them in their oppression [and evildoing] will be driven away from the sacred pool and he will never come to it. Among the hadith of Abü Hurayra there is a clarification of this, on the authority of Abu Hurayra [himself]: Verily, the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'I wish that I had seen [and beheld] our brethren.' They said 'Are we not your brethren?' He said 'Nay, rather you are my Companions, and our brethren are those who have not yet come. I am the one who will lead them to the sacred pool.' In this is a warning for 'the party of the people of the Truth' who are resolute in their faith [p. 262] after the Prophet's death, and who have clung fast to his Sunna. There is also a warning to be found therein for 'the parties of the people of falsehood' ( tawďifahl al-bãtil ) who have forsaken their religion after his death, those who have apostasised and who have changed and altered, who have corporealised their faith (jassamü ), and who have opposed the truth. The Prophet said, 'Indeed men will be lost to (yudhãdna can) my sacred pool, just as the camel who wanders (dhãda) is lost. I will cry out to them, "Come ye, come ye, indeed, come forward!" Then it will</page><page sequence="6">160 Journal of Qur'anic Studies be said "They changed [the religion] after you." and I will say, "Be crushed and perish, perish, perish!'" A chapter on recognising the followers [ of the mujassimun ], who aided and abetted them in their wrongdoing, and who believed in their lies and a clarification of their deeds [subdivided] into three categories Amongst [the mujassimün ] are the mulabissün' that is to say, the tricksters [or cunning deceivers] who led [their followers] astray without knowledge, and who entreat through their legal judgements in favour of their gross falsehoods and their whims and fancies. Whenever they are asked about something they issue a judgement on it, in accordance with their whims and their aims. Hence they have strayed and have misled others. And a clarification of this quality [of their nature] and character, is to be found in the hadïth of cAbd Allah b. cAmr b. al-cÃs, who said: I heard the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, say that 'God does not take knowledge away by wresting it from the people, rather He takes away knowledge by taking hold of the scholar until a point is eventually reached where none remain. The people then choose and select their chiefs, who are men of ignorance, and when they are asked and questioned they issue edicts (fatãwã) without sufficient knowledge. They are misled, hence they, in turn, mislead!' This was reported by Muslim and al-Bukhãri. All of this is evident and perceivable, no clarification is required, and in the midst of those people there are helpers and supporters who are apostates who have returned to them, who have sold their faith for worldly gain. Among them are those who, in the morning are believers, but by evening time have become infidels, selling their faith. All of this is apparent ( zãhir ), and there is no necessity for a long discussion. Clarification ( bayãn ) of it is to be found in the following hadïth from Abü Hurayra: Verily the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'Hasten to complete your affairs before the strife of darkness ( bãdirã bil-acmãl fitanan ka-qiťVl-layl al-muzlim) for man goes forth at daybreak as a believer and by evening he is an infidel, or he believes in the evening and at daybreak he is an infidel, selling his faith for worldly gain. The trial and temptation of faith (fitnat al-dln) is greater than these temptations and there is no trial that is greater than apostasy (al-irtidãd) [p. 263] and to alter and change [in religion]. Amongst their helpers are the 'slaves of the dinar and the dirham' and the 'Blackshirts' ( al-khamisa or 'the empty bellied' khamls al-batn ), who are beneath their authority in humiliation, in degradation and in baseness. They have forsaken their religion and their ultimate future, seeking [instead] their satisfaction, out of fear for this world and their prohibited happiness unattained, and their fleeting world that was not to last for them. They have forfeited both this world and the next world. [Such are] the men who are accursed by the tongue of the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him.</page><page sequence="7">Ibn Tumart and the Almoravids 161 On the authority of Abü Hurayra: The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'Let the slave of the dinar be accursed, accursed be the slave of the dirham.' Likewise, the Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'Wretched be the slave of the dinar and the slave of the dirham and the blackshirted slave, if he is given [worldly riches] he is content but if he is not then he is resentful.' On the authority of Abu Hurayra: The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, said, 'There are three peoples whom God will not address on the Day of Resurrection. He will not set eyes upon them and He will not honour them. Theirs will be a painful punishment.' And Abü Hurayra narrated the hadlth of the Prophet: A man swears allegiance to a leader, doing so only for worldly gain. Though he should give him some of it, and even if he does not give him any of it, [his allegiance] in no way has been fulfilled. Their habit and their custom is that they incline towards worldly things. One constantly observes a self-centred state of affairs [and attitude] among them. When they demonstrate an inclination to participate [in something], and they undertake to participate [in it], they only oblige by doing so where it suits their wishes, and this is closely associated with their worldly tendencies. Such then is the attitude and position that they demonstrate: [worldly ways and goals govern their participation]. A chapter on the obligation to oppose the corporealists, and on the necessity to prohibit any following or imitation of them , or demonstration of any affection to them. The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, commanded an opposition to [and a separation from] the people of falsehood in what they wore, the deeds they performed and in all of their affairs. He did this in many of his statements. He said, 'Oppose the Jews, oppose the polytheists, the Zoroastrians, and also the corporealists (. al-mujassimün ) who are among the infidels. They wear women's attire in that they cover their faces with a veil ( al-lithãm wa'1-niqãb ), and their womenfolk resemble their menfolk in uncovering themselves, their faces unveiled, not wearing any head covering whatsoever (&lt; al-riqãb ). Resemblance to the male gender is prohibited, according to what Ibn cAbbãs narrated on the authority of the Prophet, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him. [p. 264] He said: 'The Messenger of God, may the blessings and peace of God be upon him, cursed the mutashãbihun : women who dress like men and men who dress like women. The curse is applicable to all. All of that is forbidden and is unlawful'.

Norris, The Arab Conquest of the Western Sahara (Harlow: Longman, 1986), pp. 158-63. 3 H.T. Norris, The Berbers in Arabic Literature (London and New York: Longman and Libraire du Liban, 1982). 4 Kãkudam (variant Qüqüdam, Kawkadam, Kãkdam). Cf al-ldrisl in N. Levtzion (tr. and ed.) and J.F.P. Hopkins (ed.), Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), p. 128. Only Ibn Tumart and Ibn Khaldun imply that a very extensive part of the Sahara was intended, namely the entire territory of the mulththamün , the 'veiled peoples' (today we know them as the Tuareg, the Moors of Mauritania and other mixed ethnic Saharan population). Among Arab geographers and historians in general the name is variously attached to (i) a location, (ii) a specific town, principally AzuggT (Azuqi) in Mauritania, (iii) a centre for the manufacture of the lamtl ('oryx-skin') shields, (iv) a waterless tract on a caravan route devoid of population, (v) a narrow passage for trans-Saharan caravans, and (vi), in two instances, a name of a tribe. It is possible that both tribe and town were once connected. No town in the Sahara of today has a name that recalls Kãkudam, with the sole exception of Agadem in South Eastern Niger (see Francis Rennell Rodd, People of the Veil (London: n.p., 1926), pp. 333^4-). This town is too remote from the heartland of the Almoravids to be of any relevance. It is almost certain that the name was a common widespread toponym in the Sahara. It could have a relevance to three Tuareg terms that are found today: (a) dgidi / igedan : iguda ('dune du sable vivant'), or (b) dgddm ('entourer de tous côtés ou d'un seul côte/é; au bord d'une valée / mare / fleuve'), or (c) could (b) above have any connection with the fable that the first ribãt of the Almoravids was located within an 'island' surrounded by water? ( agadam / igadaman / dgdem ('passage'); asddom / isdgdam ('lieu de passage, qué'). One cannot exclude some relationship between North African (particularly Libyan) place names and the Arab and Berber groups in the Arabic accounts, whether such are mentioned by geographers or by historians, with their sundry borrowed nomenclature from Classical sources. It has long been proposed that the Igdalen Tuareg, and the Almoravid Gudãla may have had some connection with the Classical Getullu and Gaetuli of Corripus and Pliny, and the Ifoghãs (and the Banü Ifüran of Ibn Khaldun) with the Classical Iforas.</page><page sequence="9">Ibn Tumart and the Almoravids 163 The same circumstances may have equally applied to the choice of the name of 'Kãkudam' that was first employed by Ibn Tumart. In the latter case it would be linked to the Ogdaemae, who were placed by Ptolemy close to Mount Ogdaemum, not far west of Lake Moeris in the Western Desert of Egypt (see Oric Bates, The Eastern Libyans: An Essay (London: Frank Cass and Co. Ltd, 1970), pp. 60-1, and especially Map Vili (Ethno-Geography of Eastern Libya from Ptolemy's positions), and Francis Rennell Rodd, The People of the Veil (London: Macmillan, 1926, pp. 322-5). Continuous migrations of Libyan tribes (and, in particular, under Hilãll pressure) from East to West, and over many centuries, could explain much of the often confused and incoherent tribal picture which is afforded within the Arab geographers' lists of tribes and their locations throughout the entire Maghrib. In order to assess the 'island ribãf story, see Levtzion and Hopkins, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources, pp. 239-40, in the much criticized account of Ibn Abl Zarc of Fez (d. 715/1315). For the terminology cited above, see Ghubayd agg-Alawjeli, Awgalel Tdmajdq Tdfrensist Ghoubeïd Alojaly, Lexique , (Copenhagen: n.p., 1980), p. 49, p. 50. In connection with the latter terms, see al-Bakri's ' Wanzamlrì in Levtzion and Hopkins, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources , p. 67, which may be contrasted with al-Idrïsï's disputed identification with AzüggT / Azüqi / Azukkï in Mauritania on p. 28. 5 This reference to 'wild sheep' possibly 'black sheep', which at the time were more common in the Southern than the Northern Sahara, clearly indicates that Ibn Tümart viewed their presence as reprehensible. Since, at that time, 'black sheep' were less to be found in the north it would seem that the northern migration of the Saharan Almoravids, accompanied by 'black sheep', was a baleful fact to be faced by the Moroccan Berbers. See, T. Lewicki, West African Food in the Middle Ages according to Arabic Sourcs (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974). The sheep which Ibn Tümart found offensive were in al likelihood al-kibãsh al-damanïya (Ovis longipes). They had no fleece and had a long, thick tail. It certainly warranted a special mention by him. All the unfavourable aspects of the Almoravids in the eyes of Ibn Tumart were expressed in the term tajslm , which, as has been shown by Alfred Bel, indicated anthropomorphism. In the eyes of Ibn Tümart it was carried to an extreme so as to be a causus belli. In his view there was no distinction to be made between anthropomorphism and infidelity. The anthropomorphists equalled the Christians in such infidelity. 6 These flagellants' whips are frequently depicted in medieval maps, for example the Catalan Map of Charles V (1375 AD). See the frontispiece that depicts Mansa Müsä, 'Lord of the Negroes of Guinea', published in E.W. Bovili, Caravans of the Old Sahara: An Introduction to the History of the Western Sudan (London: Oxford University Press, 1933). For details in regard to the imposition of punishments by flogging that were imposed on the Almoravids by °Abd Allah b. Yãsln, see Levtzion and Hopkins, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources , pp. 74-5. 7 It is curious that Ibn Tümart' s criticism of the Almoravids for their taste in high building, and their class distinction and arrogance, was preceded by a very similar view that was expressed and held by cAbd Allãh b. Yãsln, the sprititual leader of the Almoravids within the Sahara itself. According to al-Bakri this question convinced cAbd Allah that the Almoravids should live in a town where its dwellings were modest and of an equal height. This town was called 'Arat/Aret-n-anna' (3-R-T-N-N-Y), see Levtzion and Hopkins, Corpus of Early Arabic Sources , p. 71. cAbd Allãh b. Yãsln ordered that 'no building should be higher than any other and they complied. 8 Quotations from the Qur'an are taken from M.A.S. Abdel Haleem, The Qur'an: English Translation and Parallel Arabic Text (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010). 9 The womenfolk of the so-called 'Blue Men of Southern Morocco' (Tikna, Rgayabãt etc.) still have a manner of arranging their hair within a headcover that recalls the hump of the 'Bactrian camel' description of Ibn Tümart' s text. See, for example the picture in Maurice Croizard and</page><page sequence="10">164 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Pierre Galante, Les Hommes Bleus au Maroc (Lausanne (Vilo-Paris): Nouvelles Editions S.A., 1956), p. 19. 10 This is a problematic term to render into translation. E.W. Lane offers three specific uses of hawd in the possible context of Ibn Tumart's text: (i) saqãka Allãh bi-hawd al-rasul ('may God give thee to drink from the pool of the Apostle'), (ii) unsibba calayhim hawd al-ghamãm ('the reservoir of the clouds, and the reservoirs thereof, poured forth upon them'), (iii) mala'a hawda udhunihi bi-kathrat kalãmihi ('he filled the concha of his ear with the abundance of his speech'), see E.W.
