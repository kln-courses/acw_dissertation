<plain_text><page sequence="1">II. TRADITION AND TRANSFORMATION by RICHARD MacCORMAC, BA&gt; MA, RIBA MacCormac, Jamieson and Prichard , Architects, delivered to the Society on Monday 18th April 1983, with Sherban Cantacuzino, MA, F RIBA, Secretary, Royal Fine Art Commission, and a Member of Council of the Society, in the Chair the CHAIRMAN: Tonight we shall hear the second of the three Bossom Lectures on the general theme of The Architect and Tradition*. Last week the art his- torian, Robin Middleton, spoke about The Use and Abuse of Tradition in Architecture'. He cited historical examples, mainly from the late eighteenth century on- wards, of the way different architects have made use of tradition in their work, and he castigated our contem- porary architects for abusing the past by trivializing it. We were left in no doubt about the importance of knowing our past, of studying our traditions, not super- ficially for their outward appearance, but for the meaning that lies behind their forms. Middleton gave one or two examples that seemed to him to be heading in the right direction - some of the work of Aldo Rossi, and the teaching of Dalibor Vesel√Ω at the Architectural Association, whose approach is to ask his students to tackle a commonplace problem like the commercial street, about which there is a wide measure of agree- ment. Personally I believe the picture to be a little more encouraging. The rejection of the past by the Modern Movement in architecture, as Middleton said, was more a matter of polemic than of practice. It would be interesting and instructive, for instance, to examine the work of the leaders of that movement and of their followers for its traditional content, however much that content may have been absorbed, re-interpreted and transformed by the ordinary person. And this is, I think, where our speaker tonight comes in, because his lecture is entitled Tradition and Transformation' . Richard MacCormac is not only a very good archi- tect, but also a perceptive critic of architecture; and, if I may be allowed to paraphrase T. S. Eliot and sub- stitute the word 'architects' for 'writers', 'some . . . architects are superior to others solely because their critical faculty is superior'. My first encounter, some fifteen years ago, was with MacCormac the writer and critic, when he submitted for publication in the Archi- tectural Review a brilliant analysis of the geometry in Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture. There followed a series of articles, the last during my time at the Review being a searching essay called 'Housing and the Dilemma of Style'. Housing, in fact, has been one of Richard MacCormac's chief pre-occupations as an architect, and with his partner, Peter Jamieson, he has built it at Milton Keynes, at Warrington and at Duffryn in Wales - housing which breaks new ground, and which I urge you to go and look at. His other work which I want to recommend to you is his latest - a residential building for Worcester College at Oxford, which he won in a limited competition. It will hardly come as a surprise to you that Richard MacCormac obtained a First Class Honours Degree in Architecture at Cambridge. He is an outstanding product of that school in its vintage years, when it was under the imaginative direction of Sir Leslie Martin. He later went back to teach there, and became a Uni- versity Lecturer in 1976. In introducing Richard MacCormac to you I am also able to announce that from tomorrow he will be appointed a Member of the Royal Fine Art Commission, where his fine critical abilities will be much valued by my Commissioners and myself. The following lecture , which was illustrated, was then delivered. MY tising or INTENTION historian, architect neither rather is to of speak than which as as a a I critic prac- am. tising architect rather than as a critic or historian, neither of which I am. Nevertheless the challenge of an occasion like this is that it invites the practitioner to look about him and try to define his relationship with the critical terrain in which he works and of which he is part. 740 On being asked to speak in this series 'The Architect and Tradition', my initial thought was that this subject would not have arisen as an urgent topic a decade ago. It seems to me that present interest arises from a series of reactions which form the background to the discussion. It must be said that we are in a recession and this is an important factor, in both a psychological and</page><page sequence="2">NOVEMBER 1983 THE ARCHITECT AND TRADITION II FIGURE 1. Urban disintegration in London's East End economic sense, in causing us to re-evaluate our situation. We are reacting against the effects of radical ideas which have not been absorbed or accepted. The Utopian intentions of the Modern Move- ment have been visibly disruptive. We have become suspicious of change, of the new, and of transitoriness. We are also suspicious of the claims of science and particularly of social science to predict. The present mood is one of recollection, pragmatism and recovery of what worked before. Modern architecture in its heroic phase pro- jected a new future and the damage it has done, as we see it from our present view of the world, is not only that it has left us with fragments of unfulfilled prophecy but with the partially dis- mantled fabric of our inheritance; I am thinking of remnants of cities such as the East End of London, the remains of streets, terraces and squares and of the damaged social fabric which is inherent in that physical fabric (Figure 1). To speak in this way is to oppose not only the revolutionary intentions of the 1920s and '30s but more specifically the simplistic functionalism and obsession with technique which arose during the 1960s and is still part of current practice. Technology was to become the prevailing dis- cipline of architecture, which would transform not only the appearance of buildings but release their occupants from the constraints that heavy permanent materials had supposedly imposed upon them. Buildings would be completely flexible and unspecific, perhaps transitory and impermanent, The corollary of this was that the traditional values of architecture - its capacity to make places, to embody institutions and occasions and to be a social memory, a monu- ment - would be superseded. The progenitors of this view were the Archi- gram Group, Cedric Price and Reyner Banham, the outstanding image, Ron Herron's Walking City. To actually build the ideal of a dematerialized and completely flexible architecture is highly exacting and, perhaps fortunately, there are few examples. The Centre Pompidou in Paris is one. This building is a tour de force but its aesthetics are related to structure and servicing rather than questions of architecture. Its success is as a public arena and, paradoxically, as a Parisian monument, like the Eiffel Tower. But because of its peculiar technological polemic and its rejection of context it can offer nothing as a prescription for the future of cities. Another belief of the '60s was that the study of architecture, which had gained academic res- pectability as a university discipline, would virtually become a science in which physics, chemistry and mathematics would be harnessed to psychology and sociology to determine an objective approach to design. This belief was most insistently developed at the Bartlett School at University College, subse- quently to be renamed the School of Environ- mental Studies, after the inauguration of Llewellyn Davies as Professor in 1960. Reyner Banham as senior lecturer in history participated by shifting the study of architectural history away from questions of value and aesthetics towards what he saw as factual accounts of buildings described in terms of their technology, use, budget and social context. Because this emphasis was upon science, questions of subjectivity and of idiom or of tradi- tion were seen as irrational intrusions into an objective world in which the explicit require- ments of the brief 'the programme', would determine the outcome. It was not felt, to para- 741</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS FIGURE 2. The fireplace as a family focus phrase Sir John Summerson's conclusion to his RIBA paper of 1957, 'The Case for a Theory of Modern Architecture', that there could be another expressive principle that could be compatible with the 'programme' as the source of form - there could not be two organizing principles. Now there is a pragmatic theory to counter this quasi-scientific scheme. We can say that many of the issues facing a designer do not con- sist of a problem and a solution in a dissociated sequential sense. For example, the design of a house; the house holds within its traditional or customary form many implicit characteristics which cannot be abstracted out as a 'problem'. The rational and objective view of the house in the 1960s made it a 'dwelling unit' and the idea of a 'social programme' untrammelled by custom produced tower blocks. What is implicit in the customary may only become apparent as the consequence of change. Perhaps the family significance of the open fire has only been fully realized through the loss of that focus as the result of central heating (Figure 2). My second objection to the purely rational viewpoint, which holds that the programme is the only source of form, is that it denies that architectural thought is itself a medium like language, mathematics and music. The rational view would not admit this because it was thought that the medium would have an expressive life of its own which would compromise the outcome. The classical tradition once provided this medium but what I am talking about at this point in my argument is not the outward meaning of classicism as a style but its use as a vocabulary for the designer. Current theories about the actions of design are concerned once again with the designer's need for pattern and precedent to help embody the programme. I believe that this is inevitable and necessary. It has always been the basis of studio teaching in schools of archi- tecture in a teaching tradition concerned with the development of skill and realization. It antedates the other nineteenth-century profes- sions like medicine and engineering which became the dominant scientific models for university education and towards which architecture belatedly tried to adapt itself. I have described two ideologies of the 1960s, both of which I see as perversions of science, and attacks on the traditions of architecture; the first, an extension of '30s utopianism, gave technology the status of an end rather than a means; the second denied the medium of archi- 742</page><page sequence="4">NOVEMBER 1983 THE ARCHITECT AND TRADITION II FIGURE 3. Le Corbusier : Villa Shodhan tectural design itself. Both were evasions of sub- jective value. Karl Popper, in his essay 'Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition', saw the social functions of tradition as a protection against such false claims. He described two purposes of tradition in society as follows: 'Traditions have the import- ant double function of not only creating a certain order out of something like a social structure, but also of giving us something on which we can operate; something which we can criticize and change. Just as the invention of myth or theories in the field of natural sciences has a function - that of helping us to bring order into the events of nature - so has the creation of tradition in the field of society.' Popper's double function consists on the one hand of a conventional order of public values and on the other of an operative system open to intervention and change. I think we can speak of the idiom of architecture as having equiv- alent functions. It should represent shared values which enable people to make judgements about their environment, and it should simul- taneously be capable of continuous transforma- tion and the expression of the arcane as well as the popular. I am interested, as you will see, in the idea of an architecture which can be readily accessible and sympathetic in its overt and public presence and yet secret and excellent when penetrated and understood at the deepest level. I will argue for an architecture in which several traditions can co-exist. Such a view is quite distinct from the single- mindedness which dominated the polemic of the Modern Movement. The shift in attitude was argued most persuasively by the American architect and writer Robert Venturi in his in- fluential little book Complexity and Contradic- tion in Architecture. His argument is itself complex and fragmentary, but broadly it is that whole- ness need not be simple in a reductive sense but can accommodate complexities and conflicting meanings which reflect the reality of the world and give the whole a poignancy and tension, which it would not otherwise have. I suspect that from the point of view of his- torians Venturi's method is itself an abuse of tradition, for he is a magpie who has stolen from architecture of different periods. The power and justification in this is that he is informed by an utterly fresh and creative sensibility. Under his discussion of ambiguity he includes the fa√ßade 743</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS of Bernini's Palazzo Propaganda Fide which may or may not consist of pilasters; Lutyens' garden fa√ßade at Nashdom, where the dip in the centre sets up a duality, and Le Corbusier's Shodhan House (Figure 3) in India where an exactly defined cube is seemingly disintegrated by its randomly open surfaces. In Venturis essay architectural traditions are a resource which becomes alive if we can think them anew and transform them. He quotes T. S. Eliot, who says, ≈•. . . if the only form of tradition, of handing down, consisted in following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind and timid adherence to its successes, "tradition" should be discouraged Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour.' T –æ transfer Eliot's rigour to the art of design is to see design as a crucible in which a process of transformation takes place. Recently it has become fashionable to talk of a revival of the actual elements of classicism, of columns and pediments made of easily moulded materials such as glass- reinforced plastic. In Eliot's terms such literal use of traditional elements is facile and lacks a deeper integrity. I am going to look at various ways in which tradition has been absorbed into modern archi- tecture, both in the inter-war period and in recent work, including that of my own practice. We associate the works of Mies van der Rohe with the reductive idea of modern architecture as it finally developed towards the suave and featureless glass box. However, his early work as an apprentice was in the romantic/classical tradition of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, probably the greatest architect of the romantic period in Europe. What interests me is that his sudden invention of a modern architecture, distinguished by the continuity of internal and external space, flat roofs and steel columns nevertheless dis- tilled Schinkel's style. The famous Barcelona Pavilion is a quintessential building of modern architecture and yet in the Schinkel tradition it is also a romantic garden pavilion with podium and limpid pool, the parts asymmetrically dis- posed. This sense of tradition, to quote Eliot, 'involves perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its present'. Just as Philip Johnson placed Mies' early work in the Schinkel School so Colin Rowe placed Le Corbusier in the tradition of classicism in two 744 famous essays, 'Mannerism and Modern Archi- tecture' and 'The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa'. In the latter the comparisons are between the villas of Palladio and Le Corbusier's Villas Savoye and Garƒçhe. The common aspiration of each architect is a poetic vision of perfected geometry, set against nature. The continuity here is arcane and mythical; Corb's clients are invited to be of their own time and yet participate in an ancient European consciousness. Corb's private clients relished his allusions but he failed to please the public elsewhere. I am not thinking only of the disastrous effect of his Unit√© d'Habitation as a prescription for popular housing but of his more modest scheme built at Pessac in 1925. The failure here was to comprehend tradition in the sense of popular convention. These were houses for people of low income who had no understanding of Corbusier's intentions. The white cubist style reminded them of North Africa and so the scheme became known as the 'Moroccan settlement'! Subsequently the houses have been adapted by their owners with pitched roofs and a range of embellishments in an attempt to bring them into the suburban tradition of the bourgeoisie. The dilemma is whether it is possible to reconcile architecture, as an inventive art, that creates new sensibilities, with customary expecta- tions. I have discussed how Mies and Corbusier gave a deeper temporal dimension to their work by absorbing a tradition into a new aesthetic. Now I want to consider the inverse, that fresh sensibility can be created within an old conven- tion. Some architects would regard such an intention as compromise, for it goes against the notion of sustaining a radical avant garde, an ideal which has its artistic origin in the overturn of French academic painting in the nineteenth century. But, at a deeper level, this is probably a political issue of the kind which Popper addressed in his essay. European modern architecture was involved with the possibility pf radical social change and perhaps the concept of aesthetic revolution continues as a surrogate of this. This is why I find the American architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright at the turn of the century a more appropriate model for our present Circumstances, because as I shall show, his inventions were created within the convention of an existing tradition. This could be said to be true of Lutyens also, but Lutyens did not so change our sensibility.</page><page sequence="6">NOVEMBER 1983 THE ARCHITECT AND TRADITION II FIGURE 4. Frank Lloyd Wright : typical Prairie period house - Highland Park Wright, like Lutyens, inherited the idiom of the arts and crafts movement, the American suburban version of which has been documented by Vincent Sully as the 'shingle style'. The characteristics of the shingle style were a freely disposed plan extending into garden terraces and verandas protected from the sun by over- hanging roofs. The houses were often stratified because of changes of material from substantial masonry plinths to economic superstructures of timber frame which enabled windows to be arranged in continuous strips. These, of course, were all ingredients of Wright's style from 1 900- 1912, his so-called Prairie period, and con- tinued to affect the idiom of all his house designs (Figure 4). Now Wright showed in early projects that he was also an accomplished classicist, something which later he would not admit, because he despised the literal classicism of his east coast contemporaries. The source of his classicism was not the Beaux Arts, but, unexpectedly, his Froebel kindergarten training. Froebel was probably trained as an architect in the system of education developed by Durand at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris at the end of the eighteenth century. This consisted of exercises in symmetrical composition based on an underlying grid. In Froebel's kindergarten the main exercise required children to dispose blocks in a range of sym- metrical patterns. Some of these are three- dimensional and represent buildings or furniture but generally they are abstract, and the abstract qualities are architecturally important. The patterns are unities which seem simple but actually consist of many parts (Figure 5). Often other figures can be seen within the overall figure, generally squares and cruciforms, and the interesting thing about these is that they are not complete - they are inferred and we imagine them. Another quality is that of the con- tinuity of the pattern from within to without. The aesthetic of Wright's early houses is closely comparable. They have an overall unity which Wright called simplicity but it is not a simplicity achieved by reduction. Instead it is paradoxical simplicity of many parts and sub patterns. Like the Froebel exercises the house plans generally consist of interpenetrating squares and cruci- forms which accommodate all the complexities of a domestic programme as it has previously developed in the suburban shingle style (Figure 6). 745</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS FIGURE 5. Patterns of the Froebel kindergarten Wright's houses are therefore recognizably part of a conservative middle-class housing tradi- tion given a new meaning by the transformation of arcane tradition, that of late eighteenth-century French classicism. Wright's absorption of classicism is integral with the other aspects of his architecture in con- trast to post-modern classicism, which fails to achieve the status of architecture because of its lack of integrity. For example, Michael Graves' Public Ser- vices Building at Portland, Oregon, is really a very boring chunk of office block decorated with neo-classical and Egyptian motifs like an iced cake, while Charles Moore's 'Piazza d'Italia' in New Orleans is an even more literal edible artifice. Of this Moore wrote, ≈•I remembered that the architectural orders were Italian, with a little help from the Greeks, and so we thought we could put Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns over the fountain, but they over- shadowed it, obliterating the shape of Italy. So instead we added a 'Delicatessen Order' that we thought could resemble sausages hanging in a shop window, thus illustrating its transalpine location'! An English architect who seems to me to have achieved something more profound is John Outram. Associated at one time with a literal classicism because of his entry for the Burrell Museum Competition, he has recently com- pleted a row of factory units at Kensal Road, London, which present an unexpected and highly original series of images which exactly comple- ment the practical requirements of the brief, office space, sheltered loading bays and so forth FIGURE 6. Analysis of use of Wright's house showing the underlying classical grid 746</page><page sequence="8">NOVEMBER 1983 THE ARCHITECT AND TRADITION II FIGURE 7. John Outram: factory at Kensal Road (Figure 7). I had best quote part of Outram's own description of his work: Each of the five pediments along Kensal Road shelters a similar being: a cylinder of bricks. This ideal (Platonic) form stands in the traditional position of the statue in its aedicule, that is centralized on the axis of the fastigium. Yet the cylinder also mimics the r√¥le of the guardians of the aedicule, that is the columns, those transforma- tions of person into pillar which become the Orders. FIGURE: 8. Jeremy Dixon : St. Mark's Road housing The cylinder-as-column is topped by a black band, a mere incinerated residue, a stratified deposit of the reduction of its capital to its material equivalent. Outram's strongly personal classical allusion- does succeed - giving a subliminal potency to buildings which are overtly practical and modern. Another project which reveals a surprising transformed classicism is Jeremy Dixon's low cost housing scheme at St. Mark's Road in West London (Figure 8). Where Outram's classicism is subsumed within the idiom of the conventional portal frame factory, Dixon's is within the brick vernacular of the late Victorian terrace. The pedimented porches have the anthropomorphic presence of a child's drawing of a house, fore- head, eyes and nose. The composition is fresh and yet the idiom is familiar, practical and cheap. This is in contrast to work by Leon Krier, such as his School project at Quentin en Yvelines, where his idea that a school should be represented as a kind of city in miniature consisting of an assembly of classical building types proved to be unrealizable because it was 500 per cent over budget. The idea was too literal. Edward Cullinan's work is especially interest- ing to me. He has shown, through numerous projects, most recently a theatre conversion of a Victorian building for Winchester College, how the constraints of tradition initiate invention. His conference centre at Minster Lovell near Oxford takes a series of Cotswold stone buildings and adapts them for modern use. Externally roofs and walls are extended in traditional materials but new forms, and the old setting is 747</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS FIGURE 9. MacCormac, Jamieson &amp; Prtchard: study of Spitalfields newly perceived. The interiors are transformed by extraordinarily inventive joinery. I see these buildings as equivalent to Wright's early work, in which a new tradition breaks out of an existing one and through this evolutionary rather than revolutionary process the art of architecture is advanced. The projects from my own office which I am going to show are obviously responses to the current needs of various clients, but I think they also meet other kinds of expectation, rooted in past experience, which include a sense of urban history, social conventions and institutional traditions. We have recently made some studies of London's East End. I started my talk with a slide showing the disintegration of the eighteenth and nine- teenth-century urban tradition of London. The intention of these studies has been to look at ways of reconstituting the fragments such as truncated terraces of houses, with party walls and fireplaces revealed, like the limbs of a wounded architecture! The public policy of providing inner city green space by breaking through existing street systems is a major cause of the disintegration and the result, in terms of urbanism, is as demoralizing as the blitz. 748 Our projects show how stranded buildings can be restored to a context, terraces infilled, and common land built around, rehabilitated and made secure though still available to the public. The terrace tradition can be re-established using very low cost housing which is greatly needed in the East End (Figure 9). Another more complex study was for a hypo- thetical redevelopment of the site currently used by Spitalfields fruit and vegetable market. The towers and slabs of modern commercial develop- ment largely reflect the prejudice of pension fund managers and their agents. We set out to demonstrate that very high commercial plot ratios could be achieved by buildings of a tradi- tional urban scale of about five storeiys and that large commercial sites could consist of streets with shops and other uses at ground level with offices above. The windswept spaces around single use office blocks of modern development represent a loss of tradition which I feel to be more funda- mental and, given institutional resistance, more difficult to retrieve than questions of style. Our failure, as a practice, to win the competition for the commercial development on the site of old Kensington Town Hall probably reflected</page><page sequence="10">NOVEMBER 1983 THE ARCHITECT AND TRADITION II FIGURE 10. MacCormac, Jamieson &amp; Prichard : new housing at Great Linford ' Milton Keynes institutional prejudices about form and style. Ironically our attempt to retrieve something of the nineteenth-century free style tradition seems to have been incompatible with the institutional tradition of modern office development. Most of the work of my practice has been housing, in both the public and private sectors. As a building type housing is paradoxical. It is highly constrained by social convention but is also open to a wide variety of possible arrange- ments and subject to changes in requirements and constraints which affect it. Housing design must be innovative, both to sustain subjective spontaneity and to react to newly defined needs. For example, it is not generally realized that nearly 30 per cent of current demand is for single people rather than families. The three housing schemes I am going to show are a village extension, a large public estate and a group of flats for young single people. Great Linford (Figure 10): Our design for an extension to the village of Great Linford in Milton Keynes set out to reconcile the suburban expectations of the new town residents with the image of a village. Car parking was the most difficult issue as cars in front of houses tend to destroy the sense of a street. So parking is tucked into small yards immediately accessible from back gardens and defined by walls and screens of different scales so that the houses become true street houses. Oakwood (Figure 11): The scheme for 320 houses at Oakwood in Warrington New T own is largely prefabricated from timber frames, a technique which will probably supersede tradi- tional brickwork in the event of a sudden expan- sion of house building. Part of the potential economy of prefabricated timber construction is to clad it in light material. The problem, as in the 1940s, is to overcome the associations of meanness and transitoriness which are the popular reaction to 'prefabs'. So the image of the Warrington scheme is one of half timbering, perhaps even what Osbert Lancaster called 'Stockbroker's tudor', and this overlays allusions to economy. Coffee Hall, Milton Keynes (Figure 12): This is a group of flats for about a hundred young single people in the new town - a relatively new kind of brief for architects. We sought a precedent in the collegiate tradition of courts, which might seem inappropriate and out of context, but our judgement was that this would be a community with its own management and social relation- 749</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS FIGURE 11.

MacCormac, Jamieson &amp; Prichard: the Sainsbury Building , Worcester College , Oxford ships. As with many of our projects we have been back and asked questions. We have found that the idea of a precinct is appreciated, for it establishes a territory which deters intruders, gives a sense of privacy and concentrates its own atmosphere. Worcester College, Oxford (Figure 1 3): My final example is our undergraduate building for Worcester College, Oxford, the Sainsbury Building, as it is now called. This provides 30 student rooms, guest rooms and common rooms. During the design we concluded that the building was like a satellite of the main college and this suggested that it should be offered as a model of the old by presenting a series of analogies. So with a gatehouse it offers a fa√ßade to the street, with wings and pediment-like roof which are like the components of the main entrance to Worcester College at a smaller scale; it offers a sequence, entrance quadrangle, loggia and view over the gardens, which is equivalent to the un- folding views which are revealed by walking through the college itself. CONCLUSION As a background I described how functionalism developed into a radical attack on the traditional place-making r√¥le of architecture. I went on to discuss, at some length, the dilemma which arose from the failure of modern design theory to reconcile expressive principles with 'objective' problem solving. My counter arguments were that most archi- tectural problems include the implicit and customary and cannot be redefined objectively, and that design cannot isolate itself from vocabulary and precedent because they are in- herent in the process of thought itself. There can be no Tabula Rasa. I quoted Karl Popper's essay on Tradition because it offered the idea of a shared order of values open to intervention and change. I proposed that architecture should similarly satisfy several levels of understanding, including that of the past so long as the past is transformed to become part of the present and not used literally. I explored these ideas by contrasting the Euro- pean Modern Movement with the architecture of F. L. Wright. Whereas the early work of Mies and Corbusier offered a radical aesthetic infused with classicism, Wright's early work continued a suburban convention out of which a new aesthetic emerged. In contrast to the revolutionary intent of the European Modern Movement I saw Wright's work as a kind of radical conservatism which seemed to conform with Popper's idea of tradi- tion as an instrument of evolutionary change. I concluded with examples of current practice including my own work and argued for a lively modern architecture in which several traditions can coexist. DISCUSSION THE CHAIRMAN: I was particularly interested by two slides of the Villa Garche and the Barcelona Pavi- lion. The way you explained the history in them was fine for most of us, but the ordinary person will not see this at all as a transformation of something traditional or historical. The ordinary person whose anger has now been aroused against architects demands the obvious, the superficial, the trivial. You may say 'Forget the or- dinary person, or educate him'. But if you then turn to the early Frank Lloyd Wright, to the prairie houses and so on, you do there have something that combines the traditional and the obvious with the depth of a per- 751</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS sonai and new syntax, and to some extent that is also true of Ted Cullinan's work and yours. You would not do the Villa Garche to-day, and I wonder whether the language should be obviously traditional, but the way it is put together, the syntax, should be new. THE LECTURER: That is certainly what I find in- teresting and important about Wright. I take the point you are making, which is implicit in what I was say- ing. I think we are in a situation where architects have to recover an understanding from society, from peo- ple, and I see Wright as providing a model for that. In our public housing we have tried to do that by using a very familiar idiom of materials. MR. JOHN OUTRAM: I should like to take up the point about the use of a conventional, customary sort of lexicon. I think that in fact this does increase the horse power of your language because it deals with experiences which are common to all of us, and it gives architecture the command of a language which is based upon experience in the way that you described. When you are grappling with something new you try to test it against your own experience rather than a theory. This whole approach was rejected by Le Corbusier and his followers in their definition of a rational utopia, and in a sense one can see that they were trying to crack a nut with a sledge-hammer. One can solve problems without such a radical approach. THE LECTURER: I agree, but must admit to the possibility that the avant garde is a kind of ideal of surprising creativity which is obviously opposed to the conservative state of mind in England about the environment. One of the symptoms of this is the so- called vernacular housing, that you see everywhere. There is a worry for me about how to continue such a traditional idiom. Wright seemed to have one idiom always emerging out of another one; that is the way I hope it could work. But I also like houses like Michael Hopkins', which are radical and not apparently popular. Suppose a successful popular magazine suddenly managed to persuade their readers that they should all live in such houses. It is possible, isn't it? MR. PETER AHRENDS: I was interested in your choice of Frank Lloyd Wright as an architect you appreciate and admire. You referred mainly to the prairie houses. I was wondering in what way you would connect what you have been saying to some of Wright's later work which is so very different from those houses? I have in mind non-housing work such as Johnson Wax, or some of the Usonian housing work. THE LECTURER: The reason I chose the housing was because I think that housing is the most sensitive issue. Institutions and big corporations like Johnson Wax build for special reasons which have not to do 752 with any kind of general social consensus. What is in- teresting about Wright is that he establishes a radical syntax within an old convention, and he proved that by actually persuading people to buy the houses. That is very important. I am not sure what sort of relation- ship corporations have with their architects, but I am fairly sure about the sort of relationship which private individuals must have with their architects. It is more testing. It is where Corbusier did not succeed. MR. AHRENDS: The corporation problem is with us as a reality as much as housing. PROFESSOR MICHAEL BRAWNE (School of Architecture and Building Engineering, University of Bath): It is also a question of what is imitable and what is not. You are being slightly unfair to the Villa Savoie because, after all, like a Palladian villa, it was never meant to form part of a city. It was a building in the middle of fields. The question is therefore whether it is an appropriate model for a repetitive building. Surely Frank Lloyd Wright's earlier houses were imitable. He knew that they could exert an influence and be imitated, so should we not be a little fairer to the past and say it is not only that one is of value and the other is not, but also that we perhaps associate value with that which can be taken on further? the CHAIRMAN: I wonder whether early Frank Lloyd Wright is indeed imitable; so is Mies van der Rohe, or mature Mies, and look with what results. I cannot think of any early Frank Lloyd Wright that has been imitated successfully. PROFESSOR BRAWNE: They were imitated in Holland. THE LECTURER: There were also some American imitators who were quite good. MR. JOHN OUTRAM: Wright used a domestic lex- icon which is a very common one, and therefore quite easy to imitate and to test against public opinion, but a corporation is dealing with concepts, with ideas, such as rationality, pr√©fabrication, mechanization, which are embodied in architecture. THE LECTURER: My recent brush with the world of finance on the Kensington Town Hall scheme sug- gested to me that it is not rational, that it is al$o depen- dent on myths, because the people who actually dominate it work on a myth basis, and seem to be lemming-like. If somebody really succeeded in pro- ducing an architectural idea which was financially per- suasive but quite different from the office block idea that has prevailed and still prevails, they would all run lemming-like in that direction. It is just a question of confidence. It was quite evident that we did not share</page><page sequence="14">NOVEMBER 1983 THE ARCHITECT AND TRADITION II the same myths or traditions as they did, and we were not able to prevail. Whether it was the appearance of my drawings, or my own personal appearance, I do not know. I do not think it is impossible for that world to share and come to some consensus with the architectural world about what is worth building; the secret and the excellent could occur within the conventional. MR. OUTRAM: It is a degenerating convention as you say, and to respond to it by writing new myths does seem a rather desperate solution. THE LECTURER: Consider the terrace convention in the eighteenth century. It was only a short while ago that I suddenly realized that Bedford Square was a degraded version of Woburn. It is still rather good compared to ordinary spec housing. Then Nash is really very good indeed; he takes the convention of speculative housing, which is to sell people about as narrow a plot for a house as you can, and makes it splendid. Maybe there is some equivalent commercial possibility now- adays, but it does not seem to work at the moment. MR. CHARLES KNEVITT, BA(Hons) (Architecture Correspondent, The Sunday Telegraph): I wonder whether you have come to any conclusions about the optimum scale of building, because most of your schemes are modest in size. If you were to work on a much larger scale - say, for example, if you had the Vauxhall Cross site on the South Bank of the Thames - would you not find it very difficult to come to terms with that? THE LECTURER: I am not sure what the answer is. In the larger public housing schemes that we have done we have been worried about the scale. I am not sure what models one refers to. Going back to Nash, it does seem to me that he managed to do Regent's Park pretty convincingly. Maybe the language that he was dealing with was capable of a lot of syntactical variety, which we generally do not have. It is perhaps also a question of how size is viewed. Apparently big things are supposed to be worse than small things. Maybe people will come to like big things again. MR. JOHN MELVIN: But surely it is a question of the syntactical freedom and richness that we are look- ing for. We can walk for half an hour through Georgian speculative terrace housing and not be bored; Nash could do it on a grand scale. We are looking for an equivalent solution to-day. What sort of vocabulary will give us this degree of flexibility and richness other than the classical which we cannot return to? THE LECTURER: I am not sure that Georgian building was all that wonderful. There was a recent series of lectures at the AA which I did not attend, but I saw the poster sub-titled 'One Damned House After Another', which was a quote presumably from some eighteenth-century commentator. Dublin is boring. There is much too much of it. I do not think that they were really any better at doing it than we are. I think Nash succeeds. I agree that the classical vocabulary allows him to. He does it by the boldness of scale of a kind difficult for people to accept nowadays, particu- larly in public housing. I wonder if we really do lack the syntax. MR. OUTRAM: Surely abstract architecture is all syntax and no lexicon? It refers to nothing except itself. It is an object, so it cannot have a lexicon. THE LECTURER: Marrying the syntax to the reference is the problem. Somebody who has been very helpful for me is Aldo Van Eyck, who said that the abstract terminology of the Modern Movement, the terms 'space' and 'time' should become 'place' and 'occasion'. You have to test everything you make against its content, which is the story-telling aspect of the thing, so there are many accounts of why the thing is as it is. One level might be very abstract, but other levels could be very prosaic. MR. OUTRAM: How far would you take this pro- cess? Would you take it into some sort of naturalistic decoration, so that your story would be legible? THE LECTURER: I would not at the moment. the CHAIRMAN: One way that does help architects to look at the past and understand tradition is con- sidering buildings as part of the city, rather than as isolated objects - as part of the street, as part of the square. That compels you to concentrate on the prob- lem of the context. I am not going to attempt to sum up, but I should like to complete a quotation, from T. S. Eliot, of which we heard the very beginning. You might be interested to have the whole of it, which means going back a little bit. 'Tradition involves the historical sense', Eliot wrote, 'and the historical sense involves a perception not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence. The historical sense compels a man to write' (perhaps I had better translate it into architecture) 'compels a man to build not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the architecture of Europe . . . and with- in it the whole of the architecture of his own country, has a simultaneous existence and composes a simul- taneous order. This historical sense is what makes a writer traditional, an architect traditional, and it is at the same time what makes an architect most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity.' I hope you will join me in thanking Richard MacCormac for his lecture to-day. 753</page></plain_text>
