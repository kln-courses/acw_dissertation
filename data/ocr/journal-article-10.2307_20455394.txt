The assemblages are characterised by a local variety of pottery, the so-called 'Red Brown Wash Ware', usually found in contexts associated with materials similar to those available from contemporaneous periods in northern Mesopotamia, northern Syria and Anatolia. As a consequence, this paper investigates the apparent cultural interactions which took place between the Mesopotamian and Anatolian regions during the above-mentioned period, drawing on recent data obtained at the site of Hirbemerdon Tepe located along the upper Tigris river valley in southeastern Anatolia. Through this overview, an additional objective is to bring to a broader public the material culture of this relatively little known yet increasingly significant region of the ancient Near East.

More specifically, the late third millennium BC witnesses the collapse of centralised political and economic systems and, in certain regions (for example, the Syrian Jazirah), radical climatic changes (Courty, Weiss 1997). This period is also marked by the displacement of different ethnic groups (for example, Hurrians, Gutians and Amorites) from the north into southern Mesopotamia (Weiss, et al. 1993: 1002). In northern Syria, northern Iraq and southeastern Anatolia the results of these dramatic socio-economic changes are also recognisable in the reorganisation of the regional settlement pattern, characterised by sites with smaller extensions and a higher degree of economic and cultural exchanges between different regions (Nichols, Weber 2006). In fact, it is during the early second millennium BC that both textual and archaeological evidence highlight an intense long-distance trade of both raw materials and finished commodities between merchants based in the Mesopotamian region and other local groups in the Iranian high plains, using eastern routes, and Anatolia, using northwestern routes (Larsen 1976; bahoglu 2005). However, although we have a clear idea about the routes connecting the ancient northern Mesopotamian site of Assur with the karum (commercial 77</page><page sequence="2">Anatolian Studies 2007 ports in Akkadian) of central Anatolia (Ozgti? 2003), little has been discovered about the connections between the communities settled in other important regions of the ancient Near East and involved in this fundamental economic phenomenon. In terms of the work discussed here, little information is available regarding the relationship between the communities of the northern Syrian Jazirah and those occupying the regions north of the Tur 'Abdin mountains. Thus, the new rescue archaeological projects related to the construction of the Ilisu dam along the upper Tigris river valley in southeastern Turkey (fig. 1), in which the Hirbemerdon Tepe Archaeological Project described here plays a part, will provide the possibility of recovering innovative data for the purpose of increasing under standing of the cultural relationships between this area and the settlements of the eastern (Iran), southern (northern Syria and Mesopotamia) and northwestern (central and northern Anatolia) regions of the ancient Near East during the late third and first half of the second millennia BC. Moreover, the importance of this region appears to be related not only to the economic opportu nities connected to the natural environment of the Tigris river, but also to its vicinity to copper sources (for example, the Ergani-Maden mines, Yener 2000: 57-64). Hirbemerdon Tepe It was for the purpose of producing the archaeological data necessary to clarify the role of this region in a wider geographical scenario that the ongoing archaeological excavations at the site of Hirbemerdon Tepe began in 2003 as a collaborative effort between the Archaeo logical Museum of Diyarbakir and the Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente (IsIAO). Hirbemerdon Tepe is a medium-sized site located along the west bank of the upper Tigris river valley in southeastern Anatolia, about 40km east of Bismil in the Diyarbakir province (figs 1, 2). Based on the archaeological research carried out during the first four years of excavation at the site, the archaeologists were able to define the overall chronology of the site and also began to uncover architectural remains on the High Mound and in the Outer Town. It was also established that the site's chronological horizon includes a Chalcolithic period of occupation (fourth millennium BC), which is characterised by a local Chaff Faced Ware and was probably limited to the Outer Town, as well as later and smaller occupations dating to the Iron Age and Islamic period (Laneri 2005). However, the most important archaeological phase occurred between the late third to the mid second millennium BC, distin guished by a high density of fragments of a locally produced pottery, the so-called 'Red Brown Wash Ware' (hereinafter RBWW). The archaeological phase of the late third to the mid second millennium BC As mentioned above, the late third millennium to mid second millennium BC horizon is the most represented archaeological phase at Hirbemerdon Tepe. In fact, among the material culture collected during the prelim inary survey more than 70% belongs to this specific period (Laneri in press). The settlement pattern of this period is characterised by: a) a major architectural complex, mostly dated to the first half of the second millennium BC, on the High Mound; b) scattered archi tectural features dedicated to working activities in the Outer Town; and c) a possible temporary settlement in the Lower Town (fig. 3; Laneri, et al. 2006). More specifically, the archaeological excavations in the Outer Town have brought to light two different sub-phases related to this main period of occupation: sub-phase B, dating to the late third to early second millennium BC; and sub-phase A, dating to the first half of the second millennium BC. Both sub-phases are marked by narrow walls constructed of pebbles and small-sized stones whose function was to separate large open spaces dedicated to craft manufacturing activities or used as stables. Moreover, in order to sustain these architectural features thick platforms and foundations were built during the earliest sub-phase (B). The discovery of two foundation deposits suggests a ritual importance given to the platform's construction by the ancient inhabitants during this earliest sub-phase: one inside a niche embedded in the stone platform, consisting of a cache of two fine ware globular bowls with ring bases and club-shaped rims; and 4m to the south, a second one underneath the stone platform, consisting of a fine ware globular bowl containing numerous river shells. As is demonstrated by the presence of numerous yellowish sandy layers cut by the platform, this ritual action can be interpreted as a ceremonial practice connected to the desire of the ancient inhabitants to prevent the flooding of the Tigris river. Furthermore, the decorative motifs of these three bowls are directly related to the two most distin guishable categories of pottery production of this region during the late third millennium BC, i.e., the RBWW assemblage and the Dark-Rimmed Orange Bowls (hereinafter DROB). The DROB is a type of bowl with a distinctive dark red dusky coloured band along the exterior rim and chronologically belongs to a post Akkadian, late third millennium BC, horizon (for comparisons see Tell Brak/Nagar Phase N, Oates, et al. 2001: fig. 401.271-75; Tell Mozan/Urkesh, Buccellati, Kelly-Buccellati 2000: 171; Ugtepe, Sevin 1993: R. 16.4; KavuJsan Tepe, Kozbe, et al. 2004: fig. 19; Ziyaret Tepe, Matney 1998: 23.5). 78</page><page sequence="3">Laneri, Valentini and D'Agostino noarmkrth 79N W Syria / ?n l?ntnlk * +l1 ,o/ 1!city limbf Usn I sonltreams_ 40+ Rivers Conltour linesFl Fig. 1.

This category of pottery has a distinctive surface treatment characterised by a highly burnished, monochrome or bi-chrome decoration, ranging in colour from 'red' to 'blackish red' and covering either the entire exterior vessel body or only its upper rim-shoulder section. Moreover, from a typological perspective the RBWW repertoire of sub phase B is marked by the presence of globular bowls with a groove below the rim and bowls with a club-shaped rim (Algaze 1990: 314, pl. 55), as well as storage jars with a hole mouth or a short neck (Algaze 1990: 316-17). In order to understand better the chronology of this phase, the discovery of a Gray Burnished Ware carinated beaker (for comparisons see Middle Bronze Age levels at Lidar H., Kaschau 1999: taf. 113, 135; late third/early second millennium BC phases F/G at Korucutepe, Griffin 1980: 4, pl. 9H; late third millennium BC contexts at Tell Mozan/Urkesh, Kelly-Buccellati 2002: 60) has helped the archaeologists to pair this phase with a late third to early second millennium BC chronological horizon. The RBWW assemblage is also predominant in the later sub-phase A, when this specific ceramic assemblage becomes typical for a large number of Middle Bronze Age sites within the upper Tigris river valley (Parker, Swartz Dodd 2003). However, the RBWW assemblage of sub-phase A shows some differences compared to the earlier production of sub-phase B. The open classes are characterised by carinated shapes (fig. 4) that have strong similarities with contemporaneous productions in both this and neighboring regions (for example, southeastern Anatolia, central-northern Syria and northern Iraq, Algaze 1990: 370-77; Nigro 1998). In particular, the typology of open form rims of this sub-phase recalls the Kurban III period that is characterised by 'incurved blunt and flattened rims' (Algaze 1990: 370, pl. 98). The storage jars continue the traditional production of the previous period and are marked by applied grooved bands and a decorative wavy incised line (this repertoire of storage jars has strong similarities with contempora neous contexts at other sites along the upper Tigris valley; see Gre Dimse, Karg 1999: 268, fig. 10.14; Kenan Tepe, Parker, et al. 2003: 158.j, k; Ziyaret Tepe, Matney 1998: 23.13, 15). In addition to RBWW fragments, sub-phase A is also characterised by a Painted Ware (pseudo-Khabur Ware) assemblage, which is helpful in connecting this archaeo logical phase to a specific Middle Bronze Age horizon (ca 1815-1550 BC, Khabur Ware period 2-3, Oguchi 1997: 196-99, fig. 1). In the case of the Painted Ware fragments found in the Outer Town, the exterior surfaces are decorated with a red paint applied either as horizontal stripes or vertical wavy lines, which consistently embellish the upper section of the vessel bodies (for general refer ences on Khabur Ware and its distribution, see Frane 1996; Hamlin 1971; Oguchi 1997; 1998; 1999; 2003). However, it is on the High Mound that the archaeol ogists have brought to light major architectural structures belonging mostly to the first half of the second millennium BC. These structures are very well preserved and form a large 'architectural complex' (fig. 5) that was planned following a northwest-southeast axis and is characterised by a series of terraces that served to level the natural slope of the hill. Due to the presence of double walls separating clusters of rooms, the entire complex was sub-divided into several agglutinated sections (buildings A-G). The overall architectural plan of this complex was centred on a staircase (building B, rooms 4, 5, 6) and a long alley comprised of flat limestone slabs that functioned as a link between two different terraces on which the whole building was founded. Based on the presence of numerous fragmented mud-bricks in the previously mentioned layer of collapsed debris, it can be assumed that the complex was probably constructed using a building technique that incorporated a foundation of mid-sized stone walls with a superimposed layer of mud-bricks. Drawing on this initial archaeological data, it can also be stated that the external courtyards were stone paved, while the internal rooms contained compacted clay floors (comprising mid-sized stones to large river pebbles). The construction technique of this complex has strong similarities with numerous southeast Anatolian sites that belong to a comparable chrono logical horizon, for example, the Middle Bronze Age building found at Girnavaz (Erkanal 1991: R.1).

One key component of this system is a drainage channel (building B, room 4) built between the external wall of a room dedicated to working activities (building A, room 3) and the southwestern side of the main staircase (building B, room 6). In this case, room 3 was connected to the main drainage system through a hole reserved within the wall. This type of drainage system has comparable examples dating to both the Middle Bronze Age (for example, the site of Imamoglu along the upper Euphrates valley, Uzunuslu 1985: R.7-8, and the karum of Kultepe, Ozguca 2003: fig. 55) and more recent periods, such as those used in numerous Tur 'Abdin area villages near the modern Turkey-Syria border (for example, Midyat in Mardin province). The function of the entire complex appears to be completely connected with a centralised organisation of activities dedicated to the processing and storage of food, as is demonstrated by the high number of storage and cooking jars, as well as grinding stones and mortars found in situ (i.e., building A, fig. 5). The pottery containers were probably originally located on the benches, and only the collapsing and subsequent sliding movement of the surrounding dirt transported them to a more central position. The discovery of a thick layer of burnt material and a high density of cooking ware in one of the complex's rooms (10/11, building C) allows the archaeologists to interpret this particular room as having been dedicated to roasting and/or cooking activities. As indicated by the discovery of stone mortars, two small rooms (14 and 15, building D) located along the outer alleyway in the northeastern section were used to grind and process food. From among the material culture found inside the rooms, the most common type repre sented is ceramic vessels. But together with the pottery, a high number of basalt grinding stones, limestone mortars, stone pestles and clay portable hearths were also discovered. Within the overall assemblage, the presence of decorated portable hearths (fig. 6) can be interpreted as both being related to the rooms' function and as evidence of ritual activities performed by individuals in some rooms of the High Mound 'architec tural complex'. Furthermore, in one of these rooms (court 12, building D) the archaeologists discovered a tripartite ceramic basin lying near a portable hearth decorated with anthropomorphic motifs. The tripartite basin further emphasises the possible ritual function of this section of the building, and, due to a possible comparison with a similar object found in the pre Mitanni levels at Yorgan Tepe/Nuzi in northern Iraq (Starr 1939: 405, pl. 95.a), helps the archaeologists in determining chronological links with the northern Mesopotamia regions between the late third and the first half of the second millennium BC. More specifically, from both a decorative and typological point of view, one of the Hirbemerdon Tepe portable hearths (fig. 6.3) is most similar to two horseshoe-shaped hearths discovered in one of the 'Khabur period houses' at Tell 82</page><page sequence="7">Laneri, Valentini and D'Agostino Z 13 W ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~lb o 5cm IC I K ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2c 2a 0 5cm C i~~~~ 0 &gt; Q ~ ~ 5cm Fig. 6.

This object's schematic incised anthropomorphic motifs are also comparable to another portable hearth found at Cinis Hoyuk (Takaoglu 2000: fig. 2a), as well as other hearths discovered at Beth Shan (Palestine), Tabara el-Akrad (Amuq region) and Shengavit (Armenia) (Takaoglu 2000: 11-13). Another portable hearth with an incised anthropomorphic decoration is a unique piece (fig. 6.1), but the decorative pattern recalls elements of the decoration of some large jars of the Early Transcaucasian Culture (ETC) horizon of the first half of the third millennium BC in northeastern Anatolia. In terms of the complex's chronological framework, a series of absolute dates proves that the complex was in use during the first half of the second millennium BC (2010-1416 BC), while the analysis of the pottery typology allows for the determination of a relative chronological framework that is comparable to the material culture of sub-phase A in the Outer Town with a very high density of carinated open forms (fig. 4) and storage jars of the RBWW assemblage, and, thus, is related to a Middle Bronze Age (first half of the second millennium BC) cultural horizon. Moreover, material culture belonging to a late third/early second millennium BC horizon (sub-phase B) was found in earlier floors of some rooms of the western part of the 'architectural complex'. This material culture is marked by the presence of globular shapes of the RBWW category usually associated with Dark-Rimmed Orange Bowls, Gray Burnished Ware, and, in one case, a complete profile of a fine ware bowl with a beaded rim. Although these shapes are only rarely represented at Hirbemerdon Tepe, they are comparable to other assemblages from a wide range of sites with material culture dating to the late third millennium BC. For example, this is demonstrated by the case of Tell Brak/Nagar in the Syrian Khabur valley, where similar shapes are associated with the site's post-Akkadian phase of occupation (phase N: Oates, et al. 2001: 161-63, figs 401.271-75, 415.526). As already mentioned, other possible comparisons for this specific assemblage are related to other sites of the Khabur valley (Tell Mozan/Urkesh), as well as settlements of the late third millennium BC along the upper Tigris river valley (Uctepe, Kavu?an Tepe, Salat Tepe and Ziyaret Tepe). Thus, this preliminary chronological information has allowed the archaeologists to determine that during a first stage (i.e., sub-phase B, late third/beginning of the second millennium BC) the settlement was originally concentrated in the Outer Town and in the western section of the High Mound, while during the first half of the second millennium BC (i.e., sub-phase A) the settlement was marked by a continuation in the use of the architectural features in the Outer Town and a wide expansion on the High Mound that is now characterised by the construction of the above-mentioned 'architectural complex'. Moreover, these elements also highlight the fact that the site expanded between the late third and the beginning of the second millennia BC, increasing in extent and, probably, in importance within the broader geo-political landscape of the upper Tigris river valley. Conclusions As mentioned in the introductory paragraph, the archae ological, textual and palaeo-environmental data available from Mesopotamia, northern Syria and southeastern Anatolia demonstrate that the late third millennium BC (post-Akkadian) phase is clearly marked by a re-organi sation of the social and economic structure of the communities inhabiting this broad geographical area. This transformed landscape follows the collapse of the imperial structure established by the Akkadian kings and is based on new forms of social and economic interac tions in which emerging ethnic groups (for example, Amorites, Hurrians, Gutians) played a fundamental role in the construction of the social systems of Near Eastern societies (Speiser 1952; Kamp, Yoffee 1980; Wilhelm 1989: 7-15; Steinkeller 1997). More specifically, the regeneration of the social system (Schwartz 2006) after the collapse of the Akkadian Empire is characterised by a new settlement pattern of medium- to small-sized sites that differs from the more complex three- to four-tier hierarchical system, that included smaller towns and villages, typical of the city-states of the mid to late third millennium BC (Cooper 2006). In most cases, the reorganisation of the economic resources (for example, long-distance trade, combined forms of subsistence) appears to be the pivotal element for restructuring the social fabric of these communities during the following period (i.e., the early second millennium BC, Oguchi 1999; Eidem 2000; Nichols, Weber 2006). A similar pattern of reorganisation is recognisable in the upper Tigris river valley during the late third and the first half the second millennium BC when the whole area is marked by the emergence of numerous small- to mid sized settlements (for example, Uctepe, Kavu?an Tepe, Kenan Tepe, Salat Tepe, Ziyaret Tepe, Hirbemerdon Tepe, Ahmetli Tepe) characterised by the locally produced 'Red Brown Wash Ware'. Thus, the higher density of settlements in the upper Tigris river valley during this specific chronological period can be inter preted as a clear indicator of the social reorganisation of the groups inhabiting this region following earlier political and environmental changes (Courty, Weiss 1997; Cooper 2006; Nichols, Weber 2006). In addition, this regenerative process could also have been linked to 84</page><page sequence="9">Laneri, Valentini and D'Agostino the establishment of long-distance commercial networks between the northern Mesopotamian regions and Anatolian centres (Oguchi 1999; Eidem 2000). Within this perspective, the upper Tigris river valley could have served as a dynamic niche along the route to the copper mines of Ergani-Maden, strengthened by the existence of both internal and external demands. As a consequence, the creation of a more complex system of producing and storing commodities at designated centres, such as the 'architectural complex' brought to light on the High Mound at Hirbemerdon Tepe, could have helped in the development of local forms of production and consumption of supplies, as well as commercial exchanges between this region and neighbouring areas. In conclusion, future archaeological research in the upper Tigris river valley will definitely increase the archaeological data regarding this interesting cultural and geographical niche that was pivotal in linking commu nities of the northern and southern regions of the ancient Near East between the late third and the mid second millennia BC.
