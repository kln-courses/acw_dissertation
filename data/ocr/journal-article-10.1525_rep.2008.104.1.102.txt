[When clouds billowed and formed thunderheads, and settled and hung about the mountain tops, it was said: “The Tlalocs are already coming. Now it will rain. Now the masters of the rain will sprinkle water.” ]1 An unknown indigenous tlacuilo (painter-scribe) was instructed by the Franciscan brother Bernardino de Sahagún to make a picture in con- cert with the written description of clouds with which I begin (fig. 1).2 As in the codex as a whole, executed around 1579, the collaboration between Spaniard and colonized informant in New Spain was a belated attempt to salvage a visual culture and religious practices largely extinguished by the first wave of conquest. The codex is a vestige of a complex preconquest ideographic tradition, one that would survive and be redirected to mapping out property boundaries and political relations. The Nahuatl glyph for water—the relaxed spiral shape in wash hovering near the lower edge of the inscribed frame—was used in legal documents to mark wells and other sources of water. The serial repetition of footprint glyphs surveyed mea- sured paths. In other words, the indigenous forms of the Nahua peoples persisted within an emergent colonial administration. In the codex at hand, however, the Franciscan commanded the formal articulation of a pagan religion that had been prohibited and whose objects had been destroyed. In the chapter “which telleth of the clouds,” the picture accompanies the phonetic transcription of the Nahuatl account of the deity Tlalocatecutli, who had been associated with clouds and rain. Sahagún’s indigenous informants were members of the former ruling class who had been trained in glyphic inscription and were given humanist educations in a missionary school.3 The tlacuilos and the Franciscans were engaged in a com- plex negotiation in the representation of clouds. The forbidden god was enmeshed in a dense graphic system that had developed independently of ABSTRACT In the Florentine Codex, an indigenous tlacuilo (painter-scribe) of sixteenth-century New Spain responded to imported European visual technologies by dissociating form from material require- ments. / REPRESENTATIONS 104.

Applying with a brush the opaque pigment sus- pended in liquid, the tlacuilo iterated the spiral glyph for water, creating a horizontal and vertical pattern. Each cloud-unit in the rough grid is a variant on the glyph based on the manual gesture of the tlacuilo. As in other sur- vivals of preconquest codices, the glyph constitutes a contour line; that is to say, the glyph assumes a shape with a bounded extension.4 A figure is cir- cumscribed by a continuous line and paint is applied to the interior.  Contour Clouds are complex aqueous systems that resist being bounded “things.” Clouds do not have finite edges. In this codex, the contours sur- rounding the clouds do not correspond to fixed shapes, nor do they depict occlusion.5 Elsewhere in the codex, water freezes on the page (fig. 2).

In these Nahuatl glyphs, the contour line defines the physical properties: the entangled, petrified water glyph, the set of continuous cir- cles, and the sharp terminations of the roughly rectangular forms. The latter formal series contributes to this codex’s historical narrative of catastrophe, wherein solid forms fallen from the sky despoiled fields of corn and crushed flocks of birds (“And thus did hail fall, making a din as of rattling, beating one about the head, pelting one [as if] with stones”). No doubt the tlacuilo’s subtle inflection of the line with the painful memory of a hailstorm was largely lost on the Franciscan.6 The European may have been more responsive to the tlacuilo’s experiments with translucent black wash on the white ground, suggesting the relative opacity and tumescence of clustering storm clouds. However, we can be assured that the European would have recognized the bounded shape as a cloud. The demarcated cloud indicates a shared notion of pictorial form, one premised on enclosure.  It is worth hesitating here. In the course of their negotiation, the Euro- pean Sahagún and the tlacuilos shared a set of common assumptions regard- ing the picture as bounded contour. Despite the messy convergence of glyph and alphabetic transcription of Nahuatl, there is a common ground, or at least the scribe anticipated some understanding of the enclosed forms on 104 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="4"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 105 the Spaniard’s part. This notion of shared pictorial reception might suggest a set of minimal requirements for the migration of the picture as symbol in the midst of the various noisy cross-cultural misunderstandings (something in the order of a distinctive feature, with a degree of apprehension or at least recognition of some symbolic function). Pictures, in this sense, are apparently subject to transmission because not only do they suggest an economy of sim- ilarity (depiction) but they are also predicated on the principle of substitu- tion and transposition. The notion of the transposition of symbols with discrete contours has had much currency in the discipline of art history, particularly with regard to the study of the diachronic and geographical transfer of icono- graphic motifs. In part, the study of attributes and emblems—a palm frond or an hourglass—was facilitated by the cataloging and reproduction of bounded linear figures. But the contour line also enjoyed an important conceptual value during the formation of art history in the early twentieth century. When Aby Warburg explored the figure of snake/lightning in Hopi culture and the persistence of pagan serpentine motifs in Christian Europe, he located the origins of symbolic form in the drawing of a con- tour. As Karen Lang has argued, Warburg transferred a term of Kantian logic referring to the determination of the extension of a class, the setting of boundaries, to the inscription of a “differentiating contour.”7 War- burg’s account of the resilience and migration of the symbol hinges on this distinctive formal feature. The survival of any given symbol is predi- cated on its formal differentiation from the ground that surrounds it.  Warburg’s notion of symbolic form helps us to appreciate what was at stake when the Franciscan and the tlacuilo agreed on the contour line. For Warburg, the “primary differentiating contour” has the effect of distancing subject and object as part of the obligatory estrangement of persons from things.8 For the Franciscan Sahagún, the disenchantment of the idols demanded their domes- tication as symbols, disciplined by contours provided by the indigenous informant. For the Nahuatl speaker and tlacuilo, the contours of the glyph insured the survival of indigenous material practices if not the gods them- selves. But in order to understand more fully the effects of this cultural con- vergence, our description of contour line has to move beyond Warburg’s and my own level of abstraction.  Invoking the word “form” can privilege structure to the detriment of material properties. One consequence of vernacular Aristotelianism is that the limits imposed on form by material constraints tend to be downplayed, even in scholarship attendant to historical description. The pressures of the material on form are particularly germane in the discussion of transcultural systems, where residual techniques face changes in material conditions brought about by conquest and colonization.

The tlacuilos were acutely aware of this as they adapted their techniques in response to the differences between the local paper made from the bark of fig trees (amatl) and imported paper made from textiles (rag). They knew that technical innovation can accommodate variations in material resources. They also knew that matter, form, and signification were not categorically distinct. In Nahuatl, “red ink, black ink” signifies wisdom or “knowledge of incalculable value.”9 In writing with ink, the legibility of the script was predicated on control- ling accidental seepage and the resulting disarticulation of stereotypic forms. Impression relied on the integrity of the paper’s reserve, the blank passages of the sheet. Viscosity and receptivity were constitutive of the formal proper- ties of script, determining the open and closed structures of the characters: the broad circumference of the “o”; the intricate negative capacities of the “e” and the “a.” In geographically diverse traditions, scribes adeptly directed the absorption of sepia or carbon-based pigments suspended in water through the coordination of manual pressure and relative velocity (weight and rapid- ity of movement factor into absorption). With the introduction of printed books to New Spain, the tlacuilos became aware that “red ink, black ink” was itself subject to material transfor- mation. In the absence of the scribe’s manual dexterity, the mechanical impression of typeface required innovations in the composition of ink. Oil was introduced to printer’s ink in order to forestall the uneven distribution of pigment applied to moveable type. The water-based ink used by scribes reticulated on the type’s metal surface, collecting in a minute fractured pat- tern. In the absence of oil, the indexical uniformity of the molded font and the predictable mechanical pressure of the press were compromised by the unanticipated consequences of rag paper’s irregular receptivity to the varie- gated inked typeface. These technical responses to the indiscriminate receptivity of ink by rag paper in both writing and the printing of words and contour figures were inadequate, however, to accommodate a demand in Europe to produce an extended field of graduated tone in ink drawing. Like the contour line, the historical emergence of differential tone on a surface as a pictorial conven- tion was a response to a historically specific set of cultural pressures. The tonal variation that developed as a systematic pictorial practice in Quattro- cento Italy and elsewhere in Europe was alien to the Mesoamerican glyphic tradition. In Italian painting, we can speak of tonal gradation as a volumetric object’s interference with its own illumination. This is often referred to as “modeling” or “shading.” Discrepancy of tone on a single depicted surface 106 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="6"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 107 also signified the interference of adjacent objects relative to a light source, thereby suggesting discrete things in space. The systematic gradation of tone is a simplification of the properties of light and shadow as perceived by the human eye. In contradistinction to the contour and opaque in-painting of the tlacuilo, tonal variation underscored the contingency of pictorialization with respect to human vision. As hieratic scale gave way to linear perspective in European art, symbolic color became subordinate to tonal variation. This was a peculiar development that would have had no foreseeable advantages for early fifteenth-century functionaries in Monteczuma’s empire, whose glyphs for paper were sufficient to represent the distribution of tribute. Chalk and rag paper were the dominant new media in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Italian studios (fig. 3). Importantly, whether red or black chalk was employed in preparatory drawings, experimentation took place with monochrome materials. The graduated application of manual pressure and the iteration of dispersed graphic marks in a uniform hue produced variation of tone. The disintegration of the soft solid in contact with the rough texture of the paper provided varying degrees of density and reserve. Shadow was similarly suggested by the use of translucent liquid media, such as wash on paper, by adjusting the density of pigment and the relative viscos- ity of the suspension with respect to a white paper ground. Whether using the constancy of hue of chalk or wash, the adjustment of tone without recourse to mixing pigment with white entailed the use of the white ground as an integral aspect of the picture. The transposition of these perceptual interests to the medium of ink on paper entailed considerable difficulties. Ink is unforgiving. Artists often made a preparatory sketch with a dry stylus before committing to the irre- versible stain. In order to depict a plane, saturation of the paper with ink was impractical and, significantly, ink’s opacity did not offer tools for depicting tonal gradation. A series of parallel and perpendicular lines seems to have been used to resolve the problem of controlling the uneven absorption of ink by the complex aggregate structure of rag sheets.10 In a pen drawing by the fifteenth-century Florentine artist Ghirlandaio, for example, sustained areas of dark tonality are suggested by directing the flow of ink with a sharp instrument (fig. 4). The depiction of shadow through tone has been substi- tuted by a notation based on the iteration of lines. The relative frequency of the intervals of discontinuous lines is in inverse relation to relative illumina- tion. Hatching, in this instance, is a notational system for differential tone that developed in response to the accidental or unmotivated properties of paper’s receptivity to ink.  The preconquest tlacuilos had no need for hatching because they had no interest in differential tone. This is not to say that the tlacuilo did not differ- entiate objects based on observation.11 But the contingencies of light with Clouds and Rain 107 </page> <page sequence="7"> REP104_10  10/31/08  14:45  Page 108 FIGURE 3.

Indeed, systematic hatching as a notation for differential illumination created unnecessary confusion in a glyphic system. The conceptual clarity of discrete place markers, phonetic glyphs, attributes, and anthropomorphic figures would be obfuscated by graphic uniformity. Marks depicting the relative illumination of surfaces can be mistaken for the identical marks depicting material specificity and differ- ential texture, as in a thatched roof.12 Contour line and saturated in-painting were sufficient before external pressures introduced hatching.  In early modern Europe, the mechanical reproduction of pictures made hatching a necessary formal innovation.13 In globally disseminated European woodcuts, ink adhering to the exposed wood had to be directed into discrete units before transference to the paper by the printing press. The displacement 108 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="8"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 109 FIGURE 4. Domenico Ghirlandaio, Servant Girl Pouring Water, 1485–90, pen and brown ink. Uffizi, Gabinetto dei Disegni (inv. 289 E), Florence. of the wood with a chisel produced the reserve of paper at regular intervals. As a result, a system of parallel lines registered the relative tone of differenti- ated surfaces, even if it created ambiguities regarding texture. This important technical innovation and compromise is significant for understanding the processes of cultural convergence in the Florentine Codex.14 The tlacuilo who painted the clouds incorporated hatching into the glyph/contour scheme. The transfer of this formal pattern was indebted to a medium that was central to the colonization and Christianization of New Spain. Woodcuts were prominent features of the catechisms printed in Mexico accompanying transliterations of Nahuatl with Spanish en face translations.15 On the first page of the Doctrina Cristiana en Lengua Española y Mexicana (1548), a woodcut print of a scene of confession and absolution uses hatching to suggest a coordinated, single-source system of lighting (fig. 5).16 Parallel diagonal lines mark shadow to the right of depicted bodies. Hatching coexists with contour. The structural requirements for embossing the surface of the paper with the inked wood relief included the use of contour line.  Clouds and Rain 109 </page> <page sequence="9"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 110 FIGURE 5. “Confession,” Doctrina Cristiana en Lengua Española y Mexicana (1548), woodcut print. Photo: Author. Although hatching was a technical requirement for the mechanical reproduction and dissemination of Christian iconography, it was not neces- sary for the tlacuilo who painted clouds and rain. In the glyphic tradition, hue was adequate to the task of conveying the shape of objects as well as the rela- tive opacity of clouds in the process of precipitation. In “Clouds and Rain,” hatching is made redundant by the use of wash. The painter is largely appro- priating formal features of the monochrome print. As a result, there is a dis- junction between form and the specific local material requirements. Initially, one might argue that the picture is “dematerialized” or becomes “image.” Form seems to be relatively autonomous with regard to material processes in this instance. Indeed, the fluidity of this formal transposition from mechanical print to the handmade picture resembles the migration of iconography through the operations of copying. Yet, the transmission of hatching does not encourage a simple relationship between “Clouds and Rain” and an identifiable “source.” The complex negotiation of the tlacuilo with the visual culture of the conquistador is not restricted to the migration of the “differentiating contour.” The tlacuilo does not simply “borrow” and inscribe a uniform shape. In fact, without the boundaries of contour line, broken parallel lines resist conforming to a uniform shape. So why borrow? Cross-hatching Looking back to “Clouds and Rain,” the reader should be aware that the description of hatching as a system of parallel marks is inadequate to the complexity of the picture. In fact, the disjunction of form and local mate- rial requirements is amplified by the disruption of one system of parallel 110 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="10"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 111 FIGURE 6.

In key passages—inside the contours on the left and most significantly below the cloud bank—we find two perpendicular systems of parallel lines. The cross-hatching is adapted from print technology, but more specifically from engravings or etchings rather than woodcuts.  By the sixteenth century, the production of woodcuts was declining in Europe in part as a result of competition by line-engraving in book illustra- tion.17 The metal plate offered several advantages for the mass production of pictures, including the durability of the plate. However, the problem of controlling ink’s entropic properties is exponentially increased by the appli- cation of ink to a metal plate for the purposes of producing an intaglio print. Cross-hatching of the metal plate, whether through direct engraving or the indirect process of etching, provided channels for the ink to accumulate in a predictable linear pattern (fig. 6). This is in stark contrast to the woodcut’s positive relief impression. The specific technical requirements of printing from a metal plate and the extensive circulation of these prints expanded the audience sufficiently competent to understand cross-hatching. As a result, cross-hatching largely became the presumed notation for tonal varia- tion. This had consequences for the development of visual epistemologies in the process of colonization. I am making a distinction between the migration of the symbol and the appropriation by the tlacuilo of a notational system. Hatching was associated Clouds and Rain 111 </page> <page sequence="11"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 112 with the reproductive technologies required for Christianization and colo- nial administration.18 As a result, the parallel broken lines alien to the glyphic tradition were available forms of cultural authority. The migration of hatching from European prints to the codices of New Spain was not restricted to the transfer of an immaterial iconography. In “Clouds and Rain,” the tlacuilo simulated the pictorial effects of different materials and technologies: glyph, woodcut, and engraving. Pushing the brush simulated the pictorial effects that in the printing process resulted from (1) inscribing the plate; (2) inking the plate; (3) wiping the plate (in the case of engrav- ing); (4) placing the paper over the ink-sodden wood or metal plate; (5) applying a damp cloth blanket; (6) rolling the cylinder; and (7) pulling the sheet.19 Although hatching is not the representation of one thing, it is diffi- cult to dissociate its distinctive formal features from material processes that are deeply invested in the structure of colonization. Hatching is figurative, if not allegorical. As we have seen, hatching was a technological response to a demand to depict the systematic behavior of light in response to objects (one of the cluster of conventions including linear perspective that constituted perva- sive European modes of representation). Unlike Warburg’s symbol as “dif- ferentiating contour” that signifies discontinuity, hatching attends to the contiguity of objects, not their singularity. Hatching offered a world based on the principle of similarity. Objects were treated alike irrespective of their ontological status. Hatching can depict dirt or the angel’s wing, the thun- dercloud or its precipitate. Importantly, for the tlacuilo, the differences between the clouds and the gods were subsumed by the discipline of the imported forms.  Yet, “Clouds and Rain” draws attention to the instability of a notational system premised on the authority of visual perception. Even as a plane or contiguous field of shadow is suggested by the system of lines, the disconti- nuity of the field (the separation of discrete lines) dissociates the inscribed lines from their perceptual referent. Continuity has been substituted by reticulation (the net of lines). There is always a tension between conven- tional representation of shadow through hatching and the perceived behavior of discrepant luminosity. The relative frequency of intervals conventionally conveys relative degrees of opacity, but these discrete inscriptions are predi- cated on the breaking up of the apparently seamless surface of a regular vol- ume. Far from providing a rational grid, the network of lines, which had been designed to respond to the inconstant behavior of substances, hatching has been set adrift from its intended function. The simulation of the mechanical form—whether the result of “misreading” or motivated “mimicry”—results in inadvertent consequences.20 There is a transforma- tion of conceptual value on the level of the signifier rather than the sign.21 112 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="12"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 113 Furthermore, the tlacuilo’s appropriation of cross-hatching from prints ges- tures toward a picture unmoored from optical perception. One of the achievements of this cross-cultural negotiation is the dissociation of cross- hatching from its perceptual referent; in other words, the tlacuilo’s borrow- ing points to the conventionality of the pictorial signifier. Hatching can be said to become a glyph.  Precipitation We return to the beginning. “The Tlalocs are already coming.” If we pause at this phrase accompanying “Clouds and Rain,” the interpretation of the contact between thundercloud and mountain remains ambiguous. The coming of the Tlalocs portends rain or hail, the conditions for subsis- tence or famine, respectively. In “Clouds and Rain,” the tension between these divergent narrative possibilities and their respective historical out- comes is most intensely manifested where the dense wash comes in contact with the highest frequency of cross-hatchings. The rain-bearing Tlalocs, the accumulation of black ink to the point of apparent accidental seepage and inchoate figuration, yields at the edge of the reserve, evaporating. White clouds make hail. Blank paper is a catastrophic event. Nonanthropomorphic form is deeply invested in historical causation and suspended narrative con- sequences. Below, the net of lines relaxes, maintaining their distinctness through the reduction of frequency, the lengthening of each broken line and the extension of intervals across the sheet. The vertical lines commence at the contour line and terminate at different points below, suggesting a downward trajectory. Now it will rain. In “Clouds and Rain,” a technologi- cally expedient and highly conventionalized system of shading, dissociated from material necessity, has been transformed suddenly into the mimetic falling of rain. “Now the masters of the rain will sprinkle water.” The glyph for the deity Tlalocatecutli or any anthropomorphic pictorial attributes is markedly absent. Elsewhere, indigenous artists made pictures of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints in churches where pagan deities per- sisted at the margins, transformed into mere ornament. In the Florentine Codex, however, New World pagan gods had to become unrecognizable. More precisely, for the purposes of ethnographic salvage, Sahagún’s recon- stitution of Mesoamerican idols with a differential contour was too danger- ous. Hatching rather than contour created the sufficient distance between the old gods and the new. But hatching also permitted the survival of the wisdom that it was meant to displace. The metamorphosis of ink into rain might be understood as a site for sustained practice and the persistence of “red ink, black ink.”22 Clouds and Rain 113 </page> <page sequence="13"> REP104_10  10/29/08  12:04  Page 114 Notes Aspects of this essay benefited from participation in the Seeing Across Cultures: Visuality in the Early Modern Period panel at the College Art Association annual meeting (2008) chaired by Jeanette Peterson and Dana Leibsohn.
