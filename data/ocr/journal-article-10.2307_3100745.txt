<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews Art Deco 1910-1939 London by TANYA HARROD IT WAS THE STYLE of the flapper girl and the factory, the ocean liner and the sky- scraper, the fantasy world of Hollywood and the real world of the Harlem Renais- sance.' Art Deco 1910-1939 (at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, to 20oth July)' opens with this nostalgic, threnodic text. We are left in no doubt about the kind of agreeable experience on offer: 'unlike its functionalist sibling, Modernism', Art Deco 'responded to the human need for pleasure and escape'. The crowds currently jostling for space at the V. &amp; A. testify to this imperative. It is an intensely glamorous exhibition which has rightly been widely and enthusiastically reviewed in the press. It also raises all kinds of interesting and, at times, troubling questions about styles and movements. These are worth discussing, not least because the exhibition comes after the Museum's much acclaimed Art Nouveau 1890-1914, held in 2ool1, and will be fol- lowed by major investigations into the Arts and Crafts Movement and the Modemrn Movement opening in March 2005 and in 2006 respectively. Confronted by the selection of eight objects chosen to preface the exhibition, the style seems immediately intelligible. We are introduced to dazzling examples of fash- ion, applied art and quantity production. At first glance a 1925 drop-waisted beaded silk evening dress by Jeanne Paquin incorpo- rating a panel of Chinese silk (Fig.62), an Empire-inspired dressing table veneered in mahogany and amaranth and inlaid with ebony and ivory designed byJacques-Emile Ruhlmann (Fig.63), the sweeping lines of a 1927 railway poster by Cassandre and a streamlined outboard motor designed by John R. Morgan in 1936 appear to share a visual language. But if we put down our cocktail shaker of intuitions what in fact have these iconic exhibits in common? The visual coherence of Art Deco as a style seems quite elusive. We readily supply the connexions, largely through imaginative empathy.2 Sceptics will point out that this is unsur- prising, given that the term Art Deco is a neologism. In that sense it differs from Art Nouveau. The latter did not gain its identi- ty with hindsight. Around 1900oo its various national manifestations - such as stile Liber- ty, stile floreale, Jugendstil, stil' modern and Modernista - were self-consciously being debated, praised and attacked. Art Deco, on the other hand, was a term coined in the I960s by dealers as a short-hand reference to the 1925 Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes. Sub- sequently, cautious historians of design, particularly in France, have confined its descriptive use to the 'conservatively mod- ern' decorative art of the 1920os inspired by 62.

The style was given a historical framework by the discoveries of pioneering dealers and collectors moving on from a disinterment of Art Nouveau. The histories of Pop art and post-modem architecture yield further clues. Among artists, designers and architects a liking for 63. Dressing table, by Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann. 1925.

Art Deco fans such as Andy Warhol and Robert Venturi come to mind. The taste was shaped by a sensibil- ity brilliantly delineated by Susan Sontag in her 1964 essay 'Notes on Camp'. Camp, Sontag observed, is 'neutral with respect to content'6 - which explains why Hillier's survey could include Le Corbusier, Char- lotte Perriand and Edouard Jeanneret's chaise longue, alongside Ruhlmann furni- ture, Berthold Lubetkin's Highpoint One and the Chrysler Building. Ghislaine Wood (the curator of this exhi- bition) and Charlotte and Tim Benton (the co-editors of the accompanying book) tend to follow Hillier's inclusive approach but also introduce some rigour to the analysis of their glittering, evanescent subject. In a carefully argued introductory essay, the Bentons tackle the issue of content in order to differentiate between Art Deco and 'its austere cousin Modernism'.7 (Style investi- gations invariably have a pronounced ten- dency to collapse into anthropomorphic metaphor.) While designers and architects whose aims were 'utopian and emancipa- tory', 'socially engaged' and 'disinterested' were self-evidently Modernists, Art Deco is seen as a decorative eclectic modem style defined by a negative - the lack of a pro- gressive ideology. This creates a rather inflexible binary structure in our minds in which we set a preoccupation with surface (and the employment of motifs like zig- zags, frozen fountains and sunbursts; Fig.66) against a functionalist monolithic Modem- ism concerned only with plan and struc- ture.8 The Bentons also invoke Wittgen- stein's concept of'a family of resemblances' to make sense of Art Deco's variousness. Many visitors to the 1925 Paris Exposition felt that the objects assembled had a 'family resemblance', influenced, as Wal- demar George observed, by 'les principes de corn-position introduits par Pablo Picasso, Georges Braques, et ]uan Gris'. But can that synchronous moment be extended over twenty years? The first part of the exhibition seeks to pin down the style with a section on 'Sources', encompassing influences from ancient Egypt, the Far East, Africa north and south of the Sahara, the classical world, Art Nouveau and eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century applied arts. The com- plex relationships between progressive fine artists, designers and the great couturiers before and after the First World War prove more difficult to convey in a section on the influence of 'The Avant-Garde'.9 Here we require a portable catalogue and the preci- sion of catalogue entries. For instance, what can we make of a maquette of Raymond Duchamp-Villon's faCade for the collabora- tive 'Maison Cubiste' shown at the Salon d'automne of I912? This enigmatic little 462 JUNE 2003 ?

Admittedly, the accom- panying book provides some of the answers but it is far too bulky to carry around the exhibition. The following section, devoted to the 1925 Paris Exposition itself, goes beyond the Art Deco 'problem' to provide a real sense of a particular time and place, previously only guessed at from photographs. The recreation of part of the Grand Salon of Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann's lavish pavilion, H6tel du Collectioneur, with its extraordi- nary juxtaposition of a Brobdingnagian lacquer cabinet (the joint creation of Ruhlmann and Jean Dunand with incised neo-primitive imagery by Jean Lambert- Rucki), the decorative painterJean Dupas's huge, vulgar Les perruches and a selection of lightly elegant chairs and tables also designed by Ruhlmann, is a curatorial tri- umph. It makes manifest a complex artistic 65. Bracelet and brooch, by Raymond Templier. c. 1925-3o. Diamonds set in platinum, bracelet: 5.3 by 5.8 by 6.4 cm.; brooch: 3 by 2 cm.

The gender- ing of objects is taken to extremes in the form of a disturbingly curvaceous chiffonier covered in sharkskin designed by Andre" Groult and an imaginary dead-pan pastiche portrait, L'ambassadrice, by Marie Laurenqin (both for the ambassadress's bedroom) and a cubist-inspired desk designed by Pierre Chareau for the ambassador's library. Art Deco 191o-1939 also retrieves objects that were exhibited in the national pavil- ions, demonstrating the variousness of design around 1925. Sweden, for instance, developed an elegant playful Neo-classi- cism while Fascist Italy mixed Gio Ponti's rather wittier gloss on the ancient world with Fortunato Depero's tapestry Serrada, a sophisticated celebration of folk art and rural life. At this point the information panels might have included the observa- tions of some of the sixteen million visitors to the Exposition. From an English perspec- tive the stars were Ruhlmann, a dramatic glass dining room designed by Rene Lalique, the folkloric Polish pavilion, the Dane Georg Jensen's silver - all part of the Art Deco canon. But there was also praise for the constructivist Soviet Pavilion designed by Konstantin Melnikov and ex- pressive ceramics by another Dane, Jean Gauguin, inspired by Tang figurines. Per- haps understandably the reviewer writing in Artwork found that there was 'little evidence that a distinctive modem style yet exists'." The central part of this exhibition looks at the spread of Art Deco under two head- ings, the Modeme and the Exotic. A large section on the Modeme shows us the style as it moves into the 193os. The highlight is the partial reconstruction of the entrance foyer of the Strand Palace Hotel, rescued by prescient curators at the V. &amp; A. in 1963 (Fig.64). The Modeme also takes in a gen- erous selection of lavish and truly adven- turous jewellery by figures such as Gerard Sandoz, Raymond Templier (Fig.65) and Jean Fouquet and a splendid array of fine book bindings as well as cheap Bakelite ashtrays, Clarice Cliff earthenware (Fig.66) and the ultimate Art Deco 'collectable', Les girls by Dem&amp;tre Chiparus, one of his famous stylised decorative sculptures in bronze and ivory. The Exotic section is less familiar and more interesting. It concerns France ex- clusively, giving a sense of the elegance and exquisite use of materials achieved by individual designers such as Eileen Gray (Fig.67) and Armand Rateau. Andirons and a carved stone fire surround by Jacques Lipchitz are just two of an ensemble of objects that record the exquisite taste of the couturier Jacques Doucet. He also owned Picasso's Les desmoiselles d'Avignon, under- lining that an aspect of the social strategy of figures such as Doucet, Paul Poiret and Andre Groult was to display their knowl- edge of advanced art to their clients.12 All this is focused and good, as is the inclusion of Jean Dunand's mildly eroticised racial portraits, Les peuples d'Asie and Les peuples d'Afrique, made for the 193 I Paris Exposition Coloniale internationale. The snippet of film showing the black American Josephine Baker in full flow re-representing African dance and Dunand's lacquer panels poten- tially open a complicated can of worms in which the French mission civilatrice abuts the francophone African cultural movement known as nigritude. The can stays firmly shut. Overall Art Deco 191o-1939 floats free of political context, although the accompany- ing book includes an essay by Ghislaine Wood which looks at France's colonial r6le and another by Tim Benton which exam- ines the effect of Fascism on design in Italy. But the Art Deco style was easily put to the service of Fascist imagery, as the films of Leni Riefenstahl demonstrate. They are the dark counterpart of the Busby Berke- ley routines shown in the last part of the 66. 'Sunray' vase, by Clarice Cliff for A.H. Wilkinson, Ltd. c.1929-30. Earthenware, I3.3 by 15.4 cm.

Then again, the mechanics of Art Deco's rapid proliferation could be given a firmer grounding. It 'spread like wildfire' for the reason presciently noted by Karl Marx as early as 1848: 'The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country."'3 Brief sections devoted to the Far East and Australia make the point inciden- tally while the lavish decorative interiors commissioned by the Maharajahs of Indore and Surguja for their palaces add a further nuance, objectifying a Faustian bargain made with a colonial power. The exhibition culminates in a democra- cy of American skyscrapers and streamlin- ing. This, the last room of this beautifully designed exhibition, is visually and aurally stunning, filled with the sweet sounds of jazz and animated by flickering cinema screens. But the evolution which the exhi- bition traces seems finally to require us to believe that a carved, gilt and lacquer dressing table, made by Paul Follot in Paris in 1919-20, somehow shares a visual lan- guage with Egmont Arens and Theodore C. Brookhart's aluminium, steel and rubber 'Streamliner' meat slicer, manufactured in Troy, Ohio, in 1941. It is like a conjuring trick - sometimes one gets it and sometimes one does not. The exhibition's accompanying book, containing forty essays, really deserves a review of its own. Some of the texts - for instance the nine on sources and iconogra- phy - could have been synthesised by one acute cultural historian. The contributions by Charlotte and Tim Benton are outstand- ing, as are closely argued essays by Gillian Naylor on Britain and David Crowley on Central Europe. The essays on the style's impact in the Far East, India, Latin Ameri- ca, Australasia and South Africa are all of great interest. The authors belong to a gen- eration of design historians largely trained to avoid style as an analytic category. Some throw caution to the wind and, as it were, get into bed with the style. Others, for instance Tag Gronberg on consumption at the 1925 Paris Exposition, and Wendy Kap- lan on design in the U.S.A. in the 192Os, avoid using the term Art Deco at all, with concomitant benefits. Altogether, this is a serious book which wisely does not push the logic of style analysis too far. But it is not a catalogue. From a great museum like the V. &amp; A. one expects the kind of collab- orative scholarship embodied in catalogue entries. Otherwise an exhibition like this is in danger of appearing more spectacle, offering wonder at the expense of social and historical resonance.
