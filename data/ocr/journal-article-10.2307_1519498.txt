Seemingly minor differences to non-Israelite cultic bread-laying combine to convey a fundamentally different theological statement. The aspects of the "bread of the presence" and its ritual which are unique within the Israelite cult reveal the special significance of this bread. Uniqueness is found in the designations (hap)pdnim, "of the presence," and berzt Coldm, "eternal covenant", and the arrangement of the bread tdmid, "regularly," once a week on the Sabbath. While (hap)pdnim berlt oldm and tdmid emphasize that the deity resides continually with his people, the limitations inherent in the ritual, by contrast with non-Israelite cultic bread-laying, mitigate the anthropomorphism of the theological statement.2 Fur- thermore, there is in the "bread of the presence" ritual (Lev. xxiv 5-9) a positive redefinition of bread-laying by linking the bread to the Sabbath, and thus to creation. It is suggested, therefore, that the bread represents the concept that YHWH is Israel's resident Creator-Provider who, unlike other ancient Near-Eastern deities, acknowledges no dependence upon human food. 1 Thanks are due to M. Weinfeld (Hebrew University, Jerusalem), J. Milgrom (University of California, Berkeley), B. Schwartz (Hebrew University) and G. Hartelius (Loma Linda University at Riverside, California) for their valuable sug- gestions and criticism.

Abrahams, Jerusalem, 1967; 1st edn in Hebrew, Jerusalem, 1951), pp. 336-7, on Exod xxv 23-30 regarding "innovations" in the Israelite "bread of the presence" ritual necessary to make it consistent with Israelite theology and to set it apart from notions implicit in non-Israelite practice.</page><page sequence="2">ROY GANE I. (hap)pdnim, "of the presence", and no prescription for an accompanying libation ritual The bread presented inside the sanctuary and the table on which it is placed are the only Israelite cultic objects referred to as of (hap)pdanm, "of the presence".3 This correlates with the fact that the bread is the only human food offered inside the tent. The absence of a prescription in Lev. xxiv 5-9 for the performance of an accompanying libation is significant, especially so in the light of non-Israelite practice. (1) pdnim usually refers to the face of an animate being or to the front part of an object as perceived in the line of vision, but it may also signify the "presence" or "person" of a human being (2 Sam. xvii 11: Absalom) or of God (Exod. xxxiii 14, 15; Deut. iv 37; cf. Isa. lxiii 9: "the angel of his presence").4 The simplest interpreta- tion of (hap)pdnim as used with the bread is that it refers to a location with respect to the divine presence residing above the ark behind the paroket-veil.5 The following evidence supports this as the correct view. (a) The fact that the table as well as the bread is of happdnim (Num. iv 7) suggests that the term has to do with location rather than with a physical characteristic of the loaves, such as their appearance.6 3 lehem pdnim: Exod. xxv 30; lehem happdnim: Exod. xxxv 13, xxxix 36; 1 Sam. xxi 7; 1 Kgs vii 48; 2 Chron. iv 19. Elsewhere, the bread is referred to by its other attributes: "holy" (1 Sam. xxi 5), "regular" (Num. iv 7) and combinations using the terms macareket, "ordering" (Neh. x 34; 1 Chron. ix 32; 2 Chron. ii 3, etc.) or Yerek, "order" (Exod. xl 4, 23). In Lev. xxiv 7, the bread is called simply lehem. The table is described as of happdnim in Num. iv 7. 4 But see the LXX of Isa. lxiii 9: "Not a messenger or an angel-his presence (pdndw) saved them." 5 For other interpretations, see Encyclopaedia Biblica (Hebrew) IV Jerusalem, 1962), col. 493, and P.A.H. de Boer, "An Aspect of Sacrifice", in Studies in the Religion of Ancient Israel (SVT 23, 1972), pp. 32-6. 6 If (hap)pdnim with reference to the table were due simply to its association with the bread, we would expect sulhan lehem happdnim, "the table of the bread of the presence", in Num. iv 7 rather than sulhan happdnim, "the table of the presence". It could be argued, of course, that sulhan happdnim is an abbreviation for sulhan lehem happdnim. In support of this idea is the fact that the lamp and altar of incense are not described as happdnim in spite of their proximity to the ark. Therefore, the use of happanim with the table would be derived from its association with the bread. If this is correct, Num. iv 7 is invalidated as special evidence for the meaning of (hap)panim. 180</page><page sequence="3">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE (b) Exod. xxv 30 is the first mention of the bread: "And you shall set bread7 of the presence (lehem pdnim) before me (lepdnay, lit. "at my face") regularly." The proximity of pdnim to lepdnay here implies that the meaning of "bread of the presence" has to do with the fact that it is placed before the presence of YHWH. The verse emphasizes the theocentric nature of the cult: Rituals are per- formed with reference to YHWH. This agrees with the typology of ancient temple cults in general. As we shall see below, non-Israelite cultic bread-laying was also performed in a theocentric setting. The Akkadian use of the prepositional phrase ana pan, "toward (the face of)", in the context of bread offerings to divinities shows ritual action to be performed with reference to the deity (CAD 1/I, p. 244, under akalu, "bread"). (c) At first glance, it would seem that in Exod. xxv 30, pdnim is simply used as the adjectival equivalent of lepdnay or its third- person counterpart, lipne yhwh, "before YHWH".8 In sanc- tuary/temple contexts, lipneyhwh is a term of location defined with reference to the deity but not specifying distance from the divine presence within the holy precincts9 However, while the objects designated as of (hap)pdnim are also lipneiyhwh (cf. Exod. xl 23; Lev. xxiv 6,8), it is by no means true that all cultic objects which are lipne yhwh are also of (hap)pdnim. For example, the offerings brought to the outer altar and presented lipne[yhwh (Lev. i 3, iii 1, etc.) are called simply the lehem, "food" of God (Lev. xxi 8, 17, 21, 22, xxii 25; cf. Num. xxviii 2). Since the difference between lehem here and lehem pdnim, "bread of the presence", is relative proximity to the deity, pdnim must emphasize closeness to YHWH. In other words, both the inner bread and the outer offerings are lehem and lipne[yhwh 7 Note the absence of the definite article. 8 The syntactic difference between pdnim and lepanay/lipneyhwh is demonstrated by other passages. Where sanctuary objects are simply listed, lehem is qualified by happdnim: Exod. xxxv 13, xxxix 36; 1 Kgs vii 48; 2 Chron. iv 19. lipneyhwh appears without happdnim in Exod. xl 23 and Lev. xxiv 6, 8 where the actual placement of the bread is in view. The difference is between adjectival (defining lehem) and adverbial (defining location) usage. Exod. xxv 30 uses both pdnim and lepanay because the bread is introduced into the inventory of prescribed cultic objects and the location of placement is specified as well. Thus, while there is an element of tautology in the juxtaposition of the two words here, this is not a valid objection against rendering pdnim as "presence" (against de Boer, p. 34). 9 See M. Haran, Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel (Oxford, 1978; reprinted Winona Lake, Indiana, 1985), p. 26, n. 24. 181</page><page sequence="4">ROY GANE but only the bread presented inside the tent is also panim. The special "bread of the presence" belongs to the inner, more intimate sphere of the theocentric cult. The fact that Ezekiel and Malachi referred to sacrificial altars as tables (Ezek. xliv 15-16; Mal. i 7, 12)10 shows that they recognized their function as places where God would receive his lehem, "food". In the tabernacle, there is a correspondence between the altar and the table inside the tent.1l However, while lehem is placed upon both "tables", there are important differences in ritual context and treatment. Unlike the outer altar, the inner table functions within a complex of ritual loci corresponding to elements of a human dwelling (see below). Furthermore, whereas the outer sacrifices ascend to YHWH in the form of smoke, the orientation of the inner bread is horizontal-toward the divine presence behind the veil. While there is a horizontal aspect to the sacrifices in that they are performed lipneyhwh, "before YHWH", the bread is much more intimately associated with the resident divine presence. Therefore, the setting and use of the "bread of presence" associates far more anthropomorphism with it than with the sacrifices at the outer altar. The bread cannot be understood as an isolated element in the ritual of the tabernacle. The table on which it is placed, the lamp- stand and the incense burner must be taken together as the fur- niture of the dwelling of God. After all, the purpose of the sanc- tuary is to provide a place for YHWH to dwell among his people (Exod. xxv 8).12 The complex of rituals performed by the priest in the holy place, such as tending the lamp (Exod. xxvii 20-1; Lev. xxiv 1-4), and burning the incense (Exod. xxx 7, 8) constitutes the 10 That sulhani, "my table", in Ezek. xliv 16 is the outer altar is shown by the use of qrb and srt, paralleling the language of the previous verse, where fat and blood are specifically mentioned. While qrb is used elsewhere with respect to the outer altar (see R. Gane and J. Milgrom, "qrb", TWAT VII, cols 150, 154-5), it never appears in connection with the golden table or the "bread of the presence". 1 See also Ezek. xli 22, where a table made of wood and standing "before YHWH" in the temple is called an altar. According to W. Zimmerli (Ezechiel [Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1969], pp. 1051-2; Ezekiel II [E. tr. by J. Martin, Philadelphia, 1983], p. 389), this table corresponds to that on which the "bread of the presence" was offered. 12 Cf. the term for the tabernacle itself: miskdn, "dwelling-place". 182</page><page sequence="5">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE work of a servant for his Lord, enthroned behind the veil in the holy-of-holies.13 Since the bread is the only food (not including drink) offering placed inside the tabernacle and said to be of (hap)pdnim, the ritual use of this bread is crucial to the question where YHWH stands with regard to human food. We will analyse the bread ritual with this issue in mind following a treatment of libations and com- parative material. (2) The singularity of the bread is heightened by the fact that its ritual seems to lack an accompanying libation. While the logical place for specifying such a drink offering would be Lev. xxiv 5-9, the only passage describing in detail what is to be done with the bread, no libation is mentioned there. Elsewhere, there are apparent contradictions regarding the possibility of drink offerings connected with the golden table, as shown by the following discussion. The strongest evidence for such libations is the existence of golden vessels which are placd on the table (Cal-hassulhadn Exod. xxxvii 16). Exod. xxv 29 orders the manufacture of four kinds of these vessels.14 At least the last two kinds (qefdwot and menaqqiyyot) must be libation vessels, because the parallel in Exod. xxxvii 16 reverses their order immediately preceding the clause, 'aseryussak bdhen, "into which shall be poured" (see Cassuto, p. 339, on Exod. xxv 29). The same two kinds appear in Num. iv 7, where they are said to be "of the drink offering" (hannasek). On the other hand, Exod. xxx 9 prohibits the pouring of libations on the inner altar, the most obvious function for the golden vessels kept on the table. So how are the vessels used? Some attempted answers are as follows: (a) According to the rabbis, during the second temple period the vessels were used for wine libations at the outer altar (Tos. Zeb. I 12). This practice avoids a collision between the libatory function of the vessels and Exod. xxx 9. However, since they are made of 13 See Haran, pp. 216-19; M. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford, 1972), pp. 191-2. 14 The depiction on the arch of Titus of a table taken from the second temple shows a vessel on top of the table. A picture of this scene is provided in the article "Bread of the Presence", IDB, I, p. 464. Whether or not the table is that of the "bread of the presence" remains uncertain (de Boer, p. 29). 183</page><page sequence="6">ROY GANE gold and pertain to the table, the libation vessels belong to the special sphere of service inside the tent.15 They must be distin- guished from vessels intended for wine libations at the outer altar (Num. xv 5, 7, 10), for the vessels used there were of bronze (Exod. xxvii 3, xxxviii 3).16 Using the golden vessels outside the tent would be unnecessary and incompatible with the otherwise consistent restriction of gold to the inside of the tent (see n. 15). (b) It could be suggested that the meaning of the verb yussak in Exod. xxv 29 and xxxvii 16 parallels the use of Aramaic verbs of the same root (nsk) in connection with offerings in general (Dan. ii 46) and with bread (Sefire III 5, 7).17 Thus, the vessels could con- tain "bread of presence" rather than drinks. However, this general meaning of the verb nsk is unattested in Biblical Hebrew. Further- more, in defining the vessels, Num. iv 7 provides us with the noun of the same root (hanndsek&lt;nesek). There is no evidence that this noun could refer to a bread rather than drink offering. (c) Could the clause 'aseryussak bdhen in Exod. xxv 29 and xxxvii 16 as well as qes6t hanndsek, "the jugs of the drink offering", in Num. iv 7 simply refer to the vessels being fashioned like libation vessels, 18 although from the time of their manufacture they are never meant to be used? In other words, could they be fossilized in nature from the beginning? Probably not. The verbyussak suggests that the vessels are to be employed for the performance of ritual action. There are no examples elsewhere in the Israelite cult of non- functional utensils (pointed out to me by J. Milgrom). (d) Haran (pp. 216-17) and Milgrom (Numbers, p. 240) have interpreted the evidence to suggest that originally a drink offering may have been performed inside the tent, but later the vessels on the table served merely as a vestigial reminder of such a libation, perhaps containing a beverage which remained on the table until its consumption, along with the bread, by the priests. Important for Milgrom is Num. xxviii 7b, which prescribes a unique drink offer- 15 See Haran, pp. 163-5, on the material gradation of the sanctuary: gold was used inside the tent. 16 J. Milgrom, Numbers (Philadelphia, 1990), p.26. 17 Brought to my attention by Weinfeld. See Weinfeld, Deuteronomy, pp. 99, n. 4, 192. 18 See the Jerusalem Bible rendering in Exod. xxv 29 and xxxvii 16: simply "liba- tion bowls". 184</page><page sequence="7">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE ing of sekdr, a kind of beverage,19 to be offered baqqodes, "in the sanctuary", which he takes to mean "inside the tent": Perhaps this half verse and the cited verses dealing with the golden libation bowls are vestiges of an original libation on the inner altar, one that was later forbidden as a gross anthropomorphism, lest one think that the Deity-in his private chambers-actually imbibed the liquid. The libation, then, would have been set on the table of display together with its loaves of bread (Numbers, p. 240). Note Milgrom's view of Exod. xxx 9 here: the prohibition may have been enacted later for theological reasons. He sees in the necessity for such a specific proscription evidence for the original performance of libations on the inner altar (private communi- cation). Milgrom recognizes that, if the sekdr libation of Num. xxviii 7b is to be identified with such a vestige of a drink offering inside the tent using the golden vessels, the two halves of Num xxviii 7 must refer to two different libations, the first a wine offering on the outer altar and the second a sekdr libation inside the sanctuary (Numbers, p. 240). This raises a question: would the sekdr libation be per- formed daily in conjunction with a wine offering at the outer altar? If so, the sekdr libation could not be an accompaniment to the bread ritual, which is performed weekly. If, on the other hand, the sekdr is changed weekly along with the bread (however, see below), why is it mentioned in Num. xxviii 7b? The only answer that comes to mind is that Num. xxviii 7b could specify merely a contrast between the nature of libations to be offered inside versus outside the tent: whereas wine is used outside, the unique sekdr is reserved for use inside. I must comment briefly on the meaning of baqqodes. Since Num. xxviii 7b is one of the more ambiguous instances, it is helpful to compare some clearer cases. Aside from poetic passages (Exod. xv 11; various Psalms), the term always refers to location in the 19 Distinguished from ordinary wine (see Milgrom, Numbers, p. 240). The Akk. cognate sikdru is "beer" (see AHW III, p. 1232), which appears, e.g., in daily sacrifices at Uruk (ANET, p. 343). Syr. Pekarlsakrd is "strong drink other than wine, esp. a liquor made from dates or from honey" (J. Payne Smith, A Compen- dious Syriac Dictionary [Oxford, 1903], p. 577), i.e., made from sweet food: cp. Syr. sakar/sakrd, "sugar" (ibid.). Note that Lev ii 11 prohibits an offering of honey on the outer altar. 185</page><page sequence="8">ROY GANE Israelite sanctuary/temple, i.e. in the sacred area where the priests officiate, whether inside the tent/building (Exod. xxix 30; Lev. vi 23, xvi 17, 27; Num. iv 12),2? in a court (Lev. x 18 [cp. vi 19]; Ezek. xliv 27; 2 Chron. xxxv 5)21 or both (Exod. xxxv 19, xxxix 41;22 2 Chron. xxix 7).23 Thus, baqqodes in Num xxviii 7b means "in the sanctuary", but in which sphere? The context here indicates "inside the tent". It is not necessary to designate the loca- tion of the wine libation accompanying the regular burnt offering (vs. 7a). Since the animal sacrifice takes place in the court at the outer altar, its libation is clearly performed in the same place. If the sekdr libation were performed in the same ritual sphere as the wine offering, there would be no good reason for the specification baq- qoded to appear. Thus, baqqodes should refer to a different sphere, namely, inside the tent. (e) It is generally assumed that the preposition beth in as'eryussak bdhen (Exod xxv 29, xxxvii 16) has instrumental force, i.e. "with which to" pour/offer libations.24 What is meant according to this view is that the act of libation is constituted by the pouring out of 20 In Num. iv 12, the vessels for serving baqqodes are specifically those having to do with the inner altar. Treated separately are the utensils with the golden table (vs. 7), the lamp (vss 9-10) and the outer altar (vs. 14). 21 In addition to these passages, if the Massoretic punctuation of Exod. xxviii 43 is followed, baqqodes there refers to the court: "when they enter the tent of meeting, or when they approach the altar to serve baqqode". Alternatively, the verse could be punctuated: "when they enter the tent of meeting or when they approach the altar, to serve baqqodes"'. In this case, baqqodes signifies the sanctuary as a whole, including both ritual spheres. 22 Note that in Exod. xxxv 19 and its parallel in xxxix 41, the Massoretic punc- tuation indicates that the vestments for serving baqqodes include those belonging to Aaron and to his sons. Even if the vestments for serving baqqodes were to be iden- tified with those of Aaron alone (understanding the first part of the verses ending with baqqodes to be in apposition to "the holy vestments belonging to Aaron the priest"), baqqodes must include the court as well as the tent because the high priest officiates in both locations. Exod. xxxix 1, not listed above because it is less than clear, is similar to the two verses just mentioned, but with two differences. First, only two items are mentioned: the vestments for serving baqqodes and the holy vestments of Aaron. There is no explicit mention of vestments belonging to Aaron's sons. Second, the verb Cih, "to do", governs both items separately. Thus, it appears that the vestments for serving baqqodes are in this instance only those of the ordinary priests, who serve in the court. 23 On the plastic nature of baqqodes, see Haran, p. 172, n. 50, andJ. Milgrom, Studies in Levitical Terminology (Berkeley, 1970) I, p. 39, n. 149. 24 See e.g., the Revised Standard Version, new Jewish Publication Society transla- tion and Cassuto, p. 339, on Exod. xxv 29. Cf. the New International Version: "for the pouring out". 186</page><page sequence="9">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE liquid from the golden vessels.25 As we have seen, this interpreta- tion is beset with the problem of where such a drink offering would be poured out if not on the altar of incense. I suggest that the above-mentioned beth, which occurs only in Exod. xxv 29 and xxxvii 16 with nsk + vessels, is not instrumental at all and should be rendered "into", i.e. "into which shall be poured out". Compare Ezek. xxiv 3, where the preposition beth with a verb of pouring (here ysq) and a vessel refers to pouring water "into" the vessel. Thus, the libatory act is that of pouring a libation (see Num. iv 7) of sekdr (Num. xxviii 7b) into the golden vessels, whereupon the vessels with their contents simply remain upon the table until the time comes to replace them with fresh drink.26 This would parallel the presentation type bread offering, which is simply placed/arranged (sym, Lev. xxiv 6; Crk, vs. 8) on the table until it is changed on the next Sabbath (vs. 8). Some questions remain. If the libation inside the tent is a presen- tation offering like the bread, why is it not mentioned in Lev. xxiv 5-9? Does this passage suppress the drink offering for some reason? A better possibility is suggested by the context in which the sekdr offering appears in Num. xxviii 7b: alongside the wine libations performed daily as accompaniments to the regular morning and evening burnt offerings (vss. 7a, 8b). Perhaps the sekdr libation could be performed when the priest enters the tent morning and evening to burn incense on the inner altar (Exod. xxx 7-8). The sequence in which the morning and evening ritual events occur is suggested by the order of mention in Num. xviii 4-7: burnt offering lamb, accompanying cereal offering, accompanying outer wine libation, inner sekdr libation. The simplest solution for the place- ment of the incense offering, not mentioned in this passage, is after the inner libation.27 This order would necessitate only one entrance into the tent. 25 This idea is explicit in the New English Bible: "from which drink-offerings". 26 Cp. drinks presented daily in golden vessels to the gods of the Mesopotamian city of Uruk", ANET, p. 343. 27 M. Yoma III 5 states that the morning incense was offered between (tossing) the blood and (burning) the parts (of the lamb). The evening incense came between the parts and the libations, i.e., libations at the outer altar (see, e.g. Tos. Zeb. I: 12). In this scheme, the incense offering and libations are juxtaposed only in the evening, with the incense preceding the libations. According to Philo (Laws 1 ?171), the burning of the incense was the first ritual in the morning and the last in the evening. Assuming that the libations follow the burnt offering, Philo, like 187</page><page sequence="10">ROY GANE No wonder it would be necessary to prohibit libations on the inner altar! Analogy with the treatment of the outer wine libation would suggest that the inner sekdr, offered about the same time as the burning (of incense) on the inner altar, should be offered on that altar. However, once the sekdr is poured into (nsk b...) the vessels on the table, it is not, according to Exod. xxx 9, then to be poured on (nsk 'al...) the inner altar. Note that the two preposi- tions, Cal and b, characterize the difference between the usual kind of drink offering which is poured on an altar and the unique presen- tation type libation inside the tent. The idea that the sekdr libation is not performed at the same time as the "bread of the presence" offering (once per week) would explain why the former does not appear in Lev. xxiv 5-9: Although the drink may be placed on the table where the bread is located, the two rituals would be discrete. The libation would not serve as an accompaniment to the "bread of the presence" within the bread offering ritual. If the ekdr libation is a presentation offering involving the golden table on which the bread is placed, why would its ritual not be per- formed as an accompaniment to the bread ritual? Three answers come to mind: first, daily performance in the morning would create a strong link between the offerings at the outer altar and the ritual sphere inside the tent. Second, we shall see below that in the light of ubiquitous ancient Near-Eastern practice it is not the daily per- formance of the libation which must be explained, but the weekly placement of the bread. Third, it may be that the chemical nature of sekdr makes it necessary to change it more often than bread in order to keep it from going bad, i.e. before fermentation develops beyond a certain point.28 Are the priests permitted to drink the sekdr just as they are allowed to eat the bread (Lev. xxiv 9)? Probably not. If they were given the drink, we would expect that this would be stated, perhaps the Mishnah, would allow for the juxtaposition of libations with the incense only in the evening. However, Philo would have the evening incense follow the liba- tions as in our outline above. 28 Note the prohibition of leavening agents in offerings on the outer altar: Lev. ii 11. I do not suggest that the bread, probably unleavened like the cereal offerings offered on the outer altar, would remain fresh, but that its staleness (see de Boer, pp. 27-8) would be relatively less serious in a given period of time than the deterioration of the sekdr. 188</page><page sequence="11">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE in Num. xxviii 7b. Furthermore, although incense may be offered on the inner altar at the time when the drink is poured into the golden vessels, the drink and incense do not comprise an offering unit as do the bread and incense placed with it (Lev. xxiv 7) com- prising the "bread of the presence" offering. Therefore, if the priests drink the libation, this act could be regarded as secondary use after consumption by the deity, a theological statement which the "bread of the presence" ritual specifically avoids (see below). What, then, happens to the drink when it is replaced? It may be assumed that the officiant replacing the old drink would dispose of it in some manner. Examples of other ritual items whose disposal must be assumed are: the body of the bird killed on the first day of a healed leper's purification (Lev. xiv 5-6), and the remainder of the hattadt bloods manipulated on the Day of Atonement (Lev. xvi 18-19; cp. Lev. iv 7, 18).29 Having seen my interpretation, Milgrom now suggests that the textual evidence and lack of it on some such points may reflect three historical stages in which the ritual was moved away from anthropomorphism: (i) libation were poured on the inner altar; (ii) libations were presented on the table; (iii) empty libation vessels remained on the table. To conclude our treatment of libations, there are no definitive solutions, synchronic or diachronic, to the problem of how the liba- tion vessels on the table were meant to be used. However, what is significant for us here is the virtual certainty that the vessels were not used for a weekly libation functioning as a ritual accompani- ment to the "bread of the presence". Thus far, my discussion of (hap)panim, "of the presence", has led to the conclusion that the designation emphasizes an anthropomor- phic aspect of the cult: The tabernacle as the dwelling-place of YHWH. This anthropomorphism is strengthened by the fact that there are libation vessels as well as bread on the table, which appears fully set for a meal. We expect Lev. xxiv 5-9 to inform us that the vessels are to be used once per week for a libation accompa- nying the "bread of the presence" offering. That this is not the case appears to be in harmony with the tendency to avoid gross anthropomorphism implicit in Exod. xxx 9, prohibiting libations 29 Cp. Lev. iv 11-12, 21, xvi 27, specifying the manner in which disposal of remaining portions of ha.ttadt offering animals should be carried out. 189</page><page sequence="12">ROY GANE on the inner altar.30 The importance of this de-emphasis of anthropomorphism is clarified by comparison with analogous non- Israelite rites, to which we now turn. (3) Ritual bread-laying was an early custom, appearing, for example, in a Sumerian inscription of Urukagina of Lagas,31 whom J.S. Cooper places a little before 2350 B.C.32 The regular,33 daily placing of bread on tables or stands before the various deities in their temples is attested among the Egyptians and Hittites as well as the Babylonians. This practice was part of the daily care and feeding of the gods, which were symbolized by their idols.34 Oppenheim describes food consumption by Mesopotamian deities: Food was placed in front of the image, which was apparently assumed to consume it by merely looking at it, and beverages were poured out before it for the same purpose. A variant of this pattern consisted of presenting the offered food with a solemn ritual gesture, passing it in a swinging motion before the staring eyes of the image ([n. 34] pp. 191-2). In Hittite cult, consumption could be symbolized by the act of breaking the offered bread (Hoffner [n. 34], p. 217). In addition to being served food and drink, idols were washed, clothed and even provided with make-up paint (Egypt).35 Thus, the ritual statement was highly anthropomorphic.

But now, because the land of Hatti has been acutely oppressed by the plague, these people are dying. If he does not take from us the plague, they will continue to die. These offerers of bread and pourers of libations, who have become established, will die, and no one will any longer make offerings of bread or liba- tions to you! (Hoffner, p. 216). This attempt at persuasion is clearly based upon the notion that the gods suffer if they do not have human servants to help provide their needs. In the old Babylonian epic Atrabasis, when the flood annihilates the population, the gods die from hunger and thirst. Thus, when Atrabasis offers his sacrifice after the flood, the gods smell the offering and crowd around like flies.36 While deities were viewed as needing that which human beings provided, human beings were at the same time dependent upon the gods. This symbiotic relationship is illustrated by paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Anatolian myth of Illuyanka. The passage concerns the purulli-festival, the sequence of events being as follows: a messenger left the city of Nerik, asking the divine mountain Zaliyanu for rain for Nerik. The messenger returned to Nerik. Zaliyanu granted rain. In thanksgiving, the same messenger left Nerik with harsi-bread for Zaliyanu.37 Ritual bread-laying, whether Israelite or non-Israelite, plays an important role in personal service for resident deities. However, whereas bread is accompanied by drinks in the wining and dining of non-Israelite deities inside their temples, a possible libation inside the Israelite cultic tent is not performed as an accompani- ment to the bread placed there. This apparent avoidance of anthropomorphism would not be particularly significant as an 36 Atrabasis III v 30-6. For translit. and trans., see W.G. Lambert and A.R.

II. berit odldm, "eternal covenant", and no consumption by YHWH The "bread of the presence" is the only offering designated as berit oldm, "an eternal covenant" (Lev. xxiv 8).38 Thus, it uniquely symbolizes the relationship itself between YHWH and his people, not serving merely as an instrument of that relationship.39 The bread-offering has in common with some sacrifices the fact that its ritual involves a three-party transaction between YHWH, people and priests. Analysis of this transaction shows a negation of expected ritual meaning, namely, consumption of the bread by YHWH. (1) Since every other instance of the phrase bernt Coldm involves a covenant with God40 and since the offering is presented to him, we must assume that in Lev. xxiv 8 he is one party to this covenant. For the other party, we are left with two possibilities: the priests (cp. Num. xviii 19), and the Israelites as a whole. The words me'et bene-yisrdael, "on behalf of (lit. "from with") the Israelites", immediately preceding berit (oldm make it clear that the Israelites provide the offering as the second party to the covenant, just as they bring the pure oil for the lamp (vs. 2). It is this emphasis upon a regular duty of the people which at least partially explains the place- ment of these two short sections on the oil for the lamp (Lev. xxiv 1-4) and the bread (vss 5-9) in the "Holiness" section of Leviticus.41 38 Closest to this usage is the term berft melah Cdldm, "eternal covenant of salt in Num. xviii 19 with regard to portions of offerings designated by YHWH for the priests. On the meaning of bertt melah, see M. Weinfeld, "berit", TWAT I, col. 791; E. tr. TDOT. II, p. 263. 39 The bulls in the covenant sacrifice (Exod. xxiv 5) are an example of a cove- nant instrument. 40 Gen. ix 16; xvii 7, 13, 19; Exod. xxxi 16; 2 Sam. xxiii 5; Isa. xxiv 5, etc. Cf. Num. xviii 19, xxv 13. 41 Note the order of holy objects within Lev. xix-xxiv: persons (including laity: xix-xx; priests: xxi-xxii 16), sacrifices offered at the outer altar (xxii 17-33), time (xxiii), the holy oil and bread presented inside the shrine (xxiv 1-9), and finally, the divine Name (xxiv 10-23). There are indications here of an ascending progres- sion of holiness, corresponding to proximity to the deity: laity &gt; priests; sacrifices in the court&gt; oil and bread in the outer apartment of the tent&gt; the Name of YHWH who resides above the ark in the inner apartment. 192</page><page sequence="15">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE Two factors in Lev. xxiv 5-9 strengthen the idea of "covenant": (a) The number 12. There are 12 loaves on the table, arranged in two groups of six each (vss 5-6). The number 12 is elsewhere associated with the tribes of Israel (Exod. xxiv 4, xxviii 21; Josh. iv 1ff.; 1 Kgs xviii 31, etc.).42 A division of 12 into two groups appears in Exod. xxviii 9-12, directing that two onyx stones be placed on the shoulder-pieces of Aaron's 'epod, which he is to wear while ministering inside the tent. The names of six tribes of Israel are engraved on one stone and six on the other. Another division of the 12 tribes into two groups appears in Deut. xxvii 1 lff., where the Israelites are commanded to separate themselves physically into two groups of six tribes each for the covenant blessings and curses. To return to Lev. xxiv, it is clear that 12 implies the tribes of Israel, the human party to the covenant.43 (b) Verbs. The verbs used with the arrangements (ma'crdkot, vs. 6) of bread and the incense which is put on it: swm/sym, "place" (vs. 6), ntn, "put" (vs. 7), and 'rk, "arrange" (vs. 8), appear else- where with berit: swm, 2 Sam. xxiii 5; ntn, Gen. xvii 2; Num. xxv 12; and crk, 2 Sam. xxiii 5. Thus, it appears that there is more to the close connection in Lev. xxiv between the concept of covenant and cultic arrangement than mere coincidence. Such a connection is even stronger in Akkadian, where the phrase riksa rakdsu, employ- ing the cognate accusative,44 may refer to arranging a covenant or to arranging cultic or military arrangements.45 In what sense does the bread constitute a berit, "covenant"? Note the similarity in terminology between the passage on the bread (vss 5-9) and the preceding section (vss 1-4) on the oil for the lamp which the priest is to arrange (crk) regularly (tdmid) before 42 Note in Judg. xxi 17 the inviolability of the full number of tribes. 43 In Babylonian cult, the laying out of loaves in multiples of 12 also played a special role, as pointed out by H. Zimmern, Beitrdge zur Kenntnis der babylonischen Religion (Leipzig, 1901), pp. 94-5. The number in this context apparently carried an astral significance to the Babylonians. Philo interpreted the Israelite "bread of the presence" in a similar manner (The Special Laws I ?172). 44 Note that in Lev. xxiv, mac?rdkot is not treated as .the cognate accusative of the verb crk. While the ma'ardkot of bread are included in what is arranged by the priest, the antecedent of the object suffix in yaCarekennu (vs. 8) is 'isseh (vs. 7), which includes not only the bread, but also the incense. 45 Weinfeld "hbryt and hhsd-'Bond and Grace'-Covenantal Expressions in the Bible and in the Ancient World" (Hebrew) Lesonenu 36 (1971-2), p. 104.

The fact that bert Coldm in vs. 8 parallels huqqat Coldm in vs. 3 accords with Weinfeld's conclusion that the original meaning of Hebrew berlt is the idea of "imposition", "liability", or obligation".46 Both huqqat Coldm and berit oladm here involve covenant obligations to be per- formed by Israel for YHWH. hoq--oldm in vs. 9 is a different matter. Although at first glance it appears to parallel huqqat Coldm and berit Colam,47 its context (vs. 9) concerns the right of the priests to eat the bread. Consequently, hoq-coldm must here be rendered "perpetual due" in harmony with normal usage in texts dealing with priestly matters. Other instances of hoq-Coldm referring to the prescribed due of the priests from the offerings are: Exod. xxix 28; Lev. vi 11, vii 34, x 13-15; Num. xviii 8, 11, 19. Returning to the meaning of the bread as bert, while we have found that a covenant obligation is involved, we shall see below that the bread also signifies the special relationship between the Creator and his people in whose midst he dwells. (2) Since YHWH appropriates his lehem which is burned on the outer altar (Lev. xxi, xxii; Num. xxviii) and since other deities enjoy daily quasi-human feasts inside their temples, we expect the "bread of the presence" to be symbolically "eaten" by YHWH. As recognized by Cassuto, this type of consumption would far more likely lead to excessively anthropomorphic conceptions about God than would the burning of sacrifices on the outer altar (p. 337 on Exod. xxv 23-30). Human beings do not take in food as smoke, but they do eat food placed upon tables. Even if fresh bread were merely placed on the table daily, the atmosphere possibly enhanced by the burning of incense at the time of placement, we could conclude that consumption by YHWH is assumed. The dwelling-like setting is conducive to such an assump- tion by default. This assessment would not be altered by the eating of the bread by the priests (Lev. xxiv 9), which could be viewed as secondary use following consumption by YHWH. An example of non-Israelite priests eating food understood to have been appropriated by a deity is found in the Hittite Instructions for Tem- ple Officials. In the context of sacred food offered on festivals, it is required that every part of the sacrificial loaves and libations of beer 46 TWAT I, col. 784= TDOT, II, p. 255. 47 Cp. Ps. 1 16, cv 10, where hoq, "statute", parallels berit/bertt Coldm. 194</page><page sequence="17">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE and wine be devoted to the god. After the ritual function of the food has been completed, the priests are permitted to eat it in the tem- ple.48 The fact that the food remains to be eaten after it is consumed by the deity shows that the god does not consume it in a human manner. An interpretation of the "bread of the presence" opposing the one just given must be based upon an actual denial of YHWH's consumption in the process of the ritual. Such a denial is, in fact, present. As we shall see, in the three-party transaction between YHWH, people and priests (Lev. xxiv 8-9), YHWH appropriates for himself only the incense, which is part of the "bread of the presence" offering. Furthermore, this is the week-old incense included in the week-old bread offering. The close association of the incense with the bread requires that the fate of the old incense must be connected to that of the old bread. YHWH enjoys his incense at the time when the priests are entitled to eat the bread which belongs to the same offering unit. (a) Lev. xxiv 8 indicates that the bread offering is provided by the people, on their behalf.49 According to vs. 7, incense accom- panies the bread as an 'azkdrd. We may establish that this incense is also provided by the Israelites as part of the "bread of the presence" offering. In vs. 8, the priest arranges (yacarekennu) on the table that which is from the people. The antecedent of the object suffix in yaCarekennu, "he shall arrange it", is 'isseh (vs. 7). Since isYseh, "gift",50 in the formula Wisseh lyhwh, "it is a gift belonging 48 ANET, p. 208; E.H. Sturtevant and G. Bechtel, A Hittite Chrestomathy (Philadelphia, 1935), pp. 150-3. 49 We know from Exod. xxxix 36 that the Israelites (see vss. 32, 33) did bring the bread. 1 Chron. ix 32 indicates that in later times some of the Kohathites bore the responsibility of preparing the bread sabbat sabbdt, "sabbathly", i.e. for arrangement every sabbath. This probably had something to do with the stipula- tion in Num. iv 4ff. that the Kohathites had charge of the most holy things when it came to moving the tabernacle. Among these things were the table and the bread (vs. 7). In any case, the Kohathites were not priests, and it is stated only in 1 Chronicles that they prepared the bread. The material itself may have come from non-Levites. 50 Following J. Hoftijzer, "Das sogenannte Feueropfer", SVT 16 (1967), pp. 114-34, and G.R. Driver, "Ugaritic and Hebrew Words", Ugaritica 6 (1969), pp. 181-4. They cite instances where 'isfeh cannot be interpreted as "fire-offering", the traditional rendering, e.g. 1 Sam. ii 28; Deut. xviii 1 and Josh. xiii 14, and find that Ugaritic itt, "generous gift", suggests a much more plausible meaning for Heb. 'isseh: "Rich fare, choicest offering". Thus, in Lev. xxiv 7 it is not 'isseh which informs us that the incense must be burned, but rather 'azkard. 195</page><page sequence="18">ROY GANE to YHWH", (vs. 7) is a summarizing label for the offering as a whole, comprised of bread and incense together,51 we must con- clude that the Israelites are to provide both elements of the offering unit. (b) According to vs. 7, the incense functions for the bread as an )azkdra. The precise meaning of this term is elusive, but it has been rendered "remembrance" or "memorial".52 Aside from this verse, the term is always used with the verb hiqttr, "to make smoke", referring primarily to the part of a cereal offering which is to be burned on the altar with incense (Lev. ii 2, 9, 16, vi 8). The fistful of meal burned on the altar in the poor man's ha.t.tt is also called an )azkdrd (v 12). Because the offering is a ha.ttd)t, it is specified that the flour from which the handful is to be taken should not have oil or frankincense placed upon it (v 11). So an 'azkdr4 does not necessarily involve incense, but it is always that portion of an offer- ing which goes to God, playing a role similar to that of the fat from the sladmim offerings (Lev. iii) which is burned on the altar as YHWH's portion. Therefore, in Lev. xxiv 7, the )azkird must be interpreted as YHWH's portion of the "bread of the presence" offering. (c) According to Lev. xxiv 9, the bread is to be eaten by Aaron and his sons in a holy place. As we have seen, this is their hoq-cdldm, "perpetual due". None of it goes to an altar as a portion for YHWH. He gets only the incense, and for him to receive it as an 'azkdra it must be burned. Since the incense is an integral part of the bread offering, it must remain on the two piles53 of six loaves 51 Cp. Exod. xxix 25, referring to the ordination offerings, where the full phrase is given: )isseh hui lyhwh, "it is a gift belonging to YHWH". The pronoun hui refers to hakkol (vs. 24), covering "all" items just mentioned in vss 22, 23. Thus, the 'isseh consists of the totality of ingredients specified, comprising a sacrificial unit. 52 H. Eising, )azkdrdh, Remembrance. TDOT IV, pp. 79-80 = TWAT II, cols 589-90. 53 The word maCareket in Lev xxiv 6-7 refers to some kind of "arrangement", i.e. rows or piles. The nature of the arrangement is not clarified by etymology or context elsewhere-it is used exclusively in connection with the "bread of the presence". The related word maCirdkd may refer to a row (Exod. xxxix 37), an arrangement having both a vertical and horizontal aspect (Judg. vi 26) or an arrangement in ranks (1 Sam. iv 2, 12, 16, etc.). Other evidence is more helpful. B. Mitchell, "Leviticus 24.6: The bread of the Presence-rows or piles?", The Bible Translator 33/4 (1982), p. 447, suggests that the probability of the loaves being arranged in piles is indicated by the considerable quantity of semolina used for each loaf: "two-tenths" (Lev. xxiv 5), i.e. two-tenths of an epa (cp. Num. xxviii 196</page><page sequence="19">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE each as long as they are on the table. Thus, the burning of the incense on the inner altar54 must take place on the Sabbath when the fresh bread replaces the old bread, which may then be eaten by the priests.55 The simultaneous appropriation of the incense by YHWH and the bread by the priests rules out the possibility that consumption by the priests is secondary use. The hoq-'oldm is not a case of "crumbs from the master's table", but a bonafide primary portion. Note that my argument is based upon "ritual syntax", the logical structural relationships between ritual events.56 Since fragrant incense is a normal accompaniment to the quasi- human meal of an ancient deity,57 it could be said that the associa- tion of incense with the Israelite "bread of the presence" is an 5). An Cissdron, one-tenth of an 'epi, is equal to an 'omer as a unit of dry measure (Exod. xvi 36) and an Comer is one day's ration for one person (Exod. xvi 16). According to G. Dalman, Arbeit und Sitte in Palastina IV (Giitersloh, 1935), p. 122, each loaf of the "bread of the presence" would contain 6-8 liters of flour. Thus, the loaves are most likely too large to fit on the small table (2 cu. x 1 cu., Exod. xxv 23) in rows. On a possible polemic in the Temple Scroll (VIII 12) against practice reflected in rabbinic sources (e.g. M. Men. XI 5) and Josephus (Ant. iii ? 143) with regard to the arrangement of the bread and incense, see Y. Yadin, The Temple Scroll (Jerusalem, 1983) II, pp. 32-3. 54 In the other passages where incense is involved in an 'azkdri, the burning takes place on the outer altar in the court. According to the rabbis, the incense accompanying the "bread of the presence" was burned on the outer altar with the limbs of the daily holocause (Tos. Men. XI: 13). The Temple Scroll (VIII 11) seems to specify that the incense should be placed on the altar of incense at the time when the bread is removed. This interpretation has two factors in its favor. First, the incense placed on the bread is to be "pure". The only other place where pure frankincense is specified is Exod. xxx 34-5, where it appears as an ingredient of the special spiced, salted incense to be burned on the inner altar (vss 7, 8). Second, the "bread of the presence" is placed inside the tent and no part of it is burned on the outer altar as is the case with the cereal offerings of Lev. ii. This suggests that the ritual burning of the incense should take place along with the other ritual actions inside the tent. 55 See 1 Sam. xxi 7 (6) on this exchange. The Temple Scroll uses this verse to establish the time when the incense should be burned; see the previous note. 56 The present writer is currently working on a dissertation at the University of California, Berkeley, on the neglected topic of "ritual syntax" in ancient Israelite, Anatolian and Mesopotamian cults. The dissertation concentrates on festivals and builds on methodology developed by F. Staal in the context of Vedic rituals. Examples of Staal's work are: "Ritual Syntax", in M. Nagatomi et al. (ed.), Sanskrit and Indian Studies: Essays in Honour of Daniel H. H. Ingalls (Dordrecht, 1980), pp. 119-42; Rules Without Meaning: Ritual, Mantras and the Human Sciences (New York, 1989). 57 See, for example, Egyptian daily rites in ANET, pp. 325-6.

However, we have found that the Israelite ritual denies the most central aspect of a divine meal: con- sumption by the deity. (d) Our understanding of the three-party transaction may be fur- ther clarified by comparison with the treatment of P'ldmim ("well- being")58 offerings. The offering as a whole is brought to YHWH (Lev. iii 1, 6, 12, vii 11, 29). Since the fat belongs to YHWH it is burned on the altar (iii 16, vii 31). In vii 34, the breast and thigh are taken by God from the seldmim sacrifices which are meFet bene yisrdael, "on behalf of the Israelites", and given to the priests as a perpetual due (hoq-'oldm). The lay-people who bring the offerings get the rest (see vss 15ff. regulating consumption of this meat). Thus, there is a three-way apportionment. Lev. xxiv is similar to Lev. vii in that the people provide an offer- ing for YHWH of which he appropriates a part for himself and allots another part to the priests as a commission for their role as "agents" in carrying out the primary transaction between himself and the people. However, there are important differences. While YHWH keeps portions of the sladmm animals (vii), he retains none of the bread (xxiv), giving all of it to the priests and reserving only the incense for himself. No portion of the bread is offered on an altar to represent the sharing by YHWH of the food with the priests. Neither do the priests perform a ritual movement (henip, "elevate") with any part of the bread, which could symbolize appropriation by YHWH (cp. Lev. xxiii 11).59 Furthermore, the laity do not get back any part of the bread as they do the remaining meat of the selamim offerings because the bread is most holy (Lev. xxiv 9) and priests alone may contact such sancta (Num. iv 15-20).60 III. tamld, "regularly", and only once a week on the Sabbath If we had before us only the Exod. xxv 30 command that the bread should be placed on the table tdmid, we would undoubtedly conclude that the placing of the bread was to be a daily event, for 58 Rendered thus by J. Milgrom, Leviticus, on Lev. iii Iff., vii liff,. etc. 59 On the elevation gesture as an act of dedication, see J. Milgrom, "Hat- tenupd", in Studies in Cultic Theology and Terminology (Leiden, 1983), pp. 139-58. 60 The story about David and his men eating the old bread (1 Sam. xxi 1-7) presents an anomaly in this regard. 198</page><page sequence="21">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE all the other tdmid rituals are performed daily (Exod. xxvii 20-1: lamp; Exod. xxx 7-8: incense; Exod. xxix 38-9: holocaust). But Lev. xxiv 5-9 informs us differently: the bread is to be arranged only once a week, on the Sabbath (vs. 8). In marking the weekly rather than daily cycle,6' the bread ritual is distinguished from the other regular ritual actions inside the tent and from the daily holocaust outside. The relative permanence of the bread as com- pared with other offerings is emphasized in Num. iv 7, where the bread is the only offering which is transported with the tabernacle furniture and utensils when the Israelites break camp. In non-Israelite practice, food was placed for the daily meal of the god and the table cleared when the meal was over.62 By con- trast, the Israelite bread is placed on the table only once a week. Again, anthropomorphism is restricted. However, it must be remembered that the only portion appropriated by YHWH for himself is the incense. He does not merely have a metabolism which functions at one-seventh the rate normal for deities: he does not consume the bread at all. The changing of the bread on the Sabbath is crucial for the meaning of the bread, not only because the weekly rather than daily performance of the ritual shows a distancing from anthropomor- phism, but because there is a positive link with the Sabbath, which carries theological freight of its own-especially the idea of crea- tion. Caution must be exercised at this point. Just because the bread happens to be changed on the Sabbath, it does not follow that the bread is to be explained in terms of Sabbath theology. How- ever, since additional factors tie the bread to Sabbath and creation, a much stronger case for a theological connection may be made. (1) Aside from Lev. xxiv 8, only in Exod. xxxi 16 is berit Coldm an "eternal covenant" established during the wilderness period between God and the Israelites as a whole.63 In Exod. xxxi 16-17, 61 Cf. 2 Kgs xi 5, 9, the weekly changing of the temple guard on the Sabbath. 62 F.

Gen. ii 2-3) and, as stated by vs. 13, the fact that YHWH sanctifies Israel. It should be pointed out that Exod. xxxi 12-17, commanding Sabbath observance, is striking in that it is saturated with thought and phraseology prominent in the "Holiness" section of Leviticus (xvii-xxvi),65 which includes the ritual of the bread (xxiv). For example, holy conduct, in this case the observance of the Sabbath, involves the imitation of God (vs. 17) as in Lev. xix 2. Phrases com- mon to Exod. xxxi 12-17 and the "Holiness" section of Leviticus are: "You shall observe my Sabbaths" (vs. 13; Lev. xix 3, 30, xxvi 2), "for I am YHWH who sanctifies you" (vs. 13; Lev. xx 8, xxi 8, xxii 32, etc.), "that person shall be cut off from among (miqqereb) his people" (vs. 14; Lev. xvii 4, 10, xx 3, 5, 6) and "Sabbath of solemn rest" (sabbat sabbdton, vs. 15; Lev. xxiii 3). (2) Cassuto66 and P.J. Kearney67 have shown a number of con- nections, of which the Sabbath is one, between sections of the book of Exodus dealing with the tabernacle and the creation story in Genesis. Subsequently, Weinfeld has further developed the link between creation and the tabernacle/temple. His main points are as follows: (a) God's dwelling in his sanctuary is considered as "rest" (Ps. cxxxii 8, 14), parallel to the concept of the sanctuary in the ancient Near East, and to the seventh day's rest in Genesis (Gen. ii 2-3). (b) The completion of the tabernacle parallels the comple- tion of the universe in Genesis. Mention of the Sabbath appears immediately following the instructions for building the tabernacle (Exod. xxxi 12-17), just as it comes at the end of the creation week 64 The other covenant signs ('6t bert) between God and human beings are the rainbow (covenant with Noah: Gen. ix 13) and circumcision (covenant with Abraham: Gen. xvii 11).

(c) The seventh day as the day of completion appears both in the tabernacle accounts (Exod. xxiv 15ff.) and in the crea- tion stories. (d) In the ancient Near East, creation and temple building are associated with the notion of enthronement. (e) Crea- tion and the enthronement of God are tied together in the Old Testament (Ps. xciii, xxix 3, 10).68 Since the Sabbath is based on YHWH's behavior at the time of creation and the "bread of the presence" emphasizes that the tabernacle is the dwelling-place of YHWH (see I. (hap)pdnim..., above), the relevance of a connection between creation and the tabernacle is clear. In (a)-(c), above, note the significance of the Sabbath in linking the ideas of creation and temple/tabernacle. Both (b) and my discussion in (1), above, show that Exod. xxxi 12- 17 is particularly important in establishing a relationship between Sabbath-creation on the one hand and bread-tabernacle on the other. We may add a specific point of correspondence between the "bread of the presence" ritual and creation: YHWH enjoys the incense of the bread offering only at the end of each week, just as he enjoyed his rest at the end of the creation week. IV. Conclusion In its re-definition of cultic bread-laying within an Israelite con- text, the "bread of the presence" ritual walks a theological tightrope. This caution is understandable. It is inside the tent, precisely in connection with the table, that there is the greatest danger of anthropomorphic imagery leading to mythic conceptions about God. However, the "bread of the presence" is not merely a frozen relic divested of its (otherwise) primary significance. There is a positive theological re-formulation established through connec- tions to the concepts of covenant, Sabbath and creation. (1) We have found that the designation of the cultic bread as of (hap)pdnim, "of the presence", emphasizes YHWH's residence with Israel, while the absence of a prescription for an accompany- ing libation limits the anthropomorphism necessarily involved in 68 Weinfeld, "Sabbath, Temple and the Enthronement of the Lord-The Problem of the Sitz im Leben of Genesis 1:1-2:3", in A.

The bread is a berit Coldm, "eternal covenant", between Israel and YHWH, but the ritual denies that YHWH consumes the bread brought to him by Israel. The bread offering is arranged tdmid, "regularly", but unlike other tdmid rituals, the bread-changing takes place only once a week on the Sabbath. (2) The bread functions within the context of the tabernacle. Thus, we expect the theological statement provided by the bread and its ritual to emphasize aspects of the meaning of the tabernacle. This is, in fact, the case. Both the bread and the tabernacle are tied to the covenant and to creation. The basic significance of the taber- nacle is that YHWH dwells among Israel (Exod. xxv 8), his presence in the portable shrine providing direct and intimate leadership for his covenant people (see Exod. xxxiii 14, 15).69 The special terms used with the "bread of the presence": (hap)pdnim, berit Coldm and tdmid, express in various ways the same concept of YHWH's close and continuing relationship with Israel. Weinfeld, building on evidence pointed out by Cassuto and Kearney, has sup- ported the nexus between tabernacle/temple and creation by demonstrating that YHWH's resting-place among his people parallels the Sabbath, his time of rest at the end of the creation week. Thus, the Sabbath is a common denominator between the "bread of the presence" and creation. The fact that bread, i.e. basic food,70 is placed upon the golden table inside the sanctuary suggests a more intrinsic connection with creation: YHWH as the Creator continues to provide for and sus- tain his creatures (cf. Ps. civ 14-15), cxlv 15-16; Job xii 10; Dan. v 23).71 However, as the Creator, YHWH admits no dependence upon human beings: "Were I hungry, I would not tell you, for 69 Note the breach of the covenant at the time of the Golden Calf episode (Exod. xxxii) called into question the building of the tabernacle. See R.W.L. Moberly, At the Mountain of God (Sheffield, 1983), p. 63. 70 "The first thing in life is water, and bread, and clothing, and a house for the sake of privacy" (Ecclus xxix 21, The Jerusalem Bible). 71 Note also that the sample of manna kept permanently, not as a renewable offering, in the sanctuary before the "testimony" (Exod. xvi 33-4), i.e. before the ark of the testimony (Exod. xxv 22, xxvi 33, 34, etc.), reminds Israel of the food (lehem: Exod. xvi 15), which YHWH provided for Israel during the wildlerness sojourn. Aaron's rod which sprouted almonds (also food) is kept in the same place as a reminder that his line, chosen for cultic service, has a special connection with YHWH, the Creator (Num. xvii 16-26). 202</page><page sequence="25">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE 203 Mine is the world and all it holds. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of he-goats?" (Ps. 1 12-13, new Jewish Publication Society translation). Accordingly, while the bread is continually placed on his table to show that the covenant and his creative power are ongoing, YHWH consumes none of it, but assigns it to those who carry out ministry on behalf of his people, who provided the offering in the first place. Because of the covenant with YHWH, Israel is privileged to have the Creator-Provider residing among them.</page></plain_text>
