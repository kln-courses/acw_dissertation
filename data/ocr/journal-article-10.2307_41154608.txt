<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN THE AGE OF LAUD GEORGE HENDERSON Part 1: 'The Bishop of Canterburies Bibles' The great Anglian High Cross at Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, displays on its obverse and reverse sculptured reliefs illustrating mainly the Gospels and Gospel commentaries.1 Having stood for about nine hundred years zsfidei Christianae signum .... sacrae crucis vexillum2 in that province, the Ruthwell Cross was broken in pieces by iconoclasts. Sentence of demolition was passed on it by the act of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, minuted on 30th July 1642: 'Anent the report of idolatrous monuments in the Kirk of Ruthwa(ll) the Assemblie finds that the monument therein mentioned is idolatrous, and therefore recommends to the Presbytrie that they careful(l)y urge the order prescrived be the act of Parliament anent the abolishing of these monuments, to be put in execution'.3 The assault on the Ruthwell Cross was, of course, a result of that general shift of opinion about the usefulness of images in Christian worship that marks the Protestant Reformation. But the assault on the Cross has also a narrower and more specific context in the public and private activities of supporters and opponents of Bible illustration in Britain in the age of William Laud. These contrary activities fall into a coherent sequence, the cultural significance of which has not been commented upon before. The Calvinists in Scotland, after the phase of violent mob iconoclasm under John Knox in the late 1550's and the 1560's,4 were engaged in a desultory unsystematic fashion to eradicate what they called 'the dregs of bygone Idolatrie' up and down the country. But what reanimated extreme Puritan zeal in this matter was that in the course of the social, political, and religious crisis in Scotland from around the Scottish coronation of Charles I, in the view of a vocal party in Scotland idolatry was not merely 'bygone' but current, intrusive, powerfully backed by the King's ecclesiastical advisers. The popular mood in Scotland in 1633 when Charles came north to be crowned was unpropitious and continued so throughout the 1630's. Signs and prodigies abounded. In 1633 a gale blew down the crown-shaped steeple of King's College Chapel in Old Aberdeen. The tides ceased their accustomed ebb and flow. 'Ane monster like beist, haveing the heid like to ane gryt mastif dog or swyne, and handis, armes, and papis like to ane man', appeared in the estuary of the River Don, coming for 'no good to noble Abirdein'. A great blazing star or comet, shaped like a crab, was seen at Elgin, and the River Southesk suddenly dried up, presaging 'gryt trubles in Scotland'.5 King Charles was crowned at Holyrood, with High Church accoutrements and ceremony, bowing and becking.6 Alarming expensive 173</page><page sequence="2">restorations were mooted by the Court, for example the rebuilding of the largely demolished St Andrews Cathedral, an idealistic venture as much disliked locally in Scotland as the restoration of Old St Paul's was by the Puritans of London.7 Laud, Bishop of London, soon to be Archbishop of Canterbury, who accompanied King Charles to Scotland, was openly contemptuous of Scottish church fabrics, fittings, and customs.8 He sought to promote a set form of ordination for the Scottish clergy, '...if this be a Novation among them, its high time they had it'.9 He busied himself with drafting a liturgy, to correct 'that diversitie, nay deformine which is used in Scotland...'10 'Laud's Liturgy' was introduced by royal authority at Easter 1637, and resistance broke out in riots and assemblies. The National Covenant, an Old Testament concept implying direct relation between the people and God - no intermediary hierarchy or government - was signed from February 1638 onwards. The King summoned a General Assembly of the Church in Glasgow in November 1638, to which he sent his chaplain from the Savoy Chapel, a Scot, Walter Balcanquall, Dean of Durham. Conciliatory moves came too late. The Assembly moved into open defiance of the King and rejected his bishops, Scottish and English, and the imposed liturgy.11 Into this turmoil slipped, either through mischief or imprudence, an illustrated Bible. We first hear of it in the diary of the lawyer and religious fanatic Archibald Johnston of Wariston, one of the compilers of the National Covenant, right-hand man of Alexander Henderson, the leading Covenanting minister. On Friday 3rd August 1638 he notes: 'receaved letters with ane Bible ful of pictures from London'.12 The letter he received is no doubt the one published in Glasgow in 1 766 in a volume of Memorials and Letters relating to the Reign of Charles the First. This letter is anonymous, addressed from England to two confidents in Scotland (Johnston and perhaps Henderson?): 'That you may taste a little of our condition, I have sent you two of your own Scots Bibles, your New Testament only, wherein they have placed such abominable pictures, that horrible impiety stares through them; these come forth by public authority. Do you show them to such as you think meet; I send to each of you one of them'.13 There is, as I believe, a slight complication about what is meant by 'your own Scots Bible, your New Testament'. I shall return to this point shortly. However, the reference to public authority suggests that the Bibles in which the pictures appeared were printed by licence of the King, by royal privilege, and therefore contained the Authorised version. Robert Young was the King's printer of Bibles in Scotland, appointed in 1632. He gave up his Edinburgh business in the troubles of 1638.14 In 1639, in London, he printed A Large Declaration Concerning the Late Tumults in Scotland, written by Walter Balcanquall on behalf of and in the name of the King. The author was bent on 'unmasking the seditious practises of the prime leaders of the Covenanters'. Among many other vexed topics he sought to confute rumours about the Bible pictures and to assert the King's total innocence in the matter. His account is important and circumstantial: 174</page><page sequence="3">* About the same time a great stirre was raised in that Kingdome upon a very slender ground, which was this: There had been printed at Antwerpe in severall pieces, the pictures of the severall stories of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, after the manner as they are usually printed in the Romish Church; some Papists, and it may be others, had caused these severall pieces to be bound in their Bibles, at the severall chapters of those stories to which they did relate; they found such a Bible printed at Edinburgh, which being printed (as all Bibles are) by Our priviledge, upon a sudden there were made most tragicall complaints, that pictures and images were brought into their Bibles by Our authoritie, aggravated by the heads of that faction, especially the Ministers, with the imminent dangers of the present introduction of Poperie, Superstition, &amp; Idolatrie, still to make the people averse from all hope of satisfaction; so that some did conceive, that these pictures might be bound in that Bible by some of themselves, meerly to irritate the people, and continue them in their distance from returning to Our obedience'.15 It seems likely that King Charles was embarrassed by the Scottlish reaction to these Bibles. Embarrassment was not all that Laud was to suffer on their account. Upon the groundswell of English Puritan indignation at the activities of the bench of bishops, including evidently the promotion of these Bible pictures ('that you may taste a little of our condition', that is, the pictures were known and resented in London), the spontaneous or calculated 'stirre' in Scotland came in a strong current back to England, to Westminster. The Scottish mutiny was supported by the Long Parliament. The King's chief adviser in the Scottish affair, Archbishop Laud, was arrested, impeached, and the process of a trial for treason began.16 The Scottish Commissioners at Westminster in 1640 declared that if the Pope himself had been in Laud's place 'he could not have been more Popish'. Laud was accused of having 'induced the King to warre with the Scotts ... and hath brought in many Superstitions and Innovations into the Church of Scotland'. His enemies affirmed '...how soon he would have there (in the Chapel of Lambeth Palace) introduced the very Masse it selfe, had not the Scottish troubles interrupted his designes, his owne Notes of approbation written in the Masse booke, his framing the Scottish new liturgy by it, ... will abundantly evidence unto all the world...'17 At Laud's arrest and removal from Lambeth Palace to the Tower, his study and books were scrutinised and their evidence brought to his trial. He was accused of possessing an Antwerp Missal of 1630 'with many Idolatrous Pictures of Christ, Crucifixes, &amp;c. printed within it, in Copper peeces accurately cut...' Furthermore he possessed 'A Popish Book neatly bound up in Turky Leather with guilt leaves, intituled Imagines Vitae, Passionis &amp; Mortis, D.N. Jesu Christi, printed by Boetius a Bolswert, 1623. cum gratia &amp; Privilegio: beginning with the Picture of the Annuntiation, and concluding with the Assumption of the blessed Virgin, containing in all 74. Idolatrous Superstitious Pictures of Christ, and the Virgin Mary...'18 In the copy of this work in Cambridge University Library19 the illustrations accompany meditations on the Life of Christ by the Jesuit 175</page><page sequence="4">Johannes Bourghesius, and are the work of the distinguished engraver of Antwerp, Boethius Bolswert, who with his brother Schelt was an outstanding colleague of Rubens. Boethius Bolswert died in 1633.20 Confronted with these Roman Catholic books, Laud took a line critical of their content. He is accused of reading the Missal diligently, but 'how else should I be able really to confute what is amiss in it?' So with the book of Bolswerťs engravings, 'it was fit for me to have it. For some things are to be seen in their Pictures for the People which their Writings do not, perhaps dare not avow'. He says further, 'I kept it only as a Scholler, to peruse and refute it upon occasion, not to adore or make use of the Pictures in it...'21 What 'their writings ... dare not avow* was probably the tendency to represent God the Father in bodily form. Bolswerťs engraving of the Annunciation includes God the Father and the Son in heaven, and God the Father appears also in heaven in the Baptism of Christ; God the Father is conspicuous again in the Transfiguration, and in the scene of the cursing of the barren fig tree, which includes also Christ's prayer that is answered by a voice from heaven (Pi. 1). The dialogue between Laud and his accusers is reported in Cant- erburies Doome, published in 1646 and compiled by William Prynne the Puritan agitator, author of the notorious Histriomastix, the attack on the theatres published in 1633 by Michael Sparke, who also published Canterburies Doome. Laud's mitigating pleas regarding his possession of Bolswerťs book are dismissed in an interesting way. 'This Book', say his accusers, 'was (as the Papists stile their Images) a meer ignorant Lay-mans, not a learned Archbishops Book, consisting meerly of unlawful Pictures: Therefore he had it only to view, not read'.22 However the copy in Cambridge University Library combines words and images, text and pictures. Its meditational nature is obvious from, for example, the allegorical picture of the youthful Christ willingly accepting the instruments of the Passion (Pi. 2), and also from the actual text opposite the illustration of the Assumption of the Virgin in which as Magistra fidelium her solemn commitment of herself into the hands of her son is piously enlarged upon. But Laud was not accused of reading these Meditations. So he evidently owned the set of plates only, bound up with the title-£age that his accusers quote. This material had presumably come from Antwerp, 'printed ... in severall pieces', ready if desired to be bound into a different kind of book. Before following through the implications of this, we may note two further facts about Laud's copy of Bolswerťs engravings. His accusers say '...his curious guilding of the Book and Pictures in it, argues that he prized it more than ordinary to help him in his Devotions'. Thus it would seem that the engravings in Laud's copy had been illuminated, gilded. Later we shall meet with examples of hand-coloured engravings in this period. Further, 'Betweene the leaves of this Booke, there were 12. severall loos Pictures in fine vellom, about the bignesse of playing Cards of the largest size, gloriously and curiously guilded, and set forth with most exquisite colours, some having one, others, two or three Pictures a peece in them, of 176</page><page sequence="5">Christ and the Virgin Mary in severall shapes and formes, with glories about their heads, and sometimes Crosses on their backs, and the Holy Ghost in form of a Dove; prettie Babies for young children to play with, but most insufferable Puppets, for an Old childish superstitious Archbishop seriously to dote on...'23 The gilding of these Andachtsbilder may have got mis-applied, in reports, to the Bolswert engravings, but the engravings could well have been coloured. Laud's worst offence was not mere possession of the Bolswert engravings and related devotional aids. His worst offence was the inserting of 'Popish Pictures of the Birth, Life, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ, the Holy Ghost, the Apostles, yea the very Assumption of the Virgin Mary and the like into our English Bibles...'24 And into Scottish Bibles too, as we might assume from the evidence of the 'stirre' described above, and from the survival of an Edinburgh printed Bible of 1633 into which Bolswert's engravings had been bound.25 Opposite the title-page of the Authorised version of the New Testament, issued cum privilegio, is rather flagrantly inserted Bolswert's 76th plate, with its Latin inscription celebrating the Virgin as coeli Regina (PL 3). The devotional image of Christ kneeling to receive the instruments of the Passion is inserted at Luke III, where verse 23 says 'And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph...' This is of course an uncanonical scene in an ordinary Gospel sequence. The other illustrations are carefully accommodated in the Gospels. They are, as the author of A Large Declaration states, bound in at the several chapters of those stories to which they did relate. Consequently the original Bolswert sequence is in disarray, as the numbers on the prints reveal; they come now 17, 18, 28, 27, 19, 45, and so on. They are distributed irregularly through the Gospel narratives, thirty-three of them in Matthew, containing much Passion material, twelve in Mark, sixteen in Luke, where no Passion scenes occur, and fourteen in John. Along with the Assumption, and the powerful images of God the Father in human guise, and the Dove of the Holy Spirit, a strikingly Romanising image appears in Bolswert's scene of the Circumcision, inserted at Luke II-III. The upper half of the design displays the glorification of Christ's name, Jesus H ominum Salvátor in the form of the monogram I H S (cf. PL 13). This monogram was adopted as a seal device by Ignatius Loyola, and the Jesuit Order later added the cross over the H and the nails below.26 These illustrations in Covenanters' hands would be certain to give offence. But there is one feature of this edition that does not tally with the description given by the author of A Large Declaration of the pictures printed at Antwerp in several pieces, 'the pictures of the severall stories of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles'. Bolswert's second last design, No. 75, illustrates Pentecost, which is described in The Acts of the Apostles, II. There is nothing else in Johannes Bourghesius's Meditations that deals with material from Acts. In the Edinburgh 1633 Bible the Bolswert engraving 75 is bound in at the beginning of Acts. Was that solitary illustration all that the author of A Large Declaration meant when he referred to 'the pictures of the severall 177</page><page sequence="6">stories of ... Acts'? Further evidence offered at Laud's trial considerably complicates the matter of Laud's involvement in this kind of illustrated Bible. The pictures by Boethius Bolswert were the 'very Pictures', say Laud's accusers, 'licensed by the Archbishops own chaplain Doctor Bray; printed by his own printer and kinsman Badger, in the year 1638. for one Peake a Stationer (now in armes against the Parliament)' (that is in 1645-6) 'and publickly sold and bound up in Bibles; as was testified by Mr Walley Clerk of Stationers Hall, and Michael Sparke Senior. Master Willingham likewise attested upon oath concerning these Pictures and Crucifixes put into the Bibles: that Captain Peake at Holborne Cundit, Bookseller, who printed these pictures for Bibles, did affirme, that he printed them with the good liking, and by the speciali direction of the Archbishop, and his chaplaine Dr Bray: which Dr Bray, as he said, carried him divers times to the Archbishop, to shew him the prints thereof, as they were cut and finished, who liked them all well, and gave his consent for the binding them up in Bibles; saying, That the Bibles wherein these pictures were bound up, they should be called THE BISHOP OF CANTERBURIES BIBLES'.27 On this evidence the 1633 Edinburgh New Testament is not technically one of 'The Bishop of Canterburies Bibles' at all. The illustrations are merely Bolswert's own, separately bound in. No new engraving has taken place. With the name Peake we have moved into the history of English engraving and distinguished book publishing. The King and Court could hardly be ignorant of his activities or unsympathetic to them. This Peake was the son of Robert Peake, Senior, who was Sergeant Painter to King James, who painted the official portrait of Prince Charles in 1613 for the University of Cambridge, and who published the first English edition of Serlio's Book of Architecture, dedicated to Henry, Prince of Wales.28 Robert Peake, Junior, was equally respectable. We know about him from Vertue's Notebooks. He sold prints in a shop on Snow Hill near Holborn Conduit. For a time he employed William Faithorne, later the most famous engraver and printseller of the Restoration period. He was with Wenceslaus Hollar at the seige of Basing House in 1645, says Vertue. He was knighted, as a loyal royalist soldier, at Oxford in 1645 by King Charles. He survived to become Vice-President of the Honorable Artillery Company, dying in 1667, long after Laud's troubles and responsibilities had ended on the scaffold.29 From the evidence so far educed, we can perceive two phases of illustrated Bibles, both preceding the Scottish scandal of 1638. Laud himself certainly distinguished a phase for which he denied any responsibility. 'As I was at prayers in the Kings chapel at Whitehall, I there saw one of these Bibles in Mistresse Kirkes hand. She was far enough from any affection to Rome! And this being the first knowledge I had of it, many were vented and sold before I could prevent it. Upon this I sent for one, and acquainted the Lords of the Council with it, and craved their direction...' It was resolved by the Lords of the Council, and by Laud, that 178</page><page sequence="7">these books should be available for sale privately but not displayed publicly on the stalls.30 Laud never alludes to his supposed relation with Robert Peake. Peake cannot have been a willing witness against him, but must either have been forced to give evidence, like Browne the Carpenter at Lambeth Palace who testified about the new furnishings of the Chapel,31 or more probably Peake was simply reported by hearsay. That Robert Peake was intimately involved, exactly in preparing new engravings of Bolswerťs originals and in the sale of Bible illustrations, can be proved up to the hilt in many printed Bibles of the 1630's. In an Edinburgh edition of the New Testament, printed by Robert Young in 1636,32 we find Peake reproducing Bolswerťs designs, but substituting English texts below, making them more strictly Bible illustrations relating to chapter and verse of the Gospels. The numbering of the Bolswert prints is eradicated. The characteristic lourdeur commented on by students of seventeenth century engravings in respect of Boethius Bolswerťs prints is accentuated by the very pedestrian quality of the Peake engravings. These plates are not without iconographie interest. For example, in the scene of the Flagellation Christ stands at the typically Counter-Reformation short anvil-shaped pillar, so different from the tall architectural column represented in the Middle Ages. It is in the matter of iconography that the point of Robert Peake's involvement is revealed. He edits out the two Persons of the Trinity from the sky in the Annunciation scene. He omits the Father from the Baptism of Christ, also from the Transfiguration, and from the scene of Christ's prayer to the Father answered, in St John's Gospel, XII, at verse 28, replacing God comically with a cheerful anthropomorphic sun.33 In the resulting print one or two bystanders are left paying a suspicious amount of attention to a mere change in the weather (Pi. 4). The contemporary colouring and gilding on this Peake engraving, in a copy of the Edinburgh 1636 New Testament in Cambridge University Library, adds particular emphasis to the designs.34 The omission of God the Father from these scenes marks a clear distinction between the attitude to the representation of God in England and the attitude not only in Catholic countries but also in Protestant Germany. For example, the communion table, dated 1626, in the Parish Church of strongly Lutheran Marburg an der Lahn, is decorated with small marble reliefs representing Gospel scenes. God the Father erupts from clouds in the chamber where the archangel Gabriel annunciates to the Virgin, and also presides in the sky over the Baptism of Christ.35 Robert Peake's engraver made no effort, however, to modify the Jesuitical monogram of Christ in the illustration of the Circumcision. This remains exactly as in Bolswerťs original (Pi. 13), which suggests that the patron or patrons of Peake were positively sympathetic to this device, in spite of their distaste for representations of God the Father. The I H S monogram, topped by a cross and set in a flaming glory, is a conspicuous feature of the main gable of the west front of St Paul's Cathedral, in Inigo Jones's first design for the facade, dating to 1634. This brings us close to Laud, who as Bishop of London was a prime mover in the restoration of St Paul's.36 179</page><page sequence="8">The rendering of the series of Gospel illustrations innocuous, so to say, is only very partial. Peake perhaps quite gradually worked out a series of New Testament illustrations, not all of them narrative. He issued four prints representing the four Evangelists, each accompanied by his symbolic beast, derived from a source other than Bolswert but arranged, with verses underneath, to conform with the narrative illustrations proper. Matthew is inscribed: * Are to be sould by Rob: Peake at his shopp nere Holborne Conduit*. His engraver re-engraved the Bolswert print of the Assumption, with an English inscription; this appears in a London 1634 edition of the New Testament in the Library of the British and Foreign Bible Society, printed by Robert Barker the King's printer,37 relegated to an apt passage in the Book of Revelation, I, 6, 'And hath made us kings and priests unto God his Father*. As preface to the Gospels Peake prepared in place of the overtly Catholic Assumption another Virgin, a particularly wooden engraving of an Eyckian type, seated, holding the Christ child, with insipid verses below. To a Calvinist this would be no more acceptable than the Bolswert design of the Assumption but it was presumably more acceptable to moderate Church opinion. It is more commonly current, I believe, than the Assumption scene, and essentially represents a substitute by Peake.38 The placing of the Peake engravings is generally uniform, although clearly there is personal taste and discretion displayed in some or any irregularities that occur. The Peake engravings were available for purchase, at his shop, and they appear in Bibles printed in different places. The process of printing, and the date of printing, are of course distinct from the binding-in of the pictures. Thomas Buck and Roger Daniel were the printers to the University of Cambridge. In a 1637 Cambridge Bible in the University Library39 the Peake version of Bolswerťs Temptation of Christ (PL 5) is placed as preface to the whole Bible, opposite the first title-page to the Old and New Testaments. Christ has a Creator-like appearance, as if resting on the seventh day, but the specific subject is Christ serenely triumphant over Satan's wiles, as the second Adam, redeeming the first Adam's faults. This weighting of the Temptation story, its isolation as the sole prefatory picture before the Old Testament, is similar to the emphasis that Milton was later to put on the narrative of the Temptation in Paradise Regained, antithetical in theme to his account of Paradise Lost. That men of Milton's persuasion could have looked with equanimity at some at least of these illustrated editions of scripture is perhaps suggested by the range of material that gets bound up with them - if it was so bound up contemporaneously. The Bible Society's volume that contains the New Testament with Peake's version of the Assumption of the Virgin, Robert Barker's printing of 1634, also contains a tract printed by Robert Young in London in 1633, which interprets the Book of Revelation in a strongly anti- papal way. The Pope is the king of the locusts (Revelation IX) who issues foggy mists of false doctrine. The locusts themselves are monks and friars. Like Mistress Kirk, the owner of this tract was 'no friend to Rome'. The same volume, again, contains the Old Testament, printed by Robert 180</page><page sequence="9">Barker in 1636. It has a title-page decorated with small figures of the Apostles at the right, balanced at the left by heraldic shields of the twelve tribes of Israel, a design closely related to the title-page of an earlier Robert Barker Bible, his 1608 printing of the Geneva translation.40 The Bible Society's copy of the 1634 London New Testament contains not only the Gospel illustrations re-engraved by Peake's engraver. It also includes original engravings of the kind that Peake in his role of print seller might have imported and sold to the public or to book sellers. In each of the Gospels is inserted a group of numbered scenes from the Life of St John the Baptist, from an extensive series of elegant engravings after Marten de Vos, the prolific Antwerp artist who died in 1603. They are regrouped in the Gospels, out of their original order, Nos. 11, St John preaching to the people, and 17 in Matthew; 12, 13, 10, 16, 18, 20, 21, including the story of Salome's dance before Herod, in Mark; Luke naturally has the Baptist's Nativity story, Peake's Evangelist portrait of St Luke with his calf being juxtaposed with de Vos's design No. 1, the angel appearing to Zacharias in the Temple, followed by 2, 3, 4, and 5; St John's Gospel has 14 and 15, this last representing the Baptist's testimony to Christ, 'Behold the Lamb of God'. The owner of this New Testament was evidently particularly interested in the life of Christ's precursor.41 In addition we find a set of figures of the Apostles. These appear in lieu of narrative illustrations to Acts. They are inserted in Acts after Peake's version of Bolswert's Pentecost, featuring Peake's sale notice, 'to be sould by Rob: Peake', below the text. Since there is a similar notice on Peake's engraving of the Evangelist St Matthew, the first in his series after the prefatory Virgin, the same note on the Pentecost might mark at some stage the end of Peake's series. The standing Apostles are dispersed throughout Acts. They do not spill over into the Epistles. They are frail tall figures, on pasted-in strips cut from a continuous band evidently illustrating in the background the Passions of the Apostles.42 Apparently feeling a need for a uniform set of Apostles, specially prepared, not just paste-ins, Peake provided a series of Apostle portraits, bust length, in roundels. Buck's and Daniel's Cambridge 1637 Bible displays these Apostle heads, from St Peter onwards. They are dispersed throughout Acts, with others from the same set in the Epistles. The same series is displayed with rather tighter organisation in another of Buck's and Daniel's Cambridge Bibles, a volume dateci 1630,43 where St Peter's portrait appears at St Peter's Epistle, St John opposite St John's Epistle, and so on, and the only illustration in Acts is Peake's version of Bolswert's Pentecost. Presumably after the stage marked by the manufacture of these formal portraits of the Apostles (copied from some superior earlier engravings) which occasionally serve to decorate Acts but have a more useful function as author portraits in the doctrinal, non-narrative Epistles, Peake compiled a regular series of narrative illustrations to Acts. If we take literally the author of A Large Declaration's reference to 'pictures of the ... Acts of the Apostles', then the New Testaments that caused scandal in Scotland were not those with Bolswert's unedited pictures but were those 181</page><page sequence="10">rendered comparatively innocuous by Peake, containing his whole systematic series of prefatory and narrative pictures. There is perhaps some historical likelihood that this was so. The twelve scenes from Acts comprise (within very strict limits) Peake 's workshop's most creative contribution to the Bibles that we have been considering. In the second part of this study I shall indicate some of the impressive sources he drew on to compile them, as a smooth continuation from Bolswert's Gospel scenes, after the Pentecost scene. Illustrations to Acts might be intended to reduce still further the meditational quality of Bolswert's Gospel scenes, as rearranged as a straightforward chronological narrative series. That the Acts were popular with and familiar to the Puritans is shown by the case of Alexander Leighton, a fanatical scurrilous Scot who published a tract called S ion's Plea Against Prelacy in 1630. He referred to the bishops as 'wens of bunchy popish flesh', and he also insulted Queen Henrietta Maria. He was tried for libel, and sentenced to an enormous fine and various mutilations; but pending all this he contrived to escape from the Fleet Prison, and his fellow Puritans likened his escape to St Peter's miraculous delivery from prison by an angel in Acts XII (PL 19). On the other hand, High Church sentiments were strongly for St Paul. In 1631 Bishop Corbett of Norwich preached in favour of raising funds for St Paul's Cathedral: 'St Paul's Church! One word on behalf of St Paul; he hath spoken many in ours. He hath raised our inward temples; let us help to requite him in his outward'.44 Six of the twelve subjects from Acts in this cycle of illustrations concern St Paul (PL 15). So perhaps both religious parties had equal interest in Acts. More specific evidence about the promotion of these New Testament illustrations is perhaps contained in the texts inscribed beneath them. The flowing script of the texts below the Acts illustrations is more eye-catching than the ordinary printed texts below the Gospel illustrations, but both types of inscription have a peculiarity in common, namely that they frequently deviate from the text of the Authorised version. Since all these pictures are bound into copies of the Authorised version, and since pains were taken to align the pictures with the relevant chapters and verses, the verbal discrepancies are obvious at a glance. Sometimes they involve only a word here and there, for example in the healing of the leper in Matthew VIII, 2, the Authorised version reads 'And behold there came a leper', whereas the text inscribed on Peake's engraving is 'And loe there came a leper'. In the scene of Christ at the house of Mary and Martha in Luke X, 39, the Authorised version reads 'And this woman had a sister called Marie, which also sate at Jesus' feet and heard his word', whereas the text inscribed on the engraved illustration reads '...and heard his preaching'. On other occasions whole sequences of words are different, for example when the child Christ disputes with the doctors in the Temple, Luke II, 42, 43. The Authorised version reads 'And when he was twelve year old, they went up to Jerusalem, after the custome of the feast, and when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the childe Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother knew not of it...' The text inscribed 182</page><page sequence="11">on Peake's illustration (PL 11) reads 'And when he was twelve yeare old, and they were come up to Jerusalem, after the custome of the feast. And had finished the dayes thereof, as they returned, the child Jesus remayned in Jerusalem, and Joseph knew not nor his mother../ An example of marked divergency in Acts is the hypocrisy of Ananias and Sapphira in A cts V, 2, where the Authorised version reads 'And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it', whereas the illustration (PL 22) is inscribed 'And kept away part of the price, his wife also being of counsel*. Also in the account of the incident of St Paul and the viper at the camp fire on the shore at Malta, Acts XXVIII, 3, 5, the Authorised version reads 'There came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand ... And he shook off the beast into the fire', whereas the illustration is inscribed 'There came a viper out of the heate and leapt on his hand ... But he shooke of the worme into the fire'. All these New Testament readings that deviate from the Authorised version were taken by the engraver from the old Geneva Bible of around 1560, William Whittingham's text of the New Testament based on Theodore Beza's translation from the Greek.45 William Fulke calls this the text 'commonly used in the church of England' in his book, dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, confuting the preface and glosses included in the Catholic translation of the New Testament into English, published at 'Rhemes' in 1582.46 The Geneva Bible was printed in Scotland in 1576-79.47 Disliked by King James, the Geneva Bible was the very text which the Authorised version was planned to oust. It had no currency in England in the 1630's except against Laud's will. His resolute stand against cheap foreign printed Geneva Bibles and their Calvinist notes was a point of complaint against him by the Puritan booksellers at his trial.48 Would he ever have encouraged Peake to engrave the Geneva text? It seems highly unlikely; yet I suppose one circumstance might explain it. The Authorised version, though officially printed by the King's printer in Scotland, had no official status in the Church of Scotland. The Scots clung to the Calvinist Geneva Bible. In Alexander Henderson's sermon at the rebellious Assembly of 1638 he quoted his text from the Geneva Bible.49 If these Gospel and Acts illustrations were deliberately planned for the Scottish market, Laud might have permitted the use in their inscriptions of the text that he despised, by familiar words to intrude unfamiliar images. Some of Young's Edinburgh New Testaments were visually fitted out for the Scottish market in that they have an end plate showing the royal arms with the Garter belt-buckle curiously modified, or rather replaced, by the medallion with St Andrew and his cross from the collar of the Scottish Order of the Thistle (PL 6).50 When the anonymous English correspondent wrote to Archibald Johnston, and perhaps also to Alexander Henderson, sending them copies of 'your own Scots bible, your New Testament only', we might think that he would necessarily mean the Geneva version. I have not been able, however, to trace a Geneva Bible containing Peake's or Bolswert's pictures. The evidence educed at Laud's trial placed him at the centre of the 183</page><page sequence="12">commissioning of 'The Bishop of Canterburies Bibles'. Whether or not he had promoted the Bibles with the genuine Bolswert illustrations (he was caught red-handed with the Bolswert illustrations in his possession), he was reliably reported to have supervised their reworking by Robert Peake. All this evidence, called 'irrefragable', was set out, as we have seen, by Laud's personal enemy, William Prynne, whose ears he had had cropped and whom he fined for his polemic publications. Fined along with Prynne was his associate the Puritan printer and bookseller Michael Sparke.51 Now oddly enough Michael Sparke, in the year before his death, that is in 1652, published a strange part-tract, part self-advertisement, in which he showed himself, even under the Commonwealth, a discontented agitator, still whining about the abuses of monopolies in publication, and jealous to the point of persecution about the successes of other publishers. His 1652 pamphlet contains a rambling reminiscence in which Robert Peake's Bible illustrations are dragged back into the lime-light, but in a wider context than before, a context in which Laud is not even mentioned or implicated. Punning on his name, Sparke, he had earlier published a pamphlet called A Beacon Fired by Scintilla (i.e. Sparke) in which he had exposed, as he maintained, secret political plots of the Papists. Now he writes A Second Beacon Fired by Scintilla, '...discovering their wicked Designs to set up, advance, and cunningly to usher in Popery: By introducing Pictures to the Holy Bible'. Sparke, warming to his work, tells a moral tale about the awful fate of one who dealt in Bible pictures, who found the financial profit that he made by these pictures filthy lucre indeed: 'I am a Stationer and a wholesaleman, and I so professe my self and have dealt in Books above 40 years for my self, my first master when I was Apprentice, dealt much in Popish Books; and in the first year of King James reign, spent his time in Staffordshire in Worly-Hall in binding, vending, and putting to sale Popish Books, Pictures, Beads, and such Trash: there I learned to abhorre Popery by seeing the grosse ignorance of many among them ... In my trading in divers parts, I found how all my Chapmen were addicted, and dealing with some in Worcester, &amp;c. amongst the rest with one Francis Ash, a Book-binder and ingenious fellow, an excellent Workman, a strong and secret Papist. This man had from time to time written to me for divers Popish Books, and I always either put it by or evaded to furnish his Letter in that sort; and he being an excellent Workman, I employed him and got some friends to do the like, for he grew so famous in Bristoll, Glocester, Shrewsbury, Hereford and many places, especially with all the Papists in Worcestershire, and having got intimation with most of the greatest Papists was in a manner Agent for them, got good sums of money, and was greatly preferred of all, for Popish Books, Pictures, and the like; and found an extraordinary trade, especially to joyn pictures to the English Bible in 8vo. which pictures he had from Mr Robert Peake, (who after went to Basing-house) so that Mr Ash after took a voyage to France for Popish Books, and pictures for the Bible, which the Papists so much extolled, so that now the Papists orlate will have Bibles in English, and the Pope cannot avoid it, but so that all their sorts must have 184</page><page sequence="13">pictures, and I fear Popish notes: and by this means Ash grew into an extraordinary way to get Trade; I am credibly informed there, that in France he dealt for the pictures of all the Popish sorts, and the most excellent as of Vandikes Draft, and there bargained with an excellent Workman Mr Hollard to engrave and cut them and gave a piece of money in hand to begin withall, and they were there begun, and divers proffers made of them since. But after Ash came home, having by Papists got a good considerable summe of money in his hand, and the King coming to Worcester, and the Parliament beseiging it' (this I take to be the campaign of 1642) 'Ash fearing to be plundered, flung the said money into a house of Office among the filth, and after that Worcester was taken by the parliaments Forces about 14 days, he would trust none but himself, who breaking open the House of Office, undertook to sift his gold and silver from the Filth; by reason of which noysome smell he was suffocated, and (as I may say) poysoned, and soon after dyed.../52 If we can believe Michael Sparke, there was a papistical focus of activity in picture Bibles in the West Country before 1642, probably a good while before 1642, involving the use of Peake's prints and a large importation by a clever active trader of other prints, attributed generally to Van Dyck and specifically to Hollar. We can illustrate exactly this scale of activity in picture Bibles in Huntingdonshire in the 1630's, in the books manufactured at Little Gidding by the Ferrars and the Collets, a 'Fryer- like Familie' as their Puritan critics called them. These extraordinary books, the Little Gidding Concordances, and their relation to the taste and misfortunes of Archbishop Laud, are the subject of the second part of this study. Part 2: The Little Gidding Concordances Nicholas Ferrar, the genius of the Little Gidding enterprise, was born in 1592.53 He was a precocious child, attracted from his earliest years to the role and garb of a clergyman, like the Cistercian St Waltheof in another age.54 When he was fourteen he came up to Cambridge, to Clare Hall as it was then called, and established an excellent reputation in his society and the University for his ready tongue and pen, tenacious memory, and indefatigable industry. Having graduated M.A., he went abroad in 1613 for five years. In Germany he is reported to have shown an insatiable appetite for practical knowledge and mechanical skills. Despite this ingenious and gregarious turn of mind, he seems in fact not to have been a very lucky or very resilient traveller. In a crowded gallery in Rome during Holy Week 1615 or 1616 he alone, perhaps inadvertently, failed to kneel as Pope Paul V came past, and was forcibly 'suppressed' by a Swiss Guard. A devoted biographer reports that he felt the bruise for a week. He took to journeying with his rapier in his hand. In Spain, in 1618, short of money and homesick, he resolved to end his travels. Safe back in England, he embarked through established family connections on a career combining 185</page><page sequence="14">business and politics in London, playing a zealous influential part in the affairs of the Virginia Company up to the revocation of its patent by King James in 1624.55 In 1625 at the canonical age of thirty-three he retired from the world, taking with him his formidable mother, then aged seventy-four, his elder but very biddable brother John, also John's son, the younger Nicholas, his sister and her husband John Collet, with their numerous children, and some other dependents, about thirty persons. William Laud ordained him a deacon in 1626. At Little Gidding Manor house and church this family or commune gave itself up to devotions and charitable works and experiments in local education, as well as to communal readings, rote learning and book making. The books that they made are the well-known Little Gidding Concordances or scriptural harmonies - well-known in some respects that is, although their art historical affiliations and implications have not to my knowledge been assessed.56 In Old St Paul's Cathedral on Christmas Day, 1621, John Donne preached a sermon on the truth of the Scriptures as the word of God, citing as evidence 'the Majesty of the Style, the punctuall accomplishment of the Prophecies, the harmony and concurrence of the foure Evangelists...'57 The compiling of Gospel concordances or harmonies to emphasise the consistency of the Evangelists' testimony has been from the earliest times a preoccupation of Christian scholars. There was a surge of interest in such harmonies in Lutheran Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The so-called 'second Martin', Martin Chemnitz, second only to Martin Luther for his definition of Lutheran beliefs, undertook a Gospel harmony; left unfinished at his death in 1586, it was completed by another notable Lutheran theologian, Johann Gerhard of Jena, in 1626. Directly stimulated by this work a Cambridge man, Henry Garthwait, busied himself with his Monotessaron, 'The Evangelicall Harmonie, Reducing the foure Evangelists into one continued context'. These things make turgid reading because they are additive and repetitious. In Garthwait's Harmony, for example, when St Peter is challenged and questioned in the courtyard during Jesus's trial, we have a superfluity of maids saying 'You were one of them...', and the story ends very limply, through verbal duplication: 'And he went out (Mark) and wept (Matthew) and wept bitterly'. Buck and Daniel published Garthwait's Harmony in Cambridge in 1634, and there is contemporary evidence that Nicholas Ferrar was eagerly awaiting a copy.58 He himself some years previously had begun to design Gospel Concordances. The Little Gidding Concordances carry the title: 'The Actions &amp; Doctrine &amp; other passages touching our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ as they are related by the foure Evangelists, reduced to one complete body of historie...' They were manufactured out of multiple copies of the Gospels purchased in various editions, which were cut to pieces, verse by verse snipped out, by Ferrar' s nieces, the Collet girls, and then laboriously pieced together again in their revised order, pasted and pressed on to sheets of stout white paper in the Concordance Room in 186</page><page sequence="15">Little Gidding Manor house, a room decorated with a selection of appropriate mottoes such as 'Innocency is never better lodged then at the signe of Labor' and 'The Industrious man hath noe leasure to sinn*. The title of these Concordances concludes with the words '... to which are added sundry pictures, expressing either the facts themselves, or their types &amp; figures'. It is these pictures that make the Little Gidding Concordances exceptional. The Concordances are illustrated with engravings, first cut out like the texts, and then patched together, an operation that by comparison justifies the dismissal of the notorious Hanrott scrapbooks (out of which Margaret Rickert reconstructed the Carmelite Missal) as 'mere childish busy work'.59 The Collets' painstaking techniques are the sublimation of scissors and paste, the art of découpage at its highest, before that art is generally acknowledged to exist. At first they simply cut out and remounted entire prints,60 but very soon their schemes of illustration grew more ambitious, often employing more than one print or part of a print per page, and carefully excising from duplicate prints images or objects required to compile other illustrations. As well as the finished books themselves, unmounted cuttings survive that vividly convey their working methods. For example two sheep have been removed from a Marten de Vos design of the Last Judgement to serve some other role elsewhere. The purse on the thigh of a charitable man in another de Vos design has been filched from him, as we can tell by comparing the mutilated print with an unmutilated duplicate. A de Vos Agony in the Garden has had Christ cut out of it, but the cut-out part was carefully preserved pending some other use of it. These examples of excisions come from among a large number of loose prints in the Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Some others in the same series of loose prints were mounted in 1910 in an album, designed to match Pepys' own albums of prints and drawings as 'vol. Ill* to his series of 'Prints General' and shelved accordingly. These loose prints have therefore been included in the recent third volume of the Catalogue of the Pepys Library as belonging to Pepys.61 They are all religious in character. The Pepys Librarian, Mr Robert Latham, has kindly discussed these prints with me - the specific damage that they have sustained (PL 7), and the occasional annotations (of a devotional character) on the back of some of them, and he is inclined to agree with me that they should in fact be disassociated from the prints in Pepys' own collection and regarded rather as the Ferrar cuttings referred to by A. C. Benson, Master of Magdalene, in the address that he prepared for the tercentenary celebrations at Little Gidding in July 1925, as having been bequeathed to the College by Peter Peckard, Ferrar's biographer.62 The engravings used by the Ferrars and Collets reflect that period of European culture that appears to have gripped their imaginations most, the struggle between the forces of the Reformation and of the Counter Reformation in Europe, especially in the Netherlands. One of their heroes was the Emperor Charles V, whose abdication in 1555-56, a voluntary renunciation of the supreme pomps of this world, was the model to them 187</page><page sequence="16">in their own rejection of temporal values. Charles V was made the subject of one of the long dialogues in the Little Gidding Story Books, composed by Nicholas Ferrar for semi-dramatic reading or recitation by members of the community.63 The larger illustrations used in the Concordances are mostly of mid- to late-sixteenth century date, exhibiting the rhetorical manner of those Dutch and Flemish artists who absorbed and developed the High Renaissance and Mannerist styles of Italy, Marten van Heemskerck who was in Italy in the 1530's and died at Haarlem in 1574; Jan van der Straet, Latinised as Johannes Stradanus (1527-1605), in his day the leading foreign artist in Florence; likewise Marten de Vos, who returned from Italy to Antwerp in the 1560's and died there in 1603. Pieter Breughel and many others make occasional appearances.64 The atmosphere at Little Gidding was edifying, but perhaps a little constrained. Immediately before his death in 1637 Nicholas Ferrar peremptorily ordered his brother John 'with some vehemency and passion of indignation* to destroy the contents of three large locked hampers full of books in various languages, evidently comedies, tragedies, love hymns, heroic poems, and books of tales and novels, with which he now expressed himself disgusted, as undermining religion, corrupting and polluting their reader, carrying his soul down to Hell. He sounds like William Prynne, denouncing the theatres in his Histriomastix, published four years earlier. The hampers were burnt forthwith, on the site selected by Nicholas for his own grave, and the conspicuous bonfire at the Manor house convinced people in the surrounding fields and villages that Master Ferrar was burning his conjuring-books and could not die till they were all consumed. Thus Nicholas, despite his considerable good works, evidently had a sinister reputation among the local population.65 Like many men of powerful religious vocation, he reports himself much troubled in mind, prone to perpetual combats and temptations. He exercised himself spiritually in long night vigils at Little Gidding. In the Concordance Room he set his nieces the task of selecting and pasting in powerful images of the life and sufferings of Christ and his saints, and other narratives. A typical illustration, inserted in a great Gospel Concordance dated 1635, now in the British Library, is one of a set of six engravings by Herman Müller after Gerard Grönning, representing the Parable of the Idle Servant, St Matthew's Gospel, XXIV, who hid his talent instead of investing it and was consequently condemned to 'outer darkness and gnashing of teeth' (PL 8). It is interesting to think that this is how Milton could have envisaged the Parable, when he wrote in the 1650's in the ode On His Blindness: 'And that one Talent which is death to hide,/Lodg'd with me useless...' At any rate this brutal dungeon scene is the exact visual equivalent to the character of many of the dramatic meditations about the saints and martyrs in the Little Gidding Story Books. Nicholas Ferrar himself had been brought up on Foxe's Martyrs.66 The actors in these Little Gidding dialogues took names prophetic of Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, 'The Guardian', 'The Patient', 'The Obedient'. On an evening of conscious abstinence, one of the Collet girls, cast in the role of 'The 188</page><page sequence="17">CheerfulP, after a rather lingering condemnation of gluttony, regales the assembled household with the history of St Lawrence. She calls him 'rost meat for our souls to feed on... He who lies broyling on a Grid-iron in others eyes, lies in his own conceit upon a bed of pleasure'.67 There is much dwelling on racks and iron combs and scalding liquors. I make this point to emphasise the commitment of the compilers of the Concordances to their pictorial illustration, like the commitment of the Jesuits to the paintings of martyrs in San Stephano Rotondo.68 The illustrations are not mere incidental additions. They are an essential part of the spiritual gratification that the Concordances were intended to provide. Occasionally the compilers can be seen responding personally to the text, for example to Acts XXI, 9, where mention is made of a man who had four daughters, Virgins, which did prophesy'. The Collets found and cut out and pasted in four assorted nuns, which it may not be too fanciful to see as spiritual portraits of some of themselves and of their grandmother, Mary Ferrar. Various authorities on the Concordances assert that Nicholas Ferrar collected the engravings used to illustrate them during his youthful travels, when he is assumed also to have collected the books, afterwards burnt.69 At the end of the seventeenth century a great English collector, Samuel Pepys, despatched his nephew John Jackson on a tour of Europe in search of prints, but Pepys himself had already for many years frequented the print-sellers' shops in London, Faithorne's and Daniel's and Jenner's and Cade's. In Nicholas Ferrar's time there was Robert Peake, Faithorne's master, to patronise, if not also the ubiquitous Francis Ash. The increased complexity of the Concordances and the element of destructiveness of prints must surely have forced the Ferrars and Collets to seek out more and more potential illustrations. The draft of a letter, not hitherto noticed, survives on the back of an engraving of the Visitation by Stradanus in the Pepys Library.70 1 suppose the writer to be a member of the Little Gidding community. He requests a book- or print-seller to supply him with an engraving by Stradanus of the Annunciation to Zacharias in the Temple: 'This Booke of Stradens of the Stroy [sic] of the Gospell But espetially that [,] if to be had [,] a lim of the Angeli appeiring to Zakerias and if none of that of Stradens to be had then you must Send me the Booke of that of Christ Acting in the tempell it is in Architecture manner black prints you Sent one of the Bookes which I returned having the same booke by me But coming now to peruse it I find wanting the First leafe of Story the Angeli Coming to Zakerias and he Coming out to the Pepull and could not Speake; if you Can not helpe me to that Singill Picture which is only that I want of the whole Booke then you must Send me the whole Booke Alsoe I shall have occasion to use more of that kind of Story and very picture if there be many other that have graven it after many other Formes the more variety the better in this and all other for my turne for they are of greate helpes when they are different kinds and formes both smaler and greter: This I pray observe in all Pictures you send me Variety in the same kind and Story the better'. This is new evidence, I believe, that the prints were not all acquired by Nicholas abroad in prophetic 189</page><page sequence="18">anticipation of the later Concordances. Samuel Pepys found his compulsive taste for prints worrying to his purse and conscience: '...did buy two books of cities stitched together, cost me 9s. 6d.y and when I came home thought of my vo we and paid 55. into my poor-box for it...' In view of the likely expenditure by Nicholas Ferrar on the luxury of prints, his letter rebuffing, on grounds of necessarily strict domestic economy, a desperate plea for a loan, addressed to his mother by the black sheep of the family, his brother Richard, reads somewhat callously.71 After Nicholas's death John Ferrar openly hoped that 'noble and learned persons could be found, who might be willing to cast away their money' on the books that Nicholas had insisted they should continue to manufacture as part of the regimen at Little Gidding: '...about their Concordances (&amp; the New Devise way of printing, as some termed it) he sayd, he would have them to keep &amp; preserve the thing, &amp; the Pictures. For (sayd he) I hope God will send you wayes and meanes, &amp; helps to go forward with them, &amp; you may grow to perfection of something, by such helps, as God will send. Leave not the thoughts of them, tho' I be gone...'72 John Ferrar's anxiety for clients was long after these books, in happier times, had first attracted the attention of the noblest in the kingdom, King Charles himself. As John Ferrar records, 'His sacred majesty' (this is perhaps as early as 1631) 'having heard of some rare contrivements, as he was pleased to term them, of books done at Little Gidding ... sent a gentleman of his court' to borrow a Gospel concordance, probably the volume now in Harvard University Library, was slow to return it, reputedly read it every day, and 'would upon no terms part with it, except he brought him a promise from the family, that they would make him one for his daily use'. That book, dated 1635, is the great Concordance preserved in the British Library.73 It was carried up to London, a folio volume stiff with cuttings, and presented to the King. 'The king graciously with a cheerful countenance received it: and after a curious perusal, after having asked many questions concerning the work, and the parties that had done it, said to the lord's grace of Canterbury', (William Laud) 'and divers other lords that stood about him.... Truly my lords, I prize this as a rare and rich jewel, and worth a king's acceptance. The substance of it is of the best alloy in the world, and ought to be the only desirable book. And for the skill, care, cost, used in it, there is no defect, but a superlative diligence in all about it... Then he gave the book to the lords to peruse, saying, there are fine pictures in it. The lords said, they believed the like book was not in the world to be seen. It was a precious gem, and worthy of his cabinet'.74 So the visual taste that the Concordance displayed was very much the King's taste too. The Collets' dexterity and capacity for taking pains, their 'painful hands' praised by the King, are impressively displayed in the illustration of 'the lilies of the field' in the Sermon on the Mount on pages 127-8. A huge sheaf of engraved flowers is pasted in, inhabited by caterpillars and visited by bees, the delicate outlines and details miraculously unimpaired by the process of excision.75 The Collets were particularly stimulated when a 190</page><page sequence="19">variety of verbal images quickly follow one another in the teachings of Christ. Literal illustration is, of course, a feature of the 16th century prints that they employed, for example the beam in the eye of the hypocrite, again in the Sermon on the Mount, is physically present, floating fantastically in the air in Ambrosius Francken's print pasted on pages 131- 2. But when Christ sends out the twelve Apostles as sheep in the midst of wolves, instructing them to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves, the Collet girls brought together on pages 183-4 a patchwork of sheep and pigeons, coiling snakes, and wolves robbed from one of their favourite prints, de Vos's design of the Faithful Shepherd. A burst of visual equivalents accompanies Christ's teaching in Luke IX, 58-62, combined harmony-wise with Matthew VIII, 20-22. The dead bury their dead with a funeral procession moving up the page, the mourners following a hearse to a church at the top, while Christ's comment that 'foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath no where to lay his head' set the Collets cutting out and pasting in every bird and fox or wolf and hens and chickens and birds flying to nests that they could get their hands on. Partly responsible for the often bizarre effect of these pages is the juxtaposition of radically discrepant sizes of engraving of the same subject, a large and a small tempest scene at page 80, a large and a small version of the healing of Simon Peter's mother-in-law on pages 69-70, illustrating the range of visual material deliberately sought by the writer of the draft letter in the Pepy s Library quoted above. It is ironical to find Archbishop Laud and his fellow courtiers reported as believing 'the like book was not in the world to be seen'. Laud lived to wish that it was so indeed, or at least that its humbler relations were not so readily available. For the backbone of the King's great Concordance, the store of smaller pictures that move the Gospel story onwards, are the engravings of the life of Christ by Boethius Bolswert, many of them furnished still with their Latin inscriptions. Even Bolswert's title-page itself is pasted in, the text portion having been cut out and replaced by an inserted engraving, in a rather earlier style, of the Crucifixion. This title- page appears as one of no less than twenty-one engravings (another is Bolswert's Christ kneeling to receive the instruments of the Passion), arranged in phalanxes like a seventeenth century picture-gallery, on the single opening of the Concordance, pages 33 to 36. One general modication, however, was made with scissors and paste to the Bolswert designs before they were regarded as fit for the King's eyes. John Ferrar records a sentiment of his brother, That he wholy disliked, to have the Picture of God, to be made or used in any place or thing, saying, It was a breach of the 2:d Commandment, to make any such Resemblance'.76 So every image of God the Father in Bolswert's engravings, in the Annunciation on pages 13-14, the Baptism of Christ on pages 41-42, and in the Curse of the Fig Tree on pages 377-378, is snipped out and neatly filled in by means of cuttings from engravings of clouds. In a second appearance of the Fig Tree on pages 381-382 God the Father is replaced by the Hebrew name of God. In this particular matter it would of course have been much 191</page><page sequence="20">more convenient for the Collets to use Robert Peake's copies of the Bolswert originals, since he specifically edits out the offensive imagery of God the Father. The superior quality of the Bolswert originals may perhaps have persuaded the Collets to use Bolswerťs engravings in the King's copy, although it is difficult to ascribe to them much aesthetic sensibility. Probably at this stage the Peake copies had not yet been made. But as soon as might be, the Little Gidding community took to patronising Robert Peake. Peake's Gospel prefaces and Gospel scenes, with English texts below, form the backbone of a lesser Concordance, also in the British Library, tentatively placed in 1636 by the British Library's Catalogue of printed books, but perhaps somewhat earlier.77 The opening page unites all four of Peake's Evangelist Author portraits, the Matthew print carrying his 'to be soulď inscription, and places in the centre of the page Peake's 'Eyckian' seated Virgin with the child Christ (PL 9). For this book the Collets extended the range of available illustrations by splicing together different portions of engravings. This system is seen in their illustration of Christ at the house of Levi on pages 28-29, in the company of a great gathering of Publicans. At first glance it seems a normal illustration, but on closer scrutiny anomalous details are apparent - curious small faces and part of a chair crowded in near Christ's elbow (Pi. 10). This portion of the design, in fact, together with the row of foreground figures seated on a curved bench, was cut out of a print of the child Christ disputing with the doctors in the Temple, while the rest of the Levi scene is a portion of Peake's 'Supper at Bethany' illustration, from which the figure of the woman annointing Christ's head has been removed (Pis. 11 &amp; 12). The unmodified print of Christ disputing with the doctors occurs elsewhere in the Concordance, proving the Collets' need for multiple copies of prints. Such were the clumsy devices employed by amateur Bible illustrators in the age of prints and printing! What a medieval miniaturist could supply with ease, has to be coaxed into shape in seventeenth century England by raids into a store of ready-made engravings. On pages 17-18 the central scene of St John the Baptist seized and incarcerated has no prior existence and is a compilation of barely coherent parts. On the other hand, the scene of St John testifying to the priests and Levites, in the left column, is recognisably, in spite of the added English text, No. 14 in Marten de Vos's St John the Baptist series which we have already found pasted into the British Bible Society's copy of Robert Barker's 1634 New Testament. On pages 35-36 Peake's illustration of Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount, the lower half only, is placed in the middle column of the page below a splendid set of full length Apostles engraved by Theodore Galle, each with an article of the Creed inscribed beneath his feet and illustrated in the background. The upper half of Peake's Sermon on the Mount, with illustrations of the content of the Sermon in inset roundels, appears in the middle column on pages 37- 38, with more of the full-length Apostles above. These figures of the Apostles are exactly the same designs, although much more strongly 192</page><page sequence="21">executed, as the Apostles with martyrdom scenes behind pasted into Barker's 1634 New Testament.78 It comes as no surprise that the Little Gidding community shared with Peake his interest in portraits of the Apostles. The original engravings of heads of Apostles in roundels, which Peake copied (in reverse) for his first standard series of Acts or Epistles illustrations, were placed by the Collets over the narrative of the Last Supper on pages 133-136 of the British Library's lesser Concordance. These are of course the kind of prints that Robert Peake and other print-sellers would have in stock for sale to any interested clients. I wonder, however, if the Ferrars/Collets were not rather special patrons, who might on occasion affect the character of the prints made available for sale? After all, they used a great many of them, employing whole prints and assorted portions of the same prints in disguised rearrangements. As we have seen, Peake was not encouraged to remove the Jesuitical I H S monogram with the cross above and nails below when he prepared his copy of Bolswert's Circumcision print. The I H S monogram was particularly favoured at Little Gidding. Nicholas Ferrar and his family headed every sheet of their correspondence with it, and every page of the Little Gidding Story Books.79 I H S with a cross superimposed was displayed in the Great Parlour, the chief public room of Little Gidding Manor house, on the chimney piece above a short set of earnest remonstrances erected on a board or table by old Mrs Ferrar. Curious visitors reported this feature of the domestic and devotional life of the community, and it was made much of in a Puritan tract, published after Laud's arrest in 1641, attacking the faith and practises of the inmates of the 'late erected Monasticall place, called the Arminian Nunnery at Little Gidding'.80 The I H S monogram and the texts on Mrs Ferrar's table are reproduced in this tract. Alarmed for the safety of the family, especially for Ferrar's 'virgin nieces, his great care', the bishop of the diocese, Bishop Williams, visited them in 1641 and advised them '...to take this down, and let it not hang in this public room any longer'. The Ferrars/Collets would certainly have been satisfied purchasers of Peake's Circumcision print, and indeed it makes its appearance on pages 7-8 of the British Library's lesser Concordances (PL 13). Visually the most impressive of the Little Gidding books, other than the great royal Concordance itself, is the British Library's copy of the Acts of the Apostles and The Book of Revelation}1 In Revelation the main sequence of illustrations is supplied by a mediocre set of Apocalypse engravings by Pieter van der Borcht, but in the opening chapters, containing the letters to the Seven Churches, and in the similarly moral and didactic final chapter, verses and sometimes even phrases are illustrated with violently juxtaposed images, large and small, excised with great skill from a heterogeneous selection of prints (PL 14). At the end of the volume the piling up of the pictorial images and the scattered and staccato presentation of the text achieves a kind of power and strangeness not unbecoming to The Book of Revelation. The material drawn on by the Ferrars/Collets ranges from an engraving of the miraculous transportation 193</page><page sequence="22">of the Little House of Loretto, ingeniously used to illustrated chapter XXI, 3, 'Ecce Tabernaculum Dei cum Hominibus', to something much nearer home, the title-page of one of Robert Barker's Bibles, probably his 1608 printing of the Geneva translation, from which the shields of the twelve tribes of Israel have been cut out and re-ordered, to illustrate the reference to the twelve tribes in Revelation VII, 4-8. 82 The illustrations in the first part of this volume, in The Acts of the Apostles, brings us back to the question of Robert Peake's Bible pictures, his sources, and his clients and patrons. According to the testimony offered by the stationers at Laud's trial, the Bible pictures which Laud was accused of negotiating with Peake were printed for Peake in 1638. Peake had probably made his Gospel scenes by about 1636, since they were freely employed to illustrate the British Library's lesser Concordance, a book made at Little Gidding for home consumption, either as a trial run for the King's presentation copy of 1635 or more probably as an immediate result of the experience of preparing the King's presentation copy. Furthermore I believe that the crucifixion scene used in the great Revelation volume to illustrate Revelation chapter I, 7, is Peake's engraving, not Bolswert's. I wonder if we might be justified in limiting the work actually done for Laud by Peake in 1638 to the preparation of the set of twelve scenes from The Acts of the Apostles} These appear to have been latecomers to Peake's repertoire of plates. Scenes from Acts, it seems, were among the illustrations to the New Testament that caused scandal first in London and then, from August 1638 onwards, in Edinburgh. Be that as it may, the raw materials out of which Peake made his set of Acts pictures were well known to the Ferrars/Collets and also to the King, for whom the sumptuous Little Gidding copy of Acts and Revelation must surely have been made, judging from the way it exactly matches the great royal Concordance in scale and lay-out and ambitiousness. The illustrations to Acts are taken from several handsome series of prints, some designed by Marten de Vos, others by Stradanus, issued to complete another set, also represented here, designed by Marten van Heemskerck. The text of the title-page of the Little Gidding Acts was snipped out of the title-page of Heemskerck's set of prints, Acta Apostolorum elegantiss. monochromatis delineata. In addition Acts material was derived from a majestic series of views of the Temple in Jerusalem entitled Memorabilium Novi Testamenti Templo gestorům icones, published in Antwerp by Gerard de Jode. These last, which are impressive dark architecture-dominated prints, I take to be from 'the Booke... of Christ Acting in the tempell it is in Architecture manner black prints' requested by the author of the draft letter in the Pepys Library quoted above. In the Little Gidding volume of Acts, chapter XXVI, St Paul's trial before King Agrippa, is illustrated with a print designed by Stradanus. The conspicuous figure of a court dwarf in attendance in the throne room helps to place the scene firmly in the second half of the sixteenth century. To produce the composition in Peake's little Bible illustration the simple 194</page><page sequence="23">device has been adopted of chopping off the outer edges of Stradanus's rectangular print, much the same basic surgery that we encounter in some of the Little Gidding Gospel illustrations. The magnificent design, also by Stradanus, of the deliverance of Paul and Silas from prison at Thyatira, with the keeper about to commit suicide, in the Little Gidding Acts, has similarly been halved in Peake's edition (PL 15). The scene of SS. Peterand John healing the lame man at the Gate Beautiful, Acts III, is a rather more complicated case. The eloquent figures tally well with the figures in a version of the subject after de Vos in the Little Gidding Acts, except that Peake has made Peter take hold of the lame beggar's hand to raise him (Pis. 17, 18). However Peake's architectural setting is quite different. Nothing has happened to the shape or proportions of the composition, but the Temple is redesigned. We see curved shell-like steps, a floor of long slabs within the Temple, and a bird in the curved pediment above the door. The de Vos print is on the recto of the Little Gidding Acts, and when we turn to the verso we find there another print of the same subject, one of de Jode's Temple series (Pi. 16). This second version, entitled Argentum et aurum non est mihi... and ending with Peter's command, surge et ambula, shows St Peter taking the beggar's hand. It was this print that provided the model for the architecture against which Peake superimposed de Vos's figures. One could produce roughly the effect of Peake's illustration by cutting out the figures from the one print and pasting them on to the other. Samuel Pepy s wrote to his nephew in Rome in February 1699/1700 instructing him: '... in your visiting of churches to try whether you can recollect enough of my perspective in my dining parlour to finde what particular churches it is made up of; the paynter I bought it of ... telling mee it was a capricio of his owne, made up out of 2 or 3 different churches. I should bee glad to know what'.83 This is very much one's feeling about Peake's Acts designs. In illustrating the deliverance of St Peter from prison, Acts XII, Robert Peake moved away from the grandiloquent style displayed in the Stradanus illustration pasted into the Little Gidding copy of the Acts, with its prison- bars reference to Raphael's famous version of the subject in the Heliodorus Chamber in the Vatican. Peake here takes an interesting jump into the seventeenth century, into Elsheimer's circle, by choosing as model a concentrated monumental and naturalistic design engraved after Jan Pynas, a composition which Rembrandt admired (Pis. 19 &amp; 20). 84 In this illustration by Peake we have to do with a humble reflection of up-to-the- moment European art. The Pynas design is taken over without change. Peake reverted to his artificial compilation of sources, as is clear from the very unequal quality of the contents of the scene, for his illustration of the Baptism of the Eunuch by St Philip, Acts VIII (Pi. 21). This is nothing like Heemskerck's elegant and dramatic version used to illustrate the Little Gidding Acts, in which we watch the almost cinematic progress through the countryside of the Eunuch's chariot, marking the very process of his conversion by St Philip's persuasive gloss of Isaiah LIII, 7-8. In Peake's version, compared with the wooden-looking stereotyped guards and the 195</page><page sequence="24">little horses, and the landscape like a stage-set in a puppet theatre, Peake's finely conceived kneeling foreshortened Eunuch conveys a different atmosphere altogether. We can recognise him in a copy of a lost Rembrandt painting of the Baptism of the Eunuch, of around 1630, and from an etching, reversing the composition, by J. G. van Vliet.85 The taste exhibited in Peake's Eunuch is the same taste as in the Pynas-derived Escape of St Peter. The other, archaic, components of Peake's composition are equally traceable. They were borrowed, even including the scimitar and turban lying on the ground, from the engraving of the Baptism of the Eunuch by the Swiss engraver Matthias Merian (PL 23), one of his large number of New Testament illustrations that accompany the text of Luther's German Bible published in Strassburg in 1630.86 In 1627 Wenceslaus Hollar was apprenticed to Merian.87 Hollar was in England by the end of 1636. 1 have quoted the evidence of Michael Sparke that Hollar was implicated in the engravings of the Bible pictures traded in by Francis Ash in association with Robert Peake. Could there be a grain of truth in Sparke's allegation? George Vertue placed Hollar beside Peake at the seige of Basing House. Again in the composition of the Eunuch scene we see various shifts and re-arrangements. The guards and the horses change places. It is only when we reverse the Merian engraving that we recognise that the mountain and the woody landscape are reproduced exactly in Peake's copy in their reversed position, whereas the figures are equally copied but not reversed. Peake's illustration of Paul and Barnabas at Lystra, Acts XIV, derives certain specific elements from the Merian Bible version, namely the figure of St Paul himself, the pillared portico, the distant scene of the pagan procession offering their votive gifts to the Apostles, and also the leaf and the stone lying in the right hand corner of the picture. But these features are conflated with others, borrowed from the equivalent scene designed by Stradanus and displayed in the King's copy of Acts from Little Gidding, namely the figure of Barnabas, in profile, and the cripple whom the Apostles cure, crouching with his mis-shapen legs beside his cart, his hand- supports discarded in front of him. The twelfth and last of the A cts scenes, the incident of St Paul and the viper reproduces the design of the engraving in the Merian Bible, but reverses the composition. Only one of the Peake Acts illustrations accepts Merian's model without any modification or disguise, other than the customary one of paring it at the edges, namely the scene of the Death of Ananias, Acts V (Pis. 22 &amp; 24). King Charles who owned the ultimate original of this design, Raphael's Tapestry Cartoon, might have particularly favoured the adoption of this composition by Peake, as a loyal compliment to his enlightened patronage.88 We see, therefore, that the Acts illustrations whose launching into Scotland in 1638 was so ill-timed, were derived from imported, some very recently imported, fashionable models. Many of the pictorial sources on which they drew are represented in the King's own copy of Acts from Little Gidding, and whoever was responsible for putting them in their evolved form into Bibles, and responsible in the first place for conflating the 196</page><page sequence="25">various images, seems likely enough to have been known to the King or guess-at-able at any rate, in spite of the blank denial of all knowledge and involvement made in the King's Large Declaration of 1639. Laud too was well aware of these model designs, if not on his own account, then as a sycophant of the King.89 Along with very many other apparently proven accusations, the crime of promoting the Bible illustrations brought Archbishop Laud to the block on January 10th, 1645. In his sermon before his execution he likened his fate to that of St John the Baptist, who 'had his head danced off by a lewd woman'.90 Prints of the history, imprisonment and death of the Baptist are abundantly displayed in the Little Gidding Concordances and in Young and Barker's Bibles of the period, and it is easy to visualise Laud's phrase in terms of designs by Marten de Vos and his contemporaries. On the other hand, Laud's triumphant enemies identified him, in a sermon preached in riposte to his own last sermon, with a quite different Bible character. One Joshua Hoyle, Minister of the Gospel, preached a sermon in 1645 entitled Jehojadah's Justice Against Mattan, Baal's Priest, or the Covenanter's Justice against Idolaters91 - the text is 2nd Chronicles, XXIII, 16-17, 'And Jehojadah made a Covenant between him and the people, and between the King, that they should be the Lord's people. Nationall mercies should draw a people to renew a Covenant with their God. God's Covenant will not admit communion with idolatry or idolators. They act according to Covenant light, Covenant strength, Covenant zeal! So they go to Baal's house. What did they do at the house of Baal? They did not gaze about, lamenting and crying that a thing of that cost should in one instant be demolished. That was a posture now fit for Babylonish merchants. But they set to work with all their might, first to demolish the house, next to execute the priest. The house they brake down and the altars and images to pieces. The priest they slew before the Altars, that were the delectable things of his heart ... A people covenanting for Reformation must abolish all that is idolatrous'. These sentiments of Hoyle are exactly the sentiments of the Scots Covenanters. In 1640 they accused Laud of negotiating 'for Rome against the Reformed Kirks, to reduce them to the Heresies in Doctrine... the Superstitions and Idolatry in worship... which are in that See'.92 I referred at the beginning of this study to the destruction of the Ruth well Cross in 1642. An act 'anent the abolition of idolatrous monuments' in Scotland was drawn up in 1640, and in 1642 an Assembly at St Andrews urged the destruction specifically of the Ruthwell Cross. If anyone needed confirmation that the Ruthwell Cross was idolatrous, there were Peake's and Bolswert's 'abominable' Bible pictures at hand to provide chapter and verse. The comparison of book illustrations with suspect and offending works of art is well attested in the records of Laud's trial, where page references to pictures in his Missal are cited in respect of the typological windows that he was accused of placing in his chapel in Lambeth Palace.93 So we might link the scene of St Mary Magdalene at Christ's feet, with the Lucan Latin text inscribed in the Bolswert version, 197</page><page sequence="26">with the same scene and inscribed text at Ruthwell; also Christ in the rest after the Temptation, with the great crouching lion at his right hand (PL 5), compared with Christ's cohabitation with the beasts in the desert at Ruthwell; even the two journeys of the Virgin on donkey-back may be compared, since narrative images, especially involving the Virgin, probably gave no less offence than symbolic or hieratic art. In the records of Laud's trial it is affirmed: 'Images and idolatry go always both together, as a shadow followeth the body when the sun shineth...'94 The cultural world that engendered the Ruthwell Cross in the eighth century impinged perceptibly on Little Gidding in the seventeenth century. Selections from Bede's Ecclesiastical History, in Thomas Stapleton's translation, first published in Antwerp in 1565, and republished in St Omer in 1625, were prescribed reading for the Little Gidding community, and John Ferrar's story about his brother's right hand remaining miraculously pliable after his death, because it had been so active in alms-giving, shows a naive susceptibility to Bedan and indirectly to Irish hagiography.95 To balance this, we may suggest that the cultural world of Little Gidding, and what in its heyday in the 1630's it helped to engender in the creation and multiplication of cycles of illustrations in Bibles and New Testaments had an effect, in turn, on the fortunes of monuments such as the Ruthwell Cross, and inadvertently hastened its overthrow in the 1640's.

G. Ornsby, Surtees Society (1869), p. 127, Cosin remarks: 'This manner also of engraving it is somewhat different from that which the Jesuits use, with the signe of the crosse over it.

'The Booke of Common Prayer' in the same volume, printed by the same printers, has the date 1635. 38 Canterburies Doome lists books which Laud ordered to be printed, or otherwise countenanced: one of these is A. Stafford's The F email Glory: or, The life and death of our Blessed Lady (London, 1635). On p. 215 this book is described thus: 'Anthony Stafford in his F email Glory, (in the Front whereof there is the Picture of the Virgin Mary encompassed with a Glory holding Christ a little Infant in her Armes)....' and on p. 209, thus: 'There is the Picture of her fabulous assumption into heaven, cut in Brasse after the popish forme, with men and women devoutly kneeling and praying to her, and these verses written under the same...', the verses being those under Peake's engraving. Here evidently both designs are concurrent. In the copy of Stafford's book in Cambridge University Library (Syn.8.63.67) the Virgin with Child preface is not included.

Blackstone, p. 61, and I wo Lives, ed. Mayor, pp. 256-7. Peter Smart in his forthright sermon preached against John Cosin at Durham, entitled The Vanitie and Downe-Fall of Superstitious Popish Ceremonies (Edinburgh, 1628), p. 37, connects 'conjuring' and High Church observances: 'Againe Necromancers and Sorcerers turne their faces to the East, when they act their inchantments: and it little becomes Christians to follow Witches, and Coniurers, in their superstitious and divelish devotions, by preferring East before West....' The idea of conjuring books being burnt is derived from Acts XIX, 19, where Jews and Greeks at Ephesus, users of 'curious arts', bring their books together and burn them after Jewish exorcists are injured in a failed 201</page><page sequence="30">exorcism. The last minute repentance of the sorcerer, expressed by his burning his books, is familiar from the end of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus. The mystical sator square, cut on an octagonal wooden panel, in Great Gidding Church, which might well have puzzled the local peasantry, is before Nicholas Ferrar's time, being dated 1614, with the initials E.

Mayor, pp. 115-7. 75 Donne perhaps provides us with a clue to the meaning of this plethora of natural forms applied to the Scriptures. In a sermon preached in April 1622 he speaks of the clearing away of the limitations of human knowledge at the Last Judgement: 'That great Library, those infinite Volumes of the Books of Creatures, shall be taken away, quite away, no more Nature; those reverend manuscripts, written with Gods own hand, the Scriptures themselves, shall be taken away, quite away; no more preaching, no more reading of the Scriptures... a flower that lives but a day, is an abridgment of that King, that lives out his three score and ten years; but I shall know too, that all these Ants, and Bees, and Flowers, and Kings, and Kingdoms, howsoever they may be Examples and Comparisons to one another, yet they are all as nothing, altogether nothing, less than nothing, infinitely less than nothing, to that which shall then be the subject of my knowledge, for, it is the knowledge of the glory of God*.

He records that the volume was Mary Collet's book, compiled by her at Little Gidding, by Nicholas Ferrar's direction. She evidently gave it to her younger sister, Hester Collet, perhaps on the occasion of her marriage in 1635. Hester's daughter Elizabeth Kestian evidently gave the book to her cousin John Mapletoft. An unillustrated Gospel Harmony was given by Mary Ferrar, Nicholas Ferrar, and the two elder Collet girls to another Collet daughter, Susanna, in 1631. That volume is also inscribed by John Mapletoft, and distinguished from what he calls 'the great Concordance'. He associates his great Concordance (termed in my paper, 'the lesser Concordance') with two others, one presented to Charles the First, and one presented to Charles the Second at his Restoration in 1660. The first of these is evidently B.L. C.23.e.4, not the Harvard volume. See The Story Books, ed. Sharland, pp. v-vii: li-lv: also Peckard, op. cit., pp. 273-4; Two Lives, ed. Mayor, pp. 293-4.

The Arminian Nunnery, p. 10, implicates Laud in the attitudes and activities of the community at Little Gidding: 'Surely we may marvell at the present Primate of all England and Metropolitane being the principali Governour of the Church, under his Sacred Majestie, and as hee professeth such an Anti-papist and enemy to superstition and Idolatry, should permit this Innovation, and connive at such canting betwixt the barke and the tree in matter of Religion: But by what hath been retailed of these Peoples practise, we see that position made good, that Arminianisme is a bridge to Popery Some have past over it: witness Preist Shelford, Preist Cozens, and this Familie in this Booke treated on, with divers others, and had 202</page><page sequence="31">not God of his great mercy undermin'd the chiefe Arches of that bridge, causing them to fall in the River of Confusion, we have cause to think that the greater part of this Land would also have followed the rest....' 81 B.L. C.23.e.3. 82 See C.U.L. Huntingdon 38.121, where the square format of the shields enclosed by tents, with the name of the tribe below, agrees exactly with those employed by the Ferrars/Collets. Robert Barker's title pages represent the shields of the twelve tribes including Dan. The list of the twelve tribes in Revelation XII excludes Dan but includes Manasses. With a characteristic eye for detail, the Ferrars/Collets have neatly excised the shield and name of Dan, the blank space standing for Manasses in sixth place among the pasted-in shields. 83 Catalogue of the Pepsy Library, III, Introduction, p. xvi.

Compare Rembrandt's use of a figure in an engraving after Raphael's cartoon of the Blinding of Elymas, in Münz, op. cit., No. 181, pp. 87-8. 89 John Ferrar represents King Charles, having received his 1635 Gospel Concordance, and an harmonised Kings and Chronicles, as communicating his pleasure by the agency both of Archbishop Laud and Dr Cosin, his chaplain. 'Some while after, doctor Cosins gave notice, that the King, the more he perused both books given him, the more he liked them: and had conference with him about the printing of them, that as he said, all his people might have the benefit of them. And doctor Cosins told the King it was a kingly notion, and by his Majesty's favour, they should be put out, as at his command....' Thus the King was interested in publicising and extending the audience of the Concordances. Laud praises the illustrated Concordance of Kings and Chronicles: 'Your expectations, Sir, are not only performed, but out of doubt many ways surpassed. For my own part, I wonder at the work and all the parts of it...' See Two Lives, ed. Mayor, pp. 120-1 and 127. For a negative view of Laud's aesthetic interest in images, see J.

A sermon 203</page><page sequence="32">preached by Dr Thomas Lawrence before the King at Whitehall in February 1636, printed by Richard Badger, 1637, in C.U.L. Acton d.8.255, quotes Bede's authority for prostration as a sign of Christian devotion: ' Adaman in Bede tells, in his discourse of holy places, from the mouth of a Bishop, who had been there: that in a Church erected in that place, from whence our Saviour ascended, there rushed annually in those times, a violent gale of winde from heaven upon Ascension Day, which forced all those found standing to fall prostrate on the earth. I doe not justify the relation, and yet tis ancient...' Other texts of Bede were employed by scholars, as Sir Robert Cotton's purloining of De Temporibus from St John's College, Oxford, proves. See Trevor- Roper, op. cit., p. 58. John Donne was critical of Bede, despising his narrative of visions of Purgatory, such as that of Fursey. See Ignatius His Conclave, in J. Donne, Complete Poetry and Selected Prose, ed. Hayward, p. 360.
