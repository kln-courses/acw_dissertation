<plain_text><page sequence="1">MIND CONSIDERED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BIOLOGY? Professor JULIAN S. HUXLEY The concept of evolution is of fundamental importance to any general scheme of thought: and one of the ways in which its importance is greatest is in defining the place of mind within any such scheme. If bodies and their contained brains have evolved, why not the accompanying minds ? Indeed, to-day the question can only be properly put the other way round : how can the minds not have evolved? Mental evolution can only have failed to occur if we deny to mind the principle of continuity, which is one of our axioms on the physical side: only, that is to say, if the world ceases to be rational. If we knew nothing of a nature intermediate between ourselves and rocks or clouds, it would be permissible to believe that human consciousness was in its essence unique, with no ties binding it to other objects of the material universe; and this attitude was still possible so long as the theory of special creation held the field. But with the demonstration that all life was one, and further, that it was a product of the one matter of which all objects in the universe are made, such a distinction was no longer possible. Through our knowledge of ourselves, mind and living matter are seen to be connected. Through our knowledge of evolution, mind is linked with all matter. It is therefore of considerable interest to look closely into the evolution of brain on the one hand, and of behaviour on the other. So far as we know, true conscious processes?nervous processes accompanying conscious psychical activity?are in man confined not only to the brain, but to a restricted part of it. In spite of the complexity of the spinal cord, and still more of the medulla and cerebellum, no process confined to these structures involves consciousness. Consciousness, so far as any experiments take us, is associated only with the fore-brain, and almost solely with the so-called cerebral cortex?the much-folded layer of grey matter covering the cerebral hemispheres. The essential part of this organ consists of millions upon millions of nerve-cells, each with a large number of branches, so 1 This article is to appear as part of the opening chapter of a book entitled The Mind; a collective work (Longmans, Green &amp; Co.), based upon a course of lectures given in 1927 in King's College, London. 330</page><page sequence="2">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY that in all probability any cell can be connected comparatively readily with any other cell. Different regions, each comprising huge numbers of cells, are associated with different functions and different psychic processes. In all probability, again, every con? scious process is associated with the activity not of one, but of a very great many cortical cells simultaneously. The nervous processes involved, although an extension of the reflex are principle, are strictly speaking not reflex. When an image is perceived, or recalled in consciousness, there need not be action : the reflex are is broken in its centre, and at the break thousands instead of tens of cell-junctions are brought into action. A high intensity of consciousness would only seem to be possible where there is this gap between stimulus and response, and where there is this new type of arrangement where a great number of connected cells are excited at one instant of time. The " lower " parts of the brain consist also of great numbers of branching cells and their prolongations. In these, although one of the two great functions of the cerebral cortex?consciousness? is absent, the other is still present?namely, the control and co? ordination of many activities of still lower parts of the nervous system, and, through them, of most of the simpler activities of the body as a whole. In the cerebellum, for instance, there is a co-ordination of most of the incoming and outgoing messages necessary for balance and the maintenance of posture; in the medulla is the centre for controlling the mechanism of breathing; and so forth. In the spinal cord, on the other hand, the main function is a simpler reflex activity. In an animal completely deprived of its brain, many stimuli will still provoke action, and action of an apparently purposive kind. Everyone has read of the activities of brainless frogs?they have found their way into all the text- books. But there is another experiment of the same nature which is more spectacular and whose performance at the same time may be regarded as a virtuous act. In the southern United States one of the most unpleasant animals is the copperhead?a poisonous and sluggish snake, so sluggish as often to allow itself to be trodden on, but not too sluggish then to bite. If you decapitate one of these, you will be doing a public service. In addition, you can study the physiology of the reptilian nervous system. Stretch the decapitated creature out in a straight line. So long as you do not touch it, it remains quiescent; but pinch the tail, and the headless animal will coil in its regular spiral and strike in the direction of the pinch. You may be perfectly aware of its head- lessness, but you will find it very hard not to draw your hand away! 331</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES There are touch-organs in the animal's skin; from these sensory nerves run to the spinal cord: there they are connected with the origins of various motor nerves; and these in their turn activate the museles concerned in coiling and striking. In other words, the performance of this particular set of actions is potentially given in something which the copperhead has inherited with the rest of his peculiarities?certain sense-organs, certain museles, and a particular arrangement of conducting paths, the nervous connec? tion, between the one and the other. It is given in just the same sort of way as the performances of a clockwork toy are potentially given in the construction of its clockwork mechanism. As we go down the animal scale, we find some very radical alterations in the nervous mechanism. In man the brain is large relative to the spinal cord, the cortex is large relative to the brain. As we go from higher to lower vertebrates, we find a decrease in the relative size, first of cortex and indeed of cerebral hemispheres, secondly of brain as a whole. Finally, in Amphioxus, which must be a comparatively close relative of the ancestor of all Vertebrates, there is nothing to which the word brain can properly be applied? only a forward section of the nerve-cord slightly modified in connection with the receiving of messages from the specially sensitive front end of the animal. Essentially the same is true for all the other great groups of animals which have reached high degrees of nervous specialization ?the Molluscs, the Crustacea, the Spiders, and the Insects. In the lower members of all we find a nervous system consisting of cords of nerve-like fibres (the conducting cables) connecting swellings or ganglia which contain nerve-cells (the exchanges); and the ganglia of the head-region scarcely differ from those of other regions. The whole system is built upon the reflex are principle. Further, nervous evolution consists in the enlargement and fusion of a number of the most anterior of the ganglia to form a mass of nervous matter usually larger than any other in the body, different in its general structure, and with some sort of controlling function over the remainder of the nervous system?in other words, a brain, in which the reflex principle is gradually modified to that of association centres and multiple excitation seen in the cortex. There is then a certain general grade of animal organization, attained not only by the simplest Vertebrates (Chordates), Molluscs, and Arthropods, but also by the Annelids, Echinoderms, Mollus- coidea, Nematodes, and Flatworms (and independently attained several times in the course of animal evolution)?a grade in which there is a centralized nervous system in the shape of a cord or cords with ganglia upon it, but in which there is no true brain. 332</page><page sequence="4">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY Animals of such a grade, although their nervous organization is so comparatively simple, yet possess a considerable complexity of general structure. It is accordingly with considerable curiosity that we turn to ask what may be the nervous mechanism of still simpler forms, such as Coelenterates?jelly-fish, sea-anemones, polyps?and Sponges. Our curiosity is justified. We here find a remarkable state of affairs. There is in sea-anemones, for instance, no central nervous system whatever. The nervous system of these animals consists only of a so-called nerve-net?an irregular network of nerve-cells and fibres spreading, now more, now less thickly, just below the surface of the whole body. This primitive arrangement, it is worth noting, may persist along with the higher centralized arrangement. An earthworm possesses a well-developed nerve-net over most of its body in addition to its prominent central nerve-cord. Even in ourselves nerve-nets persist in places where complicated responses are not wanted, as in the lining of the intestine. Such persistence of low organs and organisms by the side of high is a general feature of evolution. Various grades of complication of the nerve-net are met with. In some forms parts of it show signs of condensing to more definite structures, as in the nerve-rings near the edge of the bell in jelly- fish?the first steps towards the evolution of a centralized nervous system. In the other direction, however, not only do we find this centralization reduced to nothing, but the nervous system itself, in so far as separate from sense-organs and muscles, tends to disappear. It is as well here to remind ourselves that it is an artifieial distinction which makes this separation. The nervous system is, from a functional point of view, only part of the system which may be called sensori-motor, or still more generally receptor-effector? the system which mediates between outer world and organism, which makes it possible for the organism to give appropriate responses to the multifarious changes affecting it. This system in its developed condition consists first of a receptor portion?the sense-organs and internal receptors, tuned to the types of outer and inner event; then of an effector portion?the glands and muscles which may be set into action; and finally of an adjustor portion?the central part of the nervous system, by whose activity the incoming impulses are sorted, guided, co-ordinated, and in a word adjusted to the activities of the animal. Now, in some Coelenterates this adjustor portion is wholly absent. The sensory cells, as often occurs, are at the same time nervous, in that while their outer portion is adapted to receiving 333</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES stimuli from the world without, their inner end is prolonged into a fibre of a nervous nature, capable of efficiently conducting stimuli. But this conducting fibre does not run to a nervous organ, a nervous exchange, where it can make various connections. It runs directly to muscle. The sensori-motor mechanism is thus reduced to what would at first sight appear to be its simplest terms: stimuli from the outer world are translated by the sensory cells into messages which run directly to the museles which are to be touched into action* The connection is given from the outset, and is always there, always the same; differences in response can only depend on difference of physiological state in the sensori-motor mechanism, not in difference of connection or path. As G. H. Parker has pointed out, this implies a very different conception of the nature and function of " sense-organs " from our notions of every day. If we were asked to define the biological significance of a sense-organ in the most general terms, we should most of us say that it was an organ which gave an organism infor? mation about changes in the outer world. That is no doubt in the main true for the higher animals and for ourselves, but it cannot be true for the lowly creatures we have just been describing. The museles are not given information about changes in the outer world: they are made to contract. Action is a muscle's strong point, not the storage of facts or the sifting of evidence! And there is no central adjustor mechanism in being to which the information can be presented for any such storage or sifting. Sense-organs, then, in their first origin, are not givers of information at all?they are organs for better-adapted action. When a jelly- fish possesses eye-like structures, we have no right to say, as zoologists in the past have often said, that it can see?we ourselves do not see with our eyes, but with the combination eye-plus-cortex ; we can say only that a jelly-fish with eyes can react more nicely to small differences in light-intensity than can one with no eye or with a more primitive type. I said above that the elimination of the central adjustor part of our system reduced it to what would appear its simplest terms. As a matter of fact, however, this is appearance only. The terms can be still further simplified, and are so in the group of Sponges. All living matter is in some degree what we, perhaps meta- phorically, call sensitive: in other words, it reacts to changes of various sorts in the outer world. A sense-organ is only an organ which has developed to a higher pitch the power of reacting to one or other of these outer stimuli, so that it can respond to lower intensities or smaller differences of stimuius than can crude primitive protoplasm. 334</page><page sequence="6">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY Thus it is on the cards that we might find animals of so simple a construction and mode of life that they would not require fine shades of " sensibility," but could rely upon muscle itself responding readily enough to changes in environment to bring about the few and limited actions needful for existence. This, it would seem, is the case in Sponges, the most lowly-organized of all multicellular animals.1 No one has ever succeeded in demonstrating either nerves or receptor organs in any member of the group, and their slow-working muscle-sphincters, which open and close the incoming and outgoing apertures of the water-current which these animals make and sift for their living, appear to work in response to the direct action of external stimuli upon the fibres which compose them. This brief descent into the lower regions of the animal kingdom will at least have served to show how profoundly different the sensori-motor mechanism can be on different levels of evolution, and how chary we must be of drawing conclusions from the study of organisms like ourselves or the other mammals, with a dominant brain, and applying them to other organisms like the lower worms with central nerve-cord, but no or negligible brain, or to still others like sea-anemones in which the nervous system is no more important for individuation than the rest of the body, and the organism, unlike ourselves, is but little more than the sum of its parts. I propose now to pass from the machinery to the results? from nervous system to behaviour. The term animal behaviour has largely supplanted that of comparative psychology, for the very reason we have above mentioned?the difficulty in lower organisms of drawing far-reaching conclusions as to the mental processes accompanying action. Of course all pyschology except the purely introspective is based entirely upon interpretation of behaviour. Until the day when telepathy shall be a practicable art, we must be dependent upon indirect evidence for knowledge of the bare existence of mind even in other human beings. There, the probability of mind of the same special nature as each one of us knows exists in himself as result of direct experience is so great as to constitute certainty. In the higher vertebrates we can still say that it is a certainty that a mind of the same general nature as our own exists in them; and so on, with gradually diminishing 1 It is of no value for our present purpose to pursue the question down into the single-celled Protozoa. SufBce it to say that they show among their simplest forms a total absence of all differentiation?reception, conduction, and action all being carried on by one and the same undifferentiated protoplasm; and that many of the more complex species show structures apparently comparable in function with a well-organized nerve-net. The Metazoa, of course, start again from scratch in the matter of a common nervous system for the whole organism. 335</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES degrees of probability, down the scale; until if you were asked whether an oyster or a tapeworm possessed mind, the question becomes meaningless (because unanswerable) as a particular problem, and can only be answered, and that in a very partial sense, by reference to general evolutionary and philosophical principles. But behaviour is directly observable; and a study of this reveals a most interesting evolutionary progress. The organisms that from one point of view are the simplest, namely the single-celled Protozoa, show two main kinds of re? actions, which I may characterize as the reflex and the tropistic. A reflex action in a higher animal is of course one which depends simply upon the existence of predetermined nervous connections, via the central nervous system, between sense-organs and museles, and is, or at least can be, independent of the will. It is not especially concerned with orienting the organism in relation to the direction of the stimuius. In single-celled organisms there is no central nervous system, but they may perform actions of the reflex type, in which special movements are carried out in response to stimuli owing to the existence of such and such effector organs and such and such conducting mechanisms. The difference between true reflexes and reflex-type reactions in Protozoa is that the Protozoa usually possesses an extremely limited repertory of such actions, and that often the whole body, instead of merely a part, reacts in a reflex manner. A good example of such a reflex of the whole animal is seen in the so-called avoiding reaction of the common infusorian Paramecium. This can be called forth by very various stimuli, generally of a noxious nature?by contact with obstacles, by heat, by various chemical substances. It consists in a cessation of the animal's normal forward-swimming movement, followed by backing, turning, and then advance in a new direction. This is the most important of the few reactions possessed by Paramecium, and it relies chiefly on this to extricate itself from the difficulties that may befall it. If the performance of this reaction at the first time of asking does not take the animal away from the unpleasant stimuius which called it forth, the reaction is tried again, and so on until the Paramecium either escapes or perishes. This na'ive but effective method is called by most zoologists the method of Simple Trial and Error?the blind repe- tition of an automatic action whose performance each time opens up a slightly new field to its performer. A tropistic reaction, on the other hand, is one in which the direction of the stimuius is all-important, for the animal reacts by orienting itself in a particular way with reference to this direction. The most familiar cases of such directional reactions are brought about by light?moths move toward a light, blow-fly maggots away 336</page><page sequence="8">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY from it, the one animal therefore being styled positively, the other negatively, phototropic. Paramecium shows a good tropistic reaction on being placed in an electric current, when it swims towards the cathode (negative pole). The reaction depends upon the way the animal becomes oriented relatively to the current. This is brought about by an action of the cilia with which it swims. These normally beat backwards with a strong stroke, and are then brought forward with a weaker motion again. The action is like that of a fisherman casting, the east representing the strong backward beat. When a current is passed, the cilia on the cathode side, for some as yet imperfectly understood reason, are reversed, and they alone. Thus, however the animal is oriented at the start, it will eventually bring up with its anterior end facing the cathode, and will then continue to move in that direction because with ordinary strength of current fewer cilia are reversed than remain normal. Here then the animal is oriented by a direct action of the stimulus upon the loco? motor organs, and by the same agency is kept in the strait and narrow way. The Paramecium in an electric field is not going from greater to lower levels of intensity of stimulus, or vice versa : it is moving in a certain direction because the stimulus is directional and acts more or less directly upon the animal's locomotor machinery. The effect of electric currents is a particularly illumi? nating one, since the stimulus is not found in the animal's normal environment. I must be very brief in my survey of the evolution of behaviour. Complications are added to the first or reflex type of behaviour in various ways. In the first place, a number of reflex reactions may be possible to the same animal, and different ones may come into play according to the type or intensity of stimulus; or if the same stimulus is continued, the capacity for performing first one and then another of the reactions may wear out, through physiological fatigue, and in turn. So the unicellular Stentor " tries " several reactions one after the other in response to repeated slight taps with a fine glass rod. This stage, however, is not reached all at once in the multi- cellular animals. In them, as we have seen, life was confronted at the start with the problem of correlating the separate cells and parts of the body. For the early Metazoa have to start at a lower level of co-ordination of parts than the Protozoa from which they sprang. In a sea-anemone, for example, this process is accom- plished in a very primitive fashion?by putting together, so to speak, a number of parts, each a unit constructed so as to work in a way which is in ordinary circumstances adapted to the animal's needs. But true co-ordination?the influencing of one part by 2A 337</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES another, or the control of outlying members by a central organ such as the brain?all this is almost or wholly absent. A sea-anemone's tentacles, for instance, bend towards the mouth when stimulated ; but they continue, on stimulation, to bend to the side where the mouth ought to be, even after they have been cut off. In the same way, the creeping basal disc continues to creep if the body is severed from it. Most illuminating of all is the behaviour of tentacles when repeatedly stimulated with food. After a time they do not contract any more. This seems to be, and is, an admirably adaptive response, which normally prevents the animal becoming over-gorged with food. But if care is taken to ply the tentacles on one side only with food till they are thus fatigued, those on the other side are uninfluenced and will shove food into the already full stomach as merrily as ever, showing that the stoppage of the tentacles is a mere local fatigue, not determined centrally by a central nervous system as would be the case in higher animals. What individuality the creature possesses is given it by the general physical cohesion of its parts, much as in a crystal or a rock. Of that higher degree of individuation which is given by the reference of messages from all parts to a cerebral headquarters for action, there is scarcely a trace, nor, a fortiori, of the mental individuation which we call personality. With the advent of a central nerve-cord, however, the animal can again begin to react as a whole as did its single-celled ancestors, a single stimuius sufficing, if need be, to set off the whole body into action. Now on this new plane, with the thousands of nerve-cells and hundreds of thousands of nerve-paths present in the central nervous system, it is easy to introduce new complexity of reflex action. We get chain-reflexes, in which an external stimuius determines a first reflex, the first a second, the second a third, and so on. An example of this is the catching and swallowing of prey by a frog, where the sight of a small moving object sets the animal after it, its nearer presence causes the tongue to be shot out, its presence in the mouth (when the animal has been successful!) causes move? ments which bring it back to the opening of the gullet, its presence there a swallowing of it by the gullet's peristaltic action. The complex reflexes merge into instinct, and it is very diffieult to draw a reasonably sharp line between the two. One criterion that has been employed is to define as an instinct any non-tropistic and unreasoned activity in which the whole organism is involved, and to confine the term reflex to actions of its parts separately. Thus one may legitimately, I think, distinguish between the coil-and-strike reflex of the decapitated copperhead, 338</page><page sequence="10">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY blind, automatic, and invariable, and the attacking instinct of the intact animal, where the same reflex is utilized as a basis, but is guided by the sense-organs, and may be inhibited, for instance by fear, in the interests of the animal as a whole. Thus, again, the action of the Yucca-moth, Pronuba, in gathering pollen from the Yucca's stamens, rolling it into a ball, and pressing it into the flower's cup-shaped pistil (where it will fertilize the ovules, which will grow to seeds and so give food to the eggs that the moth pro? ceeds to lay in the plant's ovary)?such an action is neither purely reflex nor consciously purposive ; it is instinctive; it does not proceed from experience, has not been learnt, cannot envisage the whole end in view, since the moth need have no experience of Yucca flowers to perform it; and it is not a reflex because the organism as a whole is concerned in its execution. On the other hand, the egg-laying of the housefly is much more nearly a reflex action, taking place on substances giving off certain smells, some of them, such as decaying meat, suitable for the development of the young, others, such as inorganic substances smeared with assafoetida, wholly unsuitable. Very different stimuli will call forth the reaction in different species of fly, the smell of banana, for instance, causing the fruit-fly to lay eggs. Loeb attempts to include such actions under the rubric of tropisms, but it is both simpler and more correct to call them reflexes. The tropisms meanwhile also continue to play an important role. Loeb has collected the evidence on the subject in his interesting book.1 It is perhaps the machinery of tropistic reaction which is of the greatest interest?the machinery and its frank automaticity. In the case of phototropism, for example, the intensity of the light falling on the eyes determines, via the brain and nerve-cord, the strength of the impulses to the muscles which move the body. If one eye is more brightly illuminated than the other, the muscles on one side of the body will be more active than those on the other ; and the animal as it moves will turn until it is symmetrically placed with regard to the direction of the light. When this happens, the intensity of light falling on the two eyes will be equal, and the animal then continues to move on in a straight line, any devia? tion from which is automatically corrected. Whether the animal shall head towards or away from the light is determined by its physiological state, the inborn pattern residing in its nervous system, and the intensity of the light. Some animals, for instance, can be made to reverse their direction of phototropism by a change in the acidity of the water in which they are swimming, or by an increased intensity of illumination. Forced Movements, Tropisms and Animal Conduct. Philadelphia, 1918. 339</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES Various consequences flow from this. The old anthropomorphic idea that, for instance, animals move to or from light because they are " fond " of light or of darkness, has to go by the board. They are pushed, so to speak, into a given course by the direction of the light, which steers them as remorselessly as a rudder. That it is the direction of light and not the fact of illumination which determines their movements was shown by a simple experiment of Loeb. Full-grown Goldtail Moth (Porthesia) caterpillars are positively phototropic?in the old parlance, they like light and dislike darkness. But they can be made to pass from strong light into weak, provided simply that the direction of the light be suitable. Not only that, but we can construct machines which will give us in many particulars startling parallels to the behaviour of lower organisms. Hammond, the American inventor, produced a delight- ful mechanism, irreverently dubbed the Selenium Dog. It con? sisted of a steerable box on wheels, driven by a motor. The steering-gear was operated by two small electric motors, each connected with a selenium cell. The selenium cells were placed on either side of the " dog " behind a lens for focussing the light. As is well known, the electrical resistance of selenium alters with the amount of light that falls upon it, and the connection between steering-motor and steering-gear was such that more light falling upon the selenium " eye " of one side allowed more current to pass, and turned the steering-wheel towards the same side. The machine was, therefore, positively phototropic, and if you, armed with an electric torch, were left alone with it in a dark room, it would follow you about as persistently as Sherlock Holmes' opponents followed the glowing butt-end of his cigar, until to get rid of its attentions you would be forced to adopt the same ruse as he did. Another and almost striking instance is the nice selection in matters of diet shown by the " artificial amoeba." If you put a drop of chloroform in water, and poke a tiny fragment of glass rod up against, or even into it, the drop refuses to have anything to do with it, and spews it out. If, however, you previously coat the glass with shellac, the drop accepts the morsel and sucks it into its interior. Shellac, however, is soluble in chloroform. It is accordingly dissolved, or we may truthfully say digested, since the prime and essential function of digestion is the getting of food- materials into solution. When it is all gone, the naked glass remains, and its surface-tension relations with the drop are such that it is ejected ! These are not the precise methods by which, in the real Amoeba, food-stuffs are digested and indigestible remains thrown out as faeces : none the less the example gives us very considerable food for thought. If the biologically advantageous 340</page><page sequence="12">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY behaviour of the Amoeba be in any degree ascribable to true pur? pose, what about the essentially similar behaviour of the chloro- form droplet ? It is an awful warning (to use the phraseology of those moral booklets on which youth used to be reared) of the dangers of anthropomorphizing animals, and of drawing conclusions that go beyond the facts. Another example of the dangers of reading human rriind irito the behaviour of lower animals is seen in blow-fly maggots. These show marked negative phototropism, and can be made to crawl from one end to another of a long glass tube, like a flock of miniature and very silly sheep, as many times as you care to reverse its position in regard to a lamp or window; or, still better, if you have an electric light at either end of the tube, as many times as you care to switch one off and the other on. But at the moment of reversal, you often see a certain hesita* tion, an indetermination, which has a very human look about it, as if they were taking stock of the new situation and trying to make up their minds what to do about it. In reality this hesitatiori appears to have no more to do with mind than does a sailing-boat's hanging in the wind: the two hesitations, indeed, seem to be essentially of the same nature. The blow-fly larva as it moves is perpetually waving its front end from one side to the other : this front end is the most sensitive part, and in this way it explores a wider range of the environment. When the creature is moving directly away from the light and the direction of the light is suddenly reversed, one side of the head will, as a matter of mere chance, receive more illumination than the other. But before the photo-chemical processes thus initiated on this side of the head have had time to exert much effect, the instinctive side-to-side motion will have carried it across and exposed its other side to greater illumination. Thus it will usually need several head-swings before it is bent wholly round to a position in which one side is more illuminated than the other all the time. Finally, I cannot refrain from mentioning the colour-change of the flounder as illustrating the lengths to which clockwork connec? tions of receptors and effectors may go. Flounders, as you may see any day at the Plymouth Aquarium, adapt themselves in quite a few minutes and with extraordinary fidelity to the tone of their background. Not only that, but they also succeed in giving a very creditable imitation of its texture, their pattern being bold on pebbly gravel, fine-grained and uniform on sand. This result appears to be accomplished by means of direct connections between certain regions of the retina of the eye and certain regions of the skin. When a particular group of eye-receptors is stimulated by light, the resulting nerve impulse is sent via the brain and spinal 341</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES cord to a particular region of the skin, and there causes the local pigment cells to contract; while, vice versa, absence of stimulation ?in other words, blackness?for that particular retinal region will permit the pigment-cells to expand to their fullest extent. By means of this indirect machinery, a rough picture of the back? ground is reproduced on the skin of the upper surface. As we ascend the animal scale, the clear-cut tropism becomes less and less important. Tropistic reaction continues to furnish the basis for much of the animal's behaviour, just as instinct furnishes the basis for much of our own behaviour. But in us instinct is almost invariably modified in the most marked way by experience and reason : and similarly in animals on the behaviour- level of higher insects, for instance, or of reptiles, simple tropisms are swallowed up in something more complex. For example, it can be established that to a low animal, like the blow-fly maggot, the only matter of moment is the total quantity of light which strikes it. Whether this proceeds from an intense pin-point or is diffused over a large source is immaterial. We all know, however, that this does not hold for the adults of many higher insects. The moth flies to the lamp, but hides from day: and as a matter of fact can in the laboratory be shown to respond quite differently to the small intense and the large diffuse source of light. A very curious special case, that of young turtles, has been analysed by Parker. The female loggerhead turtle lays her eggs in the sand. When the young hatch out, they always seem to find their way to the sea, whether it be visible to them or no. All sorts of explanations were put forward, mostly assuming some mystic innate knowledge on the part of the young reptile. Parker, however, has at length shown that it is based on a perfectly definite but unusual tropism. The animals orient themselves towards that direction in which the horizon is freest from obstruction. If he cleared away all the bush on the landward side of high-water mark, and put in a row of dead branches in the sand on the seaward side of the eggs, the turtlets no longer " felt" or'" smelt" or " knew about " the sea, but walked straight away from it. In the second place, tropism and instincts also become modified, as we have hinted, by the development of the powers of learning. The pecking of young ehicks at their food is sometimes called instinctive, but the classic work of Lloyd Morgan showed that it is nothing of the kind. What is innate is the instinct or reflex to peck at any and every " interesting " object. New-hatched ehicks kept away from older birds peck at bright pebbles, at noxious as well as edible caterpillars, at wasps as well as wheat-grains, at water, even at their own feet. Through the principles of learning enunciated by Thorndike, the stamping-in to behaviour of pleasur- 342</page><page sequence="14">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY able and successful experiences, the stamping-out of unpleasantness and failure, in a remarkably short space of time they are found to be confining their attention to their proper food. A chick does not even know water when it sees it. Its only instinct on the subject is to drink when it is thirsty and when its beak comes in contact with water. And it will only come in contact with water accidentally, in the course of the random pecking we have just mentioned. In the higher insects a great multiplicity of complex special instincts arise with the enlargement of the primitive insect brain. It is impossible to reduce the behaviour of the Tortugas ant, for instance, which was studied by Mayer, to tropisms only. If one of these, questing about at some distance from home, discovers a large piece of food such as a dead fly, it at once returns to the nest. There it crosses feelers with all the ants it meets, and so generates a definite " excitement " in these. The excitement spreads, and a whole band of ants, apparently led by the original finder, sets out in the general direction of the food. When the swarm has reached about the right distance from the nest, it breaks up, and the ants hunt about until the fly is discovered. Now if the finder-out is taken up by a human being, just after it has started on its homeward journey, and lifted across to the neighbourhood of the nest, it communicates excitement as before to a number of its fellows, but when they set off it is hardly ever in the right direction. Or if some disinfectant is smeared in its homeward path, and the finder crosses this, no excitement is generated when it rubs antennae with other ants. Thus the apparent " talking " by means of antennae is here at least not true speech at all, but based upon the simple sense of smell. Whether the apparent sense of direction exhibited by the swarm is really such, or is based again on smell?on the capacity to follow the finder's back-trail; and whether the apparent sense of distance shown by the swarm's breaking up when sufficiently far from the nest is really such, or depends on some capacity to react to the same number of steps on the outward as on the inward journey?these are points which we cannot yet decide. In any case it is clear that several special and complicated mechanisms are involved. It is, I think, evident that the contention, urged especially by Ray Lankester and Arthur Thomson, that there has been a funda? mental divergence between Vertebrates and Arthropods (especially Insects) as regards behaviour, is a valid one. Even the highest Insects are found to be relatively small-brained (when due allow? ance has been made for differences in relative amount of muscle and skeleton dependent on differences in absolute size). They 343</page><page sequence="15">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES show many and well-defined reflexes and instincts, but compara? tively little power of learning and profiting by experience. This history of the Vertebrate, however, is largely a history of the acquisition of the power of learning and of the willingness to experiment. Fish learn, but slowly on the whole, and poorly. So do Amphibia and Reptiles. Not only that, but they are, we may say, unenterprising. Take one single aspect of the matter?can you call to mind an example of a young fish or frog or tortoise indulging in play, or even picture the possibility of such sportive- ness ? Mammals like porpoises and dolphins play round the bows of ships, but not fish like sharks or bonitos. Birds and mammals show far larger powers. The basis for this advance is laid down in their physiology and mode of life? constant temperature gives them the possibility of introducing far more finely-adjusted processes of brain and mind; and the long period of embryonic life, together with that of parental care following it, gives wholly new opportunities for increasing the size of brain and lengthening the period of learning?of passing from inexperience to experience ; indeed, of allowing experience any large effect at all without falling a victim to starvation or enemies in the meantime. The average bird seems stupider than the average mammal, but has a more intense and more varied emotional life. Since, however, it is the evolution of intelligence which has eventually brought life to new levels, it is on the mammals that our chief interest must be fixed. There are, of course, all gradations of intelligence in mammals, as in men. But of the typical successful mammal of fair size and considerable activity, such as deer or horse or eat or fox, we may note one or two special points. In the first place, a rudimentary tradition has arisen: the young accompany their parents and are taught certain things?often indirectly, rarely directly?by them. This happens too in birds. But the tradition never bridges more then one generation's span, and is therefore not cumulative, as in the human species. Then the young play. This gives the possibility for acquiring a new pitch of dexterity, and provides the opportunity for various experiments in behaviour. And finally they can learn, much and quickly, from experience. But they are still largely tied down by their structure. The dexterity of the eat or the dog or the horse, for all its perfection, is a limited dexterity: the limbs are so beautifully adapted for certain functions that they are useless for others. And, as so often, specialization closes the door to progress. Emancipation from water brought about new progress by con- 344</page><page sequence="16">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY fronting life with an environment which was more difficult than the old. The very necessity of surmounting these difficulties led in the long run to the calling into existence of new elaborations. The need for more support in air than water paved the way for the possibility of lifting the body off the ground?and this for new possibilities of speed. The need for protection against drying led to the evolution of new types of skin. The desirability of keeping the embryo moist and yet not having to be tied to breeding in the water, led to the evolution of the large-yolked, shell-protected egg of reptiles, one of whose organs, the allantois, later made the placenta possible. So it was again in the mammals. Emancipation from earth brought new problems, and their solution gave new possibilities. Arboreal life was the first step to man. Not only have we to acknowledge that the monkey type is ancestral to ourselves, but that it or some extremely similar type was a necessary one for the production of man or anything like him. Arboreal life did many things. It released the limbs, and in particular the forelimbs, from their pillar-like function of mere support. It made the hands instead of the snout and mouth the animal's chief testing organ. Thus when the forbears of man descended to ground life once again, they found it to their advantage to adopt the bipedal erect posture, so that their arms and hands could be left free. It made necessary a far greater variety of limb- movements, a far more accurate body-balance. It made necessary an increased power of rapid estimation of distance. Most important of all, it made sight instead of smell the dominant sense. Thus both limb-structure and mind-structure became of neces? sity improved, especially in the direction of more varied response ; and these improvements were one and all necessary before the human type could arise. We may divide the mammals, from our present point of view, into five main grades?the primitive and sub-typical forms, the typical successful creatures, the tailed monkeys, the apes, and man. Thorndike and other American workers have made extensive investigations on typical mammals, such as cat, raccoon, or pig. Their experiments show that there is scarcely any evidence for the existence of ideas or images in such forms. They can learn, for instance, how to undo very complicated fastenings, but the method of learning is usually the simple, primitive one of the trial of random movements, successful ones being " stamped in " to the nervous organization, unsuccessful ones " stamped out." It is the simple trial and error method, but immensely improved by the " retention of success." True imitation, contrary to popular belief, plays hardly any part. 345</page><page sequence="17">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES With Monkeys, on the other hand, several new points are noticeable. For one thing, the initiative of the animals is far greater: they are always experimenting. Their free hands and nimble fingers itch to be employed, and they employ them as a child does, for the sake of doing something, of new sensations, and of the sense of power. They further show a slightly increased capacity of imitation, and, in general, their behaviour has progressed to a pitch at which it is hard to say whether or not true ideas or at least images must be postulated. Of recent years, Kohler, the German psychologist, has intro? duced a rather different mode of approach. Instead of putting the animals in often very artificial situations, where the problem is, we may say, man-made, he presents them with the opportunity of solving problems for themselves, and problems not too unlike those to be met with in nature. An account of these may be found in his interesting book, The Mentality of Apes. The funda? mental principle which has emerged from such work is this? that as we go up the vertebrate scale, the type of problem which can be grasped and solved as a single whole grows increasingly more complex. A fowl is helpless before a situation which a dog can grasp; aimless action follows in the one case, purposeful action in the other. In the same way, a dog is helpless before many problems which even a young child can understand and solve, just as a child often fails where a man succeeds. Or again, a stupid man does not even see how to attack a mathematical exercise; a more intelligent person grasps its meaning, sets about looking in the right direction, and works it out; and the mathe- matically-gifted man not only grasps its meaning, but may see the solution as well, all in a flash. Kohler was also able to show that the highest non-human mammals, like chimpanzees, retained accurate memories of a situation much longer than lower forms, much longer even than the intelligent dog. For instance, when he buried some titbit under the eyes of a chimpanzee, but outside the cage, and then during the night smoothed all the surrounding earth so that no visible traces of the burial remained, some animals, even after twenty-four hours, would go straight to the spot, or very close to it, and begin digging ; while a dog, on the other hand, in the same circumstances, only remembered for an hour or so at most, a hen for a few minutes. This Kohler interprets as implying true memory?the formation and retention of a true memory-image similar to our own images, and not merely the lower grade of memory involved in doing better or quicker a second time something which, after much trial and error, has led to fruition when first attempted. Thus if we look at the question objectively we see that the progress of mind 346</page><page sequence="18">MIND CONSIDERED BIOLOGICALLY in higher vertebrates means largely the possibility of solving " by intuition " problems of increasing complexity?problems involving the simultaneous grasp of increasingly numerous separate factors: and on the other hand of retaining an image or its cerebral counterpart for longer and longer periods of time. From this point of view, Bergson's stressing of intuition is profound and right. A problem is presented: the solution either is or is not found; if found, it issues in a single indivisible course of action directed towards an end. On the other hand, in the human level it is found that the methods of step-by-step reasoning are often the tortoise to the intuitive hare, and may arrive eventually at further goals than intuition alone can even see. The hen successfully running round the back of a wire barrier separating it from its food is achieving something impossible to a worm or a sea-urchin, or indeed to many insects, and is showing, in primitive degree no doubt, but none the less definitely, something of the faculty which enables a judge to pronounce a sentence, a statesman to decide upon a course of action, or a mathematician or man of science to solve a difficult theoretical problem. Let us for a moment look back and see what is involved in the mind of the most primitive man or even of the highest anthropoid. Reflex actions, unconscious and predetermined by heredity, are at the basis of most of his ordinary activities. Simple tropisms, on the other hand, have been almost completely swallowed up in later developments, and cannot be detected as such. Instincts, by which we mean the predetermined impulse to react to certain stimuli in a certain general way, but with the details of the reaction not laid down, are also of fundamental importance. If the reflexes provide the possibility of unconscious action, the instincts canalize and direct the creature's behaviour. However, the power of learning, both in acquiring greater motor dexterity, and in modi- fying reaction according to experience, comes to overlie instinct and tropism. Then comes image-formation, giving an enormously greater precision and continuity. Then in man, generalization; and with this the knowledge and experience of life changes from a patchwork or mosaic to a continuous whole, from a mere diary to an ordered drama. Each type of reaction?reflex, instinct, imagery, reason?is necessary to the type of behaviour as a whole; each is the basis for the mode of reaction above it, and may intrude itself upwards, often unpleasantly enough, into the field of reasoned consciousness. This reasoned consciousness we are apt to think of as the only essential kernel of our behaviour; but the study of behaviour from the evolutionary point of view joins hands with the dis- 347</page><page sequence="19">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES coveries of modern psychology as to the role of the subconscious to shatter that unpleasant illusion. Too often when instincts intrude into reason, they are rationalized?that is, consciousness finds reasons why we should act upon the instincts. Rationaliza- tion is not reason, any more than stucco over brick is marble; but the inexperienced are in both cases apt to confuse the imitation with the genuine article. From the broadest standpoint of all we may sum up thus. The lowest organisms have merely physical individuality. Then comes what we may call nervous individuality, which is physical individuality of a peculiarly efficient sort, with greater coherence, greater co-ordination of parts than is possible through other physical means. Gradually consciousness begins to play a more and more useful role. But at first consciousness is fragmentary, and the mental evolution of higher animals consists in binding together the parts of consciousness into more and more of a unity, until finally in man life attains to full mental individuality, to which the name of personality is usually given. 348</page></plain_text>
