<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV THE GOAL OF MUHAMMADAN MYSTICISM1 By REYNOLD A. NICHOLSON TIIHE title of this paper suggests a definite answer to a definite question. I do not think that such an answer can be given except in very general terms. The mystics of Islam, like all other mystics, recognize that the object of their search cannot be apprehended by knowledge, much less described by words. The goal is ineffable: all that can be done is to describe the journey from beginning to end. This is no easy task, and would assuredly be a long one if we accept the view of a celebrated Persian theosophist that the ways to God are in number as the souls of men. It is possible, however, to reduce to a system the main features, both theoretical and practical, of any mystical type, and with the help of a highly developed symbolism to indicate in some degree what is the nature of those experiences which lie beyond thought and knowledge. My present purpose is to discuss the meanings attached by Sufis to certain metaphorical terms which are used in reference to the state of union with God. A Moslem, as well as a Christian, might speak of union with God, but the former would be more likely, perhaps, to describe the consummation of the mystic life as " extinction in the Real" (fana ft I-haqq). The term fana, which has been rendered by " passing away" or "annihilation", plays a great part in Sufi literature, and 1 This paper was read at the Fourth International Congress for the History of Religions held at Leiden, September 9-13, 1912. I have added the original text of the passages quoted in translation.</page><page sequence="2">50 THE GOAL OF MUHAMMADAN MYSTICISM is familiar to European students, but its history has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Fresh light is thrown upon it by texts which have recently been discovered or made accessible. The first Persian manual of Sufism, the Kashf al-Mahjiib, can now be read in an English translation, and two copies have come to England of an earlier work that wras believed to have been lost, probably the oldest surviving treatise on the subject in Arabic, the Kitdb al Luma1 by Abu Nasr al-Sarraj, who died in 378 a.h. (f)88-9 A.D.). As I am preparing an edition of the Kitdb al-Luma* for publication in the Gibb Memorial Series, I need only say that it contains much valuable information which is not to be found elsewhere and that it especially adds to our knowledge of the pantheistic and ecstatic aspects of Sulisin. The author in several places explains his conception of fana, and I will now quote some of these passages, which are important both on account of their early date and because the book is often cited as an authority by Qushayri and subsequent writers. Explana tions of mystical terms are hard to understand and still harder to translate, so I must claim your indulgence if I have failed in either respect. In choosing an English phrase equivalent to fana one has to consider its correlative term, baqd, which expresses just the opposite meaning. Baqd signifies "continuance", and the opposite of "continuance" is not "extinction" or " annihilation", but " transience " or " passing away ". Therefore, although find does imply the meaning of annihilation and extinction, " passing away " would seem to be a more exact rendering of the term. According to the author of the Ltima1, the original meaning of fana and baqd is the passing away of ignorance through the continuance of knowledge, the passing away of disobedience through the continuance of obedience, the passing away of forgetting (God) through the continuance of remembering (Him), the passing away of regarding</page><page sequence="3">THE GOAL OF MUHAMMADAN MYSTICISM 57 human actions through the continuance of regarding God's providence in His eternal foreknowledge.1 In another place he says: "The meaning oi fund is the passing away of the attributes of the lower soul (oiafs) and the passing away of repugnance to, and reliance on, anything that may happen. Baqd denotes continuance in this condition. Again, fana is the passing away of a man's regarding in his actions that which he does, through God's taking his place therein." 2 The term dhahdb, " going away," is nearly synonymous withfand, and signifies, our author says, " the going away of the mind from perception of sensible objects through the contemplation of that which it beholds; then the mind goes away from its going away, and this is infinite. To one in this state all things are non-existent and nothing is perceived 03' the senses."3 Al-Sarraj describes faoid as a gradual process. He enumerates the following live steps :? 1. The vanishing of his consciousness of the present life and the future life through the coining over him of the thought of God. 2. The vanishing of his consciousness of thinking of God in his consciousness of God's thinking of him. 1 Luma\ Mb : JjJ* *lLj UUJ\ v Li &lt;dA\ ci ' UJU f Lill ^-j CL&gt;l?p- b. /Li. &lt;i]\ *U^&lt;0dL*!ULi. &lt;uUal\ &gt;ULj L**x^\ *Li. 2 Luma*, 151a : -Jii^-sS^ t2^ * ^*5 ^/*JbJ\ &lt;U-o * Li * Li!l ,A*'?? ?Liy* *Li l-Jjilj u-^Ji lt^ ^r*-^ *^ *ULHj ^i.

The passing awaj' of regarding God's thought of him, so that onty his consciousness of God remains. 4. The vanishing of his consciousness of God through regarding his consciousness. 5. The vanishing of his consciousness of regarding his consciousness through the passing awa3' of passing away and the continuance of continuance.l Although these definitions are expressed in technical language, I think their purport will be tolerably clear to anyone conversant with other forms of mysticism. But not only does our author explain what fand is, he also tells us what, in his opinion, it is not. In two chapters headed respective^' "the passing away of qualities" and " the passing away of humanity " he criticizes theories of fand which were current in his time. "Some nasties of Baghdad," he sa3Ts, " have erred in their doctrine that when the3r pass away from their qualities thc^y enter into the qualities of God. This involves incarnation (liulul) or leads to the Christian belief concerning Jesus.2 The doctrine in question has been attributed to some of the ancients, but its true meaning is this, that when a man goes forth from his own qualities and enters into the qualities of God, he goes forth from his own will, which is a gift to him from God, and enters into the will of God, knowing that his will is given to him 03' God and that by virtue of this gift he is severed from regarding himself and becomes entirety devoted to God ; and this is one of the stages of Unitarians.

To make God identical with His qualities is to be guilty of iiitidolity, because God does not descend into the heart, but that which descends into the heart is faith in God and belief in His unit3r and reverence for the thought of Him." * It will be noticed that the author does not condemn the doctrine of the passing awa3' of human qualities, which, indeed, forms part of his own explanation of fand: he only rejects what seems to him a dangerous interpretation of the doctrine. The second hercs3', &lt;: the passing away of humanity," is criticized as follows:? " Some have abstained from food and drink, fancying that when a man's bod3' is weakened it is possible that he may lose his humanit37 and be invested with the attributes of divinity.

Humanity does not depart from man any more than blackness departs from that which is black or whiteness from that which is white, but the inborn qualities of humanity are changed and transmuted by the all-powerful radiance that is shed upon them from the Divine Realities. The attributes of humanity are not the essence of humanity. Those who inculcate the doctrine oi fand mean the passing away of regarding one's own actions and works of devotion through the continuance of regarding God as the doer of these actions on behalf of His servant." l AVe are now in a position to formulate the notion of fund as explained by the author of the Kitdb al-Luona1. Substantially the same explanation is given 03' Quslniyri,2 whose classical apology for Sufism was published sixty years after the death of al-Sarraj, and also by the author of the Kashf al-Mahjoib* a contemporary of Qushayri. AU these writers endeavour to show that Sufism is thoroughly orthodox, and assert that its doctrines, rightly understood, are nothing but the true esoteric science contained in the Koran and the Traditions of the Prophet.

Fand, then, involves? 1. A moral transformation of the soul through the extinction of all its passions and desires. The passing away of evil qualities and of the evil actions which the}' produce is said to be brought about by the continuance of the corresponding good qualities and actions. This means that when ignorance, for example, passes away, knowledge remains, and that when a man ceases to forget God he necessarily continues to remember Him. 2. A mental abstraction or passing away of the mind from all objects of perception, thoughts, actions, and feelings through its concentration upon the thought of God. Here the thought of God signifies contemplation of the Divine attributes. 3. The cessation of all conscious thought. The highest stage of fand is reached when even the consciousness of having attained fand disappears. This is what Sufis call u the passing away of passing away" (fand al-fand). The mystic is now rapt iu contemplation of the Divine essence.1 Often, though not invariably, fand is accompanied by loss of sensation. Sari al-Saqati, a famous Sufi of the third century, expressed the opinion that if a man in this state were struck on the face with a sword he would not feel the blow.2 Abu '1-Khayr al-Aqta' had a gangrene in 1 Qushayri, 44, 12, distinguishes three stages oi fand similar to those described above. The fir at is "passing away from the 'self and its qualities through continuance in the qualities of God " ; the necond is "passing awa}' from the qualities of (iod through contemplation of &lt;j!od" ; and the third is "passing away from the contemplation of passing away through annihilation {isfilddk) in the being of Ood". The last words are remarkable as showing that a comparatively orthodox Suff could use the language of pure pantheism, but they show, too, the danger of understanding mystical expressions in their literal and obvious sense. Qushayri refers to the unconscious absorption of thought and will in contemplation of the Divine being. 1 Luma', 102ft.</page><page sequence="8">02 THE GOAL OF MUHAMMADAN MYSTICISM his foot. The physicians declared that his foot must be amputated, but he would not allow this to be done. His disciples said, "Cut it oil'while he is praying, for at that time he is unconscious." The phj'sieians acted on their advice, and when Abu 'l-Khayr finished his prayers he found that his foot had been amputated.1 It is diflicult to see how anyone far advanced in fand could be capable of keeping the religious law?a point on which the orthodox mystics lay great emphasis. Here the doctrine of saintship comes in. God takes care to preserve His favourites from disobedience to His commands. AVe are told that Bayazid, Shibli, and other saints were continually in a state of rapture until the hour of prayer arrived ; then they returned to consciousness, and after performing their prayers became enraptured again.2 It has been said that all thinking Moslems are pantheists, though some do not know it.:i This paradox is the logical consequence of their Unitarianism. The absolute unity of Allah, which had to be maintained at all costs, swallowed up everything else. But the mystic theologians were well aware of the danger to which the doctrine of absolute unity exposed them. Islam would become a mere empty name if the Moslem profession of faith?" there is no god but Allah"?were openty admitted to be a religious statement of the fact that nothing except Allah really* exists. To proclaim that bare fact is to sweep the wdiole fabric of positive religion off* the face of the earth. Accordingly we find in the early Sufi textbooks repeated warnings that God is essentially different from His creatures, and that any union based on identity of substance is a blasphemous dream, liujwirf, for example, defines fand as the passing away of man's will in God's will?not 1 Kathf al-Mahjilb, 304. 2 Ibid., 257. 3 See "One phase of the doctrine of the unity of God ", byi).

The results of this alliance have been set forth with admirable clearness 1j3t Mr. Whintield,2 and 1 need not dwell upon them here. Neoplatonisin supplied the metaphysical foundation of the new S3rstein. Allah was identified with the Neoplatonic One, in which all real being is included. On the other hand, all unreal being? the world of phenomena and man?is " matter" or " not-being", whieh only appears to exist through reflecting real being and thereby borrowing a sort of phantasmal reality. Alan belongs to both worlds. On one side the baser elements of his nature attach him to the shows and apparitions of this life, but his true being is the divine spark in the ground of his soul, in virtue of wrhieh he is essentially one with God. Is he not, then, above law and religion ? The answer is, that law and religion are neeessaiy bonds, so long as man is associated with not-being, which is the source of evil. While the older theory of fand depended on the theological conception of God as absolute will, the theory which we are now considering starts from the philosophical idea of God as absolute being. That from which the mystic of this school strives to pass awa3' is the phenomenal universe, including all that is unreal in himself. Probably, however, his aspirations will not be expressed with such cold propriety. Mysticism is neither philosophy nor 1 Kashf al-Mahjub, 245. 8 See the introduction to his edition of the Onhhan-i Bdz, hy Malimud Shahistarf, and compare my Selections from the Divdn-i Shams-i Tabriz, pp. 31-6 of the introduction.</page><page sequence="10">&lt;)4 THE GOAL OF MUHAMMADAN MYSTICISM theolog3r nor both together. It can turn these sciences to account, as we have seen, but no sooner has it absorbed them than the3' suffer, like Alonso in Ariel's song, " A sea-change Into something rich and strange." It is general\y accepted that Sufism?the pantheistic; movement in Islam?was the result of many co-operating circumstances. The course of theological speculation, and the inevitable revolt against its inhumanly rigid formalism, was one cause. Another was the influence of Greek and Indian thcosoph}'. How to prevent the new wine from bursting the old bottles, how to control the mighty torrent which menaced Islam with destruction and break its force hy diverting it into the well-worn traditional channels? this was the problem that faced Muhammadan religious thinkers in the Middle Ages. It was solved, as 3rou know, hy Ghazali, but the solution was a Pj'rrhic victory from the orthodox point of view, since it made room in Islam for frenzied poets worshipping no god but the Eternal Beauty, 1113'stical monists like Ibn al-'Arabf, and swarms of dervishes who in cveiy sense are Brethren of the Free Spirit. Although the fact that Islam has never shown itself so intolerant as Christian^' towards pantheistic errors is partty, no doubt, owing to the absence of an3' organized ecclesiastical authority, I believe a better reason may be found for it. To Christians, of course, the claim of aii3' man to be a Christ must appear shocking, but in Western and Central Asia?where the Sasanian kings were regarded hy their subjects as gods, and where the doctrines of incarnation, anthropomorphism, and metempsychosis are indigenous?the idea of the God-man was so far from unfamiliar and unnatural that aii3' one who came forward as such was justified in his claim 03' the public conscience, however he might be condemned for " betraying the secret of his Lord". It is true that Hallaj, who uttered the</page><page sequence="11">THE GOAL OF MUHAMMADAN MYSTICISM 65 famous words Ana 'Mjaqq, " I am the Heal," died on the scaffold, but here, as in many other cases, the execution was dictated by political motives. His followers believed that he was taken up alive to heaven and that the actual victim was not he, but a horse or a mule or one of his enemies whom God had transformed into his likeness: which legends, as M. Massiguon has lately pointed out,1 rest on the conviction that a God-man could not possibly suffer the indignity of being crucified and cremated. Among the Moslem saints wc meet with several extreme pantheists who would certainly have shared the fate of Hal la j if they had owned allegiance to the mediaeval Catholic Church. Thus Bayazkl of Bistam is reported to have said, using the terms of glorification which Moslems ordinarily apply to God alone, " Glory to me ! How great is my majesty !" and again, " I went from God to God until lie cried from me in me,' O thou I!' " 2 Such utterances do not deeply offend Muhammadan sentiment, and, if spoken in ecstasy, are readily condoned. Jahilu'ddin Rumi in a magnificent ode describes how the One Light shines in myriad forms through the whole universe, and how the One Essence, remaining ever the same, clothes itself from age to age in a series of incarnations. Let me conclude by quoting a few lines:? "Every moment the robber Beauty rises in a different shape, ravishes the soul, and disappears. Every- instant that Loved One assumes a new garment, now of eld, now of youth. Now lie plunged into the heart of the substance of the potter's clay?the Spirit plunged, like a diver. Anon He rose from the depths of mud that is moulded and baked, then He appeared in the world. He became Noah, and at His prayer the world was flooded while lie went into the Ark. 1 See his article "ul-Hullaj " iu Jtecue de Vhintoirn des retiyion* foi* June, 1011. 2 Tadhkirat al-Airliyd, i, 100, 13.
