<plain_text><page sequence="1">Remarks Murray Sidman Northeastern University I suggested last time that cognition and stimulus control are essentially the same field, that the analytic units appropriate to a science of knowing should be the same units with which we analyze relations between behavior and its controlling environ ment. Furthermore, by appreciating that descriptions of stimulus control will require us to identify relations among elements of the controlling environment itself, and by including such "stimulus-stimulus" relations in our descriptive units, we open the way for a behavioral attack upon some, at least, of those complex phenomena which define knowledge. The absence of satisfactory units of descrip tion and analysis has helped to keep behaviorists and cognitive psychologists from recognizing many of their shared interests. Another set of problems arises from our inability to identify particular instances of stimulus control/cognition by means of a single observation. At the simplest level this inability is a consequence of the inherent complexity of all stimuli. For example, if our pigeon subject pecks only at the key which has a line on it, we still cannot tell on any particular occasion whether the peck is controlled by the line's tilt, height, width, illuminance, distance from the floor, or any of a number of other possibilities. Only after undertaking additional observations, in which we systemat ically alter various features of the line, can we say which features might have controlled the subject's behavior on any particular occasion. Even then, control may well have fluctuated among several correlated sources. The point here is not that the analysis of stimulus control is inexact. Even if a stimulus were infinitely divisible into components we could, given adequate techni cal resources, sharpen our control and specify the behaviorally effective compo nents with any level of precision our purpose required. The point is, rather, that stimulus control is always an inference. We can, of course, observe and measure a single instance of any stimulus, but we can never know except by inference whether we are actually observing a particular controlling relation between two stimuli or between a stimulus and a response. Unlike individual stimuli and responses, con trolling relations are not directly observable. Their own failure to appreciate the inferential nature of stimulus control has led some behaviorists to assert that they, unlike cognitive theorists, are concerned only 123</page><page sequence="2">Murray Sidman with observable events. They have been guilty here of false pride, one effect of which has been to generate similarly inappropriate emotional reactions among cognitive psychologists. But perhaps a more regrettable consequence has been to prevent behaviorists from including some cognitive phenomena within their avowed subject matter. It is not difficult to find instances in which unacknowledged inferences about controlling stimuli have led to impoverished interpretations of complex processes. One example arises in the context of the two-choice discrimination procedure so frequently used by experimenters both of behavioral and cognitive persuasion. In such experiments we usually record how often the subject selects (or fails to select) an arbitrarily designated positive stimulus. The actual controlling stimuli, however, are not easy to specify. Suppose, for example, an experimenter presents two stimuli, one of which he calls red and the other green, and gives a pigeon access to grain only if it pecks a red key. Once the pigeon has learned always to peck a red (positive) and never a green (negative) key, we might be tempted to infer that both of the experimenter-specified stimuli are relevant to the subject. The problem with this inference is not just that some feature other than color may be relevant; let us assume it is valid here to specify the controlling stimuli by reference to color. The problem I am posing is: Does each of the two colors or just one of them enter into the controlling relations? If only one is a controlling stimulus, which one is it? What might it mean to say that red, but not green, is a controlling stimulus in this situation? There is certainly a functional difference, positive vs. negative, between the two stimuli, so we cannot just disregard the negative stimulus. How can we specify it if not by its green color? A reasonable substitute might simply be, "not red." The controlling stimuli for the subject, instead of being red and green, would then be red and the absence of red. If this inference were correct we should be able to substitute other stimuli for green without disturbing the subject's performance; the pigeon should continue to peck only at red and never at "not red." On the other hand, we might want to test the equally compelling inference that the controlling stimuli for the subject were green and "not green." If this were true, we should be able to substitute other stimuli for red without disturbing the subject's performance; the pigeon should continue to peck at any stimuli which are not green, but never at green itself. We might pursue several additional inferences about stimulus control in the seemingly simple two-choice discrimination situation, but let it suffice to point out that we usually do not test the validity of the various possible inferences. One consequence of such neglect by behaviorists has been a self-imposed isolation from some important problem areas, leaving them by default to cognitive psychologists. For example, subjects who specify the positive stimulus simply as "not negative" will select the positive stimulus not on the basis of its particular features but by exclusion, after they have rejected a particular negative stimulus. Subjects who meet our contingencies by excluding the negative stimulus demonstrate a different kind of knowledge about the "world" than subjects who select specific features of 124</page><page sequence="3">Remarks the positive stimulus. Yet these different controlling relations produce exactly the same objective records, manifesting themselves only later when the subjects meet the stimuli again in different contexts. The very process, therefore, of verifying our inferences about controlling stimuli, even in this simple experimental situation, will embroil us in questions about the effect of experience upon subsequent learning. This, of course, is an area of basic conflict between cognitive and behavioral conceptions of intellectual development, an area in which the impact of a rigorous analysis of stimulus control has yet to make itself felt. Even where the need for inference stems only from stimulus complexity its acknowledgment may help clarify some of our basic conceptions of discrimination learning. In testing the speed of discrimination learning, one seeks to infer how rapidly a subject's (or student's) behavior comes under the control of certain stimuli which also control the experimenter's (or teacher's) behavior. Thus, an increase in the frequency of "correct" responses (or a decrease in "errors"), as measured in the classical learning curve, represents a comparison between the behavior of experi menter and subject, a measurement of the rapidity with which the subject's behavior comes into conformity with the experimenter's. To the extent that behaviorists have attached scientific significance to such egocentric comparisons as are reflected in the shapes of learning curves, it must be admitted that the practice of behaviorism has been inconsistent with its philosophy. Learning curves might just as well be called teaching curves, for they allow us to infer at least as much about the behavior of experimenters as about the behavior of subjects. (I have suggested before in these pages that learning curves inform us only about the behavior of experimenters.) Cognition theory's insistence, via the notion of "hypotheses," that we can just as validly attribute the inferential process to the subject as to the experimenter is, in a somewhat perverse way, the more behavioral conception. At issue here is the nature of inference, itself a behavioral process. Cognition theory fails because it takes the subject's inferences as explanation instead of attempting to explain them by reference to the experimenter's behavior ? or, in nonlaboratory situations, by reference to other environmental variables. If behaviorists would adopt cognitive theory's concern with the subject's inferences, or hypotheses (which are as objectively recordable as any instances of stimulus control), in place of their own more typical concern with "errors," they could then attack the problem of relating patterns of hypothesis development to the experi menter's procedures. In so doing, they would come to grips with a type of dependent variable which characterizes what a subject actually does rather than what a subject fails to do. Such a shift in emphasis might also help to transform a science of learning curves into a much needed science of teaching. If we fail to recognize that stimulus complexity makes all stimulus control inferential we shall, of course, be unaware of the need to validate our inferences. A particularly embarrassing and potentially significant instance of such uncritical inference comes from investigations of matching to sample. Procedurally, matching to sample is our old friend, the conditional discrimination, with the added restric tion that the conditional stimulus and the positive discriminative stimulus be the 125</page><page sequence="4">Murray Sidman same. In a typical situation the pigeon is faced with two "comparison" keys, one red and one green. It will receive grain if it pecks the red comparison when a third key, the "sample," is also red, or if it pecks the green comparison when the sample is green. From the experimenter's point of view the correct choice is the particular comparison which is identical to the sample. But the stimuli which control the subject's behavior here are not necessarily the stimuli which the experimenter specifies. Recent evidence has suggested that for pigeons and Rhesus monkeys, even though they have learned to choose correctly in this situation, the sample and the correct comparison are not identical. The indication is that matching red to red or green to green is, for these subjects, just as arbitrary as matching red to green or green to red would be. From the subject's point of view, the samples and compari sons are different stimuli, even though the experimenter calls them the same. Experimental confirmation of such a major difference between the experi menter's and the subject's conception of the contingencies in matching-to-sample tasks is still incomplete, but the logical possibility is clear. It is embarrassing because of our frequent contention that procedures like matching to sample provide access to advanced cognitive processes, even with nonhuman species. Acceptance of such unverified inferences about stimulus control in nonhuman subjects is a kind of anthropomorphism which behaviorists might have been expected to reject almost intuitively. Even with human subjects, however, we need to confirm our inferences about the actual controlling stimuli before we claim the involvement of those stimuli in complex processes. If it turns out that typical matching-to-sample proce dures do not generate the type of stimulus control which experimenters have assumed, the discovery will be constructively significant to the extent that procedu ral modifications can succeed in making the controlling stimuli the same for experimenter and subject. Several laboratories are currently engaged in enterprises of this sort. If they prove unsuccessful, we shall have to acknowledge their cleansing effect. Some of the more interesting gaps in our conception of stimulus control arise from our uncritical and imprecise application of the term to many different kinds of controlling relations. By way of contrast, we may cite the term, reinforcement, also a name for a controlling relation and also only inferrable. But the reinforcement relation is narrowly defined, sufficiently so that one need only infer whether or not it took place on any given occasion. Such specificity is not true of stimulus control. We may know that a controlling relation exists, and we may even have identified the actual controlling stimuli with a reasonable degree of assurance, yet we may still be unable to specify the particular type of control in which the stimuli are involved. To determine whether certain kinds of controlling relations have been established will therefore involve another level of inference. Recognition of the need for such inferences, and for their validation, will open some more complex cognitive proc esses to behavioral investigation. More of this in a subsequent column. 126</page></plain_text>
