<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gordion Seals and Sealings: Individuals and So ciety, by Elspeth R. M. Dusinberre. University Mu seum Monograph 124; Gordion Special Studies 3. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2005. xvi + 179 pp., 237 figures (113 on CD-ROM). Cloth. $59.95. The responsibility and the right to publish the Gordion seals were obtained 50 years ago by Edith Porada; she never accomplished the task. Porada maintained a con tracted contrai over many seal collections in U.S. museums and private collections, as well as a number derived from excavations, thereby preventing anyone else from publish ing them; and, indeed, some remain unpublished. Fortu nately (at last), a study of the Gordion seals, most of which were excavated decades ago, was undertaken by E. Dusin berre and is now published. We are pleased to have another good Gordion monograph but miss several others assigned and accepted by a number of Gordion Team scholars de cades ago?viz., the architecture of the Early Phrygian and the Middle Phrygian periods, the Middle Phrygian fres coes, the K?c?k H?y?k fortress. There are three chapters in this book. The first is a brief, adequate overview of the Gordion excavations and the cultures identified in the stratigraphical sequences. "For the purposes of this study" Dusinberre accepts the new chronology asserted by the Gordion Team, namely, that based on new C-14 analysis, the Early Phrygian (EP) settlement was destroyed not ca. 700 b.c. as previously thought, but in the late ninth century B.c.; and the next, the Middle Phrygian (MP) settlement was built beginning in "the decades around 800 bce" (pp. 4, 10, 12, 43; the Gor dion Team claimed the destruction occurred between 830 and 800 b.c.). The evidence for the new chronology came into existence in 2001, not 1988 (p. 4; here, cryptically, new evidence is noted as forthcoming, but not explained). Dusinberre's chronology is announced, not demonstrated, presumably because she is not primarily a Phrygian spe cialist. I have rejected the new C-14-based chronology (Muscarella 2003), because I argue it does not reflect ar chaeological reality; I continue to posit the ca. 700 b.c. destruction date. She also (p. 8) claims an 1100-950 b.c. floruit date for the pre-EP, Early Iron Age period. I accept the initial date but suggest that the terminal one is too high by a century (Muscarella 1995: 94). Comments', (p. 12): The remarkable, thick, labor-inten sive clay foundation level laid over the EP settlement by the MP builders is not related formally with what oc curred at the Median-period site of Nush-i Jan in western Iran. This site was not built on "clean" soil, but directly upon a prominent rock outcrop. Eventually parts of the site were carefully (ritually?) buried with bricks and shale. Brass was known at Gordion in the EP as well as in the MP period. And that the presence of brass at Gordion "may perhaps account for the legend of Midas' " golden touch" (in the EP period!) was discussed by many of us at Gordion and elsewhere for decades. (p. 13): The socketed bronze trilobite arrowheads in the MP period are not "characteristic Persian" artifacts and thus cannot be singled out as evidence of "the arrival of the Achaemenid army." Those recovered stuck in the walls of the important (and still unpublished) K?c?k H?y?k may indeed have been shot by an Achaemenian army, but sock eted arrows were in fact used by many polities in the Near East from the seventh century b.c. onward. The second chapter, "The Seals of Gordion," is a sum mary of the loci of the 114 seals and sealings recovered from the Late Bronze Age down to the Hellenestic period, and their functions. Of interest is the rarity of seals in the EP (possibly two, and one egyptianizing scarab), given the existence of a destruction level with artifacts and unplun dered tumuli burials. This scarcity could have been further discussed; the longer-lasting MP period had only 13, pos sibly 14 examples.</page><page sequence="2">88 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 345 Comments: (p. 22): I think it is forced to claim as im portant that the three seals from the EP bear no geometric patterns or anthropomorphic figures?though one indeed does bear a geometric pattern (cat. no. 18)! The antithetical Achaemenian kings on cat. no. 33 are not represented in a mirror image: left and right arms are positioned appropri ately for facing individuals. The triangular object sketched on cat. no. 39 cannot be a parasol: its position is upside down to that of a parasol. (p. 23): For the contexts of the MP South Cellar, Dus inberre (also p. 43) cites De Vries's dating of the earliest pottery there to the late eighth century, which to her gives the "advent" for the beginning date of the MP period. And on p. 45, a seal in the lowest level is dated to the end of the eighth century (which is indeed close to its actual date!). Dusinberre's conclusions reveal confusion. Since the EP destruction level's date is mandated by the Gordion Team, and accepted by Dusinberre, as commencing ca. 830-800 B.c., and if the MP settlement was constructed shortly thereafter, how then can late eighth-century B.c. Greek im ported pottery here support the mandated chronology of the advent of the MP?ca. 800 b.c.e. (a flaw in the chro nology conclusions)? Also, no evidence is presented to support the assertion that Tumulus P is dated 770 b.c.: ac cording to stylistic analysis and dendrochronological evi dence, Tumulus P was constructed close to Tumulus MM, post ca. 740 b.c. Chapter 3 is the core of the book, the catalog of the 114 seals recovered. Dusinberre gives us full information on their loci, size, material, descriptions, and discussions with parallels when available, and previous publications; each seal is illustrated with a sketch and files of photos on CD-ROM. The illustrations were drawn by the author (p. ix), although for some time I thought they were made by different hands, reflecting different drawing skills and techniques, none of archaeological quality (e.g., the man ner employed of using double lines to indicate incisions confuses understanding the scene illustrated). Most are rendered in a cursory rather than accurate manner (judging where possible from the CD-ROM photos). They are sketches, not drawings, which give merely a general sense of the scene, and which in no case can be used for stylistic purposes?a fact that should have been noted. I tried to match up the photos and drawings, and where possible (i.e., having a relatively clear image) recognized a diffi culty, namely, that many of the drawings did not reflect the realia of the photos. Also, to my eyes, most of the photos on the CD-ROM are unclear. Note also that the drawings are of the seal impressions while the photos are of the seals themselves (p. 30), thus are shown in re versed positions. Sometimes it is difficult and time con suming to match them up, which, indeed, cannot always be accomplished. The writing is clear and direct, straightforward, and to the point. There are too many "personal communication" citations (not uncommon in Gordion staff publications)? which one cannot check. Aside from the nature of the illus trations, Dusinberre has accomplished the task presented to her.
