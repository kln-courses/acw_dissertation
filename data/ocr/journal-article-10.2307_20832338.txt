<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mind, Self, and Human-Animal Joint Action Clinton R. Sanders* University of Connecticut Because Herbert Blumer maintained that symbolic interactionism was use fui in examining all realms of social behavior, and advocated what Martin Hammersley refers to as "critical commonsensism" this paper focuses on one of the most common contemporary social relationships?that between people and companion animals. I first examine the basis for Blumefs (like Mead before him and many interactionist scholars today) exclusion of nonhuman animals from consideration as "authentic" social actors. Primarily employing the recent work of interactionists Eugene Myers, Leslie Irvine, Janet and Steven Alger, and Clinton Sanders, this paper advocates the reasonableness of regarding nonhuman animals as "minded," in that mind, as Gubrium emphasizes, is a social construction that arises out of interaction. Similarly, I maintain that animals possess an admittedly rudimentary "self." Here I focus special attention on Irvine's dis cussion of those "self experiences" that are independent of language and arise out of interaction. Finally, I discuss "joint action" as a key element of people's relationships with companion animals as both the animal and human attempt to assume the perspective of the other, devise related plans of action and definitions of object, and fit together their particular (ideally, shared) goals and collective actions. I stress the ways in which analytic attention to human-animal relationships may expand and enrich the understanding of issues of central sociological interest. As constructed by Herbert Blumer on a foundation largely established by George Herbert Mead, symbolic interactionism offers a unique1 and compelling perspective on social life. Central to interactionist thought are Blumers key propositions: "human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings that things have for them"; "the meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with onesfillows"; and "meanings are handled in, and modified through, an inter pretive process used by the person in dealing with the things he encounters" (Blumer 1969: 2, emphasis mine).2 In these elemental propositions Blumer makes the assump tions that only "human beings" engage in the construction of meaning; that "human being" and "person" are synonymous; and that social interaction based on the com munication, cooperative shaping, and utilization of shared meaning is possible only between and among humans. In so doing, Blumer relegates nonhuman animals to the category of "physical" rather than "social" objects (Blumer 1969: 10), and excludes *An earlier version of this paper was presented at the joint Symbolic Interaction and Ethnographic Research and North Central Sociological Association Conferences, Pittsburgh, PA, April 7-10, 2005.1 appreciate the assistance of Steve Carlton-Ford, Scott Grills, and three anonymous reviewers.

Blumers lack of attention to animals is understandable given the central theoreti cal place of language in his perspective and the foundational role Mead s preexisting discussions played in his theoretical orientation. For Mead, animals, lacking the abil ity to employ linguistic symbols, acted and interacted solely on the more elemental and limiting basis of gesture. As he put it: Gestures may be either conscious (significant) or unconscious (nonsignificant). The conversation of gestures is not significant below the human level, because it is not conscious, that is, not self-conscious (though it is conscious in the sense of involving feelings or sensations). An animal as opposed to a human form, in indicating something to, or bringing out a meaning for, another form, is not at the same time indicating or bringing out the same thing or meaning to or for himself, for the animal has no mind, no thought, and hence there is no mean ing here in the significant or self-conscious sense. A gesture is not significant when the response of another organism to it does not indicate to the first organ ism what the second organism is responding to. (1964: 168) Mead believed that animals were mindless since thought was dependent on the actors ability to say. Consequently, animals lacked a self since they were unable to engage in the processes of defining situations and taking the role of the other that constituted "authentic" social interactions that gave rise to the actors self definition. For Mead, human-animal exchanges were premised on anthropomorphic delusion. As he maintained: We, of course, tend to endow our domestic animals with personality, but as we get insight into their conditions we see there is no place for this sort of impor tation of the social process into the conduct of the individual. They do not have the mechanism for it?language. So we say that they have no personality, they are not responsible for the social situation in which they find themselves. .. . We put personalities into the animals, but they do not belong to them. . . . And yet the common attitude is that of giving them just such personalities as our own. We talk to them and in our talking to them we act as if they had the sort of inner world that we have. (1962: 182-183)3 Blumers (and Meads) anthropocentric exclusion of animals from the realms of minded action, meaning construction, and "authentic" interaction has recently been challenged both by interactionist scholars actively engaged in investigating human animal relationships and by writers not directly associated with human-animal stud ies. Hammersley (1989: 128-129), for example, criticizes Blumer and interactionism for disregarding animal behavior and ignoring its potential for expanding an under standing of human motivation. More recently, Prus (1997: 96) has advocated atten tion to "life form objects" and human definitions of and consequent interactions with them. Nonetheless, criticism of attending to human-animal exchanges contin ues both outside of the symbolic interactionist community (e.g., Perrow 2000) and</page><page sequence="3">322 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS within it. Recently, Meitzer has dismissed attention to the interactional, mental, and behavioral abilities of animals as an exercise in anthropomorphizing since animals engage in behavior, he maintains, that is merely "automatic, immediate, and direct reaction of a stimulus-response or conditioned response type" (2003: 258). Similarly, Dennis Waskul, in a listserve exchange focused on animal abilities, recently observed: [Personally, I simply cannot accept this notion of animals (other than humans) possessing a mind or self. I find some of the recently published works on this interesting, but I remain deeply skeptical. It is the human mind that conjures these fictions . . . and THAT is the key difference. Because animals do not, and cannot (I argue), wonder what humans (or any other organism) are "thinking," they do not (and cannot) posses a mind or self. If animals could do these things they wouldn't act like they do. ... I think the classic portrayal of these things as uniquely human is quite central and significant. Sure we can interact with ani mals and animals can act back?but so does my computer, my .. . pickup truck, and a whole host of utterly inanimate objects (emphases in the original).4 In the following discussion I take at face value Blumer's (1969: 67) position that "symbolic interactionism is able to cover the full range of the generic forms of human association" and question the linguicentric interactionist orthodoxy that routinely excludes animals and their interactions with human coactors from serious attention. Drawing primarily on the ethnographic work of Janet and Steven Alger, Leslie Irvine, Eugene Myers, and Clinton Sanders?analysts of human-animal relationships who overtly employ an interactionist perspective?I extend Blumerian interactionism to construct elements of an interactionist "sociozoology"5 that casts animals as "acting units," expands the concept of the "person," presents mind and self as not based solely on linguistic capabilities or as uniquely human, and examines forms of joint action that involve intersubjective exchanges between humans and other animals. In so doing, I take to heart what Hammersley (1989: 131-135) refers to as Blumer's "crit ical commonsensism," which regards commonsense as providing a useful and reliable entry into the world of everyday experience. I maintain that it is through the analytic and methodological valuing of commonsense and the practical ways in which it shapes our understanding of situations and the interactions that take place within them that we can best construct a view of social life that is immediate, comprehensi ble, and includes all of the associations that constitute it. ANIMAL MIND In constructing an understanding of mind and mindedness, Blumerian interaction ism rejects both dualism (the analytic separation of the actor's body and mind) and individualistic psychologies in which social processes are viewed as produced by mind (Meitzer 2003: 253-254). Further, interactionism rejects a computational or infor mation-processing view of mind that focuses on the manipulation of abstract mental representations to the exclusion of emotions, body awareness, and other elements of minded experience (Dutton and Williams 2004: 212, 217). Finally, interactionism</page><page sequence="4">MIND, SELF, AND HUMAN-ANIMAL JOINT ACTION 323 rejects the separation of mind from self and society in that mindedness presupposes a self that arises out of the social exchanges that constitute society (Blumer 1969: 78-89; Meitzer 2003: 254-255; Prus 1996: 52-54). Nonetheless, Blumer, like Mead before him and most interactionists who followed, largely regards mind as an inter nal conversation premised on the minded actor s ability to employ significant symbols as the medium of interaction with the self. As Mead (1962: 47) put it: "Only in terms of gestures as significant symbols is the existence of mind or intelligence possible; for only in terms of gestures which are significant symbols can thinking?which is sim ply an internalized or implicit conversation of the individual with himself by means of such gestures?take place." For over a decade, a growing number of interactionist sociologists have sought to establish an orientation toward mind that deemphasizes this view of mindedness as a linguistic phenomenon and returns to an understanding of mind as the outcome of social interaction and social experience. Examining the interactional worlds of people with Alzheimers disease (Gubrium 1986), those with severe physical and mental dis abilities (Bogdan and Taylor 1989; Goode 1994), infants (Kaye 1982; Stern 1985), and nonhuman animals, researchers have called into question the centrality of language use to mindedness and have emphasized the interactional process of "doing mind" (Dutton and Williams 2004; Sanders 1993). As Dutton and Williams (2004: 215-216) observe: The attribution of meaning or intention to behavior hinges crucially on the extent to which such behavior is considered meaningful within the context of the social relationship. Social relationships actually provide rather clear conditions and parameters for what constitutes "mindful" behavior in contrast to those behaviors that do not seem to merit an intentional explanation because they seem inappropriate within the context of relationship. ... To see (doing mind) as simply folk psychology or a useful social heuristic would be to ignore the importance of the social relationship in structuring and scaffolding intersubjec tive understanding (emphasis in the original). Mind, therefore, as it arises from shared experience, is an element of the meaning structure that those who interact with alingual others devise in understanding and constructing their interactions?an eminently Blumerian position. Caretakers of ani mals, people with severe disabilities, infants, and Alzheimers patients construct a "the ory of mind" that allows them to understand the thinking, emotions, preferences, desires, and intentions of the other (see Alger and Alger 1997; Myers 1998: 99-102; Sanders 1993).6 Once established in the context of an ongoing relationship, these care takers commonly use their knowledge of the other to give voice to the mental content of their alingual coactors. Arluke and Sanders (1996: 61-81) offer a variety of instances of this intersubjective activity, a process they refer to as "speaking for."7 Here, for example, is a quote from Sanders s ethnographic observations in a veterinary clinic. A young male shepherd with long hair is brought into the exam room by an older couple. ... The woman goes on at some length about the dogs long hair and how they hadn't anticipated this when the dog was a puppy.... The dog lies down with his head on the woman's feet and she says, "Oh, I'm so tired. I just</page><page sequence="5">324 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS have to lie down here." Later, as the dog is having his nails trimmed, she (again) speaks for the dog in observing, Oh, I have such nice nails." During much of the time she holds the dogs head tenderly and stares into his eyes. (69)8 The skeptic would, most likely, acknowledge that humans attribute mental activi ties and use these attributions to give voice to the "presumed" thought of a wide vari ety of nonhuman "objects." Disagreement would revolve around whether animals possess a theory of mind to orient their interactions with human and nonhuman coactors. Cognitive ethologists working with primates have amassed considerable evi dence that these "border animals" do indeed hold representations of the intentions, goals, and perspectives of their colleagues (e.g., Cheney and Seyfarth 1990; Povinelli, Nelson, and Boysen 1990). It is difficult to understand how primates, or other highly social beings such as the animals we accept as our companions, could survive very long were they unable, at least at some rudimentary level, to "take the role of the other" and use this theory of mind to shape action and interaction. Take this simple example. My dogs have learned to ring a bell hanging from the door to their fenced-in yard to indicate that they want to go outside.9 It is not uncommon for me not to be immediately responsive to their signaled demands if I am working at the computer or otherwise immediately occupied. After ringing the bell with increased vigor, they will pad down the hall, look fixedly at me as I sit at my desk, and return to the door to ring the bell once again. If this tactic proves ineffec tive, they commonly come back to my study and poke me with a nose as if to say (speaking for), "Are you stupid or deaf?" One could, of course, understand this exchange as premised on simple principles of stimulus and response.10 However, if I take Blumer (1969: 153-170) at his word and agree that commonsense offers the pragmatic understanding of social experience central to symbolic interactionism, it is entirely sensible for me to see my dogs' actions as demonstrating a clear definition of the situation, a minded ability to ascertain and affect the content of my own mind, the recognition that they can affect my action by acting in a particular way, and the capability to devise and act upon a plan of action directed toward achieving an intended outcome.11 In short, from a commonsense perspective, "minding animals," to use Bekoff s (2002) multilayered term, involves the cooperative construction of nonhuman mind as an intersubjective accomplishment that is not dependent upon the animals ability to employ human language.12 As the animals "wordless mind" (Terrace 1987) is produced and understood as an outcome of interaction, both human and animal coactors are able to engage in the practical and elemental social dance that Blumer (1969: 70-77) refers to as "joint action" (a topic upon which I focus in a later section of this discussion). ANIMAL SELF In order for minded activity to exist, the minded actor must possess a self-object with whom to communicate. Symbolic interactionism locates the generation of the self, like the construction of mind, in the context of social interaction. Conscious awareness</page><page sequence="6">MIND, SELF, AND HUMAN-ANIMAL JOINT ACTION 325 entails the actor indicating "things" to his or her self, devising an understanding of the objects so indicated, and using this understanding to shape lines of action (Blumer 1969: 12-13). Even analysts skeptical of the ability of commonsense to provide valid and/or practical representations of experience (e.g., Hilbert 1994) would have a dif ficult time denying that animals are conscious in this sense and routinely involved in this type of interpretive process (see Damasio 1999; Dawkins 1998). Although the animal self is a focus of attention for most interactionists involved in exploring human-animal relationships (e.g., Alger and Alger 2003: 76-89; Sanders 1999: 9-15, 137-140), Irvine (2004a; 2004b) and Myers (1998) offer the most detailed discussions of the issue. Both locate the animal self in the context of the phys ical body (cf., Cooley 1964: 168-200) and emotional experience; see it as emerging from, and displayed through, goal-directed behavior (Irvine 2004b: 8; Myers 1998: 49-50); and deemphasize the importance of linguistic ability (Irvine 2004b: 9; Myers 1998: 6-8). Like mind, the self is presented as a product that emerges through rou tine interactions within the context of relationships. Using a conceptual foundation provided by William James (1961 [1892]) and fol lowing the lead of Stern (1985) and Myers (1998: 74-78), Irvine (2003; 2004a: 126-146; 2004b) details four "self-experiences" that are independent of language, arise out of interaction, and generate the "core self." As she puts it: In the model of self I am using, in order for animals to [participate in the cre ation of self], they must themselves be subjective Others. How can we sense their subjective presence? As with other people, we cannot observe subjectivity directly. We perceive it indirectlyr, during interaction. .. . [T]he case can be made for the presence of these [self] experiences among animals, who have the same structures of the brain, nervous system, musculature, and memory [as do humans]. Whereas human development takes us into a stage of language acqui sition that adds to these basic experiences, the experiences themselves are pr? verbal. (2004b: 9, emphasis in the original) Irvine's first self-experience is "agency," the actors recognition that he/she/it has control over his/her/its actions. This awareness leads to an understanding that one is differentiated from the other and that, through purposive action, one can have impact on others' actions. For example, my Newfoundlands, like most dogs, are fond of rou tine. An academic schedule allows me on most days to take my dogs for their daily walk between ten and noon. Around this time, the dogs become restive and begin to follow me around as I move about the house, all the while watching closely for indi cations that I am making walk preparations. As it grows later, the youngest dog will escalate the exchange by occasionally poking me with her nose and whining. The antic ipation and attempts to hurry me along persuasively demonstrate that the dogs not only have some sense of time but that they also recognize that their actions can shape my behavior in ways they define as desirable. In short, they provide evidence that they recognize their own agency and are able to take the role of the (human) other. Irvine's second self-experience, "coherence," focuses attention on the actor's physi cal self, "the entity to which ... agency belongs" (2004a: 133). She emphasizes that</page><page sequence="7">326 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS coherence is demonstrated by the animals ability to recognize, and orient action toward, specific animal and human others and by the activity of self-concealment. Hiding is an "indication that an animal is aware of itself as an object in the world sep arate from the physical environment and from others" (Sanders 1999: 137). Within the human-animal relationship, the coherence of the unique animal self is solidified and symbolized through the cultural process of naming (Irvine 2004b: 12; Sanders 2003:411). "Affectivity"?possessing feelings/emotions associated with experience?is the third element of the core self discussed by Irvine. Here she distinguishes between "categor ical affects" (self-experiences such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and so forth that we typically think of as emotion) and "vitality affects" (ways of feeling such as mood and vitality). Based on knowledge of the companion animals common emotional responses to particular situations and the ability to read the bodily gestures associated with these responses, the caretaker is able to understand and behave appropriately toward the animal and, over time, construct an understanding of what the animal is "like" (Irvine 2004a: 137-139). Through interactional experience with the animal others affective self, caretakers come to see the animal has having a unique and iden tifiable "personality." As one of Sanders s (1999: 30) interviewees put it: "The only way I can describe the relationship [with my dog] is to use human terms. He certainly has as much personality as any of the people I know. I just use many of the same indi cators to know what he is thinking and feeling that I use to understand my wife or other people." Finally, Irvine emphasizes "self-history" as a central organizing element of the animal s core self. Past events and experiences, knowledge of others and places are, she maintains, preserved in nonverbal memory and provide the basis for self-in-relationship. In answering the presumed behaviorist criticism that responses to past experience, such as an animals display of fear when entering the veterinarians office, are simply the result of conditioning, Irvine calls upon Allen and BekofFs (1997: 56-62) distinction between behavior that is "stimulus bound" (i.e., motivated by external stimuli) and that which is "stimulus free" (i.e., prompted by internal factors). Despite the seduc tive simplicity of stimulus-bound explanations of animal behavior, she argues that many of the experiences we have with animals persuasively indicate that their behav ior is frequently prompted by memory and evaluation of the immediate situation. As an example, she observes that her cats prefer sleeping on a fleece blanket and acknowl edges that the "comfort" they associate with the blanket is, to some degree, the con sequence of conditioning. However, were she to lay out the blanket in the veterinary examining room (a setting in which her cats exhibit considerable fear), she doubts that they would respond to it in the same way they do when it rests on the floor in her home (Irvine 2004b: 14-15). Shared routines also are a key element of self-history. Routine activities?especially feeding and play?constitute temporal high points in the shared flow of events that constitute the regular interactions between caretakers and companion animals. These routines, then, come, over time, to be anticipated, remembered, and ritualized within the relationship. For example, I always feed my own dogs between seven and eight in</page><page sequence="8">MIND, SELF, AND HUMAN-ANIMAL JOINT ACTION 327 the morning. As in the case of going for walks described above, when this time approaches the dogs begin to watch me carefully and to follow me from place to place. If I am late, they will begin to make "impatient" noises and look longingly at the metal food bowls kept on the kitchen counter. When I take the bowls into the basement where their food is stored, they wait expectantly at the top of the stairs and then mill about and bark with anticipation as I prepare their meals. Over time, Cynder, the older of my Newfoundlands, has devised a unique postprandial routine. After I put the other dog out to take care of elimination, Cynder takes her bowl over to a place by the couch and waits expectantly. I go to her, rub her ears, and say a few kind words. After this special attention she lies down and chews on her bowl for a few minutes until she falls asleep. I then return her bowl to the counter and let the other dog back into the house. It is clear from her demeanor that this is an enjoyable and expected routine. If I am distracted or busy and do not follow the established pattern, she will continue to sit with the bowl in her mouth and watch me until I realize my failure to meet her expectations. This routine, together with a number of others, is a component of our shared history. We all remember how routines have played out in the past and structure present interactions on the basis of these memories, we antici pate the exchanges in the future, and Cynder s personal shaping of the routine is part of my knowledge of her unique selfhood (cf. Shapiro 1990). The animal self, therefore, is constituted by the animal-actors recognizing he or she is distinct from others and can engage in volitional behavior; that moods and feel ings are connected to experiences, places, and relationships; and that past events are relevant to the emotional experience of and physical response to current situations. In the context of an ongoing relationship, caretakers construct an understanding of the animals self and use this understanding to interact appropriately and practically. Like human-with-human interaction, exchanges between people and their animal com panions is a mutual interplay of discrete selves. Seen in this way, the self is a process with a past, present, and future and an intersubjective accomplishment rather than simply an object that an actor "indicates." As Clark (1984: 47) explains: To have ... a concept [of self] one must recognize other beings in the world, distinguish what is self and what is not-self, and lay claim to pasts and futures of the single being one is. To have a concept of self is, in part at least, to do these things: to show awareness of the world as being more than ones immediate per ception of it, to recognize other beings as being the same as some past acquain tances, to admit responsibility for past action, and to intend some future. (See also Myers 1998: 58-61.) ANIMALS AND JOINT ACTION For Blumer, society is constituted by interaction (Blumer 1969: 7-8). Following Mead, Blumer distinguishes between symbolic and nonsymbolic interaction. In the latter type cointeractants engage in a "conversation of gestures" in which there is shared meaning and mutual role-taking, but interactants respond directly to each</page><page sequence="9">328 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS others behavior in the process of cooperatively constructing joint action. According to Blumer (1969: 9): "the gesture has meaning for both the person who makes it and for the person to whom it is directed. When the gesture has the same meaning for both, the two parties understand each other. ... [The gesture] signifies what the per son to whom it is directed is to do; it signifies what the person who is making the ges ture plans to do; and it signifies the joint action that is to arise by the articulation of the acts of both." Blumer, like Mead, would maintain that animal-with-animal, human-with-animal, and some simple forms of human-with-human interaction are premised on this com municative foundation. But, for Blumer, most human interaction is symbolic in that it involves interactants subjectively interpreting the meaning of each others behaviors and acting (rather than responding) on the basis of this understanding. The conse quence of this symbolic exchange is a more complex form of "interlinked" action that is repetitive, stable, and grounded on emergent rules (Blumer 1969: 19). This "authentic" form of joint action is made possible as interactants share basically simi lar definitions of the situation and possess an understanding of each others goals, plans of action, and definitions of objects within the situational context (Blumer 1969: 62, 96-97). In other words, for Blumer joint action is a dance of minded selves?an interpretive fitting together of lines of action (Blumer 1969: 70-77)? operating in the context of shared perspectives (cf. Prus 1997: 6-8). Again, I maintain that Blumer s exclusion of nonhuman animals from the realm of "authentic" (i.e., human-like) joint action is based simply on anthropocentric and linguicentric articles of faith. Belief in the unique character of human joint action is on shaky ground given the growing body of research-based literature being produced by interactionist scholars concerned with human-animal relationships and interac tions. This work clearly demonstrates that, within the context of the ongoing, histor ically constructed, emotionally rich relationships between people and their animal companions, humans and animals do share perspectives and are routinely involved in joint action. The ability of animals to take the role of the other and act accordingly in order to achieve certain goals is illustrated by a veterinarians description of how his dog deceptively defines a particular definition of the situation for personal gain. I believe that dogs think. My dogs play a game called "bone." One of them will get the rawhide bone and take it over to the other one and try to get him to try and get it. Or one will try to get the bone if the other one has it. One day I was watching and the youngest one was trying to get the bone without much luck. So he goes over to the window and begins to bark like someone is coming up the driveway. The other dog drops the bone and runs over to the window and the puppy goes and gets the bone. There wasn't anyone in the driveway, it was just a trick. (Sanders 1999: 24) The ability of dogs and other companion animals to share perspectives and sit uational definitions in both animal-with-animal (as in the above) and human with-animal situations is demonstrated by what Myers (1998: 93-95) refers to as "interattentionality," the sharing of attention and bodily experience. One indication</page><page sequence="10">MIND, SELF, AND HUMAN-ANIMAL JOINT ACTION 329 of animals abilities to assume the perspective of the other is seen in the common phe nomenon of gaze-following. Researchers have frequently noted this empathetic activ ity in observations of peoples interactions with dogs. For example, Sanders (1999: 114) notes the importance of gaze in his autoethnographic observations of his expe rience with his own dogs. When Emma and Isis look at me they usually pay attention to my eyes. I have noticed on walks how important looking is to them. A common way that one will communicate to the other that she wants to play is by staring. During play they have a variety of ways of signaling "time out." In addition to stopping and avidly sniffing someplace, a player can effectively suspended the game by star ing fixedly off into the middle distance. The other dog typically responds to this move by looking to see if there is actually anything important to look at. They do the same with me. If on the walk I stop and look in a particular direction, they will stop, glance at me, and gaze off in the direction I am looking. This seems a fairly clear indication of their elemental ability to put themselves into my perspective. In a literal sense they attempt to assume my "point of view." If I look at something they conclude that it is probably something important.13 In addition to the "social force" (Dutton and Williams 2004: 218) of mutual gaze and shared attention, sociologists involved in human-animal studies have focused on play as the interactional situation in which joint action is readily apparent. Play involves interaction that is apparently purposeless; mutually regarded as separated from everyday, practical, "serious" endeavors; and pursued in order to achieve intrin sic pleasure instead of being directed toward instrumental ends (see Irvine 2001: 153-154; 2004a: 166-171).14 Mechling (1989: 313), for example, emphasizes animal-human play as a communicative interaction when he describes playing with his dog Sunshine. The game of fetch was truly interactive. I was not always in control of the game. Sometimes Sunshine would fetch the ball but stop on the way back to me some ten feet away. He would begin a slow retriever stalk, then drop the ball in front of him and assume the familiar canine "play bow"?forepaws extended flat on the ground, the body sloping upward toward his erect hindquarters, tail wag ging. This is the canine invitation to play. In this case, however, we were already engaged in a game, so his message to me was that he, too, could exert some power and control in the game.15 We can see that within the mutually defined situational "frame" (GofTman 1974) of play?in addition to feeding (Alger and Alger 2003: 57-58,63-64; Irvine 2004a: 153-155), the solicitation and acceptance of physical contact, and the other rou tinized exchanges between people and their animal companions show the basic ele ments of joint action described by Blumer. Here human and animal cointeractants "[align their] individual actions... by interpreting or taking into account each others actions" (Blumer 1969: 82). In so doing, people and animals develop and play out what Collins (1989) calls "natural interaction rituals" as they share attention, mutual awareness, emotions, and obligations.</page><page sequence="11">330 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS Within the context of this joint action people and animals create, in turn, a "pri vate culture" (Fine 1981: 267) consisting of established routines, knowledge of and feeling for each other, and expectations about the course of interaction. As Smuts (2001: 302) observes, "with ... prolonged exposure, members of two different species can co-create shared conventions that help to regulate interspecies encounters." What is of central importance to this interactionally constructed culture and the collective action it encompasses is that, although these structures and processes involve sym bolic meanings shared by both humans and animals, they exist exclusive of the abil ity of all interactants to employ linguistic symbols. CONCLUSION Based on the basic precepts offered by Blumer, symbolic interactionism offers both an analytic window through which to view social life and methodological guidelines for opening that window. Through direct personal engagement with the social world constituted by interaction (Blumer 1969: 24-26), taking the role of "acting units" (be they human or nonhuman), and attending to personal experiences within inter actional situations (Blumer 1969: 39, Prus 1996: 68-69), we build a descriptive (albeit tentative) understanding of how social exchanges are structured and played out (Blumer 1969: 18; Prus 1997: 9). Of central importance is the Blumerian principle that everyday ("reliable") commonsense (Hammersley 1989: 126), when combined with intimate familiarity with the actors and phenomena of interest, provides an ade quate foundation for this understanding.16 Given Blumers faith in what Hammersley (1989: 131-135) refers to as "critical commonsensism" and his belief that symbolic interactionism provides an adequate ground for understanding all forms of social relationships (Blumer 1969: 67), it seems eminently reasonable to conclude that building an interactionist view of human-animal associations is both a viable endeavor and a means by which the interactionist perspec tive may be developed, enlarged, and changed (Hammersley 1989:219). Central to this worthy endeavor are the methodological approach and analytic perspective related to Blumerian commonsensism. Interactionists working in human-animal studies consis tently advocate and employ what cognitive ethologists call "critical" or "interpretive" anthropomorphism (Burghardt 1991). This orientation acknowledges that all system atic understanding of social others flows from the analysts adopting the perspective of those with whom he or she interacts. Through imaginatively taking the role of animal others and critically employing insights gained from ones personal experience with and knowledge of the intersubjective groundings of everyday (human) social life, we may build a rich and nuanced understanding of how nonhuman minds and selves are con structed and operate within the context of intimate exchanges with their human com panions. For, as the ethologist Margaret Nice succinctly puts it: "A necessary condition for success ... is a continuous sympathetic observation of an animal under as natural conditions as possible. To some degree, one must transfer oneself into the animal s situ ation and inwardly partake in its behavior" (quoted in Lawrence 1989: 118).17</page><page sequence="12">MIND, SELF, AND HUMAN-ANIMAL JOINT ACTION 331 Interactionist scholars who focus on human relationships with other animals have, I submit, taken Blumer and his interpreters at their word. Possessing "informal and intimate knowledge" (Costali 1998) of their own and others' everyday experience with animals?what Cox and Ashford (1998) refer to as "epistemic authority"?these scholars are constructing an enlarged understanding of group life within a mixed species social world. What has emerged, as demonstrated above, is a portrait of non human animals as minded and self-aware participants in collective action with their human associates. But exploring human interactions with nonhuman animals holds promise for more than simply shedding substantive light on human-animal relationships. Analytic attention to people's interactions with animals offers a route to expanding the conventional sociological conception of mind as a language-dependent, inter nalized conversation. Instead, mind may be regarded as an intersubjective accom plishment, the outcome of interaction between intimates (Sanders 2003). Similarly, exploration of human-animal interaction has already reshaped, and will continue to expand, the sociological understanding of the self. The process of constructing a self and the emotionally rich experience of self-awareness can no longer be seen as depending upon a social actors ability to use words. Instead, the self may be under stood as arising from the actor's recognition of his/her/its ability to control the phys ical and social world, experience emotions, and realize that purposive action comes from a unique and ongoing entity. In addition, as self aware social actors, nonhuman animals come to act as what Irvine (2004a: 162-166) refers to as "resources for self construction." Interaction with animals provides people with information and expe riences they can use to define the roles they enact and the situations in which they find themselves. Seeing animals as minded selves?as participants in the interactional process of "doing mind" (Dutton and Williams 2004) and as social actors whose personhood is constructed within this process (Sanders 1995)?also demands an ethical r??valua tion of our relationships with them.18 Knowing animals and their central place in our culture and everyday experiences leads, of necessity, to appreciating their abilities, including them in sociological discussion, and affording them the respect and care we offer to the others with whom we share our lives.

NOTES 1. Maines (2001) persuasively argues that symbolic interactionism is not a "unique" perspec tive in the sense that its theoretical precepts are central to sociology. 2. Prus (1997:11-17) expands these basic principles. 3. For extended critical discussions of Mead s perspective on animals and his single-minded focus on language see Alger and Alger 1997: 67-71, 2003: 203-206; Irvine 2003, 2004a: 120-125, 2004b; Myers 1998: 120-125, 2003; Sanders 1999: 117-119. 4. Retrieved January 4, 2005, from http://venus.soci.niu.edu/-achives/SSITALK/ aug04/0276.html. 5. Arluke (2003) prefers the older term "ethnozoology" I see "sociozoology," "anthrozoology," and "ethnozoology" as equally descriptive and serviceable. 6. The concept of "theory of mind" was originated by the primatologists Premack and Woodruff (1978). 7. GofFman (1981: 86-87) calls this activity "say-foring." He recognizes that say-foring is a general feature of relationships between those who are competent and those who are defined as less, or minimally, competent. He uses infants and companion animals as examples. [W]e can with impunity address words in public to a pet, presumably on the grounds that the animal can appreciate the affective element of the talk, if nothing else. We extend the same sort of regard to infants.... Moreover, special forms of talk are involved: for exam ple, . . . mimicked babytalk projected as the talk the incompetent would employ were it able to speak ["say-foring"]. With reference to the relationship between parents and infants, Kaye (1982:182) refers to this minding interaction as the "he says phenomenon." For an extended discussion of the ethical and policy issues involved in speaking for incompetents, see Buchanan and Brock (1989). 8. For examples of this process within the context of adult-infant interaction see Brazelton (1984) and in interactions between caretakers and people with severe disabilities see Pollner and McDonald-Wilder (1985). Myers (1998) provides a variety of examples of children speak ing for the animals they encountered in a nursery school. Also see Irvine's (2001) recent dis cussion of this "minding" phenomenon in the context of human-animal play. 9. Interestingly, for new dogs in my household this knowledge is not the result of my train ing. Young dogs have learned from observing more experienced animals what the bell "means" and the typical human activity ringing it produces. 10. But, as Hearne (1987:58) observes: To the extent that die behaviorist manages to deny any belief in the dogs potential for believing, intending, meaning, etc., there will be no flow of intention, meaning, believing, hoping going on. .. .The behaviorists dog will not only seem stupid, she will be stupid. 11. For extended discussions of animal mind, see Crist 1999; Griffin 1992; Hauser 2000; and Rogers 1997. 12. The psychologist and dog trainer Stanley Coren observes that his own dogs have a "recep tive vocabulary" of around sixty-five words or phrases (Coren 1994:114). On the basis of the</page><page sequence="14">MIND, SELF, AND HUMAN-ANIMAL JOINT ACTION 333 dog intelligence tests he has devised he finds that, relative to humans, dogs have an 1Q some where in the 60s. 13. This is related to the gaze-related activity that Irvine (2004a: 155-158) refers to as "check ing back." See also Dutton and Williams 2004:214-215. 14. Erving Goffman (1997) emphasizes the central role of playing games and having fun in human social life. He describes games as socially sanctioned, nonserious, face-to-face exchanges in which interactants share situational definitions. 15. For additional discussion and examples of human-animal play see Irvine 2004a: 168-171 ; Mitchell and Edmonson 1999; Myers 1998: 117-143. Shapiro (1990: 186) emphasizes the interactional complexity and intersubjective nature of human-animal play in his observations of playing with his own dog: At first glance, this activity hardly seems worth mentioning?a simple game of keep away and chase. However, on reflection, the invitation ritual, the play itself, the implicit rules and regulations governing the legitimate play area, permitted and prohibited moves, and the object of the game, as well as the conditions ending it, were all quite intricate and yet easily maintained by both players. Even more subtle were the postures, feints, and deceits, the half-executed moves during what might look, to the uninitiated, like time-outs from the game. 16. Similarly, Silverman (1997) advocates replacing the anthropocentric "commonsense of sci ence" with "ordinary commonsense" derived from everyday experience when attempting to understand the perspectives of nonhuman animals and our interactions with them. 17. For discussions of "critical anthropormorphism" as it is advocated and used within socio logical studies of human-animal relationships, see Irvine (2004a:68-73) and Sanders (1999: 140-141). See also Shapiros (1990) related discussion of "kinesthetic empathy." 18. For discussions of the moral and ethical implications of an interactionist understanding of nonhuman animals see Alger and Alger (2003: 199-211); Arluke and Sanders (1996: 52-57); and Irvine (2004a: 172-184).
