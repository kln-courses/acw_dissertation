<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOTHIC PAINTING IN SWEDEN AND NORWAY BY AYMER VALLANCE LTHOUGH repeated references have already been made in these pages both by Professor Lethaby and Mr. Tristram to Herr Lindblom's' volume1, it has not yet been treated in its entirety. No apology, then, for the present notice is required. The author's thesis is briefly as follows:-- Byzantine or Romanesque painting, which he associates with round-arched architecture, gave place to Gothic painting about 1250, when, to sum up the situation in three words, toute tension disparu. From that time onward until 1350 approximately, two parallel streams of influence, those of England and France respectively, con- tinued to dominate. After the last-named date, however, a more distinctively native style, having taken root, proceeded to develop itself. The scope of Herr Lindblom's book comprises the period between the middle of the i3th and the middle of the 14th century; and the aim of the author, in an exhaustive study, is to determine the extent and importance of the several forces which controlled the art of painting in Sweden and Norway in the course of the century in question. During the first part of the time named, Norway, on account not only of its geographical situation but also of its political conditions, was more advanced than Sweden; but broadly and for practical purposes the arts of the two countries respectively may well be re- garded together as of one. This is particularly true, seeing that the two countries had attained virtually to the same artistic level by the beginning of the 14th century; and any inequality that might previously have existed disappeared from the date of the union of the two kingdoms under one common sovereign in 1319, notwithstanding the political union came to an end in 1355. As to the foreign influences operating in the two countries, Sweden was evangelised from England and Germany; Norway almost exclu- sively from England. "Numbers of Englishmen filled episcopal sees in Norway. Thus, among others, the first bishop of Stavanger was an Englishman, and his cathedral church was dedi.

Another Englishman, Martin, became bishop of Bergen. In fact, from early days an almost constant stream of Christian enterprise flowed north-eastward into Europe from England, from the time of S. Boniface or Winfrid (754) to Bishop Henry of Upsala (Ii50), both of them eminent English saints. Mission- aries like these men, as in the case also of S. Augustine, the apostle of Anglo-Saxon England, did not come alone, but accompanied by a train of assistants, who, when their principals had passed away, would take up and extend their masters' work. They in their turn would keep up a close intercourse with the mother country. Thus the influences and traditions of the land of their origin would prove powerful factors, long after the date of the first establishment of their mission, for generations after the original founders had been gathered to their rest. And so the overseas influences continued energetically to act and react upon the northern peoples. King Haakon (1217 to 1263), the friend and contem- porary of Henry III of England, is said to have built his palace at Bergen on the model of that at Westminster. In Sweden in the I2th century English traditions waned, or rather were eclipsed by the more powerful influence of the great Cistercian order, which was, of course, French in its inception. Although it is true that the Cistercian body, as constituted, was inimical to art in many of its manifestations, nevertheless the intercourse which ;ts introduction established between Scandinavia and Burgundy could not remain confined to eccle- siastics. Sooner or later it was bound to extend to secular circles; and, once Burgundians and Scandinavians had been brought into contact with one another, the arts of the latter would infallibly receive a powerful stimulus. A French mason, Stephen of Bonnueill, was commissioned in 1287 to build the Cathedral of Upsala. The Church of the Apostles at Bergen was erected to receive a fragment of the Crown of Thorns, given by Philip III of France in 1274 to King Magnus of Norway. Some time between 1307 and 1309, the Bishop of Bergen wrote to his brother, then at Poitiers or Orleans, begging him to recommend a skilled artist to paint and execute glass windows. But to enumerate all the instances in which English or French aid was invoked for the artistic uplifting of Scandinavia would occupy far too much space. The chapters on the evolution of style, in which Herr Lindblom traces the rise and development of Gothic painting in Scandinavia, are followed by some useful studies on the iconography of the Life of Our Lord, and the Life and Miracles of Our Lady and of various saints who figure in the art of Norway and Sweden. The system of mural decoration in these two countries is peculiar. Herr Lindblom cites but a couple of instances in which the painting is exe- cuted, as it certainly would be in our own country, direct on to the surface of the ashlar or plastered walls themselves. With these two exceptions only, the interiors are lined with boards throughout, the painting being then applied to the boarding, as a rule in situ. Instances, however, occur of de- corated ceilings in which the fact of the boards being no longer than the limits of a single panel or compartment points to the conclusion that the panels might have been painted as detached pic- tures before being fixed in their proper position. The fact of the boards being of oak, or, for an alternative, of fir, would afford presumptive evi- dence in the first case of their being imported, and in the second case of their being indigenous work. Another remarkable point is the total absence of gilding. When wanted, the effect of gold is obtained by glazing with a transparent yellowish-brown varnish over silver. There are to be found among the paintings described and illustrated by Herr Lindblom many striking parallels to works of known English provenance, while, on the other hand, there are also striking divergencies. Both features may or may not have been in some instances the result of mere accident. In others the resemblance is too close to be the result of anything other than actual copyism. It is known that there existed, and that there were widely used, certain stock pattern books, designed to insure a correct rendering of Christian iconographic details. There were also less formal books or albums of sketches like those of the famous Villard de Honnecourt, Cambrai, in the early part of the 13th century. Certain types of design would again be disseminated by means of such portable works as carved ivories, embroideries, panel paintings and, above all, illu- minated manuscripts. All these factors would tend to produce a standard treatment of essentials by mediaeval artists. When, however, as in the case of certain paintings at Aal, in Norway, for example, two opposite kinds of handling occur in one and the same composition, it is manifest that the whole work, howsoever derivative, cannot properly be said to owe its inspiration to one original or set of originals more than to another. Thus, to quote Herr Lindblom, "the treatment of the folds of the drapery is characterised by lines both hard and angular. The main folds are rendered by long, straight sweeps, and the outline of the bottom of the dresses forms a series of angles. One may note, moreover, shorter and more delicate folds serving to accentuate the contour of the human form, particularly of the legs. The figure of S. Peter, in the group which illustrates the kiss of Judas, supplies an instance of these two diverse modes of rendering drapery folds." Here, then, admittedly two separate and contrasted methods 35</page><page sequence="5">are in operation in a single painting. In instances such as this it is surely unwise to dogmatise too precisely as to the dominance of one school or another, since the balance is as near as may be equal. The wooden church of Aal dated from the latter half of the 13th century. This building, unfortunately, must be spoken of in the past sense, for it was demolished in 188o. On the in- side of the eastern gable wall was a painted Calvary [PLATE, p. 34], in some ways closely analogous to the Rood paintings on boarded tympana still surviving in Britain, e.g., at Winsham, Somer- set; Wenhaston, Suffolk; and the magnificent example at Foulis Easter Collegiate Church, near Dundee. The Christ at Aal is accompanied by the Mary and John in the normal manner, but the painting also comprises two figures of whose occurrence in Rood groups I can recall no British example, viz., the allegorical figures of the Jewish Synagogue at Our Lord's left and of the Christian Church at His right. The latter figure holds the chalice, as is usual in such representations. But in this instance she lifts it to catch the Precious Blood, which, flowing from the pierced right hand of the Crucified, is depicted as running downward along the forearm to the elbow, whence it would drip directly into the chalice underneath. This is a detail entirely unusual. The man in the background, with his finger pointing to his eye, apparently illustrates the same legend of the blinded man which is depicted in the crowded group, already mentioned, at Foulis Easter. The last named is a work of the first half of the I6th century, and is thus upwards of 250 years subse- quent to the Aal painting. The church of R.da in Sweden dates from 1323. Its eastern gable wall comprises two tiers of sub- jects painted on boards [PLATE, p. 34]. In the centre of the upper portion is depicted the Holy Trinity, after the manner which, though condemned by modern judgment as anthropomorphic, was yet a peculiar favourite at one period in pre-Reformation England. Thus, Edward, Prince of Wales, who is known to have cherished a special devotion toward the Trinity, has this very subject painted under the wooden tester which is fixed over his effigy in Canterbury Cathedral. Prince Edward, commonly but erroneously nicknamed the Black Prince, died in 1376. His painted tester, therefore, belongs to a date fifty years or more after that of the paint- ing of the same subject at Rada. The different shapes of the respective surfaces to be occupied demand different treatment. The Trinity at Can- terbury has an evangelistic symbol at each corner. At RAda the Holy Trinity is flanked by the Blessed Virgin and S. John Baptist in adoration, behind whom again, at each extremity of the picture, stands a pair of figures, one of them winged, and both holding lighted tapers in their hands. In the lower tier are represented (on the left) the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and (on the right) the Martyrdoms of S. Peter, S. Paul and S. Andrew. On the north wall, at a corresponding height with the last named subjects, is a subject which is identified as the Dormition of Our Lady [PLATE, p. 31]. The more usual way to treat this subject would be to show Our Lady lying on her death-bed, surrounded by the Apostles, one with a book, one with holy water and sprinkler, another placing a candle in her hand. At Rada, the Blessed Virgin seated on a throne, sinks back into the supporting arms of a group of youthful, beardless figures. This rendering is not a little unusual, but, like the rest of the paintings at Rada, seems to have been borrowed from an illuminated manuscript, possibly of French origin. The frontispiece, the only coloured illustration in the book, affords an excellent idea of the general scheme of polychromatic decoration in R.da Church. There are, beside many line blocks in the text, fifty collotype plates reproducing, together with a quantity of examples of Norwegian and Swedish paintings, a certain number of illumi- nations and other examples from the graphic arts, valuable to the student for purposes of comparison.</page></plain_text>
