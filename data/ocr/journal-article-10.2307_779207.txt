<plain_text><page sequence="1">C6zanne: Words and Deeds* YVE-ALAIN BOIS Translated by Rosalind Krauss What we know about what is called C6zanne's theory we know through snippets (reported conversations or maxims, a few sentences on painting in letters to his son or to young admirers), almost the whole of it dating from the last years of his life. Even further, Cezanne had a rather ambivalent relation to theory itself- never ceasing to speak of its necessity and yet of his mistrust of ready-made theories, which he called doctrines: "I don't have a doctrine like Bernard, but theories are necessary, the sensation and theories."I For him, theory was truly indissociable from practice; based on accumulated experience, it is the logic permitting "the organization of one's sensations" and thus the "realization," that is, the proposition in painting not of a "servile copy," but of a "harmony parallel to nature," an equivalence of relations. Cezanne's remarks on the necessary connection between eye and brain, which must be developed in tandem so as "to arrive at the 'realization,"' are numerous, but perhaps nowhere does he indicate more clearly than in one of his last letters to Aurenche how much what he calls "reflection" concerns the whole gamut of his pictorial means: In your letter you speak of my realization in art. I believe that I attain it more every day, although a bit laboriously. Because if the strong sensation for nature-and certainly I have that vividly-is the necessary basis for all artistic conception and that on which the grandeur and beauty of all future work rests, the knowledge of the means of expressing our emotion is no less essential and is only to be acquired through a very long experience.2 * This essay was first delivered at the symposia held in conjunction with the Cezanne retrospective, organized by the Mus6e d'Orsay (Paris, November 1995) and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (May 1996).

Cezanne's famous doubt about his capacity to "realize" is a worry about the validity of his theory as well, namely about the knowledge he himself could have of his means. I will begin with the very well known. Immediately following his injunction to Bernard according to which one must "treat nature by means of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone, all of it put in perspective," Cezanne adds: Lines parallel to the horizon give breadth, that is, a section of nature or, if you prefer, of the spectacle that the Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus spreads out before our eyes. Lines perpendicular to this horizon give depth. But nature for us humans is more in depth than in surface, whence the necessity to introduce into our light vibrations, represented by the reds and yellows, a sufficient amount of bluish tones, to give the feeling of air.3 We are used to explaining these remarks by attributing them to the classical tenets about monocular perspective and aerial perspective that Cezanne could have read about in a manual of the period. All right. But how do we explain the linkage of the ideas? If the "perpendiculars to this horizon" give us depth, why not be entirely satisfied with recourse to that? Why add "But nature for us humans is more in depth than in surface, whence the necessity to introduce .. . a sufficient amount of bluish tones"? Why this but, and why this supplement of bluish tones? All the more in that Cezanne, if he does make excessive use of blue, rarely seems to adhere to the principle of aerial perspective itself. In terms of their local tone and contours, distant objects are seldom more blue and less well defined than near ones. In fact, what is often very striking in his work, and not only in the late paintings, is the way an object or a colored plane surges forth from the distance like an unexpected arrow to interpellate the spectator by coming toward him. The most arresting example is perhaps in the 1896 Lac d'Annecy, with its prismatic chateau as both "culminating point" of the picture and center of the composition- but this type of violent denial of aerial perspective is frequent from the 1880s onward, notably in the first of the Sainte-Victoires. Commenting on the passage from the letter to Bernard just cited, Theodore Reff has brought to bear a less well known statement by Cezanne to Jean Royere, but has cut something from its opening on which I would, to the contrary, want to insist: You see it .. . It [Sainte-Victoire] is distant from us by a good way, in itself it is rather massive. At the Beaux-Arts you learn, of course, the 3.

Indeed, what do we in fact see there if not a veritable reversal? The surface of the water-the very quintessence of horizontality--not only becomes a perfectly flat wall as in certain landscapes from L'Estaque, particularly the one belonging to Picasso, but a wall striated with vertical lines, those "perpendiculars to the horizon" meant "to give depth" to us. Yet they don't deliver it to us, this depth; they have rather the tendency to deny it and to 4.

This matter of distance seems to have obsessed Cezanne during his last years. Francis Jourdain expressed surprise at hearing him say "that one of his most constant preoccupations was to render the real distance between eye and object sensible."5 This surprise, that we perhaps share, is little abated by the link- age of ideas in these remarks to Karl Ernst Osthaus: "The main thing, in a picture, is to find the correct distance. The color had to express all the ruptures in depth."6 That is: it is up to color to supplement the insufficiencies of linear perspective (in the same way as the "bluish tones" of the atmosphere in the letter of Bernard). We should note in passing that here it is no longer a question of aerial perspective (which presupposes a continuous and homogenous space), but of ruptures, which strikes me as being closer to Cezanne's painting. I nonetheless leave to one side this practice of "depth through color," so admired by Matisse and so studied by Lawrence Gowing, to linger briefly once more over this anxiety about distance, which I wish to connect to another remark to Bernard, speaking "of planes which fall on top of one another," a problem which "neo-impressionism" tries to resolve by circumscribing "the contours with a black line, a fault which must be fought at all costs."7 Putting these "planes which fall on top of one another" in relation in turn with the collapse of horizontal surfaces into verticality that is so pronounced in many of Cezanne's paintings (for example the Courtauld's Plaster Cupid [circa 1895]), I can only agree with Rosalind Krauss's analysis in seeing this type of picture as marking the emergence, for the first time in the history of Western art since the Renaissance, of a hiatus-or rather the recognition of a hiatus-between the purely visual space of projection (on the vertical plane of the painting) and the tactile and carnal space in which our bodies participate. As Krauss has shown in relation to the paintings Picasso made in 1909 at Horta de Ebro, paintings which she connects directly to the C zanne of the Plaster Cupid, this disjunction between the vertical cut of the visual field and the lateral extension of tactility, where "depth is what occurs when the ground gives way below one's feet," results in a crisis, a doubt about vision's own capacity to give us access to depth.8 Kahnweiler reports this paradoxical remark by Picasso: "In a Raphael painting it is not possible to establish the distance from the tip of the nose to the mouth. I should like to paint pictures in which that would be possible."9 Of course, we need to recognize the irony in this remark, and 5. FrancisJourdain, Cizanne (1950), in Conversations, p. 84 n. 1. 6.

But Picasso's fundamental doubt about illusionistic depth and the idea according to which it is no longer possible in painting if, as Cezanne said, one owes the truth, seems to me to have the same source as that which leads Cezanne to fold the ground plane vertically over the elevation in the lower part of some of his paintings, as if, as the space between himself and the represented object narrowed, he were forced to lower his eyes to take in his feet. Let us return to the letter to Bernard with which I opened. The famous phrase about "the cylinder, the sphere, and the cone" has given rise, as we know, to many, many commentaries, most frequently wholly erroneous (we know how the "cube" has been added in an apocryphal manner to this formula and what use has been made of this new minting by those who have wanted to read Cubism as a geometrical exercise for which C6zanne was the precursor). We know today, thanks to Reff and Gowing, who have both paid more attention than have their predecessors to the remarks reported by Riviere and Schnerb, that the famous formula concerns more the general rotundity of volumes and surfaces such as they appear to perception than any geometrical stylization of bodies. (To recall: Riviere and Schnerb note that when Cezanne spoke of the spherical quality of bodies he was not only thinking of all those balls, apples or otherwise, that fill his paintings, like those ready to tumble down the slope of the Plaster Cupid, but also of perfectly planar surfaces, such as a wall; in this there would perhaps be an element to add to the file set up by Reff concerning the relations between Cezanne and Chardin, whose walls are always established as curving behind his still lifes, even if they are most often concave.) 10 Gowing has very carefully studied the implication of this principle of general sphericness on what C6zanne called his "modulation" of color. Here I would like to return to an aspect of this question that has not been sufficiently noticed, one that concerns the organic character of C6zanne's volumes, particularly in the landscape paintings and watercolors. The late views of the Bib6mus quarry and the rocks and grottos of the Chateau Noir are certainly the most spectacular from this point of view,11 but everywhere in differing degrees we can detect this tenden- cy to make every form into an organ (for example in the Rocks at L'Estaque of 1879-82). It has often been noted that the solids that Cezanne lists in his letter to Bernard have no arris (as he said to Riviere and Schnerb, "I am applying myself to 10.

I would thus rather tie this absence of arris to the idea not of a geometric body (and of visual projection), but to the idea of touch, of "contact," as Cezanne would say (and, if you want, of caress). We know that Cezanne was panicked by the idea of being touched, and I wonder if this phobia might not be directly symmetrical with what he wanted to realize in painting and thus also with the doubt about vision I evoked above. CUzanne wrote to Bernard that one must "penetrate what is before oneself," which can easily be taken in a banal manner as relating to the traditional optics from which perspective's visual projection issues.13 But if we relate this saying (with all the erotic connotations it implies) to the sense of touch, we change registers, and perhaps we approach more precisely what Cezanne wanted to attempt, namely, to splice vision and touch together at the very moment when the two sensory fields were in the process of splitting apart: in some way to invent a tactile vision. We know how constitutive the sense of touch was in Cezanne's practice (Richard Shiff has already insisted on this)14 and all that he owed to Courbet in this domain. But if we pass from the minimal unity of the stroke or "touch" to the ensemble of the painting, it seems to me that the debt to Courbet is no less great: the very anthropomorphicizing landscapes of the latter-for example, the famous series of the Source of the Loue (1863-64)-are marked by an impossible desire to penetrate into the body of the motif.15 Perhaps because of how much he learned from Pissarro, Cezanne knew-more than did Courbet-that this was impossible (and he would doubtless have considered literal anthropomorphism, such as Degas had mobilized it in certain of his landscapes, vulgar). But Brice Marden's quip treating the Montagne Saint-Victoire as a "giant tit" is not the simple schoolboy 12. R. P. Riviire and J. F.

Another important essay appeared shortly after the C6zanne symposium: T. J. Clark's "Freud's C6zanne," Representations 52 (Fall 1995), pp. 94-122. Although Clark is chiefly concerned with C6zanne's Barnes and Philadelphia Bathers, in which there is little "air" indeed (and which thus contradict what I am proposing here), he demonstrates as well the exceptional status of these works, noting the paucity and general embarrassment of the literature about them. But I view what he has to say in general about C6zanne's "materialism," about C6zanne's desire to "materialize the play of phantasy," and the connection he makes between this and the pre-psychoanalyic, positivist (but one could almost also say "atomist") Freud, as a direct confirmation of my own ruminations.</page><page sequence="8">38 OCTOBER :'::':pumps ...... .. .. .il~~dnm: ?i::i:: . ~pig s~)b~k~( ~ ~ ~ ~ ??I~~~:::: :::::Of . .. .. .. .. ~ ? a~IPIB~~[ . . . . . . . . . . .'iii . -i~cii~ IFIF' ... ... .. -OW %jaw: . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . .

I have already expressed my skepticism about Cezanne's use of a true aerial perspective and thus my doubt over the status he accorded to his 16.

However, I am far from admitting that there is no air in C6zanne's paintings. I would even go so far as to say that his works are themselves lungs, that they breathe. And if the C zannean stroke permits this respiration, this is above all because it is discrete, discontinuous, and because it presupposes a void-as in the classical physics of Lucretius, of which Cezanne was an avid reader. To say this telegraphically, C zanne's touch, by means of which he transcribed his "little sensation," his "coloring sensations," was the bridge between his pigment and the substances, forms, and spatiality of the world: it was an abstraction, prac- tically a musical form of notation, but it was what allowed him to conceive his paintings as worlds under construction, similar-in their mode of existence for our perception-to nature itself. As Merleau-Ponty has so well noted, to look at a C6zanne, particularly a late watercolor, is to see simultaneously its molecular surface and the depicted object in the act of germinating under our very eyes. However, we should make slightly clearer how this "germination" works. I mention watercolor here because this is where we can best grasp Cezanne's process: his late canvases-Gowing and many others have noted this-adopt a type of colored construction first explored in watercolor, but I would even say that the work of his "couillarde" period, above all his portraits and several still lifes, already seem to me a contradictory anticipation of this method that he couldn't yet envision (contradictory because the heavy facture of the "couillarde" period, although strictly atomic, could only prevent the transparency and fluidity essential to this very method). What then is this method? It is a matter of a molecular process which is not simply additive, but multiplying. His works are geologically constructed of layers, or rather of levels, of skeins of molecules more or less loose, each skein responding both to the one that precedes it and to the whiteness of the support. None of these levels entirely fuses with the others. Cezanne is very careful that his colors don't mix (we know he had a violent dislike of mixture and how his extremely var- ied palette astonished Bernard)18: the atoms must remain identifiable as such (the transparency of watercolor, its very rapid drying time, were perfect for this end). Superimpositions (where the atoms partially cover each other) engender various colored modulations but are always discernable as combinations of primary atoms. However, as I've said, this process wasn't additive; despite the temptation that one might have to retrace the artist's elaboration step by step, this is always in vain: C zanne's works cancel the linearity of time; they breathe. I will allow myself here to quote a commentary at length, particularly because it has been a bit forgotten. It's from a text by Max Raphael, posthumously published in 1968, the pretext for which was above all the Sainte-Victoire Seen from Les Lauves (1902-4) in the Philadelphia Museum of Art: 18. Emile Bernard, "Souvenirs sur Paul Cezanne" (1907), in Conversations, p. 61 n. 1.</page><page sequence="10">40 OCTOBER Let us consider the nearest plane: a dark area made up of various violets and greens. One color (violet) is decomposed into a warm (reddish) tone and a cold (bluish) tone; the first comes forward, the second recedes. This creates a tension which sets these tones apart yet relates them to each other, so that they seem to belong to distinct layers although there is no perceptible space between them. The number of layers employing the same color varies, but whether the contrast involves two or more layers, our actual perception is one not of movement but of tension. In consequence, perception of time is eliminated from our per- ception of three-dimensionality; or, to be more exact, we do not perceive time as elapsing while we become aware of a multiplicity of layers.19 This passage is complex but it seems to me that in it Raphael gets to some- thing that is unique to C6zanne, at least before Pollock, something that specifically fascinated Marden, namely, this abolition of perceptual time, corresponding to an infinite copenetration of levels that nevertheless remain discrete. Here's what Marden said of Pollock, but he could just as well be speaking of C6zanne, since for a long time Marden has read the one in terms of the other: You look at the colors and the marks, and you try to redraw them. You look at the blacks and you follow the way they went on the canvas, then you follow the whites, say, then the browns.... But there's always some point where you lose the trail; you just can't read it because it never reads as layering. It's nice to think, well, he did the black all at the same time and we can follow those marks, but when you really start looking at the painting, there are places where the black is over the white, and then there are places where the white is over the black. I don't really know how he was working those colors, how he could go back and forth between colors and layers. The colors may look layered, but I think there was a more organic flow between what looks like the bottom layer and what looks like the top layer.... and all those marks and colors become the real space of the painting.20 This is also perhaps-and here I am referring to a hobbyhorse of my own- what relates not only Pollock and Cezanne but both of them to the interlacing Mondrian effected in his last pictures, weavings that put a space into play that is not purely visual and thus illusionistic but tactile as well. After this excursion into twentieth-century art, I would like to raise a last 19. Max Raphael, "The World of Art and the Model in Nature," The Demands of Art (London: 1968), pp. 21-22. 20.

This state of "unfinish" is of course not that, and the many com- mentators on this-from Riviere and Schnerb to Renoir and Matisse-have noted that every canvas, every watercolor by Cezanne, whatever the moment in the process at which it has been "interrupted," is always structured as a totality. It is what, speaking elsewhere of Matisse's debt to Cezanne, I have called "the economy of the session": Cezanne stops when the ensemble holds and each session, even if it takes up a picture in process and already reworked a hundred times, is an absolute recommencement.21 Whence the famous remark made to Vollard about the two tiny points of empty canvas, or reserve, in his portrait: "If I put something here by guesswork, I might have to paint the whole canvas over, starting from that point."22 The whites of Cezanne are thus not open sores but the unavoidable consequence of his way of working: they are void spaces that are as constructive as the filled-in ones; at least that's the way Matisse read them. 21.

Vollard, Paul Cizanne (1914), in Cizanne in Perspective, p. 64.</page><page sequence="12">42 OCTOBER However, Cezanne seems to have complained of these reserve zones (he put them down to his age and as "abstractions" that are engendered in him by the "coloring sensations, which give the light").23 And in the light of his most worked- over canvases-the lumpy portraits from the end, for example those of Vallier or the Pushkin Museum's Sainte-Victoire-and taking account of what he said to Riviere and Schnerb in front of the Barnes Foundation Great Bathers as well, namely, that he wanted "to paint with a loaded brush, like Courbet,"24 we might wonder if the destiny of all of Cezanne's works, even those whose aerated respiration we acclaim, was not to end by being dark and saturated with matter, as had been the works of the "couillarde" period. The contradiction on this point between Cezanne's declared intentions and the omnipresence of the whites in his painting has been the focus of numerous commentaries, but even so I would like to return to the matter of the reserve. I want to bring to bear on this the well-known remarks about the unity of color and drawing: "Drawing and color are not separate at all; in so far as you paint, you draw."25 Rather than wanting to read them, as has been rightly done, as signs of a simple refusal of linearism on Cezanne's part (and thus in terms of the line/color alternative as that has been debated in France since the seventeenth century), I would here like to fold these remarks into the generic issue of the relations between painting and drawing. Contrary to what the history of art makes us think, connoisseurs have never judged paintings and drawings according to the same criteria and have always been conscious of the fact that they don't belong to the same historical time: from Pontormo to Poussin, from Guercino to Tiepolo, the art of drawing evolved in a framework of conventions very different from that of painting (many things permitted in drawing would never have been accepted in painting). Now, the major difference between the space of drawing and that of painting concerns the nature of the support. Since the time of Alberti, the picture plane is assumed as transparent in painting, but the condition sine qua non of this transparency is that the supporting ground be covered over without reserve. Conversely, as Walter Benjamin has remarked, "the graphic line can exist only against this background, so that a drawing that completely covered its background would cease to be a draw- ing."26 Benjamin made this remark after having seen a show of Picasso's Cubist paintings, precisely because they seemed to him to put this simple opposition into question: he would very well have been as troubled by a Cezanne exhibition, without doubt the first painter to have abolished this constitutive difference. And maybe it's just for that, for having canceled the difference between 23. Cezanne to Emile Bernard, October 23, 1905, in Letters, p. 316 (translation modified). 24.

It remains to be seen if such was his intention. I personally believe that he was obliged to do this: if, as Merleau-Ponty has stated, Cezanne's goal was to paint perception itself, and if, as he himself put it, he wanted "to see as a newborn,"27 that is to say, at the very moment of an originary discrimination, he would have had to activate the opposition between figure and ground that is at the foundation of our human perception; and the ascent of the support-namely, the contamina- tion of the pictorial field by the graphic one-was the best route to take, or perhaps, even, the only one. 27.
