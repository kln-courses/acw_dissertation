<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Grace of the Daily The Poetics of the Everyday: Creative Repetition in Modern American Verse by Siobhan Phillips Columbia University Press, 2010. 319 pages Jeff Westover Readers of Siobhan Phillips's Poetics of the Everyday will find her insights about the ordinary opportunities of daily life in the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, and James Merrill widely in structive. Here's the primary research question this book poses: "can it matter so much . . . how or even if one gets up in the morning? The poetics of everyday time resists such indifference by presenting ordinary life as significant drama" (2). Pursuing this question, Phillips uncovers a wide-ranging cultural fact about twentieth-century poetry: its artful and sometimes reverential concern with the quotidian frequently served as a way to maneuver the mundane into a means of spiritual survival, if not always thriving sustenance. Like Liesl Olson in Ordinary Modernism, Phil lips awakens readers to the centrality of ordinary living in the work of important twentieth-century poetry. Whereas Olson draws on the concepts of Henri Lefebvre to situate the work of Stein, Joyce, Proust, and Stevens in various social, historical and personal contexts, however, Phillips prefers to use Kierkegaard and American pragmatism to make her case for everyday poetics. Phillips's centers of value are experiential, aesthetic, and spiritual rather than politi cal, and her argument seeks to give due weight to the individual concerns and artistic challenges faced by her four representative poets. Overall, she aims for a much-needed synthesis of or rapprochement between cultural studies approaches that focus on social contexts and the resurgent critical emphasis on form. In order to achieve this synthesis, Phillips focuses on the ways each poet "converts the necessity of quotidian experience into an aesthetic and experiential opportunity" (1) in their handling of verse. She locates her study in American traditions of romanticism and pragmatism, showing how her writers resist earlier preoccupations with "transcendent selfhood" in favor of poetic strategies that display how "common life can be newly Twentieth-Century Literature 58.3 Fall 2012 532</page><page sequence="2">Review critical" and relevant to the inner imperatives of daily living (3). Her study reflects the impact of existentialist philosophy and the pragmatism of Emerson and William James as well as Stanley Cavell's ordinary-language philosophy. While she focuses on her representative poets, her study also suggests that everyday-life theory can be relevant for understanding such diverse authors as Robert Lowell, A. R. Ammons, Robert Creeley, James Schuyler, Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Robert Hass, Kay Ryan, and Frank Bidart. Given her concerns, Phillips's study seems more at home with the is sues addressed by analysts of the relationship between poetry and pragma tism like Richard Poirier, Elisa New, Jonathan Levin, and Angus Fletcher than with the historical context of Roy Harvey Pearce's The Continuity of American Poetry, the economic preoccupations of Frank Lentricchia's Modernist Quartet, or the cultural concerns of Liesl Olson or Nick Halp ern. Phillips draws on Vernon Shetley's triangulation of anti-subjectivity in Language poetry, uncritical subjectivity in "MFA mainstream" lyric poetry, and "New formalist faith in the power of traditional poetic forms to give valid shapes to subjectivity" (After the Death of Poetry [19-20]) in order to situate her claim that a critical emphasis on "ordinary repetition" and everyday time can help overcome the limitations of each of these three camps and thus enable us to better evaluate poetry as an overall cultural form (Phillips 210). "To accept the debilitations of the daily," Phillips argues, "is also to claim its regular, even ceremonial renewal" (4). In the work of her four representative poets, she contends, "Daily practice can maintain effective subjective freedom within an objective necessity." As this suggests, Phillips's approach aims to address the divide between contemporary Language poetry and the lyric's traditional emphasis on personal feeling: "Frost's self-fashioning, Stevens's dreamwork, Bishop's reparations, and Merrill's self-analyses all rely on and transform a quotid ian context. For these writers, to neglect one's daily existence is to cede one's individual self" (15).This concern with selfhood certainly remains a central one in American culture, a preoccupation whose continuity with older traditions of lyric Phillips's choice of poets aptly underscores. Diurnal recurrence also provides an important aesthetic pattern for the poetry on which Phillips focuses. All of her poets have been judged to be major, but none of them are devotees of "free verse spontaneity" (8). This fact challenges a mainstream storyline for twentieth-century Ameri can poetry that takes Pound's "to break the pentameter, that was the first 533</page><page sequence="3">Jeff Westover heave" as its keynote. By foregrounding the ordinary, Phillips demonstrates how Frost, Stevens, Bishop, and Merrill "link the composition of one's daily existence to the composition of ones poetic lines" (6). To situate her argument and indicate its larger ambitions, Phillips claims that "a focus on timeliness takes up an aspect of daily life that is at once transcultural, less various than the quotidian's many possible con tents, and tangible, less vague than the quotidian's many possible mean ings" (7). She aims to demonstrate that "a particular temporality enables a self-fashioning that may well be an enduring interest of ordinary exis tence" (7), grounding the transcultural and universalizing dimension of her argument in her view that "the iterations of daily life, in these writers' verse, provide recurrent chances for agency as well as recurrent assurances of its relation or effects" (4-5). One of her book's overall goals, then, is to overcome a false dichotomy that pits poetry against politics. On this basis, she identifies three concerns as foremost for her poets: 1. memory and mourning 2. guilt and atonement 3. submission and assertion (8) Together these issues constitute the religious or at least spiritual sensibil ity with which Phillips approaches her poets. Of course this sensibility reflects another historic dimension of American culture, one with which the field of American studies is familiar but which contemporary theory tends to marginalize or eschew. In counterpoise to what she calls the free-verse anti-self line in American poetics stemming from William Carlos Williams and Charles Olson, Phillips argues, Frost, Bishop, and Merrill in their " everyday work . . . strive to keep . . . individuality intact—and strive to do so through the recurrence that Olson banishes. Their daily repetitions show that a subjectivist objectivist dichotomy might be a needlessly stark reaction to modernist problems" (9). In arguing this point, however, Phillips inad vertently demonstrates the difficulty of the sorts of universalist claims she makes for the everyday. She emphasizes, for instance, the way that mar riage (for Frost), and also to some extent gay partnerships (for Bishop and Merrill), provide her poets with a setting for such valorized dailiness. As a norm and a means of securing happiness, marriage is hailed by these poets (and to some degree by Phillips) as a general good. For readers on the outside of this discourse, of course, such ideas can prove either charming 534</page><page sequence="4">Review and seductive or distancing. On the other hand, it's probably still mostly true that every day is a choice, whether you are married or not. And the choice entails possibilities and responsibilities. That every day is a choice is presumably true even for some prisoners, though the victims of torture no doubt feel less free and in command of how to live out their days. And a billion people live on a dollar a day, making many of them prey to the contemporary slave trade (Skinner): what is "ordinary" for them? Is it comparable to the average day of those who enjoy higher standards of living? That said, ordinariness may be as wide-ranging a factor as one is likely to get, as near a common lot as exists, and Phillips's poets do lay a general claim to this average mode of living, at least for many Americans. As Phil lips takes care to point out, "To be fully ordinary, for these poets, is also to be both authentic and exceptional" (20). In the careers of these four poets, the ordinary becomes an accomplishment, an artistic and spiritual attainment, a feat presumably just as possible for poets of less interest to Phillips. It is worth noticing that general readers of poetry (at least judg ing from personal teaching experience) often value these aspects in what they read more than most scholars and perhaps some poets tend to do. Phillips's approach has the advantage of being relevant for such readers, and the fact that her sentences are marked by a pleasing poise and artful ness increase her book's attractiveness. Phillips's study also has the virtue of indentifying a vein that may be productively worked in the future, even for poets she does not cover—raising the question, for instance, of how the specific qualities of other poets (such as nonwhite ones or those practicing free verse) might be better understood or appreciated in light of an "everyday poetics." Phillips substantiates her claims about ordinary experience and ex traordinary selfhood in different ways for each of her poets. In the case of Frost, she zeroes in on the "middle way" he adopts between his persona as an ordinary man and images of him as "a reactionary exception to modern or American literary history" (32). For Phillips, Frost's "work shows how a seeming self-compromise can be a subtle self-assertion" (34). Emphasizing Frost's admiration for Emerson and Jamesian pragmatism, she follows Mark Richardson's claim that "a worldly context creates rather than opposes Frost's individualism" (33). Although she addresses some of Frost's major work, she focuses more on less-studied poems to reveal how "Frost links worldly and human rounds to make ordinary experience the 535</page><page sequence="5">Jeff Westover test and proof of consciousness" (33). She focuses in particular on Frost's treatment of conversation in his poetry and on "Frostian mornings, in which one must rise both independently 'unaided' and dependently 'with' the world's progress." Phillips devotes a lot of pages to "In the Home Stretch," which she compares with the domestic and marital settings of "The Hill Wife," "Ser vant to Servants," and "Home Burial." "Home Stretch" exemplifies the way in which Frost turns to "married life" to "make the familiar novel" (55). Although the poem "merely tells of a husband and wife's first night in a new home," Phillips shows how it also meditates on crucial existential concerns (34-35). In the world of this poem, "the daily washing of dishes or the nightly lighting of fires" allows the householder to "both accom modate and appropriate a natural world—and thereby feel 'at home' in a familiar strangeness" (35). The poem thus pits a linear, narrative time ("steps") against a recursive lyric motion ("circles") to demonstrate how ordinary experience provides a good arena for the individual will to prove itself. In "The Faithful Mode ofWallace Stevens," Phillips shows how Ste vens overcame the conflict between "the malady of the quotidian" ("The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad") and a longing for transcendence by learning (in the wake of "The Comedian as the Letter C") to value the commonplace in and for itself. In particular, she focuses on the optative aspect of Stevens's poetry. "Like Frost's willed comparisons," she writes, Stevens's wishful conceptions recognize the temporal axis of post-Enlightenment poetics. Every mental creation, he persis tently suggests, inscribes a space between present and future, what is and what could be. Stevens's imagination, as he writes in "Description without Place," consists of a conflated "expecta tion" and "desire"... .Stevens would therefore preserve the gap between present and future just as much as Frost would preserve the space between present and past... .Deferral extends poetic opportunity as it extends life. (81) This process-oriented approach is of course a hallmark of Stevens's poet ics, and Phillips traces its trajectories by focusing on his profound com mitment to diurnal time, especially in "An Ordinary Evening in New Haven," but also through considerations of "Notes toward a Supreme Fiction," "Credences of Summer," "The Man with the Blue Guitar,""The 536</page><page sequence="6">Review Auroras of Autumn," and the lovely late poem "The World as Meditation." By doing so, she accounts for Stevens's capacity to turn humdrum routine into harmonious songs of "fixed accord" (80). For Stevens, she explains, "desire for reality can manifest one's conscious and creative difference from the actual world" (81). In her chapter on Bishop, Phillips dwells on the poet's "everyday elegies," a term by which she indicates that Bishop's poems function as ordinary memorials to lost pasts. As with Frost and Stevens, this mode of remembering is active and resourceful, and it sustains her work as a poet: "Bishop's revisionary life and art would not only preserve her past and continue her present but also set her existence in some meaningful rela tion with a natural order" (115). Noting the intensity with which the past haunts the present in many of her poems, Phillips emphasizes how Bishop turns personal guilt to good poetic ends throughout her career. Some of her works take on the task of acknowledging or confronting the painful burden of her mother's institutionalization for madness and repairing or managing the anxiety and depression this situation provoked. Scenes of dawning ("Roosters," "Anaphora," "Five Flights Up," "The Prodigal") and spring ("A Cold Spring"), meanwhile, provide the ceremonial revela tion of new opportunities, a potential that Bishop grounds in the natural rhythms of diurnal and seasonal change. While poems like "The Man Moth" and "Over 2,000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance" show Bishop's awareness that the burden of human consciousness is inescapable, and the assumption of an animal innocence only a fantasy, she achieves a measure of serenity by ordering her experience through the patterns of verse and the ritual repetitions of days and seasons. Phillips's discussion of "Sestina" underlines this poetic synthesis of personal experience and nature: in the poem, "The almanac tells when it is' time to plant tears,' and it will tell when to harvest their meanings. One can trust one's living to a supraindividual rubric without erasing the distinction of an individual history" (139). This objective subjectivity is a major concern of Phillips's whole book. James Merrill, finally, aims to characterize time "as less like a cyclic degeneration and more like a spiral of ever 'truer' tomorrows (1), an argument Phillips mounts by connecting the symbol of sand in an early lyric, "Hourglass," with the title of Merrill's trilogy, The Changing Light at Sandover. She also draws attention to the centrality of love in Mer rill's work, thereby echoing her analyses of marriage in Frost's poetry and Bishop's partnership with Lota de Macedo Soares: "With Frost," she 537</page><page sequence="7">Jeff Westover writes, Merrill "compares the recurrences of time with the recurrences of companionship; with Frost, too, he suggests that the promise of such time depends on the health of such partnership" (157). Her overall claim in this chapter is that "Merrill's work would resist egotism as well as aestheti cism by an ironic estrangement that can discover depths in what seems everyday or superficial" (165). While Phillips notes that Sandover mixes the daily routine of a couple with apocalyptic ruminations, her attention to Merrill's revision of symbols in "Self-Portrait in Tyvek*™* Windbreaker" is more moving. She does a good job of showing how Merrill's awe for Roberto Murolo's folk songs (which unite ordinary human concerns with natural rhythms) allows him to recognize a more authentic meaning in the design on his jacket than he initially sees. In Merrill's poem, Murolo's songs transfigure "a regressive wish for a forgiving, healthy planet into a self-conscious re-creation of a forbearing, developing world" (195). For Phillips, the benefit of focusing on poetry's experimentation with recurrence—what she calls "versified time"—is that it "can de scribe an agency" that is both "situated" and "transcultural" (24). Phillips defines "poetic agency" as "a singular creativity working through the common, definite—but undated—stipulations of its setting." Through her framework, she means to reconcile the opposing characterizations of poetry by Virginia Jackson (situated, generically various) and Susan Stewart ("transcultural" and "anthropomorphic"). "An everyday poetics," she writes, "shows that when poets treat some common formal problem of lyric, they also help to describe some common temporal problems of living."With its focus on rhythms and patterns, verse can uniquely show "how the ticks of an individual time span relate to the rounds of a com mon time" (24-25). But while Phillips's emphasis on the everyday clearly aims to over come critical impasses in the study of twentieth-century and contem porary poetry, it's probably true that a greater focus on the conditions faced by a more diverse range of poets would better support her claims for commonality. Maybe the problem is also related to Phillips's termi nology—"temporality" is a key word in her argument, but her use of it tends to scant the historical and political dimensions of the concept. (One admires Phillips's cagey use of "timeliness" for its double meanings of "the concept of time" and "the state of being opportune, relevant," but her book could do more to tease out and justify the latter meaning, which is, after all, the more primary one in current usage—and the one that could bring relevant aspects of the historic and social more squarely 538</page><page sequence="8">Review within her compass). In other words, Phillips's case studies may be insuf ficiently representative, at least to justify her larger claims for the every day's contribution to modernist studies and American literary studies more generally. For example, she states in her epilogue that "there exists a historicity that is not necessarily historical" (200), but one can imagine (and wish for) worthwhile studies that will challenge this claim with the same philosophical rigor, formal sensitivity, and interpretive richness one finds throughout The Poetics of the Everyday. Yet on their own terms Phillips's readings richly repay attention. Moreover, her focus on factors that connect rather than divide fields of study is certainly welcome. Somewhere between the deadening pessi mism ofWilliam Blake's "same dull round over again" and the ebullient enthusiasm of e. e. cummings's "i thank you god for most this amazing / day," Phillips's four champions stride forth to claim the dramatic middle ground of the quotidian for poetry.
