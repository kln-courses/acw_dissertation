ABSTRACT The present study was conducted to compare a new air bag folding pattern, the so-called Petri folding (P-folding) with the conventional folding scheme, the so-called Leporello folding (L-folding) under out-of- position conditions. Static out-of-position tests were carried through with driverside air bag modules mounted to a rigid test stand and folded either according to the PF- or the LF-scheme. A Hybrid III small female dummy was placed on a seat in front of the module with two main test configurations: "chest centered on module" and "forehead centered on module" with varying separations from the module ranging from 0 to 100 mm. For the configuration "chest centered on module" values of all relevant injury criteria for the chest and the neck were significantly lower with the P-folding. For the configuration "forehead centered on module" neck loadings were lower with P-folding in almost all cases except for neck tension and extension moment at separations of 0 mm and 20 mm. The geometry of the module cover tear line was found to have negative influence here. The use of a neckskin and chin insert in some of the tests had different effects on the neck loads depending on the bag folding pattern. Cosmetic markings applied to the dummy's face left far less smeared remains on the P-folded bag in comparison to the conventional folding. This indicates a reduced relative motion between the bag fabric and the skin during inflation. INTRODUCTION With increasingly more vehicles now being equipped with air bag systems, the out-of-position problem complex has accordingly attracted growing interest. "Out-of-position" (OOP) denotes a situation in which the vehicle occupant is located unusually close to the air bag module at the time of inflation. As a result, the occupant comes into contact with the air bag during its deployment or, in extreme cases, with the door of the module cover as well. Adverse positioning of the occupant in front of the air bag module at the time of its actuation can be the result of various causes, e.g., delayed triggering of the air bag during the crash-related forward-displacement phase of an unrestrained occupant, a seating position too close to the steering wheel especially for small drivers, ora slumped occupant [1, 2, 3], The SAE Information Report No. J 1980 contains proposals for the conduct of systematic out-of-position tests on air bag modules, air bag - steering systems, and vehicle interiors equipped with air bag systems by utilizing anthropomorphic test devices [1], Out-of- position studies conducted in the past have mainly concentrated on static tests for reasons of higher repeatabilty of test conditions and focusing on few parameters. The small female from the family of Hybrid 111 dummies was considered to be the dummy most susceptible to high biomechanical loads under OOP conditions, especially to the neck [4], Loading mechanisms during the contact phase under out-of-position conditions have been broken down by Horsch et al. into "punchout" and "membrane loading" phenomena [2], Punchout occurs in an early phase of inflation, when only a small portion of the bag has escaped from the module. Membrane loading denotes the phase when the fabric wraps around a body region as the bag becomes full, thereby exerting a relatively distributed force on the occupant. A third mechanism related with inflation induced injuries, the so-called "bag-slap" [5, 6] occurs when the occupant is struck by a small but rapidly moving portion of the bag. Even if this effect does not result in critical injuries it can cause skin abrasions or eye injuries. Until now, efforts to reduce biomechanical loads under OOP conditions have centered on design and 2890</page><page sequence="2">conceptual measures for the inflator [3] and the module cover [2], The study described in the following, however, is concentrated on the influence of air bag folding on the loads applied to drivers. A new, pleat-type of folding for the air bag has been developed at the Petri company based on production-engineering advantages in the manufacture of air bag modules. Originally known as "Petri-folding" or "pleat folding" it will be designated in the following as "P-folding" or "PF-bag". Since inflation tests with pleat-folded bags also demonstrated an unfolding behavior superior to conventionally folded air bags a series of comparative OOP static tests was conducted to determine differences in loads on drivers under various configurations of the dummy and the air bag module. The purpose of this testing was therefore to establish whether special air bag folding could offer an effective means for reducing the injury risk. Conventional folding schemes for air bags - especially those on the driver side - are variations of the so-called Leporello-folding. With the Leporello technique, named L-folding or LF-pattern in the following, the air bag is folded in accordion-type layers to a package which is generally located directly above the inflator (Fig. 1). In order that the inflating gas can flow into the layers of fabric upon air bag deployment, almost the entire bag package must first be ejected from the module. Deployment, however, is strongly impeded by the folded edges and the layers of fabric lying on top of each other. When the individual layers unfold, the predetermined direction of motion brings about the characteristic whip-like effects which can cause bag-slap injuries. With the P-folding scheme, on the other hand, the air bag is configured in the form of several concentric ring folds around the inflator (Fig. 1). As a result, only one layer of air bag fabric is situated directly over the inflator. When the bag begins to deploy, it is pulled out of the module, ring fold by ring fold, beginning with the center portion over the inflator. Because the fold layers in this solution do not interfere with each other during deployment, the unfolding of the entire air bag takes place faster. Contrary to the LF-scheme, the PF-bag deployment immediately proceeds in a radial direction. Comparative deployment tests have shown that the air bag in this new solution - although it is discharged from the module faster than bags with conventional folding - does not travel so far toward the occupant during the initial deployment phase, and that it sooner assumes its final form for energy absorption. Adomeit has described this folding scheme in detail, and has explained its effects on air bag inflation [7], Fig. 1: Air bag folding patterns used for comparison TEST SETUP TEST ENVIRONMENT - The test setup was especially designed for static OOP tests (Fig.2). It consists of two main components: a seat for accommodation of the dummy and a test rig to support the steering wheel and the driver-side air bag module. The test seat is a standard-model driver's seat with a head restraint. The seatback is supported at its rear in order to prevent its plastic deformation from rearward impact of the dummy. The test mock-up allows the steering wheel and the air bag module to be adjusted horizontally and vertically as well as in their angular position around the lateral axis. The entire test rig has been designed with sufficient structural stiffness to absorb the reaction forces during air bag deployment without energy absorption by the module mounting. The steering wheel, made of steel tubing, is a rigid simulation of a four-spoke wheel which, together with the tested air bag modules, is in current standard- production. The tests have accordingly been conducted under worst-case conditions for energy absorption; additional parameters resulting from the steering wheel are eliminated. The driver-side module itself is connected to its mounting plate via an additional aluminum mounting plate and three load cells which measure compression and tension forces in the axial direction. Exchange of test parts between the individual tests is restricted to the air bag module alone. 2891</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2: Static out-of-position test setup In addition to recording the reaction forces of the air bag module onto the mounting plate the interior pressure in the module is measured by a differential- pressure sensor. DUMMY - A "Small Female Hybrid III" dummy with standard instrumentation served as anthropomorphic test device. The dummy featured a thorax potentiometer, as well as tri-axial accelerometers mounted in the head, spine-box and pelvis. Femur forces were not measured owing to the negligible values expected there. A tri-axial upper neck load cell was installed between the upper neck element and the head to record the shear forces Fx, axial forces Fz, and the bending moment My. Earlier studies had demonstrated the necessity of ensuring enhanced biofidelity in OOP tests by rendering the neck and chin geometry of the Hybrid III dummy more humanoid through provision of a neckskin and a chin insert [2,4]. Since a neckskin is not commercially available for the small female, this component was especially prepared. Melvin et al. describe neckskin and chin insert of this type [4], Because the foam materials indicated in this paper were not available in Germany - at least not under the brand name given - it was necessary for these tests to switch over to materials with similar properties. The neckskin used consisted of two layers of soft foam, each 6 mm thick, with the specification "Polyethylene DY". These layers were arranged around the neck of the dummy and were secured against slipping by applying adhesive tape (Fig. 3). The chin insert was prepared from rigid foam with the specification "DOW Ethafoam 400 E" and was covered with adhesive tape to reduce the friction against the air bag fabric. Care was taken not to alter the force-deformation behavior of the Hybrid III neck and head by these measures. It was consequently necessary to accept slight deviations from the form and hardness of the human neck. In order to eliminate the possibility of secondary force paths through the neckskin, it does not enclose the rear side of the neck at which no contact with the air bag is expected. There was a sufficient gap between the chin insert and the neck in order not to interfere with flexion movements between head and neck. Targets were attached to the head, the upper neck element and the spine box to determine angular motion between head, neck and thorax from the high- speed film. Fig. 3: Neckskin and targets used with Hybrid III small female dummy AIR BAG MODULE - All tests were conducted with a driverside air bag module with an uncoated 64-liter bag. The test air bags were folded either according to the conventional LF-scheme or by the PF-technique. The module cover was provided as a dual- component plastic cover. The module door of this cover initially breaks open at the top owing to the design of the cover tear line and then flips downward when the air bag deploys (Fig. 4). The inflator type is a commonly used component among European car manufacturers. To enable measurement of the interior pressure in the module, the inside of one of the four inflator mounting bolts was drilled out to gain access to the module interior. As a result, this measuring point is located adjacent to one of the gas outlets of the inflator. 2892</page><page sequence="4">module cover j^ver-side steering wheel Fig. 4: Cover tear line of driver-side modules used in tests METHODOLOGY In order to allow effective study of the fundamental effects and variances in the deployment of air bags with these two different packing schemes, as well as analysis of their interaction with vehicle occupants under OOP conditions, the decision was made to conduct static tests. By restricting the setup to the above described test rig the number of influencing factors is reduced to few parameters. While the rigidity of the steering wheel simulation and module mount suggests harder conditions in terms of energy absorption, the static test setup lacks the influence of vehicle deceleration present in a dynamic test environment. Though deviating dummy loadings and kinematics could be expected from this, similar thoracic loads were measured in sled tests and static tests in a comparative study by Horsch et al. [2], Since the mock-ups were designed differently in that case, the rigidity of the static test rig supposedly produced comparable loads on the dummy as the dynamic effects in sled testing. Earlier studies made by Horsch et al. and Melvin et al. used static test setups with a vertically configured air bag and steering wheel axis over which the dummy lay or kneeled [2, 4], In the work described here, these earlier setups were replaced by a dummy sitting upright in front of a horizontal or slightly inclined air bag module. With this configuration the initial load of 1 G due to earth gravity is eliminated. In addition, it was expected that exact positioning of the dummy in front of the module would be simpler with this setup, even without additional devices. Two of the configurations proposed in SAE Information Report No. J 1980 [1] were selected for the present series of tests with modification of details as follows (Fig. 5): • Centric orientation of the dummy chest to the module, with variation of the separation (i.e., 100 mm, 50 mm, 20 mm, 0 mm) • Centric orientation of the dummy forehead to the module, with variation of the separation (i.e., 100 mm, 50 mm, 20 mm, 0 mm) Fig. 5: Main test configurations: "chest centered on module" (above) and "forehead centered on module" (below) This arrangement was intended to allow not only the extreme positioning with distances of 0 mm - sometimes denoted as "against-position" investigated in most of the earlier studies [2,4], but also configurations which featured small distances from the module. On the basis of the fact that during a collision any vehicle occupant who has contact with the not yet actuated air bag module will of necessity have progressed through all the distances of 100, 50, and 20 mm, it may confidently be assumed that such positions at the moment of air bag triggering are statistically at least as frequent as direct contact with the module. 2893</page><page sequence="5">The small female was selected for the tests in view of results gained from the study of Melvin et al. [4]. Their comparative OOP tests indicated that the small female is subjected in most configurations to higher biomechanical loading - especially to the neck - than the mid-size male on the basis of the scaled Injury Assessment Reference Value (IARV). The lARVs given in [8] and used in that study were applied for tests here with the small female. These values are listed in the tables. Still, one should consider that lARVs were evaluated for frontal crash testing with Hybrid III adult dummies and refer to specified significant injuries. Applying these lARVs to biomechanical loads recorded in out-of-position tests does not necessarily mean that thereby injury mechanisms under these different loading conditions are assessed correctly and that all relevant inflation induced injuries are seized. Horsch et al. have discussed the biofidelity of the Hybrid III thorax and neck in OOP testing [2], They judged the chest to be an appropriate device for air bag punch-out loading centered on the sternum but pointed out the deficiencies in human-like neck geometry and lack of lARVs for neck loading with combined force components. Work on all test setups was conducted so as to compare results gained from conventional L-folding with those obtained from P-folding. In order to reduce the effects of random parameter deviations on the results and to enable assessment of the repeatability of the results, each test was conducted twice (with the exception of the configuration "chest centered on the module", distance of 100 mm, with P-folding). Additionally, for two distances selected from each of the main groups "chest centered on module" and "forehead centered on module", the tests were repeated with application of the neckskin and the chin insert. The objective here was to determine the influence of this measure on the loads applied to the dummy neck. CONDUCT OF TESTING The axis of the steering wheel and the air bag module was set horizontally for the tests in which the chest was centered on the module. The axis passing between the third and fourth rib of the dummy's rib cage was aligned with the center of the module. For orientation of the head centered on the module, the steering wheel was inclined by 20 degrees to allow the forehead to be laid against the module. The axis passing 25 mm above the e.g. of the head was aligned with the center of the module. The dummy was positioned on the seat with the height of the H-point maintained constant for all tests. For the configuration "forehead centered on the module", a constant position of the H-point in the longitudinal direction was likewise maintained. In order to stabilize the position of the dummy on the soft seat cushions and to simplify fine adjustment of the H- point, a slab of hard foam was inserted between the buttocks of the dummy and the seating surface. In addition to the position of the H-point, the angular positions of the dummy thighs, pelvis and thorax - as well as further control dimensions - were also recorded for each test. In order to ensure the correct position of the dummy in front of the module, it was in some cases necessary to secure the dummy at its shoulders by attaching easily-tearing adhesive paper tape to the steering-wheel rim. In order to achieve as small a dummy-module separation as possible for the configuration "chest centered on the module" it was necessary in these tests to tie down the breasts of the small female with adhesive tape (Fig. 2). Colored cosmetic material was applied to the chin, nose, forehead and thorax of the dummy in order to mark the points of dummy contact with the air bag during inflation. Documentation of the tests took place from the left with a high-speed film camera (1,000 frames/s) and high-speed video (4,500 images/s), and diagonally from the right rear by a high-speed film camera (1,000 frames/s). TEST RESULTS The tables provide details on the measured biomechanical loads as well as on the module reaction forces and interior pressures. For evaluation of occupant loading the scaled lARVs for the small female Hybrid III given in [8] and [4] were applied. Calculation of the Viscous Criterion (VC) took place in accordance with the scaling formula presented by Mertz [9]. "CHEST CENTERED ON MODULE" Chest loading - The graph for sternum deflection for both of the air bag folding schemes demonstrates an immediate rise which appears as an initial humpback rise on the plotted curve. This hump is also responsible for the level of the VC value. Following this sternum deflection - which must be attributed to a punchout effect - a slight decline takes place and is succeeded by a second hump resulting from the membrane loading phase. At a separation of 100 mm, sternum deflection in the membrane loading phase is greater for both bag folding schemes than that resulting from the punchout effect. In tests with smaller separation, however, beginning at 20 mm, the punchout effect dominates and leads to a rise in values for sternum deflection. Although there is no difference between the two types of folding in the qualitative appearance of the graphs for sternum deflection and VC, differences indeed become apparent for the peak values.

Whereas sternum deflection values at a maximum of 38 mm remain under the IARV of 53 mm for air bag contact [8] for both folding patterns, test values obtained with L-folding exceed the VC criterion in all tests with separations of 20 and 0 mm. With P-folding, tests for 0 mm, and barely for two of the tests at 20 mm, the results exceeded the VC limits (i.e., 1.01 and 1.10 m/s as opposed to the recommended VC threshold of 1.00 m/s). P-folding resulted in appreciable improvement of VC values for separations of 50 mm and greater. Test graphs show that P-folding - although it is associated with earlier beginning of sternum deflection - demonstrates not only lower peak values for sternum deflection, but also a lower compression rate. The combination of these two benefits leads to considerably reduced VC values. The thorax acceleration - as expressed by the 3-ms peak value - possesses little eloquence as injury criterion under the present test conditions [10] because soft tissue injury can be expected to be the dominating injury type for this body region. These values, however, remain far under the scaled IARV of 73 G for the small female for both folding schemes. The recorded pelvis accelerations were negligibly small. Neck loading - The shear forces Fx between head and upper neck remain at a safe separation below the IARV of 2.07 kN in all tests with the configuration "chest centered on the module". P-folded air bags provided results which were 40 ... 88% lower than the peak levels obtained by L-folding. While only posterior-anterior shear loading Fx was observed for L- folding over the entire range of separations from the dummy to the module, tests with P-folding also revealed low excursions in the anterior-posterior range. Tests with configurations featuring dummy-module separations of 50 mm and 20 mm were also conducted with the neckskin and chin insert. It was only with PF-bags with a separation of 20 mm that slight increases in the peak values of Fx occured; otherwise, the use of neckskin and chin insert had no recognizable effect. With both folding techniques, axial neck forces Fz developed only in the form of tension. The curve is characterized by a brief humpback caused by initial contact of the air bag with the underside of the chin and by a subsequent hump resulting from the membrane loading phase of the bag as it fills. In tests with the thorax closer to the module, the maximum values not only rise, but the first contact phase also begins to predominate over the membrane-loading phase. In all tests, the maximum values remained safely below the reference value of 2.20 kN. The values measured for P-folding, however, were up to 72% less than those registered for L-folding. The neck bending moments My differ greatly from each other, depending on which folding technique is applied. This applies both to the peak values as well as to the general form of the moment graph. Under conditions of conventional folding, only neck extension occurred throughout the entire time range. The highest extension bending moments occurred at a separation of 20 mm. In all LF-bag tests, use of the neckskin led to reduction of the peak value for bending moment. All bending moments measured lay above the IARV of 31 Nm for extension; in some cases the measured values reached 230% of the IARV. In tests with P-folding, on the other hand, all values were below IARV levels. The peak values of the extension moment rose as the separation between dummy and module decreased. The use of the neckskin led to appreciable increase in the maximum values. The graph of P-folding values as a function of time differs greatly from that obtained for L-folding and furthermore varies as a function of the separation between thorax and module. After initial extension, flexion occurred. The peak values of the flexion moment, however, remain with their maximum of 32 Nm far below the IARV of 104.0 Nm for flexion. "FOREHEAD CENTERED ON THE MODULE" Neck loading - The shear loads Fx between head and upper neck with P-folding were comparable to those obtained with L-folding. The shear forces rose as the separation to the module decreased. It was only at a separation of 50 mm that the use of the neckskin with the P-folding technique resulted in an increase of loading in comparison with the same tests without neckskin. For L-folding, on the other hand, a slight decrease in these loads occurred with the neckskin. In all tests, the shear force Fx remained far below the scaled IARV for the small female. For both types of folding the shear load graphs are characterized by an initial peak as a result of the first contact of the air bag or the module door with the mouth region and by a later humpback caused by the action of the membrane force. This second hump disappeared as the separation from the module decreased, whereas the initial peak plays a primary role in determining the neck shear loads. With respect to the compression forces Fz, the P- folding solution demonstrated loads which were significantly reduced from levels gained with the LF- scheme. In all cases, these loads increased as the distance from the forehead to the module decreased. While the highest loads with PF-bags were still sufficiently far below the IARV of 2.67 kN, values from the LF-scheme exceeded this limit without neckskin at a dummy-module distance of 0 mm, the so-called "against-position". 2898</page><page sequence="10">_0 ZD "O O c E .2 c "S ° ^ TD ^ &lt;D il O) il h= 0 §1 O (/) -Q © 0 I- 0 JZ 0 O ll c o E o E e o 'u) e. 0 X 0 Il I I I I E Z3 E - S X m œ 13 ? m G?

For both types of folding the Fz graph shows at a point very near the module an initial peak which resulted from the punchout and which was responsible for loading. The membrane loading phase did not contribute to compression loading, but it did produce a moderate tension load. The tension load, however, was determined to be higher with P-folding at the separation of 0 mm. The graph of the bending moment My between the upper neck and the head is characterized for both types of air bag folding by an initial flexion moment attributed to the punchout. This moment falls and then rises again upon commencement of the membrane- loading phase. Finally, it changes over into the extension area. In tests with the forehead closer to the module, the first humpback in flexion moment builds up and then immediately changes over to extension. The peak values of flexion bending moments in the first phase of air bag deployment increase as the distance from head to module decreases. For all tests, however, these values were considerably below the scaled IARV of 104.0 Nm. Compared with the LF-scheme, tests with P-folding without exception resulted in lower flexion values. The LF-bags had relatively high extension bending moments over the entire range of dummy-module separations which became smaller as the distance to the module decreased. With P-folding, however, extension bending moments were very low at head- module separations of 100 mm and 50 mm, but rapidly increased in tests with smaller separation. The use of neckskin and chin insert increased the extension moment only slightly for L-folding, but led to appreciable increases in peak extension moment values with P-folding. At a forehead-module separation of 0 mm P-folding with neckskin accordingly resulted in values which exceeded the IARV. Air bag - dummy face contact - The application of cosmetic marking material to the dummy's face demonstrated significant differences between the two folding techniques with respect to contact behavior between air bag fabric and dummy skin. With the bag packed according to the LF-scheme traces of extremely smeared cosmetic were found after deployment almost everywhere on the fabric surface, even on the side of the bag facing the steering wheel. The air bag packed according to the PF-scheme, on the other hand, revealed clear cosmetic traces in the form of prints of the dummy face on the fabric, especially in tests in which the dummy head was centered on the module. Analysis of the high-speed films confirmed that the relative sharpness of these facial impressions was due to significantly reduced relative motion between the deploying air bag and the dummy body. DISCUSSION The main configurations selected for the comparative tests - "chest centered on module" and "forehead centered on module" - resulted in varying test findings for the two folding schemes under OOP conditions. "CHEST CENTERED ON THE MODULE" - In tests with the dummy chest centered on the module the use of P-folding resulted in reduction of all thoracic loads in comparison with values obtained from L-folding. Significant load reductions were found especially in PF-pattern tests conducted at close intervals between thorax and module, yet, not so close that the thorax was in contact with the module. Since the punchout effect is determining for VC loading in such configurations, the beneficial capability for the PF-air bag to laterally spread out in a radial manner upon its encounter with an obstacle became especially evident in these tests (Fig. 6). The prerequisite for exploiting this advantage is that at least a small degree of separation exists between dummy and module. If the dummy is extremely close to the module the advantages of P-folding accordingly diminish. With the dummy in the extreme "chest against module" position the test results considerably exceeded the injury criterion of VC = 1.0 m/s for both folding techniques. As already confirmed in other studies, sternum deflection and thorax acceleration do not represent critical injury criteria in this context [2, 4, 10]. In addition to thorax loading, measured neck forces and moments showed significant or critical maximum values. Test results with conventional folding far exceeded the IARV for extension in all tests with the configuration "chest centered on the module". The extension moment remained - for the most part appreciably - below the limit value in tests with P- folding. Horsch et al. have pointed out that the IARV for the extension moment was recommended for hyperextension of the head/neck [2], Since the angular motions at the upper neck were moderate here, exceeding the IARV of 31 Nm does not necessarily imply critical loadings. Yet, the difference between the maximum values for the two folding patterns is evident. On the other hand, since the absolute bending angle in the upper neck region is determining for the degree of hyperextension, even small angular motions might represent an injury risk in combination with high bending moments if the neck is pre-extended prior to air bag triggering. The maximum values for measured shear and axial forces likewise remained safely below the 2902</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 6: Test configuration "chest centered on module", separation 20 mm, 10 ms after air bag triggering. L-folded bag (left) and P-folded bag (right). corresponding IARV limits for both types of folding. The P-folding values, however, were at levels considerably below those obtained with L-folding. The explanation for the significant reduction in overall neck loading lies accordingly in the modified deployment behavior demonstrated by the PF-air bag. It deploys laterally and reaches its final form at an earlier point in time. In contrast, the air bag with L-folding inflates to an extensive degree in the upward direction (Fig. 6). This characteristic produces contact with the neck and the underside of the chin and, subsequently, high loads in these areas. "FOREHEAD CENTERED ON THE MODULE" - Positioning the dummy with the forehead centered on the module changes the situation to some extent. Here, only the loads applied to the neck are significant. Loads on the thorax are negligibly small, and head acceleration criteria reach critical values in none of the tests conducted. However, while HIC 36- and 3ms-values remained under their respective limit values, upon conduct of testing very close to the module extremely high acceleration spikes were recorded caused by contact of the module door with the head. All tests conducted with the configuration "forehead centered on the module" had the common outcome that the initial contact of the air bag or of the cover being torn open resulted in flexion moment and compression force (Fig. 7). The flexion moments and compression forces created during this early phase were appreciably lower with P-folding than with L- folding. In two tests conducted with the dummy forehead contacting the module, compression forces for L-folding exceeded the IARV. Anterior-posterior shear forces Fx were greater for P-folding than for L-folding when the dummy was initially in direct contact with the module. All values, however, were below 50% of the limit. On the other hand, neck extension dominates as the loading representing greatest danger to the occupant. The maximum values of the extension moments occured only after the rearward-accelerated dummy no longer has contact with the inflated air bag. The energy producing the extensive acceleration of the head with respect to thorax and neck is apparently introduced via the chin during the final phase of air bag deployment. While P-folding demonstrated maximum values at test separations of 100 and 50 mm which were significantly lower than those obtained with L-folding, this relationship was reversed at dummy head positioning very close to the module or contacting it. Under these conditions, the maximum extension bending moments from P-folding exceeded those resulting from L-folding. With the forehead against the module and with use of the neckskin and the chin insert, values obtained with P-folding here exceeded the IARV. This phenomenon can be traced to the interaction of the folding scheme with the tear-open mechanism of the module door. Analysis of the high- speed films reveals that the torn-open door becomes wedged in between the deploying air bag and the dummy head situated in front of the module (Fig. 8). When this cover finally slides away from the dummy chin and then flips downward, the potential energy of the portion of the air bag located beneath the cover is suddenly transferred to the underside of the chin. As a result of the different air bag folding scheme, this 2903</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 7: Test configuration "forehead centered on module", separation 20 mm, 10 ms after air bag triggering.

L-folded module P-folded module bag door bag door dummy dummy head head Fig. 8: Test configuration "forehead against module", schematic representation of wedging of the module door with P-folded bag (right), L-folded bag (left). wedging of the module door was not so pronounced with LF-bags and the rearward rotation of the dummy head was likewise gentler. In this context, the high-speed films revealed large bending angles between the lower neck and the thorax in the area C5 - T1 which became visible far earlier than did the maximum extension between head (occipital condyles) and C1. In future tests, therefore, it could prove advisable to additionally measure the forces and moments between the neck and the thorax. Since no lower neck load cell was available at the test facility, there are no data present for neck loading in this area. NECKSKIN AND CHIN INSERT - The use of the neckskin and the chin insert had different influence on neck loads. In tests with the configuration "forehead centered on module" these measures led to an increase in the maximum extension moments, especially in conjunction with P-folding. With the chin insert, the air bag can support itself on the underside of the chin, while otherwise it will "creep" into the empty space behind the dummy jaw. To some degree here, the neckskin has the effect that the point of application of the resulting force onto the chin underside is shifted farther toward the tip of the chin. Therefore, it provides a longer moment arm for extension. With the configuration "chest centered on module", and with the neckskin and the chin insert, use of L-folding results in a slight reduction of bending moment when compared to tests without the neckskin and insert. With PF-bags, on the other hand, tests revealed appreciably greater extension moments than without these items. The present study, as well as similar work conducted earlier, have investigated the maximum values of neck forces and moments separately from each other [2, 4], This was because no reliable limit values were available for combined loading of the neck by several components. McElhaney and Meyers, however, have pointed out that injuries to the cervical spine are rarely the result of only one type of loading and that they are frequently produced by a combination of axial forces and bending moments [11], From this standpoint, improvements introduced in the form of PF-pattern - with reduced flexion moment as well as compression forces in the punchout phase of the configuration "forehead centered on module" - suggest to have an even greater effect. Analysis of the high-speed films for the regions head / upper neck and upper neck / thorax enabled 2904</page><page sequence="16">determination of the angular difference between the initial position of the dummy and the point in time of maximum extension moment. These results, however, demonstrated only slight correlation with the measured bending moments. This finding was corroborated to a certain degree by similar results by Nusholtz et al. in cadaver tests [12], It was not possible to use the peak pressures measured in the air bag module during inflation for the present evaluation, since no correlation became apparent between these pressures and the forces measured. The gas-flow conditions at the measuring point are apparently a determining influence for the measured pressure values. The reaction forces of the air bag exerted on the module mounting increase as the original separation of the dummy from the module decreases. There is a relatively great range of variation in these measured values, however. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In the present study, comparative static tests were conducted on air bags with a driver under out-of- position conditions, and with two different air bag folding schemes. Findings gained from earlier studies involving the use of the Hybrid III small female dummy additionally outfitted with neckskins and chin inserts were incorporated into the present conduct of testing. Testing took place with the two main configurations "chest centered on module" and "forehead centered on module" and with four different distances between dummy and module. The injury-relevant loads on the occupant were measured. In most cases, the use of P-folding reduced biomechanical loads on the thorax and neck. These improvements were significantly in the configuration of the chest centered on the air bag module. In the configuration "forehead centered on module", moreover, neck loads were considerably reduced in most cases. It was only in the case of separations of 20 and 0 mm from the module that P-folding in some cases led to greater neck loads, especially for the extension moment, than obtained with conventional folding. The cause for this unfavorable result with such little or no separation is the effect of the tear- open mechanism of the module door on the overall deployment behavior of the air bag, as well as the resulting loads exerted on the occupant in the membrane-loading phase. With effective design of the module cover tear lines, however, reduction in loading with P-folding may be expected. While the neckskin and chin insert especially led to higher neck loads with PF-scheme and slightly reduced loads with the LF-pattern for the configuration "chest centered on module", both folding patterns revealed higher loadings in a number of tests, but reduced loads in other tests for the configuration "forehead centered on module". Since the differences in neck loads in tests with a neckskin and chin insert were considerable in some cases as compared to tests conducted without these accessories, out-of- position tests should in general be conducted with these items. In order to enable comparison of test results among different test institutes, it will be necessary to standardize neckskins and chin inserts not only for the mid-size male, but also for the small female. They should, on the one hand, produce no change in the force-deformation behavior of the Hybrid III neck, but should, on the other hand, have as humanoid a form as possible. Design of the neckskin and the chin insert as one piece would eliminate the gap between head and neck which otherwise allows the air bag to become snagged. Tests conducted until now concentrated on extreme out-of-position configurations, with direct contact of parts of the body with the module cover. These configurations are based on the assumption of an unbelted occupant. It is certainly feasible, however, to imagine out-of-position scenarios with restrained occupants although reliable information is not available with case figures or the distances between vehicle occupants and the air bag module [2,4], In this sense, possible configurations of occupant - module studied in out-of-position tests should include not only the "against-position" aspect, but also greater separations between dummy and module. The present study demonstrates that conventional folding - even with separation of 100 mm - can readily result in achieving critical neck extension moments for the small female dummy. Even if no critical loadings in this sense are applied to the occupant, cosmetic injuries can indeed occur from bag-slap effects, in the form of reddening the skin and causing abrasions. According to information provided by the NHTSA, the third most-frequent complaint in the USA involving air bag systems concerns burns and injuries of this type [13], The present study suggests that the use of the PF-pattern leads to reduction in abrasion due to relative movement between air bag and skin though further research has to be pursued in this field. During recent months, an increasing number of concepts have been presented which feature sensor detection of occupants endangered by being out-of- position. These strategies all entail considerable expense for sensors and electric lines, some even include inflators with variable output. For the foreseeable future, therefore, implementation of these systems will likely be reserved for luxury-class cars. The P-folding pattern for air bags can not only complement these systems, but even when applied alone can also offer appreciable improvements under out-of-position conditions. 2905</page><page sequence="17">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Sven Beckmann for his assistance in conducting the tests.
