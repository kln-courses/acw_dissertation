<plain_text><page sequence="1">Naturalism and Abstraction in Owo Masks ROBIN POYNOR The art of Owo, Nigeria, has attracted attention since before Europeans en- tered the area in 1902. Ivories picked up in Benin and elsewhere may actually have come from this major eastern Yoruba kingdom whose history has been intertwined with that of Benin for some six hundred years. Fagg noted as early as 1951 (pp. 73-76) that Owo was a major style center whose importance may rival that of Ife or Benin. The objects illus- trated in that article (Figs. 2-4) might be used as an index of an Owo court style. Many other objects, however, defy such categorization. There are object types as well as styles that have been introduced from neighboring areas as a result of migrations into the Owo king- dom. 1 Changes in artistic modes also oc- curred when innovations were intro- duced by skillful carvers who had gained the respect of the community. This paper will focus on style (or perhaps the lack of it) as evidenced in Owo masking tradi- tions, especially as it is manifested in one mask type, the agbodogin (Fig. 1). It will also attempt to address factors that may have contributed to stylistic change. Owo today is a middle-sized, tradi- tional city that was once the capital of an ancient city-state on the eastern edge of Yorubaland. Although it is by no means mainstream Yoruba, the Owos do today consider themselves as part ot that ethnic group. They speak a Yoruba lan- guage. They claim that their ruler, the Olowo, is descended from Odudua, the divine founder of the Yoruba holy city of Ife, from which came, too, their ritual chiefs, the Iloro Ighares. These declara- tions of linkage are backed by ar- chaeological evidence. Naturalistic ter- racotta heads and figures share stylistic affinities with those found in Ife (see Eyo 1972:2-11; Eyo &amp; Willett 1980). However, Owo has a rich history of intermingling cultures. In spite of early Yoruba connec- tions, a greater impact seems to have been made by the Edo kingdom of Benin located a scant 120 kilometers to the south.2 It is evident that there has been meaningful contact between the two for long periods of time (Akintoye 1969, 1971). Indeed, Benin's claim of military suzerainty over Owo by as early as the fifteenth century (Egharevba 1960:14, 23, 32, 80) is in part corroborated by Owo's own oral traditions, which suggest that tribute was paid to the Oba of Benin and that leopard pelts and elephant tusks taken by Owo hunters had to be sent to the Oba.3 Moreover, Owo chiefs adopted Benin titles after periods of Benin-Owo conflict.4 Owo traditions maintain that its princes were trained in the Benin court. Two Olowos in particular are cred- ited with introducing Edo traditions,5 paraphernalia, and objects into Owo, in- cluding court ritual, place names, and chieftaincy costumes. On the other hand, Owo seems to have wielded a great amount of power itself, succeeding periodically in throwing off Benin6 and exposing its own boundaries as far as Kabba in the north, Akoko in the north- east, Okeluse in the south, and Akure in the west. Owo's position as a transitional city between Yoruba and Edo territories made it susceptible to numerous influ- ences. Immigrants, including war re- fugees, losers in succession disputes in other areas, prisoners of war, and slaves brought in by successful Owo war chiefs, swelled the population. It is only to be expected that such con- ditions would produce a lack of stylistic homogeneity in the art forms used out- side the court. The problem of style is especially confusing when we begin to explore the arts associated with mas- querades. Traditionally, masking is linked to lineages and groups that pur- port to have come into Owo in more recent times and that claim as well to have introduced their masking traditions on their arrival. There is a multiplicity ot mask types and mask styles.' Before I introduce a specific mask type, the agbodogin, I want to present several suggestions as to why it has undergone stylistic changes: (1) Artists and craftsmen do not stay in one place. (2) In spite of conservatism in Yoruba art, there is admiration for innovation when it works and when it is introduced by an accepted craftsmen. (3) Traditional teach- ing and learning patterns have changed, at least in recent times. Let me give some specific examples to elaborate on these. As to the first point, some craftsmen moved out of Owo to work in other towns and cities while others went to Owo from other areas; these situations were results of both mi- grations and contracts made with the Olowo. The beadworker Adeyeye Ademola, for example, went to Owo in 1961 at the request of Olowo Olagbegi II, who commissioned him to make a crown. He remained there at least until I interviewed him in 1973. Conversely, Onishile Ogunmola, a carver who was trained in Owo, left the area and carved for ten years in other towns before he re- tired to Owo in the 1970s. Justus Akeredolu, who will figure in this paper later, worked as a carver in Lagos, Benin, Ife, and elsewhere before settling down in Owo, where his unique style made a noticeable impact on its art. The second point, admiration for in- novation and creativity, is illustrated by 1. AGBODOGIN MASQUERADE. OWO, 1973. 56</page><page sequence="2">-. .. ~CL~grj !~~ 2. UDAMALORE. IVORY LENGTH 45.7cm. MUSEUM OF MANKIND, LONDON. FROM FAGG 1951. Obamadeshara, an Owo weaver of the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies. He produced a type of cloth called elegheghe pupa,8 praised for its beauty and elaborateness. Descendants claim that he was not taught to weave his unique patterns, but that they sprang from his own creative mind. The few pieces he made in his lifetime have be- come valued heirlooms. The third factor that may ultimately have made an impact on the introduction and rapid dissemination of styles is the manner in which the crafts are taught. Crafts were traditionally aligned with lineages and passed from generation to generation within the family (e.g., see Lloyd 1953). Children learned by observ- ing their relatives at work and by carry- ing out small tasks for the older members of the family. For example, Onishile Ogunmola told of learning carving from his father, who had learned from his fa- ther, a member of the family of Famakinwa, a nineteenth-century mas- ter. As a result of this family tradition, workshop styles probably continued with only slight variations over long periods of time. Recently, however, this model has changed. In some instances craftsmen take on as apprentices strangers whose families pay fees to the master. This sort of thing can happen even in a craft that is intimately associated with the home and the family, such as women's weaving. Mrs. Olawalu is a weaver of great skill. Probably inspired by the government trade school her husband was directing at the time I was in Owo, she set up a small school at her house, where she trained young women in the art of weav- ing. Her pupils worked with her for a period of two years, weaving on carperi- tered looms rather than on the tradi- tional women's looms made of two up- right posts. The teaching of carving has under- gone the same sort of transition. Boys who have demonstrated some talent may be sent to the workshop of an estab- lished carver. Justus Akeredolu,9 for example, set up an atelier where he trained young men to carve, using them as assistants in his own work (Fig. 5). Akeredolu serves as a point of focus for several of the ideas addressed in this pa- per. He worked both in Owo and elsewhere. He was praised for the intro- duction of the thorn-carving genre. He established his own atelier. Akeredolu made a great impact on the art of Owo from the 1930s into the 1970s. He began experimenting with thorn carving as a boy of about ten, when he made name stamps from thorns of the white cotton tree, decorating the handles with carvings of clenched fists, human heads, and animals. He made his first thorn carving sale in January 1932.10 It was not long before a new tourist art was being produced not only by Akeredolu but by young men whom he had trained in the Owo Government School. As a matter of fact, the best known of the Ni- gerian thorn carvers were his students, including Lamuren of Shagamu and Sadipe at the Nigerian Art Centre in Lagos. In even his earliest carvings, Akeredolu carefully observed the human body and was able to create quite life-like poses together with pleasingly realistic facial features.11 Later carvings demonstrate even more a sense of naturalistic proportion and pose (Fig. 6). After serving as an Owo craft teacher for five years, Akeredolu moved to Lagos to work at the CMS Bookshop and produced commercial art. In his spare time he demonstrated his technique of carving genre figures of thorns at numerous schools in the capital city. He was eventually employed by the De- partment of Antiquities and was sent for museum-related experiences to London, Paris, Denmark, and Sweden.12 While he served as a technical officer, conserv- ing art works of bronze and other mate- rials, he continued to carve thorns (Wil- lett 1986:50). By 1959 Akeredolu had re- turned to Owo to start the Owo Museum for the Department of Antiquities. In Owo, Akeredolu's carving was not limited to thorns. Even before he had 3. OSANMASINMI.

FROM FAGG 1951. moved back permanently, he had ad- vised his pupil Lamuren in the carving of perhaps the best known of the life-sized figures that represent the deceased in ako, a second burial ritual performed in Owo for only a few high chiefs and their mothers. 13 Lamuren's example (Fig. 7) represents the mother of Olowo Olag- begi II.14 A comparison with another ako figure will perhaps indicate the impact that Akeredolu had on traditional art forms. Although each is naturalistically proportioned, the face of the figure rep- resenting the mother of the Sashere of Owo, carved by Ogunleye (Fig. 8),15 is 57</page><page sequence="3">worked in a schematic manner. While both pieces were made around 1943 or 1944, there is a marked difference in style. It seems that at the same time Lamu- ren carved his figure, a second, less naturalistic, representation of the Olowo's mother was carved as well. Lamuren's piece was rejected in favor of the other, which was more in the style of the Sashereako by Ogunleye.16 Was it the naturalism of the Lamuren figure that led to its rejection? Akeredolu main- tained that the Lamuren piece was nevertheless preserved because of its remarkable naturalism. By the time Jus- tine Cordwell documented a fourth ako figure (Fig. 9) in a neighboring village in 1949 (Cordwell 1953:223), naturalism seems to have been acceptable, perhaps in response to the style introduced by Akeredolu and disseminated by those he had trained in the Owo Government School. Akeredolu and his students carved traditional mask types as well. In fact, I believe that a great number of masks in Owo were made either by his atelier or by other artists responding to the popu- larity of his naturalistic style. Many of them also produced the thorn carvings he introduced. Akeredolu's renown as the inventor of the thriving thorn-carving industry, his recognition as a person of importance in the government Department of An- tiquities, and his success as a teacher probably all worked in concert to allow him to make as big an impact as he did on the art style of Owo in the middle de- cades of this century. The fact that he had trained boys in the Owo Government School and that he had set up an atelier helped in the rapid spread and accep- tance of the Akeredolu naturalistic style. Yet, perhaps the most important im- pact on style in such a transitional area as Owo is the presence of immigrant peoples who have brought with them their own art objects and styles. Exam- ples of such introductions into Owo abound. Brass heads used on the ances- tral altar of the Ojomo of Owo (Fig. 11) are obviously Benin in origin. A wooden stool used by the Anaun Sadibo (Fig. 10) undoubtedly has Northern Edo origins. Masks especially are associated with foreign elements and are thus more likely to be carved in alien styles. Let me introduce one mask type to il- lustrate what I've been working toward: agbodogin (Figs. 12-23, 25). It always has a white face trimmed in black, and in almost all examples there are noticeable geometric features. These traits are foreign to Yoruba art and to most Owo art. Yet the agbodogin, as well as another mask, urogho (Fig. 24), persist with the color scheme, and agbodogin and another mask, elu, continue the use of these geometric features. Yoruba groups to the west do not use such masks, but numer- ous non-Yoruba groups to the south and east are known for black-trimmed, white-faced types with geometric fea- tures. Precisely which groups brought these masks into Owo is not recorded in its oral traditions. The origin story for ag- bodogin states that a woman found it on the farm, atop a yam support. Her hus- band took it from her and used it as an egun. The story suggests that the mask type is considered old. Furthermore, it was not merely brought into Owo but was actually adopted for use in Owo egun masquerades. By 1973, when I was in Owo, agbodogin was one of thirty mask types (Poynor 1978a) used to honor the ancestors at the yearly egun per- formances of various Owo lineages, and there was a wide range of stylistic varia- tions within the type. Perhaps the best known agbodogin is in the Barclay collection in London (Fig. 12). It was acquired by Celia Barclay's father, Maurice Cockin, around 1910, when he was District Officer assigned to Owo.'7 On the basis of R.E. Bradbury's having seen such masks in the village of Amahor in the Ishan area of Northern Edo coun- try, William Fagg has identified the style as Ishan (1970:123). Although I did not collect any specific references to Ishan people entering Owo as a group, there were those who came from Northern Edo areas during periods of unrest for protection by the Olowo. A second Barclay mask (Fig. 13), collected at the same time as the one in Figure 12, seems to share stylistic characteristics . if . ? 1- - jot 5.

IT REP- RESENTS THE MOTHER OF THE SASHERE OF OWO. FROM WILLETT 1966. with it and is likely to have been intro- duced from the same source. My first re- sponse to this information was that Ishan immigrants must have been among the Northern Edo immigrants and that the style was introduced some- time prior to 1910, when Cockin collected his masks. My hopes of confirming such an origin rose when Carol Ann Lorenz wrote me18 that during fieldwork in Ishan in 1980, she discovered a type of mask (Fig. 26) similar to the Barclay example among the variety of masks preserved by the Onojie, or local ruler, of Amahor. The mask is called okpodu, as are other masks associated with a particular ancestral masquerade. Although masks are found all over Ishan, this particular type, ac- cording to Lorenz, is found only in Amahor. She discovered, however, that the masks in this village are attributed to a Yoruba carver who lived and worked there during the reign of the present Onojie's father, which would be between 1910 and 1937, in other words, about the time or after Cockin collected our first example in Owo. In addition, the people distinguished the style of the mask from others by calling it okpodu ekule, meaning "Yoruba" okpodu. Furthermore, Lorenz discovered, when the Yoruba carver left Amahor the style of carving was not con- tinued, and there was no development of the mask type as there was in Owo. Moreover, the examples left in Ishan are not used in masquerades now but are preserved in shrines as relics of the past. It is thus unlikely that the style is really Ishan, considering the fact that it is found only in one village in the area, that it was used for only a short period of time, and that it is referred to as Yoruba by those who know it. It is enticing to suggest another Edo origin, one closer to the capital city of Benin: the Bini villages. It is clear that court arts would have been introduced into Owo because of the nature of the as- sumed relationship between Owo and sovereign Benin. We accept the fact that such forms as the osanmasinmi (Figs. 4, 11) and the ako (Figs. 7-9), associated with the Owo court, ultimately derived from Benin. It is entirely possible that village arts from the Edo area were introduced as well. Among the masking traditions used in the Bini area the best known are those of the Ekpo cult. Ekpo is a village associa- tion whose purpose seems to be to pro- vide opposition as well as linkage to the central government of the kingdom (Ben-Amos 1980:57; 1969:10). It was founded by Agboghidi, Enogie or head of Ugo, a town to the east of the capital (Ben-Amos 1969:13). The comparison of the words agbodogin and agboghidi is tan- talizing, yet risky. Among the masks used in Ekpo are several with white faces trimmed in black. Both the iyekpo mask, which represents the grandmother of Agboghidi, and the akpama mask, which represents a chief, may be compared to agbodogin. The white face is set off by a dark band (red, in the case of these two masks) beneath the chin that represents a collar of coral beads and may be com- pared to the beard of the agbodogin. A dark band across the forehead repre- sents the coral band worn by chiefs and 9. AKO FIGURE CARVED IN 1949. IT REPRESENTS THE CHIEF OF A VILLAGE OUTSIDE OWO. FROM CORDWELL 1953. may be compared to the coiffure of the agbodogin. Is it possible that such forms could have been misinterpreted or mis- read by foreign "borrowers" of a mask type? The fact that the iyekpo, a female mask, is considered the senior mask is interesting in light of the fact that agbodo- gin is sometimes referred to as female. Another intriguing visual comparison might be made with monkey repre- sentations on a Benin brass stool in the Museum fiir V61olkerkunde, Berlin. It is obvious that these do not represent masks. Yet, the agbodogin is sometimes referred to as a monkey in Owo. The placement of the ears, the conception of the mouth, and the configuration of the cheek and eye area of the monkey faces on the Benin stool compare favorably with the forms of the agbodogin masks of Owo. Where did the mask type originate? It is not Ishan, as suggested by Fagg, nor is it Yoruba, as suggested by Lorenz's Yoruba informants. The connection to the Ekpo cult of the Bini is tenuous at best. The intensely abstract and geomet- ric style of agbodogin is, to Yoruba sen- sibilities, as foreign as or more foreign 59</page><page sequence="5">than the extreme naturalism of Akeredolu. Since the general white- faced style and a number of geometric styles are used not only in the Edo area but over a broad area to the southeast of Owo and Ishan, we can only refer to that of the Barclay mask (Fig. 12) as a "south- eastern prototype" style. Some Owo representations of agbodo- gin are close to the southeastern pro- totype in their hard, abstracted geomet- ricity (Figs. 14-18). Yet the white-faced type is also produced in a naturalistic style onto which certain geometric fea- tures are grafted to maintain "type" re- quirements (Figs. 21-23, 25). Other examples provide evidence of the nuance of styles between the two ex- tremes of abstraction and naturalism (Figs. 19-20). None fit the "traditional" Owo style description. The mask type seems to be deter- mined by several consistent features. The primary one, maintained in all examples that I am able to document, is the color scheme. The face is painted white. A beard carved in relief and an elaborate hairstyle are painted black. Other details are picked out in black as well. Many pieces have a small area of red applied somewhere between the bridge of the nose and the hairline. On a number of examples (Figs. 12, 16, 18) the face is conceived as a concave area, giving a marked geometric charac- ter to the entire mask. A geometric character extends as well to at least some of the features on most of the masks. The nose, for instance, is conceived as a curved plane or as two planes running from between the eyes out to or beyond the corners of the mouth on twelve of the thirteen masks I was able to photograph (Figs. 12-22, 25). The geometric quality is continued in the mouth, which stretches as a raised area across the face of nine examples (Figs. 12-18, 20, 22). The ears are placed high on the head of six of the agbodogin (Figs. 12-15, 20, 23), suggesting that the mask was conceived as an animal rather than a human being. As a matter of fact, it is described by some informants as a monkey mask. A black line extending from the forehead to the tip of the nose is present on six of the examples (Figs. 12, 16-18, 22, 25), and a seventh one (Fig. 23) has a red line ex- tending from the hairline to the bridge of the nose, probably in reference to the black line on other agbodogin. These are the traits that seem to have been introduced by immigrants into Owo. It is obvious on even a casual glance, however, that there are charac- teristics that are to varying degrees naturalistic. The positioning of facial fea- tures begins in some of the masks to ap- proximate more realistically their rela- tionship on the human face (Figs. 16-20, 22). In some pieces, individual features begin to receive more anthropomorphic treatment. For example, although the mouth and nose are still very geometric on one mask (Fig. 18), the ears are placed fairly low, more in keeping with the placement of human ones, and the gen- eral shape is that ot a human ear, al- though stylized. In the "prototype" mask (Fig. 12), the eyes are geometrically shaped openings cut into the curved plane at the juncture of the nose and brow (see also Figs. 13- 19). In two examples (Figs. 20, 21), the eyes are more naturalistically human - almond shaped, with well-formed lids surrounding the opening through which the wearer sees. In still other masks (Figs. 22, 23, 25) the eyes have been treated sculpturally; lids and eyeballs are carved naturalistically, with painted irises. The openings through which the wearer sees are cut below the lower lid, on the cheek. In the prototype style, the lips are two large geometric forms separated from each other and filled with teeth (Figs. 12-18). In some masks the teeth are ac- centuated, made of another material and inserted so that they jut out, leaving a large gap in the cenfer (Figs. 15-17). Gapped, buck teeth are considered beau- tiful in Owo, where such representations are almost standard on many art forms (e.g., the osanmasinmi in Fig. 11). In still other examples (Figs. 20-23, 25), the art- ist has given the lips contour, coloring them suggestively red, and allowing the gapped teeth to show between the parted lips. The almost sensuous treat- ment of the mouth has to do, I believe, with a misunderstanding of the original meaning of the mask. While some in- formants stated that the agbodogin repre- sents a monkey, and some indeed appear to be somewhat simian, there are others, including carvers, who stated that the mask portrays a beautiful woman. Lorenz's Amahor informants referred to it as the "wife" or "servant" of the ances- 10. THE ANAUN SADIBO OF OWO WITH HIS WOODEN STOOL. THE STYLE OF THE STOOL IS RELATED TO THAT OF THE NORTHERN EDO.

That ag- bodogin is conceived of as a female in Owo is suggested not only by the sensu- ousness of some of the examples, but also by the fact that five of the thirteen I have seen have pele marks, painted cosmetic marks worn by women (Figs. 19, 21-23, 25). In spite of this, each of the beautiful women sports a beard, an ob- viously masculine trait that appears on all of the masks. Such inconsistencies suggest that perhaps a male mask was introduced and has been misunderstood as female in both Owo and Amahor, or that some other element has been trans- lated into a form that resembles a beard. The strange assortment of masks that are called agbodogin ranges in style from acutely geometric and stylized to quite naturalistic. None of them seem to have any stylistic affinity to objects in the tra- ditional Owo court style. The explana- tion seems to be that the mask type itself was an import in the late nineteenth cen- tury. The geometric style was maintained with some degree of consistency into this century, until the innovative naturalism introduced by Justus Akeredolu and continued by his apprentices and emulators was transferred in differing degrees to examples of the type. If one considers the understandable misun- derstandings concerning the forms of an imported object and the slight changes that crept into locally made copies, it is not surprising that the mask seems to have changed incredibly after the mod- ern naturalism of Akeredolu was intro- duced. When the extremes of the stylistic range of agbodogin are placed next to each other (Figs. 12, 23), it is almost inconceiv- able that they are from the same place, much less of the same sort.

I discuss the introduction of various styles and object types in "Edo Influence on the Arts of Owo" (1976). 2. For specific influences refer to Poynor 1976. 3. Oshogboye, the sixteenth Olowo, was said to have been trained in the court of Benin. Was he there because the two royal families were related, as Owo tradition states, or was he there as a royal hostage, as Benin tradition suggests? Beyond the oral traditions, the structure of the Owo court is modeled after that of Benin. Great numbers of chieftaincy titles obvi- ously have Benin origins. See Poynor 1976 for specifics. 4. A number of Owo titles seem to derive directly from Be- nin, as suggested by the Benin Edaiken and the Owo Idani- ken. Other sets of titles include the Ezomo of Uzebu/the Ojomo of Ujebu; Oliha/Olisa; Uwangwe/Unwagwe; Ologbo- shere/Ologboshere; Ero/Ero; Eriyo/Ariyo; Eribo/Aribo. 5. Oshogboye was said to be a sword bearer to the Oba of Benin in the sixteenth century, before he left to be crowned the sixteenth Olowo. Elewuokun reigned during the eigh- teenth century and was very much a "Beninizer" of the Owo court. He introduced Benin-style court garments and changed the names of several chieftaincies to Benin-derived names. 6. Egharevba 1960:154. According to Benin sources, the war chief Iken had to recapture Owo, and for a period of time Benin forces were repelled. Iken was eventually killed by Owo forces. 7. I discuss Owo masking traditions in "The Egungun of Owo" (1978). 8. I discuss this cloth briefly in "Traditional Textiles in Owo, Nigeria" (1980). 9. Frank Willett recently (1986) published a tribute to Akeredolu. An earlier reference to Akeredolu is "Thorn Carv- ing by Native Nigerian Artist" (1947). 10. I discussed these topics with Akeredolu occasionally dur- ing my stay in Owo in 1973. Notes of October, 1973, indicate that Akeredolu's evolution of thorn carving began in the early 1930s. 11. Willett 1986:50. Willett's article provides photographs of thorn carvings produced in the 1930s. 12. Justus Akeredolu, personal communication, May 1973. 13. The figure is carved during a lengthy ceremony lasting seventeen days. In the past, these were apparently as stylized as any other Owo art form. In the twentieth century they be- came quite naturalistic and have been compared by Owo in- formants to photographs of the deceased. Theako figures and ritual are discussed in Willett 1966, Abiodun1976, and Poynor 1978. 14. Willett took a photograph of this ako in 1958. I photo- graphed the object myself in 1973. The upper part of the fig- ure was stolen from the Department of Antiquities Building on the palace grounds in Owo in August 1973. 15. The Sashere ako was also photographed by Frank Willett in 1958, when he and William Fagg were allowed to see the pieces of the disconnected figure stored in the attic of the Sashere compound. I found a slide of a photograph of what appears to be the same figure in ritual context in the slide collection at the University of Iowa. William Fagg told me this was of a photograph of the Sashere ako he was shown in Owo. 16. I came upon a photograph of the ako that was used in the ceremony in Owo in 1973. I was not able to purchase a copy, but I was allowed to photograph it. The image I got was ex- tremely fuzzy, but it does reveal that the piece that was actu- ally used was more like the Sashere object in style, and much less naturalistic than the Lamuren figure that was preserved. 17.
