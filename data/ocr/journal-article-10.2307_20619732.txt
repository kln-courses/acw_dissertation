MURRAY Until 1530, sculptural images of Confucius and varying numbers of disciples and later followers received semiannual sacrifices in state-supported temples all over China. The icons' visual features were greatly influenced by the posthumous titles and ranks that emperors conferred on Confucius and his followers, the same as for deities in the Daoist and Buddhist pantheons. This convergence led to visual conflation and aroused objections from Neo-Confucian ritualists, culminating in the ritual reform of 1530, which replaced images with inscribed tablets and Confucius s kingly title with the designation Ultimate Sage and First Teacher. However, the ban on icons did not apply to the primordial temple of Confucius in Qufu, Shandong. Post-1530 gazetteers publicized the distinction by reproducing a line drawing of this temples sculptural icon, and persistent replications of this image helped to popularize his cult. The same period saw a proliferation of non-godlike representations of Confucius, including his por trayal as a teacher, whose iconographic origins can be traced to a painted por trait handed down through generations of his descendants. In recent years, variations of this teacher image have become the basis for new sculptural rep resentations, first in Taiwan, then in Hong Kong and the Chinese diaspora, and finally on the mainland. Now installed at sites around the world, statues of Confucius have become a contested symbol of Chinese civilization. Recent scholarship on religious elements in the ideas, institutions, and practices associated with Confucius (Kongzi ?L^) and his later interpreters has done much to correct long-standing representations of Confucianism as a form of secular humanism (Chen 1999; Clart 2003; Csikszentmihalyi 2001; Goossaert 2006; Jensen 1997; Wilson 2002a).1 Revisionist inquiry has also brought attention to the recurrent debates over the propriety of using icons in Julia K. Murray (jmurrav@wisc.edu) is Professor of Art History, East Asian Studies, and Religious Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The convenient though problematic terms "Confucian" and "Confucianism" are used here to refer to Confucius s teachings and their later interpretations, as well as to certain aspects of ideology, institutions, and rituals of governance in dynastic times. It seems particularly appropriate to use the terms in referring to teachings for which Confucius was considered the progenitor and whose differences from Buddhism and Daoism are articulated in Han Yu's $$ 1&amp; (768-824) famous diatribe "Source of the Way" (Yuan dao WM). For a fuller discussion of terms, see Mark Csikszentmihalyi (2001, 243-44, 292-97).</page><page sequence="2">372 Julia K. Murray rituals for venerating Confucius (Sommer 1994, 2002). However, the significance of the physical and visual qualities of these icons has not been addressed. No matter whether Confucianism is viewed as primarily a moral-ethical system or as a sacrificial cult mandated and supported by the state, it clearly differs from Buddhism, Daoism, and other forms of religious expression in China. Accord ingly, a discussion of the materiality, visuality, and efficacy of its icons might seem unnecessary, irrelevant, or perhaps even offensive. Nonetheless, iconic images played a role in sacrifices to Confucius at least as early as the sixth century, and from 630 to 1530, sculptural icons were a standard feature of state supported temples throughout China (Murray 2001; Wilson 1995). When influ ential opponents of icons finally prevailed and temples in the state cult removed the sculptural figures (Sommer 1994, 2002), alternative representations of Con fucius rose in significance and took on new functions (Murray 2001, 2002). Recently, one of these has become the "standard image" of Confucius, in effect the icon for our age. Confucian Religiosity Various efforts in recent centuries to foreground the moral dimension of Confuciuss legacy have obscured practices and beliefs involving icons, along with other religious aspects of Confucianism. During the sixteenth and seven teenth centuries, Jesuit missionaries tried to convince papal authorities in Rome that Confucianism was an ethical philosophy (Jensen 1997, 63-70, 129), so that efforts to spread Christianity in China would not be stymied by requiring converts to give up rituals for worshiping Confucius Similarly, in the nineteenth century, the Protestant missionary-translator James Legge argued that the ancient Confucian classics merely needed to be supplemented with Christianity, just as the Bibles Old Testament was completed by the New Testament (Mungello 2003, 590). Moreover, from the sixteenth century onward, Confucian temples were austere buildings where inscribed tablets were displayed, unlike Buddhist temples and popular-cult shrines with sculptural icons in sensuous pro fusion.2 Although Kang Youwei JfrSf^ (1858-1927) sought to establish Confu cianism as Chinas official religion (zongjiao tk ifc) at the end of the nineteenth century, on the model of Christianity in Western nations, he made little headway before falling from power in the coup that reversed his 1898 reforms (Chen 1999; Goossaert 2005, 2006). Because regular worship of Confucius was on the official Register of Sacrifices (Sidian IE ft), and thus was closely identified 2Henri Dore, a nineteenth-century French Jesuit missionary, suggested that Buddhism and Daoism introduced "superstitious" beliefs and practices into Chinese religion (Yu 1973, 384). Dore's ency clopedic compendium also included a lengthy presentation on annotated illustrations of the life of Confucius, which he considered a major means of disseminating Confucian morality among the broad populace (Dore 1911-38, vol. 13).</page><page sequence="3">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 373 with the imperial system, the collapse of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) undercut subsequent efforts to create a religion based on Confucianism. In the early decades of the twentieth century, some nationalist modernizers wanted to discard Confucius altogether, while others found it expedient to present him as Chinas counterpart to the Wests great rational philosophers. Suppressing what they considered to be idolatry and superstition, they emphasized a Confucius who did not concern himself with "ghosts and spirits." And in recent years, global advocates of "New Confucianism" have focused on his ideas about self-cultivation and morality.3 To some, Confucian concepts of reciprocal respon sibility in a hierarchical society suggest an Asian alternative to Western-style democracy. These different efforts have created a widespread conception of Con fucianism that is defined by a set of ancient texts, the civil service examination system based on their mastery, and the promotion of social virtues such as ben evolence (ren t), filial piety (xiao #), propriety (li Wt), and righteousness (yi ?). In addition to revisiting the arguments in favor of establishing Confucianism as the official religion for modern China (Chen 1999; Goossaert 2005, 2006), recent scholarship has begun to examine some of the important religious elements within traditional Confucianism. These include ideas about Confucius himself, as well as the rituals for venerating the man and his legacy. Lionel M. Jensen (1997, 2002), Mark Csikszentmihalyi (2001, 2002), and Thomas A. Wilson (2002a, 2002b) have explored ancient and persistent beliefs in Confucius as a heaven-sent being with superhuman powers. Huang Chin-hsing (1994) and Wilson (1995,1996, 2002b, 2002c) have traced the evolution of an official cult for venerating Confucius and Confucian learning within the ritual institutions of the state, which constituted Chinas "official religion" (Taylor 1997). Ron Guey Chu (1998) and Huang Chin-hsing (2002) have evaluated recurrent debates over the details of these ritual provisions and the appropriate status to attribute to Confu cius, interpreting the disputes as symptoms of an ongoing struggle between emperors and scholar-officials to define and control Confucius and his legacy. Philip Clart (2003) has analyzed popular religious cults that identify themselves as "Confucian" (Ru iff) and use simplified forms of Confucian sacrificial liturgy. Deborah A. Sommer (1994, 2002) has examined different ways of representing Confucius in ancestral and state sacrifices, focusing particularly on the arguments raised against depicting him in sculptural icons, which were adopted into official policy in the ritual reform of 1530. In the present article, I describe the process by which sculptural icons became part of the cult of Confucius and examine reasons for their godlike visual features. Exploring the beliefs concerning agency, efficacy, and appropri ateness that gradually accrued to these icons, I suggest that the representations shared conceptual premises and interpretative connotations with the potent 3I use the term "New Confucianism" in its loosest sense; John Makeham (2003, 25-54) decon structs the movements diverse strands.</page><page sequence="4">374 Julia K. Murray images associated with Buddhism, Daoism, and popular-deity cults. Finally, I argue that the removal of icons from most state temples in 1530 had unintended effects that demonstrate the limits of official control over image-based practices involving Confucius. One result was that the icon of Confucius uniquely retained by the temple in his hometown of Qufu ft Shandong, gained renown through woodblock-printed illustrations that circulated widely, even reaching Europe. The iconography of his seated figure dressed in imperial regalia was eventually appropriated into popular religion, representing Confucius as a deity who could be worshiped by the common people. Another consequence of removing icons from Confucian temples was to bring increased veneration to a radically different depiction, showing Confucius as a dignified standing figure who was merely human. Ultimately based on a small painting owned by his descendants, this conception circulated in hanging scroll paintings, woodblock prints, and rub bings from incised stone tablets. Local gazetteers often recorded versions of the portrayal in government schools and private academies. When the 1970s brought new demands for freestanding representations of Confucius outside mainland China, the image was translated into three-dimensional sculptural form for display at selected sites around the world. In the late twentieth century, such statues also began appearing at mainland temples and schools, prompting the China Confucius Foundation (Zhongguo Kongzi jijinhui *p H ?L 3? &amp; #*) to identify a need for a "standard portrait" (biaozhun xiang Ig 2p f^). In 2006, the foundation unveiled a large new statue of Confucius in Qufu itself, sparking a new controversy over the validity of visual representations of Confucius and their uses. Background to the Emergence of Icons Early Han texts sometimes characterize Confucius as a godlike sage, the heaven-sent "uncrowned king" (Su wang H EE) (Csikszentmihalyi 2001, 2002; Elman 1990, xxvii, 205-13, 240-41; Jensen 1997; Wilson 1995, 29-32).4 They describe supernatural elements in his nativity and his extraordinary physical appearance as signs of his destiny to order the world. He was conceived when his mother received a visit from a qilin ? ?, a fabulous beast believed to herald the arrival of a sage-king. The creature carried a jade tablet inscribed with a proclamation: "The child of the essence of water will succeed the declining Zhou and become an uncrowned king" (shuijing ziji shuai Zhou er wei su wang 4This conception of Confucius was particularly associated with the so-called modern texts (Jin wen 'nX), whose most prominent advocate was Dong Zhongshu it {&lt;? (ca. 179-ca. 104 BCE). Advo cates paid great attention to portents and read heavenly correlations even into seemingly mundane events mentioned in the classics, while believing that only a sage could have a true understanding of the workings of the cosmos.</page><page sequence="5">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 375 7X fit H M rfff ? ? i).5 On the night before Confucius was born, two dragons appeared above the roof; deities hovered in the sky and celestial musicians cele brated on the day of his birth. In addition to forty-nine distinguishing marks (biao 3?) on the newborn s body, his chest bore five characters that announced, "Talis man of the one created to stabilize the world" (zhi zuo ding shifu M fcfeHk fit).6 As an adult, Confucius displayed an uncanny expertise in identifying obscure ancient relics and interpreting mysterious portents. His ability to communicate with heaven enabled him to transmit the Way of the Ruler, in coded language, when he composed the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu # $c), a chronicle of events in his home state of Lu #. Other conceptions of Confucius emphasized his roles as a teacher and as an expert on ancient ritual, instead of as a preternaturally insightful and prescient leader who communed with heaven. In some parts of the Analects (Lun yu im In), Confucius is portrayed as a human being who endured much travail and disappoint ment, especially while traveling the ancient states in search of a ruler who would take his advice (Csikszentmihalyi 2002).7 By the late Eastern Han period, this more mundane Confucius had largely overshadowed the superhuman figure. Nonethe less, the messianic sage was featured in the so-called apocryphal texts (weishu It H) of the late Han and post-Han periods (e.g., Wang Jia 1966,3:4?5). In addition, the "modern text" traditions retained their vitality in South China well into the Period of Disunion (Wilson 1995, 32). Furthermore, the Kong lineage perpetuated and embellished the legends in oral traditions and written genealogies, even down to the present day.8 Claiming descent from Confucius, lineage members had a vital interest in preserving a heroic conception of their ancestor and in maintaining their own cohesion (Wilson 1996). Emperors from the Han through the Qing dynas ties awarded noble titles, tax exemptions, official positions, and lands to the descen dants who maintained sacrifices to Confucius in Qufu. Although the earliest forms of veneration and sacrifice to Confucius occurred in funerary and memorial contexts, the observances themselves increasingly 5According to Five Phases (ton xing 5 fx) theory, the Shang dynasty was associated with water and the Zhou with wood, which overcomes water. However, Confucius s forebears were related to the Shang royal house, and water cannot overcome wood, so Confucius was destined not to rule. 6Texts written by members of the Kong lineage (e.g., Kong Chuan ([1134] 1967, xia: 3b; Kong Yuancuo [1242] 1967, 8:4a) record six characters, adding yun 31 to the end of the inscription, without changing its meaning. 7Confucius seems to have multiple personalities in the Analects, which records diverse traditions transmitted by his disciples and their lineages of students; Makeham (1996) provides a convincing reconstruction of its emergence as a book in the second century BCE. 8All Kong-clan genealogies of the last thousand years include the hagiographical legends. For early examples, see Kong Chuan ([1134] 1967, xia: 3b) and Kong Yuancuo ([1242] 1967, 8:3b-4a). Con temporary Kongs maintain the stories (Kong Demao 1982, 103-4; Jing 1996, 30). Literati officials did not necessarily believe in the supernatural manifestations, but they respected the long history of the accounts too much to discard them. Chen Gao (or Hao; jinshi 1487) W. ?, education intendant in the Shandong Provincial Surveillance office, made explicit comments to this effect in the first edition of the Qufu temple gazetteer (Queli zhi 1505, fanli, lb).</page><page sequence="6">376 Julia K. Murray displayed the features of a deity cult. Confucius continued to receive sacrifices at his grave long past the normal period for commemorative worship (Jensen 2002, 180-86; Sima 1982, 47:1945). Moreover, persons with no blood relation to him made these offerings, contrary to the customs of familial worship, which prescribed that a son should lead funerary rites?but Confucius s son had predeceased him. After Confucius died in 479 BCE, his disciples carried out the rites of mourning, and the especially devoted Zi Gong M kept a six-year vigil in a hut beside the burial mound (Sima 1982, 47:1945). Local authorities maintained offerings at this site for generations afterward. The place where Confucius had gathered with his disciples became a memorial hall, and his personal effects were displayed there. The Grand Historian Sima Qian ^Igl (145-86 BCE) reported seeing the masters clothes, cap, zither (qin #), books, sacrificial vessels, and carriage in the memorial hall when he visited Qufu. In 195 BCE, the Han founding emperor Gaozu (r. 206-195 BCE) performed a grand sacrifice (tailao X ?) to Confucius in Qufu, offering an ox, sheep, and pig, along with wine and other foodstuffs (Sima 1982, 47:1945-46). In 136 BCE, Han Wudi (r. 141-87 BCE) canonized the textual tradition of Confucius and his followers by abolishing the posts of Erudite (boshi W ?) held by court scholars who were experts in texts belonging to other traditions (Wilson 1995, 29). Other Han emperors awarded posthumous titles of nobility to Confucius and gave material support to his descendants and cult, providing for semiannual sacrifices in Qufu after 169 CE (Wilson 2002c, 261). By the third century, sacrifices to Confucius were also being performed elsewhere, typically in academic settings. The first sacrifice documented outside Qufu took place in 241 CE at the imperial university (Biyong M) in Luoyang, the capital of the kingdom of Wei (220-65), and several more were per formed there under the Western Jin dynasty (265-316) (Wilson 2002b, 74).9 During the centuries of disunion, various northern and southern regimes estab lished state-sponsored temples in their capitals for conducting sacrifices to Con fucius and his legacy.10 The Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907) dynasties continued this practice in a reunified empire. The Tang founding emperor Gaozu (r. 618-26) established a temple at the National University (Guozi xue S ^ ?) in Chang'an (modern Xi'an, Shaanxi) and personally sacrificed there in 624 (Ouyang 1975, 1:9, 17). The Tang eastern capital at Luoyang also had an 9A reference to images of Confucius and his disciples painted on the walls of the Hongdu Gate $t U PI school in the Eastern Han capital in 178 may indicate that sacrifices were already being offered in Luoyang by the late second century, but the fifth-century source does not specify this (Fan 1965, 60 xia: 1998). 10Thomas A. Wilson (2002b, 51) notes that in 454, the Liu-Song ruler Xiaowudi (r. 452-64) built the first temple to Confucius south of the Yangzi River, modeled on that in Qufu (see also Li 1975,2:47, 58). Wilson speculates that the temple stood in Kuaiji # H, home of several prominent Kongs, but I think it was more likely to have been in Jiankang It 0 (Nanjing.). In 489, the Northern Wei ruler Xiaowendi (r. 471-99) founded a temple to Confucius in the capital at Pingcheng ? ^ [modern Datong * m, Shanxi] (Li 1974, 3:104).</page><page sequence="7">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 377 imperially sponsored temple. Initially, it was the Duke of Zhou JH the wise regent to the young heir of the Zhou dynasty founder, who was honored as First Sage (Xian sheng % M), and Confucius received sacrifice as Correlate (Fei SB) and First Teacher (Xian shi % 05). In 628, a memorial submitted by Fang Xuanling M ? Hp (579-648) convinced the Tang emperor Taizong (r. 626-49) that sacrifices offered in a school should be directed to a teacher. Accordingly, Taizong ended sacrifices to the Duke of Zhou and designated Con fucius as First Sage, with the disciple Yan Hui II d? as Correlate and First Teacher (Ouyang 1975, 15:373, 375).11 Taizong extended the cult to lower levels of administration in 630 by requiring every prefectural and county school to build a temple to Confucius, thus creating a systematic network of state-sponsored temples (Ouyang 1975, 15:373). Located inside or adjacent to the government schools, these temples carried out regular sacrifices to Confucius twice a year, in spring and autumn. Tang ritual codes ranked the sacrifice to Confucius as one of several mid-level rites (zhong si IE), prescribing specific implements, offerings, music, and partici pants.12 The liturgy imitated that of another mid-level state cult, the worship of the Gods of Soils and Grains (Sheji tt ?), which had existed in classical antiquity and whose rituals were prescribed in the Record of Rites (Liji it IE). Because the cer emony for sacrifice to Confucius had no fixed classical form of its own, it was suscep tible to innovations, and procedural details often changed. Most significantly, portrait icons were introduced into the ceremony, probably inspired by the images of the Buddha and bodhisattvas in Buddhist temples. Starting in the Tang period, the Chan Buddhist practice of using portrait effigies in memorial rituals for deceased abbots and monks (Foulk and Sharf 1993-94) provided an additional model that encouraged the use of icons in Confucian temples. The Earliest Icons of Confucius and Their Visual Features Sculptural images had appeared in the Qufu temple by the sixth century, if not earlier, when Li Daoyuan S ? jv (d. 527) reported that it displayed statues of Con fucius flanked by two unnamed disciples holding scrolls (Li Daoyuan [527] 1984, 25:807).13 Such a triad shares the conceptual logic of a figure of the Buddha accompanied by bodhisattvas, a familiar composition in sixth-century Buddhist 11Fangs memorial also pointed out that Confucius had previously been recognized as First Sage and Yan Hui as First Teacher, until the Daye -k ? era (605-16) of the Sui dynasty. 12There were three levels of state rituals; for details of the liturgy for Confucius, see Wilson (2002b, 72-77). Howard J. Wechsler (1985) discusses Tang debates on ritual and the various codifications. 13The triad is mentioned in a note in the River Si (Si shui M A) section of Shuijing zhu; in citing it, the compilers of Qufu Kongmiao jianzhu (1987, 54) speculate that the flanking figures were the disciples Yan Hui and Zi Gong. Another mid-sixth-century source explicitly mentions that these two disciples accompanied Confucius in images displayed in Luoyangs National University before 534 (Yang Xuanzhi 1978, 1:1) .</page><page sequence="8">378 Julia K. Murray icons, as well as in Daoist imitations. By 541, the figures of ten disciples attended Confucius in the Qufu temple (Kong Yuancuo [1242] 1967, 10:8a-llb).15 Again, the tableau suggests a conceptual counterpart in Buddhist iconography, the ten major disciples of Sakyamuni, which may have inspired the increase. The temple to Confucius in the Tang capital also housed sculptural images, prob ably from its inception in 619, and certainly by the eighth century. Officials who memorialized the throne on matters of ritual procedure and nomenclature rarely mentioned icons explicitly, but one episode is suggestive. In 720, Li Yuanguan $ je ii pointed out to Emperor Xuanzong (or Ming Huang, r. 712-56) that the ten disciples (called Ten Savants, Shi zhe + *S) who received sacrifices along with Confucius should be represented as seated images (zuo xiang ?), not as standing attendants (Ii shi iL f?). Furthermore, Li requested that seventy other disciples and followers of Confucius be portrayed in paintings on the walls of the temple, so that they, too, could receive sacrifices. Accepting Li's arguments, Xuanzong immediately issued a decree adopting these changes (Ouyang 1975, 15:375). Although no early temple icons of Confucius survive today and documentary sources rarely mention them, some of their attributes can be inferred from his posthumous status. In 1 CE, the Han emperor Pingdi (r. 1 BCE-5 CE) honored Confucius by awarding him the rank of duke (gong &lt;?). From that time onward, various emperors conferred noble ranks and honorific titles on Confucius, his disciples, and the canonized later scholars who were periodically added to the temple (Wilson 1995, 23-71, 254-59).16 In 739, Tang Xuanzong elevated Confucius to King of Propagating Culture (Wenxuan wang ill) and gave the disciples and later followers various titles, such as duke, marquess (hou W), or earl (bo f?) (Ouyang 1975, 15:375-76). These posthumous ranks had considerable bearing on the visual features of the temple images. Sumptuary regulations specified the kinds of clothing, headgear, and ornamentation appro priate for each rank, as well as the number and kinds of vessels, music, and dancers to be used in sacrifices. As king, Confucius was to be portrayed wearing a robe embroidered with nine emblems and a crown with nine strings of jade beads hanging at the front and back (Kong Zhaoxi [1897] 1990, 8a [623]). Some later rulers sought to exalt Confucius beyond the rank of king, but min isterial opposition prevented them from doing so. For example, in 1008, the Song 14An important cache of early Buddhist images was recently found in Shandong not far from Qufu (Nikel 2002). Stanley K. Abe (2002, chap. 5) reproduces early Daoist votive images that also were inspired by Buddhist models. 15Kong Yuancuo excerpted this information from a stele inscription, dated 541 (Eastern Wei), by Li Ting ^ M (zi Zhongxuan or #$e), who restored the temple while serving as regional inspector of Yanzhou % &lt;&gt;H. Kong Yuqi ([1689] 1983, 7:la-8b [652-76-652-79]) transcribes more of the stele and describes the evolution of iconic representations in detail, in response to the questions posed by the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662-1722) during his 1684 visit to Qufu. 16Valerie Hansen (1990, chap. 4) discusses the principles involved in imperial awards of titles and honors to various gods during the Song period, when the practice was greatly expanded.</page><page sequence="9">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 379 emperor Zhenzong (r. 997-1022) wanted to confer the title of emperor (di iff) on Confucius. Senior officials were able to dissuade him by arguing that no such des ignation had existed during Confucius s lifetime (Zhang Tingyu et al. [1739] 1974, 50:1299). Left unstated but surely significant is the fact that scholar-officials would no longer be allowed to worship Confucius if he were promoted to emperor, because he would have to receive the highest level of state sacrifice, which only the ruler could offer (Wilson 2002c, 268). Although Zhenzong was unable to raise Confucius s posthumous rank, he added the words "Dark Sage" (Xuan sheng S IB) to the kingly title. The epithet alludes to apocryphal legends about Confucius s supernatural nature and powers, and in 1013, Zhen zong changed it to Ultimate Sage (Zhi sheng 3? M). A black-faced, ferocious looking sculptural icon preserved in the Confucian temple in Pingyao ^fiS, Shanxi, may reflect iconography specific to the "Dark Sage."18 Even without elevating Confucius s rank, some emperors conferred higher honors on him by enhancing his visual representation or aggrandizing his sacrifi cial ceremony. In 1009, Zhenzong ordered a jade scepter to replace the wooden tablet held by the sculptural effigy in the Qufu temple (Kong Chuan [1134] 1967, shang: 20a). A century later, the Song emperor Huizong (r. 1100-1125) had the nine strings of jade on the crown increased to twelve, and the Jin emperor Shizong (r. 1161-89) augmented the emblems on the robe from nine to twelve (Kong Zhaoxi [1897] 1990, 8b [624]).19 These changes in the icon s attributes visually upgraded the "uncrowned king" to an emperor. In the late fifteenth century, two Ming rulers also expanded the number of vessels and dancers in the semiannual sacrificial ceremonies to an imperial level, again without altering Confucius s kingly title.20 17Wilson (2002b, 47-48, 51-52) discusses legends about Confucius related to the term Xuan sheng and the possibility that it was changed because the character Xuan ? became taboo (as part of the personal name of an ancestor of the Song royal house). 18Partially reproduced and briefly discussed in Da zai Kongzi (1991, 333-34). Attributed to the Yuan period, the sculpture stands in a hall built during the Jin dynasty in 1163, but the condition of the icon suggests a much more recent date. Another black-faced statue of Confucius was reported by John Henry Gray, a late nineteenth-century Western visitor to the famous White Deer Grotto Academy (Bailudong shuyuan ? H &lt;r 1^) in Nanchang 1^ H, Jiangxi (Meskill 1982, 49, 176 n. 25). 19A contemporary account by a forty-seventh-generation descendant active at the time places Hui zong's edict requiring images to have twelve strings and nine emblems in 1107 (Kong Chuan [1134] 1967, shang: 27b-28a). According to the gazetteer Queli zhi (1505, 6:2b), which dates the change to 1105, images incorporating proper regalia were subsequently depicted, carved, and distributed to all the prefectural (zhou ill) and county (xian U) schools. Writing in the mid-eighteenth century, sixty-ninth-generation descendant Kong Jifen ([1762] 1966, 12:2a-b [211-212]) affirmed that the sculptural icon of Confucius had a crown with twelve strings of jade, a garment with the twelve emblems, a zhen gui jade tablet, and faced south (like an emperor), while the subsidiary figures had lesser emblems and faced east or west. 20In 1476, the Chenghua emperor (r. 1465-87) increased the vessels from ten to twelve, and the rows of dancers from six to eight; in 1496, the Hongzhi emperor (r. 1487-1505) raised the total number of dancers to seventy-two, making them "consistent with the procedures for a Son</page><page sequence="10">380 Julia K. Murray Convergence with Other Cult Images and Opposition to Icons Confucius was by no means the only recipient of imperial recognition. Emperors also bestowed noble ranks and titles on deities in the Daoist and popular-cult pantheons.21 Some of these figures gained imperial designations, and many others were kings. Accordingly, the highest-ranking Daoist and cult images were also portrayed with imperial regalia, such as the Jade Emperor depicted in figure 1. Although the icon of Confucius resembled these other emperors and kings, the visual similarities masked great differences in signifi cance and function. Ordinary men and women could worship Daoist, Buddhist, and popular-cult deities, seeking benefits for themselves and their families. By contrast, Confucius and his canonized followers were not efficacious gods who did things for individual supplicants, but conferred benefit to society at large; moreover, only a restricted male elite could perform the sacrifices.22 These cer emonies were intended to provide sustenance to the spirits of the men enshrined in the temple, as well as to enable participants to express their reverence for the entire canon of learning and ritual represented by Confucius, his disciples, later scholars, and statesmen. During the sacrifice, icons might help the celebrant visualize the spirits coming and accepting the offerings. A successful performance brought blessings to the entire realm. However, it was hard to prevent Confucian temple icons from triggering beliefs and expectations associated with representational images belonging to other religious contexts. The convergences in visual culture gave rise to beliefs that were not grounded in ancient sources, as well as to embellishments of Con fucius s life. One idea undoubtedly inspired by Buddhism is that Confucius was born with forty-nine unusual bodily features, echoing and outdoing the thirty-two marks that distinguished the Buddha S?kyamuni s body from those of ordinary mortals.23 Another is that Confuciuss spirit was constrained by the physical of Heaven" (ru tianzi zhi zhi ?n ^ ? U) (Zhang Tingyu et al. [1739] 1974, 50:1297-98; see also Standaert 2006, 84-85, 163 n. 38). 21Romeyn Taylor (1990) provides a useful overview of the late imperial form of the relationships among state sacrifices, institutional religions, and popular cults; Hansen (1990, chap. 4) discusses imperial awards of titles and honors to the various gods; and Liu Yang (2001) details the conflation of imperial imagery into Daoist iconography. 22Wilson (2002b, 44 n. 3) cites edicts of 1438 and 1836, outlawing statues of Confucius in Daoist and Buddhist temples, as evidence that he was occasionally worshiped by other social groups. By the late Qing, popular votive woodblock prints indicate that a godlike Confucius had developed some popular following; cf. figures 7 and 8. In the twentieth century, students in Japan as well as in China sought aid from Confucius for success on examinations. This practice has burgeoned on the mainland in recent years. 23See, e.g., Kong Chuan ([1134] 1967, xia: 3b) and Kong Yuancuo ([1242] 1967, 1:1); Kong Yuqi ([1689] 1983, 7:5b [652-78]) claims that a portrait made by Confucius s disciple Zi Gong recorded the forty-nine bodily marks.

Murray features of his sculptural icon. Once enlivened by a consecration ritual, a Buddhist image literally became the deity and could wield his powers (Kieschnick 2003, 56-63; Sharf 1996, 261-67). The gods of popular cults were also believed to inhabit their images (Hansen 1990, 53-54). The infiltration of such concepts and the danger that they would debase the cult of Confucius prompted Song and Ming Neo-Confucian ritualists to formulate objections to the presence of anthropomorphic images in the temple. The first signs of opposition to icons of Confucius in the state cult emerged as part of a larger argument against using images in sacrifices that had originated in antiquity (Ebrey 1991; Sommer 1993, 1994, 2002). Authoritative classical texts on ritual, most notably the Etiquette and Rites (Yi Ii ? /If) and Record of Rites, did not mention portraits in the procedures for making offerings to ancestral spirits, heavenly forces, or worthy men of ancient times. Major Song thinkers such as Cheng Yi g m (1033-1107) and Zhu Xi * &amp; (1130-1200), as well as ordinary officials, were eager to separate these kinds of rituals from the practices they associated with Buddhism, Daoism, and popular cults (Ebrey 1989, 301-2; Neskar 1996, 293-300). Zhu also argued explicitly against sacrificing to images of Confucius (Chan 1989, 400-401; Sommer 2002, 108). An additional concern was whether sculptures or paintings could ever provide a sufficiently faithful likeness of any deceased person for celebrants to experience the presence of his spirit and enter into communion with him (Sommer 2002). Classical texts indicated that in antiquity, a lineal descendant of the deceased played the role of "personator of the dead" (shi during the ceremony, using his blood connection and physical resemblance to evoke the departed ancestor. In order for a portrait to serve as an effective substitute, it had to be accurate, or else the offering would go astray. As Cheng Yi famously proclaimed, perhaps hyperbolically, a mistake in depicting even a single hair would cause the wrong spirit to come down to receive the sacrifice.24 Because images of Confucius were made so long after his lifetime, they could hardly be faithful representations, and no two looked exactly alike. The portrayals were invented by later artisans and not based on direct observation. The visual features of the sculptural icons of Confucius also contradicted the details of his life and displayed elements anachronistic to the material culture of his day. Not only were there no chairs in the late Eastern Zhou period, even the most reliably documented portraits showed him wearing the clothing of the Han and later physically distinctive predated Buddhism, but the specification of forty-nine marks reflects Bud dhist influence. The attribution of a larger number to Confucius implied that he was superior to the Buddha. 24Cheng Yi, Yi shu M m [Surviving Writings], 22A:7a; quoted by Deborah A. Sommer (2002, 113), who considers Cheng's statement a literal prescription for accurate ancestral portraits. I believe instead that he was making an extreme statement in order to emphasize his point that it was imposs ible for a fabricated image ever to be adequate for ritual use.</page><page sequence="13">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 383 periods (Queli zhi seventeenth-century ed., 1:6a; Kong Yuqi [1689] 1983, 7:lla-b [652-81]). And, of course, Confucius had never been a king, much less an emperor. Icons that represented him in the regalia appropriate to the honors that had been posthumously bestowed on him conflicted egregiously with well-known biographical details. Another line of argument reveals that even very sophisticated men subcon sciously equated the sculptural icons in the Confucian temple with the spirits that descended to receive sacrifice during the ceremony. In accord with classical ritual procedures, offerings of food and wine were placed on a mat on the ground. Because the icon of Confucius depicted a figure seated on a chair, both Zhu Xi and Song Na !fe ffa (1310-90) worried that his spirit would have to crawl to reach the nourishment (Sommer 2002, 106-7).25 Underlying this fear was their presumption that his spirit took on the properties of its anthropomorphic representation. The notion that Confuciuss spirit entered and became the seated figure reflects the influence of Buddhism. Although the sculptural images of Confucius were not supposed to be considered embodiments of the sage, but merely representations to help evoke his spirit, this distinction was blurred by their visual and material similarities to Buddhist icons. At the most fundamental level, however, Neo-Confucian ritualists were opposed to icons in the Confucian temple simply on principle: Classical texts did not prescribe a role for images in the performance of sacrificial rites. Even the authors of a treatise on the Qufu temple and its rituals acknowledged that icons had been incorporated only in recent centuries: "Setting up images to serve the spirits was not [done in] antiquity. It must postdate the end of the personator ritual" (Queli zhi 1505, 9:50a). Neo-Confucian ritual experts did not necessarily object to representations of Confucius in other contexts; Zhu Xi himself reportedly bowed daily to a sculptural portrait of Confucius, presumably an image kept in his home.26 Rather, they believed that the presence of anthro pomorphic images altered the character of the formal sacrifice, obstructing its evocation of the grandeur of the Way that Confucius had transmitted from the ancient sages. Indeed, Qiu Jun ?? j# (1421-95) argued that the object of the sacrifice was the Way itself, not the flesh-and-blood Confucius (Sommer 1993; Wilson 1996, 566). Figural icons threatened to reduce a profound spiritual encounter to a mundane, sensual experience that would have no transformative power. As Song Na observed, anthropomorphic images profaned the ineffable realm of invisible spirits and could not convey their virtues (Sommer 2002, 25This argument drew upon Su Shi's H (1036-1101) observation concerning sacrifices in general, that it was incongruous to place offerings on the floor for images over an altar. 26Sommer (2002,109), quoting Zhu Xis son-in-law Huang Gan # # (1151-1221). Zhu Xis ambiva lence about icons of Confucius comes out in a text for his White Deer Grotto Academy, quoted by Kong Yuqi ([1689] 1983, 7:5b [652-78]).</page><page sequence="14">384 Julia K. Murray 110-11). Because literati officials repeatedly revived the charge that the use of icons had come to China with Buddhism, the issue continued to rankle. Perhaps finding this view threatening to their special status, Kong writers care fully maintained accounts of the lineages various images of Confucius. In addition, Kong Yuqi ([1689] 1983, 7:5a-7b [652-78-652-79]) and Kong Jifen ([1762] 1966, 12:10b-lla [228-229]) presented forceful arguments in defense of icons, citing cases from the late Zhou to early Han in which representational images were created or used in sacrificial rituals, before the purported introduc tion of Buddhism in the reign of Han Mingdi (57-75). Stages in the Removal of Icons In 1382, the Ming founding emperor, Taizu (r. 1368-98), built a new Confucian temple for the imperial university in his capital at Nanjing. At the urging of his advisor, Song Lian 5? W (1310-81), he ordered that the temple be furnished not with portrait icons but only with wooden tablets inscribed with the names and titles of Confucius, his disciples, and later followers and scholars (Sommer 2002, 106).27 However, Taizu did not require other Confucian temples to get rid of their images, nor did he remove the posthumously conferred noble ranks and hon orific designations. By contrast, when he reformed another mid-level state cult, the worship of city gods (Cheng huang i$ S), Taizu abolished noble titles and anthro pomorphic representations from all city-god temples (Taylor 1990, 109-10). As personifications of natural forces, the city gods did not have well-established indi vidual identities.28 But Confucius and his followers had been men who walked the earth in historical times, and the desire for images of them remained strong. When the Yongle emperor (r. 1401-24) refurbished the Nanjing temple in 1410, he aban doned his father s principled aniconism and allowed representational images to be added. After he shifted the Ming capital to Beijing in the 1420s, he permitted the refurbishing of the icons in the imperial university's Confucian temple, which had been built under Mongol rule (Sommer 2002, 117-18). Starting in the middle Ming period, opponents of icons in the Confucian temple began to characterize them explicitly as a Buddhist influence. During the Tianshun era (1457-64), the Suzhou prefect Lin E # ?t (1423-76) refused to repair the dilapidated clay statues in the prefectural schools temple of Confu cius, stating, 27Song Lian had presented his recommendation in a 1371 memorial, "On the Confucian Temple" (Kongzi miaotang yiH^M^. ?), which is discussed by Huang Chin-hsing (2002, 276). Kong Yuqi ([1689] 1983, 7:6a-b [652-78]) strongly rebuts Songs arguments. 28Taylor (1990, 148-49) suggests that certain official-cult nature gods had developed personifica tions with a popular following, such as the God of Taishan M lU, whose local temples were run by Daoist priests.</page><page sequence="15">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 385 Clay images are not an ancient practice ... They are nothing but earth. How are they the sages and worthies? Confucius was born before Bud dhism entered China. Who knew of these so-called images then? (Gu [1658] 1963, 535; Taylor 1990, 141). Following the precedent set by Ming Taizu in the Nanjing Confucian temple, Lin installed inscribed wooden tablets instead. A few years later, Qiu Jun appealed to anti-Mongol sentiment in his polemic against icons in the Confucian temple at the Beijing imperial university (Sommer 1993; 2002, 118-25). He claimed not only that Buddhist influence had interp olated images into classical rituals but also that Mongol patronage during the Yuan dynasty had caused alien religious practices to become entrenched. To Qiu, the presence of icons in the Confucian temple signified a foreign debase ment of the native practice, which was to use a tablet to represent the recipient of a sacrifice. However, Qiu did not press to remove images from temples associ ated with schools at the lower levels of government. His main concern was with the temple in the capital, where the emperor himself sometimes performed the sacrifice (Sommer 2002, 123). As Sommer has pointed out (2002, 123-24), Qiu Jun evidently attributed a form of embodiment and agency to anthropomorphic representations that he did not associate with inscribed tablets. He believed that it violated protocol for the emperor to bow before sculptural images of Confucius and his followers because these men had all been of lower ranks. However, Qiu did not object to the emperor s veneration of tablets inscribed with the names of those same com moners. Although Qiu disparaged sculptural icons as inanimate and worthless objects of clay, arbitrarily fashioned by artisans, he must have sensed that such images made their referents present more effectively than inscribed tablets did. If only at an unconscious level, Qiu equated the icons with the men they rep resented, which suggests that even an arch foe of Buddhism could not avoid being influenced by the Buddhist idea that the image embodied the deity. Accordingly, Qiu was less concerned about removing icons from prefectural and county temples because only ordinary officials and scholars sacrificed there; the emperor did not. Although Qiu Jun s arguments went nowhere during his lifetime, they were revived and finally adopted in 1530, when the Jiajing emperor (r. 1522-66) issued a decree requiring that images be removed from all Confucian temples, which henceforth were to display only the inscribed tablets. At the same time, the emperor abolished the noble titles held by Confucius, his disciples, and later fol lowers, replacing them with designations that shifted emphasis to the teaching and transmission of the Way. Confucius was now titled Ultimate Sage and First Teacher (Zhisheng xianshi 3? ffi 3feSP), and the others were variously Correlates, Savants (Zhe ), Former Worthies (Xian xian % R), and Former Scholars (Xian ru 5fe M). Even if a few state temples dodged the order to destroy their images</page><page sequence="16">386 Julia K. Murray by constructing a false wall in front of them, the shift to reliance solely on inscribed wooden tablets was remarkably thorough.29 At the same time, the number of vessels was reduced from twelve to ten, and the rows of dancers from eight to six (Zhang Tingyu et al. [1739] 1974, 50:1298). Huang Chin-hsing (2002) has argued that the Jiajing emperor used the issue of appropriate rites for Confucius as an opportunity to consolidate his dominance over capital officials, who had opposed his desire to incorporate his natural parents into the rituals venerating his imperial ancestors. The Survival and Renewal of the Qufu Temple Icon Significantly, the imperial order to remove icons made an exception for the temple of Confucius in his hometown of Qufu (Kong Yuqi [1689] 1983, 7:7b [652-79]). This temple not only participated in the state cult but also was associ ated with Confuciuss flesh-and-blood descendants (Wilson 1996, 2002b), and ritualists had come to accept the use of portraits in familial worship (Stuart and Rawski 2001, 35-49). Nonetheless, government officials performed semi annual sacrifices at the Qufu temple, which also enshrined more than 150 men unrelated to the Kongs. The main sacrificial hall (Dacheng dian fz j$ Jg?) displayed sculptural images of Confucius, the Four Correlates, and the Ten Savants, while the Former Worthies and Former Scholars were depicted in paintings in the two long corridors along the east and west sides of the forecourt. The icon of Confu cius continued to display imperial attributes, despite the apparent contradiction with his changed title, perhaps to ensure that visually, at least, he outranked his ennobled descendants. Since 739, the most senior Kong in each generation had been a duke, initially titled Duke of Propagating Culture (Wenxuan gong X S ?), and after 1055, Duke of Perpetuating the Sage (Yansheng gong fi? fi (Wilson 2002b, 63, 67). Whatever the reason, the Qufu image preserved the visual similarity between Confucius and the high gods of the Daoist and popular pantheons. The continued presence of icons after 1530 made the Qufu temple unique, even though the temple at the imperial university in Beijing was ritually more important because the emperor regularly sacrificed there.30 Post-1530 editions of the Qufu temple gazetteer, Queli zhi SS ? IS, called attention to this new 29Sommer (2002, 126-27) quotes a widely repeated assertion by Gu Yanwu Jg ? ft (1613-82) that some temples hid their images after 1530 rather than demolishing them. John Meskill (1982, 49) suggests that private academies might have kept images. The Japanese Confucian scholar Hayashi Razan # fi ih (1583-1657) installed icons of Confucius and the Four Correlates in his academy's temple in 1632; and sculptural icons of Confucius and Ten Savants were displayed in the Yushima Seid? ? So H % the Tokugawa shoguns' temple in Edo, founded in 1690 and depicted in a contemporary painting (Yushima Seid? to Edojidai 1990, cat. B7). 30On very rare occasions, an emperor journeyed to Qufu to offer sacrifice, usually in conjunction with a visit to Taishan to perform the even more important feng ?f and shan ffm sacrifices; but</page><page sequence="17">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 387 Figure 2.

Solemn in expression, he holds a pointed tablet in front of none of the Ming emperors made the effort. By contrast, most of them managed to make the short excursion to the Confucian temple at the imperial university at least once during their reigns. 31The line drawing of the icon, which does not record the size, medium, or color, appears in Kong Zhencongs ?L M H twehe-juan edition of Queli zhi, completed in 1599 and printed in 1609, and in Kong Yinzhis ?L ML fit (1592-1647) mid-seventeenth-century edition in twenty-four juan. Although these later editions preserved core material from the original 1505 compilation by the high official Chen Gao, the Kong lineage s vested interest in the Qufu temple is evident from the fact that the compilers of later editions were eminent Kong clansmen; Kong Yinzhi was the sixty-fifth-generation's Duke of Perpetuating the Sage.</page><page sequence="18">388 Julia K. Murray his chest. His robe displays imperial emblems, such as the sun, moon, and Big Dipper on the shoulders, and dragons and mountains on the voluminous sleeves. Twelve strings of beads hang from both ends of his mortarboard-shaped crown, which is foreshortened so that the back is not visible. Except for the inscribed title that identifies the figure as Confucius, the image could easily be taken for one of the high gods of religious Daoism (cf. figure 1). In 1724, a fire in the Qufu temple devastated the main hall and destroyed the sculptural icons. To assist with the repairs, the Yongzheng emperor (r. 1723-35) sent a team of palace artisans to create replacements for the images of Confucius and the Four Correlates, which were completed in 1730 (Kong Jifen [1762] 1966, 12:10a-b [222-228]; Xichao xinyu [1824] 1984, 9:1b [366]). The similarity between figures 2 and 3, as well as a late Ming description (Bi Ziyan 1983, 3:26a [1293-447]), suggest that the 1730 replacements faithfully preserved icono graphic details. The illustration in Quell zhi (i.e., figure 2) probably served as the specific model for the replacement (figure 3). Rather than simply modeling clay figures over a wooden armature, the sculptors used the "unsupported method" (tuo tax ja $l flp i?, literally "discarded-embryo technique"), which created a hollow space inside the sculptures.32 Silver "organs," bronze mirrors, and old edi tions of the Confucian classic books were placed there, suggesting yet another way in which Confucian icons were affected by Buddhist practices. Such deposits were often placed inside an interior cavity of a Buddhist sculptural image to help empower the image or make offerings to the deity (Kieschnick 2003, 62-63; Shen 2000). Qufu temple documents do not mention the concealed objects, and it is unclear whether the previous set of icons had also contained them. The hidden deposits briefly came to light only in November 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, when Red Guards smashed the Qing sculptures and discovered the objects inside. Unfortunately, the deposited objects were almost immediately destroyed (Wang Liang 2002, 391; Yazi 1991, 138-39, 168). Woodblock Prints and the Popularization of Confucius Although the Jiajing emperor intended his 1530 reform to put an end to inap propriately godlike representations of Confucius, the continued existence of the sculptural icon in the Qufu temple prevented this iconography from disappear ing. Coinciding with the sixteenth-century boom in woodblock printing and book publishing, the ban on representational images in all other Confucian 32The translation of tuo taifa (literally, "embryo-removal technique") as "unsupported method" was suggested by an anonymous reviewer for the JAS. The technique was used most often to make hollow dry-lacquer images, in which raw lacquer is applied to a cloth over an unfired clay model of the desired figure; after the lacquer has dried and hardened, the clay is chipped out. The term could also be used to describe a technique for modeling an image in clay and removing some of the interior material when the form has dried.</page><page sequence="19">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 389 Figure 3.

As I discuss in the next section, Kong family publications since the twelfth century had recorded a small painting of Confucius and his disciple Yan Hui as the most faith ful (zui zhen ft M) depiction of the master (Kong Chuan [1134] 1967, xia: 3b-4a; Kong Jifen [1762] 1966, 12:3a [213]; Murray, forthcoming). The illustration of the Qufu temple icon differed significantly from the other pictures in Shengxian xiangzan. L? Weiqi s original compendium reproduced a famous set of stone tablets made in 1156 for the Southern Song imperial univer sity, which later became the Hangzhou prefectural school.35 Unlike the Qufu sculpture, the incised tablets portrayed Confucius seated in three-quarter profile on a low dais and dressed in unadorned robes (figure 6). Gesturing with one hand and holding a long, curved scepter with the other, he appears to be addressing the seventy-two disciples, who are arrayed before him in a long line of lively figures. The Hangzhou tablets were not used in temple sacrifices but were displayed in the school building to inspire the students to cultivate virtue 33The name Hall of the Three Rarities (Sanxi tang H # ^) appears in the lower margin (banxin 'fr) throughout this edition, perhaps indicating that it was published by the Qing palace in Beijing. A hall of that name was the private studio of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1735-96). Then ? in zhenrong M ^ may sometimes mean "ideal" or "perfect" rather than "realistic" in a literal sense (Zeitlin 2005, 406 n. 30). 34The title page of the 1878 edition of Shengxian xiangzan has a notation stating that the blocks were stored in the Gathered Culture Hall (Huiwen tang in Qufu. 35Huang Yongquan (1963) and Beijing tushuguan cang huaxiang taben huibian (1993, 1:8-76) reproduce rubbings of the extant tablets; I have analyzed their creation and transmission (Murray 1992). Originally commissioned by the Song emperor Gaozong in 1156, the incised tablets reproduced eulogies (zan 3t) personally composed by that emperor and idealized portraits by an unnamed court artist (or artists) for all seventy-three figures. By the mid-fifteenth century, the images had gained an attribution to a famous literati painter, Li Gonglin ^ ?i (c. 1049-1106). L? Weiqi used other sources for images of the many later men who had been added to the temple cult after 1156 and composed eulogies for them himself. The most recent figure in the compendium is Wang Yangming ? m W (1472-1529; jinshi 1499), who entered the temple in 1584. 36Although the depiction of Confucius in the Hangzhou tablets superficially resembles images of the learned Buddhist layman Vimalaklrti in his debate with the bodhisattva Manjusrl, the two figures differ significantly in posture. Confucius sits on the soles of his feet, with both legs folded beneath him, while Vimalaklrti was frequently portrayed sitting cross-legged, sometimes with one knee up, and displaying his feet (e.g., Barnhart et al. 1997, 73 fig. 67). According to Zhu Xi, the cross-legged posture was a Buddhist innovation that went against ancient decorum, which was represented by Confuciuss way of sitting (Kong Yuqi [1689] 1983, 7:5a-b [652-78]). In fact, a more likely inspiration for the Hangzhou portrayal was the long-lost stone image of Con fucius to which Zhu Xi referred, which many believed had been installed by Wen Weng m (fl. second century BCE) in his academy at Chengdu $c U. J. Michael Farmer (2000) deconstructs this and other widespread myths about Wen.</page><page sequence="23">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 393 Figure 6.

Weiqi prefaced his Shengxian xiangzan by stating that scholars of his own day needed images to remind them of fundamental values and prevent them from straying into Buddhism, Daoism, and even Christianity (L? 1632, xu: 3b 4b). The animated and engaging figures contrast sharply with the static pose and hieratic frontality of the Qufu temple icon, which suggests a conception of Confucius as remote and eternal, consistent with its ritual function.37 37The portrayal of Confucius with his seventy-two disciples focuses attention on his teaching and its transmission, and these images may be compared with the incised tablets illustrating his life and</page><page sequence="24">394 Julia K. Murray Before photographs of the Qufu temple s sculptural icon of Confucius made it widely known in the twentieth century (e.g., figure 3), woodblock-printed images were the primary means of spreading knowledge of it (e.g., figures 2 and 5). The hieratic frontality and clearly depicted emblems of rank and potency marked Confucius as a god comparable to the Jade Emperor (figure 1), which undoubtedly helped stimulate interest in worshiping him. Moreover, late nineteenth-century efforts to popularize his cult encouraged ordinary people to incorporate Confucius into the heterogeneous pantheon of efficacious deities (Chen 1999; Clart 2003). Although Confucius never became as important in this respect as Buddhist, Daoist, and popular-cult gods, votive prints from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries suggest that people did worship him in homes and village schools (Kongzi baitu 1997,12). Some of these prints, called "New Year pictures" (nian hua ^ It), were pasted above altars and on walls at the beginning of each year, providing a focus for veneration and offerings of incense throughout the year. Others, sometimes called "paper horses" (zhi ma IS ??), were intended for use in a single worship ritual and were burned immediately after ward, to send them to the spirit world.38 Surviving examples show that Confucius was sometimes the primary object of worship, while others include him as just one of many deities in a "pantheon" print. The first of two popular prints reproduced here, made for one-time use, depicts Confucius with imperial attributes (figure 7) and is clearly based on the Qufu temple icon. However, the image has been vernacularized with conventions of the popular-print genre and closely resembles votive images of Daoist and popular gods (see, e.g., Po 1992; Rudova 1988; Wang Shucun 1992). The powerful features of Confucius s outsize face convey crude vigor, not decorous serenity, rendering him remarkably similar to Lord Guan (Guan di M (Po 1992, nos. 21-22; Rudova 1988, nos. 6, 22) or even to the deified Ox King (Niu wang 4^ ^) (Po 1992, no. 28; Wang Shucun 1992, 21 pi. 6). Smaller standing figures of the Four Correlates flank the seated Confucius in the same way that other popular prints portray a gods assistants, visually attesting his importance and power. Although iconic sculptures repre senting the Four Correlates accompany the statue of Confucius in the Qufu temple, and all are reproduced as line drawings in Shengxian xiangzan, this book presents each figure in isolation. The popular print not only casts the Four Correlates as Confuciuss assistants, it also gives each of the five men a halo, a motif originally introduced from Buddhist visual iconography and more deeds that were carved in 1592 for display in the Hall of the Sage s Traces (Shengji dian ? gft J$), behind the Qufu temples sacrificial hall (Murray 1996). In 1991, incised copies of the Hangzhou tablets were added, installed in the wall of a courtyard east of the main axis. 38Po Sung-nien (1992) provides an accessible introduction to the iconography and use of popular prints; James A. Flath (2003) offers a more comprehensive and contextually rigorous discussion.</page><page sequence="25">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 395 Figure 7.

Confucius 39Similarly, interior settings and the paraphernalia of sacrifice sometimes appear in portrait paint ings of recently deceased persons that were intended for use in memorial rituals (e.g., Stuart and Rawski 2001, pis. 1.8, 2.6, 2.9, 4.10).</page><page sequence="27">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 397 wears a simplified version of the imperial regalia and has a red face, as other gods sometimes do. The books on the altar refer not to temple rituals but to Confucius s identification with learning. At the center of the roof ridge is a vase sprouting lances and an inverted V-shaped chime, a common rebus for "a lifetime of blessings" (ping shengji qing T ? Ii) (Po 1992, 160). New Year prints typically incorporate such auspicious designs and symbolic decorations as a means of attracting good fortune and worldly success. Taken together, these features suggest that the print was mar keted to people who aspired to ascend socially through educational accomplishment and were accustomed to seeking aid from the gods to fulfill their needs. The print visually represents Confucius as an appropriate god to petition for assistance with schooling and examinations. Such expectations are confirmed by the four-character title above his head, "Ultimate Sage and Ancestral Teacher" (Zhisheng zongshi 3? Utk W). This designation suggests the reverential conception of Confucius as the progeni tor of a lineage of scholars,40 and may also allude to his role as the purported founder of a national religion of Confucianism, which Kang Youwei and others were attempt ing to establish from 1898 through the 1910s (Chen 1999; Goossaert 2006). An Alternative Icon: The Traveling Pedagogue Another effect of the Jiajing emperor s 1530 removal of icons from state temples and change of Confucius s honorific tide was to give a more prominent role to depic tions that represented Confucius as a man rather than as a god. In addition to more numerous and varied versions of his pictorial biography, often called Shengji tu M it H (Murray 2002, 255-57), the period after 1530 saw a proliferation of portraits of Confucius as a teacher.41 These images show him wearing a simple cloth cap and undecorated robes, with a sword tucked under his left arm (figure 9). Slightly stooped, he stands in a dignified posture with hands clasped in front of his chest. Some renditions give his face a distinctly homely appearance, even buck teeth, while others replace the simple cloth headgear with a cap shaped like a lotus bud, or even an official cap. In the late Ming and Qing periods, this image was incised on stone tablets for display in school buildings, and it was also reproduced in woodblock-printed books and hanging scroll paintings 42 Differing only slightly from one another, these renditions often include a notation attributing the original 40For example, the group of late Ming officials and literati who sponsored the construction of the Hall of the Sage's Traces in the Qufu temple referred to themselves as "the sixtieth generation of the Sages disciples" (Shengmen liushi chuan a + ff) (Murray 1996, 278). 41I reproduce and discuss several depictions of Confucius as a traveling teacher (Murray 2001) and analyze the origins and evolution of this iconography (Murray, forthcoming); Luo Chenglie (2003) illustrates many examples and provides dimensions for those in Qufu. Some of the images bear large-character titles, such as Xingjiao tu fx i?

(c. 689-after 755), the most renowned figure painter of the eighth century. However, Wu s early biographies and lists of paintings do not mention any portrait of Confucius. Although the earliest references date only from the late eleventh century (Murray, forthcoming), Wu could conceivably have been inspired to paint an image of Confucius while serving in office in Xiaqiu, Yanzhou % #1JR a short distance from Qufu (Zhang Yanyuan [847] 1963, vol. 1, 9:108-9). Confucius s three-quarter stance and costume in this portrayal closely resemble those of another picture, in which he is accompanied by his favorite disciple, Yan Hui (figure 10).43 First documented in the late eleventh century, the two-man compo sition reproduced a small painting in the Kong family ancestral temple (jia miao gazetteers and epigraphical compendia preserve inscriptions for numerous stones that no longer survive. I discuss some of these and other examples (Murray, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="30">400 Julia K. Murray which was adjacent to but separate from the official temple of Confucius in Qufu. Recorded in successive Kong genealogies (e.g., KongChuan [1134] 1967, xia: 3b-4a; Kong Yuancuo [1242] 1967, 8:4b), the heirloom painting allegedly trans mitted Confucius s true likeness more faithfully than other portraits, and it was repeatedly copied in stone stelae and woodblock-printed books from the late ele venth century onward (Murray, forthcoming). The solo portrait was probably created by enlarging the figure of Confucius from this two-man composition. In the early Southern Song period (1127-1279), prominent Kongs from Qufu erected a stele depicting just Confucius in Quzhou flSf )M, Zhejiang, where they settled after fleeing the Jin invasions of the north in 1126-27.44 In the following cen turies, the solo portrait was repeatedly recarved onto new stones, particularly at gov ernment schools and private academies in the South. Several early examples have inscriptions referring to a stone incised with the "Wu Daozi" image of Confucius that was miraculously found in 1322 inside a bridge near Jiangling rX ?, Hubei, and subsequently put on display there (Kongzi baitu 1997, 107; Zhongguo meishu quanji, huihua bian 1988,19 no. 70). The apparent preference for the solo portrait in the South and its association with the Southern Kongs contrast with the northern affiliations of the two-man composition, which was reproduced on stelae in the Qufu temple and elsewhere under the Jin dynasty (Murray, forthcoming). Compet ing with the Southern Song for the allegiance of the Kongs and of learned men in general, the Jin patronized the temple and awarded the ducal title to Kong Duanyous younger brother, who had remained behind in Qufu (Wilson 1996, 571-72). Although incised tablets depicting Confucius as a simply dressed standing figure were widespread before 1530, this image gained importance after the Jiajing emperor abolished icons from Confucian temples. The representation accorded well with Confucius's new official designation as Ultimate Sage and First Teacher, and the composition readily circulated in rubbings, from which additional tablets could be carved. Normally displayed in school buildings rather than in sacrificial halls, it played no role in the formal rituals performed twice a year. Instead, the portrayal was commemorative and inspirational, offer ing latter-day students and teachers visual rapport with their role model and 43The painting of Confucius and Yan Hui is first mentioned in a now-lost genealogy published in 1085 by Kong Zonghan ?L m ft (eleventh century), quoted by Kong Chuan ?L ft ([1134] 1967, xia: 3b-4a); Kong Yuancuo ([1242] 1967, shou) reproduces the composition in a line drawing. Records by writers outside the Kong lineage associate Wu Daozi with the two-man depiction, as well as with the solo portrait (Murray, forthcoming). 44The Ming recarving of the stele (figure 9) bears an inscription stating that the original was erected by Kong Duanyou ?L 3f? tc (d. 1132) and Kong Chuan (ca. 1059-ca. 1134) (Qufu Kongmiao jianzhu 1988, 3 fig. 1-1-2 caption; Luo 2003, 24). Kong Duanyou was the forty-eighth-generations Duke of Perpetuating the Sage; Kong Chuan was a forty-seventh- generation descendant and genealogist who brought precious documents to the South. The Southern Song emperor Gaozong sought the allegiance of refugee Kongs and gave them official positions, courtesy titles, and a base in Quzhou, where they could resume caring for their ancestor's spirit.</page><page sequence="31">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 401 allowing them to imagine themselves as the latest generation of Confucius s dis ciples. In the Qing period, three stelae carved with versions of the solo portrait of Confucius were added to the Qufu temples Hall of the Sages Traces (Shengji dian M ft JK), joining a 112-scene pictorial hagiography displayed on stone tablets there since 1592-93 (Murray 1996). Modified versions of Confucius s por trayal as a teacher also appeared in European publications of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Dematte 2007, 37-38; Jensen 1997, 10, 82). After the Qing dynasty was overthrown and replaced by the Republican gov ernment, the basis for the official cult of Confucius became much more tenuous (Wilson 2002b, 85-87).45 Although some prominent intellectuals advocated making Confucianism a national religion modeled on Christianity, others worked strenuously to redefine it as a nonreligious cultural tradition (Goossaert 2006, 15). As First Teacher, Confucius became a symbol of respect for learning and an emblem of classical civilization. This conception also found resonance with the Japanese, who increasingly saw themselves as heirs to the ancient cultural legacy (Fogel 1995, chap. 6) 46 In 1935, a small Ming bronze image of the standing Confucius was installed in the Yushima Seid? IIIS, the Confucian temple in Tokyo, which had been rebuilt with sturdy modern materials after the 1923 earthquake (Yushima Seid? to Edojidai 1990, nemp?, Bl). When Confucius was repudiated by Communist authorities in the People s Republic after 1949, the Nationalist government in Taiwan promoted him as an emblem of its commitment to preserve Chinas ancient heritage. In 1974, at the height of the "Criticize Lin Biao, Criticize Confucius" (pi Lin pi Kong jft # ftt ?L) movement on the mainland, the Taiwan government officially sponsored and disseminated a carefully chosen portrayal of Confucius (Cai 1976, 115; Murray 2001, 17, 26). Deeming his identity as a teacher most significant for Chinese and world culture, the Ministry of Education designated a purported "Wu Daozi" image to serve as the official portrait of Confucius (figure 11). Based on a rubbing from a Qing stele in Qufu, the depiction gave Confucius an appropriately dignified yet humane appearance. Moreover, the choice was validated by Kong Decheng ?Lfit $c (1920-2008), the senior Kong in the seventy seventh generation, who had lived in Qufu before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949. Over-life-size bronze statues using this iconography were cast in Taiwan and pre sented in 1974-75 to sites of culture and learning around the world, including the Yushima Seid? (figure 12). 450fficial sacrifices briefly stopped with the fall of the Qing but were revived by President Yuan Shikai feiftfl (1859-1916) in 1914, although their observance declined after his failed attempt to found a new dynasty. In 1935, the Nationalist government withdrew the ducal title from Confucius s descendants (Jing 1996, 39). 46This attitude also encouraged the Japanese to mount extensive photographic, archaeological, and epigraphical surveys of Chinas ancient monuments and sites, including detailed investigations of Qufu in the first several decades of the twentieth century, as well as stimulating Sinological studies and compilations of Chinese texts.</page><page sequence="32">402 Julia K.

Portrait of Confucius, tradition ally attributed to Tang master Wu Daozi ? il (ca. 689-after 755), rubbing of a Qing-period incised stone tablet in the Temple of Confucius, Qufu, Shandong. Source: Baba (1940, 40). More recently, mainland China has turned away from iconoclasm, and rep resentations of Confucius are proliferating once more. The smashed icons in the Qufu temple were reconstructed in 1984, and Hong Kong and overseas Chinese donors have erected large statues of the ancient teacher at many schools and at former Confucian temples that have been restored as tourist attractions (see cover photo in this issue). In 1999, the government-supported China Confucius Foundation issued a limited edition of 1,000 gold statuettes of Confucius to honor the 2,500th anniversary of his birth (figure 13). Pro motional literature claimed that the statue was based on the most faithful tra ditional portrait, the "Wu Daozi" image, but was even more authentic. Instead of imitating the anachronistic clothing inadvertently depicted by Wu, the robes of the new image reflected archaeological evidence from the Warring States period. This concern for period-appropriate costume perfectly captures the</page><page sequence="33">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 403 Figure 12.

Since 2004, China has used Confucius to promote the study of Chinese language and culture worldwide under the rubric of "Confucius Institutes" and has even contributed funds to establish a "Confucius Literacy Prize" awarded by UNESCO (China View 2006). In order to make Confucius a more recogniz able and effective symbol of Chinese civilization, the China Confucius Foun dation pushed to standardize his visual representation and put an end to the diverse portrayals, some of which purportedly even "deified and defamed" (shenhua he chouhua fn Ms) him (Zhongguo xinwen wang 2006). Thus, in January 2006, plans were announced to create a standard portrait, starting with yet another review of existing images in consultation with scholars of Confucianism, historians, sculptors and painters, and descendants of Confucius.</page><page sequence="34">404 Julia K. Murray Figure 13. Statuette of Confucius, 1999, designed for the China Confucius Foundation by Qian Shaowu m W&gt; ? (b. 1928), 24-carat gold, height 27 cm. Source: China Confucius Foundation publicity pamph let, 2001. Design specifications issued in February called for the new portrait to be based on the purported Wu Daozi image and to depict Confucius as between sixty and seventy years of age, with a facial expression that was at once "genial yet strict, imposing and yet not intimidating, courteous and yet at ease" (wen er Ii, wei er bu meng, gong er an fiffffiS, ?rffi^Ffi:, ?SMS) (Dahe xinxiang wang 2006, quoting Analects 7.38, trans. Dawson 1993, 27). A prototype was presented at the Shandong International Cultural Industry Exposition in June 2006, and the final version was unveiled in Qufu on September 23, in time for birthday celebra tions (China View 2006) (figure 14). Inevitably, this effort to standardize the por trayal of Confucius prompted criticisms (CRIEnglish.com 2006), some of which recall the kinds of objections raised against his icons in earlier periods. Obviously, it is impossible to know what Confucius "really" looked like so long after his life time, and even the so-called Wu Daozi portrait came from the artists</page><page sequence="35">"Idols" in the Temple: Icons and the Cult of Confucius 405 Figure 14.

Moreover, an emphasis on Confucius s outward appearance seems wrong and completely unnecessary to people who focus on his teachings and the values associated with him. The variety of visual representations reflects the ways in which Confucius has been understood and appropriated throughout history. As scholars debated in 2006 whether it was possible or desirable to decree any portrayal as correct, one new argument captured a contemporary concern: that creating a "standard" is the first step toward patenting the image for com mercial profit (China Daily 2006). In response, Secretary-General Zhang Shuhua &amp; Mi # of the China Confucius Foundation reiterated that a unified stan dard was intended only to end the confusion caused by multiple images and to facilitate worldwide recognition of Confucius; in fact, it did not really matter whether the portrait resembled Confucius (CRIEnglish.com 2006). However, Zhang also mentioned that Taiwan had previously issued its own standard</page><page sequence="36">406 Julia K. Murray image of Confucius, implying that the real "confusion" has to do with which regime controls his legacy. Thus, the 2006 "branding" of Confucius was not pri marily for commercial motives but for political ones. Establishing an official por trait of Confucius is an assertion of authority over the heritage of Chinese civilization.
