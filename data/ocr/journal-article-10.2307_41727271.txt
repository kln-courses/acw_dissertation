The Bronze Age Hoards of Denmark by Janet E.Levy The tasks. archaeologist's study How, of prehistoric after most all, fascinating, can religion is one yet beliefs, elusive of an archaeologist's most fascinating, yet elusive tasks. How, after all, can prayers, beliefs, values, and symbols - the basic stuff of religion - be dug up? The reconstruction of food-getting or man- ufacturing activities, in contrast, is far easier because of the relative prevalence of material re- mains. But a comprehensive understanding of a soci- ety is impossible without studying its religion. Ar- chaeologists with an anthropological background are particularly concerned with how religion relates to past economies and social and political organiza- tions. One prehistoric religious system - Denmark dining the Bronze Age (ca. 1800-500 b.c.) - is par- ticularly interesting, because it demonstrates how a religious system was related to a hierarchical social system. Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age Danish society was based on a mixed farming and herding economy. The Danes were also highly skilled metallurgists and carpenters, and had exten- sive foreign contacts, especially with central Europe. Raw metal and occasional manufactured bronze ob- jects, such as swords, cups, and jewelry, were pro- cured from central Europe through formal trade, and probably marriage exchanges and gift-giving as well. What the Danes gave in exchange for this metal is not clear from the archaeological record, but their exports may have included amber, timber, grain and furs. Much of the raw metal was manufactured into tools, weapons and jewelry in Denmark. These were used in daily life and many eventually found their way into burials as grave goods. Archaeologists believe that Danish society at that time was a non-egalitarian one, including an elite class who strongly influenced trade, political organization and religion. Typically, the political leader was also a religious leader or high priest. Some evidence of Danish religious activity comes from burials in earthen mounds, many of which can still be seen across the landscape. In the Early Bronze Age (ca. 1800-1100 b.c.) people were usually buried extended on their backs in a wooden coffin and accompanied by many metal, wood and cloth January/Februaiy 1982 37</page><page sequence="2">grave goods. Some graves contained a wealth of bronze and gold in the form of swords, daggers, belt fasteners, armbands, neckrings and other jewelry, as well as objects such as wooden cups, boxes and stools. Other graves were poor and contained nothing but a bronze pin, or no grave goods at all. This varia- tion in burial wealth is one hint that the society was a ranked, non-egalitarian one. In contrast, in archae- ological examples from egalitarian tribal societies, the grave goods are quite similar from individual to individual. In later times - the Late Bronze Age (1100-500 b.c.) - cremation was common and the ashes were often placed in a pottery urn. Grave goods were few and small and included such items as bronze pins, buttons and razors. It is not at all clear why burial practice changed from the Early Bronze Age to the Late Bronze Age in Denmark. A similar change oc- curred in much of Europe around this time. Some have suggested that the shift is related to changes in ideas about the soul and afterlife, but this hypothesis is extremely difficult to study. In any case, the wealth that went into the graves in the Early Bronze Age was redirected during the Late Bronze Age into another set of finds. Archaeologists are uncovering new information about both prehistoric religion and social class from these buried collections of bronze and occasional gold objects. About 350 such hoards - as archaeologists call them - date from the Bronze Age in Denmark, most from Funen, Zealand, especially near the coast, and from central and northern Jutland. They most commonly consist of tools, swords and spearpoints, neckrings, armbands, brooches (called fibulae) and various belt ornaments. Buckets, cups, bridle bits and ornaments for horses, and shields were also sometimes included. Workmanship is Ã©xcellent. Many are decorated with engraved spirals and wave- like motifs, arrangements of parallel lines and cross- hatching, and anthropomorphic motifs such as snake or dragon-like figures. These hoards are not associated with either burials or habitation sites. They were commonly placed near water, although some have been found on dry land. Fortunately for archaeologists, these wet locations have preserved the bronzes excellently and have given them a gold or green-gold patina which enhances their striking appearance. The rest- ing places of the hoards also provide a hint about their actual function, which has become one focus of today's research. Many of the hoards seem to be religious offerings of some kind, perhaps dedicated to spirits who lived in lakes or springs. T he first use of the hoards in archaeology was for dating purposes. In the late nineteenth century, a relative chronology of the Bronze Age in southern Scandinavia was established based on the hoards discovered to date. By analyzing the variation in form and decoration of the bronze objects from graves and hoards, Oscar Montelius, the distinguished Swedish archaeologist, divided the Scandinavian Bronze Age into six periods from 1800 b.c. to 600 b.c. Today this chronology, with refinements and the ad- dition of absolute dates from crossties to the literate cultures of the Mediterranean, is the basis for dating Scandinavian Bronze Age material. Some of the hoards, especially but not exclusively those found in dry land, probably were made when wealth was hidden in times of trouble, or by an itiner- ant bronze worker caching his supplies. But a magor portion appears to be the remains of sacred offerings. One insight into the nature of the latter hoards comes to us indirectly. The second-century Roman historian Tacitus, writing about the Germanic peo- ples some 600 years after the end of the Bronze Age, describes a religious ritual in which sacrifices, in- cluding human ones, are offered to a powerful god- dess in a lake. "On an island of the sea stands an inviolate grove, in which, veiled with a cloth, is a chariot, that none but the priest may touch. The priest can feel the presence of the goddess in this holy of holies and attends her with deepest reverence as her chariot is drawn along by cows . . . the chariot, the vestments, and (believe it if you will) the goddess herself are cleansed in a secluded lake. This service is performed by slaves who are immediately after- wards drowned in the lake." (Germania, Chapter 40). Written sources document a continuing ritual in- terest in holy lakes, wells and springs throughout the Mediaeval period in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and later in Denmark. Indeed, there are records from as late as 1927 of offerings made at St. Helen's Spring on the island of Zealand, north of Copenhagen. Going back in time also pro- vides clues about this interest in holy springs even before the Bronze Age. Many archaeological finds from the preceding Neolithic period (ca. 4500-2000 b.c.) include beautifully polished stone axes depos- ited in lakes or bogs along with pottery vessels which probably contained food offerings.

How does this practice relate to prehis- toric life in general? After all, the hoards may pro- vide valuable information about craft production, trade and social stratification, as well as about religion. Most of the hoards, from the Early as well as the Late Bronze Age, contain objects which, judging from worn spots, were used before they were deposited. This means that these items were not made just for a religious ceremony; they were used in daily life be- fore being placed in the ground. Jewelry and weapons, however, were not used merely for decora- tion or personal protection. They were status sym- bols, or what anthropologists call sumptuary goods. Sumptuary goods are special items whose use is limited to a particular group within a society. These restrictions are very often based on rank. High- status people, for instance, may wear certain kinds of clothing or jewelry forbidden to low-status people. Although sumptuary goods are frequently of great value as well, it is the status of the user, not his or her wealth, that governs access to them. A modern example is the adornment of British royalty. Queen Elizabeth Q wears the Crown of St. George because of her status as queen, rather than because of any personal wealth. But a diamond tiara from Tiffany's is not a sumptuary item because anyone with enough money, no matter what rank, status or occupation, may wear it. Although sumptuary goods are usually ornamental, they may consist of less material items. The playing in the United States of "Hail to the Chief' only for the president is just one example. Three lines of evidence suggest that the pre- historic bronzes from the Danish bogs were sump- tuary goods before their deposition. First, they are often very striking in appearance and yet lack practi- cal function. An example is found in the belt plates of the Early Bronze Age, which are made of flat bronze discs often engraved with spiral designs and finished with a protruding spike in the center. They were worn around the waist. Some belt plates found in hoards and graves are 25 centimeters in diameter, with a central spike of five to six centimeters, a size that clearly would have made them difficult to fasten and awkward to wear as jewelry. Similarly, the Late Bronze Age fibulae or brooches and the so-called hanging vessels (another kind of belt orna- ment) are so heavy that they would have been a nuisance to wear. One hanging vessel in the Na- tional Museum in Copenhagen weighs 2.3 pounds (1,045 grams) and several are over a pound in weight. The striking appearance of these objects, however, could make them useful as social badges. Second, all of the hoard objects are made of imported metals probably acquired from sources in central Germany and southwest England. There is not very much archaeological evidence about how the metal was procured. Bronze Age Danes interested in acquiring metal, however, would have to put extra time and labor into producing something to trade for the metal, and someone would have to make long and perhaps dangerous trips to acquire it. Transportation of the metal might have been accomplished on foot or by boat. There is evi- dence ofBronze Age boats in Denmark from carvings of many-oared boats found on rocks throughout southern Scandinavia. It also appears that the bronze hoard objects were made by craft specialists. Only highly trained artisans could create the en- graved ornamentation of these objects. The objects in a hoard would have been valuable and relatively uncommon possessions in Danish society. T he most striking evidence that the hoards repre- sent sumptuary goods is their arrangement into sets which appear to be organized according to some sort of rule. The best example comes from the Danish hoards of women's ornaments from the ninth to eighth centuries b.c. These 81 hoards, from all over Denmark, can be divided into 101 individual sets of women's ornaments, each one apparently belonging to a different person. There are 21 different types of sets. The simplest contain only one kind of artifact: Januaiy/Februaiy 1982 39</page><page sequence="4">40 Archaeology</page><page sequence="5">This large Early Bronze Age hoard from northwestern Zealand contains numerous ornaments for women, including belt plates, neck collars, small decorative plates called tutuli, and bronze tubes to decorate the string skirts worn by women. The orna- ments of several women are probably represented here. The large belt plate (center) is approximately 25 centimeters in diameter. for example, a pair of neckrings. More complex sets contain two or three different kinds of artifacts. And the most complex sets consist of five artifact types: belt plates, hanging vessels, neckrings, armbands, and fibulae. There is usually only one belt plate, hanging vessel, and/or fibula in a set, but several neckrings or armrings might be used together. These 21 different types of sets can be arranged into five levels of complexity depending on the number - from one to five - of different artifact types included in each set. (Two neckrings or three armbands count as only one type.) Each level in- volves ornament sets which may vary in content, but are similar in the actual number of artifact types they contain. The addition of a new artifact type signifies a new social characteristic - a further step up the social hierarchy. A modern example can be found in the sumptuary rules of the Catholic Church. All priests, for example, wear alb, chasuble, cincture, and cope, which are different pieces of clothing. Deacons wear, in addition, another piece called a dalmatic; cardinals wear an additional item called a tunicle; and cardinals, bishops and the pope also wear skullcap, miter, ring, gloves, and pectoral cross, all of which may differ in color or ornament depending on rank. Each additional new article of clothing means an increase in rank and authority. Just as there are fewer bishops than deacons, the Bronze Age hoards decrease in the number of sets from the simplest to the most complex level. The more complex sets were worn by higher-ranking in- dividuals, and the less complex sets were worn by the more numerous lower-ranking individuals. There was, no doubt, a category of the lowest-ranking people in the society without any sumptuary goods at all. Another line of evidence suggests that the orna- ments apparently could not be combined randomly as they would have been if they were ordinary personal jewelry. For example, it appears that one could wear a hanging vessel alone, but if a woman wore a belt plate, she had to combine it with a hang- ing vessel. This kind of restriction is suggested by the fact that about 60 percent of all sets with hanging vessels do not contain belt plates (37 out of 61), but only eight percent of all sets with belt plates do not contain hanging vessels (two out of 25). Also, fibulae are more common in complex sets than in simple ones; there are only four examples of fibulae com- bined with one other ornament type, but 15 examples of fibulae combined with two or more ornament types. It seems then that the acquisition of certain orna- ment types was limited by rules, and acquiring one ornament type was apparently a prerequisite for ac- January/February 1982 41</page><page sequence="6">(Above, top) Bronze swords such as these from Early Bronze Age graves and hoards may be found alone , in pairs, or accompanied by bronze spearpoints , axes, dag- gers , and/ or armbands.

For example, a woman had to acquire a hanging vessel before a belt plate. This kind of restriction would not be expected if the ornaments were jewelry combined according to personal taste. Further, fewer and fewer people had access to the most complex arrangements of ornaments, implying a complex sumptuary system. This kind of arrange- ment of sumptuary goods suggests that Late Bronze Age Denmark was organized in a ranked society, probably as a chiefdom with a hereditary elite in control. An analysis of the Early Bronze Age graves done in the early 1970s by Klavs Randsborg of the University of Copenhagen shows that this kind of ranking was present even then. Not all the Late Bronze Age hoards of Denmark contain these neckrings, brooches and other rather personal items. Some hoards yield bronze buckets and/or cups, bronze shields, helmets, battle axes, and various kinds of ornamental horsegear. These non- jewelry hoards are rare in number and very valuable in terms of metal weight and craftsmanship. They also seem to indicate high rank. Many of the objects are impractical; for example, the shields are very thin, the helmets with tall curved metal horns are top heavy, and the battle axes are made of a thin sheet of metal cast over a clay core. Many of these objects are associated with feasting or warfare. Ethnographic evidence from living societies indicates that chiefs are generally responsi- ble for holding feasts and celebrations and for lead- ing raids and battles. Hawaiian chiefs, for example, collected tribute of food and goods from the general population, and then used this surplus to give lavish community feasts which enhanced the chief's status and reputation for generosity. In other societies, the chief would be a war leader if conflict over land or resources broke out with neighboring cultures. Most likely the highest ranking chiefs of the Danish Bronze Age owned these valuable non-jew- elry hoards. The fact that these non-jewelry items are usually found in different hoards from the ones containing personal jewelry suggests that different kinds of people are involved. The special items were probably controlled and deposited by the highest- ranking members of the society, while the jeweliy hoards were probably deposited by other, lesser- ranking people. Altogether, the archaeological evi- dence from both types of Bronze Age hoards suggests a chiefdom-like social organization in Denmark. The general population was apparently organized in a ranked fashion with only some members having ac- cess to the most complex sumptuary goods. Espe- cially high-ranking chiefs controlled feasting and warfare and the elaborate artifacts associated with these activities. T he Danish hoards, basically religious in nature, represent the complex intertwining of religion and social organization. It appears that the bronze objects in the hoards were first used as sumptuary goods, Januaiy/Februaiy 1982 43</page><page sequence="8">This hoard from Hove on Zealand dates to the same period as the Budsene well (right), and contains bronze bridle bits as well as ornaments to be worn by a woman . The presence ofhorsegear in some bog deposits suggests some kind of ritual significance for horses. and thus symbolically represented the high status of those who controlled them. Then, they became offer- ings in some kind of ritual, possibly to honor or pla- cate spiritual beings. In ethnographically recorded chiefdoms, it is common for the elite to control not only politics and economics, but religion as well. Control of religion, of course, helps the elite maintain their high status. Their power is very often but- tressed by the population's firm belief that only the elite can communicate effectively with the spiritual world. The Danish chiefs and elite were apparently in this position. Yet while religion obviously helped maintain the elite, at the same time it prevented them from becoming overbearingly powerful. High status was confirmed by the elite's control of the proper objects - sumptuary items - needed for the offerings to the gods. The elite were probably con- strained in the exercise of their power by moral re- quirements to be modest before the gods. And of course, after they made the offerings they had given up much of their wealth and status symbols, and thus returned to a status and financial position more like that of the ordinary population. The most vital function of the Bronze Age hoards and the elite members of society who controlled them was probably to insure fertility of the crops, herds and women. Archaeologists have uncovered animal bones in some hoards and harvesting sickles in others to support this interpretation. These remains suggest that sacrificial slaughtering and eating of - animals and symbolic harvesting of crops were part of the prehistoric fertility rituals. Further, some of the engraved ornamentation on the bronzes are motifs related to fertility in the mythology of numer- ous European and other Old World cultures. These include water, snakes, horses, the sun, an axe and horns. Archaeologists cannot prove that the Bronze Age Danes were trying to control fertility through 44 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">This hoard from southeastern Denmark provides some of the most striking evidence of the ritual position of the hoards. The ornaments - hanging vessels, belt plates, and spiral armrings - date to the middle of the Late Bronze Age or about 800-700 b.c. They were found inside a primitive well which also contained the sacrificial bones of sheep, pigs , cattle, and horses. Found in 1903, this hoard, called theBudsene hoard, is one of the few to be investigated and retrieved by professional archaeologists. religion, but the presence of these symbols, common from a later time, suggests that this was in fact probable. Certainly, ritual concern with fertility shows up in the earliest written documents about this part of the world. Tacitus, for example, describes his goddess on an island as "Mother Earth." It would have been very useful to the elite if they could have maintained their control over fertility religion. A population is not likely to rebel against those who control access to a spiritual world which influences health and prosperity. Yet, where differ- ences in wealth and authority exist, resentment and rebellion may grow in spite of fears of spiritual re- tribution. The offering ritual, as reflected in the hoards, also helped to ameliorate these tensions. It consisted, after all, of burying wealth and status symbols. The ritual thus allowed high-status indi- viduals to demonstrate their power by making the appropriate gifts to the gods. At the same time, it served to remove wealth and sumptuary goods from the elite's control. When the offering ritual was over, the elite were reduced in wealth and lost control of the very sumptuary goods which had set them apart from the general population. Tensions would be eased, yet the hierarchical ranking would remain clear. Contemporary ethnography has a number of similar examples. One is the so-called cargo system of Mesoamerica. Here, the expenses and organiza- tion (called cargoes) of various religious festivals ro- tate among the wealthy and high-status men of the community. Social position can be maintained only by taking on the most expensive and complex cargoes. Whoever takes on the responsibility is al- most impoverished in the process, but public acknowledgement of his contribution to the festival strengthens his elite status. Nevertheless, envy of his wealth is lessened in the rest of the community because his resources are greatly reduced. The hoards from the Danish Bronze Age, then, provide information about religious and social activ- ity in the contemporary culture. Some important insights also come from historically documented and living cultures. The present analysis of the hoards reveals evidence of a ranked society in Denmark during the Late Bronze Age, and suggests ways in which the ranking system was maintained. This study of the hoards is based on the common anthropological premise that different aspects of hu- man culture - social, economic, political, and reli- gious - cannot be fully understood in isolation but are intricately intertwined.
