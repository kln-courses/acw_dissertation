<plain_text><page sequence="1">The History of the World and Ralegh's Skepticism By Ernest A. Strathmann T HE second book of the History of the World, Sir Walter Ralegh, while taking exception to the idea that prosperity is a "signe or effect of true Religion' pays his respects to those controversialists in divinity who are facile in the use of "atheist" and similar epithets: Such is the blinde zeale of Bozius, who writing against those whom he falsly termes impious, giues strength to such as are impious indeede. But such indiscretion is vsually found among men of his humour: who hau- ing once either foolishly imbraced the dreames of others: or vainely fashioned in their owne braines any strange Chimaera's of Diuinitie, condemne all such in the pride of their zeale, as Atheists and Infidells, that are not transported with the like intemperate ignorance. Great pit- tie it is that such madde Dogges are oftentimes incouraged by those, who hauing the command of many tongues, when they themselues cannot touch a man in open and generous opposition, will wound him secretly by the malicious vertue of an Hypocrite.' Like so many half-revealing allusions in the History, the last sen- tence has a personal ring: with such "madde Dogges" Ralegh had had acquaintance enough. The charge of atheism followed him all his life,2 in part because his insolent disregard for popular opinion made him careless of rebuttal, and possibly also because those who had command of many tongues helped to keep the charges alive. The accusations of the sixteenth century against Ralegh and his 1 History of the World (London, 1614), Bk. II, chap. viii, sec. 3, pp. 367-68. Hereafter all references to the History will be to book, chapter, and section in the order cited, fol- lowed by the page reference to the first edition. The book and chapter references will be useful for checking quotations in other editions, and, for the first edition (the text of which is paged i to 651 for Bks. I and II, and 1 to 776 for Bks. III-V), will indicate in which half of the volume the page reference falls. References to the Preface are by signature in the first edition. Superior letters in quotations are lowered. 2 The principal early charges include: (1) in 1592, an allusion by Parsons (or Cress- well, according to C. E Tucker Brooke, ELH, V, 108) to Sir Walter Ralegh's "school of atheism"; (2) in 1593, Baines's report on Marlowe's assertion that Ralegh's man Har- riot could do more than Moses, who was "but a juggler"; (3) undated (probably in 1593), a spy's report that Cholmeley quoted Marlowe as saying that he had read the "atheist lecture" to Ralegh and others. The most direct charges occur in the deposi- tion made before the appointees of the Queen's Commission for Causes Ecclesiastical, at Cerne Abbas, in March, 1594. References during the remainder of Ralegh's life and after his death are not uncommon, but will be introduced here only when pertinent E 265 I</page><page sequence="2">266 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY friends have in the twentieth aroused new interest, and have been accepted (or rejected) with varying degrees of qualification. In all the discussion, however, relatively little use has been made of Ral- egh's greatest work. His biographers have drawn upon it for many specific autobiographical references; less notice has been taken of the kind of observation quoted above and of digressions into opin- ion on controversial matters. Miss Bradbrook, in her account of the "School of Night' quotes several passages from the Preface,' and Mr. Buckley dismisses the History with the remark that, in the works on war and discovery, "there is naturally hardly a reference to religion, and little more in the History of the World, although it begins with some pious observations of a strictly conventional char- acter'4 The statement is surprising: religion is a principal topic among the great variety of subjects which elicit Ralegh's personal comment-indeed, is the foundation of the whole work. The interest of the numerous digressions in the History lies in two directions: backward, for an estimate of Ralegh's thought; for- ward, by reason of the great and often imperfectly understood in- to the discussion. See Frederick S. Boas, Marlowe and His Circle (Oxford, 1929), pp. 70-72, 79-92; George T Buckley, Atheism in the English Renaissance (Chicago, 1932), pp. 137-52; and Edward Thompson, Sir Walter Ralegh (London, 1935), pp. 67-76 et passim. The questions and depositions at the Cerne Abbas inquiry, found in Harleian MS 6849, are printed in full in Willobie His Avisa, ed. G. B. Harrison (London, 1926), App. III; see also pp. 204-13. These few references among the many books dealing with the subject will suffice for the documents in the case. 3M. C. Bradbrook, The School of Night: A Study of the Literary Relationships of Sir I alter Ralegh (Cambridge, 1936), chap. iii. Her comment (p. 6i), "The Preface to the History of the World reiterates the substance of the Sceptic in a condensed form,' is misleading. In the Preface, the limitations of man's knowledge of nature are cited to show his presumptuous folly in pretending to know how God made the world; The Sceptic, as Miss Bradbrook points out, is limited in application to the world of nature. Mr. Buckley (op. cit., pp. 146-49), in his discussion of Ralegh's essay, refers to the Chris- tian apologists' use of skeptical arguments in attacking human learning. J. Beau, "La Religion de Sir Walter Ralegh,' Revue Anglo-Ame'ricaine, XI, 410-22, devotes several pages to the History, by way of illustration of Ralegh's mature religious beliefs, which, M. Beau believes, had been deepened by experience and adversity after a mere outward conformity in the 1590's. "Dans sa prison des bords de Ia Tamise, il a laisse derril6re lui l'intransigeance intellectuelle de sa jeunesse; il n'accorde plus tous les droits i la raison, mais admet ceux du coeur et la valeur d'une fo;" (P 417.) The available evidence does not seem to justify so marked a contrast between Ralegh's views in "youth" and after imprisonment. 4 Op. cit., p. 145. The omission of the History leaves a serious gap in Mr. Buckley's discussion, but it does not impair the great value which his chapter on Ralegh derives from a background of broad study of sixteenth-century "atheism:'</page><page sequence="3">RALEGH'S SKEPTICISM 267 fluence of his work in the seventeenth century and later. Both in England and in the American colonies, Ralegh's History was recom- mended, often above all others, for its moral teaching.5 The recom- mendation found a special welcome among the Puritans because the author had been the victim of James I, but the popularity ex- tended no less to Anglican readers. Ralegh's opinions, having en- joyed the "life beyond life" accorded to the work of a master spirit, are worthy of record for the potential influence of the widely read work in which they are found, as well as for our understanding of the author himself. The present essay is a study of the History of the World in its bear- ing, negative as well as positive, upon Ralegh's skepticism, defined, in its popular sense, as a questioning attitude toward authority or accepted beliefs, rather than in a strict philosophical or religious meaning.6 On the basis of this study, made against the background of a knowledge of Ralegh's life and the record of an official investi- gation of his "atheism' it should be possible to distinguish more clearly between the man's beliefs and his reputation, and in some measure to account for the disparity. Topics pertinent to such an undertaking include: (1) the religious foundation of the ethical teaching in the History of the World; (2) Ralegh's religious beliefs, especially those on which his orthodoxy was questioned; (3) his opinions on the proper use of authorities; and (4) the relevancy of the History to the charges of "atheism.7 ';For evidence of its popularity in England, see Charles H. Firth, "Sir Walter Ral- eigh's History of the World' Proceedings of the British Academy, VIII, 13-15. In Amer- ica it was "the most popular of all histories by an Englishman during the seventeenth century.... Favored by the Puritans because it demonstrated the divine purpose in human events, the book was also well-liked by Anglicans in Virginia: for example, men like the second Richard Lee looked upon it as a work of wisdom:" (Louis B. Wright, "The Reading of Our Colonial Ancestors,' ELH, IV, 96.) 1 In the sixteenth century, "atheism" could be defined in the broad meaning here attached to skepticism, but the strength of its modern denotation makes its use awk- ward. 7Many of Ralegh's comments on the state and law, relevant but not immediately pertinent, are not included here; nor can a general review of current theories about the "School of Night" be attempted within the limits of this paper. For a synopsis of the opinions on science in the History see n. 82, below.</page><page sequence="4">268 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY A belief in an omnipotent God who visits upon sinful men and nations just and inevitable punishments is the foundation of the morality taught in the History of the World. Ralegh would not have understood a nineteenth-century criticism of his didactic purpose on the ground that "it is the. part of the moral teacher rather than of the historian to point out these lessons. Ralegh confuses the two functions, and is too much of a preacher to be a historian"8 For Ralegh, as for his contemporaries, "the end and scope of al Historie" is "to teach by examples of times past, such wisdome as may guide our desires and actions"'9 and the instruction is at all times cognizant of God's love and God's wrath. Full recognition of this theory of history is essential for a valuation of Ralegh's statements on other matters of faith; his narrative is so permeated by the belief in divine justice that one cannot dismiss lightly his declarations concern- ing God, the creation, and the soul, on which his orthodoxy was questioned. The judgments of God being evident in all times and places, Ralegh begins his story with the creation, which necessarily implies Providence, whatever the philosophers may say to the contrary. The examples of diuine prouidence, euery where found (the first di- uine Histories being nothing else but a continuation of such examples) haue perswaded me to fetch my beginning from the beginning of all things; to wit, Creation. For though these two glorious actions of the Almightie be so neare, and (as it were) linked together, that the one nec- essarily implyeth the other: Creation, inferring Prouidence: (for what Father forsaketh the child that he hath begotten?) and Prouidence pre- supposing Creation) Yet many of those that haue seemed to excell in worldly wisedome, haue gone about to disioyne this coherence; the Epi- cure denying both Creation &amp;c Prouidence, but granting that the world had a beginning; the Aristotelian granting Prouidence, but denying both the Creation and the Beginning." 8 Louise Creighton, Life of Sir Walter Ralegh (London, 1877), p. 206.

The examples are in no wise invalidated by their antiquity, because the iudgements of GOD are for euer vnchangeable; neither is he wearied by the long processe of time, and won to giue his blessing in one age, to that which he hath cursed in another. Wherefore those that are wise, or whose wisdome, if it be not great, yet is true and well grounded; will bee able to discerne the bitter fruites of irreligious policie, as well among those examples that are found in ages remoued farre from the present, as in those of latter times.'2 Further, there is little variety in the actions of men, governed as they are by the same affections."3 But, lest the reader think that recent examples of the "bitter fruites of irreligious policie" are wanting, Ralegh proceeds with a scathing review of the conduct of English and European monarchs down to Henry VIII, only James, it would appear, being exempt from the traditional misconduct of kings.' Ralegh's confidence in the value of the lessons of history is not matched by an optimistic view of their effectiveness. Human history is not likely to succeed if the divinely inspired Scriptures have made no impress upon man's worldliness, and our professions are more godly than our performances. Since "we are compounded of earth"' No meruaile then that our thoughts are also earthlie: and it is lesse to bee wondred at, that the words of worthlesse men cannot cleanse them; seeing their doctrine and instruction, whose vnderstanding the Holy Ghost vouchsafed to inhabite, haue not performed it.... For although Religion, and the truth thereof, bee in euery mans mouth, yea in the discourse of euery woman, who for the greatest number are but Idolls of vanitie: what is it other than an vniuersall dissimulation? Wee pro- fesse that wee know GOD: but by workes we deny him. For Beatitude doth not consist in the knowledge of diuine things, but in a diuine life: for the Deuills know them better than men....

For Charitie, lustice, and Truth, haue but their being in termes, like the Philosophers Materia prima.5 As a soldier, courtier, and politician, Ralegh has a lively interest in the immediate causes of man's conduct, and his own varied ex- perience lends vitality to his analyses of long-past events in court and field. But he insists upon the subordination of all explanations of causes and motives to a humble recognition of controlling Provi- dence, which works its ends by diverse instruments and the frail "affections" of men. The peculiar merit of biblical history is that events are referred unto the revealed will of God, even if the "concur- rence of second causes with their effects, is in these bookes nothing largely described'." Secular histories, pretending a more ambitious treatment of second causes, do not attain greater exactness, since the heart of man is unsearchable and his motives often obscure. "In- formations are often false, records not alwaies true, and notorious actions commonly insufficient to discouer the passions, which did set them first on foote'17 Yet it is not unlawful for the historian to gather from profane sources information about second causes, pro- vided he does not "derogate from the first causes, by ascribing to the second more than was due'."8 The principle is kept constantly in mind: it may take the form of a brief conditional parenthesis, as when Ralegh begins a discussion of the decay of Alexander's army with "The causes whereof (vnder the diuine ordinance). . U.";" or it may conclude an awful lesson: So also hath God punished the same and the like sinnes in all after-times, and in these our daies by the same famine, plagues, warre, losse, vexation, death, sicknesse, and calamities, howsoeuer the wise men of the world raise these effectes no higher than to second causes, and such other acci- dents, which, as being next their eyes and eares, seeme to them to worke euery alteration that happeneth.'0 Ralegh is not content with perfunctory illustration of the work- ing of divine Providence and divine judgment; examples are nu- '5 Pref., sig.

On the story of the early life of Moses, he comments: There is not therefore the smallest accident, which may seeme vnto men as falling out by chance, and of no consequence: but that the same is caused by God to effect somewhat else by: yea, and oftentimes to effect things of the greatest worldly importance, either presently, or in many yeares after, when the occasions are either not considered, or forgotten.' God's promises to his chosen people are conditional on their obedi- ence and worship; the conditions not observed, it is irreligious to accuse him of failure to keep promises.' God is merciful but just, and angry in justice;' his wrath is severe on both places and men;&gt; divine Providence, in the unspeakable greatness of its sovereignty, is just and majestical, "not (as Herodotus falsly termes it, and like an Atheist) enuious or malicious"" How fortunate is England in having a king who can grasp, even teach, that God is a sharp school- master for rulers who forget the limitations of their earthly power!' God may use evil spirits as the ministers of his vengeance;' the corrupt affections of men accomplish his hidden purposes by the self-defeat of their own worldly wisdom;28 God allows the wicked to run their evil courses before visiting upon them the fruits of their iniquities, but the suffering of the righteous works to their own good.' God is the giver of victories; if success comes from individual labor and skilful planning, then thanks are due "both for the vic- torie, and for those vertues by which the victorie was gotten:"' The ethical inferences of this belief in divine sovereignty are given spe- cific as well as general statement.

In Books II, III, and IV, concerned largely with pagan history, Ralegh has less to say on the subject of God's control of human affairs than in Books I and II, wherein the unquestionable words of the prophets point the moral of a narrative based upon the Old Testament. But even in pagan history references to God's judgments are not infrequent, though briefly stated.3. Not only are the Scrip- tures divinely inspired, but they alone furnish us with patterns of the truly heroical, which, in Ralegh's definition of the term, owes its perfection to the fountain of all goodness. To be a good Gouernour is a rare commendation; and to preferre the Weale publicke aboue all respects whatsoeuer, is the Vertue iustly termed Heroicall. Of this Vertue, many ages affoord not many examples. Hector is named by Aristotle, as one of them; and deseruedlie, if this praise be due to extraordinarie heighth of fortitude, vsed in defence of a mans owne countrie. But if we consider, that loue of the generall good cannot be perfect, without reference vnto the fountaine of all goodnesse: wee shall finde, that no Morall vertue, how great soeuer, can, by it selfe, de- serue the comemndation of more than Vertue, as the Heroicall doth. Wherefore we must search the Scriptures, for patterns hereof; such, as Dauid, Iosaphat, and losias were.33 Ralegh's constant emphasis upon the religious implications of man's conduct is sufficient answer to the idea that the religious ele- ment in the History is a sop to convention, an outward conformity. To borrow the figure which Ralegh applied to the soul, the lesson of God's justice is present in the History, not as a mariner in a ship, but everywhere, giving life and motion to the whole. There are evi- al II, vi, 8, PP. 327-28. The sin is greater when committed by those in high place. (III, x, 7, p. ii8.) 32E.g., Bk. III: viii, 8, p. ioo; viii, I1, p. 104. Bk.

The passage quoted is followed by a description of a Christian king.</page><page sequence="9">RALEGH'S SKEPTICISM 273 dences enough of discretion and conformity in the History-witness the deference to James; but discretion and conformity would not explain Ralegh's acceptance and detailed application, in such an ambitious and extensive undertaking as the History, of an ethical and religious system in which he merely affected belief. The per- vasiveness of the doctrine of God's universal sovereignty is strong testimony for the sincerity of other declarations on religious ques- tions, conventional though they be. II The discussion of religious topics in the History of the World places in clearer perspective the implications and direct allegations of the inquiry at Cerne Abbas,' in which several witnesses testified that Sir Walter Ralegh was suspected of atheism. Carew Ralegh was charged with loose speeches; Thomas Harriot, a mathematician and astronomer of Ralegh's household, was accused by three witnesses of holding atheistic opinions; and several lesser persons were named. But the most trustworthy and detailed item"5 of evidence concerns an academic discussion between Ralegh and a minister, Ralph Iron- side, concerning the nature of the soul. Although the History is a formal work, published twenty years after the supposedly private conversation investigated at Cerne Abbas, there are good reasons for bringing the two into juxtaposition. On the main questions, the definitions of the soul and of God, Ralegh says in print what he is reported to have said in his brief colloquy with Ironside; and the History and the depositions, taken together, contain fairly definite clues to the origins of Ralegh's reputation as an "atheist' At the now famous dinner at the home of Sir George Trenchard, one summer evening in 1593, Sir Ralph Horsey's reproof of "loose 34See n. 2, above. App. III of Willobie His Avisa, containing the questions and deposi- tions at this investigation, should be read in full; the original document, free from the predispositions of modern criticism, tells its story more clearly than secondary accounts, which tend to exaggerate the extremity of Ralegh's position. Willobie His Avisa, ed. Harrison, pp. 265-68. Following advice of counsel, Ironside refused to give hearsay evidence, and submitted his testimony in writing. In modern accounts he is represented as the butt of the Raleghs' wit, and as something of a fool for holding opinions common to many educated men of his time. By his own testimony (on which all later accounts are based), Ironside acquits himself with dignity, although with no show of intellectual independence or originality.</page><page sequence="10">274 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY speeches" by Carew Ralegh led ultimately to questions, by both the Raleghs, concerning the nature of the soul. Ironside gave answers out of Aristotle, reserving the right to define first things in their own terms. The soul is "a sperituall &amp; immortall substance breathed into man by god:' and that spiritual and immortal substance is the soul; God is ens entium, and ens entium is God. Sir Walter objected that propositions in mathematics were demonstrable, disliked both an- swers, and called for grace to be said. Ironside's clear report is in sharp contrast to a statement which reveals how gossip distorted the account of the debate. John Davis, "Curate of motcombe, testified that he hath harde that Sr Walter Rawleigh hath argued wth one Mr Iron- syde at Sr George Trenchardes towchinge the beinge, or immortallitye of the soule, or such like; but the certaintye therof he cannot saye fur- ther, saving askinge the same of Mr Ironsyde vppon the reporte afore- sayde, he hath aunswered that the matter was not as the voice of the Countree reported therof, or to the like effecte.'6 The "voice of the Countree" was indeed mistaken: the conversation had been about the definitions of soul and God, not about immor- tality-a distinction missed by some modern critics, as well as by Curate John Davis. Ralegh doubted the possibility of defining either God or the soul, but that he believed in God and immortality the History gives abundant evidence. In the History, as in the conver- sation with Ironside, Ralegh's skepticism is directed against the au- thority of philosophers, not against Scripture. Man (saith Salomon) that can hardly discerne the things that are vpon the Earth, and with great labour finde out the things that are before vs; that hath so short a time in the world, as hee no sooner beginnes to learne, than to die; that hath in his memory but borrowed knowledge; in his vnderstanding, nothing trulie; that is ignorant of the Essence of his owne soule, and which the wisest of the Naturalists (if Aristotle bee hee) could neuer so much as define, but by the Action and effect, telling vs what it workes (which all men know as well as hee) but not what it is, which neither hee, nor any else, doth know, but GOD that created it; (for though I were perfect, yet I know not my soule, saith Iob.)

They tell us it is primus motor the first mover in man &amp;c. .3.8 When Ralegh attempts to find a satisfactory definition of the "Im- age of God, according to which man was first created" he has little patience with the intricacies of critical exegesis, but profound re- spect for the word of God. They [the schoolmen] also make the Image and Similitude diuers; and againe, they distinguish between imaginem Dei, and ad imaginem Dei, and spinne into small threds, with subtile distinctions, many times the plainenesse, and sinceritie of the Scriptures: their wits being like that strong water, that eateth through and dissolueth the purest gold.... For God knowes, what a multitude of meanings the wit of man imag- ineth to himselfe in the Scriptures, which neither Moses, the Prophets, or Apostles, euer conceiued.... Now if we may beleeue S. Paul before Peter Lombard and other Schoole-men, then it is as manifest as wordes can make it, that the image and similitude is but the same, for S. Paul vseth both the words directly in one sense."9 We are to know and consider "that God, who is eternall and infinite, hath not any bodily shape or composition, for it is both against his nature and his word; an errour of the Anthropomorphitae, against 37 Pref., sig. D3'r. 38 Willobie His Avisa, ed. Harrison, p. 266. The position is not, of course, unusual. Developing the point in "A Treatise of the Soul" (Works [1829], VIII, 571-9i), Ralegh quotes from Lactantius, Galen, Athanasius, and Augustine. In his essay "Of the Soule' Owen Felltham, certainly no freethinker, gives an opinion which even in language re- sembles Ralegh's: "'Tis certaine, Man hath a Soule; and as certaine, that it is immor- tall. But what, and how it is, in the perfect nature and substance of it; I confesse, my humane reason could neuer so informe me, as I could fully explaine it to my owne apprehension. 0 my GOD! what a clod of moving ignorance is Man! when all his in- dustry cannot instruct him, what himselfe is; when he knowes not that, whereby hee knowes that he does not know it."

Here, if not in scholastic philosophy, Ralegh is content to speak the language of the Reverend Ralph Ironside: In this frame and carcase God breathed the breath of life; and the man was a liuing soule: (that is) God gaue to a Bodie of earth and of corruptible matter, a Soule spirituall and incorruptible; not that God had any such bodilie instruments as men vse, but God breathed the Spirit of life and immortalitie into man, as he breatheth his grace daily into such as loue and feare him. The Spirit of God (saith ELIHV in IOB) hath made me, and the breath of the Almightie hath giuen me life: ... In which sentence (saith he [Rabanus]) the beggerlinesse of carnall sense is to be auoided ...

One of the general questions asked at Cerne Abbas was: "Whome doe you knowe . . . that hath otherwise spoken againste the beinge; or imortallitye of the soule of man? or that a mans soule shoulde dye &amp; become like the soule of a beaste, or such like; and when &amp; where was the same?"4' At the inquiry, only those who cited general report for authority answered "Ralegh' and the chief witness told a friend that the voice of the country gave a faulty account of his story. The History consistently and firmly maintains the being, immortality, and dignity of the soul of man, not only in formal discussions, but 40Ibid., P. 24. 41I, ii, 2, p. 27. 2 1i, i,4, p. 29.

In III, iii, 6 (p. 39), Cyrus is described as teaching his nobility and his sons the immortality of the soul.

Curate John Davis testified that "he hath harde Sr Walter Rawleigh by gen- erall reporte hath had some reasoninge against the dietye of god, and his omnipotencye,'4 but here again the origin of the story seems to be the conversation with Ironside, which Davis reported errone- ously in its bearing upon Ralegh's ideas about immortality. "Marrye quoth Sr Walter these 2 [soul and God] be like for neither coulde I lerne heitherto what god is'.'

Even false gods, if one believes in them, should be inviolate: Xerxes was impious in committing sacrilege upon the temple of Apollo, in whom he believed.'9 Of the History's professions of faith, one of the simplest concludes a discourse on fortune: But of this dispute of Fortune, and the rest, or of whatsoeuer Lords or Gods, imaginarie powers, or causes, the wit (or rather foolishnesse) of man hath found out: let vs resolue with St. Paul, who hath taught vs, that there is but one God, the Father) of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord, Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him; there are diuersities of operations, but God is the same which worketh all in all.' The last sentence is in harmony with positive disavowals of the iden- tity of God and Nature-all the more interesting in connection with the testimony at Cerne Abbas that Carew Ralegh said "there was a god in nature" For the rest; I do also account it not the meanest, but an impiety mon- strous, to confound God and Nature: be it but in tearmes.

In his account of the creation, Ralegh rejects emphatically any limitations upon the power of God, either by making the universe eternal or by postulating the existence of matter with which God worked.' The evidence is again at odds with external reports-this time, concerning the beliefs of Thomas Harriot (thrice mentioned at the Cerne Abbas inquiry) and their influence on the History. Anthony 'a Wood tells the story thus: But notwithstanding his great skill in mathematics, he had strange thoughts of the scripture, and always undervalued the old story of the creation of the world, and could never believe that trite position, Ex nihilo nihil fit. He made a Philosophical Theology, wherein he cast off the OLD TESTAMENT, SO that consequently the NEW would have no founda- tion. He was a Deist, and his doctrine he did impart to the said count and to Sir Walt. Raleigh when he was compiling the History of the World, and would controvert the matter with eminent divines of those times; who therefore having no good opinion of him, did look on the manner of his death as a judgment upon him for those matters, and for nullifying the scripture.'M On one point the influence is apparent: Ralegh, too, rejected the doctrine "ex nihilo nihil fit" as applied to God, although he ac- cepted it as applied to natural agents. But now for those, who from that ground, That out of nothing nothing is made, inferre the Worlds eternity; and yet not so saluage therein, as 62 Pref., sig. E2v. Cf. I, i, 10, p. 13: "That nature is no Principium per se; nor forme the giuer of being: and of our ignorance, how second causes should haue any proportion with their effiects"' Ascribing to Nature any first or sole power is like ascribing "some absolute vertue" to the helm and rudder of a ship, without consideration of the hand and mind of the helmsman.

But seeing their great Doctour Aristotle him selfe confesseth, quod omnes antiqui decreuerunt quasi quoddam rerum principium, ip- sum infinitum, That all the ancient decree a kind of beginning, and the same to bee infinite: and a little after, more largely and plainely, Princi- pium eius est nullum, sed ipsum omnium cernitur esse principium, ac omnia complecti ac regere: it is strange that this Philosopher, with his followers, should rather make choice out of falshood, to conclude fasly; than out of truth, to resolue truely.5' The denial of limitations upon the power of God is certainly no irreligious opinion. Ralegh's arguments concerning the creation, found chiefly in the Preface, are directed against human attempts to explain the workings of God. The passage on man's ignorance of his own soul, already quoted,' is part of an extended paragraph of scorn directed against our puny attempts to explain the Almighty. The strength of the conviction is apparent from its incidental use in a not-too-relevant context. Wherefore the Romane Poet Lucretius, affirming (as the Epicures in this point held truely against the Peripateticks) that the world had a be- ginning, . . . In other religious opinions, as in beliefs concerning God, the soul, and the creation, Ralegh is conservative. He considers the Ten Com- mandments a blessing to society and approved by human reason no less than faith.' He fears the spread of sects, as destructive of the dignity and order of the church and as a force for disunion and the ultimate loss of faith." According to his interpretation of ancient myth, "the secrets of Diuinitie, ought not to be imparted to the vnpure Vulgar""-an opinion of the kind which may have contrib- uted to his unpopularity. 55Pref., sig.

Is the story simply one of a bold mind chastened by adversity? How is the religious bias of the History to be reconciled with the charges which followed Ralegh all the latter part of his life? Possible answers have been suggested briefly in considering the relation of the History to the Cerne Abbas inquiry; further explanation requires some ac- count of Ralegh's attitude toward, and use of, his authorities. A skeptical point of view is more discernible in the method of the History than in its content. III Whatever Harriot's share in the compilation of the History may have been, there is no reflection of the repudiation of the Old Tes- tament alleged by Wood. Ralegh finds in the Scriptures his one unquestionable authority, and devotes to the agreement of the Tes- taments an entire section, of which the following passage on author- ship is typical: In the Author they agree, because both are of God, and therefore both one Testament and will of God in substance of doctrine. For as there was euer one Church; so was there one couenant, one adoption, and one doctrine. As the old law doth point at Christ, so doth the new law teach Christ: the old proposing him as to come, the new as already come; one and the same thing being promised in both; both tending to one, and the same end: euen the saluation of our soules: which according to S. Peter is the end of our faith.62 Even in "a matter but for the testimonie of the Scriptures exceeding all beliefe"' the divinely inspired word is final. Again and again Ralegh turns for the solution of some debated point to the Bible, holding up to his readers the simplicity and finality of the scriptural text, in contrast to the varying opinions found in profane writers and the commentaries.64 But it is not amiss to cite profane writers, "I Thompson, Ralegh, pp. 68, 189, 340. 62 II, iv, 1l, p. 281. 63 11, Xvii, 9, p. 492.

When Scripture is silent, on a point not touching our salvation (the two provisions are stated frequently), one may in good conscience seek the answers to vexed questions by the use of reason.68 Nor is there any harm in bringing reason to support a story related in Scripture, although admittedly man's faith should be sufficient without such merely human props.69 When Ralegh turns to human sources not blessed by divine in- spiration, he feels at liberty to exercise to the full his independence of judgment. He respectfully but firmly denies that the church fa- thers, upon whom he draws heavily for his materials, are infallible; he is impatient with the nonproductive wit of the schoolmen; and he is scornful of the Aristotelians' assertions of authority in philoso- phy and science. Of the church fathers he writes: And it is true, that many of the Fathers were farre wide from the vnder- standing of this place. I speake it not, that I my selfe dare presume to censure them, for I reuerence both their learning and their pietie, and yet not bound to follow them any further, then they are guided by truth: for they were men; Et humanum est errare.7' I reuerence the iudgements of the Fathers: but I know they were mis- taken in particulars.7' His attitude toward the schoolmen is sufficiently indicated by his comments on their discussion of the image and similitude of God.'

But doth it follow, that the positions of Heathen Philosophers, are vndoubted grounds and principles indeed, because so called? Or that ipsi dixerunt, doth make them to bee such? certainly no. But this is true, That where naturall reason hath built anything so strong against it selfe, as the same reason can hardly assaile it, much lesse batter it downe: the same in euery question of Nature, and finite power, may bee approued for a fundamentall law of humane knowledge.

He is not a trained scientist, nor a trained historian; but he makes sincere attempts to lay down rules of evidence for his guidance. Some of his best sentences are devoted to statements of method. He can see through the devices by which error may be spread: There is no errour, which hath not some slipperie and bad foundation, or some apparance of probabilitie resembling truth, which when men (who studie to be singular) finde out, (straining reason according to their fancies) they then publish to the world matter of contention, and jan- gling: not doubting but in the variable deformitie of mens minds to finde some partakers or sectatours, the better by their helpe to nurse and cher- ish such weake babes, as their owne inuentions haue begotten.76 Yet he does not object to holding with the minority on a given point: ... it behoueth me to giue reason for my owne opinion: and with so much the greater care and circumspection, because I walke aside, and in a way apart from the multitude; yet not alone, and without compan- ions, though the fewer in number: with whom I rather choose to endure the wounds of those dartes, which Enuie casteth at nouelty, than to goe on safely and sleepily in the easie waies of ancient mistakings: seeing to be learned in many errors, or to be ignorant in all things, hath little diuersity.77 In one instance he rejects religious bias in deciding between two opinions: For my selfe I do neither mislike the contrary opinion, because com- monly those of the Romish Religion labour to vphold it, Nor fauour 75 FranceA.

IV In content and method, the relevancy of the History of the World to a discussion of Ralegh's skepticism is obvious from the illustrative materials which have been presented. Objections based upon the date, the formality, or the incentives to caution in such a work may be answered briefly. The long interval between the time of the most active charges against Ralegh and the publication of the History is bridged by the fact that Ralegh published in 1614 what he said pri- vately in 1593. Naturally the History is more formal in style. But the Preface and much of the work proper are independent, even de- fiant, in tone, although Ralegh is exceedingly deferential when he writes about James and is anxious to appear in agreement with the royal author, sometimes at the expense of straining a point. To offset the danger of insufficient allowance for the caution of a work pub- lished by a state prisoner, it is only necessary to compare long set passages with incidental and apparently unguarded comments. The quotations presented in this paper show that an opinion sincerely held by Ralegh will appear as readily in a parenthesis or a casual aside as in a paragraph. Finally, many of the beliefs expounded in 7 II i, 7, p. 227- 79 I, vii, 2, pp. ioo-1oi. "O I, vii, 10, p. 123- 811 iii, 15, p. 65.The remark concludes a discussion of the terrestrial paradise. Ralegh struggles with the problem of the proper use of conjecture, and devotes to the subject a section entitled "A digression, wherein is maintained the libertie of vsing coniecture in Histories" (II, xxi, 6, pp. 535 ff.). He concludes that where evidence is lacking the historian may use conjecture grounded on probabilities, as long as he recognizes them as such.</page><page sequence="22">286 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY the History are in harmony with ideas found in the works of Ralegh which lie outside the present discussion. Consistency, of course, is not to be expected, either in the History or in the collected works; but a vein of deep religious feeling combined with mature intel- lectual independence may be found in many of his recorded utter- ances, in his poems, and in his tracts. How, then, did Ralegh acquire a persistent reputation as an "atheist"? Although finality is impossible in the answer to such a question, the evidence from the History, from the Cerne Abbas in- quiry, and from his life is fairly clear. Ralegh's independence of widely accepted authority and his admiration for and defense of science2 and scientific method were contributing causes. There is no point, in this condensed survey of his remarks on method, on which he would not find support among his more liberal contem- poraries.83 But the orthodox could look askance at even respectful disagreement with the church fathers; the dogmatic resented an im- patient contempt for the system to which they adhered; the ignorant confused metaphysical debate with religious doubt, and distrusted an enthusiasm for science or "natural magic:" Ralegh's pride, inso- lence, and indifference to enmities, and possibly attacks by his ad- versaries helped to spread the report of 'atheism:' The "rascal mul- titude" is as common a phrase in the History as in any Elizabethan work, and Ralegh thought divinity too pure for communication to the vulgar. On one occasion, the Raleghs impudently appropriated "I Space does not permit a detailed account, in the present essay, of Ralegh's views on science in the History. In brief, he defends the ancient dignity of "natural magic" from later abuse of the term and practice; disapproves judicial astrology, but not natural astrology; praises Archimedes for his cultivation of pure science; places a high value on mathematics; and reflects wisely upon the social responsibilities of an inventor. A sentence which defends scientists from charges of black art is an excellent summary of his opinions: "For the properties and powers which God hath giuen to naturall things, are such as where hee also bestoweth the knowledge to vnderstand their hidden and best vertues, many things by them are brought to passe, which seeme altogether impossible, and aboue nature or art:' (II, vi, 7, p 321.) The context in which this pas- sage occurs has a slight but interesting bearing upon Marlowe's alleged remarks about Moses being but a juggler. Further discussion of the subject may be found in an article, entitled "Sir Walter Ralegh on Natural Philosophy;' which will appear in the Modern Language Quarterly, published by the University of Washington Press. 3 E.g., Ralegh is fond of demonstrating how merely human reason often supports the Bible story, even though he insists that faith alone is enough to accept the scriptural account. An elaboration of the method may be found in William Evans, A Translation of the Booke of Nature into the Use of Grace (Oxford, 1i33).</page><page sequence="23">RALEGH'S SKEPTICISM 287 a clergyman's horse,8" and Sir Walter acquired Sherborne at the ex- pense of the church.' In the eyes of the godly, disrespect for God's ministers is not always distinguishable from disrespect for God, any more than conversation about the definition of "soul" is distinguish- able from doubt about immortality. Damnably proud, Ralegh seems to have made no attempt to scotch the rumors and charges of irre- ligion. There is no necessity to assume that the Cerne Abbas inquiry left him untouched because of his power and influence: the best evidence presented there shows a lively intellectual curiosity on Ralegh's part, but not religious skepticism. Finally, although proof is lacking, the comment quoted from the History, at the very begin- ning of this paper, may indicate that Ralegh's enemies found it profitable to keep the charge alive, just as Coke found it a useful club in a trial for treason. The History of the World, representing the fruits of a lifetime of private study as well as of intensive preparation for the specific task, reveals more clearly and in greater detail than any other work what may be called the intellectual life of Sir Walter Ralegh. He has an independent rather than an original mind, able to penetrate the sophistries of academic debate and impatient of theological hair- splitting. In religion he is no skeptic, though definitely opposed to an anthropomorphic interpretation of the Scriptures; in all human affairs, however, he is skeptical, and even his errors and occasional credulities are understandable against the background of Renais- sance knowledge. When the contemporary records of charges and hearsay reports are examined in the light of his own statements of belief, it is possible to see in Ralegh a firm religious faith, clouded in the popular view by an independence, an indifference, an inquisi- tiveness, and a scientific bent which the resentful and the hostile could readily convert into the all-embracing "atheism" of the Eliza- bethan age. 84 Willobie His Avisa, ed.
