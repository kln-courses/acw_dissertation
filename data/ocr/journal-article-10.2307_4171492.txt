<plain_text><page sequence="1">Uma-Mahesvara Theme in Nepali Sculpture by PRATAPADITYA PAL Siva is by far the most popular divinity of the Hindus in Nepal. Generally, he is wor- shipped symbolically by the linga (the phallic emblem), his anthropomorphic repre- sentations in plastic art being rarer than those of other major divinities. Although he is the Hindu god of destruction, he also has benign manifestations. One such mani- festation is known in iconographical texts as "Uma-Mahesvaramurti." Mahesvara is an alternate name of Siva, while Uma is one of the many appelations of his wife, who is more commonly known as P5rvatl. In the plastic representations of this theme, the two are usually portrayed seated together in an amorous mood as in a beautiful bronze in the Museum (Fig. 1). Recently the Museum has acquired another and more complex gilt-copper image representing the same theme (Fig. 2 &amp; cover). Cast in the cire-perdu method, the sculpture is an unusually fine example of the technical dexterity of the Newari artists, who were renowned in the neighboring countries and as far away as China for their accomplishment in metal casting. The two central figures represent Mahesvara (Siva) and his wife Uma (Pdrvatd). Mahes- vara sits in a posture of relaxed ease on a double lotus seat, the upper edge of which is decorated with the pearl motif. This double lotus is placed on an inch high layer that simulates in a very stylized manner the form of rocks. On Mahesvara's left knee is poised Uma with her left leg placed horizontally across her right thigh in the pos- ture known as lalitasana. Mahesvara wears a dhoti, Uma a long skirt-like garment, both of which show the same floral design. Both of them are elaborately ornamented and crowned, the ornaments being richly encrusted with semiprecious stones and the upper torso of each being left completely bare. Characteristically, the god's hair is arranged in a chignon (jatamukuta) to emphasize his character as a mendicant, and is adorned with a skull and the crescent moon. His sacred thread is composed of pearls and a snake forms the ornament for his right ear. The skull and the snake sym- bolize his terrifying (Rudra or Bhairava) aspect, while the crescent moon serves as an ornament. The third eye on the forehead is a sign of his omniscience as well as the element with which he destroys evil. Of his four arms, the attributes in the two rear hands are missing. The normal right hand displays the gesture of exposition (vyakhy- anamudra), while the left encircles Uma and rests below her breast. Uma is given a normal pair of arms, the right embracing her husband around his neck while the left 85</page><page sequence="2">M ea. -BoeNepal, 1 r n C 2.3 1. Uma-Mahe'svara.

The lotus is one of the most common attributes of goddesses in Indian iconography, and it symbolizes both beauty and abundance. Behind Mahesvara is his favorite bull, Nandi. The figures are set off against an ornate aureole, the outer rim of which is de- signed in stylized flame shapes, while the inner circle shows a rich floral motif. Two other smaller images are placed on either side of the divine couple on top of the plain rectangular pedestal. The four-armed female on the proper right, seated on a lotus, is Sarasvati, the goddess of learning and one of the daughters of Uma and Mahesvara. With her two principal hands she plays upon the vina, as she is also the goddess of music, while the two rear hands hold the rosary and the manuscript, the symbols of knowledge. The male figure astride a peacock to the left of the main couple is their son Karttikeya. As he is the war-god, his attributes are usually the bow and the arrow but these are missing in the present image. Of the five figures each seated in lalitasana in a row along the base of the pedestal (Fig. 3), the central one is that of Ganes'a, the elder son of Uma and Mahesvara. Of his four arms, the two in the rear carry the battle-axe and a lotus, while the normal pair holds part of his broken tusk and a bowl of sweetmeats. Ganes'a's presence may be explained by the fact that he is the guardian in chief of Siva's abode, which is why he carries the battle-axe. As to the two other attributes, the tusk and the sweetmeats, there are several explanations. According to the Brahmandapurana,' Gan.esa once refused to allow Parasurama to see Siva and Parvati, who were engaged in a conversation. A battle between the two ensued and Parasurama hurled his battle-axe (given him by Siva) at Ganes'a, who, out of respect for his father's weapon, received the blow on one of his tusks and it broke. A more amusing story is given in another purana.2 Having bloated his belly 3. Detail of Fig. 2 88</page><page sequence="5">4. Detail of Fig. 2 5. Detail of Fig. 2 S. Dealo i. 2 89</page><page sequence="6">with sweets, of which he was inordinately fond, Ganes'a was returning home on his mount, the mouse. On the way the poor mouse was frightened by a snake and threw his master to the ground. The fall burst open Ganes'a's belly and the sweetmeats fell out. Patiently, however, he refilled his stomach with them and secured it with the very snake that had caused the mishap. On seeing his plight the Moon began to laugh which enraged Ganes'a; he pulled out one of his tusks and hurled it at the moon. This story explains both his love for sweetmeats and the loss of his tusk. According to the Padmapurana,3 however, the modaka (sweetmeats) is the symbol of supreme knowledge (maha-bLiddhi). Ganes'a is flanked by two females, each holding a staff in her left hand, while the right displays the gesture of assurance (abhayamudra). As we shall see later, they represent Jaya and Vijaya, two of Uma's attendants, and here portrayed as guardians (pratih5ra). At the two extremities are two male figures, each of whom is four-armed. Both are given identical attributes, the upper right hand holding the rosary, the upper left the trident, the lower left the vase, while the lower right displays the abhayamudra. In all likelihood they are two attendant-guardians (pratihara) of Siva, although their exact identity is uncertain since the attributes in their hands do not quite follow the known textual descriptions of Siva's guardians. All these figures, as well as those of Sarasvati and Karttikeya above, are similarly attired and ornamented. On either side of the pedestal is a figure of a dancing male. The emaciated figure (Fig. 4) holding a trident raised above his head and a vase suspended from his arm is Bhrfigi, one of Siva's inseparable companions. The other (Fig. 5), potbellied, bearded, and rather fierce looking, is Kusmn.da, another of his companions.4 II Indian iconographic texts categorize this type of image as "Uma-Mahesvara-murtti."5 The earliest known text to describe such an image is the Visnudharmottarapurana, but more elaborate descriptions are found in medieval texts such as the Apara- jitaprccha or the Rupamandana. Both these texts state that Uma and Mahesvara should be portrayed together and that one of his arms should be caressing Uma, while one of hers should be placed around his neck. The three other hands of Mahesvara should hold the citrus fruit' (matuluniga), the trident, and the snake, while Uma holds a mirror. What is of further interest is that the texts also prescribe that below the couple should be portrayed Ganesa, Kumara, and the dancing Bhrngi with his emaciated body. A still more elaborate description of the image of Uma-Mahesvara occurs in the Matsyapurana.' According to this text the god should be either two- or four-armed; his attributes are the trident and the lotus, while one of his hands should be placed on Uma's breast. Uma should be seated on the god's left, sportively touching his left side and with her outstretched left hand holding either a mirror or a lotus. The text further relates that on both sides of Uma should be placed the images of Jaya, Vijaya, Karttikeya, and Gan.esa; and near the gateway should be shown the images of 90</page><page sequence="7">Guhyakas. There should also be images of the Vidyadharas wearing garlands and celestial nymphs playing musical instruments in standing postures. It would thus seem that the Matsyapurana description is the closest to the Nepali icon, although there are some differences. The Nepali artist has added the figure of Sarasvati and none of the known texts prescribes her inclusion. There are also some similarities with other textual versions, such as that in the Rupamandana, but it ap- pears that the Nepali artist followed a somewhat different iconographical tradition. III The popularity of the Uma-Mahesvara theme in Nepal is attested by the large number of reliefs distributed all over the valley. Usually these reliefs are stuck on the walls of water conduits. Two such reliefs are discussed here in comparison with the metal example. Generally, the metal icons are far less elaborate (Figs. 1 &amp; 6). Perhaps origi- nally these were also placed on pedestals with other subsidiary figures and acolytes. In the stele from Pharphing (Fig. 7) Mahesvara sits in exactly the same manner as he does in our metal image (Fig. 2), but the disposition of Uma is quite different. Instead of sitting in lalitasana and gazing into the face of her husband with a graceful tilt of the head, here she looks to the front as she reclines languidly against her hus- band's shoulder; an attendant supports her pendant foot. Siva's attributes are the rosary and the trident and in the majority of the Nepali reliefs he holds these two emblems. Perhaps the missing emblems in the metal image were the same. The bull, Nandi, is delineated as a powerful animal with a prominent hump, and Karttikeya, with a sword held upright in his left hand, is given a slightly potbellied figure. At about the same level as Siva's shoulder on either side is a guardian or pratiha-ra, the same two that are represented along the base of the metal icon (Fig. 3). Above the less elaborate halo are two celestial beings, the four-armed figure pouring water with her principal hands, while the other two hold the ends of the flying scarf. The other female is probably occupied in throwing flowers over the divine couple. They are flanked by two disks, representing the sun and the moon, and a liniga adorns the apex of the back slab. In the lower section of the stele are Ganes'a, Bhr'ngi, and a three-headed figure, all dancing to the music provided by the drummer and a cymbal player, both with animal heads. This is the most common iconography and compositional arrangement of such stone reliefs. As is clear in this example, the entire background is depicted as a moun- tain with highly stylized rocks, no doubt indicating the locale of the incident, the Himalayas. Although such reliefs were intended to be viewed as icons -hence the rigid frontality and symmetrical arrangement of the figures -their narrative intent is quite obvious. It appears that the occasion the sculptor chose to portray was that of the divine couple witnessing a dance performance by Gan.esa and other attendants of Siva. The rocky ledge below which they are dancing has been rendered quite realistically in depth so that we seem to be watching a performance on a stage. The stereotyped icons of Uma-Mahesvara were produced in large quantities in 91</page><page sequence="8">India during the medieval period. But the reliefs that betray the most obvious nar- rative intent are those in Ellora. Several large reliefs there (Fig. 8) show Uma and Mahesvara seated in various postures, surrounded by a number of divinities, and watching a performance by the Ganas and others. This immediately recalls the scene in Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava where, after their marriage, the two sit down together to witness a dramatic performance accompanied by both music and dancing.8 The Ellora panels were very likely inspired by these descriptive verses, and it is not impossible that the same idea is also behind the Nepali sculptures, although here the narrative intent is far less predominant than in Ellora. Stylistically, the Nepali reliefs share a number of common features with the Ellora panels. In both instances, the relief is divided into two sections, the per- formance taking place in the lower. The same stylized design of rocks is employed in both places to indicate the locale, although the Nepali artists have used it with greater abandon. We may mention, however, that this treatment of rocks is not peculiar to either area and is derived from older sources, such as Ajanta in painted versions and as far back as the Sanchi reliefs. Another common feature is the manner 6. Uma-Mahe'svara. Gilt-copper, Nepal, 14th century. Collection of Nalini and Haridas Swali of Bombay.

U ma-Mahesvara, Pharph ing, Nepal, late 1 5th centu ry. 93</page><page sequence="10">in which Uma is represented in the majority of the Nepali reliefs. She is shown seated sideways in a half-reclining posture, languidly resting against her husband's shoulder. This is not the usual method of portraying her in icons from northern India, but in Ellora she is shown in such a posture at least twice in the panels depict- ing Ravana rocking mount Kailasa (Fig. 9). Here also the motif can be traced back to more ancient reliefs such as the fragmentary stele from Pithalkhora (Fig. 10) where a fond couple is represented in dalliance. At any rate, there seems ample evidence to suggest that the Nepali artists were probably familiar with the Saiva shrines at Ellora and may well have been inspired by the gigantic reliefs there in their own attempts at portraying the "Uma-Mahesvara" theme. IV The central figures in another metal image, now in a private collection in Bombay (Fig. 6), are very similar to those in the recently acquired example in the Musuem (Fig. 2). The only differences are, apart from the less sumptuous ornamentation, the posture of Uma, who is seated on the lotus rather than on her husband's knee, and the fact that her right hand rests on his thigh instead of embracing his neck. In the other icon (Fig. 1) both are seated on the bull, Nandi, and, here also, although Uma sits in lalitasana, her right hand rests on Mahesvara's thigh. In both, however, she holds a lotus with her left hand. In fact, in almost all instances in Nepal Uma holds a lotus with her left hand, whereas in the northern Indian images she is more custom- 8.

We have already seen that the Matsyapurana prescribes both the attributes for the goddess. A slightly different iconography of the two principal figures may also be seen in another stele, stuck in a niche in the water conduit outside the main entrance to the famous temple of Kumbhesvara in Patan (Fig. 11). Both Mahesvara and Uma are seated in the yogic posture (yogasana), although Uma still sits on her husband's thigh. Each is also given four arms which are disposed in identical fashion. With the two principal hands each holds a vase, while the other two hands display the abhayamudra and the varadamudra. Their posture and the presence of the vase lead us to suggest that in this instance they are engaged in performing some ritual, per- haps in connection with their marriage. Another minor iconographic variation is that Uma's attendant is here portrayed as a guardian holding a sword and a shield. Along the base are two figures at the extremities, a bearded male seated with his palms enjoined and a kneeling female with her right hand raised in benediction. They are most likely the donors of the icon. The basic difference in the iconography of the principal figures would lead us to postulate that the artist here was following a different iconographic tradition. The majority of these Nepali reliefs, however, seem to follow one particular tradition, as is evident from two of the sculptures (Figs. 2 &amp; 7). Art historically what is of sig- nificance is that although the sculptors were following the same literary convention and perhaps even copying an original and sacred model, each relief shows certain 9.

Photo courtesy of University of Michigan Art Archives. 95</page><page sequence="12">differences, which could be attributed to the predilection of the artist attempting to demonstrate individualism. The sculptor of the Pharphing relief (Fig. 7), for instance, preferred to emphasize the locale of the incident by delineating the entire back slab as a rocky surface. And yet the treatment of the rocks itself reveals the conserva- tive as well as the conceptual character of the art. He also chose not to represent the lotus seat, and, both as a realistic touch and as appropriate to Siva, he has covered the rock seat with an animal skin. Indeed, his interest in realism is also evident in his treatment in depth of the receding ledge below which the Ganas are dancing. At the same time his sense of foreshortening in the flying four-armed celestial female is rather curious, although the other is rendered more naturalistically. In the Patan relief (Fig. 11) the two celestial females are portrayed in the more conventional and graceful manner, confronting each other and flying towards the 10. Seated couple. Pithalkhora, India, 1st century B.C., The National Museum, New Delhi. 96</page><page sequence="13">principal personages. The artist here was obviously more concerned with a stricter sense of symmetry and balance. He has also added an umbrella at the apex of the stele, evidently to emphasize the divinity of the seated couple, whereas the other sculptor has added a liniga, which seems redundant since Siva is already present in the image. While the artist of the Pharphing relief portrayed the two attendants of Siva identically, that of the Patan stele made one slightly more corpulent than the other. If again these reliefs are compared with others,' many such differences not only in details but also in the compositional scheme as well as the distribution of the figures become quite apparent. The arrangement of the figures in the metal icon (Fig. 2) was probably determined by the material. Casting the attendant figures on the aureole, as in the stone exam- ples, would have been complex and perhaps even visually cumbersome, and hence - k~~~~~~- ' ^- .. # 11. Uma-Mahesvara. Patan, Nepal, early 15th century. 97</page><page sequence="14">they were transferred to the base of the pedestal. Despite the strictly frontal and hieratic character of the icon, the figures are imbued with remarkable grace and animation. Symmetry is the keynote of the composition, but the entire sculpture is enlivened by the swirling form the floral design on the aureole. The delineation of the dancing figures of Bhrngi and Kusman.da (Figs. 4 &amp; 5) is particularly lively, but certainly the piece de resistance in the group is the figure of P5rvati. Her sensuous and supple form serves as a contrast to the more hieratic and dignified figure of Mahesvara. The artist seems to have purposefully given her body an elegant half twist to allow the intrinsic movement of her form to flow into that of Mahesvara. Equally animated is the bronze sculpture (Fig. 1), where the composition seems to be dominated by a circular flow of movement from the gracefully turned head of the bull through the curves of Siva's arms and then down the animal's back. This bronze is an exceptional instance in Nepal where the couple is shown seated on the bull. It thus becomes quite evident that at least in these examples the artist did not quite adhere to the more traditional mode as seen commonly in the stone reliefs. We are left in no doubt that despite the strict canonical injunctions, the artists often worked from visual models and did enjoy a limited freedom, in the actual execution of an object. V We have already stressed that in adopting this subject the Nepali artists may have been inspired directly by the Ellora panels rather than the more stereotyped icons of the medieval period from northern India. Yet the Nepali artists have given expression to the theme in their own characteristic manner. It is often claimed that the art of Nepal from about the ninth century was so strongly influenced by that of contempo- rary Bengal and Bihar that it is considered to be a more provincial version of the imperial Pala and Sena styles. A comparison of a Bengal sculpture (Fig. 12) repre- senting the same theme with the Nepali examples will reveal, however, the funda- mental stylistic differences of the two traditions. It may be stated generally that no relief or bronze is known from eastern India which shows quite the same iconography, compositional scheme, or narrative intent as the Nepali steles. Usually the images from eastern India seem to follow the Matsyapurana description even more closely than do the elaborate Nepali icons. In this particular bronze from Bengal we notice Siva fondly lifting Uma's face by touching her chin. This mode is not known in Nepal at all whereas it was rather popular with the artists of Bengal who were here following a different puranic tradition as shown by Bhattasali.'? Stylistically, it is evident that the Nepali sculptors followed altogether different canons of proportion. Whereas in the Pala sculptures the figures are slim with slender limbs and the modeling is more animated and taut, the Nepali figures are less attenuated and more softly modeled. The physiognomy of the figures in eastern Indian sculptures is characterized by an oval shape, sharp, well-articulated features, especially sharp noses and pointed chins, while the Nepali artists show a 98</page><page sequence="15">12.

Marianne Brimmer Fund. 21.1651 99</page><page sequence="16">preference for rounded facial types with less articulated features, often revealing a Mongoloid ethnic strain. Although it is not our intention here to deny altogether the influence of the Pala style on the art of Nepal, there seems little doubt that the Nepali artists treated the "Uma-Mahesvara" theme in their own distinctive way. Because of the extreme rigidity of the style, it is difficult to place these sculptures in a firm chronological context. Stella Kramrisch has published two such images, one in stone now standing in a water conduit in Nagal tole in Kathmandu, and another in metal in the Baroda Museum, and has dated them both in the eighth- ninth century." Based on stylistic considerations, however, there can be little doubt, that the Baroda image and the one in which the couple are seated on the bull (Fig. 1) are contemporaneous. A careful study of many other such reliefs in Nepal leads us to postulate a date not earlier than the fifteenth century for the example in the Mu- seum (Fig. 1); thus the Baroda bronze could hardly be older. An eighth-ninth century date for the Nagal tole relief also seems far too early, especially when compared with the solitary dated image in Patan'2 which, according to the inscription on the pedestal, was consecrated in 307 N.S./A.D. 1187. We are thus inclined to suggest a thirteenth century date both for the Nagal tole icon and for the newly acquired piece in the Museum (Fig. 2). The two stone reliefs probably belong to the fifteenth century, the Pharphing example (Fig. 7) being somewhat later than that from Patan (Fig.1 1). NOTES 1.
