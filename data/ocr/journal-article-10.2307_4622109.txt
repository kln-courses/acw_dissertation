ABSTRACT This study presents a content analysis of sexual portrayals in magazine advertisements during 1964 and 1984. The results show that the percentage of ads with sexual content did not increase over the twenty-year period, but that the types of sexual portrayals did; sexual illustrations became more overt; and there was a greater reliance on visual than verbal sex in 1984 than 1964. The study also found that female models are more likely to be portrayed as sexually clad, partially clad or nude than were male models. Received April 1, 1986. Accepted for publication June 6, 1986. The use of sex in advertising has been a source of controversy among consumers and practitioners for over a decade (18, 20). The controversy has recently intensified, perhaps because of a percep- tion that there is an increased use of sexually provoc- ative and suggestive content in advertisements. Sciglimpaglia, et. al. (11), for example, report that a "trend toward an increasing use of sex in advertising can hardly be disputed." In 1985, Women Against Pornography, an activist organization, issued "Plastic Pig" awards to ads it deemed pornographic (1). Marketers have also examined the use of sex in advertising (17). One marketer described several recent lingerie advertisements as lacking "good judgement in displaying tasteless, vulgar and pro- vocative ads which belong more appropriately in a pornographic magazine" than the mass media (10). Previous studies of the portrayal of models in advertising have focused on the way in which women's roles have been portrayed (4, 12, 21). Research has been shifting from role portrayals to the use of explicit sexual content in advertise- ments. One of the earliest studies on the effectiveness of explicitly sexual messages was conducted by Steadman (15). Steadman found that fewer brand names were correctly recalled when accompanied by sexual illustrations. Research by Alexander and Judd (2) substantiated Steadman's findings. In addition, a longitudinal study conducted by Weller, et. al. (22), found an inverse correlation between erotic content and recall rates. In a study of cognitive responses to sex in advertising, Belch, et. al. (3), found that respondents were more likely to evaluate advertisements with nudes as more offensive than other advertisements. This was particularly true of female respondents, although the respondents did find partially clad models appealing and interesting. Overall, the empirical research suggests that sexual content in advertising is less effective than non- sexual content. Paradoxically, it has been suggested that sexual depictions in advertisements have in- creased rather than decreased since these studies were published. Although substantial research has examined the effectiveness of sexually-oriented appeals, little research examined the actual use of sex in adver- tising. A content analysis (8) of television commer- cials used a cross-cultural sample of Clio Award- winning television commercials to determine the similarities and differences in the use of sex in American and international television advertisements. The study found that less than 7.7 percent of U.S. television commercials contained anything other than fully dressed models, and only 0.5 percent depicted partially clad models. Overall, it was found that nudity was more common in international than American advertising. Soley and Reid (14) studied "baiting" (i.e., the link between advertisers and ? JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING, Vol. 15, No. 3, 1986 46</page><page sequence="2">audiences in which the sexual content of television program advertisements brought the audience and station together). They found that over 35 percent of print ads for television programs contained sexual elements. It is doubtful, however, whether these findings can be generalized to consumer product advertising. The purpose of this study is to generate a system- atic analysis of the sexual content of magazine advertisements published during 1964 and 1984. By comparing different years, it can be determined whether the quantity of sex in current advertisements differs from that appearing previously. The study concentrates on the use of explicit sexual content, which has been the actual source of controversy. Specifically, the study examines the degree of dress and undress of models portrayed in ads and the proximity of male and female models (i.e., whether they are touching and the degree of contact). The headlines in the advertisements were also analyzed to determine the quantity of verbal sexual references. "Subliminal" and "symbolic" sex, although dis- cussed in the literature on sex in advertising (6, 9), were not coded in this study because they do not represent forms of overt sexual depictions. This study compares the amount and types of overt sexuality in magazine advertisements during two different periods - 1964, a period prior to the "sexual revolution" and 1984, a period following the sexual revolution. Although there are indications that sexual conservatism has increased in the last few years (7), there is no question that social attitudes toward sex and sexuality are less conservative in the 1980s than the 1960s. A longitudinal study con- ducted by Jedlicka and Robinson (5) found that sexual behaviors and attitudes changed significantly between 1965 and 1980. For example, 28.7 percent of female college students reported having premarital intercourse in 1965 compared to 63.5 percent in 1980. Seventy percent of the 1965 sample felt that premarital intercourse was immoral, compared to 25.3 percent in 1980. Whether advertising reflects these changes in sexual behaviors and norms is not known. METHOD Sample Selection and Procedure The sample consisted of 1,698 full-page and larger advertisements that appeared in 1964 and 1984 issues of general-interest, women's and men's maga- zines. Overall, 586 advertisements were obtained from 1964 issues and 1,112 advertisements were obtained from 1984 issues of the magazines. Time and Newsweek were the general-interest magazines from which advertisements were selected. The weekly news magazines were the largest circu- lation news magazines published in 1964 and 1984. Cosmopolitan and Redbook were the women's magazines from which ads were selected. As with the general-interest magazines, both women's maga- zines were published during 1964 and 1984. Playboy and Esquire comprised the men's magazines from which ads were selected. Playboy and Esquire are the largest circulation men's magazines published in 1964 and 1984. With the exception of the 1964 issues of Cosmo- politan, every full-page and larger advertisement in three randomly selected 1964 and 1984 issues were content analyzed. The issues that were included in the sample were randomly selected using a table of random digits, with the selected digits corre- sponding to the months (and weeks) to be used. Numbers 1, 7, and 11, for example, were selected for the 1964 issues of Esquire, so that all full-page and larger advertisements in the January, July and November issues were analyzed. Because the 1964 issues of Cosmopolitan contained few full-page and larger advertisements, averaging ten advertise- ments per issue, advertisements from ten 1964 issues were included in the sample. This increased the number of advertisements obtained from the 1964 issues of Cosmopolitan to 102. The sexual content in each of the sampled adver- tisements was coded by two trained coders who worked independently. The training consisted of providing each coder with the content categories and definitions and, following a discussion of what was and was not included in each category, having the coders independently analyze advertisements in a pretest sample. The pretest sample consisted of advertisements appearing in 1970s issues of Sports Illustrated and U.S. News. After independently coding these advertisements, the coders compared results and discussed potential problems. Following the discussions, the content categories and defini- tions were refined and a different pretest sample content analyzed. This procedure was repeated until high intercoder reliability was obtained. Intercoder reliability was tested by calculating agreement coef- ficients. Agreement coefficients, unlike correlation coefficients, control for incidence frequency and one- sided agreement and are considered superior measures of intercoder reliability for content analysis. Several computational formulas for the agreement coefficient exist, depending on the scale type of the particular content category being analyzed. Agreement coef- ficients range from +1.0 to -1.0, where +1.0 indicates perfect agreement and 0.0 indicates agreement due to chance alone. A coefficient of .75 indicates that intercoder reliability is 75 percent above the level expected by chance. Agreement coefficients 47</page><page sequence="3">above .80 are considered unconditionally reliable; items with coefficients between .60 and .80 are accepted as conditionally reliable; while items below .60 are considered to be unreliable. All agreement coefficients calculated for the final pretest sample exceeded .75. Coding Units The coding units consisted of the presence or absence of discernable adult models in the ad illustra- tions, whether photograph, drawing or sketch. A number of advertisements, particularly for auto- mobiles, contained "long shots" where the gender of the driver was indiscernable. These ads were coded as not containing discernable adult models. Ads containing only hands or feet were also coded as not containing discernable adult models. All ads without illustrations, portraying only children or the product alone were coded as not containing discernable adult models. The agreement coefficient calculated for this bivariate coding unit was .98. Advertisements containing discernable adult models were coded by the presence and gender of the models in the ads (i.e., whether the advertisements contained only female models, only male models or both genders). The agreement coefficient cal- culated for this coding unit was .96. When male and female models were portrayed together in an advertisement, the ad was content analyzed for the presence of physical contact between males and females. The ads were coded according to whether or not at least one male and female in the ad were in physical contact. Ads where males and females were in physical contact were initially coded into two categories: 1) displaying simple contact such as holding hands or 2) where contact was more intimate. More intimate contact included kissing, embracing, playful "wrestling" and where the arm of at least one model was around the body of the other. The calculated agreement coefficient for this category was .89. The ads containing males and females were finally content analyzed for their suggestion or depiction of intercourse, using the definition employed by Soley and Reid (13, 14). Advertisements showing males and females em- bracing in a prone position, embracing while par- tially clad or nude, together in bed or depicting other bedroom scenes were coded as portraying intercourse. Ads so coded included a fragrance ad which portrayed a partially clad male and female model in a prone embrace and an advertisement for a major hotel chain. The hotel advertisement portrayed a female model in lingerie, with a male model looking at her. The bedroom and bed were visible in the background. The agreement coefficient calculated for this category was .82. All advertisements containing adult models were coded for the degree of dress/undress of the por- trayed models, using the categories developed by Reid, et. al. (8): demure, seductive, partially clad and nude. Demure dress is defined as typical dress, including tennis skirts and walking shorts. Seductive dress includes open blouses and shirts which expose chest areas; mini-skirts; "short shorts"; tight clothing which accentuates the figure or middle inseam of trousers; full-length lingerie, except where trans- luscent; evening gowns which expose cleavage; "muscle shirts"; and hiked skirts, exposing thighs. Partially clad models are defined as wearing bathing suits; underapparel and three-quarter length or shorter lingerie, except where translucent; "close- ups," where the shoulders of the models are bare; and photographs or illustrations of legs which include the thigh, but display no clothing. Nudity is defined as unclothed bodies, including silhouettes; the wearing of transluscent underapparel or lingerie; "medium shots," where the models display no clothing or have only a towel over their shoulders; and full shots where the model is unclad except for a towel. The agreement coefficient calculated for degree of dress/undress was .79. The headlines of all advertisements, including those not containing discernable adult models, were content analyzed for verbal sexual references. Verbal sexual references include mentions of nudity; love- making; breasts, except in reference to breast cancer; contraception; mentions of lifestyles suggestive of sexual activity (such as "swinging singles" or "play- boy lifestyle"); and the use of words such as "volup- tuous," "foxy," "playmates," and "romance." References to "pleasure" accompanying photographs accompanying cross-gender contact and common sexual phrases (e.g., "Not tonight, Dear," "A great body," "Bigger is better") were coded as containing verbal sexual references. Allusions to the comfort, feel or fit of underapparel and feminine napkin advertisements were not coded as containing sexual references. The agreement coefficient calculated for verbal sexual references was .77. RESULTS Advertisements containing verbal sexual references, those depicting male/female contact and portraying suggestively clad, partially clad and nude models were coded as containing sexual content. Of the 586 advertisements appearing in 1964, 103 (17.6 %) were coded as containing sexual content (see Table 1). Of the 1,112 advertisements appearing in 1984, 254 (22.8%) contained sexual content. The results indicate a slight increase in the use of sexual content in advertisements between 1964 and 48</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 1 FREQUENCY OF SEXUAL CONTENT IN ADVERTISING BY MAGAZINE TYPE AND YEAR 1964 General Total Interest Men's Women's (All Magazines Magazines Magazines Magazines) without with without with without with adult models adult models adult models adult models adult models adult models no 80 122 57 79 79 66 483 sexuality (38.6%) (58.9%) (30.8%) (42.7%) (40.7%) (34.0%) (82.4%) containing 0 5 2 47 1 48 103 sexuality (0%) (2.4%) (1.1%) (25.4%) (0.5%) (24.7%) (17.6%) N=207 N= 185 N=194 N=586 1984 no 134 110 168 120 157 169 858 sexuality (48.6%) (39.9%) (43.0%) (30.7%) (35.3%) (38.0%) (77.2%) containing 2 30 2 101 4 115 254 sexuality (0.7%) (10.8%) (0.5%) (25.8%) (0.9%) (25.8%) (22.8%) N=276 N=391 N=445 N=1112 1984, but the difference was not significant (dif- ference between two proportions test; Z = 1.86). (Only Z values exceeding 1.96 are significant at p&lt;.05.) As can be observed from Table 1, relatively few advertisements without adult models (N64 = 3; N84 = 8) contained sexual content. All of the adver- tisements without adult models contained verbal rather than visual sexual content, with the most frequent use of sex being the description of a product in anthropomorphic, sexual terms. For example, a camera advertisement in a general-interest magazine described the product as having "a great little body with stunning features." Anthropomorphic descrip- tions were also present in automobile advertisements. Another advertisement touted the product as "for mature audiences only." Table 1 also presents the use of sexual content by magazine type. As Table 1 shows, advertisements containing sexual content were more prevalent in men's and women's magazines than in general-interest magazines. This is particularly true for 1964, when only 2.4 percent of general-interest magazine ads contained sexual content. Over 26 percent of the ads in 1964 men's magazines (i.e., 1.1% and 25.4%) and over 25 percent of ads in 1964 women's maga- zines contained sexual content. Significantly fewer sexual ads appeared in 1964 general-interest magazines than in men's (Z = 6.91) or women's magazines (Z = 6.71). The same was true of the 1984 advertisements. Just over 11 percent of general- interest magazine ads contained sexual content, whereas 26.3 percent of the advertisements in men's magazines and 26.7 percent of the advertisements in women's magazines contained sexual content. The percentage of sexual advertisements in 1984 men's magazines was significantly greater than in 1984 general-interest magazines (Z = 4.77). Although general-interest magazines contained significantly fewer sexual advertisements than did men's or women's magazines, the use of sexual advertisements in general-interest magazines did increase between 1964 and 1984. Only 2.4 percent of 1964 general- interest ads contained sexual content, compared to 11.5 percent in 1984. The difference between the percentages is statistically significant (Z = 3.72). Although the sexual content of advertisements in general-interest magazines increased between 1964 and 1984, no comparable increase was found among ads in men's and women's magazines. During 1964, 49 of the 185 advertisements (26.5%) in men's magazines contained sexual content; during 1984, 103 of the 391 ads (26.3%) contained sexual content. Of advertisements in 1964 women's magazines, 25.2 percent contained sexual content, compared with 26.7 percent in 1984. Moreover, men's and 49</page><page sequence="5">women's magazines were found to contain similar percentages of ads with sexual content in 1964 as well as 1984. Of the 639 advertisements appearing in women's magazines during 1964 and 1984, 168 (26.3%) contained sexual content. Of the 576 adver- tisements appearing in men's magazines, 152 (26.4%) contained sexual content. Advertisers have been remarkably even-handed when using sexual content for appeals in men's and women's magazines. Despite the equality in the quantity of sexually oriented ads in men's and women's magazines, the type of sexual content could differ. The type of sexual content portrayed in ads is examined below. Table 2 presents a breakdown of verbal and visual sexual content by magazine type and year. As can be observed from the table, proportionately more 1984 ads relied on visual sex than did 1964 advertisements. During 1964, 72 of the 103 sexually-oriented ads (69.9%) contained just visual sexual content, whereas 201 of the 254 ads (79.1%) appearing in 1984 con- tained only visual sexual content. Conversely, 12 of the 1964 advertisements (11.7%) contained verbal sexual references, compared to 14 of 254 ads (5.5%) in 1984. This suggests that there has been an increase in the use of visual sex, with a proportionate decrease in the use of only verbal sexual references between 1964 and 1984. Advertisements relied more on visual sex in 1984 than in 1964. Although true across all magazine types, the increased reliance on visual sexual depictions is particularly observable among general-interest magazines.

That is, 40 percent of the 1964 general-interest magazine ads contained only verbal sexual references, compared to 9.4 percent in 1984. Table 2 also shows that sexual illustrations are usually not accom- panied with a sexual headline. Seventy-two of the 1964 advertisements contained visual sex; only 19 combined the visual with a sexual headline. Table 3 presents the frequency and types of visual sexual portrayals in the advertisements. The sexual dress/undress category includes suggestively clad, partially clad and nude portrayals. The male/female content category includes portrayals of models holding hands, touching, embracing, kissing and ads suggesting intercourse. (Refinements of these categories are presented in Tables 4 and 5.) Ads were coded as containing "both" when male/female contact was present in combination with suggestively clad, partially clad or nude models. The table includes 50</page><page sequence="6">advertisements that contained only visual sexual content and those which combined visual and verbal sexual references. Of the 207 advertisements appearing in the 1964 general-interest magazines, 127 contained adult models. Of the 127 ads with models, only three con- tained visual sexual content. Two (1.6%) depicted models that exhibited other than demure dress and one (0.8%) contained male and female models exhibiting other than demure dress while making physical contact. As indicated earlier, this is signi- ficantly less than exhibited in men's and women's magazines. Men's and women's magazines tended to portray sexually dressed and undressed models with greater frequency than general-interest maga- zines. Among the categories of visual content, sexual dress/undress was the most frequent visual portrayal. In the overall 1964 sample of 367 ads containing adult models, 70 (19.1%) contained sexually dressed or undressed models. Twelve portrayed male/female contact, and nine contained both types of visual portrayals. The differences between these frequencies are significant (X2 = 77.97; d.f. = 2, p&lt;.001). The differences between the frequencies of the 1984 sample are also significant (X2 = 103.8; d.f. = 2; p&lt;.001). The chi-square tests show that advertise- ments more frequently depict sexual dress/undress than male/female contact or both visuals. While appearing more frequently than other visual depictions, sexual dress/undress is somewhat more frequently depicted in women's than men's magazines. One-third of the ads containing adult models in 1964 women's magazines depicted sexually dressed or undressed models, while less than one- fourth of the ads in 1964 men's magazines did. The percentages, however, do not differ significantly (Z = 1.63). A similarly high percentage of ads in 1984 women's magazines (34.2%) depicted sug- gestively clad, partially clad or nude models. On the other hand, ads in men's magazines tended to depict male/female contact with greater frequency than did women's magazines. Although this was true for 1964 and 1984 advertisements, it was more pronounced among the 1984 sample. Twenty-five advertisements in 1984 men's magazines depicted male/female contact and another 20 depicted male/female contact in combination with sexual dress or undress (i.e., "both"). The 45 ads represent over 20 percent of all ads containing discernable adult models. Less than seven percent of the 1984 women's magazine ads portrayed male/female con- tact. The percentages differ significantly (Z = 4.74). The categories and frequencies of male/female contact are presented in Table 4. As shown by the table, 119 advertisements in the sample of 1964 advertisements contained adult male and female TABLE 4 TYPES OF MALE/FEMALE CONTACT IN ADVERTISEMENTS 1964 General Total Interest Men's Women's (All Magazines Magazines Magazines Magazines) Holding 0 6 1 7 Hands (0%) (13.0%) (3.4%) (5.9%) Other Contact 1 6 4 11 (Short of (2.3%) (13.0%) (13.8%) (9.2%) Intercourse) Intercourse 0 2 1 3 (0%) (4.3%) (3.4%) (2.5%) Total Ads Containing Both Genders 44 46 29 119 1984 Holding 5 9 4 18 Hands (11.4%) (9.4%) (6.0%) (8.7%) Other Contact 7 31 11 49 (Short of (15.9%) (32.3%) (16.4%) (23.7%) Intercourse) Intercourse 1 5 3 9 (2.3%) (5.2%) (4.5%) (4.3%) Total Ads Containing Both Genders 44 96 67 207 models. Of these, seven showed the models holding hands; eleven showed the models embracing, kissing or making other contact; three depicted scenes suggestive of intercourse. (Note: these categories are discrete and hierarchical. An ad showing a par- tially clad couple embracing in bed would be counted only once - as depicting intercourse. It would not also be counted in the "other contact" category.) The 21 ads from 1964 depicting male/female contact constitute 17.6 percent of the ads portraying males and females together. Conversely, 98 of the 1964 ads (82.4%) portraying male and female models together exhibit no physical contact. The over- whelming majority of the 1964 ads that depict both genders contain no sexual suggestions, or, if they do, contain very subtle suggestions.

Many more 1984 ads depicted cross-gender contact. Of the 207 ads containing both males and females, 76 depicted male/female contact. Of these, 18 showed the models holding hands; 49 displayed other physical contact; nine were coded as sug- gestive of intercourse. These ads comprise 36.7 percent of the 1984 ads which contain male and fe- male models. A difference-between-proportions test found that the amount of male/female contact depicted in 1984 ads was significantly greater than depicted in 1964 ads (Z = 3.63). The most frequent type of male/female contact in 1964 and 1984 ads was embracing, touching and other contact more intimate than holding hands. This was true across all magazine classifications and years, except 1964 men's magazines. In 1964 men's magazine ads, holding hands occurred as frequently as hugging, kissing, "wrestling" and other contact. Six ads in the 1964 men's magazines showed couples holding hands, and six ads depicted 52</page><page sequence="8">other sexual contact. Intercourse was suggested in very few of the sample ads. Of the 326 ads which contained both genders, only 12 (3.7%) were coded as containing intercourse. Of the 1,698 advertise- ments comprising the total sample, the 12 ads com- prised less than one percent. Table 5 presents the degree of dress/undress of the models by gender. Because the table is already complex, the breakdowns are not presented by magazine classification (general, women's and men's), as was done in previous tables. The breakdown by magazine classification is not presented to avoid undue complexity. (Readers wishing to obtain tables that present the type of dress/undress by model gender and magazine classification may contact the authors.) Of the ads appearing in 1964 magazines, 367 contained adult models. Of the ads that contained adult models, 113 portrayed only female models, 135 portrayed only male models, and 119 portrayed models of both genders. Of the 113 ads portraying only female models, 15 contained suggestively clad models. The 15 ads represent 13.3 percent of all 1964 ads containing only female models. Twenty ads (17.7%) portrayed partially clad female models and 12 (10.6%) portrayed nude models. When the suggestively clad, partially clad and nude categories are combined, it shows that 47 of the 113 ads (41.6%) portrayed female models in other than demure dress. This can be contrasted with the frequency of non-demure dress in ads portraying only males. Only 5 of the 135 ads (3.7%) portraying male models alone contained non-demure dress. During 1964, female models were much more frequently shown to be suggestively clad, partially clad or nude than were male models. This finding is also observed in the 1984 sample. Almost 41 percent of the ads containing only female models depicted sexual dress or undress, whereas 15.3 percent of ads containing male models did. Although 1984 ads were more likely to depict sexually clad males than were 1964 ads, the percentage is far below that observed in the sample of ads containing only female models. When males and females were portrayed in the same ad, the female models were more frequently portrayed in various stages of undress than were the males. Of the 119 ads from 1964 that portrayed males and females together, 22 depicted a sexually dressed or undressed female in the presence of a fully clothed male. Not one ad showed a partially clad or nude male in the presence of a fully-clothed female. However, four ads did contain partially clad males and females together, and one contained a nude male and female. The same was true of 1984 ads, except that male models showed a little more "skin." One of the 1984 ads containing models of both genders depicted a suggestively clad male in the presence of a demurely dressed female; four showed partially clad males in the presence of fully dressed females. One explanation for the high frequency of sug- gestively clad females, relative to the number of suggestively clad male models, is that female dress is typically more "suggestive" than male dress. When males and females are formally dressed, the male model will usually be wearing a suit or tuxedo. Evening gowns, particularly on the female models portrayed in the content-analyzed ads, exposed cleavage. In advertisements, as real life, one rarely encounters a tuxedo-clad male whose shirt is unbut- toned and open. Although this can account for the high frequency of suggestively clad female models and the low frequency of suggestively clad male models, it cannot account for the differences among the partially clad and nude categories by gender. In advertisements, females are more frequently depicted while partially clad or nude than are males. In real life, males are as likely to wear bathing suits, take showers, or be nude as females, but are only rarely depicted this way in ads. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study show that: 1) the percentage of ads with sexual content has remained constant, but the absolute number of ads, including ads containing sexual elements, has increased in the average issue of the studied magazines during the twenty-year time interval; 2) general-interest magazines have shown a marked increase in sexually oriented ads but women's and men's magazines have not; 3) sexual illustrations have become more overt; 4) when sexual elements are present they are more likely to be visual than verbal and that this tendency has increased over time; 5) female models are more likely to be portrayed as suggestively clad, partially clad or nude than male models. The perception that there has been a recent increase in the use of sexual elements in advertising appears to be widespread, although it isn't so. The results of this content analysis suggest some expla- nations for the perception. It may be due to the increase in sexual content in general-interest maga- zine ads. The view may be based solely on the ads in this one magazine type. Another explanation is that the perception is based on the absolute increase in the use of sexually oriented ads that accompanied the increase in overall magazine adver- tising. Although men's and women's magazines contained proportionately the same number of sexually oriented ads in 1964 as 1984, the absolute 53</page><page sequence="9">number of ads with sexual content increased. Simply stated, the perceptions may reflect the absolute increase while not considering the overall increase in the number of advertisements. Another explanation is that sex in advertising has become more overt. The use of sexual illustra- tions containing nudes and suggestive of intercourse has increased. The amount of male/female contact in ads has tripled between 1964 and 1984. It may be that individuals correctly perceive an increase in overt sexuality in advertisements while neglecting the other types of sexual content that have histori- cally been found in advertisements. This explanation, and the others, are speculative and need to be examined by other research. The data also indicate that female models are far more likely to be less demurely dressed than male models, even in the same ad. This finding supports the complaint voiced by some feminist critics that sexism exists in advertising. A reason for the more frequent sexual depiction of female than male models may be that male perceptions dominate the industry. (Although this cannot be empirically substantiated, a study by Surlin (16) provides some support for the assertion. Surlin obtained three times as many survey responses from male as opposed to female advertising practitioners. The male practitioners were significantly more likely to agree that the use of "sex appeals" in advertising is socially responsible than were female practitioners.) The study by Belch, et. al. (3), which examined differences in male and female consumer evaluations of advertisements with sexual content, supports the contention that male rather than female viewpoints tend to dominate advertising. The study found that males find ads containing partially nude females more appealing than ads containing partially nude males. The reverse was true of the female subjects. Female subjects found ads with partially nude males to be more appealing and interesting than ads with partially nude females. Despite this preference, female consumers are more likely to be exposed to ads containing suggestive, partially clad or nude females than males, although this has changed some over the years. Finally, the apparent return to more conservative values during the 1980s may make sex in advertising more conspicuous than in previous times. A recent National Opinion Research survey reported that there has been an increase over the past four years in the number of people who believe pre-marital sex to be immoral. Surveys have also shown that opposition to sex education in public schools has increased, as has opposition to pornography (7). The survey results suggest a growing sexual conservatism among Americans. Whether this growing conservatism is responsible for the perception that sex in adver- tising has increased should become part of the agenda in advertising research. REFERENCES 1.
