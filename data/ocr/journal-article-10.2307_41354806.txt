<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anatomical Foundations of Tommaso Campanélla's Theory of Magic Guido Giglioni * Abstract: The aim of this article is to examine some of the anatomical implications of Campanellas theory of magic, focusing in particular on his critique of Aristotle's and Galen's anatomical views. By magic Campanella meant first and foremost communication of energy and knowledge. It is no accident that he viewed both medicine and rhetoric as constitutive disciplines of magic. In doing so, he appealed to the time-honoured notion of the magic of the word theorised in ancient times by the sophist Górgias. The distinctive feature in Campanellas system of magic is that the word is both a symbolic and a physical entity. Meaning flows from nature to the mind and from the mind to nature. Words are both earners of meanings and physical agents of psychosomatic transformation. As can be demonstrated by pointing to such paradigmatic cases as natural divination and prophecy, the force of the imagination, the patient's trust in the power of the physician or the healer, and the many influences that air exercises on the body, Campanellas theory of magic rests on a definite anatomo-physiological basis. The most original aspect, though, is the way in which Campanella reinterpreted Arìstotle's and Galen's prìnciples of anatomy so that he could adapt his medical views to the broader framework of his theory of magic (practice), on the one hand, and metaphysics (theory), on the other. In addition, Campanellas original account of emotions and passions supported a comprehensive system of magical practice that dispensed with the basic principles of both Aristotle's and Galen's physiology. Campanella was convinced that the vital operations of the body could not be explained by simply relying on the unsentient functions of the vegetative soul (Aristotle) or on the natural faculties of the body (Galen), nor could they be accounted for by assuming the existence of incorporeal souls (Arìstotle) or bodily temperaments (Galen). By circumventing both Aristotle's hylomorphism and Galen's vital materialism of the temperaments, and by appropriating the Stoic view of rational pneuma, he managed to produce a physiological model that was more flexible in dealing with the complex interplay of knowledge, action and appetite, and above all, better suited to account fora universe in which the flow of life and meaning encompassed varìous levels of communication. Keywords: natural magic, medicine , rhetoric, passions, perception. * Warburg Institute of the University of London Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 -Fase. 1 • 2010 9-24</page><page sequence="2">10 I Guido Giglioni The time practice Italian interest can philosopher be in found medicine. Tommaso throughout While Campanella references his works, (1568-1639) to it medical was not theory had until a 1635 life- and time interest in medicine. While references to medical theory and practice can be found throughout his works, it was not until 1635 that he published a whole treatise specifically devoted to medicine, the Medicinalium libri. In this book, relying on both metaphysical tenets (above all, the principle of the universal sentience of nature) and aspects of popular medicine (dealing with, among other things, magnetic cures, enchantments, textual amulets and iatromusic), he conducted a severe critique of Aristotles and Galen s models of physiology.1 There is a close relationship between magic and physiology in Campanellas system of knowledge. The magical component in his medical project is stated in the very proem' to his Medicinalium libri : 'Medicine is a form of magical practice (i quaedam magica praxis) that acts on man insofar as he is liable to fall ill. To restore health, therefore, is the subject and aim of medicine. The physician must know man as a whole and each single part of him, and all the causes and circumstances by which he is helped and damaged, both in general and in the individual cases'.2 Campanella was of the opinion that a comprehensive account of the organs and vital functions of the body was of essence to understand the nature and efficacy of magical operations. It is not that, by elaborating a magical view of the cosmos, Campanella assumed, by default as it were, that such a cosmos was alive and therefore to be studied as one living organism. The connection that Campanella established between magic and anatomy was more complex and it had to do with his view of magic as a fully-fledged theory of communication affecting varying levels of life and knowledge in the universe. In this article I will examine some of the anatomical implications of Campanellas theory of magic, focusing in particular on his critique of Aristotle's and Galen's anatomical views. Campanella countered the Galenic thesis of a tripartite division of the organs of the soul and their respective spheres of influence with his view of a unitary sentient spirit, capable of knowing, reacting 1 On Campanellas medicine, see Firpo, Luigi - Ricerche campanelliane.

However, the tripartite division, which was ruled out from an anatomical point of view, was acknowledged at the level of the metaphysical description of reality. Campanella s metaphysics is based on a tripartite division of being into three fundamental attributes, which he called 'primalities of being' (primalitates essendi), that is, power (posse), knowledge ( nosse ) and appetite ( velie )è Campanella maintained that all aspects of reality have a triadic structure insofar as they all are active, perceive and have primordial tendencies to preserve their being.3 He then applied the same triadic pattern to the domain of anatomy and physiology in order to describe the life of the body. The body, in Campanella s view, had three basic principles: the principle of knowledge (&lt; cognoscitivum ), the principle of power (potestativum ) and the principle of desire (appetitivum). One might look at the apparent discrepancy in Campanellas system of knowledge between anatomo-physiology and metaphysics as a speculative gimmick to have both the cake and eat it too, as it were - that is, to explain a certain transition between energy, knowledge and desire in the faculties of the body while at the same time maintaining the unity of the life of the body, i.e., the one active, sentient and desiring spirit. Or maybe, rather than assuming that Campanella was merely reinterpreting the Galenic (and through Galen the Platonic) tripartite division of the three orders of life in a philosophical fashion, we should look at Campanellas decision to divide the notion of being into the domains of energy, knowledge and desire and his characterisation of life as a seamless current of material spirit as an attempt to reconcile Bernardino Telesios vital materialism (which after all represents the starting point of Campanellas philosophical career) with the ontological platform of Thomistic philosophy. One should not forget that Campanella was a Dominican and that he eagerly imbibed Aquinas' version of Aristotelianism during the years of his youthful studies. In matters of natural philosophy and philosophical anthropology, Campanella identified the soul with the material spirit, i.e., a warm and extremely thin substance, in a perpetual state of motion and change. Because of its inherently responsive nature, he thought that the spirit was able to feel all the changes induced on it by external phenomena and events. Such a spirituous substratum was seen as able to take on and assimilate ( infarsi , in the Italian vernacular) every passion. 'The spirit perceives the things, knows them by touching them lightly (toccandole dolcemente) and it is changed by them to the extent that it can discern their forces'.4 Following the already mentioned metaphysical scheme of the primalities of being, Campanella described the 3 See Giglioni, Guido - 'Primalità'.

The spirit is material, mobile and shining'.6 Despite the central place that the notion of spirit occupied in his natural philosophy, Campanella never agreed with the prevailing (roughly Galenic) anatomical position at the time whereby living organisms endowed with liver, heart and brain had three different sorts of spirits, i.e., natural, vital and animal. For Campanella the spirit was one, its seat was to be found in the head, while other key organs such as the heart and the liver were simply workshops' (i officinae ) assigned to the production of spirit. He acknowledged two basic differences in relation to the nature and functions of the spirit. One was between 'free' and 'implanted' spirit, where 'free' meant freely circulating throughout the body and in charge of the voluntary functions, and 'implanted' meant resident in the various organs and above all in their fibres, from where they ruled the vegetative and involuntary operations.7 The other decisive difference concerned the existence of various levels of energy and awareness. In Campanella's anatomy, the distinction between voluntary and natural functions was simply due to varying degrees of intensity in one continuous stream of life and perception.8 Campanella aimed his specific criticisms of Aristotle's and Galen's anatomical at the way they had explained the main divisions of labours within the economy of the vital faculties. Aristotle had introduced a sharp division between the vegetative and the sensitive soul, while Galen had reduced the faculties of the soul to the various temperaments of the organs (liver, heart and brain). In contrast to both views, Campanella argued that each part of the body had the power to perceive. 'Nerves, bones, spirit, blood and stomach', he wrote in the Epilogo magno, a summa of natural philosophy in vernacular, 'all have a specific ability to perceive, in a more or less clear manner'.9 In his Medicinalium libri, rejecting the Aristotelian and Galenic view that not all the parts of the body were able to perceive and react, Campanella extended perception to all the components of the body, with the caveat, though, that 5 Campanella - Medicinalium libri, p. 7. 6 Campanella - Epilogo magno, p. 394.

In Campanella s opinion, this was the only reason why the mind was not always aware of local perceptions.10 He ruled out any difference of nature between sentient and unsentient perceptions, voluntary and involuntary operation, reactive and inert tendencies. Rather, within a whole system of nature that was seen as uniformly reactive and perceptive, he posited forms of communication occurring among varying levels of knowledge. But not only did Campanella criticise the horizontal, as it were Aristotelian, division into sentient and unsentient operations of the soul. He also rejected the vertical 'Galenic' division (of a Platonic origin) between appetite, energy and sentience.11 In the final analysis, he was of the opinion that both the Aristotelian and Galenic views of the body were unable to explain any form of communication between the physiological operations of the body, the perceptions of the mind and the motions of the passions. In addition to this general criticism, he also had more specific reservations against Aristotles and Galen's positions. Roughly speaking, we may say that the main difficulty he found in Aristotles anatomo-physiological account had to do with the thesis of the incorporeity of the soul, while in Galen s case, he rejected his alleged thesis of the corporeity of the soul (il temperamento grosso e stupido). In his critique of Aristotelian metaphysics and natural philosophy, Campanella thought that Aristotle's most untenable assumption was his view of nature as an indifferent and unintentional power, teleologically and unflinchingly driven towards the actualisation of an original potentiality, but almost mechanical in the way in which it fulfilled its natural ends. To the Aristotelian view of nature, Campanella objected that there could be no motion without perception and affect. In his opinion, the Aristotelian cosmos, even without endorsing the atomistic picture of a universe ruled by arbitrary chance and random movements of material corpuscles, ended nevertheless by hinging on a notion of life as meaningless activity. The way Aristotle had arrived at the idea of a meaningless cosmos was somehow subtler than the one followed by the atomists. Under the veneer of a teleological and harmonious arrangement of the universe there lied the brutal rule of an unknowing necessity, that is, the necessity of the process of actualisation of potential energy. The notion of an end to be accomplished was central in Aristotle's definition of a natural operation, but it was an end that constitutively could not be envisaged by the natural agent. In such a view, the fulfilment of the end prevailed brutally over the acting subject, squashing as it were its individual perceptive and desiring life. In Campanella's interpretation, Aristotle's parricidal demise of 10 Campanella - Medicinalium librì, p. 19. 11 Ibid., p. 21. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofía Vol. 66 -Fase. 1 »2010</page><page sequence="6">14 Guido Giglioni Platonic metaphysics had led him to detach meaning from nature. 'Aristotle denies the idea , he summed up, 'because he denies that the world has been made by following the likeness of its idea . 12 A well-known example of this model of brutal teleology was Aristotle s thesis that the seed is not animated. By denying the seeds animation, Aristotle was forced to attribute the principle of its life and teleological drive to the motion of the generating principle. For Campanella, this was a sign of foolishness {grande stultizia) on Aristotle's part, for in this way he had been forced to claim that motion - which is not an existing reality ( ch'è un niente in esistenza)' - is capable of acting in the soul s stead and shaping the body 'by distinguishing bones, veins, arteries and internal organs with such a skill and power that sound philosophers concede to become God rather than the soul and heat. Certainly it does not become sheer motion1.13 Another key difficulty that Campanella detected in the Aristotelian view of bodily life was the notion of incorporeal soul. He argued that Aristotle 'has never been able to explain - and it is something that cannot be said nor believed - how the incorporeal soul, devoid of any physical quality, can produce heat and colď - that is, change conditions of thermal balance in the body - 'only through thinking . By being unable to explain the influence exercised by the faculties of the soul (especially the imagination) on the physiological states of the body, and instead by further detaching knowledge from nature, Aristotle went so far as 'to strip (spropriare) things of their properties and to replace them with violent actions'.14 Once again, the end result of Aristotle's purported harmonious teleology was in fact violence (a violence that in Campanella s general interpretation of seventeenth-century culture, underlay Machiavellism and Calvinism too).15 The criticisms that Campanella addressed to Galen's physiology were of a different tenor, undoubtedly less severe. One of the reasons might be that in Galen's tripartite division of the faculties of the soul, with its links to the Platonic notion of the soul, Campanella saw a very remote anticipation of his own metaphysical doctrine of the three fundamental attributes of being. The problem though, was that Galen, in Campanellas opinion, had made three souls out of the material temperaments of the brain, heart and liver (respectively, the rational, irascible and concupiscible souls) and that he had 12 Campanella - Epilogo magno, p. 324. 13 Campanella - Del senso delle cose e della magia.

Despite all these various distinctions, though, - Campanella went on - Galen had claimed that the temperaments of the heart and liver were able to obey or resist the rational soul 'as they like'.16 The same criticism applied to Galen s distinction of the vital faculties. For Campanella, the attractive, retentive and expulsive faculties were not distinct faculties, as Galen argued, but they were acts of 'one same spirit using different instruments, or made in different ways, for the sake of the organisms conservation'.17 To sum up, Campanella could not see how a Galenic view of anatomo- physiology, with its emphasis on material temperaments, might account for the actions and reactions of the so-called 'irascible' and 'concupiscible' souls, without attributing a form of perception to the natural faculties of the soul. This point was all the more important for Campanella because control of the passions (deriving from the spirited - 'irascible' - soul) and appetites (deriving from the desiderative - concupiscible' - soul) was an integral part of his theory of magic. Through reading De placitis Hippocratis et Piatonis, Campanella was well-acquainted with Galen's discussion of the physiological prerogatives of the hegemonikon in Stoic natural philosophy. Indeed, Campanella's own position seems to be particularly influenced by the Stoic notion of pneuma with its emphasis on the 'rational' nature of the spirit. The difference is that for Campanella the source and principal location of the spirit was in the head, and not, as maintained by Chrysippus, in the heart. Against Galen one can see that the animal, vital and natural spirit is one, that the rational, irascible and concupiscible virtue is one, that this virtue is located in the head, and it is the spirit, and not the temperament of the brain, heart and liver, for these temperaments are corporeal and unsentient. And if the heart and the liver do not have the power of perception, as Galen admits, they will not be able to obey the brain, as he says. For this reason Platon assigned perception to all the parts of the body, in order that they can obey the head. And we have already demonstrated that pulsation and respiration are voluntary motions. Furthermore, that anger and appetite are accompanied by judgment (si fan con giudizio) is proved by the fact that we get enraged not because someone did something wrong to us, but because we feel offended.18 Emotions and appetites are not irrational drives that cannot be controlled by reason. Indeed, emotions are forms of sophisticated perception. Our anger, explains Campanella, is provoked by acts of anti-social behaviour more than 16 Campanella - Del senso delle cose, p. 47. 17 Campanella - Epilogo magno, p. 365. 18 Ibid., p. 425.

As for the apparent conflicts between the cognitive, appetitive and emotional faculties, they are in fact different stages within the process of 'the soul arguing with itself.19 It is precisely the view that the soul is the same as the sentient, irascible and concupiscible spirit that represents the ultimate physiological foundation of Campanellas theory of magic. The tone and the language of the argument are reminiscent of the Stoic notion of reason and spirit: in all these actions, we must assign a power of perception (senso) to the emotion of anger and to the appetite because reason would not be capable of restraining them through the use of arguments, if they were not able to listen to them. And when reason is overcome by anger or appetite, it would not yield but for the fact that it is persuaded that there is some good in the act of vengeance or in the object of pleasure. If reason is persuaded by them, it is more than obvious that they are capable of perception and knowledge since they manage to convince reason. If it is the case that reason convinces itself, then the soul is only one substance that argues against or in favour.20 In both cases, whether the passions are constitutively different from the discursive power or whether they are the way in which reason, the only soul, dramatises its own arguments during the process of self-deliberation, for Campanella the fact remains that the soul is one sentient power diffused throughout the body by means of a material spirit. In the first case, the difference between passions and reason can be understood in terms of varying levels of perception. In the second case, perception is the same throughout, which is a view that is very close to the Stoic ideal of the passions as judgments of reason. Campanella oscillates often between the two views, but the second solution is the one that seems to appeal to him the most. Knowledge of the highest and subtlest kind is always at work in the body, in the various processes aiming at maintaining and perpetuating life and in a whole range of appetitive tendencies. There are functions in the body that are too complex (cose di troppo senno ) to be simply attributed to the unsentient mechanism of the material temperament of the various organs. As for the difference between voluntary and involuntary functions, far from demonstrating the existence of sentient and unsentient faculties, this is rather a proof for Campanella that the body is uniformly governed by a most refined form of wisdom, in that the most delicate decisions concerning life (such as pulsation and respiration) are made by the swiftest and keenest portion of the sentient spirit, a degree of perception that is too subtle to be perceived by man's awareness. The heart will never stop beating as a result of being convinced to do so by some arguments - cogent as they may be - adduced by the discursive faculty of reason. In Campanellas natural philosophy, the reasons of life are 19 Campanella - Epilogo magno, p. 426. 20 Campanella - Del senso delle cose, p. 48. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofía Vol. 66 -Fase. 1 • 2010</page><page sequence="9">The Anatomical Foundations of Tommaso Campanella's Theory of Magic 17 deeper than the reasons of reason. The perception governing the motion of the heart is so deep-seated in the rational economy of the living being that it is never going to listen to external and 'irrational' arguments. The vital heat of nature cannot give orders that may be conducive to its own annihilation (a sé non può imperare contra sé).21 Such a relationship between reason and passions finds application in the domain of magic. In both his medicine and other sections of his philosophical system, Campanella outlined a psycho-physiological account of the passions involved in the practice of magic. He was convinced that the success of man's action in the worlds of both nature and human society his ability to produce real transformations, depended on the extent to which the faculties of the human soul could have a corresponding impact on the material universe. The premises of this physical and physiological parallelism were: a theory of universal sentience (each thing in nature perceives), whereby the whole created universe can take care of its own self-preservation; a view of active material media made up of an imponderable, subtle, extremely reactive substance (the spirit) capable to mediate between matter and energy, nature and knowledge; a view of God as a wise dispenser and administrator of varying degrees of awareness in the universe, distributed according to their specific functions; finally, an all-encompassing theory of communication based on a theory of perception in which even symbolical correspondences can be traced back to the sense of touch. Given these premises, one can safely say that a distinctive interplay of magic, anatomy and rhetoric is at work in Campanellas philosophy.22 For Campanella, the notion of a unitary and sentient, reactive and appetitive spirit was the fundamental physiological rationale that justified 21 Ibid., p. 52.

Such a material substance - intrinsically reactive because inherently provided with perception, energy and appetite - represented the anatomo-physiological prerequisite for the success of all sorts of magical activities. As already said, in Campanella s system of knowledge, magic means first of all communication, a powerful form of communication that is not confined to the description of things but aims at their transformation. From the immediate sensation of pain and pleasure that testifies to the direct perception of external reality to the condition of being completely overwhelmed by the imagination, to the point that the only reality that is the object of one s perception becomes the imagined reality, perception and reality represent the two poles of an ongoing process of unremitting communication. The following excerpt from II senso delle cose - the work that contains Campanellas most radical affirmation of nature' sensism - is worth being quoted in full Being of a mobile and receptive nature, the animal spirit is suitable to react to the action of all things (patir di ogni cosa) and to receive from them all sorts of impressions, more or less intense; and the soul, which is enveloped by the spirit, reacts with it as if they were one body and it takes on and assimilate ( s'infà ) its impressions. The principal passions are pain and pleasure, which are keen perceptions of the present good or ill. Love and hatred are tendencies towards goods and against ills that are not connected to immediate perception, for when they are united, they provide either joy or pain. Hope and fear are flight from an absent ill or pursuit of an absent good with the aim of gaining some known benefit. Trust (fiducia) is the perception of something from which one argues a certain good, and the contrary is mistrust (diffidenza). Faith is the mother of trust, because it is the perception of a good thing that is not present but remote, and trust is what one hopes to gain from this good perception through reasoning. True imagination is when the spirit takes on the nature of a thing and think of it as it is, without mistaking it for something else; bad imagination is when the spirit is affected by something to the point that it cannot move with any other motion, but that motion of the imagination obliterates all the other ones, and any other motion arouses only that same motion.23 From the most elementary perception to the process of the imagination passing through the vitally crucial functions of trust and confidence, an uninterrupted flow of knowledge pervades the whole system of nature. Campanellas theory of magic rests on the general principle that nature is endowed with perception in all its parts. To pre-empt predictable charges of anthropomorphism, he made clear that the kind of sentience in question was natural, that is, based on various levels of awareness and extended to all states of matter, both similar (inorganic) and dissimilar (organic), and that it was 23 Campanella - Del senso delle cose, p. 177.

The origin of this view is to be found in Telesios naturalism. In his De natura iuxta propria principia (1565, 1570, 1586), Telesio had explained all material transformations in nature as results of the sentient heat coming from the sun. To this view, Campanella added important references to rhetoric and magic. Campanellas original interplay of magic, anatomy and rhetoric comes to the fore especially when one examines the way in which he connected spirit, air and perception. In Campanellas cosmology there is a special relationship between atmospheric air, mans body and the physiology of perception. Air, explained Campanella, is 'the common spirit upon which all animals feed and live, since it is sentient and perceives all the affects of things ( tutte le passioni delle cose) and it communicates them to the spirit to which it is joined'.24 'This spirit of the universe {spirito mondiale )' he continued, 'is riddled with many past sensations and it can imprint new conjectures in us; and when it is hot, it makes us angry, when it is clear, it makes us cheerful, when it is troubled, it makes us saď.25 Campanella considered the physical phenomenon of sound to be the privileged channel through which air communicates its motion to all the parts of the universe. He thought that sounds impressed on air had the power to invite things to motion and activity, and therefore they boost the feeling of being alive, that is to say, sounds had a special relationship with ones sense of preservation. Here is the way Campanella characterised harmony: 'everything in the world is harmony because movement pervades everything and every motion in its making is called motion and is called sound in its being perceived'.26 Change as a material, 'objective' phenomenon is motion; as a 'subjective' perception is sound. Of the various ways in which air resonates, the articulation of words through the use of breath and the voice was for Campanella the most delicate and influential. Words, he said, imitate sounds through 'figures of motion' produced during the activity of respiration. The basic principle behind this statement was that human voice has the ability to shape air into forms that have a certain likeness with things.27 Campanella explained forms of natural divination and prophecy by referring to the subtlety and nimbleness of the spirit and the universal medium of sentient air: 'those who have a very subtle, warm spirit as a result of their hot liver and heart are the most apt to perceive (prontissimi a sentire), for a spirit of this nature is influenced {viene a patire) by the least event, whether 24 Campanella - Epilogo magno, p. 492. 25 Ibid., pp. 493-494.

Sentience does not depend on organs and bodily structures; indeed, it is precisely a result of its being supple, pervasive and continuous. Air, wrote Campanella in Del senso delle cose, sees through the light, hears through motions, smells through vapours, tastes through thin matter, touches hot and cold through being compressed, feels pain and pleasure, and, without being confined in organs, it is able to be sentient throughout its substance and perceive all other sensations (consentire)' . 31 The responsive nature of this all-pervasive aerial substratum depends on its ability to touch all the things with which it comes into contact. In keeping with the principles of Telesian physics, the sense of touch becomes thus the original form of perception. Actions in nature occur through touch or, in the absence of direct contact, through surrogates of touch perceptions based on the likenesses of originally tactile perceptions: 'since all things touch each other, and the ones that are not touched are similar to the ones that have been touched, all things perceive each other either because they are physically present (per presenza ) or because they resemble each other (per similitudine). To perceive through likeness (per similitudine) is discourse, to perceive a previously perceived perception (risentire) is memory, to perceive many different things as one is intelligence'.32 If for reasons of linguistic propriety, it is not correct to say that 'things have discourse and intellect', the fact remains that 'things perceive, retrieve their former perception (risentono), evaluate, proceed by argument and know'.33 For Campanella, to talk is therefore one of the various forms of being physically connected with the rest of the world. Spoken language is one of the most sophisticated forms of natural magnetism as it were, and like 28 Ibid., p. 459. 29 Campanella - Del senso delle cose, p. 78. 30 Campanella - Epilogo magno, p. 462.

Discussing the origin of language in Del senso delle cose, Campanella explains that the spirit, wishing to signify what it perceives to other natural beings, was compelled to represent (fìngere) through breathed air the likeness that that thing has with the motions that resound (. suonano ) in the mouth'.34 It is a radically onomatopoeic view of language, in which words are seen as material offshoots of the sentient spirit of nature. Airs role in the communicative and rhetorical aspects of magic is, therefore, crucial. One has almost the impression that for Campanella the meaning is a physical reality, tantamount to the act of being touched by aerial likenesses of things shaped by the mouth of the speaker: many sagacious keen minds immediately perceive in the air what the interlocutor is thinking, for thinking is a motion of the spirit, and this motion is smoothly communicated to the air. In this way, they divine their interlocutors thoughts very easily without knowing how. When one utters soft words, he strikes the air slightly and he communicates that mild motion to his interlocutor and appeases his mood. If he speaks harshly and loud, even if he does not say offensive words, he arouses someone's indignation, for the spirit is moved by the air with motions that hit and rent it. Air, therefore, receives not only the motion, but also the affect, otherwise it would not be able to communicate.35 To think is to perceive absent things by perceiving their likenesses in the form of surrogates of shaped air. Air is the great repository of affects and likenesses and contains the beginnings of future events. A keen ability to perceive these airy representations of affects and sensations make some people natural prophets and diviners. Furthermore, the close intertwinement of medicine, rhetoric and magic in Campanella s natural philosophy accounts for two types of communication, one within and the other without the body. If the physiology of the one sentient spirit explains the effects of the various levels of perceptual awareness and the passions of the soul within the body, the rhetorical model based on the physical power of the word and airs pervasive influence explains the effects that human perception can have on the surrounding world. In his Rhetoricorum liber, Campanella defined rhetoric as a small province of magic. He compared the work of the rhetorician to that of the physician: the relationship that links the orator to his audience and his speech is the same as the one that links the physician to his patient and the medicines he administers. He argued that the rhetorician, in order to alter the affects of the soul, had even stronger and more reliable instruments (such as logical arguments, religious beliefs and scientific theories) than the ones used 34 Ibid., p. 55. 35 Ibid., p. 136. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 -Fase. 1 • 2010</page><page sequence="14">22 Guido Giglioni by physicians (i.e., their various means of channelling the forces of nature through drugs).36 He mentioned three viae through which a rhetorician could exercise this power, namely, the representations of the objects to be impressed on the audience s mind, the transmission of the affects and the use of reason: The rhetorician needs to know the way in which all passions are aroused, and, since he is not using heat, cold, herbs and drugs, as the sky and physicians do, two means remain for him of arousing the soul: one is by providing graphic representations of the objects of each passion (as when we offer dreadful descriptions to arouse fear, delightful descriptions to induce pleasure, novelties to provoke wonder), the other by communi- cating the rhetorician s own affect to the audience through the impetus of his speech.37 This last reaction, in particular, is based on the principle that 'the spirit is moved to a similar behaviour by a similar cause'.38 However - Campanella went on - even more powerful than graphic descriptions of emotions (obiecta passionum) and transfers of affects (affectionis communicatio), is a good, solid, persuasive rational argument (ratio). By using reason, a rhetorician can 'bind' the soul of a man in a more effective and lasting way than drugs or stars can do, since drugs and stars merely change the body and its inclinations ( quae solum disponunt corpus immutando). It is one of Campanellas strongest beliefs that the human soul is free and has the power not to follow the passions of the temperament and of the spirit. In his Rhetoricorum liber, the echo of Galen's Quod animi mores corporis temperamenta sequantur is clear, with the difference that here Campanella is closer to Chiysippus than Galen: 'The human soul may not follow the passions of the temperament and the spirit, when these passions are not extremely intense1.39 Rejecting all forms of biological determinism, Campanella maintained that reason (i.e., sentient spirit) could alter the state of ones own body and, through the communication of words (i.e., waves of sentient air) it could alter the states of other peoples bodies. What is more, Campanella rejected the Platonic, Aristotelian and Galenic view that a fundamental distinction separated the sphere of reason from that of the passions (the domain of the irrational, the alogon). For the Aristotelians, one and the same thing could not be opposed to itself, a substance could not act upon itself, and therefore reason could not argue against itself. Campanella, in maintaining the possibility of rational 36 Campanella - Rhetoricorum liber, pp. 742-744. I have examined the relationship between rhetoric and medicine in another Renaissance author, Girolamo Cardano. See 'The Many Rhetorical Personae of an Early Modern Physician'.

Pender (forthcoming). 37 Campanella - Rhetoricorum liber, p. 762. 38 Ibid. 39 Ibid.: 'Potest quidem anima humana temperamenti et spiritus passiones non sequi, ubi intensissimae non sunt, veluti in furentibus et in ebriis, potestque, relieta affectione, sequi rationem, sicuti interdum rationem spernit, ut passionem sequatur (Italics is mine).

As already said at the beginning of this article, by magic Campanella meant first and foremost communication of energy and knowledge. It is no accident, therefore, that he viewed rhetoric as one of the constitutive disciplines of magic. In doing so, he appealed to the time-honoured notion of the magic of the word theorised in ancient times by the sophist Górgias. The distinctive feature in Campanellas system of magic is that the word is both a symbolic and a physical entity. Meaning flows from nature to the mind and from the mind to nature. Words are both carriers of meanings and physical agents of psychosomatic transformation. As I have shown by pointing to a number of paradigmatic cases such as natural divination and prophecy, the force of the imagination, the patients trust in the power of the physician or the healer, and the many influences that air exercises on the body, Campanellas theory of magic rests on a definite anatomo-physiological basis. The most original aspect, though, is the way in which Campanella reinterpreted Aristotles and Galen's principles of anatomy so that he could adapt his medical views to the broader framework of his theory of magic (practice), on the one hand, and metaphysics (theory), on the other. In addition, Campanellas original account of emotions and passions supported a comprehensive system of magical practice that dispensed with the basic principles of both Aristotle's and Galens physiology. Campanella was convinced that the vital operations of the body could not be explained by simply relying on the unsentient functions of the vegetative soul (Aristotle) or on the natural faculties of the body (Galen), nor could they be accounted for by assuming the existence of incorporeal souls (Aristotle) or bodily temperaments (Galen). He argued that Aristotle, Galen and their followers had demonstrated a blatant lack of consistency every time they had postulated the existence of natural powers without assigning them the ability to perceive. In Campanellas view, all forms of real activity in nature, at all levels, presupposed in the natural agent the ability to know the end to accomplish. A natural power, precisely in order to be natural and not mechanical, could not be forced to act from without and had to be described in terms of a spontaneous activity. Insofar as it was capable of acting spontaneously, it had the ability to perceive and to know. In doing so, by refusing to endorse any form of biological or teleological determinism despite his expertise in the fields of medicine and astrology, Campanella went to great lengths to safeguard margins of freedom in the created universe. By circumventing both Aristotle's hylomorphism and Galen's vital materialism of the temperaments, and by appropriating the Stoic view of rational pneuma, he managed to produce a physiological model that was Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 -Fase 1 • 2010</page><page sequence="16">24 Guido Giglioni more flexible in dealing with the complex interplay of knowledge, action and appetite, and above all, better suited to account for a universe in which the flow of life and meaning encompassed various levels of communication.
