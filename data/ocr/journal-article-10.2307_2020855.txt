<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD OR THE EXTERNAL WORLD' D URING the last few years of his life, it became increasingly evident to Santayana that the ideas of God and an external world were interchangeable, in so far as they both ultimately referred to the same "efficacious reality." When these two ideas are stripped of their pictorial and emotional associations in human experience, our use of the word "God," or the phrase "the external world," becomes a question of what mood we are in or in what context we are speaking. The point at issue is that when these full-blown ideas are so denuded by reflection, what we are left with is the defiant core of both ideas; namely, the irreducible conviction of a primordial power or "efficacious reality" that impinges upon and controls the field of experience. But here again, this notion (or conviction) of power may be styled either the "Will of God," or the causal operation of the external world upon our senses, according to the mood or context in which a philosopher is speaking at the moment. Seen in the light of such a radical reduction, one is inclined to agree with Nicolas Berdyaev when he says that it is as easy to believe in God as an external world. I Let us consider first the defiant core of the complex idea of an external world. Even the fashionable school that is disposed to 1 The substance of this paper was delivered at a Memorial Meeting in tribute to George Santayana, given by the Department of Philosophy of Columbia University at the Harkness Academic Theater in May, 1953.</page><page sequence="2">58 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY define a material thing as a logical construction of sense-data, and the "causal theory of perception" as a convenient device to facil- itate the explanation of the stubborn order of our observations, can hardly overlook the hard fact of interruption of experience by an irrational "intrusion." As Santayana has written in an unpublished note: The category of power or cause belongs to the primary utterance of life. . . .The physical validity of this category may be disallowed by the sceptic, at the price of abandoning all animal faith, all expectation, and all claims to transitive knowledge. Such an abandonment, though impossible in practice, is easy in theory, since the assumption of transitive knowledge is not im- posed on us by logic, reviewing static ideas, but is an act of faith resting on the biological fact of reaction. When the body responds to a stimulus, the mind becomes aware, not only of this reflex, but also of the intrusion from without which provoked it: indeed it is the intrusion rather than the reaction itself, that is felt in the form of irritation, pain, and impatience. . . Power, especially hostile power, therefore looms before the spirit from the very dawn of consciousness. For the sake of argument, I will concede here that our notion of a material thing is a logical construction, and that this con- struction is in no sense a "duplicate" of a "thing" in the external world. Furthermore, I will grant that we have no insight into the nature of causal operations beyond the scope of our senses. In other words, I am prepared to give a philosopher like Mr. Ayer a good run for his money when he writes somewhere that "the world of science is a rational construction which furnishes a means of correlating sense-data; the causal theory of perception is itself an instance of such a correlation." But the defiant core of the stripped idea of an external world still remains. We cannot eradi- cate the living conviction that there is an "efficacious realityy" intruding upon our experience, even if we officially ignore it in theory. And I suggest that it is this primordial power that we are all endeavouring to understand and control if possible to our advantage. The core of the idea of an external world is best defined by Mr. I. A. Richards as "the influences, of whatever nature, to which the mind is subject from whatever is without and independ- ent of itself. " 2 "Influences " is an admirable word. It emphasises the causal compulsion of the "background" of experience, without saying anything about its nature-be it material or mental or "neutral." If it is more convenient for the physicist, in certain experimental contexts, to construe these influences as undulatory, and in others as corpuscular, there is no objection to such a procedure. For all I know, the "efficacious reality" that sur- 2 Coleridge on Imagination, p. 157.</page><page sequence="3">GOD OR THE EXTERNAL WORLD 59 rounds the "foreground" of human experience may be both undulatory and corpuscular, continuous and discontinuous. Sci- entific models are incorrigibly pictorial and always going out of fashion. As an eminent French physicist has said: May it not be universally true that the concepts produced by the human mind, when formulated in a slightly vague form, are roughly valid for reality, but that, when extreme precision is aimed at, they become ideal forms whose real content tends to vanish away? 3 It is only when a philosopher of science implies that some "ra- tional construction" (manufactured in his study) can intrude u,pon or influence the order of experience, that our suspicions are aroused. Our idea, or rational construction, of an external world is one thing; it is a symptom of cosmic impiety and egotism to mistake it for the primordial power that sustains our lives, and even permits us to play our professional games for a season. II Once we have acknowledged the efficacious background in which our little islands of experience are embedded, the logical stage is set for deflating the full-blown conventional idea of God. As we stripped the complex idea of an external world to its hard core, so we must now denude the idea of God of all the anthropomorphic drapery in which the imagination of man has fashioned it. First of all, let us expose an extension of what I venture to call (perhaps disrespectfully) the "Father Christmas" notion of deity. When I was a child I was informed that if I behaved myself for a decent interval before Christmas, then, and only then, Santa Claus would reward me with the toys I so ardently desired. Somewhat later on in life, I was instructed that if I obeyed the prevailing conven- tions of my community, then in an after-life I would again be rewarded with all sorts of unimaginable blessings. And just as Santa Claus would have punished me, if I had been a naughty boy, by overlooking me on Christmas day, so this home-spun " God" would have ignored me (not to mention anything worse) after I died, if I had not lived up to the standards of prescribed conduct. In other words, in both cases one was being bribed to behave oneself. And it did not take me long to decide that I wanted nothing to do with such a "God." It may be thought that this extension of the Father Christmas complex is a travesty of our Western conception of God. But I am convinced that the latter is simply a refinement and elaboration of the same idea of rewards and punishments, and is open to the same charge of bribery. Consider the fantastic supernatural 3 Louis de Broglie.</page><page sequence="4">60 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY machinery of heaven and hell in Christian theology! I prefer the innocent bluntness of Jacob who offered his God ten per cent in exchange for divine protection. This is not the occasion, however, to go into all the endless controversies turning on the idea of merits and demerits. Let me say simply that I hope the psychology of baits and threats will some day be dropped from religious in- struction, and that Man will be allowed to stand intellectually on his own feet as well as physically. It is high time we agreed on a more mature and universal idea of deity. The task is to find and clarify the least common denominator in all religions-what Mr. Aldous Huxley has called "the Ground." The dominant theme of such an "ultimate religion" has been most beautifully expressed by Santayana in another unpublished note I found among his papers after his death: Under the name of omnificent power we may bring together all the gods invoked by religious fear or religious hope and reduce them to their efficacious reality. We thereby break with selfish superstition. The influences of place and the claims of religious tradition are all equalized: nothing is denied in them except the assumption of exclusiveness or pre-eminence. At the same time, by a fitting compensation, religion is turned in the spiritual direction. Universal power, even while sometimes fulfilling our desires, sooner or later betrays them, and passes on to some alien enterprise. Knowledge of this divine inhumanity in things, in disenchanting liberates: it detaches the spirit from its home world, not angrily or morosely, as if that world had been intrinsically evil or inferior, nor yet ambitiously, as if another better world were to be substituted for it, but patiently and philosophically, because it must needs be that such things come, and also that they disappear. Spirit does not detach us from the world as one part of the world, or one age or one nation, often cuts itself off from another, with an ignorance which permits hatred and a hatred which petrifies ignorance. That which detaches spirit from the world is precisely knowledge of the world. You acquiesce because you under- stand; yet just because you understand you exchange the ignominious alle- giance which you owed to your prejudices and to your earthly fortunes for an intelligent allegiance to the nature of things. There is nothing for me to add to such a confirmation of the core of the notion of God. III To sum up: In clarifying the idea of an external world, we found it was "impossible in practice" to ignore the "intrusion" and control of a primordial power that both interrupts and sus- tains the order of experience. Furthermore, the actual order that we do rely on in our perceptual lives is a brute contingent fact, when viewed from the standpoint of what Santayana has called the "realm of essence." Our "animal faith" in the obstinate habits of expectation, or customary regularities of nature, is prior to and presupposed by any conceptual device-any expedient hypothesis</page><page sequence="5">GOD OR THE EXTERNAL WORLD 61 to explain the causal orders of the world. The latest policies of scientific investigation are only successful in so far as they are grounded on and utilise the abundant power at our disposal. If we are sincere in our philosophy, and not merely playing a professional game, all this points to the primordial operation of an "efficacious reality" surrounding the little "foreground" of perception. Is not a vast "background" of experience what we all really mean by an external world, or God, according to the mood we are in? One of the last things Santayana said to me is well worth repeating here: "I do not presume to describe the nature of the Naked Divine: my categories are only categories of the Image. But if what science says is true, then it seems obvious to me that the world must have certain inevitable properties." 4 The reader will notice in this quotation that the ideas of "the Naked Divine" and "the world" have become interchange- able in Santayana's mind: he sometimes used the term "efficacious reality" to embrace the controlling object of both our religious and more secular attitudes. For the religious attitude of respect for God is at bottom the same thing as our sense of dependence on an all-embosoming world that occasionally awakens to conscious- ness in our individual minds. It is a mistake, both morally and epistemologically, to be exclusively preoccupied with the little "foreground" of experience; if we are, we go the way of John Dewey, and become too involved with the Image of the world, suffering a loss of that "cosmic piety" that Russell has emphasised. The task of science would assume a new significance if it were suspected that in deciphering the structure of the world, and endeavouring to harness its primordial power, we were really tampering with the body of God. Is it impious to suggest such a possibility to the administrators of the precarious products of scientific genius ? In Santayana's last hours, a calm acceptance of the "Will of God," or the primordial "authority of things," was conspicuous in the face of considerable suffering. He died in conformity with the great religious insights of the ages, such as "in Thy Will is our peace." But by temperament and a certain inherited tone of pessimism he was most akin to Spinoza, who reminds us "that he who truly loves God, cannot seek that God should love him in return." DANIEL CORY 4The properties that Santayana had in mind are somewhat akin to those essential postulates of structure that Russell has formulated at the end of his book on Human Knowledge.</page></plain_text>
