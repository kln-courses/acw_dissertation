Goldwater railed against urban dogs as use- less creatures that offered nothing but a public health threat. "Can you tell me," he cried, "what dogs are good for in a city? In the country they are all right, but in a city they are a nuisance from the point of view of sanitation, and there is always the danger of rabies." Goldwater called for a year-round muzzling requirement and a new, municipally run pound to address the problem. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (aspca), which had possessed enforcement power over the city's canine animal control laws since the mid- 1890s, immediately objected that it already possessed the capacity and expertise to deal effectively with stray dogs, and the society's superintendent, Thomas F. Freel, hinted that malign health officials sought to rid the city of dogs entirely. In response Deputy Health Commissioner Haven Emerson directly attacked the aspca for its inadequate control of strays. He declared, "You can quote me as saying that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals does not cope with the situation con- fronting the city."1 This exchange, which came toward the end of more than a decade of confrontation between the aspca and the New York City Department of Health over canine animal control, raises profound questions about the changing nature of the police power and the American state in the early twentieth century. Why did an ostensibly private, voluntary association have the power to enforce New York City's dog laws, and why did a municipal agency seek to take away that authority in the early decades of the twentieth century?

This essay explores those questions through the history of canine animal control. The evolving field of animal studies has tended to concentrate on the cultural construction of animality and its implications for human forms of identity and exclusion, but animals' presence in human society has helped shape the full range of human experiences, includ- ing matters of regulation and state power. Meanwhile, historians of the United States have identified a complex set of problems related to the public-private relationship and its implications for understanding American forms of governance. Some two decades ago, in a discussion in which they agreed upon little else, Terrence J. McDonald and Ira Katznelson called upon scholars to integrate the history of urban politics, including "the definition and redefinition of public and private into analyses of American political development. More recently, William Novak has renewed the call to arms by challenging historians to look beyond federal executive power in their conceptions of the American state and its evolution, and to grapple forthrightly with the messy distribution of governmental authority in the United States in "an exceedingly complex welter of institutions, jurisdic- tions, branches, offices, programs, rules, customs, laws, and regulations." As countless histories have demonstrated, a trend toward formalized, bureaucratized authority at the local, state, and federal levels characterized twentieth-century American political develop- ment, but few scholars have explored, or even recognized, how that shift coexisted with alternative configurations of the public-private relationship in a disorderly, heated process of negotiation and contestation that continues to this day. Novak, however, has suggested that the particular genius of the American state may lie in its multilayered, decentralized, infinitely divisible character, as opposed to the Weberian stereotype of expert-led, ratio- nalized bureaucracy as the essence of the modern state. Animal control is but one of innumerable areas of everyday public policy in which voluntary associations continue to wield police power, perform public functions, and exercise state authority alongside formally constituted governmental agencies, at times in a spirit of partnership, and at other times as intense rivals.2 References to citizens' groups, and particularly the challenge they posed to patronage- oriented systems of municipal government, abound in studies of turn-of-the-century urban reform. Historians' assumption of a separation between public and private, or state and civil society, however, has frequently compelled them to treat voluntary associations as external to the state and to limit their political role to education, exhortation, and lobbying as their means to change public policy. In recent years, however, scholars have begun to go beyond the conventional historiography and develop a richer understanding of the interpenetration of civic groups and the state.3 Accordingly, the history of the 2 Jennifer Wolch and Jody Emel, eds., Animal Geographies: Place, Politics , and Identity in the Nature-Culture Borderlands (London, 1998); Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman, eds., Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism (New York, 2005); Terrence J.

Historians are only beginning to untangle the knotty public-private relationship and examine how the presumed separation between the two arose from specific historical changes and not a timeless quality of political theory.4 By the early twentieth century, the progressive mantra of expertise and formalized bureaucratic authority sought to supersede not just the urban political machine but also a system of power defined by a highly per- meable boundary between state and society that granted considerable public authority to the aspca and other citizens' groups. But New York's health department failed to break the regulatory authority and police power of the aspca. Although the health department's actions, as well as a series of court decisions related to the police power of animal-welfare organizations, placed the society on the defensive, the aspca continued to issue dog licenses, enforce the dog laws, and run the city pound into the 1990s. Hie society's lon- gevity as a private organization charged with public purposes provides just one example of how the transformation of police power and the formalization of governmental author- ity that reshaped the American state in the early decades of the twentieth century did not replace an old order as much as it adapted and co-evolved with it. This essay develops that analysis of canine animal control in four parts. It begins with an overview of domestic animals' place in the American city and a discussion of the gradual structural changes in New York's dog-catching system that culminated in the aspca's acquisition of authority over canine animal control in 1894. The narrative then turns to how the Department of Health's growing capacities in rabies diagnosis, treat- ment, and prevention led it to place stronger emphasis on rabies prevention in the early twentieth century. The third section turns to confrontations between the aspca and the Department of Health in 1903, 1908, and 1914, and health officials' success in pass- ing a year-round muzzling ordinance over the strenuous objections of animal-welfare America (Chapel Hill, 1996). On the period since 1870, the literature has largely neglected voluntary organizations' statist functions. Histories concerning the policing of sexual activity and its cultural representation, for example, often refer to voluntary organizations but have generally devoted little sustained analysis to citizens' groups' exercise of state power. See, for example, Allan M. Brandt, No Magic Bullet: A Social History of Venereal Disease in the United States since 1880 (New York, 1987); and George Chauncey, Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture , and the Making of a Gay Male World, 1890-1940 (New York, 1994), 131-49. In Prurient Interests, Andrea Friedman acknowledges the status of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice "as a private organization granted law-enforcement responsibilities," but her overall emphasis on "democratic moral authority" reinforces an analytical separation between civil society and the state.

Carpenter, The Forging of Bureaucratic Autonomy: Reputations, Networks, and Policy Innovation in Executive Agencies, 1862-1928 (Princeton, 2001), 83-88, 102-12, 144-57, 176-78.

The final section examines the shift in police-power jurisprudence that threat- ened, but ultimately sanctioned, the states delegation of power to the aspca and pre- served the society's ability to exercise police power in an era of greater assertiveness by the citys public health bureaucracy. From Bounty Hunters to Municipal Dogcatchers to the aspca: Policing Dogs in Nineteenth-Century New York On July 11, 1856, the New York Daily Times responded to reports of dog-bite incidents and one rabies death in nearby Paterson, New Jersey, with a vigorous tirade against dogs running loose on the streets of New York: it is villainous that our pounds should be so little patronized, and such swarms of dogs allowed to run unmuzzled. ... In a brief walk of not more than a third of a mile, yesterday, we counted no fewer than twenty-seven ugly yelping rascals, every one of whose snouts ought to, but did not enjoy the protection of a wire network. . . . There is talk of a rising of the people in imitation of the San Franciscans - of the appoint- ment of a Vigilance Committee - of a grand mass meeting near the City Hall, to initiate a new dog-law - and hang those who have failed to execute the old one. . . . [Dogs] swarm in all the streets, obstruct the pavements, make night hideous with their howls, and have a worse name than Aldermen in New York. In addition to its commentary on the failures of city government and its appeal to citizen vigilance, the editorial provided a vivid depiction of animals' contribution to the disorder of the nineteenth-century city: dogs on the loose threatened disease, bodily harm, and sheer nuisance. Debates over animal control also reflected larger struggles over how to regulate city life and ensure public health and safety in an age of intense class conflict and endless rumination over the alarmingly tenuous state of the urban social order. From 1 800 to 1900 New York grew from a modest city of 60,000 to a grand metropolis of 3.4 million, and as ever-growing numbers of people came to live in close proximity, New Yorkers argued vociferously about every aspect of urban existence, including the menace of dogs roaming the streets and the unsavory character of the persons charged with their removal.5 Nineteenth-century human ecology encompassed regular interactions with domesti- cated animals to a degree difficult to imagine today. As Susan D. Jones has observed, "Most Americans, whether they lived in urban, suburban, or rural areas, had some daily contact with horses, cattle, poultry, dogs, cats, or other animals that provided food, raw materials, and power for manufacturing, companionship, and transportation." Animals formed a central part of the economy, providing both jobs and transportation. Horses hauled freight and passengers in the nineteenth-century city, and they persisted in fire- houses and other specialized urban niches as late as the 1 920s. Livestock animals remained a common sight in urban areas, either in commercial stockyards where sheep, cattle, and pigs awaited slaughter or right in residential neighborhoods where locals raised them for food. Free-ranging pigs patrolled New York's streets, in part because they offered a practical means of garbage control.

In most American cities, pigs continued to run loose until the end of the nineteenth century. One could also find dairy cows in urban backyards until cities began to require their removal in the early 1900s. New York allowed residents to keep fowl and livestock if they could procure the necessary permits; countless numbers of unsanctioned goats, chickens, and other animals also resided in the city well into the twentieth century.6 Cats and dogs, whether owned or stray, also ran loose on city streets. The number of dogs in New York is impossible to know with any accuracy. Figures from Brooklyn in the late 1870s, for example, ranged from 20,000 strays in 1877 to a police count of just 7,615 dogs in 1879. Later statistics veered just as widely. In 1899 one estimate of New York City's dog population put the number of owned dogs at about 75,000, while another less than a decade later counted 200,000 pet dogs, with an additional 155,000 strays. Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century descriptions of dogs in the streets and regular newspaper reports about dog-bite cases, however, testify to dogs' ubiquitous urban pres- ence. Historians still know little about pet-keeping practices beyond middle- and upper- class households, but Katherine Grier has suggested that the keeping of companion animals occurred "in all classes, regions, and ethnic groups." Anecdotal evidence from early twentieth-century newspapers, such as a tale of a dog smuggled by steerage passen- gers, dog hoarding by people living in a cramped shanty, or a boy bitten by a pet dog in a multifamily dwelling, also testify to dog ownership in poor and working-class house- holds. Although training manuals had already begun to advise "civilizing" the dog in the mid-nineteenth century, most pet dogs likely remained free to roam alongside their stray counterparts until well into the twentieth century. The canine population added yet another component to the problem of managing urban disorder and filth, and observers frequently linked the nuisance of stray dogs and their threat to human life. As the edito- rial comment about resorting to vigilante action indicates, animal control as a means of containing rabies was just one of a host of problems that raised larger questions about urban governance, the protection of the public health and safety, and the responsibilities of municipal governments versus those of citizens and voluntary associations.7 6 Susan D.

Until the nineteenth century, American cities generally relied on private individ- uals to fulfill what were considered their civic obligations to protect the public health and safety, as well as carry out other basic functions. As Hendrik Hartog has succinctly observed, in the case of street cleaning in New York City at the outset of the nineteenth century, "Mobilizing an army of public servants would never have occurred to the members of the Common Council." As rapid population growth produced an increasingly complex urban social structure, however, direct city employment spread to a wide variety of occupational categories. New York hired its first street cleaners in 1 803 and appointed a city inspector in 1804; by 1860 the city possessed an extensive bureaucratic apparatus, and it had taken direct responsibility for police, fire, education, and, to some extent, aid for the poor and needy.8 Amid this renegotiation of the nature and functions of municipal government, however, private ordering persisted in the exercise of police power and fulfillment of other public functions, particularly as urban reformers targeted what they perceived as inefficiency and corruption in machine governments. They offered, as alternatives, not just professional management and a new vision of expert-led, public administration but also their own services, particularly in the disbursement of charity and in the policing of public morality. One can trace this historical arc of municipal government in canine animal control, which evolved from a decades-old bounty system that relied on individual initiative to a force of municipally appointed dogcatchers in the 1870s, only to shift two decades later to the aegis of the aspca, a private voluntary association. New York's dogs enjoyed com- plete freedom to roam until the early nineteenth century, when the mayor first ordered police captains to pay bounties of fifty cents for unmuzzled dogs turned in at police sta- tions for dispatch during July and August, the summer months when rabies, according to popular mythology, was supposedly most prevalent. Although ordinary dog bites carried considerable danger of injury and infection, fear of rabies drove nineteenth-century efforts to limit the canine population. No animal-borne illness struck a greater sense of terror in humans, and in an era defined by considerable tolerance for daily risk, rabies nonetheless conjured powerful emotional responses despite the low incidence of the disease. In New York, ordinances authorizing the collection and disposal of unmuzzled dogs eventually became an annual summer ritual, supplemented by animal-control measures taken in response to specific incidents involving suspected mad dogs throughout the year. In 1850 management of dogs became more systematic with the establishment of a Dog Bureau to patrol the streets and club to death dogs that posed a public menace. A year later the city established its first dog pound, where "valuable dogs" at large could find some respite and hope of being reunited with their owners, rather than face immediate destruction.9 By the 1 860s urban reformers in New York launched increasingly vigorous attacks on the bounty system, which they viewed as a semicriminal realm particularly threatening to 8 Hartog, Public Property and Private Power, 63, 132; Duffy, History of Public Health in New York City, xx; Amy Bridges, A City in the Republic: Antebellum New York and the Origins of Machine Politics (Cambridge, Eng., 1983), 3; James F.

Animal welfare advocacy evolved in a mid-nineteenth-century milieu of urban class formation in which anxieties about a world of anonymous strangers, especially immigrants with seemingly threatening mores, drove the creation of a new middle-class identity centered on the family. An established common-law tradition that distinguished between useful livestock animals and creatures "kept for pleasure, curiosity, or caprice" had long recognized dogs' primary role as pets, but the rise of middle-class sentimentality transformed the status of household animals. By the 1 820s a domestic ethic of kindness to animals linked the treatment of pets and other creatures to the culti- vation of Victorian gentility. Affectionate relations toward pets in the household rein- forced the new middle-class ideal of intimate family life and, in particular, provided children the proper guidance in their development as moral beings. In 1 866 the establish- ment of New York City's aspca as the first animal-welfare society in the United States gave this ethic organized expression, and the society quickly gained the power to enforce new anticruelty laws aimed at ensuring humane treatment of the city's animals, whether they provided work, food, raw materials, companionship, or sport. Founded by Henry Bergh, the son of a wealthy New York shipbuilder, and modeled on Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the aspca also reflected the ambit of middle- and upper-class concern with civic morality, machine government, and urban disorder. New York, Boston, and Philadelphia quickly became centers of animal-welfare activism, while nearly every major U.S. city had an spca chapter by the 1890s. By the turn of the century, a thriving animal-welfare movement operated both nationally and internationally, through a wide range of spcas, humane societies, and other groups promoting new attitudes, legal protections, and institutional arrangements on behalf of animals.10 167-70. New York City's dog ordinances remained seasonal throughout the nineteenth century, even though an 1 856 study by the American Medical Association demonstrated that rabies could appear at any time of the year, and in subsequent decades experts and editorialists frequently protested that summer dog ordinances made little sense when statistics showed rates of rabies were as high or higher at other times of the year.

Animal-welfare advocates' assault on the bounty system richly illustrates the confluence of concerns about the humane treatment of animals with anxieties surrounding the mor- ally corrupt character of urban life. Dog catching was just one of the numerous street trades pursued by children. From reformers perspective, the street urchins and rough men engaged in dog catching skirted the edge of criminality and occupied an underworld</page><page sequence="9">1006 The Journal of American History March 2012 of vice and corruption. Nor did reformers believe the police necessarily provided disinter- ested public service. The citys bounty on loose dogs, as one observer wrote in 1855, merely encouraged "vigilant (?) policemen and dirty urchins, ambitious of the reward of 50 cents given for every seizure." The summer ordinances also prompted thefts of owned dogs, and stories of brazen attempts at canine theft while dogs accompanied their masters peppered the citys papers throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century. As late as June 1892 "A Citizen" described such a case to the New York Times: "In a contemptible way the roughs whom the city pays to do this work stole up behind the man, seized the dog, and bore it away to their wagon."11 Animal-welfare advocates also worried about the moral hazards dog catching posed to urban youth. The dog ordinances were "clearly detrimental to the morals" of young people according to one editorialist in 1868, and the city wrongly addressed the "unmitigated nuisance" of loose dogs with "the agency of cruel and sordid boys." In June 1874 Henry Bergh similarly targeted the bounty system for corrupting the morals of young people. "With a bribe of fifty cents," he warned darkly, "the idle youths of this City have been, in many instances, for the first time seduced into the temptation of stealing and betraying their friendly companions, the dogs." Bergh also attacked the pounds proximity to a nearby school, where he feared that "the screams of their condemned four-footed play- mates might facilitate the scholars' acquisition of immorality, and prepare them for the State Prison and the gallows!" Such dire forebodings typified the moral dangers that urban reformers perceived from virtually every street corner.12 The aspca and its supporters responded at first by trying to reshape the bounty system around the edges, an approach that preserved political ordering based on individuals' role in maintaining urban order. In 1 860 reformers succeeded in lowering the dog bounty to twenty-five cents and restricting direct payments to adults in an effort to remove children from the dog-catching business. The measure backfired, however, by merely shifting the advantage to dog brokers, middlemen who gave the street "boys" a fraction of the bounty and turned the dogs over to the city themselves at a healthy profit. By 1 867 the annual dog market had become an oligopoly of sorts, in which "five men . . . monopolize most of the dog-killing business." By the mid- 1870s, at the tail end of an era in which city employees and bureaucracies increasingly supplanted individual citizens in exercising governmental functions, mayorally appointed dogcatchers replaced the canine free market. The new measure, however, simply integrated the "Dog Ring" into Tammany Hall's patronage network. Critics viewed the shift not as a new form of public authority, but a rearrangement of the old system of relying on private individuals to carry out public functions, only now the deployment of municipal resources tied those individuals to cor- rupt partisan loyalties. One aspiring dogcatcher even used blackmail to secure an official appointment. Charles P. Matthias threatened to release sixty dogs he had captured, some of whom he claimed "show symptoms of hydrophobia," onto the streets of the city if a position failed to come through. According to one commentator, such was the character of "the candidate for dog catching honors," who barely concealed "the hand of steel under 11 "That Dog Pound - Onslaught of the Canines," New York Daily Times , June 26, 1855, p. 8; A Citizen, "The City's Dog Catchers: They Steal Dogs Walking Quietly with Their Owners," ibid., June 12, 1892, p. 11.

But Matthias's gambit apparently succeeded. An alderman immedi- ately invited him by telegraph to "Come down to the Mayor's office," adding, "The city cannot lose your valuable services."13 Meanwhile, the pegging of earnings to numbers of dogs caught continued to motivate theft, and reports of dogs stolen by city dogcatchers and held for ransom did nothing to improve dogcatchers' suspect image. One editorial writer pronounced in July 1883, "When the dog-catcher combines private speculation with public business and takes possession of a valuable dog, which is afterward 'found,' not at the pound but in a drinking saloon, he becomes more than a nuisance." That indignant observation drew a firm line between the respectability of the owners of valuable dogs (as opposed to mongrels or curs) and the disreputable persons responsible for dog collection whom one found in the loath- some saloon, the ever-present bugbear of urban reformers. Notably, Bergh and other aspca activists took their cause well beyond social-control efforts aimed at the poor and working class. They also attempted to go after owners of horse-car and omnibus companies, researchers who employed vivisection, and enthusiasts of pigeon shooting, rabbit coursing, fox hunting, and other blood sports of the social elite. At the same time, however, the middle-class social vision of domesticity, sentimentality, and order clearly contributed to the class basis of animal-welfare advocates' antipathy toward the bounty system and municipal dogcatchers.14 By 1890 efforts to reform dog catching had largely failed to remove children from the trade or to stamp out corruption. In the context of vastly increased activism by reformers on several fronts in 1890s New York, the aspca now sought to extend the police powers that had characterized the society's anticruelty efforts from the beginning, and it pushed to take over the city's dog-catching functions. Under new state laws in 1 894 the aspca gained authority over lost animals and strays in New York, and in Brooklyn the following year. New York City closed the municipal pound, and the aspca opened a new facility. Legislation also granted the society authority over dog licensing to fund its enforcement of canine animal control, and the aspca fielded its own force of salaried dogcatchers, whose police-like uniforms added an air of discipline and authority. With its new institu- tional and administrative power, the society ended the system of dog brokerage and theft that had prompted public complaint for decades.15 At one level, the struggle between animal welfare advocates and the city government constituted a typical conflict between reformers, with their vision of virtuous leadership by private citizens, and the urban machine, with its patronage politics.

The granting of police power to a private, voluntary associa- tion might seem unusual, but it was par for the course in the nineteenth century. The aspcas original acquisition of the power to enforce new anticruelty laws in 1 866 was but one manifestation of what William Novak has called "the well-regulated society." More</page><page sequence="12">Voluntary Association, State Power, and Animal Control in New York City 1009 generally, the intermingling of public and private power meant that citizens and local governments did not hesitate to pursue building regulations, sanitary measures, the erad- ication of nuisances, and other efforts in defense of the public welfare. The infamous Comstock Law of 1873, for example, and Anthony Comstock's construction of a power- ful alliance among local antivice organizations, municipal police, and the U.S. Post Office to root out obscenity in all forms that the self-appointed morality police saw fit, dramatically illustrates citizens' participation in the policing of New York City. Urban historians have paid less attention to the police work of the aspca, but the society launched over a hundred anticruelty prosecutions in 1866, and by the 1870s and 1880s it was pursuing thousands of cases every year. In the 1890s animal-welfare advocates' newfound authority over dog catching and the pound rested upon nearly thirty years of experience exercising police power.16 The aspca proudly touted the success of its animal-control operations and the disci- plined performance of its dogcatchers. As the aspca president John P. Haines reported triumphantly at the society's annual meeting in December 1899, "The streets of New York are no longer infested by homeless dogs, and the nights are no longer made hideous by half-wild cats." The public image of dogcatchers changed rapidly from that of rough men dealing in strays and harassing legitimate dog owners to an image of dogcatchers as, at worst, colorful rogues.17 But the aspca's monopoly over dog catching remained uncon- tested for less than a decade. In the early twentieth century, the Department of Health's push for muzzling requirements as an antirabies measure quickly erupted into direct conflict with animal-welfare advocates. Rabies and Bureaucratic Capacity in the Department of Health In the fall of 1885 news that Louis Pasteur had developed preventive rabies vaccination spread rapidly from Paris to the rest of the world. Human victims of dog bites could now seek to build immunity to rabies through a series of injections with attenuated strains of the virus. The typical incubation period of the disease (understood in the late nineteenth century as usually not less than a month, although rabies could develop from facial wounds within days) allowed for post-exposure vaccination with high rates of success. Pasteur's discovery quickly became part of the new lore surrounding germ theory and the power of science to protect human health. For the time being, however, the New York City Department of Health continued to deal with rabies more or less as it had for the previous two decades - by performing the routine work of issuing annual directives, keeping statistics, and responding to dog-bite complaints - but it did not undertake concerted efforts against rabies. For more than a decade following Pasteur's discovery, 16 As the historical literature documents, the depiction of urban politics as morality play was complicated by the periodic ability of urban reformers to win concessions from machine governments more easily than from reform mayoral administrations. Not infrequently, the aspca found a more receptive audience in Tammany Hall than from New York's reform mayors. See, for example, Buffet, "Bergh's War on Vested Cruelty," vol. 5,.

In the 1890s the privately run New York Pasteur Institute played the major role in introducing rabies vaccination to the city, while animal control remained under the newly acquired supervi- sion of the aspca. The parallel efforts of the Pasteur Institute and the aspca defined an urban system of rabies control and prevention carried out primarily by voluntary associa- tions, not the citys public health officials. By the first decade of the twentieth century, however, the public health bureaucracy's newly developed capacities in the production and administration of rabies vaccine, rapid diagnosis of rabies, and animal inspection paved the way for a series of public clashes that established a new level of authority vested in the health department over rabies prevention, but that also preserved the voluntarist efforts of the aspca in everyday practice.18 The Department of Health's determination to tackle rabies prevention stemmed from large-scale scientific, political, and institutional developments that allowed public health departments to reach new levels of activity and stature in the 1890s. Under nineteenth- century jurisprudence, public health constituted the foremost rationale for the exercise of the states regulatory and police power, and municipalities did not hesitate to order protective measures through the citizen-oriented, frequently ad hoc means that defined governance in the early national period. Systematic, long-term, and bureaucratically based enforcement arrived with the expansion of municipal governments in the mid- nineteenth century. New York Citys Metropolitan Board of Health, founded in 1866 and reorganized with new powers as the New York City Board of Health in 1870, immedi- ately earned a lofty reputation for stemming the spread of the 1 866 cholera epidemic, and it quickly became the model for new health departments in Chicago, Milwaukee, and other American cities. Urban and state-level health boards generally experienced rocky fortunes in the 1870s and 1880s, however, as sanitary reformers grappled with the vicis- situdes of party politics and the challenge of demonstrating their ability to deliver health- ier conditions. Historians of public health generally credit the dissemination of germ theory and the growing power of the laboratory in explaining public health departments' vibrant efforts from the 1890s to the 1910s to combat infectious disease, reduce child- hood mortality, improve sanitation, rein in the nuisance trades, ensure greater food safety, and pursue myriad other efforts on behalf of the public's health. In the case of rabies pre- vention, scientific developments undergirded the Department of Health's efforts, but, as we will see, so too did the legal and political currents that challenged, but ultimately did not overturn, the blended public-private relationship of nineteenth-century governance.19 18 On Louis Pasteur's development of preventive rabies vaccination, see Gerald L. Geison, The Private Science of Louis Pasteur (Princeton, 1995), 177-256.

A full account of the New York Pasteur Institute's history has yet to be written, but newspaper coverage from the 1 890s makes clear its central role in introducing rabies vaccination to New York City.

For background on germ theory and the expanded authority of</page><page sequence="14">Voluntary Association, State Power, and Animal Control in New York City 1011 The new commitment of the public health bureaucracy to rabies prevention emanated from the organizational aspirations of Hermann Biggs, the Department of Health's ambitious general medical officer, combined with the scientific work of Anna Wessels Williams, William H. Park's talented second-in-command at the department's research laboratory. Biggs joined the city health department in 1892, and as an advocate of bacteriology, he aggressively pursued the integration of laboratory work into the depart- ment's public health mission. Biggs had traveled to Paris in the fall of 1885 to study Pas- teur's rabies vaccination procedure, and a decade later, with a prominent laboratory infrastructure now in place at the Department of Health, he laid the foundation for a major expansion of rabies work. In 1896 he dispatched Williams to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, mainly to study techniques for producing streptococcus antitoxin but also to learn methods for rabies vaccine production and diagnosis. Williams, a versatile bacteri- ologist and one of the foremost women in American science, had worked with Park to isolate a strain of diphtheria that led to the development of diphtheria antitoxin. In 1895 she had already begun to look into rabies, and she readily took up the assignment at Paris. Her research led to new means of large-scale production of rabies vaccine in 1898, and in 1904 Williams developed techniques for the rapid diagnosis of rabies through patho- logical examination of Negri bodies in brain tissue. In its annual reports for 1905 and 1906 the Board of Health vigorously touted the accomplishments of Williams and other bacteriologists at the research laboratory in rabies diagnosis and preventive treatment.20 A vastly increased patient load accompanied this expansion of the health department's laboratory research and advances in diagnosis. When Pasteur's rabies vaccination procedure arrived in New York City in 1890, Paul Gibier's privately run, philanthropic Pasteur Insti- tute took on primary responsibility for treating patients. Biggs, however, sought to chal- lenge the Pasteur Institute's dominance, and he wanted Williams to learn the techniques for producing and administering the rabies vaccine. As he wrote to Park in July 1896, "I told Dr. Williams to go over the rabies work very carefully and take home some virus. I think we must take this up quietly and when everything is prepared to administer treat- ment, advise the Health Board. It will then be done. Say nothing now." In essence, Biggs hoped to launch an institutional coup and offer rabies vaccination as a fait accompli , which the board would have to support before any complaints could arise from Gibier's outfit.21 public health boards from the 1890s to the 1910s, see, for example, Duffy, History of Public Health in New York City, 91-1 1 1, 238-80; Rosenkrantz, Public Health and the State, 97-127; and Evelynn Maxine Hammonds, Childhood's Deadly Scourge: The Campaign to Control Diphtheria in New York City, 1880-1930 (Baltimore, 1999).

In 1 900 the health department vaccinated or distributed vaccine to just twenty-eight dog-bite victims. Five years later, however, that figure surpassed a hundred, and by 1907 it reached six hundred. Between 1908 and 1913 the department delivered vaccine, on average, to over nine hundred patients a year.22 As we will see, rabies vaccination thus became a major function of the city's public health apparatus precisely during the period that the health department sought stricter controls on dogs. Meanwhile, the board's capacity to deal with animals increased significantly with the deployment of veterinarians to inspect cows and dairies, and to check horses for glanders, a deadly equine respiratory disease that could also infect humans. Cows and horses were essential to the urban economy as sources of food and transportation, and public health officials in New York paid close attention to dairy and stable inspection. By 1907 the amount of animal work had increased to the point that "animal inspection" now consti- tuted a distinct category of the Sanitary Bureaus functions. Although dairies and stables remained its primary focus, the health department's corps of veterinarians also examined dogs involved in dog-bite complaints and dogs suspected of having rabies. Canine exam- inations soon increased dramatically. In 1907 the departments veterinarians examined some 1,100 dogs; that number jumped to over 4,600 in the following year, and the veterinary corps examined thousands of dogs annually in the period leading up to World War I.23 Rabies now mattered to the board, not because the disease posed a health threat any more serious than in the past, but because ambitious public health officials had expanded the work of the laboratory and of animal experts to incorporate rabies prevention into their department's functions. Through diagnostic techniques, vaccination, and animal inspection, the department developed an extensive bureaucratic network that made rabies into a central concern of the agency. Only then, and not before, did New York City's public health bureaucracy decide that dogs on the loose constituted a problem that required its vigorous intervention. Voluntary Associations versus Bureaucratic Authority: Confrontations between the aspca and the Department of Health The Department of Health's newfound commitment to rabies prevention soon led to conflicts with the aspca. Public health authorities sought restrictions on urban dogs that violated animal-welfare advocates' precepts of humane animal control. The first confron- tation came in 1903, when the Board of Health backed a proposed ordinance requiring the muzzling of all dogs on city streets to replace the simple leash law then in force. 22 Oliver, Man Who Lived for Tomorrow ; 1 73; Annual Report of the Board of Health of the City of New York for the Calendar Year 1913 (New York, 1914), 102.

Although both groups believed in the need to cull strays, the aspcas primary concern was protecting dogs from what its members saw as the cruelty of life on the street, with public health as a distinctly secondary benefit of animal control. As opponents of vivisection and other research practices that exploited animals (such as, in their view, the development of vaccines), these activists also tended to downplay the threat of rabies and deny the effec- tiveness of vaccination. Throughout the late 1890s, for example, aspca president John P. Haines emphasized the extreme rarity of rabies, argued that a nervous public too often mistook epilepsy or other conditions as evidence of a mad dog, opined that hydrophobia was largely imaginary, and declared vapor baths, in which patients exposed to steam and high heat supposedly sweated out poisons from their bodies, a sufficient treatment for dog bites. Although the New York Pasteur Institute operated as a philanthropic enterprise, animal-welfare advocates accused the institute of having a pecuniary motive. As Our Animal Friends, the official journal of the aspca, noted in May 1899, "There are men who have a moneyed interest in the dread of hydrophobia. It is their trade to prepare the serum of the so-called Pasteur treatment."24 Despite their antivaccinationist attitudes, aspca officers usually took care to acknowl- edge rabies prevention as a side benefit of canine animal control, and they were not wrong about the extremely low incidence of rabies. But they considered muzzling unnecessary as an antirabies measure and horribly cruel, particularly during the hot summer months when dogs needed most to cool themselves by panting and to freely slake their thirst. In response to the 1903 muzzling proposal, the aspca vociferously argued that the existing leash law provided sufficient protection of public health and that the rareness of rabies in owned dogs did not justify the cruelty of compulsory muzzling. The health department excoriated the aspca for valuing animal protection above human life, and it was this gap in attitudes, more than the effectiveness of the aspcas canine-control efforts, that shaped health officials' determination to contest the power of animal-welfare advocates over man- agement of the urban dog population.25 For the short term, the aspca succeeded in protecting its prerogative as the primary enforcer of the city's dog ordinances. The final version of the new ordinance required muzzles only for owned dogs out on their own, while dogs under human control could be led on a leash. The aspca agreed to enforce the ordinance but warned that the new requirement was only the first step of the "dog haters," who might eventually make certain that "the keeping of dogs in New York" would be "altogether prohibited."26 The debate of 1903 failed to resolve the issue, and five years later, amid a rabies out- break, the aspca and the Board of Health came to blows once more. The board started the year determined to remove stray dogs from New York's streets. At the end of January it passed a sharply worded resolution that condemned stray dogs as "a public nuisance dangerous to life and detrimental to health," prohibited dog owners from allowing their 24 "Champion for 'Mad Dogs,'" New York Times , July 17, 1896, p. 1 1; 'Rabies and Hydrophobia," ibid., July 7, 1897, p. 12.

A second resolu- tion cited twenty-eight human deaths from hydrophobia in 1907 and called for a special appropriation of $15,000 to round up and dispose of stray dogs, treat persons suffering from dog bites, and hire bacteriologists and other personnel required to enforce the dog ordinances. In April aspca superintendent Freel's statements that rabies was largely a disease of the imagination stirred up further controversy and likely made health officials more eager to displace the society. On June 17 the board issued leashing and muzzling requirements to last through October and mandated the destruction of dogs at large. That resolution provided the basis for the board to expand its efforts further at the end of July by establishing a special police force to shoot all unleashed, unmuzzled dogs, whether or not they were licensed or owned.27 The shoot-to-kill order quickly fomented a public uproar. The aspca questioned whether the board had exceeded its discretionary power, and the society's president, Alfred WagstafF, declared the measure "inhumane, unnecessary, in violation of the rights of owners, and a menace to public safety." He indicated that the society would seek judicial review, and a few days later he made his case before the Board of Health. The New York Times , which had long criticized seasonal hysteria and ridiculed animal-control measures applied only in the summer, also objected to the health departments exercise of discretionary authority: "Dr. Walter Bensel [the sanitary superintendent] appears to act on the assumption that, because the Health Department of this city has power to do almost anything in the real or fancied interest of the public health, it should therefore exercise its power to the insane extremity. Unless wielded with discretion and judgment, extreme discretionary powers will certainly be curtailed." Even in an era of expanded bureaucratic authority, the city's public health officials were skirting the limits of their prerogatives. Meanwhile, defenders of dogs also roundly condemned the dog-killing policy on humane grounds. Walter A. Dyer, the managing editor of Country Life in America, went so far as to suggest in a letter to the New York Times that those who carried out the board's orders "could as easily be hired to garrote their poor, old, lame aunt, if she showed symptoms of mumps, which is contagious."28 The deaths of two well-bred, owned, and well-loved dogs raised further the political pres- sure on the Department of Health. On August 4 a policeman shot and wounded a stable owner's dalmation. When the injured animal retreated to the stable, the policeman gave chase and finished her off. C. J. Fendt, the dog's owner, objected to the cruelty of his "well bred and well kept" dog's death. Witnesses, he added, "say it was most pitiful to see the way the poor dog begged to be spared." The aspca launched an investigation, and days later it charged policeman John J. Fitzpatrick with wanton cruelty in the death of Fendt's dog.29 27 Eugene W.

On August 9 the former assistant U.S. attorney Harry Perry Disbecker and Billy II, Disbecker's prize bull terrier valued at $1,000, were on their way to a friend s farm in the countryside. Billy II was wearing a license tag, but no muzzle, when he was shot and killed by someone whom Disbecker identified as a plainclothes policeman. Disbecker, cane in hand, angrily took a swipe at the shooter, who retreated and disappeared into the nearest subway entrance, leaving Disbecker to take poor Billy to the country for burial.30 In a culture where sentimentality toward pets as beloved family members had become well established in middle-class homes by the mid-nineteenth century and had only grown stronger and more widespread with each passing decade, the two dog killings sparked a public relations debacle for the Board of Health. A growing pile of hate mail reached the board, and Sanitary Superintendent Walter Bensel and Health Commissioner Thomas Darlington both received death threats. Rumors swirled that the Board of Health would rescind its order and "recommit the matter of killing dogs" to the aspca. The case against policeman Fitzpatrick added to the pressure, but Darlington dug in his heels and defiantly announced that he was "determined that this order of the board shall be carried out to the letter, no matter who opposes or what Col. Wagstaff, the S.P.C.A., or anybody else says."31 Two days later, however, after a magistrate ruled that Fitzpatrick had acted within the bounds of the Board of Healths authority, the board decided to declare victory, cut its losses, and deny that it had ever sought widespread destruction of people's pets. Now that city residents were taking extra care to prevent their dogs from running loose, the board reasoned, the dog-killing order could be allowed to expire quietly at the end of October, as originally planned. Meanwhile, lest anyone brand Darlington a dog hater, the health commissioner let it be known that he and his staff loved animals as much as anyone else. As the office cat rubbed herself against him, Darlington regaled a reporter with stories about his bug-hunting fox terrier, whom he kept in the country rather than muzzle him in the city. Finally, in its annual report for 1908, the Board of Health recorded its crackdown on dogs at large as a triumph and attributed a significant drop in numbers of dogs diagnosed with rabies "chiefly to the active crusade carried on by the Health Department."32 Six years later, the Board of Health again took aggressive measures against stray dogs and confronted once more the animus of the aspca. In July 1914, in response to another rabies outbreak, Health Commissioner Sigismund Goldwater sought more vigorous 30 "Dog Shot at Theatre Door," ibid,., Aug. 1 1, 1908, p. 5. 31 "Threat to Dr. Bensel," New York Tribune , Aug. 6, 1908, p. 1; "Dr. Bensel Threatened Again," ibid., Aug. 1 1, 1908, p. 4; "Dr. Darlington Laughs at Threat to Kill Him," New York Evening World, Aug. 17, 1908, p. 6; "Beware!

Cases of rabies detected in dogs during the first five months of the year in Manhattan and Queens nearly matched the numbers of cases in those two boroughs for all of 1913, and Goldwater called for a year-round muzzling requirement and a new municipal dog pound to curtail the threat. As described at the outset of this essay, his pronouncement prompted heated exchanges with the aspca and sparked a vig- orous debate among city residents. In a familiar response, animal-welfare advocates denounced the cruelty of muzzling, charged the health department with exaggerating the threat of rabies, and accused the health commissioner of seeking to turn New York into a "dogless city." On September 16, Goldwater responded at length by dismissing his critics as "a few persistent and wrong-headed individuals" who were able to "make a very loud noise," and he argued that 99 percent of New Yorkers were on his side. Goldwater also pointed to the needless human deaths that resulted from the city's failure to take the problem of stray dogs seriously. "If the Department of Health had done its duty fifteen years ago," he declared, 121 deaths from rabies could have been avoided. He continued: "There should be no deaths from rabies, or from any other disease which can be as readily prevented." Goldwater added that he was fond of dogs but "would willingly see every dog in America swept into the sea rather than sacrifice one precious human life."33 In contrast to the confrontational stance of Health Commissioner Darlington and the Department of Health in the summer of 1908, Goldwater struck a conciliatory note as well. When critics fired their broadsides at the mayors office, Goldwater carefully explained the departments position. For example, he told Mrs. A. J. Wells, the secretary of the Woman's Republic Club, that the department sought "to interfere as little as possible with the liberties of citizens," but the circumstances required action and most of the mayor's correspondence "indicate clearly that the sentiment of the community is overwhelmingly in favor of the abolition of rabies by whatever means appear to be necessary." Such outreach, he informed the mayors office, yielded positive results. "A few ladies," he wrote, "have misunderstood the attitude of the Department toward the dumb creatures they love so well, but in almost every instance where an opportunity has been afforded to make a direct explanation, the ladies have ultimately recognized the justice and indeed the necessity of what the Department is doing." Although his remarks betrayed a popular tendency to dismiss animal-welfare advocacy by equating it with women's sentimentality, they also revealed a savvy bureaucrat hard at work shaping a constituency for his agency's policies.34 Goldwater made certain his office replied similarly to other critics. Responses high- lighted broad public support for the Department of Health's antirabies measures and explained that data on dog bites demonstrated the inadequacy of leashes alone to protect the public. In his public statement on September 16, Goldwater also threw a bone to the aspca. Dog owners, he said, had rightly pointed out that stray dogs constituted the pri- 33 "No 'Dogless City' for New Yorkers," New York Times , Aug. 22, 1914, p. 15; Department of Health, "Press Bulletin No. 305," issued for release on Sept. 16, 1914 (microfilm: reel 40), Office of the Mayor, Mitchel, John P.

All responsible citizens, the health commissioner indicated, could contribute to the rational management of the city's health, as long as they submitted themselves to public health officials' oversight and guidance.35 Goldwater's political work paid off. As he reasserted his determination to eradicate rabies from the city, rumors circulated that the mayor was about to demand his resigna- tion. The mayor instead publicly and resolutely backed his health commissioner. Public opinion toward the department also seemed more favorable than it had been in 1908, despite concerns of dog owners and animal-welfare advocates that Goldwater planned a general crusade against urban dogs. The New York Times, which had long advocated a year-round dog ordinance, applauded Goldwater's measures and, in contrast to its assess- ment of the dog-kill order six years earlier, did not contend that the board had exceeded its proper bounds. The Board of Health also earned backing from important professional communities, including from the president of the Veterinary Medical Association, who publicly lauded Goldwater's efforts at the organization's annual meeting.36 Over the next few years the Board of Health triumphantly reported dramatic declines in the number of rabid dogs found on city streets and a concomitant reduction in human deaths from hydrophobia. As the board observed in its annual report for 1915, "Better control of dogs and almost complete prevention of human rabies, have followed the co-operation of the police and the courts in the enforcement of the muzzling and removal ordinances and a considerable publicity campaign." The following spring the health department launched a publicity blitz and an initiative to arrest and fine owners of unmuzzled dogs as a way to maintain vigilance, and it reported salutary results. Not only did New Yorkers suffer fewer dog bites in 1916, but the department identified and destroyed just twenty- three rabid dogs, as compared to the already low number of 1 1 5 the previous year. In 1917 New York experienced only three human deaths from rabies, and none of the cases originated from rabid dogs in the city that year (two of the three victims came from outside New York, and the third, from Queens, had been bitten the previous year). The following year witnessed no rabies deaths at all, a pleasant fact that the Department of Health attributed to "the thoroughness with which the muzzling ordi- nance is enforced, the result of prompt local treatment of wounds inflicted by suspected animals, and the thorough and prompt Pasteur treatment carried out in appropriate cases by this bureau." Professional and bureaucratic authority, it seemed, had emerged victorious over rabies.37 35 For Goldwater's explanations of the health department's rationale, see, for example, Secretary to the Commis- sioner to Dr. Hyatt Lyke, Sept. 19, 1914 (microfilm: reel 40), Office of the Mayor, Mitchel, John P.

Closer attention to conflicts over the nature and scope of the police power disrupts a tidy narrative of the ascendance of expertise and bureaucratic authority in at least two respects. First, it reveals how legal developments, and not just the ability to mobilize science, aided the public health bureaucracy in gaining greater authority over rabies prevention and treat- ment. Second, and more significantly, it underscores the limitations of the Department of Healths ability to monopolize authority over canine animal control in New York City. In the early twentieth century, especially during the era after the Lochner v. New York (1905) decision, the aspca faced new legal challenges to its dog-licensing and animal-control prerogatives. In Lochnery the Supreme Court famously ruled that a state law to protect bak- ers' health by limiting their work hours violated freedom of contract, and ever since, stan- dard analyses have identified the decision with a new political and legal order that privileged an extreme conception of individual economic liberty over nineteenth-century interpreta- tions of the police power and its broad exercise for the public good. Lochner s strictures on police power for the purposes of protecting public health and safety were far from abso- lute, however. The courts ultimately preserved legal space for the aspcas law enforcement functions, which produced an accommodation between the Department of Health and the aspca, rather than an outright victory for bureaucratization, professionalization, and modernization of the American state. The aspca retained a share of the police power as part of a political order that continued to blend public and private authority.38 From the aspcas perspective in the 1900s and 1910s, however, the society's hold on canine animal control was far from certain. The Department of Health's efforts to wrest dog-catching and rabies-prevention responsibilities away from the aspca coincided with legal changes that also threatened the society's hold on public authority. In February 1901 the New York State Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled unconstitutional a law that granted local animal-welfare organizations the power to issue dog licenses. The decision in Fox v. Mohawk and Hudson River Humane Society cited a vagueness in the relevant state statute that amounted to a taking of "money or property from one citizen and its appro- priation to another for its private use," which violated the proper application of the power of taxation. The court also identified an unconstitutional grant of "an exclusive privilege and immunity" to the local humane society, because the law allowed the society's pound to hold dogs without taking out licenses on them. The court's decision, however, recognized the complex nature of public-private relationships, in which, for example, the state granted public funds to private charities for the maintenance of orphanages, asylums for the deaf and blind, and correctional facilities for juvenile delinquents. The court also acknowledged the mixed character of volunteer fire departments, which were neither wholly public nor wholly private, but whose century-long tradition of service reflected an acceptable delega- tion of police power. Nonetheless, it ruled that the grant of dog-licensing authority to the Mohawk and Hudson River Humane Society lay outside acceptable legal boundaries.39 38 Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905).

Nonetheless, the cases worrisome precedent led the society to seek revisions from the state legislature to the citys shelter and licensing laws, as well as a detailed legal analysis from Charles Andrews, a former chief justice of the Court of Appeals. Andrews concluded that the aspca s authority could survive judicial scrutiny and that the specific legal issues that had doomed the states general statute did not apply to the special charter under which the aspca operated. The society legitimately exercised the police power of the state, he reasoned, and although technically private in character, it was public in its purposes and in effect constituted "a subordinate public agency to perform a service which the Legislature might delegate to a citizen or public body."40 These maneuvers took place just months before the Department of Health attempted its 1 903 coup against the aspca, and taken together, these developments indicated new pressures on the public authority of voluntary associations. Public health officials also cast their arguments against the aspca in terms of the proper exercise of public authority. In early 1906, for example, when New York City health commissioner Thomas Darlington backed a bill to transfer the aspcas dog-licensing power to the city health department, he labeled the aspcas licensing franchise a form of "graft," calling "the collection of such fees by a private association . . . unconstitutional." Health officials increasingly believed that public agencies run by professional experts, rather than private organizations composed of well-meaning citizens, should possess authority over public health policy.41 Darlington's legislative gambit failed, but in 1908, just as the Department of Health was seeking a new round of rabies prevention measures, the aspca faced mounting legal attacks on its dog-licensing power from other sources. In January 1908 the aspca picked up Brian Boru, a well-bred Irish terrier who belonged to Bird S. Coler, Brooklyn's borough president. The aspca released the dog upon a promise from Coler's son that his father would pay later, but Coler reneged out of skepticism about the dog-licensing law's constitutionality. Four months later, an aspca agent encountered Brian Boru on the streets again, still tagless, and sent him to the pound. Coler again refused to pay the fine and licensing fee, and when the society threatened to euthanize Brian Boru if he were not reclaimed, Coler went to court for a temporary injunction that would preserve his dog's life while he challenged the constitutionality of the state's dog-licensing statutes.42 At one level the legal wrangling symbolized the old conflict between reformers and the political machine, but that struggle now took place in a context of changing municipal bureaucratic authority and new legal skepticism about delegation of police power. Justice William J. Kelly of the Brooklyn Supreme Court heard the case in June, took it under advisement, and granted Coler his injunction in October. Kelly's opinion analyzed the question of police power at length. Kelly first recognized the legitimacy of the state's 40 "The Shelter Law Amended," Our Animal Friends, 29 (May 1902), 193; "Legal and Constitutional Status of the A.S.P.C.A.," ibid., 30 (Jan. 1903), 98-102, esp. 100; aspca, Thirty-Ninth Annual Report for the Year Ending December 31, 1904 (New York, 1905), 143-58. 41 "Attacks S.P.C.A.

"The act in question," he wrote, "is based on the police power of the state for the protection of the citizens from hydrophobia." Indeed, Kelly indicated that he had delayed issuing his decision for several months "in deference to the suggestion . . . that the continuation of the injunction would in some way interfere with the work of defendant in destroying mad dogs during the summer months, and because of the assertion that the inhabitants of the city of New York have no protection from mad dogs except through defendant and its agents." Up to this point, Justice Kelly's analysis provided a classic statement of nineteenth-century jurispru- dence and its understanding of the police powers broad application in the protection of the salus populi (peoples welfare). He then turned to his reservations, especially his skepti- cism of the legitimacy of delegating police power to a private organization. He explained: I do not believe that the Legislature can vest any such power as is sought to be conferred here in a private corporation. The agents who go into the streets of the city and seize these animals are not public officers It is a misdemeanor to interfere with these per- sons. They are described in the act as officers and agents of the society. They are vested with powers greater, in some respects, than public officers bound by oath and responsible to the public. I think the public health should be protected by the state or the munici- pality, acting through their duly designated representatives, r . . great danger may result from delegating to these private corporations duties which belong to the public and which should be performed by public officers. The Legislature may delegate duties to individuals which cannot be delegated to corporations. Without questioning the good that has been done in many cases by such associations, when it comes to interference with the person or property of the individual, I doubt whether the principle is right.43 43 Coler v. aspca at 549, 552.

The reader should also note that under New York's judicial system, the state supreme courts are, in fact, trial courts.</page><page sequence="24">Voluntary Association, State Power, and Animal Control in New York City 1021 This passage powerfully illustrates the shifting conception in American law and politics at the turn of the century of the police power and the nature of public authority. First, Kellys sense that the aspca's power to interfere "with the person or property of the individual" might invalidate the society's dog-licensining functions reflected a new emphasis on individual rights as a rationale for constraining the police power. Although post -Lochner jurisprudence promoted greater skepticism about the states regulatory authority in general, and not just delegated authority, its formalistic reading of law had particularly threatening implications for the informal, ad hoc style of nineteenth-century arrangements that blended public and private authority. The delegation of the police power common in the nineteenth century now came under question before an increas- ingly vigorous discourse of individualism, especially regarding individual property rights. Second, in positing that responsibility for protection of public health rested with the state or city government and that the government's "duly designated representatives" could no longer include voluntary associations such as the aspca, Kelly expressed an increasingly prevalent understanding that modern government properly operated through profes- sional administration and not as an expression of civic obligation or contribution.44 While the aspca wrangled with Coler, the Department of Health attempted to take advantage of the situation. When the department sought an expanded appropriation for rabies prevention in January 1908, it cited, in what was apparently a mistaken reference to the Fox case, its belief that "the statute authorizing the collection of licenses by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been declared unconstitu- tional." In the fall, immediately after the Brooklyn court issued its injunction in Coler, Health Commissioner Darlington revived the idea of having his department take primary responsibility for animal control and using income from dog licensing (which would be paid directly to the city rather than the aspca) to employ the aspca under contract. As one measure of the seriousness of the legal threat to the aspca's authority, Alfred Wagstaff, the society's president, indicated that he would consider Darlington's proposed subordi- nation of the society to the Department of Health.45 Instead, the aspca decided to seek clarification through the courts. Coler apparently dropped his case, but the society continued to face other legal challenges, with mixed outcomes. In the fall of 1910 a local magistrate in Queens applied Justice Kelly's prece- dent in ruling the aspca's power to issue dog licenses unconstitutional and declaring that his court would no longer issue summonses or warrants to the society's agents. The fol- lowing summer, however, the New York Supreme Court found the aspca's dog-licensing 44 Coler v. aspca at 552.

Westbay v. Delaney. Although the court observed that the state legislature "has not the right to vest in private associations authority and power affecting the life, liberty and property of citizens, except in a few special instances," the legislature possessed an "undoubted right to employ private associations and individuals in a purely administrative capacity." This emphasis on the limited circum- stances in which the state could delegate the police power suggested a narrower range of action than that allowed under the nineteenth-century tradition of the well-regulated society, but the decision still recognized the aspca's legitimacy.46 As a lower court decision, however, The People ex rel. Westbay provided no definitive resolution. The acquisition of greater power over canine animal control by the Depart- ment of Health in 1914 occurred within this context of legal uncertainty for the aspca. Then in 1917 a new state law placed dog licensing under the authority of town and city clerks in smaller municipalities defined as second or third class. The law did not apply to New York City, a first-class municipality, but it indicated a significant statewide decline in the police powers of animal-welfare organizations.47 Finally, in December 1920 the U.S. Supreme Courts decision in Nicchia v. People of the State of New York settled the constitutional question in the aspca's favor. Mary Nicchia was charged in the fall of 1916 with violating New York City's dog-licensing statute. Although her guilt was affirmed at every stage of the process, Nicchia appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which found the citys dog-licensing law "within the police power of a State." Although courts now subjected the police power to extra close scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment and its restrictions on states' power to deprive citizens of property and liberty, the New York statute passed muster. First, the Court observed, "Property in dogs is of an imperfect or qualified nature and they may be subjected to peculiar and drastic police regulations by the State without depriving their owners of any federal right." The common- law tradition that considered dogs in an intermediate position between wild animals and useful domesticated animals opened dogs to more extensive regulation than other forms of property. The Court then ruled that the reasonable delegation of the state's power to regulate dogs "to a corporation created by it for the express purpose of aiding in law enforcement" also posed "no infringement of any right guaranteed to the individual by the federal Constitution." As with the New York Supreme Courts 1911 decision in The People ex rel. Westbayy the U.S. Supreme Courts ruling in Nicchia suggested a reduced range of the states police power as compared to nineteenth-century practice, but those limits still contained considerable scope for delegation of power to voluntary associations such as the aspca.48 Conclusion Traditional historical writing about the American state, with its heavy focus on social welfare policy and economic regulation, has rendered dog catching and other forms of everyday governance invisible or trivial in a grand narrative concerned with the rise of administrative power and the emergence of a strong federal government.

That history must still acknowledge the profound changes in the growth of bureaucratic authority and the emergence of federal power since the late nineteenth century, but it also needs to recog- nize the persistence of localized forms of governance that embodied complex, messy arrangements between public and private. In the case of the aspca, close judicial scrutiny of the police power and administrative agencies' new willingness to challenge voluntary asso- ciations' authority created instability where before none had existed. Yet the society emerged from the litigation of the 1910s with its police power intact. Although in subsequent decades the society continued to face political attacks that it benefitted from an inappro- priate delegation of power by the state, it adapted creatively to shifting circumstances and developed new kinds of arrangements with the institutions of city government. By the late 1970s, as the costs of animal control and maintenance of shelters outpaced dog- licensing revenue, the Department of Health even temporarily subsidized the aspcas operations, until the city government stepped in with more permanent funding. In the 1980s keeping up the aspcas animal-control functions required the input of the city government, borough presidents, the state legislature, private donors, as well as the soci- ety itself; in 1989 the aspca and the city government arranged to issue a $22.8 million bond to support the construction of new facilities. When the aspca gave up dog licensing and animal control in 1995, it did so not because of objections to the wielding of public authority by private organizations, but because of chronic underfunding, combined with an attitudinal shift against the destruction of healthy strays. The aspca retained the authority to enforce the city's anticruelty laws, however, as do animal protection societies in countless other jurisdictions across the United States.49 The history of canine animal control from the mid-nineteenth century to the end of World War I and beyond reveals the long-term continuity of blended relations of public and private that define multiple spheres of governance in the United States. One need only to consider the multitudinous organizations deemed "quasi-governmental" or "semi-municipal" to understand that the aspcas history is far from exceptional. As Matthew Lassiter commented at a recent academic forum, even the history of late twentieth- century "privatization" has to be understood not as the opposite of statism, but as another form of statism, given that law, public policy, and public authority undergird homeowners' associations, citizens' police organizations, and all manner of other supposedly private arrangements.50 49 For complaints that continued to emphasize inappropriate delegation of power, see, for example, "Janitors Dog Back in Form of an Issue," New York Times, Feb. 6, 1930, p. 15; "City Again Dooms Unleashed Dogs," ibid., Aug. 11, 1944, p. 16; "A.S.P.C.A.

Public and private, like oil and water, actually do mix, in an emulsion that suspends their rela- tionship in a constant state of negotiation and renegotiation. Contemporary political rhetoric notwithstanding, public and private are not opposites. They are mutually consti- tutive, and deeper historical understanding of their convoluted dynamic offers possibili- ties not simply for scholarship but for breaking out of the unproductive posturing that pits citizens against government so frequently in American political discourse today.
