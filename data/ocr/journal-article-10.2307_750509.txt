<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE ELUSIVE AMULETS By A. A. Barb ach of the three amulets I am dealing with in the following pages raises questions to which I am unable to give conclusive answers. Can we connect the cameo (I) with a certain lady known from an historical source? Are we entitled to assume an inclusion of the figure of Christ into magico- religious syncretism of the Roman upper classes as early as the first century A.D.? What was the material of the Byzantine amulet (II), known only from one (or two?) electrotype copies, with its curious combination of Christian, Jewish and Egyptian elements? and what could Christians of the sixth century see in the figure of 'Horus on the crocodiles' of late Egyptian religion and magic? To which part of Europe or the Near East and to which century A.D. can we ascribe the leather amulet (III) and what is the meaning-if there is any-of its inscriptions in an unknown alphabet? However inconclusive the commentary I am able to give, the three amulets, each as far as I can see unique in its kind, most certainly deserve publication. I and III are in private hands and might not easily come to the attention of interested scholars, while the electrotype (II), although known and referred to since 1900oo, has never been adequately reproduced and the whereabouts not only of the original but also of the copy, made in the last decade of the nineteenth century for the Mediaeval Department of the Hermi- tage, is apparently nowadays unknown.' Perhaps better scholars may take up the problems where I must leave them and may produce in due course more satisfactory explanations. I. A GNOSTIC' CAMEO The sum total of so-called 'Gnostic' or 'Abraxas' gems-a better name would be 'magic' or 'amuletic' gems2-in public and private collections would certainly run into five figures. They are all intagli, i.e. they show incised figures and/or inscriptions like seals although, as the lettering clearly in- dicates, they were never intended for sealing, which would have turned the inscriptions the wrong way round. There exists, however, at least one cameo belonging to this class of monument.3 I know of its existence through the kindness of Professor Andreas Alf6ldi, who discovered it in the collection of the late Regierungsrat Leo Merz in Berne and who also sent me the photo- graphs reproduced in Pls. I a, b. I have to thank Miss Eva Merz for supplying details of material and measurement and for kindly permitting me to publish this important gem. 1 Cf. K. Preisendanz in Pauly-Wissowa, R.E., Suppl. viii, 1956, Col. 68I f. 2 For a general survey of this class of gems see my article in Enciclopedia dell'arte antica classica e orientale, iii, i960, pp. 971-74. 3 The Vienna half-sculpture of the child Horus, cut from emerald-matrix with Horus on the Lotus-flower and Greek amuletic in- scription engraved on its back (cf. F. Eichler- E. Kris, Die Kameen im kunsthistorischen Museum, Vienna, I927, p. 73 f., no. 52) I should not call a cameo proper, as it lacks a background. It rather belongs to the same class of small sculpture cut in semi-precious stones as the haematite 'figurine' of a hawk with magic inscription in the Louvre (cf. A. Dain, Inscrip- tions grecques du Muse'e du Louvre. Les textes inidits, 1933, P. I78 if., no. 204). I</page><page sequence="2">2 A. A. BARB The cameo is made from a sardonyx of three layers, the figure and the two letters on the obverse appearing milky-white on a bluish background, and the reverse being brown. Its size is 3.6 x 2.7 cm., the maximum thick- ness 0.8 cm. The obverse shows the familiar figure of the god Hermes or Mercurius in frontal view, slightly turned to the left, with chlamys fastened on his right shoulder, winged cap and wings on his ankles, the kerykeion resting on his bent left arm, and holding a tortoise on his outstretched right hand. On either side of the figure we see a Greek letter: Theta and Chi. The reverse shows the following inscription carefully engraved in nine lines: IAL3 ABPACAC AALO NAIA FIONONOM (5) AAEIlAIAY NAMIC+YA A ATCOYE BIANTnAY AEINAN There are two or three obvious mistakes for which the engraver is probably to blame. The first letter in line 5 should be A (Alpha) not A (Lambda); the C (Sigma) in line 7 should be an E (Epsilon); in both cases the horizontal stroke of the letter has been left out. The unusual cross-form of what should be the letter 0 (Phi) in line 6 might be a similar mistake; the cross-bar is set so low down that it seems intended to be completed by a parallel bar above it with the two bars connecting on both sides. The only other abnormality is in line 2: ABPACAC instead of the usual ABPACAE. With these emendations the inscription reads: 'ltac 'AppCacr 'AScova &amp;yiov 6voai 'AE?lca 80ivapis qVuXdOiarE Outplcay 1TTavEivav 'Iao Abrasax Adonai, holy name Aexiai, power, preserve Vebia [Vibia? Baebia?] Paulina!' This is one of the usual Greek magic invocations with their frequent strongly Jewish flavour,4 quite intelligible except for the vox magica 'Aexiai' which I have met nowhere else.5 4 For lao, the widely used Greek transcrip- tion of the Hebrew YHWH cf. this Journal, XVI, 1953, p. 216, n. 44 (and p. 227, n. 153), also M.

Adanai = Hebrew 'My Lord' is still substi- tuted today by orthodox Jews, when reciting, for the name YHWH which must not be pronounced. 'In rabbinic sources of the first and second centuries the name Dynamis was widely used as a synonym for God Himself, the esoteric use continued in the circles of the Merkabah mystics' (G. Scholem, Jewish Gnos- ticism, Merkabah Mysticism and Talmudic tradi- tion, 1960, p. 67 ; Scholem also gives references to the similar use in the N.T.; cf. also G.

Bonner, Studies in magical amulets, Ann Arbor, 1950, p. 225 and n. 65); TEY1 occurs in a magic formula given by Alexander Trallianus (cf. R. Heim, Incantamenta magica graeca latina, no. 204); TIXIAY (in tabula ansata underneath lion-headed god) on a jasper intaglio in Florence (Inv. no. 2948); AY1I is known as lucky acclamation in imperial times (cf.

The tortoise, although one of his less frequent attributes, is sufficiently well attested on other works of art repre- senting Hermes6 and is usually connected with the myth of his invention of the lyre.' But what of the mysterious letters e and X and the exorcism on the reverse, both of which we must take as related to this image of Hermes? Admittedly there are instances where genuine or faked magical inscriptions and sometimes also crude magical representations have been added in more recent times to genuine antique intaglios and cameos.8 But I feel quite sure that this is not the case here. The form of letters suggests the first century A.D., just as does the execution of the obverse, and would have looked rather dif- ferent in later centuries, not to speak of the work of Renaissance forgers, who in any case would not have been able to compose such a meaningful, correct text.9 Besides this, the two letters on the obverse could not possibly have been added after the cutting of the cameo and must be related to the Hermes figure. There are few Graeco-Roman divinities of such protean significance as Hermes-Mercurius. He is the divine messenger and the psychopompos as well as the god of business success-both honest and dishonest. He turns up as the interpretatio Romana of various Celtic, Germanic and other foreign local deities. He is identified with the Egyptian Anubis who takes care of the dead but also with the Egyptian Thot who, as Hermes Trismegistos, becomes the great mediator and the teacher of all secret and divine wisdom. We should, of course, be inclined to see the latter meaning on a magic gem and the letter e could be interpreted as the initial of Thot; but with Thot I am at a loss to connect a word starting with X; to read XEAcVvn (=- tortoise) and to explain the legend as 'Thot's tortoise' would hardly appeal to anybody. Apart from its connection with the invention of the lyre and occasional symbolism of fertility and pregnancy (which belongs more correctly to frog and toad)10 Shearim shows, the form &amp;'co was occasion- ally used for aOic (see B. Lifschitz in Revue Biblique, lxviii, 1961, p. 401 f.). We also know EAKAI and YEIAl as names of the Elkasaite Gnosis, cf. E. S. Drower, The secret Adam, a study of Nasoraean Gnosis, 1960, passim (see Index)-perhaps (so G. Scholem, op. cit., p. 67, n. 7) 'the hidden dynamis' or (cf. R. Macuch in Oriental. Literaturzeitung, lvi, 1961, col. 383, n. 4) 'the hidden God'? 6 Cf., e.g., the intaglio pl. vii, no. 570 in P. Fossing, The Thorwaldsen Museum. Catalogue of the antique engraved gems and cameos, Copen- hagen, 1929, and the references, ibid., p. 100oo. 7 There was also the story of a house-bound virgin Chelone who, summoned by Hermes to attend the wedding of Zeus and Hera refused to do so and was punished by being transformed into a tortoise, thus carrying her house always about-cf. Roscher, Mythol. Lex., i, 892. 8 The inscription of the haematite hawk in the Louvre (see above, n. 3) appears, accord- ing to Dain, to have been added centuries later. The 'gnostic' figure and characters on the reverse of a cameo in the Royal collection of gems at Windsor Castle (obverse reprod. by A. B. Tonnochy in The Connoisseur Corona- tion Book, 1953, p. 57) is probably the addition of a Renaissance engraver or still later. The same is evidently the case with the nonsensical 'magic' lettering on the reverse of a cameo in Vienna (Eichler-Kris, op. cit., no. 20, p. 62, fig. 24) and the 'Abraxas'-figure with faked inscription on a sixteenth-century Italian cameo in the Milton Weil Collection (see Catalogue ... by E. Kris, Vienna, 1932, p. 16 and pl. v, fig. 14). 9 See, e.g., this Journal, XVI, 1953, p. 219, n. 67. 10 Cf. the references in this Journal, l.c., p. 214, n. 23 (Kris, Deonna, Lesky) and now</page><page sequence="4">4 A. A. BARB the tortoise usually is a sinister, negative symbol, connected with darkness and the Underworld." Is our Hermes then the guide to the Nether World and should eE6s X86vios be read? But an amulet to open the way to Tartarus could hardly have been to the liking of the Roman lady for whom it was manufactured. (Cf. also below, n. 37.) There is, however, still another meaning for the tortoise, viz. as symbol for the Universe, the Kosmos. Although, as far as I can see, this meaning is unequivocally attested only in India, the Far East and Ancient America, it has been convincingly suggested that we must accept it for Graeco-Roman works of art too, at least in the case of Aphrodite Urania, represented by Phidias as resting her foot on the tortoise.12 The tortoise on the altar of Mercurius Avernus at Leyden has been similarly explained.13 Thus the type of Hermes holding the tortoise on his outstretched hand would closely resemble the familiar representation of Helios holding the globe in similar fashion, characterizing him as Hermes Kosmokrator, a conception well attested by the magic papyri.14 Very much as in these magic hymns in Egyptian grimoires, Hermes and Helios appear fused into one and the same popular deity in Syria,15 a deity with an established cult and public sanctuaries, while the Graeco-Egyptian Hermes Trismegistos always remained more or less a god of mystics, theosophists and philosophers. This Syrian aspect of Hermes might even be much older than the 'classical' conceptionl6 and could reveal the original meaning of his tortoise-attribute, while the myth of the invention of the lyre (a somewhat illogical duplication of the same invention by Apollo) also R.

Kerenyi, Hermes der Seelenfithrer ( = Albae Vigiliae, N.F. I, Ziurich, 1944). Only now are we gradually realizing the importance of older, oriental beliefs and mythology for the formation of the considerably younger 'classical' Greek religion-cf., e.g., Elements orientaux dans la religion grecque ancienne (Col- loque de Strasbourg 1958), Paris, 1960. Much that we are accustomed to see classified as late 'syncretism' is rather the ancient and original, deep-seated popular religion, com- ing to the surface when the whitewash of 'classical' writers and artists began to peel off, cf. my remarks in 'Noreia und Rehtia', Beitrdge zur ilteren europdischen Kulturgeschichte</page><page sequence="5">THREE ELUSIVE AMULETS 5 and the rather insipid story of the housebound woman (see above, n. 7) would be later explanations of an attribute which was no longer understood." The invocation of Hermes as "IAO' [ =YHWH] Bringer of Light' in a magic papyrus18 might not mean much in the syncretistic muddle of these texts. But there is a group of magic intagli which seem to suggest more strongly an interpretatio iudaica of the god Hermes. These stones show a human figure whose body and limbs are covered with lettering, partly well-known angel names, voces magicae, or formulae, partly the usual magic permutations of the seven vowels. Two of these stones (there are nine known to me) 19 characterize the figure clearly as Hermes (cf. here Pls. Ic-e).20 Now the only explana- tion for these so far unexplained inscribed figures seems to me to be found in the Cabbalistic (or perhaps better 'Jewish-Gnostic') secret lore of the Shiur Komah,21 which describing God in stark anthropomorphic terms gives not -Festschrift fiir Rudolf Egger, i, Klagenfurt, 1952, P. 173 ff., or F. v.

Good- enough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman period, ii, 1953, p. 269, and more completely by C. Bonner, 'A miscellany of engraved stones', Hesperia, xxiii, 1954, P-. 151 ff. Bonner describes a stone in the Art Museum, Prince- ton University (40-392), adds five others from older publications (1-5) and mentions [6] a stone published by Caylus which he thinks is a forgery. But he did not realize that the stones 2 (publ. by Spon) and [6] are now both in the Cabinet des Medailles in Paris where I was able to examine them thoroughly and there cannot be a doubt that [6] (published by Caylus with a very correct drawing) is genuinely antique. Two further stones of this group, which escaped Bonner's attention, are-I am counting the Princeton intaglio as [7]-no. 3469 in A. de Ridder's Catalogue de la Collection De Clercq, vii, 2 (19I1) = [8], and a gem published (from the collection of Luigi Firrao) by G. Minervini, 'Poche osservazioni intorno ad un pietra Basilidiana', in Bullettino archeologico napolitano, N.S., no. II0, Febr. 1857, pp. 89-91 and pl. vii/3, = [9]. It seems interesting that of these nine stones five are cut in amethyst (not often used for Gnostic gems) and two in rock crystal-which also might have been ori- ginally amethyst; its colour tends to fade gradually when exposed to light, a fact known to Pliny ('ad vicina crystalli descendit albicante purpurae defectu', N.H. xxxvii, 123). This affinity of amethyst and rock crystal appears also in a Hebrew list of gems of the fourteenth century, where we also read that this is the stone of the tribe of Gad and useful in war as well as against demons and spirits: cf. J. Trachtenberg, Jewish magic and superstition, 1939, PP. 138 and 266. Three of these nine gems show on the reverse the familiar solar emblem of the Lion. 20 P1.

As regards the inscribed snake held by all seven of these Gnostic figures I should see some connexion with the Syrian Hermes as 'deus bonus puer Phosphorus (Azizus)' who holds the serpent which symbolizes the course of the sun-cf. R. Dussaud in Syria, xxiii, 1942/43, PP. 74- 75. But compare also the cabbalistic primeval serpent, 'the great servant of the creation', whose 'head surmounted the heighths of the earth and whose tail descended into the depths of Hell' (G. Scholem, 'Gut und B6se in der Kabbala', Eranos-Jahrbuch, xxx, 1961, p. 57). Here, I think, we find a more likely explanation than Hermes = Michael con- quering the dragon-cf. W. Lueken, Michael, G6ttingen, 1898, p. 27 f. and 78 f. 21 Cf. The Jewish Encyclopedia, xi, 1907, p. 298. G. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, MIer- kabah Mysticism and Talmudic Tradition, 1960, p. 36 ff.

The small size of the engraved gems enforced, of course, a restric- tion of the inscriptions to a mere suggestion of what was meant (not to mention the corruptions due to the ignorance of the engravers),22 but I feel sure that this Gnostic Jewish doctrine must be responsible for these strange representa- tions. It seems highly significant, that on the two (or three) stones where the figure shows some characterization beyond merely human forms23 it is repre- sented as Hermes.24 If the oldest forms of Shiur Komah speculation developed not in Egypt but in Palestine or Syria25 this would point to the same environ- ment in which we find Hermes-Helios-Kosmokrator. Similarly, I think, we must evaluate the appearance of Hermes in Aramaic incantations from Babylonia.26 Here Hermes is identified with the Logos, with Metatron (in Jewish mysticism the highest of the angels, the divine mediator and, as it were, hypostasis of God himself), even with 'YAH' [= YHWH].27 These are conceptions which can hardly be explained from the Graeco- Egyptian Hermes Trismegistos doctrines,28 but rather from Jewish-Syrian, perhaps Chaldaean, esoteric traditions.29 I should see the same background in the Greek inscription on a pottery lamp of early imperial times, found in Dioscurias-Sebastopolis (east of the Euxine, now U.S.S.R.) and obviously a in der Kabbala', Eranos-Jahrbuch, xxix, 196o (1961), p. 139 ff., esp. p. 145 ff. 22 Still, these antique intagli-hardly later than the third century A.D.-should be an important help for explaining details given in mediaeval manuscripts of the Shiur Komah (none earlier than the I Ith cent.), a task which G. Scholem (Eranos-Jahrbuch, l.c., p. 148) described as 'fast hoffnungslos'. P.G.M., Pap. v, 435 mentions the 'name of Hermes (consisting of) hundred letters'-analogous to the secret name of the Jewish God-but fails to write it down. 23 The Princeton gem published by Bonner (see above, n. 19) shows the mysterious figure in Persian costume-actually in almost exactly the same attire as the god facing King Antiochos I of Commagene (d. 34 B.c.) on the famous relief of Nemrud-Dagh in Syria, a god called in the inscription 'Apollo- Mithras-Helios-Hermes', see F. Saxl, Mithras, 1931, p. 3 and pl. I, fig. 5; M. J. Vermaseren, Corpus inscript. et monument. religionis Mithraicae, i, 1956, p. 53 f., no. 30 and fig. 5; T. Nagy in Acta Antiqua Acad. Scient.

Saxl's aside (op. cit., p. vi), 'der Mithriazismus erscheint uns heute fast als eines der gnostischen Systeme'. On Hermes-Mithras cf. also below, note 44. 24 It might be relevant to mention that after Helios (who is competing with the ubiquitous Jewish lao Sabaoth Adonai) no Greek deity is invoked nearly as often as Hermes in the magic papyri, cf. M. Nilsson, 'Die Religion der griechischen Zauber- papyri, Bull. de la soc. roy. des lettres de Lund, 1947-48/ii, p. 68 f. (and 63)- 25Thus Scholem, Eranos-Jahrbuch, xxix, p. 151. 26 See J. A.

G. Roeder, Hermopolis 1929-1939, Hildesheim, 1959, P- 163 ff.) shows in Graeco-Roman times a certain affinity to the Syrian-Aramaean Hermes, and the important magic Hermes- Invocation, Preisendanz, P.G.M., ii, p. 45 f. (Pap. viii, I ff.) is a remarkable combination of Egyptian and Syrian (orJewish?) elements.

We find the same two letters on an 'Abraxas'- stone reproduced in the seventeenth-century work of Macarius (L'Heureux) and Chiflet.32 At first glance this gem seems a fake (cf. here P1. ig). The crown33 and the form of the chalice are obviously not antique. But we never know in these old illustrations what suspect details are due to an ignorant draftsman working after a more or less crude sketch or blurred impression. A comparison of this stone with our cameo leaves hardly a doubt that both follow an identical pattern, which is most obvious in the position of the figure and drapery of the garment as well as in the arrangement of the two letters. There must therefore have existed at least one antique magic gem-stone besides our cameo (and probably more than one) of this kind of figure with the letters E X. It could have been a Hermes with a tortoise or (if the radiated crown-although differently shaped-were really there) Helios holding some kind of globe, which the draftsman (or perhaps some Renaissance engraver adding an ill-conceived 'improvement') changed into the chalice; there might even have been the whip, which Helios usually holds in his left hand, and which, since it consists of two rather thin lines, could have vanished in the stone-impression or been overlooked by the draftsman. Chiflet34 offers an interpretation of this stone which is as abstrusely learned as it is absurd. According to him the figure is Bacchus, e means 'condemnation' and X 'absolution'. For the radiated crown he refers to Liber pater = Apollo (according to Macrobius) and the chalice reminds him of Gnostic rituals-a tour deforce which was rejected by Montfaucon, who suggests another explana- tion, namely Theos Christos.35 The same explanation of e X was offered, inde- pendently of Montfaucon, by a remarkable scholar of the eighteenth century, P. E. Jablonski, who stressed the fact that the Gnostics liked to represent Christ as the Sun(-god).36 There are, of course, any number of possibilities for explaining two initials which are not a familiar abbreviation."'

A. BARB are to be reduced to mere guesswork I think OEbs Xpio-r6s-'the God Christ' might be the likeliest interpretation for our cameo and for Chiflet's specimen.

The idea of Christ as Mediator, as Messenger of the highest God could in itself have suggested a more general identification with Hermes.39 Besides this, Hermes as the Young God, the God-Son, well expressed the widespread feeling of an age which, tired of the remote old gods, expected salvation from the birth of the divine child,40 be it Horus-Harpokrates the Sun-God born from a lotus-flower, or Kairos replacing Kronos-Chronos as the new Aion, both soon identified with Christ.41 The familiar representation of the Good Shepherd in early Christian art, so it has been asserted, 'ne ddrive pas directement d'Hermes criophore, mais du jeune dieu solaire criophore probablement congu en Orient' 42-i.e. the Hermes-Helios-Kosmokrator of Syria and of the magic hymns, the sun-god and god-son of the triad of Helio- polis; and it can be added-although I would not overrate the importance of this coincidence-that the symbol of this Syrian solar Hermes is the same six-rayed or eight-rayed asterisk (cf. P1. Ih-i)43 which very soon became the amulet (see above, p. 4) and still less in connexion with the radiate (solar?) figure of the Chiflet intaglio. C. F. H. Bruchmann, Epitheta deorum quae apud poetas Graecos leguntur (Leipzig, 1893 - Suppl. to Roscher's Lexikon der Mythologie) lists on p. Ii not less than eleven epithets of Hermes starting with X, and chelyklonos (resounding with tortoise-shell) might look tempting for our amulet; but neither this nor any of the other epithets, except perhaps chlamydephoros (wearing the chlamys), would fit the figure on the Chiflet stone. 38 Cf. also L.

As an adequate representation of the new Saviour-god he would have suggested the figure of Hermes, which then was cut by a competent gem engraver after familiar classical patterns. If the accompanying inscrip- tion did not go beyond the initials that would merely have been an advisable precaution at that time and the accusation of 'un-Roman activities' was thus forestalled by the alibi of the Th(eos) Ch(thonios). Aristocratic and wealthy Roman ladies dabbling in exotic theosophy were apparently not rare in imperial Rome. In his Jewish Antiquities, xviii, 3-the same chapter which contains the much discussed Testamentum Flavianum on Christ-Flavius Josephus narrates two significant incidents: how Egyptian priests of the Isis-sanctuary in Rome procured the virtuous and wealthy Paulina for her hitherto unsuccessful suitor by faking a Hieros Gamos with the Egyptian God Anubis, and how a consortium of four Jewish impostors, one of whom posed as teacher of the mysteries of Jewish religion, fleeced the noblewoman Fulvia-a fraud which induced the emperor Tiberius to banish all Jews from Rome. Since, according to Josephus, the name of the husband of Paulina as well as of Fulvia was Saturninus, it has been suggested45 that both were in fact the same woman, to be identified with a lady whose full name in all its aristo- cratic splendour is known from a Roman inscription to have been BAEBIA, L(ucii), F(ilia), FULVIA CLAUDIA PAULINA GRATTIA MAXI- MILLA.46 No doubt there was more than one BAEBIA (or VIBIA??) PAULINA at that time, but the Jewish-syncretistic character of the cameo in Berne would go well with the mystic inclinations of the heroine of the scandalous affair in the Isis sanctuary in Rome, and of the Roman lady associating with undesirable Jewish elements.47 44 The parallelism Hermes-Christ-Mithras is enhanced by the fact, that this sign also occurs on Mithraic monuments (cf. W. Bins- feld, 'Neue Mithraskultgefaisse aus K61n', Kilner Jahrbuch fir Vor- und Friihgeschichte, v, I96o/6I, p. 7 I, n. 17), most strikingly and exactly in the same shape as we find it on innumerable Early Christian monuments, on a recently found Mithraic cult vessel (Binsfeld, 1.c., p. 7o, fig. 4 and pl. 16). For new aspects on the relation Christ-Mithras cf. J. Duchesne-Guillemin in Zeitschr. d. deutsch. morgenldnd. Gesellsch., cxi, 1961, p. 469 ff. 45 S. Rogers in American Journal of Philology, lii, 1932, p. 252 ff. 46 CIL, vi, 1361--the lower part of a magni- ficent tombstone erected by [B]aebia Fulvia Paulina ... for her distinguished brother and herself; that looks as if she was at her later age separated from her husband? 47 The two incidents are dated (cf. also E. M. Smallwood, 'Some notes on the Jews under Tiberius', Latomus, xv, 1956, p. 314 ff.) by Tacitus A.D. 19, by Josephus (and the latter one implicitly by Philo) C. A.D. 30; but possibly the first one occurred at the earlier, the second one at the later date and the disparateness in dating might be due to the fact that both writers found it convenient to deal with these two related subjects simul- taneously. 2</page><page sequence="12">I0 A. A. BARB II. A JUDAEO-CHRISTIAN AMULET When studying the collection of amuletic gems in the British Museum48 I was shown by the Department of British and Mediaeval Antiquities the metal object reproduced here, P1. 2a-b.49 Obviously a Byzantine amulet, it showed some unusual features which reminded me of an amulet I had read about in the late E. Peterson's Heis Theos,5o that early work by a great scholar which still remains an almost inexhaustible mine of information. Looking up Peterson's description (it was of an electrotype in the Hermitage after a lost original) I found it corresponded exactly with the British Museum amulet except for the second half of the Greek inscription on the reverse.51 But this apparent difference was due to an error, as comparison with the Russian original publications showed.52 So this was after all the same amulet. How- ever, the hope that here in the British Museum was the lost original was soon disappointed. A careful examination left no doubt that this too was a galvano- plastic copy. Still, it is most gratifying to be now in a position to study and publish anew this important amulet from an excellent electrotype, whether this be another copy or the same one which was last examined by Russian scholars in I900-190I53 and has not so far been adequately reproduced. The question which of the two sides of the amulet might be called obverse and which reverse is hard to answer. Thus it seems preferable-following the inscriptions and images-to call one side Christian and the other Gnostic.54 48 Cf. Annual Report of the Warburg Institute, 1952/53, P. 10. 49The object, Reg. no. 1938, Io-io, I, measures 2"3" X I'75" and is o.I" thick. It was acquired shortly before the Second World War from Mme Wolkoff-Mouromtzoff in London. My attempts to get in touch with her for further information about its proven- ance were unsuccessful. I am most grateful to the Trustees of the British Museum for permitting publication. 50 Erik Peterson, Eis eEos - Epigraphische, formgeschichtliche und religionsgeschichtliche Unter- suchungen, G6ttingen, 1926. 51 Peterson, op. cit., p. 121 ff. 52 The amulet was first published (from an exclusively art-historical point of view and without discussing the inscriptions) by D. V. Ainalow, Ellinistickeskie osnovy vizantiiskogo iskusstva, St. Petersburg, I900, p. 192 ff.; cf. now the English revised edition, The Hellenistic Origins of Byzantine Art, ed. by C. Mango, New Brunswick, I96I, p. 250 ff. It was re- published by E. M. Pridik in Zhurnal Minist. Narodn. Prosveshchznia, cccxxxvi, 1900, p. 91 ff. with more details and some criticisms of Ainalow, to which the latter replied ibid., cccxxxviii, p. 133 ff. Peterson had inad- vertently jumped from the first half of the Greek inscription (p. 95 of Pridik's paper) to another inscription (ibid., p. 96-on a wed- ding-ring in the Hermitage, quoted by Pridik as a parallel). The illustration p. 251, fig. I15 of the English edition reproduces the illustra- tion from Pridik's paper which, however un- satisfactory, is still better than the one given originally by Ainalow. 53 It seems possible that the electrotype in the Hermitage was lost during the upheavals of the Russian revolution, or even officially discarded as not being an original. The other possibility is that the owner of the original had more than one galvanoplastic copy made. I wonder whether the copper amulet ('aus massivem Kupfer hergestellt') published by J. Keil in Jahreshefte des isterr. archdol. Instituts, xxxv, 1946, p. 135 ff., which quite obviously reproduces a gnostic intaglio is not also an electrotype and might not come from the same Russian workshop (and collection?) as our amulet. Actually C. Bonner found (American Journal of Archaeology, liii, 1949, p. 270 ff.) that this amulet, a plaster cast of which was 1856 in the Museum of the Uni- versity of Dorpat, was a duplicate from the collection of H. K. E. K6hler in St. Peters- burg and that the original was said to have been brought from South Russia by Count Sheremetyev. 54 So already Pridik, 1.c. (Peterson, l.c.,</page><page sequence="13">THREE ELUSIVE AMULETS II The Christian side shows four horizontal rows of figures divided by three lines of inscriptions; a further inscription runs along the rim, surrounding the whole. These Greek inscriptions offer no difficulties and read (with emenda- tion of the few orthographic mistakes and omitted letters:55 KIptlE I 860arS io)xv Tro!S XepoTi you 6Ti OQKiTEl E IP 8E?laou vTra TOTE : ('O Lord, give not strength to my enemies as thy right hand protects me everywhere') and along the rim -beginning and end separated by a cross-KaQKa Eig -rT&amp;x EKEiVCOV O-TPiYOV KEq)CxxaX, KuptE 6 0E' S IPcOv, lPTl 860CS a0croTi 8ivcatv ('Turn evil unto the heads of those there, O Lord our God, do not give them power'). These invocations, in the language and style of the Septuagint,56 could just as well be Jewish as Chris- tian, but the latter element is added abundantly by the figures. The top row is occupied by the bust of Christ, with cross-shaped halo57 in an oval carried (to heaven? abbreviated representation of the Assumption?) by four flying angels with an eight-rayed star on either side above them. The second row shows first a pastoral group: two shepherds, one resting on a staff and raising his hand towards a large star, the other facing him with pedum shouldered, while behind them-underneath the star-are two animals.58 Then follows the Adoration of the Magi. Led by a similar star, and preceded by a winged angel with halo and sceptre, they are bringing their gifts to the child who, held by his enthroned mother, stretches his hands towards them (mother and child with halo). In the third row we see, in the centre, Christ standing in frontal view, with halo, sceptre and raised right hand, between two kneeling women. She on the left, touching the hem of His garment, must obviously be the woman healed of the issue of blood.59 She on the right might be the Canaanite woman interceding for her daughter.60 Behind her we have Zacchaeus in the tree-top,61 the man healed of the palsy carrying his bed,62 and another man clearly characterized by the spots on his naked body as a leper."6 Left from the centre group we see a man (naked and with his hands takes the side with Christian scenes as obverse and the gnostic one as reverse). 55 They are quite obvious and need not be enumerated here, especially as they have been listed already by Pridik, 1.c., p. 95. 56 Cf., e.g., 6-r i TIE &amp; L cKEora08 aoTo'S:- Sapientia Salom., v, 16; 6rrroorpEla -ra KKI&lt;a TroI EXOpoi~ ~ou: Psalm 54 (53), 7. 57 The type seems to correspond fairly exactly to the type introduced for Christ on coins of Justinian II, cf. J. D. Breckenridge, The numismatic iconography of Justinian II, New York, 1959, P- 46 and pl. v. Cf. also below, note 69. 58 'Two ewes, one of which is lying down while the other is leaping', Ainalow, op. cit., p. 252. 59 Matth. ix, 20 ff.; Mark v, 25 ff.; Luke viii, 43. Cf. also L. R6au, Iconographie de 1'art chritien, ii/2, p. 380 f. (and iii/3, p. 1314 If.), and my notes in this Journal, XI, 1948, p. 42 ff. For the survival of this icono- graphical type cf. also A. Boeckler, Ikono- graphische Studien zu den Wunderszenen der ottonischen Malerei der Reichenau (Abh. d. Bayer. Akad., phil.-hist. Kl., N.F. 52), Munich, 1961, figs. 10-14 and text p. 9 f. 60 Matth. xv, 22; Mark vii, 26. Thus also Pridik, 1.c.; Ainalow's different suggestions do not seem to make sense. Cf. also L. Reau, op. cit., ii/2, p. 282 f., this Journal as quoted above, p. 42, n. 5, and A. Boeckler, op. cit., figs. 78-82 with p. 33 f. 61 Luke xix, 2-5; L.

Ainalow is ob- viously wrong explaining the figure as 'the demoniac after he has been healed' (op. cit., p. 253): the spots on the body of this figure are clearly indicated and can be compared with the same figure reproduced by A. Boeckler, op. cit., figs. I and 4, cf. also text p. 7 ff.</page><page sequence="14">12 A. A. BARB fettered behind his back?), probably the demoniac raving, while two evil spirits, seen in the air on both sides of him, are just leaving him.64 Behind him-on the extreme left-the blind man washing his eyes in the waters of Siloam65 ('the spring is represented as a brook flowing out of a little hill, a youth stretches out his hand towards it'66). Of the seven episodes represented in this third row five occur also on the famous gold-medallions of Adana67- probably of the sixth century which is also the most likely date for our amulet -where Greek legends added to the figures leave no doubt about the inter- pretation.68 The bottom row represents Christ, again with cross-shaped halo,69 standing in a kind of aedicula70 en face and joining a couple in matrimony, a subject familiar from Byzantine marriage belts (and marriage rings)71 although without the aedicula. On our amulet five amphorae at the left of the marriage scene extend the subject to the Wedding of Cana, and at the right five(?) loaves (or baskets?) and two fishes72 seem to extend the whole group to a symbol of the Eucharist.73 On the other hand two verses in the Epithalamium of Paulinus of Nola74 show that the miracle of Cana served as a symbol of Christian marriage and it seems not unlikely that our amulet was intended as a wedding present. While this 'Christian' side of the amulet is in almost perfect condition, the surface of the 'Gnostic' side is unfortunately damaged in several places. Here too we find (in the lower part) a Greek inscription, which reads (again with some orthographical mistakes and omitted letters which are corrected in the following:75  oiivvos[?]76 Bi-i-ivvoS K'Ta-rTa [TTEiT]E77 TTiV PUU'EPav PKT1KET1 IX)(IV. 64 Mark v, 2 ff.; Luke viii, 26 ff.

Perhaps this cross is reserved for Christ crucified (and risen) and therefore left out in representations of his human life on earth. 70 It might be relevant to note, that today orthodox Jews still celebrate the marriage under a kind of baldachin, cf. Encyclopaedia Judaica, v (Berlin, 1930), col. 573 (s.v. Chuppa) and the illustration in The Jewish Encyclopedia, viii (New York, I906), p. 341. 71 Cf. now E. H.

Although this could make sense (the various meanings of the word Apate are enumerated with his usual admirable erudition by L.

The last word, Alimerbimach, appears to be a vox magica, which however I have not met anywhere else and which I cannot explain. Underneath the inscription we see the Hexagram-later so familiar as the Jewish emblem kat'exochen78- flanked by two lions;79 above each of the two lions the crescent and eight- rayed star, above the Hexagram (rather faint) what seem to be three little circles. In the centre of the upper half stands a naked four-winged figure in frontal view, with halo, lion masks on his knees, holding two scorpions in each hand and treading two crocodiles under his feet-the familiar 'Horus on the crocodiles' of ancient Egyptian magic.80 He is surrounded by a number of for a single Eta. For the use of KaTcrrrWTarE in similar magic prayers parallels can be found in large numbers, obviously with reference to the Septuagint, Psalm 90 (91), 13: KacrrraricraES ?ovtra KalCd Sp&amp;KOVra.

Ehrlich, Die Kultsymbolik im Alten Testament und im nachbiblischen Judentum, 1959, P. 128 ff. (Cf. also M. Grunwald in Grab und Friedhof der Gegenwart, hrsg. von St. Hir- zel, Munich, 1927, PP. 41-44). G. Scholem has shown conclusively (Commentary, viii, New York, 1949, PP. 243-51 ; his paper, originally published in Hebrew in the Annual Ha'arez, Jerusalem, 1948, appeared also in a French translation, cf. Ehrlich, op. cit., p. 128, n. 350) that this 'symbol of Judaism' originates from its use on antique magic amulets where (just as the pentagram) it was interpreted as the powerful 'Seal of Solomon', which is men- tioned also in the Greek legend of our amulet. 79 The two lions, flanking a sacred emblem, are among the most frequent motives in the art of the synagogue, from antiquity (cf., e.g., B. Kanael, Die Kunst der antiken Synagoge, Munich etc., I961, figs. 62, 67, 74; E. R. Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco- Roman period, vii, p. 29 ff.) throughout the Middle ages into our times. 80 Cf. K. C. Seele, 'Horus on the Croco- diles', Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vi, 1947, p. 43 ff. While abundant on reliefs of all sizes the figure of Horus on the Crocodiles is rare on engraved 'gnostic' amulets. One example (cut in grey jasper) was published by E. Drioton in Annales du service des antiquitis, xlv, 1947, p. 83 ff. (no. 13). Here the young god is invoked under the name AKPIMAKPAFETA KYPIE (= 'O Lord Akrimakragetes') to pre- serve the wearer from all reptiles. Drioton's unconvincing attempt to explain Akrimakrageta was rightly censured by C. Bonner (American Journal of Philology, lxxv, 1954, p. 303 if.). But I do not think that it is, as Bonner main- tains, 'a meaningless magical word'. It seems to me that the well-known magical formula Akramachamari was turned here into a Greek- sounding noun (cf. Preisendanz, P.G.M., Pap. iv, 2330 'Eppij~ OeCMv dpxflyrrl; 2289 p&amp;ycov &amp;pXpyir1s 'Eppis; I748 &amp;PXpyirs wTrrCv-ros yvvfrEcoS; v, 402 [and 407] 'EpfiWs M6ycv [and yXcOTTrrs] &amp;pxny-ra; similar vii, 670). Simi- larly Horus on the Crocodiles appears on an elaborate late bronze amulet (we read on the reverse the name Jesus combined with lao) published by W. M. Flinders Petrie, Amulets, London, 1914, no. 135 aa, pls. xxii and xlix with the legend Akrammachamarix, again a name formed from the formula assimilated to the name Abrasax which we read on the other side of the figure. G. Scholem (Jewish Gnosti- cism ..., p. 97 if.) discovered that the formula Akrammachamarei, so frequent in magic papyri and on 'Gnostic' gems, is Aramaic, meaning something like 'uproot the magic spells', and was simply no longer understood in Graeco- Roman times. Thus it could easily have been personified in the same way, as-I think-the name Sisinnios originated (see anon). Inci- dentally we read AKPAMMAXAMAPEI (to- gether with magic characters) also on the Horus-Pantheos intaglio reproduced here P1. 2d. In Coptic magic texts Akrammachamari turns up as a Jewish-Christian divine or an- gelic name, sometimes assimilated to the fami- liar angel-names by an added -el (Akramiel, [Akram]machamariel). Cf.

BARB magic characteres, of the kind we find abundantly on late amulets and in the magic papyri, without being so far able to interpret them.81 There are, how- ever, at the left a crescent and eight-rayed star as symbols of Moon and Sun82 and underneath it (badly damaged) a lion sitting, turned to the right, with a branch(?) in its mouth, a bird(?) behind the lion, and the second character in the line above the Greek inscription (left of the crocodiles) appears to be a monogram of Christ: x- c. On the other side of Horus a bird 82a which could 0 be an ibis is standing, turned to the right, on the magic character in the same row as the lion on the other side. The whole is surrounded by the Uroboros, the serpent devouring its own tail, just as we find it on innumerable 'Gnostic' engraved gems.83 The couple Sisinnos-Bisisinnos-the first usually assimilated to the Christian Saint Sisinn os, while the name of his companion varies,s4 who are invoked here together with Solomon and the four archangels-is familiar from many similar magic formulae. It seems that a no longer understood (Semitic?) vox magica, duplicated85 by popular magic glossolalia, was later interpreted as a pair (later even turning into a kind of threesome) in Jewish magic folklore86 of helpers against the evil (female) demon. Possibly the three unexplained mediaeval Jewish 'angel names' (SaNVI SaNSaNVI SaMaNGaLaPH) as well as the Byzantine couple of apocryphal saints could be traced back through the-equally unexplained-SESENGES BAR- PHARANGES (Sesenges, son of Pharanges ?), most frequent in Greek magic 81 Cf. Th. Hopfner in Pauly-Wissowa, R.E., Suppl. iv, 1183 ff. Most characteristic and frequent are the so-called ring-letters (Ger- man 'Brillenbuchstaben'), as we see them on our amulet, signs with little circles at the end of each line, which survived in Jewish (cf. J. Trachtenberg, loc. cit. above, n. 19-- . 141 f.) and Arabic (cf. H. A. Winkler, Siegel und Charaktere in der muhammedanischen Zauberei, 1930, p. 150 if.) and were in general use in the occult arts of mediaeval Europe. Winkler's suggestion (op. cit., p. 167) that they might be derived from Babylonian cuneiform charac- ters seems to me so far the most likely explana- tion and deserves a systematic investigation. 82 The same symbols of sun and moon also occur on the Byzantine gold medallion of Mersine (A. Grabar in Dumbarton Oaks Papers, vi, 1951, P. 25 ff.) and again above the two lions at the bottom of our amulet. As A. Drioton (Bull. de la Soc. d'archdol. copte, x, 1944, p. 71 ff.) has shown, the couple sun-moon express in hieroglyphic writing 'Eternity'. On the long history of this symbol and its survival into mediaeval art see the studies by W.

These Jewish and Christian elements are here combined with the Egyptian figure of Horus in an attitude familiar from a large group of magic monu- ments, of which we reproduce an example on P1. 2c.91 On some of these magic stelae and on numerous magic intaglios the figure of the juvenile sun- god with his typical fore-lock92 has been fused with-or replaced by-the figure of the age-old Bes-Pantheos in similar attitude, but now with four wings and lion's masks on his knees (see P1. 2d, e),93 two characteristics missing on the usual Horus images but clearly in evidence on our amulet. Now these two (together with other) characteristics of the late Egyptian grotesque and sinister Bes-Pantheos figure appear again in countless mediaeval representations of Satan and one might wonder whether the figure on our amulet does not represent the evil demon, the rvaEpdg of the Greek inscrip- tion underneath it. But I find it more likely-startling as this might appear at first-that this figure is meant to be no other than Christ Himself. Evidence for the fact that the figure of Horus was used in early Christian iconography for our Saviour was assembled years ago by W. Drexler.95 Particularly revealing in this respect is the wall painting in a Christian cata- comb at Alexandria, discovered in 1858 and described by N6routsos-Bey96 87 The late antique magic formula moraccrp artlpaEPPou (SISISRO SISIPHERMOU) on the reverse of two gems published by C.

BARB who saw it in I86o, shortly before its complete destruction soon after 1864. The drawing which he adds to his description (here reprod. P1. 2f)97- obviously influenced by the artistic style of his period-must, of course, be taken partly as a reconstruction: it is unlikely that the state of preservation allowed all the details to be seen clearly and beyond doubt. But he too was struck by the similarity with a Horus relief in the Museum of which he also publishes a drawing.98 The figure of our amulet takes its place iconographi- cally between these two representations.99 It is also interesting to compare the monogram in the right-hand bottom corner of the Alexandrian painting (about which Ndroutsos-Bey does not comment) with the similarly placed Christos-monogram on our amulet. The Greek inscription underneath the wall painting was copied by Neroutsos-Bey as follows: El' ACTIIAA KAI BACIAICKON ETIIBHCH KAI KATATIATHCEIC AEONTA KAI APAKONTA100that is a quotation of Psalm 90 (see above, n. 77) using the same verb KoTrc-Tf-rETiv found on our amulet. The invocation on the latter could thus begin with the monogram: Christ together with Sisinnos-Bisisinnos (whence the plural KarTarrcrrTE-rE), assisted by the archangels and the powerful 'seal of Solomon', is asked to 'tread down' the evil demon. While we have Christ shown in the shape of Horus we might see the 'seal' in the Hexagram between the two lions. There exists an interesting affinity between out amulet and a certain group of amuletic bracelets of the same early Byzantine period.' ' Here, as there, Psalm 90 is quoted in the inscription (verse 13 on the Byzantine wall painting and less literally on the amulet, verse i ff. on the bracelets), here as there we have the astonishing combination of familiar representations from the gospels (Annunciation, Nativity, Baptism, Crucifixion, Resurrection on the bracelets) 91 After op. cit., p. 49. 98 Op. cit., p. 46. It is the same relief repro- duced after Daressy here, P1. 2c, and a com- parison of the two reproductions shows Neroutsos-Bey to be quite competent. Cf. also Cabrol-Leclercq, Dict. d'arch. chrit., i, cols. 1135 ff. with figs. 285/6. (The simi- larity of the figure on our amulet with the Horus-relief reproduced by N6routsos-Bey was noted also by Pridik, 1.c., p. 192, who however failed to notice the connexion with the Christ-representation). My suggestion ('Der Heilige und die Schlangen'-see above, notes 41 and 95-p. 21, n. 145) that the Bes- mask over the Horus-figure was taken over as the head of God the Father in Christian iconography (cf. also Bollettino dei musei civici veneziani, vi, i96I, no. 4, p. 14) is reinforced by the fact that on the Alexandrian wall- painting too God the Father as 'L'ancien des jours' (Neroutsos-Bey, op. cit., p. 48) appeared above Christ-Horus. 99 On the other hand the Alexandrian painting finds its iconographical continuation in another respect in mediaeval representa- tions, as suggested by E. Male and 0. Wulff, cf. Reallexikon zur deutschen Kunstgeschichte, i, p. I 147 f., s.v. 'Aspis'. 1oo Op. cit., p. 48. 101 Cf. J.

On one of these brace- lets (Peterson, no. 7), similar to our amulet, SISINNIAS (!-for Sisinnios? but cf. above, n. 84) is added to the invocation of the 'Lord'. Just so, Sisinnios Sisinnarios is added also rather incoherently to the legend on an amulet of this period, threatening the 'memisemene' (see above, n. 94) with Solomon, on which C. Bonner remarks (Proc. of the Amer. Philos. Soc., lxxxv, 1942, p. 47I, n. 22), 'Sisinnarius may be a brother of Sisinnius, or, perhaps more probably, the word may be a mere jingling repetition of the same Sisinnius with an amplified ending' (referring to parallels). 'Hagie Sisinnie' (O St. Sisinnius) also added on an amulet in Bonner's own collection, see ibidem, fig. 8, after the words 'There is one God who conquers the evil'.</page><page sequence="19">THREE ELUSIVE AMULETS 17 with figures like the Egyptian solar Chnoubis-serpent, 102 so frequent on 'Gnostic' intaglios, the 'Seal of Solomon' and King Solomon himself on horse- back, treading down and transfixing with his lance the female evil demon. The latter image again, extant on numerous late antique haematite-intaglios (usually with the legend sphragis theou [Seal of God] on the reverse) is taken over as the favourite obverse of a well-known class of Byzantine amuletic medallions.103 These medallions as well as the bracelets are engraved in copper or bronze, often showing silver plating (only some of the bracelets are solid silver?), and I think it most likely that the same applies to the lost original of our amulet.104 Against the possibility that the original might have been an engraved gem- stone105 we have the appearance of the workmanship-apparently a burin and not the stone-engraver's drill or rotating little wheel was used-and the spots of damaged surface which correspond more to the damage caused by metal corrosion than to the shell-like splintering off from a gem-stone. III. AMULETUM KIRCHERIANUM A few years ago a London antique dealer, Mr. Ivar Mackay, took a rather unusual kind of amulet which he had recently acquired to the Department of Mediaeval Antiquities at the British Museum for an explanation of it. The 102 Cf. J. Maspero, l.c., fig. I (middle medallion) and fig. 2 with C. Bonner, S.M.A., pls. iv/v, figs. 8i-ioi. I have suggested on another occasion ('Abraxas-Studien' in Hom- mages a W. Deonna, Brussels, 1957, p. 76) that this serpent is meant to represent God himself, finding only later that a similar suggestion had been made by H. Gressmann in Zeitschr. fiir die A.-T. Wissensch., xliii, I925, p. i4; for his derivation of the 'Darstellung des Gottes als Schlange' cf. more recently R. Goossens in La Nouvelle Clio, vi, 1954, p. 5 iff (the Hebrew letter Nun = Serpent = Eternity). I was guided to my conclusion by the attri- bute Gigantorhekta of the Chnoubis-Serpent on 'Gnostic' intaglios. We might see this Hel- lenistic-Jewish motif on a Syrian relief (cf. E. Goodenough, Jewish Symbols [etc.], vii, fig. 214 and p. 191), where the ubiquitous divine horseman (see following note), be it 'Solomon' or some other hypostasis of God himself (for Solomon - God cf., e.g., W. F. Volbach in Amtliche Berichte aus den Kgl. Preussischen Kunstsammlungen, xxxix, 1917/18, col. 124 f.), is actually shown in the role of Gigantorhekta. 103 Of the extensive literature about the Rider-Saint-Amulets I should mention be- sides G. Schlumberger, 1.c. (see above, n. 94) and C. Bonner, S.M.A., p. 208 f. only two more recent papers: H. Menzel in Jahrbuch des Rom.-Germ. Zentralmuseums Aiainz, ii, 1955, p. 252 ff. and A. V. Bank in Vizantiiskii Vremennik, viii, 1956, p. 331 ff. For the icono- graphical derivation of the motif see now E. H. Kantorowicz in Art Bulletin, xxvi, 1944, p. 207 ff. (the legends of figs. 31/33 and 32/34 should be exchanged). 104 We can exclude gold, as all the known gold medallions of this period are not en- graved, but embossed. However, it might be that the lost original was a bronze mould for the fabrication of such gold amulets; that moulds of this kind were used is documented beyond doubt by the two identical gold medallions of Adana, see above, note 67. This hypothesis would explain the rather puzzling fact, that our amulet shows neither perfora- tion nor traces of a loop, by which it could have been suspended. Such a loop would, of course, have been soldered on separately on a gold medallion. 105 There can be no doubt that the original of the copper amulet referred to above, note 53, was an intaglio and we are used to seeing both the Horus-Figure and the surrounding Uroboros on engraved gems. The unusually large size would not be without parallels, cf. the two Early Christian intagli published by H. Wentzel, Miinchner Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, 3. F., viii, 1957, p. 48 ff., no. 3-4. But our electrotype shows two flat faces of equal size, while on a gemstone we would expect one side to be smaller and one convex.</page><page sequence="20">x8 A. A. BARB apparently quite unique object proved to be just as puzzling to the experts there, but they suggested to him that he show it to me. The black tablet measured 5 " X 2-" and was about 1" thick. It looked like ebony or black soapstone, but closer examination revealed the typical cracks of very old, but well preserved, almost petrified leather (see the enlarge- ment, P1. 3c). As regards any further comments I had to confess that I was by no means more knowledgeable than the learned staff of the Museum. But I had a photograph of the amulet taken (here reproduced P1. 3a, b) and promised Mr. Mackay that he would hear from me one day, if I ever came across a similar object. It was the lucky kind of coincidence which so often earns one the quite undeserved reputation of formidable erudition, that a few days later I opened-merely during my routine work as librarian-one of the folios of that curiously baroque polyhistor Athanasius Kircher, S.J. (I6oI- I68o); and here I saw to my amazement Mr. Mackay's amulet106 (here reprod.-after Kircher-P1. 3d). Quite definitely this was the amulet, not just a very similar one. Not only was every single one of the numerous and curious magic characters faithfully reproduced by Kircher's engraver, there was also the same left top corner broken off. However, Kircher's accompany- ing text provided another surprise: according to him it was a bronze tablet, belonging to the collection of antiquities of the famous (and prosperous) lawyer and university professor of Padua, Giovanni Galvani (1593-1665) -lo The Paduan humanist Johannes Rhodius (1587-1659), a distinguished physi- cian, philologist and antiquarian108 had sent this 'tabulam aenam exoticorum characterum varietate intricatissimam' to the learned Jesuit, 'ut si fieri posset, tantae mysteriorum sub iis reconditorum caligini aliquam lucem adferrem'. Now I do not think that Athanasius Kircher was unable to distinguish between pressed leather and bronze and we must accept the fact that the enthusiastic Paduan collector had-consciously or unconsciously-acquired a bronze cast of our leather amulet for his gabinetto.109 That is to say that Mr. Mackay's amulet is the original, as it would have been quite easy to make a bronze cast of it, but practically impossible to reproduce so exact a replica of a bronze amulet in pressed leather. Besides this, the whole fashioning of the amulet reveals that it was planned for leather technique, the deepened reverse being intended to bring out a sharper relief on the obverse when the soft cuir bouilli was pressed between two moulds, while another set of magical characters was obviously added later by hand with a blunt stylus on the now almost hardened surface. 110 106 Athanasius Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus, iii, Rome, 1654, p. 36. 107 About him cf.

First he deals at some length with the fact that Christians of Moorish and Arabian descent,112 not satisfied with holy images as such, think it essential for their efficiency as amulets to 'deform' them (following the impious tradi- tions of the Gnostics) 'occultis quibusdam Cabalistarum Magorumque Schola depromptis characteribus'. This heretical and objectionable usage, familiar to him from numerous crosses, medals and tablets sent to him as an expert from all parts of the world, he sees amply manifested in this amulet. He had, of course, no difficulty in identifying on the obverse the enthroned Christ, the Holy Virgin, St. John the Evangelist, and three angel busts. But here the fact that he knew only a bronze cast and not the original influenced his inter- pretation in a curious way. From the leather original it is clear that the faces of all these five figures, being the most protruding part of the amulet, had been worn off by longish use; as the faces of the two angels in the top corners show, the rubbing away of the hardened top layer had even allowed corrosion of the leather to set in. But the bronze cast with a uniformly even surface showed nothing of the kind and led Kircher to the belief that all the faces were veiled. He explained the veiled face of Christ as signifying its inaccessibility to human intellect,113 and, in mentioning the veiling of the other five faces also, he appears to see mysteries in all of them. The two angels in the top corners he identifies as Gabriel (left) and Michael (right) 'as the letters added at the side of either of them signify', not saying however anything about the third angel. In the signs surrounding the enthroned Christ he recognizes the signs of the seven apocalyptic spirits114 in characters derived 'ex Gymnosophistarum Schola', characters which at the same time correspond to the seven planets. (But there are in fact eight signs and he does not explain the one at the top right.) The four signs in the four corners around the Christ signify, he asserts, the four 'Intelligences' presiding over the four parts of the world. 'By their power-as is [to be found] in S. Irenaeus115-[the Gnostics] believe impiously 111 '... summa quoque indagine ad arcana huius tabulae sacramenta penetranda omnes animi ingeniique vires applicui.' 112 Apparently he is not thinking of Moris- cos in Spain but of the Oriental Christians in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt: he marks this paragraph at the margin as dealing with the Melchitae (who incidentally were reconciled with the Roman Church only after Kircher's death). 113 .. . per faciem velatam, humano intel- lectui inaccessam significabant, per extensam manum benedicentem misericordiam, per absconditam, iustitiam eiusdem, ob poeni- tentiae spem tardantem, innuebant.' 114 He gives their names as Sebtaal, Zeda- kidl, Madamidil, Schemfidl, Nogadil, Cocha- bidl, Levaniel. 115 What Kircher has in mind is obviously Irenaeus, Contra haereses, i, but he quotes, as it seems, from memory and incorrectly. I can- not find there a passage corresponding reason- ably well with Kircher, although Irenaeus mentions various quaterniones (-eTrpdBas), deal- ing with the involved aeonial genealogies of the various gnostic systems. Nearest to Kircher is Cap. XV, 3 (P.G., vii, 619). Kircher gives the names of these four mundi partium intelligentiae praesides as 'Mahaziel, Azael, Saviel, Azazel'. Actually the last one of these is mentioned by Irenaeus (Cap. XV, 6 - P.G., vii, 628), but in a completely dif- ferent context, as an evil angel (cf. also the commentary, P.G., vii, 1474). Cornelius Agrippa, De occulta philosophia, ii, Cap. 7, lists these four names (two of them slightly dif- ferently spelled) as the 'quatuor principes daemo- niorum nocentes in elementis'. About the role of the four parts of the world in late antique esoteric speculations cf. my remarks in</page><page sequence="24">20 A. A. BARB that Christ, the Word of God, finds entrance (influxus) into the mystical world of his Church'. This mystical Church he sees aptly represented by the veiled figures of the Virgin and St. John the Evangelist and by the cross [the one in relief?] with two crescents. Here he refers to the Cabbalistic 'archetype Malcuth' [= the Kingdom] which he equals with the 'Luna supercoelestis'. The two signs in relief flanking this cross he reads as the wel -known symbolic Greek letters Alpha and Omega and finds in the [engraved] cross an expression of the idea that this ',nfluxus' of the 'Word' or 'Malcuth' took place through the cross and passion of our Lord. This, he sums up, is the explanation of the obverse of the tablet where 'holy images are mixed with Cabbalistic, Greek, Hebraic, and Arabic characters of Spirits' to make the holy images more powerful, a superstitious custom still prevailing in his days, as he knows, with many Christians in the Orient.116 Having thus, it seems, exhausted all his spiritual and intellectual powers11 he sits back, as it were, and declares that the reverse of the amulet, which is 'disfigured' with magic signs, would better never have seen the light and is no further concern of his here, especially as it does not contain anything Egyptian.118 So far the learned Father Kircher. Now the 'veiled faces' by which his mystical interpretation was obviously guided are, as I have shown, due to a misunderstanding. As regards Kircher's interpretation of the characteres I find it difficult to comment. No doubt the learned polyhistor knew far more about mediaeval Oriental occultism than I do, and he may be right in some of his assertions. I do not know from what alphabet he reads the names of the angels Gabriel and Michael. I have doubts about his reading of Alpha and Omega: these two signs resembling roughly an A and a W or M and turned into a quite irregular angle occur again among the many queer relief signs with which the reverse is 'disfigured'. (But see below, n. 128.) The signs of the Intelligentiae or planetary spirits are not known to me in this form, but it is just possible that he found them in some Hebrew, Arabic or Syriac manuscript.119 The signs we find in Cornelius Agrippa's (1486-1535) Occult Philosophy120 are different, although equally strange looking; however we know that they are not nonsensical inventions but (as so much in the more authentic sources of Cabbala, magic, and astrology) the results of serious and strenuous, if misguided and often mentally abnormal speculation, as has been shown not long ago in this Journal.121 The nonsense into which all that was turned by dilettanti, quacks, and impostors 'Abraxas-Studien', l.c.

A.D. 850), published and translated by J. Hammer [-Purgstall], London, I8o6. This work was known and used by A. Kircher (together with other similar esoteric writings), although in a manuscript different from that discovered by Hammer (cf. his introduction, p. xvii ff.). For still older systems cf. J. Doresse, 'Crypto- graphie copte et cryptographie grecque', Bulletin de l'Institut d'Igypte, xxxiii, 1952, p. 215 ff- 120 De Occulta Philosophia, ii, Cap. 22. 121 Vol. xii, 1949, P- 46 ff. and 196 ff.</page><page sequence="25">THREE ELUSIVE AMULETS 21 is another story. Thus I feel reluctant to subscribe wholeheartedly to what would probably be put forward as the most likely suggestion, namely that all these abstruse characters on our amulet have no meaning at all and were just invented ad hoc to give the amulet a mysterious look. There are clearly two different 'alphabets'-if this expression is adequate-on the reverse, one in relief impressed from the mould and one inscribed round the margin with a stylus. The messy conglomeration of the relief letters-apparently without distinct lines-looks admittedly suspicious; but we would think the same, for instance, of the two tables which Jacques Gaffarel (I6oI-8 1-incidentally an exact contemporary of Athanasius Kircher) added to his queer book122 (P1. 4c), if we did not have his explanation that this is a 'Configuration des etoiles en characteres c6lestes' and his obligingly added key to the Celestial Hebrew Alphabet.123 I wonder how many would be inclined to dismiss it as nonsense if they were shown a sample from the lead books of Granada (here P1. 4d), that much discussed pious Spanish (or Morisco) fake of the late sixteenth century.124 But if some explanatory hint is forthcoming-as it obviously was in this case-you can read on this sample the Latin words 'Liber Funda/menti Eclesiae/, Salomonis Cha/racteribus/Scriptus'. If this is comparatively easy, I for one would be completely out of my depth if confronted with similar cryptic writing, say in Arabic.125 It therefore seems not impossible that some time an expert might be able to decipher at least part of these inscriptions. I must however refrain from such an attempt, just as Kircher did, but with a frank ignoramus and sine ira et studio. There still remains the question when and where this amulet originated. A clue seems to me to be found in the characteristic architectonic shape both on obverse and reverse, that horseshoe-shaped and slightly pointed arch set over a square, resembling somehow the prayer niche or Mihrab of Islamic architecture.126 Rather striking however is the similarity with certain orna- mental stone slabs with Cufic or Arabic inscriptions of which I reproduce two examples from Spain here (P1. 4a and b).127 We have seen that Kircher with his extensive knowledge of such things decided that our amulet is a creation of Christian and Arabian contacts.128 Could it not be that he was fundamentally right but erred in looking towards the Orient and not towards 122 Curiositez inouyes, sur la sculpture talis- manique des Persans, Horoscope des Patriarches et lecture des Estoilles, Paris, 1629. 123 This as well as other similar occult alphabets are reproduced in Cornelius Agrip- pa's De occulta philosophia, iii, cap. 30o. 124 T.

Gallichan, Cordova, a city of the Moors, London, 1907, pls. 56-59, I21, 126. 128 The 'Alpha and Omega' on our amulet could also be interpreted from Islamic magi- cal characters (cf. H. A. Winkler, Siegel und Charaktere . . . [see above, n. 81], p. 145 ff.) and the general type of our amulet-a square tablet perforated for suspension-has the closest parallels I can find in the Arabic pro- tection tablets in Cairo, reproduced by Rudolf and H. Kriss, Volksglaube im Bereich des Islam, ii, Wiesbaden, 1962, figs. 20-22.</page><page sequence="26">22 A. A. BARB Spain with her population of christianized Moors? If we take this clue we might go even further and point to a place both reclaimed from Islamic to Christian denomination and famous for its mastery in the art of leather- working-I mean Cordova. Her unsurpassed leather products, which en- riched the English (and French) language with words for shoemaker- cordwainer (cordonnier)129-were famous throughout the Middle Ages.130 This would seem to me the most likely place where an object of this quality, surviv- ing the centuries, might have been fabricated. In which century should we now date the amulet? We have, of course, the indisputable terminus ante quem of the appearance of the bronze cast in the Paduan collection, say about 1630; the leather amulet had already been con- sidered, probably for quite a long time, as an object of great antiquity worth having a bronze cast made from it. But this terminus ante quem does not mean much for us, as from an art-historical point of view the figures of the obverse show clearly the style of the twelfth century A.D. If we accept the attribution to Cordova-and I am well aware that this is just a hypothesis-we would have to take the year 1236 A.D. as terminus post quem, viz. the year in which Cordova changed after five centuries from Islamic back to Christian rule and religion. As in so many cases of popular and industrial art, especially when existing moulds were in use, a twelfth-century artistic style might well be possible for an object fabricated, say, about the middle of the thirteenth century. About this time then and for Cordova I would tentatively fix the origin of Mr. Mackay's Christian leather amulet. But, I repeat, tentatively. 129 Cf. Oxford English Dictionary, s.vv. Cor- dovan, Cordwain, Cordwainer; W. v. Wart- burg, Franzdsisches Etymologisches Worterbuch, ii, 1946, p. I 182, s.v. Corduba. 130 Its renown can be traced back into Carolingian times (see the references quoted by Du Cange, Glossarium mediae et infimae latini- tatis, s.v. Cordebisus, Cordenisae pelles, etc.).
