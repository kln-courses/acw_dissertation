Why only this and not that? If amaryllises produce only amaryllises and boa constrictors engender only boa constrictors, why does our human spirit produce such a variety of flowers and forms when taking as its springboard the world and itself? The question "Who are we?" should be replaced by "Why are we exactly like this?" Psychology, sociology, biochemistry, electronic micro- scopes, and radioactivity can never provide the answer to this question. Only art can pry the secret of man's innermost core. Somly6's ars poetica stems from his belief that the word turns into his hands and feet, or perhaps that the poet be- comes the very feet and hands of mankind. Indeed, he encompasses life's and art's incredible wealth by his poetic word. We travel to Italy with the poet and see the landscapes and paintings, or a simple hotel room, with his discerning and speculative eye. We get a vision of the archetypal form of Bart6k's music that no human ear could possibly hear. With his magnificent Cantata Tremenda, based on the horrible rape in the Book of Judges 19-21, we are jolted back and forth from biblical times to the present, understanding what hap- pens to a nation if there is no law and order and everyone acts as he pleases. In the cycles "The Wound and the Knife" and "Extracts" dream and reality play hide-and-seek with us. The poet gains his inspiration not only from world literature, but also from paintings, sculptures, music, television series, philosophy, anthropology, mathematics, professional se- crets, the heart attack of a fellow poet, a peace congress, or the statement of the secretary of the Chinese Writers Union that ten thousand poets were killed during the Cultural Revolution. The cycle "Ten Thousand Ways of Being a Cat" convinces us that nothing can ever be considered finite or completed and that if we really want to grasp the very being of a cat, we must discard our anthropomorphic notions and find the cat in ourselves. Somly6's poems give us an inkling of the inexhaustible possibilities of life, the wealth of reality, and our relationship to them through the sensitivity of a true poet who is capable of pouring the formless, ever-changing infinite into the per- fect mold of finite forms. It has been said that translating poetry is performing a dance in fetters. This is particularly true when translating earthy Hungarian, which is naturally full of concrete images, into analytical French. The team of outstanding translators - including Paul Chaulot, Michel Deguy, and Guillevic, to name but three - have met the challenge; even in fetters they are dancing.
