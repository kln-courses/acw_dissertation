(Grades K-4) Picture-Perfect Science Lessons: Using Children's Books to Guide Inquiry By Karen Rohrich Ansberry and Emily Morgan 300 pp. $28.95. ISBN 0873552431. 2005. NSTA Press. (Grades K-8) This collection of teachers' favorite picture books, followed in each case by hands-on, inquiry activities based on each story, offers valuable ways to integrate reading and sci- ence while providing the opportu- nity to address issues surrounding anthropomorphism in some of the selected trade books. The 15 lessons included are de- signed for children in grades three through six, although some lessons could be adapted for younger or older children. Chapters 3 and 4 in the book explain how the lessons use the 5E Instructional Model devel- oped by the Biological Science Cur- riculum Study. Each of the lessons contains reproducible handouts for children, explanations for teachers, extension activities, and a variety of To browse the more than 1,400 reviews in the NSTA Recommends searchable database, and purchase these or other teaching resources. . .Visit recommends www.nsta.org/recommends November/December 2005 59</page><page sequence="2">recommends • assessments. There are also bibli- ographies for further reading on the topic. Activities to help in reading comprehension are marked with a special icon throughout the book. Chapter 5 in the book includes the National Science Education Standards for grades K-8, with a data table that show where each lesson in the book would fall. All the activities in this book have the Standards related to that particular lesson highlighted in green at the beginning of the lesson. Suggested guiding questions are included in each lesson, and a section at the end contains suggestions for de- veloping open inquiry. The book also includes ways for the teacher to develop reading comprehension while still keeping the spotlight on science activities. The lessons are not meant to be a full curriculum for science but are designed for use where appropriate in the formal science curriculum. They would also be useful in connecting pleasure reading with science activities and reinforcing the idea that science is not an isolated body of knowledge but has many connections to other disciplines. However, the anthro- pomorphism evident in such sto- rybooks as Sheep in a Jeep requires that the teacher recognize the pos- sibility of creating misconceptions in young children. A teacher must also have a solid understanding of the difference between Larmarckian explana- tions for evolution and Darwin's model. On page 136 of the book in the activities on symbiosis, there are statements such as "Guide the students to the idea that species acquire their unique characteristics through a gradual process that takes many generations. Explain that, when an organism's environment changes, that organism must adapt to survive. Adaptations occur in the structures of an organism or in the way it behaves within the environ- ment." Statements like these often lead to the Lamarckian misconcep- tion that acquired characteristics are passed on to offspring, rather than the understanding that the best adapted organisms survive to pass their characteristics on to future generations.
