<plain_text><page sequence="1">DECADENCE Helmut WERNER : Der Untergang Roms. (Forschungen zur Kirchen- und Geistesgeschichte, Bd. xvii.) Pp. viii +217. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, i939. THIS is a study of the views expressed in ancient literature on the subject of 'Dekadenz', on the change for the worse, the falling away from 'the nor- mal state of affairs'. It covers both Greece and Rome, since Roman histori- cal writing and the interpretation of Roman history were both moulded by Greek theories. The interest of the work lies in the fact that it is written by one who starts with a Weltanschauung and seeks to apply German racial theories to ancient history, to find the key to the 'Untergang-Problem' in racial purity, the destruction of raciallyvaluable elements, and the mixture of races. 'The problem of the downfall of States or civilizations is set afresh for every new Weltanschauung.' To illustrate Dr. Werner's approach to the problem: great play is made with the words 'dynamic' and 'static', the former being characteristic of the Nor- dic nature, the latter of the Mediter- ranean. Thus Hesiod's pessimism with its 'Dynamik' is Nordic, while 'the static-vegetative feeling' (which has</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 85 inspired the picture of the Islands of the Blest) traceable in his work derives from the Mediterranean world-the fact that his father came from Asia Minor implies connexion with Mediterranean culture. While Hesiod has not that reverence for woman which is usual with Indo-Ger- manic peoples, yet in his objection to splitting up the family property we may perhaps see the thought of the Siffpe and a reflection of the indivisible in- heritance of Nordic law. Hesiod's 'im- manent conception of God and justice' would suggest that his essential char- acter was Indo-Germanic. Is the Greek anthropomorphic repre- sentation of the gods due to the indivi- dualistic influences of the Mediter- ranean culture? If Persia appeared to the Greeks of the fifth century as an essentially oriental power, how far had in fact the original Nordic spirit capitulated to the Orient? It is ad- mitted that we cannot tell. In the Hellenistic period Polybius' discussion of Tyche illustrates the victory of the irrational over the rational anthropo- centric view of history-the repres- sion of the Indo-Germanic element--but his intimate relations with the leaders of a foreign people of like blood show that he was a representative of genuine Hellenic 'Volkstum'. Thucydides had not merely Nordic barbarian blood in his veins but he is the embodiment of the Nordic character: by introducing into his historical account of the rela- tions of peoples the conception of Power be opened the way to the dynamic element in all later historiography. Yet, despite his brave new Weltan- schauung, Dr. Werner makes some re- markable admissions. The feeling of decadence in the early Greek aristo- cracies did not spring from a single definite cause, and one must not pre- maturely construe ' v6lkisch ' differences as the ground of that decadence. If the thought of Heraclitus combines both static and dynamic elements, it is no satisfying explanation simply to point generally to foreign influences. It is interesting to note that it was through over-straining the 'Fiihrerprinzip' that tyrannies and the 'Demagogentum' of democracy both became forms of deca- dence. The alternative-Kultur or Race -cannot do justice to a complicated phenomenon like the fall of Rome: it does but veil what it promises to ex- plain. The downfall of Rome is no simple problem to which the theory of Race provides the key, and in the case of Greece we have to confess that up to the present the derivation of philo- sophical ideas of history from the source of a racially conditioned Weltanschauung must remain undecided since the racial composition of 'Hellenentum 'is still un- certain. In that composition the Dina- ric race plays a prominent part, and that means relations with Asia and a gift for creative form which predesti- nates the Dinaric Greek for the produc- tion of ideas. Only a study of Plato from this point of view will carry us further: Indeed, it is precisely the clash of elements which are in some degree dif- ferent which turns happenings into history and then produces views which give a meaning to the history. This conclusion, however, must not be taken as an argument against theories of the significance of racial purity. Dr. Werner's last word is: 'What conception of deca- dence a man has depends upon the kind of man he is, and his manhood is essen- tially determined by Race, " Volkstum ", and the particular historical situation.' The reader would seem to be left with Dr. Werner at loggerheads with a Weltanschauung-or is the whole book in fact a veiled attack upon theories of racial purity? N. H. BAYNES.
