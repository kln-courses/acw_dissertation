<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of English and Germanic Philology ? 1985 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois CHAUCER'S MAN OF LAW AND THE CONSTANCY OF JUSTICE Joseph E. Grennen, Fordham University We might well suppose that a tale chosen and adapted by Chaucer for narration by a lawyer would be meant to reveal something of the spe cial facets of perception enjoyed by a legally trained mind; it is odd, therefore, that the Man of Law's tale of Constance has not often been approached from that point of view. It is curious, too, that the tren chant irony involved?feminine hagiography issuing from the lips of a representative of an institution largely responsible for the mainte nance of woman's subordinate position in society?rarely provokes comment. By addressing these issues in the light of certain particular habits of medieval legal thought and terminology, I hope to be able to put in clearer focus the basis for Chaucer's election and imaginative shaping of this tale, a tale presented as a lawyer's account of the suffer ings of a woman who is the very embodiment of the virtue of con stantia, a virtue she is given innumerable opportunities to demon strate precisely because of the failure of human legal structures to protect her. It is probably impossible to reflect upon The Man of Law's Tale with out yielding to speculations about Chaucer's own training in the law? an old tradition, but one without any really solid evidence behind it? or to guesses about the sort of familiarity he may have had with aca demic treatises on legal theory, even if he had never undergone any rigorous training in pleading, the preparation of writs, and the other technical accomplishments of a practicing lawyer. The record of his own participation in legal actions as defendant and plaintiff is itself extensive enough to suggest that he could have garnered a consider able familiarity with legal principles and terminology, as well as the whole instrumentation of courts, juries, judges, and advocates merely from direct observation. In any case, there is no need to wait for positive external evidence of Chaucer's legal acquirements, since the poetry is itself the best proof of the range of his knowledge of the law. The Man of Law's Tale can readily be seen to be extensively concerned with legal particularities; what is less obvious, but far more significant, is the degree to which it is involved with the question of the orienta tion toward the world induced in more theoretically minded jurists by 498</page><page sequence="2">Chaucer's Man of Law, Constancy of Justice 499 the habit of contemplating the law as a construct of beauty, order, and majesty. The difficulty in recognizing the considerable number of legal terms used in the tale (as well as in other poems of Chaucer's) is the same difficulty encountered in recognizing other technical vocabu laries or jargons; much of it has passed, through linguistic extension, into the common language. One would not ordinarily suppose that such words as "difficultee," "enquere," "excuse," and even "pleyn," were elements in a technically precise legal vocabulary, although there are other terms used by Chaucer, such as "collusioun," "ordynaunce," and "extorcioun," which are instantly recognizable as terms of law because that is the sense in which they have survived.1 The serious application of legal language, of course, is a different matter from the self-conscious exchange of jargon indulged in by the lawyer and the Host in the headlink to the tale. That is no more than we expect from Harry and his dupe of the moment, as he stage-manages the telling of the next tale. He parades his little store of professional lingo, speak ing about "forwards," and "juggements," and "acquytyng," while the lawyer obligingly retorts in kind with sententious ponderosities like "Biheste is dette," and "swich lawe as a man yeveth another wight, / He sholde hymselven usen it, by right,"2 both of which are standard legal principles enunciated in the Digest of Justinian, the bible of the legal profession on the Continent at least, throughout the thirteenth 1A helpful guide to late medieval Latin legal terminology is the dictionary (or vocabu lary) of Alberic de Rosciate (d. 1354): Albericus de Rosciate, Dictionarium (Lugduni, 1548). Even as simple a phrase as "to speke al playn" (1. 219), for example, may owe something to the legal notion of judicial action de piano (Dictionarium, s.v. De piano): De plano aliquid dicitur fieri quod iudex sine figura et strepitu iudiciario facit. . . . Dicitur ergo iudex aliquid facer? de plano quando scilicet residens in loco in quo iudicare consueuit, et aliqualiter instructus, sine iuris sollenitate ali quid facit, statuit aut d?termin?t. (A thing is said to be done de piano which the judge does judicially without form and fanfare. ... A judge is therefore said to take action de plano, namely, when occupying the place in which he usually renders judgments, and informed in some way or other, he acts without legal solemnity, and makes a settlement or determination.) 2 The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, ed.

Robinson (p. 690) calls the phrase "Bihest is dette" proverbial. But see Alberic (Dictionarium, s.v. condictio): "Certi condic tio competit ex omni obligatione." Cf. Justinianus, Digesta, ed. T. Mommsen (Berlin, 1870), 1, 358: ". . . licet enim nobis ex omni contractu cerium condicere, dummodo praesens sit obligatio."

To the supposition that a narrative embroidered on the surface with so much legalism is likely, if examined in detail, to show itself more profoundly concerned with a theoretical view of law, it might be ob jected that the legal flavor, the central incident of the trial as well as the entire battery of legal and quasi-legal terminology?phrases such as "short and pleyn," "as in this cas," "priv?e conseil," and numerous others of like tonality?are merely an aspect of "characterization." After all, how else would a lawyer speak? But considerations of this sort lead inevitably to the question of when a linguistic idiosyncrasy is not simply a mannerism but rather the vehicle of a special way of looking at reality. Chaucer may not have had the benefit of gestalt psy chology, but he certainly knew something about the influence of habit, including rhetorical habit, on the human personality. The pilgrim narrator of the General Prologue observes of the Sergeant of the Law (as he is there identified) not only that "he semed bisier than he was," but that he was a virtual library of case law: In termes hadde he caas and doomes alle That from the tyme of King William were falle. (CT, 11. 323?24) Whether the phrase "caas and doomes" is used in a general sense, or is meant as an allusion to a collection of briefs known by the title of Casus etjudicia, a collection compiled by abstracting cases on the plea rolls of the King's Courts, the emphasis intended is on the lawyer's mastery of applied legal knowledge.4 And although he is commended for his "science" and for being "war and wys," there is not the slightest suggestion that he is a legist of the stamp of Irnerius, or Baldus, or Accursius,5 those Continental theoreticians skilled in Roman law: it is 3 See H.

The editor ob serves that what the author did "was to brief, in excellent form, cases from the rolls and to present, within the smallest possible compass, the bare facts of the cases, the judge ment or ruling, and the citation to his source" (p. xxvii). 5 The work of the Italian legists was appreciated in England at an early date. Singleton points out that Francesco d'Accorso (1225-83), mentioned by Dante (Inferno, XV, 110), son of the famous Accursius (Accorso da Bagnolo), was, in 1273, invited by Edward I to come to England, an invitation he accepted, lecturing for a time at Oxford.</page><page sequence="4">Chaucer's Man of Law, Constancy of Justice 501 English common law and case law that he is practiced in. Like that of the Doctour of Physik (in fact, like most of the pilgrim-portraits) the description abounds in ambiguities. His words are wise, he knows the statutes, but he has conveniently reduced all questions to the principle of "fee simple," a rather obvious pun, with an intimation of venality on the lawyer's part.6 Despite the perfunctory honorifics, it is a far from flattering portrait. The tale of Constance, on the other hand, seems to flow from a sensibility of much larger reach. It is hard to believe that it is meant to reflect badly on the lawyer, in the way that the Reeve's Tale may be said to reinforce his nastiness, or the Clerk's Tale his addiction to the short and quick precisions of syllogism. Although the tales are in most cases superbly suited to their tellers, it is sometimes to a teller conceived in a way which differs sharply from the attitude underlying the portrait. In the General Prologue, the Sergeant of the Lawe is near cousin to the venal pomposities of Roman comedy, or the self-important magis trates of Fielding and Dickens. The tale, on the other hand, quite clearly reveals its narrator to be a devotee of justice in some ideal order, rather than a legal technician grown wealthy through sharp practices. And even if we take the hyperbole and gaudy rhetoric of his apostrophes as an insinuation of vocational windiness, the sentiments he espouses are unexceptionable. Analysis of the fundamental meaning of the tale, indeed, might well begin with one of the more curious of these apostrophes?one which occurs early in the tale, and punctuates Constance's expressed realiza tion that her father's decision to wed her to the Sultan of Syria shows that Wommen are born to thraldom and penance, And to been under mannes governance. (11. 286?87) This reflection is followed by the narrator's comparison of the weep ing over her departure to the lamentations attending the sacking of See Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy, trans, with a Commentary by Charles S. Singleton, 3 vols., Bollingen Series lxxx (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1970), 1, Inferno, Part 2; Commentary, p. 271. 6 Complaints against the avarice and duplicity of lawyers were, of course, widespread and frequently savage. Wyclif, who reserves his worst attacks for the friars, believes that lawyers (he may be thinking primarily of canonists) are almost as bad, because they "pro parvo lucro suo d?clinant a iusticia et placitant pro iniusticia Antichristi, et sic exhere dant multos, spoliant ipsos de suis beneficiis et bonis mobilibus ducentes ad carcerem." ("For their little fee fall away from justice and act as appeasers for the injustice of Anti christ, and thus disinherit many men, rob them of their benefices and their belongings, forcing them into prison.*') See Johannis Wyclif Opus Evangelicum, ed. Iohann Loserth, 4 vols, [in 2], Wyclif Society Publications (London: Tr?bner, 1895?96), in, 72.</page><page sequence="5">502 Grennen Troy, Thebes, and Rome, and this leads him to three stanzas of apos trophe dense with puzzling implications. In what eventually comes to be seen as a characteristic of his style, the lawyer emotes in the high rhetorical mode: O firste moevyng! crueel firmament, With thy diurnal sweigh that crowdest ay And hurlest al from est til occident That naturelly wolde holde another way, Thy crowdyng set the hevene in swich array At the bigynnyng of this fiers viage, That crueel Mars hath slayn this mariage.

Is no tyme bet than oother in swich cas? Of viage is ther noon eleccioun, Namely to folk of heigh condicioun? Noght whan a roote is of a burthe yknowe? Alias, we been to lewed or to slowe! (11. 295?308) A curious passage, indeed, and one that has seemed to many read ers?reasonably enough, given the technical jargon?to call for ex planation by reference to the astrological procedures employed in making "elections" of times for important actions or decisions.7 But if we examine the passage not simply in its purely technical astrological aspects, but rather as a statement made by a lawyer about the mystery of celestial mechanics and human efforts to cope with it, it can be viewed in a somewhat different light. In essence, the Man of Law is appealing to the idea of the lex naturae underlying the "natural mo tions" of the planets, as those motions are countered from the very beginning by the opposing torque of the primus motor, producing a planetary orbit which is actually the resultant of those countervailing forces. For many jurists, such as Chaucer's Italian contemporary, the legal philosopher Lucas de Penna, natural law was simply the expression of the divine will,8 and there is no good reason to think that the Man of 7 On this point, see Chauncey Wood, Chaucer and the Country of the Stars (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1970), pp. 219?34. 8 Walter Ullmann, The Medieval Idea of Law (London: Methuen, 1946), p. 46.</page><page sequence="6">Chaucer's Man of Law, Constancy of Justice 503 Law here views the matter any differently, even though as an Eng lishman he might not have been expected to be much concerned about it. A glossator of one of the manuscripts of the Englishman Bracton's De legibus, for instance, remarks that in England there is less concern for natural law than in any other part of the world.9 The divine plan, of course, utilizes instruments which may themselves be evil, so that the narrator can rightly deplore the "crueel firmament" for bringing about the "crowdyng" responsible for the unfavorable signs by its "diurnal sweigh," hurling all from east to west. This state of affairs seems originally to have been described for the Latin west by Chalcidius, who at one point speaks of the constipatio (crowding) wrought in the heavens,10 and at another describes the operation of the natural and imposed forces moving the stars: epicyclus [solstitialis] intellegatur cum universi mundi uertigine rapi si militer ut ceteri ignes ab oriente in occidentem raptatu cotidiano, ferri tarnen naturaliter aduersum totius mundi uolatum. (the [solar] epicycle is perceived to be hurled along with the entire cosmos just as the rest of the stars are borne from east to west with a daily motion, although they are naturally carried in a direction opposite to the flight of the cosmos.)n The close similarity in phrasing suggests that Chaucer may have been following Chalcidius here, but the idea was repeated by later writers, like the encyclopedist Bartholomaeus Anglicus,12 and there is no urgent need to press Chalcidius as a source. More significant is the fact that the context for this sort of discussion is a cosmological one, having to do in its original Platonic form with the divine "disposition" of things at the beginning of time, a forerunner of the later Christian notion of the lex naturae as the expression of the divine will. But natu ral law from either point of view can be opposed by the fractiousness of created things. The "crueel firmament" thwarts the natural motion of the stars, which brings it about that "crueel Mars" blights the mar riage. Satan inspires human beings to deeds of malice, which makes them choose the evil rather than the good, which the law of na 9Ullmann, p. 46, n. 7.

It is important to stress, it seems to me, that the Man of Law's way of expressing himself makes it quite clear that the stars can be read if philosophers are employed to read them, a precaution which a "pru dent" emperor should take. Men are not absolutely at the mercy of the primus motor. One of the articles condemned at Paris in 1277 by Stephen Tempier, in fact, was the proposition: Quod omnes motus vol untarii reducuntur in primum motorem (That all motions of the will go back to the prime mover). Bradwardine, in his De Causa Dei, refers numerous times to this condemned proposition, and though he seems at times to come very close to denying free will, he regards the con demnation with approval.13 At all events, the Man of Law, merely in terms of his opinion on the uses of astrology, seems orthodox enough for his time. The legal flavor of his comments, however, deepens the question considerably. What he seems to be insinuating through a careful choice of terminology is that there is no need to duplicate in earthly undertakings the cruelty, misfortune, and wrongdoing fig ured forth in celestial signs, especially if one reads them through the eyes of a lawyer. "Tortuous," for example, is beyond any question an astrological term, but it was from very early times confused with "tor tious"?that is, "wrongful" (legal sense)?and in any case, even in the absence of a recorded fourteeth-century instance of such confusion, "tortuous" was likely enough to have been taken as a play on the legal term "tort," coming as it does from the lips of a lawyer.14 The implica tion is that there is a violation of equity if not of law in the treatment accorded Constance. As he goes on, the Man of Law leaves no doubt as to the interpretation an astrologer should have made: Mars is the Sultaness, the same "crueel Mars [who] hath slayn this mariage"; the helpless lord is the Sultan; and the "fieble moone" is Constance. And while the observation "Thou knyttest thee ther thou art nat receyved" defines Constance's Syrian reception accurately enough, the following line, with grim irony, assesses this mariage de convenance which delivers the Christian emperor's daughter into pagan hands precisely as a law yer would be prone to see it: "Ther thou were weel, fro thennes artow weyved." 13 Thomas Bradwardine, De Causa Dei, ed. Henry Savile (London, 1618). See esp. P- 592. 14 See OED, s.v. tortuous. Lat. tortuosus (originally "twisting, winding") had taken on the sense of legal wrongdoing by the fourteenth century; see R. E. Latham, Revised Medieval Latin Word-List (London: Oxford Univ. Press, 1965), s.v. tortitudo. Chaucer would also have been familiar with Ital. torti, "wrongs," as used by Dante (Inferno, XIX, 36). See Singleton, ed., The Divine Comedy, I (Part 1), p. 194.</page><page sequence="8">Chaucer's Man of Law, Constancy of Justice 505 "Weyven" (Lat. waiviare, Mod. Eng. "waive") was a legal term refer ring precisely to the act of placing a woman beyond the pale, outside of any protection she might have had under the law. But "waivery," rather than "outlawry," was the technically proper term, since women were not "in law" to begin with, in the way that men were, a point very clearly made by Bracton.15 We must suppose that the Man of Law is simply using his accustomed vocabulary to describe what Constance's situation amounts to virtually, rather than that he is attempting to pronounce legally on the actions of an emperor far removed in time and place. As purely legal matters, the questions both of the duty of obedience to parents, and of marriage between aliens, are aspects of the jus gentium,16 but there is no suggestion in the poem that the law yer means to present the issues for technical scrutiny. The notion that Constance has in effect been "waived" conveys succinctly a lawyer's conception of the sort of natural wrong involved in this ruthless pater nal act by which a father cruelly invokes his potestas, even while the astrological metaphor protects him?and Chaucer through him? from the anachronistic suggestion that it is really possible to judge the matter from a precise legal standpoint. This sense that the emperor's actions fail in conformity to some un derlying concept of equity without, however, transgressing any stat ute, a matter which would of course have to take into account, in the first place, the position of a sovereign with respect to statute law, con tinues in the Man of Law's description of him as "imprudent." Pruden tia is the virtue traditionally responsible for just and wise decisions. The term, in fact, defines the very science of the law; it is juris pruden tia, and the wise lawgivers of old, traditionally, the prudentes.11 Except for the translation of the story of Prudence and Melibee, forms of the word "prudence" are rare in Chaucer, a fact which adds to its impor tance in the present instance; that it has a strong legal tonality also serves as a key to the tongue-in-cheek compliment the Man of Law 15 Henry of Bracton, De legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae, ed.

For the date 1358, waiviaria is cited in the sense "'waivery,' outlawry of women." 16See Bracton, n, 27, on "the duty of submission to parents and country"; the phrases "strange nacioun" (1. 268) and "Barbre nacioun" (1. 281) are perhaps a reminder of the fact that laws against marriage between aliens are an aspect of the jus gentium, which includes, according to Alberic (Dictionarium, s.v. jus gentium), "connubia inter alien?genas prohibita." Cf. Paul E. Beichner, "Chaucer's Man of Law and Disparitas Cultus" Speculum, 23 (1948), 70-75. 17 The Digesta, for example, opens with an encomium upon the ancient prudentes, whose legal opinions are being set forth in the work. Alberic's Dictionarium contains a discussion under the entry Responsa prudentum.</page><page sequence="9">5o6 Grennen pays to rich merchants in his Prologue by addressing them with the words: "O noble, o prudent folk, as in this cas!" (1. 123). The very sharp distinction between prudence and sapience, which goes back to Plato, had been explained in this way by Chalcidius: Optima porro pars animae ea est quam descripsit Plato duplicem habere uirtutem, unam in comprehensione diuinarum rerum, quae sapientia est, alteram in dispositione rerum mortalium, quae prudentia nominatur. (The finest part of the soul is that which Plato describes as having a two fold power, one for the understanding of divine matters, that is, wisdom; the other for the management of earthly affairs, known as prudence.)18 "Imprudent," therefore, as a characterization of the emperor, helps to point up an underlying contrast between the failings of human positive law and the transcendent justice of divine law. While it is true that the Man of Law does not speak of divine "sapience," he does establish the difference, while remaining within the linguistic bound aries assigned to him, by referring to divine law as God's "prudent purveiance" (1. 483). While it is of course improper to speak of God as possessing distinct attributes such as wisdom, power, knowledge, and so forth, it might be objected that it is in a sense more absurd to say that God has "pru dence" than that He has "wisdom," since prudence is the virtue con cerned with practical decisions, as Aristotle points out in the Ethics (in general conformity with Plato's distinction). "Prudence," he says, "is a genuine habit concerned with action under the guidance of reason, dealing with things good and bad for man," and he notes that we generally regard stewards, or statesmen and rulers, as being possessed of prudence.19 As an example of the imprudent man he mentions Tha?es (wise though not prudent), who was walking in the fields to look at the stars and fell into a ditch,20 an incident referred to, without the reference to Thaies, in the Miller's Tale (11. 3457?60). Although astrological election, unlike speculation about divine things, is clearly an activity well within the range of prudence, so that the Man of Law's description of the emperor as imprudent is not at all inaccurate, his reference to God's "prudent purveiance" is perhaps best understood as an anthropomorphic projection of the virtue to which he himself most emphatically subscribes.

In the stanzas under discus sion, for example, the astrological meaning of "eleccioun," and the question raised about the possibility of preferential decisions for "folk of heigh condicioun," are mere grace notes on the deeper meanings deriving from the idea of "respect of persons" and that of "election of the way," when they are considered in the context of the disparity between the two laws. "Election," it should perhaps be noted, is also the technical term in medieval psychology for the act of choosing be tween alternatives, and in this sense is obviously fundamental to the concept of legal responsibility, as well as to judicial decision making.21 As for preferential treatment, the law in the fourteenth century was still a "respecter of persons," God alone being above such distinctions. The matter is put in perspective by Bracton in the De legibus: "God is no respecter of any men whomsoever, free or bond, 'for there is no respect of persons with God' [Rom. 2:11]. . . . But with men, in truth, there is a difference between persons, for there are some of great eminence [who] are placed above others and rule over them."22 Brac ton goes on to explain that the belief that a king ought to be under the law derives from the analogy with Jesus Christ "whose viceregent on earth he is, for though many ways were open to Him for his ineffable redemption of the human race, the true mercy of God chose this most powerful way [viam . . . elegit] to destroy the devil's work, he would not use the power of force but the reason of justice. Thus he willed himself to be under the law that he might redeem those who live under it."23 The phrase viam elegit, as used in this connection, seems to have been widely repeated, going back at least to the time of Leo Magnus (Pope Leo I, d. 471).24 Thus, the imprudent emperor of Rome, who can make "of viage . . . noon eleccioun," can be seen momentarily as an antitype of Christ; the upshot of his failure to act the part of a Christi figura is to allow his daughter Constance to fall into the clutches of the pagan Sultaness?to be subject, even if briefly, to the law of 21Electio, as an act of the soul, is treated by Aristotle in the De Anima, and is analyzed at length in scholastic commentaries and other treatises deriving from it.

Her being cast adrift in a "steerelees ship" by the Sultaness, an action for which no understandable motivation is offered, provides the Man of Law with an extensive opportunity to demonstrate the ways in which divine governance supplies the deficiencies of human governance. Good governance, after all, is the ideal of a system of laws, the governor the highest embodiment of the jurist. That is why Christ is invoked in precisely the way that He is in the parting words of the Man of Law: Now Jhesu Crist, that of his myght may sende Joye after wo, go ver ne us in his grace, And kepe us alle that been in this place! (11. 1160-62) These words are merely a more abstract, a more overtly "legal" ver sion of the narrator's earlier figurative invocation of the divine governor: O my Custance, ful of benignytee, O Emperoures yonge doghter deere, He that is lord of Fortune be thy steere! (11. 446-48) The ending is the Christian lawyer's formal signature, the earlier pas sage a narrator's trope. That the later passage is a more explicit and generalized version of the earlier is apparent when one considers that the "steerelees ship," like the poorly governed kingdom, is one lacking a proper gubernator, the Latin term for both "helmsman" and "governor." The conception of God as gubernator, with accompanying echoes of a distinction be tween divine and human piloting, is not uncommon. Bradwardine, for instance, in his De Causa Dei, makes the reference rather fre quently. At one point, citing the Book of Wisdom, he notes: "Tu autem Pater gubernas providentia; 8c loquitur de navigatione, &amp; talibus rebus humanis." ("'Thou, Father, governest through providence'; the refer ence is to navigation, and similar human affairs.")25 Again, speaking of Christ's mastery over the sea in walking on the waters, he remarks: "Caro ambulabat, 8c diuinitas gubernabat" ("Flesh walked; divinity pi loted").26 If it seems as though this analysis of language is leading to the suggestion that Chaucer's poetry ought to be read as allegory, I should perhaps emphasize that that seems to me the wrong approach, even in this most apparently allegorical of tales. On the contrary, it seems preferable to regard the energy as flowing in the opposite di rection; the tale, that is to say, is better understood as the poet's con ception, in some ideal sense, of the psychological orientation of a law 25 Bradwardine, p. 589. The quotation is from Wisdom, 14. 26Bradwardine, p. 582.</page><page sequence="12">Chaucer's Man of Law, Constancy of Justice 509 yer toward the world and history, a demonstration of what happens to commonly received ideas and formulations when they are strained through the mind of a man trained in the law, and colored by the intrusion into his narrative of a terminology we must suppose to be second nature to him. Allegorical interpretation asks us to believe that Chaucer says one thing but really means another?that in this case he tells a story about a woman named Constance because he wishes to dramatize the idea of Christian fortitude or steadfastness, in short that the poem is really about an aspect of Christian morality or psychology. But might it not be more accurate to say that the poem is really about the question of why a Man of Law would have a fondness for a certain type of nar rative, and what happens to the available, traditional version of it when he retells it not only with the limitations of his professional legal background but with certain potentialities denied to other narrators. What may seem allegorical about the Man of Law's Tale was to a great extent already allegorical, partly in the hagiographical tradition, but partly also in the penchant of legal theorists to become orotund and figurative about the abstractions underlying their science?to fan tasize with the aid of quaint capitalized entities like Justice, Pity, and Grace about the convolutions of legal theory and principle.27 There was a lingering ritualism of a sort even in the most practical of treatises. For example, for a legal author to discuss, without shifting mental gears, the more bizarre crimes of homicide, rape, mayhem, and (what must have been comparatively unusual even in the four teenth century) the discovery of buried treasure, or the law of flotsam and jetsam, cheek by jowl with ordinary theft, and the more routine questions of ownership and inheritance, produces a somewhat exotic effect. I am inclined to think that at least to some extent the rhetorical instability of the poem's narrator is traceable to a corresponding un evenness of tone even in such respected works as Bracton's De legibus. In that treatise, for instance, following a fairly perfunctory discussion of actions for the recovery of property, we find in quick succession a treatment of l?se-majest? (including forgery), concealment of treasure, wreck, homicide, and rape?crimes, incidentally, which account col lectively for a major portion of the Man of Law's Tale. Simply from this point of view, and with respect to both style and substance, the re ceived story as an aggregation of incidents is well suited for retelling by a Sergeant of the Law. 27 For an account of an allegorical treatment of the six civic virtues that are the guardians of Justitia, see Kantorowicz, Studies in the Glossators, pp. 184?85. Pity and Grace, two of the virtues, are terms appearing frequently in the Man of Law's Tale.</page><page sequence="13">51 o Grennen But even looking at what is ordinarily called "characterization" we can discern deeper points of involvement with the law. As Constance is initially described, the ne plus ultra nature of her physical and moral beauty accords well with the figurative notion of the beauty of the law?that forma legum pulcherrima dwelt upon by the legists. Purport ing to quote the "comune voys of every man," the Man of Law de scribes her as follows: "Oure Emperour of Rome?God hym see!? A doghter hath that, syn the world bigan, To rekene as wel hir goodnesse as beau tee, Nas never swich another as is shee. I prey to God in honour hire susteene, And wolde she were of al Europe the queene. "In hire is heigh beautee, withoute pride, Yowthe, withoute grenehede or folye; To alle hire werkes vertu is hir gyde; Humblesse hath slayn in hire al tirannye. She is mirour of alle curteisye; Hir herte is verray chambre of hoolynesse. Hir hand, ministre of fredam for almesse. (11. 156?68) Now, after making proper allowance for the hyperbole conventional in descriptions of aristocratic beauty, we are still entitled, I would say, on the basis of such imputed excellences as that virtue guides all her works, that she is absolutely free of tyranny,28 worthy to be Queen over all of Europe, and has a heart which is a "chambre of hooly nesse," which accords well with the idea found in Justinian and else where of the law as a religion and of lawgivers as its sacerdotes, to see the portrait as one highly colored by a lawyer's vision of the beauty of the law, or in other words to see Constance as a surrogate for Justitia herself. That a narrative about a woman named Constance, whose unbend ing steadfastness in the throes of exile, calumny, attempted rape, and other crimes, might have struck Chaucer from the outset as having an extraordinary appropriateness to a lawyer's concept of justitia is an allowable inference, I think, simply from the form of the standard definition of justice coined by Ulpian, and repeated, it seems by every legist after him: 28 It is clear that tyranny is the very antithesis of governance by law. Walter Ullmann in The Medieval Idea of Law (p. 188) notes that Lucas de Penna closely follows John of Salisbury in believing that "the tyrant governs, not by laws and decrees based on justice and equity, but by violence and oppression; the idea of law, the idea of justice and righteousness, are alien to him."</page><page sequence="14">Chaucer's Man of Law, Constancy of Justice 511 Iustitia est constans et perpetua voluntas ius suum unicuique tribuens.29 (Justice is the constant and unremitting will to give to each his own law.) Later refinements of this definition, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, show a tendency to make it a permanent aspect of moral character. For example: Justifia ... est animi dispositio, et mentis affectus, qua quis dicitur iustus . . . dum sine personarum acceptione vel distinctione vult cuilibet (quantum in se est) ius suum tribuere. (Justice ... is a disposition of soul, and a habit of mind, by which a person who is called just . . . without any respect or distinction of per sons' wills to render to everyone (in so far as it lies in him to do so) his own law.) That it was also perceived as a virtue enabling its possessor to regard both wealth and poverty with equanimity, can be noted in this version: Justifia est equitas tolerandi inopiam et temperantiam habere in abundantia. (Justice is the capacity for putting up with scarcity equably, and for showing moderation in times of abundance.) There may be some sort of reflection of this notion of justice as a quality enabling one to rise above material circumstance in the Pro logue to the tale, where the invective against poverty (so opposed to the traditional Christian ideal) is perhaps to be taken, along with the praise of "prudent" merchants who seek by land and sea for sources of wealth, as being more facetious than sincere. But Alanus de Insulis, in his Anticlaudianus, also inveighs against poverty;30 the issue is far 29This, and the definitions that follow, are all taken from Alberic's Dictionarium, s.v. justicia. Ulpian's definition, as quoted by Kantorowicz (p. 59), has cuique for unicuique; he also notes that the Digesta reads tribuendi for tribuens. It is of considerable interest, as Ullmann notes (p. 37), that Lucas follows Aquinas, who "amends Ulpian's deficient formula": Reducit (seil. Thomas) autem ad perfectam definitionem justitiae, hoc modo: justitia est habitus, secundum quern aliquis constante et perpetua vol?ntate jus suum unicuique tribuit. ([Thomas] goes back to the perfect definition of justice in this way: justice is the habit, in accordance with which anyone, through a constant and unfailing will, gives to each his own law.) 30 Any detailed discussion of the Prologue would be out of place here. However, in addition to the analysis of Chaucer's use of Pope Innocent's treatise by Robert Enzer Lewis ("Chaucer's Artistic Use of Pope Innocent Ill's De miseria humane conditionis in the</page><page sequence="15">512 Grennen from clear. Finally, justice can be understood as the unflagging dis position to give to everyone not ius but his proper dignitas. Iustitia ... est habitus bonus tribuens cuique suam dignitatem: deo religionem, parentibus obedientiam, maioribus reuerentiam, paribus concordiam, minoribus disciplinam, sibiipsi castimoniam, et pauperibus seu miseris compassionem operosam. (Justice ... is the good habit of rendering to each his own dignity: to God religion, to parents obedience, to elders reverence, to equals har mony, to children instruction, to oneself morality, and to the poor or wretched active compassion.) This last form of the definition sounds almost like an epitome of Constance's career, one in which she obeys the harsh will of her par ents, worships and trusts God under the most unpromising circum stances, treats older worthies such as the Constable and Hermengild with respect and affection, preserves her chastity by fighting off lust ful attackers, and so forth. While, in a passive sense, she never loses her status as an examplar of Christian fortitude?constantia?in the more active sense she seems to embody the very concept ofjustitia as the idea is likely to have been available to Chaucer. Bracton dilates upon the concept at some length, and his own discussion might well have served to make the connection for Chaucer: . . . Justice is said to be constant, in accord with [Ulpian's] definition. [Justice may also be understood in another way, according to the defini tion] which defines justice as in the created: by the word 'will,' 'mind' may be understood, and by 'constant,' 'good,' for constancy is always taken to be good; hence the saints are said to have been constant, and we say 'O the constancy of the martyrs!' By the word 'unfailing,' 'habit' may be understood (also by the word 'constant'). 'Be ye constant,' for constancy does not admit of variation.31 It is clear enough that from any point of view from which the idea of justice might have been viewed in the Middle Ages, constancy was a conspicuous and vital element. This, it seems to me, must have played a major part in Chaucer's decision to assign the tale of Constance to the Man of Law, and to have him end his tale with a prayer to Christ, who sends "joye after wo," to "governe us in his grace," with a vision, that is to say, of a divine system constant in the pattern it offers of bliss following bale, and of law tempered by grace. Man of Law's Prologue and Tale," PMLA, 81 (1966), 485?92), mention should perhaps be made of the treatment of poverty as a vice by Alanus de Insulis in his Anticlaudianus, ed. R. Bossuat (Paris: J. Vrin, 1955), pp. 179-80 [Book VIII, 234-42], as well as the attacks by Wyclif on the friars for affecting external poverty while lacking poverty of spirit. 31Bracton, n, 25.</page><page sequence="16">Chaucer's Man of Law, Constancy of Justice 513 The obviousness of the play on the theological and natural mean ings of "grace" should not obscure the force it derives here from the tacit comparison with forms of legal "grace"?gratia regis, gratia justi tiarorum, gratia cursoria, gratia speciali, and so forth.32 The word "gov erne," also, far from being limited to the notion of the lawful conduct of affairs of state, as deriving figuratively from the concept of guber nator as "pilot," echoes earlier suggestions of failures of personal or family governance, in particular the misuse of the potestas which fa thers, husbands, and male guardians in general have over women, who are "under mannes governance." Without anachronistically claiming Constance for any sort of wom en's suffrage movement, I think we may nevertheless say that a blow is struck in the tale against the inequity of woman's position under civil law, merely by the continuing example of a divine law which makes no distinction of sex, and no distinction of persons. Christ is invoked, significantly, as "Flemere of feendes out of him and here" (1. 460), while the succession of miracles, capped by the celestial hand striking dead the calumniator in the courtroom, shows divine equity curing ills wrought both by the failure of human law (a father misusing his potes tas over his daughter, for example) and by transgressions against di vine law itself, such as Satan's having made an "instrument" of the Sowdanesse, so that the propagation of the law (or lay) of Christianity might be impeded. In short, human positive law emerges in the Man of Law's Tale as something always diminished by comparison with divine law?and the comparison, when it is not explicit, is inherent in the very lan guage of law. The "joye after wo," which the narrator prays for, epito mizes the entire legal framework of the Christ-Man-Satan relation ship?a framework noticed in the references to human "servage" (i.e., bondage to Satan), our promised "heritage," Satan's imprisonment in hell, and so forth. Even the phrase "Bihest is dette," which the law yer quotes out of Justinian, applies as well to Christ's obligation to man as to the Man of Law's obligation to Harry Bailly. And the quota tion, probably also ultimately from the Digest, "For swiche lawe as a man yeveth another wight, / He sholde hymselven usen it, by right" (11. 43-44), is of course both a proverb and a legal maxim, as Robin son points out. But is it not, recognizably, a version of the Golden Rule? It is just this sort of hovering between the concept of the legally right and the concept of that which is morally fine (because in confor 32Bracton uses all these terms and more. See the De legibus, n (176, 207, 279, 284, 538, et passim).</page><page sequence="17">514 Grennen mity with the new law of charity epitomized in the Sermon on the Mount) which creates the special atmosphere of the poem. In short, the tale of Constance, as the statement of a man versed in the law, invites us to scrutinize that lawyer with some amusement, perhaps, at his pretensions and his imperfections. But it also calls upon us to understand that the flawed "practisour" can, when the circumstances of pilgrimage ignite his vision, glimpse the transcendent form of the Law behind the phenomena.</page></plain_text>
