<plain_text><page sequence="1">AFRICAN INFLUENCE IN THE BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE CHRISTINA CHRISTIE University of Texas, Austin, Texas T HE study of the Portuguese language of Brazil divides itself into four periods: the period in which the language was essentially the same as the Portuguese spoken in Portugal; the period in which Indian and African terms were absorbed into Portuguese; the period of the Brazilian language; and the period in which the Portuguese and the Brazilian tend to become coordinated. The Portuguese language introduced into Brazil during the early colon- ization of the country was a language of transition in evolution to its highest peak. This classical Portuguese, as written and spoken in cultural centers, has been essentially the same in Brazil as in Portugal. According to the critic Bezerra de Freitas, The same language of Portugal is dominant in the cultural centers [of Brazil] with only variation in pronunciation, structure, and syntax.' This cannot be said of the language of Brazil as it is spoken by the people and as it is being incorporated into the literature of the nation. During the sixteenth century, the spoken Portuguese of Brazil acquired new terms and new rhythms, and slowly began to change until a mixed tongue evolved. The factors responsible for the breaking-away of the spoken Portuguese of Brazil were (1) the Indians found within the country, (2) the imported African slaves, and (3) the vast extent of the territory. The influence of the first was felt when colonists, explorers, and missionaries came into contact with the Indians. It took two forms, the incorporation of Portuguese words into the Indian dialects and the absorption into Portuguese of Indian terms. The first Portuguese words incorporated into Indian dialects were those related to trading, exploring, preaching, and teaching. The early Indian words incorporated into Portuguese embraced chiefly terms related to fishing and hunting and the names of the plants and animals of Brazil.2 These found their way into Portuguese dictionaries, but in smaller numbers than in actual use. The absorption of Indian words continued from the sixteenth century, 1 Bezerra de Freitas, Hist6ria da Literatura Brasileira, 19.

The African influence made itself felt in Brazil during the seventeenth century, soon after the introduction of Negro slaves from Africa, when original and rhythmical expressions began to appear in the popular lan- guage of the country. This influence grew slowly, gradually replacing that of the Indian. It was an active factor, as is demonstrated by the existence of the mina' and the nag6 dialects in some sections of the country until a short time ago. The first was spoken by the Africans and their descendants in Baia and the second was used extensively in certain ceremonies of the gege-yorubano worship. The third factor in the breaking-away of the Portuguese of Brazil from that of Portugal, territorial extent, gave rise to such great differences that eminent students of the language of Brazil state that the Portuguese of Brazil constitutes a dialect.4 According to Mario Marroquim, We have in Brazil not only one but many dialects or sub-dialects.5 Differences in the spoken language of Brazil have only been delved into in part, again because of the great extent of the country and the diffi- culties in collecting and compiling accurate data for classification. Rodolfo Garcia6 and Antenor Nascentes, among many others, have made linguistic studies, in which dialectological zones have been traced and classifications of the sub-dialects of Brazil made. Renato de Mendonca states, in his excellent work A Influencia Africana no Portugue^s do Brasil, that the language of Brazil may be divided into the following dialects and sub- dialects: caipira dialect, in Sao Paulo; a dialect, with its own character- istics, in Pernambuco and Alag6as; a sub-dialect, of great Indian influence, in ParaS and Amazonas; the sertanejo sub-dialect, in Minas Gerais, the sertdio of Baia, Goiaz and Mato Grosso; and a sub-dialect, influenced by the frontier, in Rio Grande do Sul. He specifies clearly in this work that available facts for the study of such classifications are scarce. The Brazilian language, as spoken by the masses and as spoken casually and within the home, even among the most cultured, is gradually forcing itself into literature, receiving recognition both in Brazil and abroad.

Along with the tendency toward unification of language within Brazil, is a movement for the coordination of the Brazilian and the Portuguese languages. This may be possible in view of the accord of 19318 between the Academia Brasileira de Letras and de Academia de Ciencias de Lisb6a. The Brazilian language, as spoken by the people, has been deeply influ- enced by the African. Renato de Mendon&lt;a9 suggests that the chief influ- ences attribued to the Negro in the spoken language of the masses of Brazil today are the lengthening of the pre-tonic, clarity of speech, and the follow- ing phonetic alterations: the modification of the liquid phoneme lh to the semivowel y, as in mulher which becomes muye; the substitution of a sibil- ant z for j, as in Jose which becomes Zoz6; the simplification of the con- sonant groups which are difficult to pronounce, as in negro which becomes nego; the violent apheresis in which words as estar, voce and Sebastiao which become td, oc&amp;, and Bastiao; the apocope of the final I and r, as in general, cafezal, and cantar which become generd, cafezd, cantd ; the metath- esis of the es combination, as in escuta which becomes secuta; the sub- stitution of the r, which did not exist in Bantd, by 1, as in carro which becomes calo; the rotation of the letters in certain words difficult to pro- nounce, as Claudio and flor which become Culaudio and ful6; and, the reduction of the diphthongs ei and ou to e and o, as in cheiro, queiJo, manteiga, which become chero, qutAjo, manttga. As to morphological changes, there remain only vestiges. The most notice- able is the conservation of plural articles with singular nouns in the speech of the caipira and the matuto ; for example, as casa, os caminho. Characteristics also attributed to the influence of the African slave in- clude the invariability of the personal pronoun Hle, the plural of which is indicated by adding the definite article os, as in osle; the change from am to o in the third person plural of the preterite, particularly noticeable in the Federal District ;1 the loss of d in the gerund and participial forms, in Sato Paulo, as in ano for ando, andano for andando, and pono for pondo ;11 the use of various verbs of direct African origin throughout the country, as mandingar, zangar, carimbar, sambar, and cochilar; the use of certain adjectives which have been incorporated into the local dialect of Pernam- buco and Alag6as, some of which have been accepted into the literature of the country, as cafula; certain word-groupings, as angui-caropo, azeite- de-dend&amp;, angti-de-negro; some folk-lore terms, as Jodio Murundum; popu- ' Eduardo Carlos Pereira, Gramdtica Expositiva, 69.

It is most noticeable in the tales, legends, and folklore of the country, occurring first in the oral literature of the humbler classes and later being incorporated into the literature in written form. Stories, legends, myths, and epic poetry existed in great variety in Africa, as various collections of this oral literature indicate.s3 These were retold from generation to generation by specified persons in each tribe. The tradi- tion was continued in Brazil, and during the time of slavery there were many story-tellers of note who included in their repertoire popular tales, proverbs, sayings, riddles, conundrums, satires, and popular verse in general. One of the most famous of these story-tellers was Pai Jodo, who has been compared to Uncle Remus by Arthur Ramos, in his work O Negro Brasileiro. Pai Jodo, a symbolic figure, represents the story-teller of the plantations. He recounted tales of the slave coast, anecdotes, riddles, and gossip. He was the "good" slave as opposed to the negro do quilombo, a second type of story-teller influential in the formation of Brazil's folklore, who spoke of oppression, the spirit of revolt, and the desire for freedom. A third type of oral literature was expressed by Negro bards in the north- east of Brazil, and its influence, felt in the popular verse of that section of the country, was deep. This literature consisted of poetry and spoke of race relationships; it was usually sung to the viola, in duals; it was spon- taneous, witty, and full of imagination. The most important of these Negro bards was Ignacio da Catingueira, son of an African of royal extraction, who lived in Paraiba. Among many others, the names of Xica Barbosa, a woman, Theodoro Pereira, Manuel Caetano, Azulio, Manuel Preto and Jose Ant6nio have been recorded as outstanding in this field of original composition. A deep thread of Negro influence can be traced in Brazilian folklore. Its exact extent has not yet been established because of difficulty in sepa- rating the similar Indian and African tales found in this type of literature. Arthur Ramos, among many others who have done research in this field, classifies the Brazilian popular tales of African origin as follows: (1) mythical and heroic traditions and tales of mythical entities, ancestors, and powerful heroes; (2) tales inspired in survivals of totemism, including " Ibid., 123. " For example, that of Leo Frobenius.</page><page sequence="5">AFRICAN INFLUENCE IN BRAZILIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 263 animal heroes and gods and anthropomorphic concepts of half-animal, half-human creatures; and (3) historical traditions and stories having a moral. Renato de Mendon&lt;a" divides these tales into three cycles: o cyclo da tartaruga, side by side with the Indian cycle of the jaboti; o cyclo quibungo, entirely African; and o cyclo do yemanjd, which parallels the Indian myth of the Yara and the European myth of the mermaid- a mie d'agua. Tales from these three cycles are cited in Renato de Mendon&lt;a's work O Negro no Folklore e na Literatura do Brasil,'" including the Brazilian tale known in the State of Sergipe as O kdgado e o teizd, a version of the African tale Al8 sobre a tartaruga e o elefante; the Afro-Brazilian tale O quibungo e o homen; and A mie d'agua, a Brazilian tale influenced by the African myth of the Yemanjd. The influence of the African slave was felt within the family and by the humbler classes. Although great, it was not sufficient to create a literary current as did the Indian influence, even during the period of abolition when a considerable movement was under way. The Negro influence in Brazilian literature is of two types: a Negro motif, which inspired Brazil- ian writers, and the contribution of Negro writers. We find the first traces of African influence in the poetry of Greg6rio de Mattos Guerra, who introduced Negroes and mulatas in his satires directed against the society of Baia during the seventeenth century. One of his poems, entitled Romance,'" dedicated to a mulata called Cordula, marks the beginning of the Negro motif in Brazilian literature. The Negro motif appears increasingly during the slave era, expressed in the themes of martyrdom, suffering, and longing for freedom. Trajano de Galvdo left a well-known poem, Crioula,y7 in which he disregards the gaiety and playfulness of the Negro to dwell on the passionate nature of the race. Celso Magalhaes and Vicente de Carvalho relate the story of a runaway slave in their poems Os Calhambolas and Fugindo do Cativeiro. Melo Morais Filho, in his Canto do Ecuador and Mitos e Poemas, gives us the first true-to-fact pictures of the Negro. He relates the departure of the slaves from Africa, their life in slavery, and their fetish practices. Castro Alves, who really belongs in the second group of writers because he was of Negro descent, was the great abolitionist poet of Brazil. He used the Negro motif to produce his immortal V6zes d'Africa, 0 Navio Negreiro, and A Cachoeira de Paulo Affonso.' His enthusiasm, great " Renato de MendonCa, O Negro no Folklore e n;a literatura do Brasil, in Estudos Afro-Brasileiros, 8.

The Negro motif continued in use after the freeing of the slaves, but to a lesser degree. The poems Bongo, by Raimundo Correa, and Palmares, by Silvio Romero, as well as the modern work of Guilherme de Almeida, Rafa, and that of Raul Bopp, Urucungo, should not escape notice. Among Brazilian prose writers, Jose de Alencar, the great Indianist of Brazil, used the Negro motif in two of his dramatic works, A Mi~e and O Dem6nio Familiar; Bernardo Guimardes contributed with his Pdginas ou Uma Hist6ria de Quilombolas; Machado de Assiz, with his shortstory o Caso da Vara; Graca Aranha with a work depicting the macumba, A Viagem Maravilhosa; Paulo Barreto, in As Religiojs no Rio; and, Pedro Calmon with his Males, describing the insurrection in the senzalas. The Negro has been the inspiration of some of the great Brazilian novels, as 0 Feiticeiro, by Xavier Marques, which describes the nag6 soul and many fetish practices; O Rei Negro, by Coelho Netto, describ- ing the hardships and dissolution of the Negro in the State of Rio de Janeiro; Fruta do Mato, by Afrinio Peixoto, describing the fetishism of the Negro; Furundugo, by Souza Carneiro; and the great social novels, Aluizio de Azevedo's O Mulato, Jorge Amado's Jubiabid,'9 and Lins do Rego's Bangue.20 Within the last decade Negro literature has assumed vast proportions, appearing in poems and novels and in excellent studies such as O Negro Brasileiro, by Arthur Ramos; Os Mitos Africanos no Brasil, by Souza Carneiro; A Influencia Africana no Portuguds do Brasil, by Renato de Mendona; O Animismo Fetichista dos Negros Baianos, by Nina Rodri- ques; Casa Grande e Senzala, Mucambos e Sobrados, and Nordeste, by Gilberto Freyre; and the publications of the Primeiro Congresso Afro- Brasileiro,21 Estudos Afro-Brasileiros and N6vos Estudos Afro-Brasileiros. The contributions of Negro writers to the literature of Brazil are many and important throughout all periods after the eighteenth century. No works are to be found prior to that date because it was only during the eighteenth century that schooling opportunities made it possible for the Negro to include among his activities literary skill. Jose Basilio da Gama, of the Escola Mineira, was the first great Negro contributor to the literature of Brazil. His work, O Uruguai, was the out- standing epic of the colonial period. It depicted the efforts of the Portuguese and Spaniards against the Sete P6vos das Misso~s do Uruguai. Vigorous of expression and of sonorous style, it contains many beautiful passages, "1 Published in 1935. " Published in 1934. ' Held in Recife, 1934.</page><page sequence="7">AFRICAN INFLUENCE IN BRAZILIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 265 among them the tragic death-scene of Lind6ia, A Morte de Linddia.22 Another contributor of this early period was Caldas Barbosa, a mulato, who improvised songs which were sung to the music of a zviola both in Brazil and Portugal. Besides a collection of songs, Viola de Lereno, he produced two theatrical pieces and one long poem. He was very popular in his day. Jose de Natividade Saldanha, also a mulato, wrote poems which were really patriotic hymns. His best-known verses are those in which he sings of the heroes of the Dutch wars, especially Henrique Dias. During the first half of the nineteenth century, Ant6nio Gonqalves Teixeira e Souza, Ant6nio Gongalves Dias, and Laurindo Rebelo made valuable contributions to the Brazilian literature of the period. Teixeira e Souza, a poet, was a carpenter of the small village of Cabo Frio who moved to the capital and became a clerk in a commercial house in order to be nearer the center of literary activities. Without any background for literary work at all, he produced the very popular Os Tres Dias de Um Noivado and Cantos Liricos. Ant6nio Goncalves Dias, son of a mameluca of Maranha'o, was the greatest pantheistic poet of Brazil and is one of the great poets of the Portuguese language. His works, characterized by lyrical intensity, include Primeiros Cantos, D. Leonor de Mendonpa, Segundos Cantos, Sextilhas de Frei Antdo, Os Timbiras, and Oltimos Cantos.23 He sang of the three races from which the Brazilian evolved in his Sextilhas de Frei Ant~o, Escrava, and the great Indian poems Os Timbiras, Can~io do Tamoio and Y-Iuca-Piramna.24 His best-known poem is the Canplio do Exilio,25 in which he sings of the sabia in the palmtrees of his native land. Its intense lyric expression and feeling make it unfor- gettable. Laurindo Rebelo was a popular and versatile lyric poet. His satires and rebellious expressions were deeply appreciated by his contempo- raries. In the middle of the nineteenth century many works appear, among them Dias e Noites by Tobias Barreto; the works of the great Castro Alves already mentioned; the satire, A Bodarrada, and the poems of filial devo- tion, Minha Mde and No Cemiterio de S. Benedito, by the Negro leader, politician, and journalist Luiz Gama; Missal, prose, and Broqueis,26 poems, by Cruz e Souza, in which a rising spiritual current is noticed; and the works of Gongalves Crespo,27 whose Brazilian poems A Sesta, Alguem, Na roca, Canpio, Ao meio dia, A negra, and As velhas negras, written abroad, are full of the sweetness of longing for his native land.

Of the prose writers, Lima Barreto stands out on account of his chron- icles of suburban life, together with the abolitionist journalists Andre Rebou;as, Jose do Patrocinio, and Ferreira de Menezes. Many names appear among the younger generation, such as those of Hermes Fontes, Correia Junior, Solano Trindade, Couto de Magalhaes, and Lino Guedes, in the field of poetry; and Fernando G6is, Mario Enrique de Almeida, and Francisco Lucrecio, novelists. The works of Jorge de Lima, novelist and poet, are outstanding both from a literary viewpoint and because of the excellent treatment of the Negro motif. The poems Essa negra Ful6 and Pai Joao28 offer good descriptions of the life of the Africans in Brazil during the slave era. They are especially interesting because typical African modes of speaking, thinking, and feeling are expressed in good Portuguese, but a Portuguese redolent of Africa. BIBLIOGRAPHY I.
