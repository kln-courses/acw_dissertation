Printed in the Netherlands. Kutztown University, Pennsylvania, USA Introduction Perhaps there are no moral ideas more fundamental than those of the good and the right. When we deliberate on the good life to live, we often want to know what is the nature of human being. In this sense, our ideas of the good are often (though not always) connected with certain religious (in its broadest sense) views of the ultimate reality. When we think about the right thing to do, we often want to know what is the proper human relationship. In this sense, our ideas of the right are often (though not always) inseparable from certain political conceptions of a just society. Metaphorically, therefore, religious ideas of the good "vertically" relate human beings to the ultimate reality, while political ideas of the right "horizontally" connect human beings with each other.1 What is then the proper relationship between people's reli- gious ideas of the good and their political ideas of the right in a religiously plural society? Influential in today's public discourses, on the one hand, there is a political liberal "the-right-prior-to-the-good" principle: since different people within a society hold very different religious ideas of the good, the political idea of the right, on the basis of which a society's coercive laws and public policies are to be established, has to be derived form some hypothetical procedure that transcends these parochial perspectives.2 On the other hand, there is a religious communitarian "the-good-prior-to-the-right" principle: people's political ideas of the right are superficial unless embedded in some religious ideas of the good related to the ultimate reality.3 These two different positions have underlined two important aspects of our central question. For liberals, the universal political idea of the right can not rely upon any single one of plural religious ideas of the good; for communi- tarians, no political ideas of the right can be entirely separated from religious ideas of the good. However, a serious problem with the liberal position is its Utopian idea of the context-transcending procedure form which a neutral political idea of the right is supposed to be derived; a potential danger of the</page><page sequence="2">148 YONG HUANG communitarian approach is its tendency either to a political sectarianism or to a religious imperialism. The task of this article, however, is not to provide a detailed analysis and criticism of these two positions.4 It rather aims to develop an alternative that can avoid their respective problems and take into serious account their respective insights. In the following, I shall propose the idea of reflective equilibrium as such an alternative. In the first section, I shall discuss the reflective equilibrium between the religious idea of the good and the political idea of the right, together with many other background ideas, within an individual's belief system; in the second section, I shall discuss the communal nature of our beliefs, religious and political as well as any others, maintained in a reflective equilibrium among different individuals' belief systems; in the third section, I shall make a distinction between the political communal conception of the right which is singular and religious communal views of the good which are plural; and in the last section, I shall show how a reflective equilibrium between the plural religious communal ideas of the good and the singular political communal conception of the right is important and possible. My conclusion is that the proper relationship between religious goodness and political lightness has to be sought, obtained, and maintained, not in any principle of priority, liberal or communitarian, but in their reflective equilibrium, on both individual and plural levels. 1. Reflective equilibrium within a belief system The central question of this article is then about religion and politics. However, unlike the familiar discussion that sees them as two institutions: church and state, this article approaches them as two parts of our belief system: religious ideas of the good and political ideas of the right. The appropriate relationship between religion and politics is thus to be pursued in the context of the relationship of beliefs within and among belief systems. One way to look at this relationship is related to the fact that we naturally try to keep our belief system in certain degree of coherence or at least free from gross contradictions. This coherence is not obtained by fixing up any Achimedean point and then tailoring all other beliefs to it but by moving back and forth and among different parts of our belief system until a mutual support among them is obtained. The achieved coherence is, however, only provi- sional because new tensions will emerge, either because some previously unrecognized implications of the beliefs within the system or because of some external challenges. I am here using reflective equilibrium to characterize such a view of our belief system. From such a view, neither our religious idea of the good nor our political idea of the right (nor any background beliefs) is foundational. What is needed is to bring them into mutual influ-</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 1 49 ence, challenge, and transformation until a reflective equilibrium is reached between them (together with other background beliefs). Often a change in our religious ideas of the good may dictate a corresponding change in our political ideas of the right and vice versa. However, neither of them has any logical, metaphysical, or genetic priority. In this sense, the idea of reflective equilibrium is directly against the realist view "that statements of the disputed class possess an objective truth-value, independently of our means of knowing it: they are true or false in virtue of a reality existing independently of us."5 In this realist view, we can not hold whatever beliefs that can be made coherent with other beliefs in our system. After all, it is possible to hold a perfectly coherent but entirely false belief system.6 While such a criticism seems to be strong, I believe it has its own problem. Even if it were true, realism could offer us no help in constructing and justifying our beliefs: we can never get in touch with the reality that exists in itself; nor can we possibly know when we get in touch with it even if we could. Indeed, as Timothy Jackson has keenly pointed out, if we have already had, or can have, direct access to this reality, why bother to test our beliefs against it.7 Moreover, the idea of reflective equilibrium does not have to deny the idea of reality. It is agreed that our beliefs are what we use to cope with reality and therefore a reflective equilibrium within a belief system has to be maintained in the process of its continuing interaction with reality. Of course we have no way to check whether our beliefs accurately (or more accurately than others) represent the independent reality. What we do know, however, is not only whether our beliefs are coherent but also whether they can help us cope with reality successfully (or more so than others).8 The idea of reflective equilibrium is also at odds with foundationalism, according to which, a belief system is built upon some infallible foundations. Realism can be a foundationalism, but foundationalism does not have to be a realism. As a matter of fact, the strongest defense of foundationalism today is not realism but internalism, according to which, "if any beliefs are to be justified at all ... there must be some terminal beliefs that do not owe their credibility to others."9 Without such terminal beliefs as foundation, it is believed, our justification of beliefs would have to face either an infinite regress (justifying one belief by another without an end) or a vicious circle (justifying one belief by the other, which is in turn to be justified by the one). An obvious problem with such a foundationalism is that nowhere can we locate the needed terminal beliefs. Some of our beliefs may have their role in justifying other beliefs but they themselves also need justifications form other beliefs. Empirical beliefs, on the one hand, may be used to construct our theoretical conceptions but they themselves are always theory-laden.10 Our clear and distinct ideas, on the other, can guide our empirical inquiry but</page><page sequence="4">150 YONG HUANG they are themselves supported by our empirical observations.11 Of course, at any given time, we can always rely upon certain beliefs to formulate or judge about our other beliefs. In this case, they are playing the de facto role of foundation of our belief system. However, we can never tell which beliefs can play such a role; nor can we be sure that beliefs that play such a role today will do so tomorrow. Moreover, the idea of reflective equilibrium can avoid the problem that foundationalists claim it must have: infinite regress or vicious circle. Our belief system is holistically constituted. In this belief system, while no one can be taken as the final or absolute foundation of all other beliefs and the system as a whole, every one functions as a partial foundation for other beliefs and the system itself. The certainty of our belief system and our beliefs in the system do not come from any absolutely certain beliefs but from the mutual support of all these otherwise uncertain beliefs in the system. So, there is certainly a circle here, but it is definitely not a vicious one.12 Finally, the idea of reflective equilibrium is a falliblism. This is not simply to say that all beliefs in the system are fallible and subject to revisions or even rejections. This is also to say that the very equilibrium obtained among these beliefs has to be kept in a constant remaking. In other words, while we are searching for a belief system in an equilibrium, it is not something that, once sought, we should preserve by keeping it immune to any further changes. We shall always allow new tensions to occur as they may, either by more critically reflecting upon beliefs in the system or by opening the system up to new candidates for its membership. When new tensions occur, it is important for us to search for a new equilibrium, which may be lost again, in our further moving back and forth between our different beliefs and in our continuing encounter with new beliefs. This is not simply because, as Rorty points out, our mind can not stand incoherence; it is also because an incoherent belief system can not help us cope with reality successfully. Such an anti-realistic, anti-foundational, and falliblistic idea of reflective equilibrium itself is of course not alien to either liberals or communitarians. As a matter of fact, many of them have made the most important contribu- tions to this idea in recent philosophical discussions.13 However, liberals and communitarians seem to agree that our belief system can be split up in the middle into two compartments: religious and their allied beliefs concerned about the ultimate reality and political and their allied belief concerned about the interpersonal relationship. They have no problem with the idea of reflective equilibrium within either compartment, but hold that beliefs in one compartment can be seen as woven independently of, and founda- tional to, beliefs in the other: they disagree with each other only on which compartment, religious or political, is foundational.</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 151 Of course, at any given time, some of our beliefs are serving as a founda- tion of our belief system, not only because we often use these beliefs to justify our other beliefs, but also because, for the moment, we can not imagine that they will turn out to be false. For liberals, our political convictions such as equal liberty of conscience, rejection of slavery and serfdom, and individual freedom belong to that category, since they have been "reasonably taken as fixed, as correctly settled once for all."14 For communitarians, it is our reli- gious beliefs that should be regarded as such, since to say a conviction is religious is precisely to say that one "is likely to follow, or at least to think that she should follow, that conviction in spite of any reasons she might have for doing otherwise."15 Here both liberals and communitarians fail to realize that a belief seems to us foundational not because of its inherent infallibility but because it can help us to make our belief system coherent and to cope with the reality successfully. Yet beliefs that seem to some people so self-evidently true may not be so to other people or to themselves sometimes later. The beliefs, for example, that women are unequal to men, that slaves are unequal to masters, and that blacks are unequal to whites, once seemed to many of our ancestors self-evidently true but are now almost universally denounced as false. Moreover, a belief seems to us self-evidently true, "not because it is intrinsically obvious and convincing; it is rather held fast by what lies around it."16 For example, the "considered judgments" that Rawls wants to collect from the public culture seems to us self-evidently true not because they can stand independently from our other beliefs, as he assumes, but precisely because they have been tightly embedded in these beliefs, including religious ones, that we also cherish. If we put the background beliefs in brackets as he suggests, these considered judgments will no longer be self-evident to us. While directly opposing each other, Liberals and communitarians here share some form of reductionism that is attacked by Quine as one of the two dogmas of empiricism.17 For liberals, religious and philosophical world- views are nothing but summaries of or induction from more concrete views, political ones included. It is clear, therefore, that our political and other concrete beliefs must function as premises from which religious conclusions can be induced and to which they can be reduced.18 In contrast, for communi- tarians, political ideas and other concrete theories are nothing but particular applications of our general religious and philosophical world-views. Obvi- ously, therefore, religious world- views must function as premises from which our political and other concrete ideas can be deduced and into which they can be reduced. It is of course true that sometimes religious world- views can be derived from and justified by political and other particular convictions, just as it is true that sometimes religious world- views can function as the source from which political and other concrete convictions can be derived and by</page><page sequence="6">152 YONG HUANG which justified. However, we can not say that, because of the former, religious world-views are nothing but induction from political and other particular convictions or , because of the latter, political and other particular convictions are nothing but the deduction from religious world- views. Religious world-views and political ideas, together with many other convictions, are all constitutive parts of our belief system. In light of the idea of reflective equilibrium I have been defending, we have no way but to justify one part of our beliefs in light of others. Thus, when we derive our political and other convictions from, or justify them according to, our reli- gious beliefs, our religious beliefs do function as their sources and measures; when we construct or justify our religious beliefs in light of our political and other convictions, our political and other convictions do become their sources and measures. However, onto-genetically, neither has to be admitted into a belief system before the other; onto-logically, neither has the inherent power to trump the other. Thus, a better way to understand the relationship between religious and other metaphysical world-views on the one hand and political and other concrete views on the other is that, while the former is our approach to the world as a whole, the latter is our perspectives on its different parts. Our view of the world as a whole of course can not be independent from our views of its different parts and vice versa. Our better conception of the world as a whole (our better religious world- view) can help us obtain better understanding of a specific part of the world (our better political ideas), which can in turn help us to have a better insight of the world as a whole. It is in this open-ended process that we can improve these two parts of our belief system, together with many other parts, at the same time. 2. Reflective equilibrium among belief systems My discussion so far has focused on the reflective equilibrium within an individual belief system. While such a reflective equilibrium is important and indispensable, it is incomplete in itself and weak as an alternative to the liberal and communitarian positions. On the one hand, it is open to another found- ationalist objection: there may be many different and incompatible belief systems which are equally coherent and we have no non-arbitrary choice among them.19 On the other hand, neither liberals nor communitarians are primarily concerned with how beliefs are related to each other in an indi- vidual's belief system but how different individuals' belief systems are related to each other within a community. Thus, the reflective equilibrium they are interested in is what John Rawls now calls general reflective equilibrium.20 Therefore, they might well admit that there are no good reasons for the priority either of the right to the good (for liberals) or of the good to the</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 153 right (for communitarians) within an individual's belief system. Yet, they would insist that the order of priority has to be maintained if we shift our focus from the reflective equilibrium within a belief system to the reflective equilibrium among belief systems. Aware of the actual religious plurality, liberals believe that the reflective equilibrium among people's political ideas of the right can be reached only by transcending their religious ideas of the good and, once reached, can be used to regulate them. Having in mind the potential moral fragmentation, communitarians hold that there is a need for the reflective equilibrium among people's religious ideas of the good, which, once reached, can be used to regulate people's conflicting political ideas of the right so that a reflective equilibrium among these political ideas can be maintained accordingly. Thus, in order both to respond to the foundationalist objection and to develop a viable alternative to the liberal and communitarian positions, it is important to expand the reflective equilibrium from the individual level to the communal level. Indeed, I shall argue, the reflective equilibrium within a belief system can be maintained only by maintaining a reflective equilibrium among belief systems at the same time, just as the reflective equilibrium among belief systems can be maintained only by maintaining a reflective equilibrium within each of these belief systems at the same time. To do so, we can no longer rest content with the internal coherence of our own belief systems but need to expose them to those of others. In this process, while we should try our best to show others why our beliefs are true, we should also be prepared to give up our beliefs if they are shown to be false. It is a risky business, therefore, in the sense that we may end up having to sacrifice some of our most cherished beliefs. There is a serious question raised by Michael DePaul, however, about this radical openness to other belief systems that deserves our special attention. According to DePaul, it is of course all well and good if it is within our own power to decide to let go of some of our cherished old beliefs and admit some new beliefs that initially seem strange to us. In this process, we will obtain a reasoning experience in the sense that our decision is made on the basis of our other beliefs that we believe are more fundamental. However, it is also possible that encountering other belief systems may cause us to give up our whole belief system or at least the most fundamental part of it, as happens in religious conversions or psychological Gestalt switches or scientific paradigm shifts. In this process, we will undergo a formative experience in the sense that we are led to alter the fundamental structure of our beliefs in a way that is not determined by our "previous degrees of belief in the propositions involved and logical relations among them."21 Now it is still all right if this formative experience is positive and enriching in the sense that our original</page><page sequence="8">154 YONG HUANG belief system is illusive while the new one is insightful. However, it is also possible to have a corruptive formative experience in the sense that we are led to give up an originally insightful belief system to accept a new but illusive one. In light of this, DePaul asks, are we still able to justify the radical openness to other belief systems as we argue is necessary to obtain the reflective equi- librium among different belief systems? This is a hard question, but we have to answer it positively.22 Except in the case of brainwashing, I believe that the distinction between reasoning experiences and formative experiences is only in degree and not in kind. Our exposure to other belief systems can lead us to make some changes or adjustments of our own belief systems, however dramatic they are, only when we weigh by reasoning that it is worth our doing so. As long as we are not talking about someone who uses force to take our old beliefs out of us and install new ones into us from outside (as in the case of brainwashing), what matters in this process is always our belief that our previous beliefs have encountered incurable anomaly, failure, or even crisis and that the new beliefs we learn from others promise to overcome them. In this sense, the conversion that our formative experience brings out is not entirely independent of our reasoning experience: our weighing some beliefs (old ones) against some others (new ones we encounter in public discourses). This of course does not exclude what DePaul calls negative formative experiences. It is always possible that some belief systems we encounter are illusive and that these illusive beliefs exercise their negative influences upon us, especially if we are naive or lack the necessary critical thinking ability. However, the best way to deal with these corruptive belief systems, to avoid their negative influences, and to enhance our critical thinking ability is not to close but open our belief systems to them. First of all, the very question of what is illusive and what is insightful itself, just as many other questions, can be appropriately answered only by encountering more and more alternative belief systems; moreover, to enhance our critical thinking ability and to avoid corruption by an illusive belief system is not to avoid this belief system but to encounter it, together with many other alternative belief systems. Only when we have different alternative beliefs in front of us can we start to think more critically about which is justified and which is not and, therefore, avoid the corruptive formative experience; finally, one of the important aspects of reflective equilibrium is that, when we encounter alternative beliefs, we are not only trying to learn form them but also to challenge them. In this sense, even if we know that a belief system is corruptive, this is not a reason for us to avoid it. For example, our encounter with an obviously corruptive belief system such as Nazism is indeed unlikely to enrich us but it may be enriching to those who hold this belief system and this can also be a good reason for us</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 1 55 to engage it. Of course, it is always a question about to what degree we can really enrich the experiences of those who hold corruptive belief systems in this way, since in most cases they hold these beliefs not because they think that they are true but because they want to use them as excuses for their selfish, immoral, and cruel behaviors. However, I believe Charles Taylor is right: while we should not have the illusion that we can prevent these people form committing selfish, immoral, and cruel activities simply by means of public discourses, it will certainly make it harder for them to do so by refuting the excuses they might have for conducting these activities openly.23 In light of these, it is clear that the reflective equilibrium within a belief system and the reflective equilibrium among belief systems have to be searched for, obtained, and constantly reconstructed in the same process. It is impossible for us to maintain a reflective equilibrium among belief systems without maintaining a reflective equilibrium within each of these individual belief systems at the same time. A genuine reflective equilibrium among belief system is not to be obtained by pre-establishing some foundational beliefs, either our political ideas of the right or our religious ideas of the good, and then aligning all individual belief systems with them. It is obtained rather by achieving an overlapping consensus among individual belief systems. Therefore, to maintain a reflective equilibrium among different individuals' belief systems, religious or political, there is no need for the liberal priority of the right to the good or the communitarian priority of the good to the right. A change within one's belief system may legitimately ask for an adjustment of the communal belief system, just as a change of the communal belief system may also legitimately require an adjustment within an individual's belief system. 3. Political solidarity and religious plurality I have argued that both our religious ideas of the good and our political conceptions of the right, together with our other beliefs, are communal beliefs maintained in a reflective equilibrium among belief systems of different individuals in the community. However, it is important to realize that, in a religiously plural society, the political community includes all members of the society and therefore the political communal belief is the one shared by all its members. In contrast, a religious community is only one of many communities within the political community and therefore the religious communal belief is the one shared only by members of this particular reli- gious community. It is my contention that a religiously plural and politically communal society is not only a social reality many of us have to live with but is also a moral ideal that we all should defend. Without a universally</page><page sequence="10">156 YONG HUANG shared political communal conception of the right, the society will lack a moral foundation for its coercive laws and public policies with universal reach; without plural religious communal ideas of the good, however, the society would (among others) lack resources to nurture the needed political consensus. Therefore, I shall argue that, in a religiously plural society, it is important to have what Richard Rorty calls political solidarity and religious plurality. The question is then how such a society with political solidarity and reli- gious plurality is possible and whether our ideas of reflective equilibrium is adequate to it. Rorty himself takes what seems to me a wrong turn. He divides the society into the public (state) and the private (individual life). In this dichotomy, since plural religions are considered as belonging to the private sphere and having nothing to do with the public sphere, the polit- ically solidary society of course does not need to set any limitations upon them.24 Such a dualistic division of society, together with its characteriza- tion of religion as private, however, is problematic: it ignores the function of religion as voluntary associations, mediating between the public political state and the private individual life and relating individuals to state and state to individuals.25 As Max Stackhouse points out, human beings are joiners,26 but there are two fundamentally different ways people can join each other to form communities: voluntary and non- voluntary. A voluntary association, by definition, is the community voluntarily associated, in which an individual has "the freedom to be or not to be a participant."27 Here, interestingly enough, as pointed out by James Luther Adams, the idea of community is associated with the idea of individual freedom. It is important to see, there- fore, that freedom can not be simply defined as freedom of belief or of speech or of self-determination. Definitions of this sort, "center attention too much upon the individual as an isolated entity; thus they fail to take explicitly into account the institutional ingredient, namely, the freedom to form, or belong to, voluntary associations that can bring about innovation or criticism in the society."28 If voluntary association is governed by the principle of voluntarism and people are free to join and withdraw, would it be ideal to have a state modeled on the voluntary association? Michael Walzer makes an important point when he says that "the citizens are free, of course, to set up a club, make member- ship as exclusive as they like, writer a constitution, and govern one another. But they cannot claim territorial jurisdiction and rule over the people with whom they share the territory."29 In other words, people can freely form voluntary associations, only because of the existence of the non-voluntary association that can regulate not only the relationship among associations but also certain aspects of the relationship among individuals within and without</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 1 57 the associations. This is the function of the state, which not only frames such associations but also occupies spaces within them. In Walzer's word, "it fixes the boundary conditions and the basic rules of all association activity (including political activity)."30 In this sense, the political state is a non- voluntary association, "to which everyone in the territory belongs without choice. In principle, one has no choice as to whether one will be or will not be under the political jurisdiction of the territory."31 This, of course, does not mean that individuals do not have the freedom at all to choose in which polit- ical state to stay, as they do not have the freedom to choose in which state to be born. What it really emphasizes is that, in addition to the obvious difficulty of moving form one political state to another, the state is not established on some pre-established goals so that those who share these goals are free to join, while those who have different goals are free to leave. It is rather established for people who are already living in this territory or happen to be born there, however diverse their goals are. Therefore it is important for the state to nurture the common purposes shared by all who are living in this territory. In other words, to individuals and voluntary associations that disagree on political principles under which the state is run, the state in principle can not say something like this: "these are our political principles. If you like them, stay with us and, if not, go somewhere else or to organize your own state." Instead, the state has either to reformulate its political principles in light of the dissenting points of view or persuade (or, if not possible, coerce) them to adhere to the existing principles. Thus, in contrast to the voluntary association whose principle is voluntarism, the principle of the state as non- voluntary association is coercion.32 I believe that this distinction between religious community as voluntary and political state as non-voluntary can help us better understand why it is important for a society both to construct a singular political communal conception of the right among all its citizens and allow plural religious communal ideas of the good within its different religious communities. It is wrong to try to maintain a universal consensus among people's religious beliefs in correspondence to a similar one among people's political ideas of the right. People who think that we could and should do so often appeal to the problematic idea of civil or civic religion.33 Such a civil religion may be what Richard Neuhaus criticizes as the common denominator of all religions, or Robert Bellah's common religion additional to all historical religions, or Franklin Gamwell's universalized historical religions.34 In all these cases, the universal civil religion is understood as necessary for the state laws and policies. However, since the state laws and policies are coercive, the civil religion would thus become coercive too: one could not support the former without supporting the latter. In this sense, a civil (civic) religion is no longer</page><page sequence="12">158 YONG HUANG a voluntary association.35 If such a civil religion is supposed to replace the historical religions that are voluntary, the individual freedom to join others religiously will be violated; if it is supposed to be a coercive political reli- gion as public in addition to all voluntary religious associations as private, the unique function of these voluntary associations as mediating structures between individuals and state will be undermined. Therefore, religious plurality is important not because religion is only related to individual life. Religion is a social phenomenon and one holds a religious belief never entirely in isolation but always in a social context: one wants to join others who hold similar beliefs. Of course one is free to hold whatever religious beliefs and to join whatever religious community and it is precisely this freedom to join (as well as to withdraw from) the association which mediates between individuals and state that justifies religious plurality. Naturally, people try to reach a consensus on their religious beliefs within their freely associated community. When such a consensus is impossible, they may decide to reconfigure their community, often together with other volun- tary communities, into distinct communities, each with its own communal belief system kept within a reflective equilibrium among belief systems of its members. They are, however, not expected to maintain a similar reflective equilibrium with people from different religious communities. This is of course not to say that there should be no dialogue between or among different religious communities or such a dialogue will have no effect on the belief systems of these communities. Inter-religious dialogues will often result in the Gadamerian fusion of horizons and it is through such fusion of horizons that people can better understand themselves and society. However, such dialogues and the resulting fusions of horizons are fully compatible with the idea of religious plurality.36 Similarly, it is wrong to try to maintain a political pluralism in corres- pondence with the religious pluralism. In a strong sense, political pluralism is the view that the state should allow different and even contradictory laws and public policies made according to people's different and even conflicting political ideas. The problem with such a view is obvious and I do not think that there is anyone seriously advocating it. In a week sense, political pluralism can mean that the state should be indifferent on those political matters on which citizens have disagreements. This could be done by refraining from making any laws on these matters, by nurturing the virtue of political acquiescence among its citizens and voluntary associations, and by using its coercive power when people are not content to go their own ways but want to force others to follow them.37 The question is: if some political idea such as slavery, Nazism, and patriarch seem to us obviously wrong, why should we be acquiescent about them?38 Moreover, it is difficult to imagine a</page><page sequence="13">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 159 well-ordered society can, for example, let one group of people practice capital punishment and ask them not to apply it to others who disagree on the capital punishment: those who are to be capitally punished would almost certainly claim that they do not agree on capital punishment! In a well-ordered society, laws and public policies must have a universal reach. For this purpose, it is important to develop a consensus within a society among people's political ideas of the right as the moral foundation of these universally applicable coercive laws and public policies. The political pluralism that I am arguing against here, however, should be carefully distinguished from the political pluralism that I would like to defend: a political community should not only allow but encourage different voices on political matters. Political pluralism in this sense is not contra- dictory but essential to the very idea of the universal consensus on political rightness within a society as the foundation of a well-ordered society with universally applicable laws and public policies. Such a political consensus is not a compromise among people's existing political ideas of the right but an agreement on moral ideas and so it is important to allow dissenting opinions to be voiced even when such a consensus is already at hand, since only from dialogues among diverse opinions can we make moral progress. Of course, it is one thing to allow people to have different political ideas; it is another to put all these different ideas in a political system. With the latter, the society would be in chaos; without the former, the society would be unable to make moral progress. 4. Reflective equilibrium between communal political convictions and communal religious beliefs In the first section, I have argued that there should be a reflective equilibrium between religious ideas of the good and political ideas of the right, together with many other ideas, in an individual's belief system. In the second section, I have argued that people's belief, whether religious or political or otherwise, are always communal beliefs maintained in a reflective equilibrium among different individuals' belief systems. In the last section, I have argued that, while a religiously plural society needs a universal political consensus, it should allow plural religious communal beliefs. Now in this section, I shall argue for a reflective equilibrium between the singular political communal idea of the right and the plural religious communal conceptions of the good, together with many background communal beliefs. The relationship between religious ideas of the good and political ideas of the right is a complicated one. One and the same religious world-view can be made coherent with several different and sometimes conflicting political</page><page sequence="14">160 YONG HUANG ideas. For example, while there are orthodox Catholics who hold a pro-life position to regard abortion and homosexuality as sinful, there are also Catho- lics who defend the rights of women to choose in both childbearing and childrearing and who maintain that gay and lesbian Catholics are members of Christ's mystical body and therefore it is their right to participate fully in the sacramental life of the church.39 Similarly, one and the same political idea can be made coherent with several different and sometimes conflicting religious world-views. For example, it has been found that no significant differences exist among Protestants, Catholics, and Jews on many political issues, including capital punishment, tolerance of communists, gun control, interracial marriage, welfare, and defense spending.40 I am aware that these sociological facts have sometimes been interpreted as to indicate that reli- gious significance on social and political issues is declining, general religious preference may be irrelevant to people's attitudes or values, and all that matters is one's political and ideological position. Such an interpretation, however, seems to me inadequate: religious people themselves have never thought that their political ideas can be separated from their religious beliefs. For example, Hunter tells a story about a new convert to Catholicism, which officially condemns homosexuality. This new convert, however, supports homosexuality and does so because of, rather than in spite of, his new belief: Jesus came to offer liberation for anyone who would listen, where "the liber- ation Jesus brings is not a personal liberation from 'sin of homosexuality' . . . but rather the liberation of individuals to live according to the dictates of personal conscience and style, and the liberation of society as a whole from the prejudices and intolerances that keep it from being genuinely free."41 How is this possible? It is important to see that religious beliefs and political convictions are two very different languages. Whether from polit- ical ideas to religious beliefs or the other way round, there are many small steps of faith in Gordon Kaufman's sense. By virtue of these small steps of faith, starting from the same place on one side, either political or religious, different people may land at very different places on the other; because of these small steps of faith, however, starting from one place on one side, one is not free to land anywhere one wishes on the other.42 Religious beliefs and political ideas constitute only a small part of a belief system, which includes many background beliefs, psychological, sociological, scientific, aesthetic, etc. Therefore, although different people may share a religious world- view or a political principle, their different background beliefs may lead them to have very different interpretations of their shared views. To illustrate the steps from the religious world- view to particular beliefs, it is interesting to take a look at Kathryn Tanner's intriguing analysis of the idea of predestination. Tanner convincingly shows that, from the same belief</page><page sequence="15">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 161 in predestination, a whole list of often conflicting practical conclusions can be drawn. For example, one may be led to believe either that "one's final end may bear no resemblance to the life lived" or that good work is "the appropriate consequence of one's selection;" either that one should be humble "for the good works one performs for others as a Christian" or that " 'the ungodly' lives of people whom God has not chosen" should be condemned; either that "moral achievements are not what distinguishes persons in the eyes of God" and therefore the failings displayed by oneself or others should be tolerated or that "rigid behavioral requirements for church membership" are indications of election.43 To illustrate the steps from particular beliefs to a religious world- view, it would be instructive to have a bird's eye view of Gordon Kaufman's grand theological project.44 Kaufman has convincingly argued that his conception of God as the creativity of the ultimate mystery is based on our relatively "settled" conceptions of the human as bio-historical and of the world as evolutionary. However, he emphasizes, there are many "small steps of faith" between these relatively settled particular conceptions to his uniquely Chris- tian conception of God. In other words, from these same largely "settled" conceptions, different people, because of their different background beliefs and life situations, may choose different visions, take different paths toward the vision chosen, and make different turns on the path taken. For example, one may choose to be agnostic rather than metaphysical; one may choose to focus on the structural rather than the creative nature of the metaphys- ical reality; one may choose to understand the creativity as anthropomorphic rather than serendipitous; one may choose to understand this serendipity as by chance rather than as teleological; one may choose to ignore this teleolo- gical serendipitous creativity rather than to commit oneself to it; and finally, one may choose to make this commitment in a non-Christian rather than a Christian context. To argue for a religiously plural society whose members agree on polit- ical principles which are kept in a reflective equilibrium with their different religious world-views, it is also important to remember that the reflective equilibrium among belief systems is always sought, maintained, and remade together with the reflective equilibrium within a belief system. If individuals are asked first to maintain a reflective equilibrium within his or her belief system and only then to achieve a reflective equilibrium with belief systems of others, then it may well be true that there is nothing, political or religious, on which all these belief systems would agree. However, when people with different belief systems have interactions with each other, they often feel compelled to drop some of their previously cherished beliefs out of their belief systems and admit some previously strange-looking beliefs as new</page><page sequence="16">162 YONG HUANG members of their systems. It is in this same process of formulating and refor- mulating their beliefs and configuring and reconfiguring their belief systems that both the reflective equilibrium among belief systems and that within each of them are obtained. Of course, this does not mean that this process will automatically lead to our goal: a political consensus in a reflective equilibrium with plural religious ideas. While people's beliefs, both religious and political, will change, some- times dramatically, through public discourses, this does not mean that the change is always in our favor.45 It is therefore also important to understand that to realize our goal is, to borrow Bruce Ackerman's term, a "pragmatic imperative."46 We have only two options: either (a) a well-ordered society with political principles of universal reach or (b) a chaotic society without any political principles or with conflicting political principles. Now, other things being equal, it is obvious that a well-ordered society is to be preferred. Then we have also two options: either (a) we will have a self-government by reaching an overlapping consensus as the foundation of universal polit- ical principles or (b) a government by others making its political principles according to the will of the powerful (that of the majority in a democratic society and that of the mighty in a non-democratic society). Again, other things being equal, we would prefer the self-government. It is in this sense that to search for a political consensus that can be kept in a reflective equilibrium with diverse religious belief systems is a pragmatic imperative. The importance of this realization lies in its ability to help us bring this goal into reality. The point is that people can come into public discourses with very different purposes. If they simply want to carry out some intellec- tual exercises, or political propaganda, or religious missions, then indeed the desired political communal belief system could hardly emerge. However, if they realize that such a communal belief system is a pragmatic imperative and so bring this realization consciously with them into public discourses, such a communal political belief system may well be established, not despite but because of the fact that people hold very different religious world- views: these diverse religious world- views will then function as extremely rich resources people can draw on in constructing their communal political belief system. The public discourse here is not to discover but to construct the needed political communal belief system, which "will involve change in the world of which I [the discussant] shall be empirically the cause."47 In other words, the reality of a society with political consensus supporting and supported by diverse religious beliefs is a reality to be created and not discovered. It is a reality, to use Kant's distinction, to be understood in practical rather than theoretical reason.48</page><page sequence="17">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 1 63 To say this is of course not to say that it is an easy task, but the task would perhaps become less formidable should we try to avoid the grand universalism many liberals and communitarians share. What they are both interested in is some sweeping general political principles that can be applied to all particular political issues across the board. For example, John Rawls's ideal is basically (1) to collect our settled convictions on such particular political issues as slavery and religious intolerance; (2) to see what general political principle are implied or presupposed by these settled convictions; and finally (3) to apply these general political principles to other particular political issues on which we have no similarly settled convictions yet. An overlapping consensus on such political principles among diverse religious belief systems is indeed difficult to reach. However, instead of such a general political consensus, we could try to search for particular political consensus on particular political issues one by one so that more and more convictions on more and more particular issues can be settled. As Nicholas Wolterstorff has also pointed out recently, the political agreement we aim at in discussions with others is "agreement concerning the particular policy, law, or constitu- tional provision under consideration" and this agreement "need not be based on some set of principles agreed on by all present and future citizens and rich enough to settle all important political issues. Sufficient if each citizen, for his or her own reasons, agrees on the policy today and tomorrow - not for all time."49 For example, today we still have many unsettled and difficult polit- ical issues such as capital punishment, abortion, affirmative action, welfare system, gun control, and physician-assisted suicide, to name just a few. Now if people of very different religious and political backgrounds are asked to form a consensus on a general principle of justice that can be applied to solve all these particular political issues, perhaps they even don't know how to start to do that. The task will certainly become more realistic and easier for them, which of course does not mean that it is an easy task at all, if they are asked to form consensus on these particular issues themselves. At least they know how to get started. Each of them may begin to use whatever reasons they may have, including religious reasons, to convince others that capital punishment, for example, is just or unjust. They may then criticize each other's position, but the criticism is essentially an internal criticism. In other words, they have to study each other's belief system very carefully so that they can use the beliefs they share with their opponents to show why their opponents are wrong on the issue of capital punishment. Of course, motivated by the pragmatic imperative of reaching a moral solution to this issue, each of them must also be ready to give up or change one's own views, religious and political among others, when convinced. Only in this way can their solution to this particular issue,</page><page sequence="18">164 YONG HUANG if found, become a consensus overlapping their different religious beliefs, which may have or have not changed in the very process of their search for the overlapping consensus. Now, when I am here proposing the piecemeal approach, I am not saying that we should entirely ignore the general political principle, which may indeed be helpful in finding particular solutions to particular political issues. However, such general principles have not only to be based on our already reached consensus on some particular political issues but have also to be able to help us reach consensus on other issues to be settled. In other words, even if we can form some general political principle on the basis of our particular consensus, this does not mean that this general principle can therefore trump our different views on the particular political issue to be solved and force a solution upon us.50 To show why it is so, I think that one does not have to go as far as Michael Walzer, who believes that different political issues are essentially different and therefore no general principles that can solve all particular issues actually exist.51 Even if all particular political issues are of the same nature and could be solved by one general political principle, we cannot be sure the general political principle we have at hand is the right one. So my point is that general political principles are useful only if they can help us to form overlapping consensus on particular political issues; and if we could form such consensus without the help of these general political principles, there would indeed be no need for them. Of course, even if we take this piece-meal rather than whole-sale approach, there is still no guarantee for a particular political consensus in a reflective equilibrium with people's different religious ideas of the good after a prolonged conversation among them. Yet even this should not be seen as a complete failure of the public discourse. It is only an indication that no political ideas that have actually been proposed so far by any parties could become the focus of their overlapping consensus and therefore a new set of political ideas are to be constructed. Although people remain in disagreement both politically and religiously after their beliefs, both political and reli- gious, have been mutually influenced, enriched, and to a greater or less extent transformed. In the process of public discourses, these mutually influenced, enriched, and transformed beliefs can serve as the fertile soil on which the needed political consensus may be eventually nurtured. Of course, sometimes important political decisions have to be made before such political consensus among plural religious world- views can be reached, usually with the majority rule in a democratic society. Even this, however, does not mean that public discourses entirely fail. Without them, as John Dewey points out, "majority rule, just as majority rule, is as foolish as its critics charge it with being;" it ceases to be foolish, however, if a majority comes to become a majority</page><page sequence="19">RELIGIOUS GOODNESS AND POLITICAL RIGHTNESS 1 65 after "antecedent debates, modifications of views to meet the opinions of minorities, the relative satisfaction given the latter by the fact that it had a chance and that next time it may be successful in becoming a majority."52 In other words, although our initial search for a political overlapping consensus among diverse religious world-views through public discourses fails for the time being, as also pointed out by Habermas, it is significant both in laying the foundation for us to search for it in the future and in func- tioning as a will-formation process in a democratic society in which majority rules.53 Conclusion As an alternative model to liberalism and communtarianism, I have proposed that religious goodness and political lightness have to be situated in a reflective equilibrium. First of all, people's religious ideas of the good and political ideas of the right are seen as two parts of an individual's belief system, which includes many other beliefs. Neither of them (nor any other belief) is foundational: both should be situated in a reflective equilibrium with each other and with other beliefs in the system through their mutual criticism, enrichment, and transformation; secondly, people's beliefs, whether religious or political or otherwise, are inseparable from beliefs their fellow believers and citizens hold. In other words, they are communal beliefs main- tained in reflective equilibrium among different individuals' belief systems; thirdly, in a religiously plural society, it is necessary to search for a universal political communal conception of the right as the moral foundation of the society's coercive laws and public policies; it is also important to maintain plural religious communal ideas of the good as (among others) the moral sources of people's public as well as private lives; finally, for a well-ordered and moral society, there is a need for a reflective equilibrium between plural communal religious ideas of the good and the universal communal political idea of the right. Such a goal is of course not easy to reach, but as a prag- matic imperative, it is something that requires our whole heart and soul to strive for. This does not mean that, however, once we have obtained such a goal, we should do our best to freeze our belief systems in order to preserve this hard-to-obtain equilibrium. Our beliefs, religious and political as well as many others, and their relationship with each other, both on the individual and communal levels, will continue to change as long as we continue to encounter new problems, enter new ages, and have intercourses with new groups of people. Therefore it should become our constant task to struggle for the ever renewed religious ideas of good and political conceptions of the right in an</page><page sequence="20">166 YONG HUANG ever renewed reflective equilibrium, on which a good and right (and ever better and more right) society is predicated.

Perhaps it is in this sense that John Rawls defines the political state as a closed society: "entry into it is only by birth and exit form it is only by death" (Rawls, Political Liberalism, pp. 40-41). 32. This does not mean that coercion has always to be used. In fact, the less it is used, the better the state will be. In this sense, Wuthnow is right to say that the state is "distinguished less by the actual presence of coercion than by the fact it reserves for itself the right to enforce compliance" (Wuthnow, "The voluntary sector: legacy of the past, hope for the future?', in Wuthnow (ed.), Between States and Markets: The Voluntary Sector in Comparative Perspective, p. 6). 33.

It is interesting to note that, in the Lincoln-Douglas debate at a time when US society was divided between those who thought that slavery is wrong and those who thought that it is right, the essential point that Douglas was making is precisely that the government should not make a decision on that and people should acquiesce with each other regarding that (see Paul Angle, Created Equal?

William James makes the same point when he tries to make a distinction between the reality causing human knowledge and the reality to be created by human practice. To illustrate the latter, he analyzes the reality of love. Love certainly has its reality but not a reality that is to be discovered among but created by those who love (see James, The Will to Believe, New York: Dover Publications, 1956, p. 23). 49.

Michael Walzer makes the similar point with his idea of sphere of justice (see Walzer, Spheres of Justice, 1983); and so does Cass Sunstein's incompletely theorized agreement (see Sunstein, 'Incompletely theorized agreements', Harvard Law Review 108: 1733-1772). 50. This is exactly John Rawls's approach. After he reached the two principles of justice, which according to him are based (at least partially) on our political culture (meaning our consensus on some settled political issues), he argues that a constitutional democracy should only allow those religious views that are not contradictory to these two principles, while others should be regarded as irrational, irreasonable, or simply mad (see Rawls, Political Liberalism, p. 144). 51. Walzer distinguishes among different spheres of justice such as "membership, power, honor, ritual eminence, divine grace, kinship and love, knowledge, wealth, physical security, work and leisure, rewards and punishments, and a host of goods more narrowly and materially conceived - food, shelter, clothing, transportation, medical care, commodi- ties of every sort, and all the odd things (paintings, rare books, postage stamps) that human beings collect" (Walzer, Spheres of Justice, p. 3). In Walzer's view, each of these goods "ought to be distributed for different reasons, in accordance with different procedures, by different agents" (ibid., p. 6). Although a principle of justice that governs one sphere has to be universally applied to everyone, a just principle governing one sphere may turn out to be unjust when applied to distribute goods in another sphere. 52.
