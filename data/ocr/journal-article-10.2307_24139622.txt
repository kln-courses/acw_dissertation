<plain_text><page sequence="1">Downy Woodpecker. Paul McCutcheon Sears. 44 pp. $2.00 Holiday House. New York. 1953. Downy Woodpecker is an account of the life cycle of one of America's most popular birds. It provides valuable ornithological information for youngsters in that it describes the life and activities of the woodpecker through the seasons, and cleverly re lates the bird's experiences with his physical and biological environment. The values for conserva tion are implied but unmistakably present. Word usage and science concept is within the range of understanding of most young children and presented with exceptional clarity. There is evidence of anthropomorphism but it ef fectively heightens the interest of the very young reader.
