<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval and Renaissance Art* by Jacques Schnier A RTISTS have long commented on the similarity between works of art and dreams. But not until the explora tion of the unconscious with the aid of psychoanalysis was the reason for this similarity uncovered and understood. We now know that both these mental constructions consist of combinations of symbols the purpose of which is to ex press unconscious ideas. And with both works of art and dreams the latent meaning cannot be understood until the symbols have been translated back into their unconscious counterparts. But, there are differences, as well, between works of art and dreams. Whereas in dreams there is usually a marked lack of coherence in the continuity, action and arrangement of the symbols, in recognized works of art, whether painting, sculpture or literature, action and symbols are knitted together with aesthetic exactitude resulting in an exquisite composi tion of an apparently impersonal nature and characterized by harmonious, appealing design. Another difference between works of art and dreams comes from the nature of symbols of which they consist. In a dream, many symbols may be highly personal and private—therefore, not readily understood by an observer. The fact that they are personal and intimate may, at times, even cause them to repel the dreamer or a confidant ♦Amplified from a paper read before San Francisco Psychoanalytic Edu cation Society, August 12, I960</page><page sequence="2">90 Jacques Schnier uninitiated in the science of the unconscious. With art, how ever, especially art that is part of a culture complex such as the religious sculpture of the Hindu and medieval European periods, or the church and secular paintings of the Renais sance, the majority of the symbols are highly impersonal, common to the culture as a whole, and are therefore more readily understood by an observer's unconscious. An illustration of such an art symbol is the bird which ap pears in the art of widely separated cultures but with spe cial frequency in Medieval and Gothic sculpture and Re naissance painting. An examination of the context in which this symbol appears and a study of the rationalized mean ings and explanations assigned to it by various cultures helps us to understand its unconscious contents and to verify its meanings as uncovered in other instances in actual psycho analytic practice. Such an examnation also discloses some of the unconscious mental mechanisms operative in the use of this particular symbol. The bird as a symbol was first brought to my attention by an analyzand who recalled a drawing he had made a number of years previously showing a man astride a horse and holding a bird in one hand. Although untrained as an artist he had resorted to art, more or less in an amateurish way, as means of divertisement during a period of mental depression. This depression was varied and at times was so pronounced as to cause his thinking to turn to thoughts of suicide. A rancher by profession, he had spent a good deal of his time with his cowhand employees and a partner, in the out-of-doors, herding cattle or supervising other work in connection with his holdings. His partner, a. man of con siderably more experience and knack at handling cattle, was his idol. He displayed excessive admiration for him and referred to him constantly in his conversation. But a de veloping friendship between his partner and the owner of an adjoining ranch stirred up a disagreement which eventu ally culminated in a dissolution of the partnership. It was this dissolution of the partnership which brought</page><page sequence="3">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 91 about the analyzaxid's depression and occasioned his making the drawing in question. The bird in the rider's hand held such a firm grip in his imagination that, later in analysis, he exerted a great deal of effort to uncover its meaning. The rider he easily identified with himself. His associations to bird led to thoughts of his partner, then to his brother upon whom he was showering kisses and affection. Then by way of innumerable additional associations, he was led beyond his brother to the image of his mother and to thoughts of suckling at her breast. The bird, therefore, in this particular drawing, was a symbol for a child-mother relationship. That the bird is a common symbol in art becomes clear ly evident upon an examination of Medieval and Renais sance painting and sculpture. In Europe, especially France, early in the fourteenth century, carved figures of the Ma donna and Child with a small bird (plate 1) were produced in great numbers. (1) The design motif was also used extensive ly in other art materials such as embroidery, ivory, and colored glass. The production of these icons in great numbers was rather sudden but may well have sprung from earlier figures of a similar nature. The use of a small bird in the hands of the Christ Child may easily be traced back at least to the sev enth decade of the thirteenth century when it began to ap pear in French sculpture and in Italian painting. By the end of the century it had emerged as a vigorous artistic trend and spread with great rapidity throughout the art producing countries of Europe. (2,p.3) As a result of his extensive investigation of this motif Friedmann, an art historian, is led to the conclusion that in the great number of religious paintings produced in Europe between the latter part of the Middle Ages and the late Baroque, probably few accessory symbols occur with great er frequency than the figure of the bird. But unlike the birds appearing in the earlier medieval statues, the species in the paintings is definitely identifiable and of the literally hundreds of compositions in which a bird appears, approxi</page><page sequence="4">92 Jacques Schnier mately seventy-five to eighty percent is of one kind, the goldfinch. (2,p.l) Friedmann lists almost five hundred known religious paintings from early to late Renaissance containing a goldfinch and states this list could easily be ex tended, probably doubled, if one cared merely to amass more cases. If all Renaissance works of art in which a bird of other species appears were to be included, this list would be multiplied many times. The devotional pictures in which the goldfinch occurs are either simple two-figured groups of the Madonna and Child with or without attendants or members of the Holy Family; or special three-figured groups of the Madonna, Child and Infant St. John. Other types of compositions con taining the goldfinch are Nativities, Adoration of the Shep herds or the Magi, Mystic Marriages, Coronation of St. Catherine, or Rest on the Flight into Egypt. The use of the goldfinch in a child's hand was not limited, however, to re ligious paintings. A number of secular children's portraits have come down to us in which the child is playing with such a bird. Examples to mention but a few are Bonzino's portrait of Don Garcia de'Medici (Uffizi Gallery, Florence) (2,pl.l), Titian's group portrait of the children of King Ferdinand I in the Lord Desborough collection, England, Van Dyke's "Child with Bird" in the Kaiser Friedrick Museum, Berlin, and Ruben's painting of his two sons in the Liechtenstein Gallery, in Vienna. Alessandro Allori's portrait of a young man, in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, is a similar example, but with a greenfinch, another favorite but less frequent pet than the goldfinch. 2,pl.2) Upon examining the characteristics of the goldfinch itself, we find that it is one of the brightest plumaged of the small, common, widely distributed birds of Europe. Because of its wide distribution it was as well known during the Renaissance to the town dwellers as to the country folk. This coupled with the fact that it became tame quite readily and seemed not to mind familiar handling made it a favorite household pet. But its role in the household was not exactly that of a common</page><page sequence="5">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 93 cage bird such as the canary is today. Children were often given a live goldfinch on a long string, and would amuse them selves by letting it fly about holding to the other end of the tether to prevent its escaping. These factors, no doubt, con tributed materially to the widespread use of this species of bird, the goldfinch, as a symbol by the people of this particular period. According to Dante one of the objects most longed for by Italian children of his time was a little bird. (3) What was true of Italian children of the great poet's time was true of children of other European countries as well. In the popular beliefs and legends of the middle ages a bird was looked upon as an augur of supernatural power especially in connection with the curing of disease. The early belief of a bird with miraculous curative powers was so well established in superstition that it almost passed for natural history. This legend can be traced in classical sources to a bird called KARADRIOS (charadrius). In order to cure a patient of illness, the charadrius was brought to the person's bedside. If the bird turned its head away from the patient, he would not recover, but if the bird looked at him, it drew the disease out into itself and the patient would recover. A sixth century Greek writer, Hipponax, expressed the belief that jaundice could be transferred to a yellow plover. To rid the jaundiced patient of illness, it was only necessary for him to look at the plover ; as the plover closed its eyes, the illness was supposed to pass over to the bird. The Greeks considered the cure so rapid and effective, that the bird dealers hid this particular bird from their customers until the latter paid, lest they were cured in advance by the bird's glance. (2,p.ll) We know that all popular beliefs and superstitions are only rationalizations in symbolic form which cover deeper ideas. To obtain the true meaning of the bird as a symbol it is necessary to uncover the unconscious thoughts associated with it. A study of the early European works of art in which a bird appears discloses a number of interesting associations which support the interpretations brought out in psycho analytic practice. In by far the greatest number of these</page><page sequence="6">94 Jacques Schnier examples the composition features the Madonna and Child with a bird held in the latter's hand. In some compositions, as for example the "Madonna and Child with a Charadrius" by a follower of Cimabue, in S. Andrea, Mosciano (2,pl.7), the Madonna or an accessory figure offers the bird to the Child. Another arrangement which occurs with some degree of fre quency, shows the bird held in the Child's hand with the latter sticking his finger into the bird's mouth, as we see it in Taddeo di Bartolo's ''Madonna and Child" in the Fogg Museum of Art (plate 4) and in the 14th century French statue in the Los Angeles County Museum (plate 3). Still other paintings, e.g. Francesco Pesellino's "Madonna and Child with Three Angels" in the Toledo Museum of Art, show the Child holding the bird up to his mouth and kissing it (plate 5). One of the instances of a Madonna and Child composition in which the bird seldom appears is the "Madonna Lactans" type which shows the Virgin in the act of nursing the Christ Child. This theme is of great antiquity and derives from the catacomb art of the third century A.D. Although used by artists throughout the early period of European art up to the Boroque, it never attained a numerical abundance com parable with that of the ordinary composition of the Madonna and Child. (2,p.48) In a few compositions of the Madonna Lactans type the. bird does appear either in the Child's hand or in some other place in the design. Examples of such a compositional arrangement are Leonardo da Vinci's "Madon na Litta" in the Hermitage, Leningrad, (2,pl.71) ; Antonio Venziano's Madonna and Child in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and a similar theme by Taddeo Di Bartolo in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. However, in the large majority of compositions of this type the bird is entirely ab sent, and it is this detail that is worthy of special comment. Representations of the Virgin suckling the Child had a particular significance in the thought and consequently art of the late Middle Ages. It showed a situation wherein the Virgin was most concretely and intimately the Mother of</page><page sequence="7">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 95 Christ, thus emphasizing her role as "Marie Mediatrix," the motherly compassionate, intercessor for mankind, before the more impartial, paternal justice of Christ or God the Father. The comparative absence of the bird in compositions of this type is commented upon by Friedmann as follows : "... the goldfinch, aside from being the usual symbol of 'soul' was also a symbol of of special favors (fertility, protection from disease, etc.). We may well ask whether, its scarcity in pic tures of the "Madonna lactans" type may not be, to some extent, a reflection of the thought that in the presence of the supreme general intercessor, a symbol for special favors was considered superfluous and therefore not inserted as a rule. ' ' (2,p.42) For the science of the unconscious, such an explana tion seems to indicate some unconscious insight as to the meaning of this compositional arrangement. But on the basis of our knowledge of the wish-fulfilling nature of art and the information obtained from myths, legends, fairy t tales and analyzands the following interpretation presents itself: One of the situations which the 'child in man' unconsciously longs to recover is the act of being nursed at the mother's breast, a position which was lost upon being weaned. In accordance with the unconscious mechanisms of symbol form ation, the bird, a form commonly experienced by most people, is selected as a representative of the lost and longed for object. Since in the Madonna lactans compositions the child is depicted in actual possession of the lost object, i.e., the mother's breast, it therefore becomes a superfluous gesture, a redundancy, so to speak, to also show the child with the lost object in the form of a bird in its hand. Folk-lore, which we can consider a form of art just as we do folk-music and folk-dancing, makes frequent use of the bird as a symbol of unconscious ideas. In certain tales the identification of the bird with the milk-giving mother is clearly discernible. An African Negro folktale, which revolves about the theme of the 'Bird that made milk' exists in several variants among the Basuto, Kaffir, Zulu, and Bechuana peo ples. In the Basuto version a woman comes into the posses</page><page sequence="8">96 Jacques Schnier sion of a wonderful bird that provides the family with milk. She conceals it carefully in the hut, and every evening it fills as many clay vessels with milk as the family requires. The children discover it, however, play with it, fill themselves with milk, and finally lose it in the forest. They try to recover it but fail. Suddenly a violent storm comes upon them, so violent that the trees are uprooted. But an enormous bird comes and covers the children with its wings so that they are not harmed. When the storm is over the bird carries them off, nurtures them carefully, at the proper time even putting them through their puberty rites, and returns them safe and beautiful to their parents. The joyful villagers then reward the bird with gifts or cattle. (23) Before seeking further support for the preceding inter pretation of the bird as a symbol of motherly attributes, more particularly, the nursing mother, let us turn for a moment to the other accessory objects held either by the Child or the Virgin in the Madonna and Child compositions. Many of these objects are round and ball-like, or are fruit (plate 6), such as apples, bunches of grapes, peaches, figs, etc. — some thing to be eaten. The innumerable carved Madonna and Child statues of the German Gothic period frequently included one of these accessories instead of a bird. (4) All of these objects either because of their characteristic shape or other attributes may readily be accepted by the unconscious as symbols for the mother's breast. An analyzand with a distressing food phobia became violently ill upon biting into or even touching the skin of an unpeeled peach. His associations to peach, led by way of peaches and cream complexion : pink : white : skin : to the skin of his mother's breast which in phantasy he was biting into whenever he ate a peach. M. A. Sechehaye reports the case of a schizophrenic girl who craved apples because unconsciously apples represented her mother's breasts, or mother's milk. Her craving applied especially to green apples because they were still attached to the tree (i.e., represented mother's milk) whereas ripe apples are detached from the tree and therefore represented boiled milk, cow's milk. (5,p.</page><page sequence="9">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 97 49) Referring to this craving, the girl writes in her auto biography: ''Mama (the analyst), tried affectionately to calm me but without success. 'Why,' she said, 'don't you take the apples I bring you?' 'I can't do that, Mama,' I answered. And while in my heart I was outraged that Mama too wanted to force me to eat, my eyes fell to her bosom and when she insisted, 'But why don't you want the apples I buy you'?' I knew what I was yearning for so desperately and was able to bring out, 'Because the apples you buy are food for grown ups and I want real apples, Mama's apples, like those,' and I pointed to Mama's breasts. She got up at once, went to get a magnificent apple, cut a piece and gave it to me, saying, 'Now, Mama is going to feed her little Renee. It is time to drink the good milk from Mama's apples.' She put the piece in my mouth, and with my eyes closed, my head against her breast, I ate, or rather drank, my milk." (6,p.78) The ball with the small cross attached on the top of it, held in the Child's hand is another accessory frequently used in Madonna and Child statues of the Gothic period. (1,fig. 67) The Catholic Church interprets this accessory object as the world and explains its symbolism as meaning that: Christ will go to the cross for the sins of the world and by so doing will redeem humanity and make it triumphant. From our understanding of the personal fantasy factor in all art, we, however, are more inclined to see less altruistic significance in this symbol and to interpret it as a matter of wish-fulfil ment — the round, ball-like world as a symbol of the breast and its important appendage, the cross, as the nipple. When we consider the roundness and softness of birds in general and domesticated fowl (ducks, geese, hens, pigeons, etc.) in particular, we gain further insight as to why they are selected by the unconscious to serve in the category of symbols for the pregenital emotion associated with the mother's breast. In the course of further associations, the analyzand referred to earlier (who made the drawing of a rider with bird), recalled his first hunting experience, at the age of 10, when he killed a bird. Overcome with remorse,</page><page sequence="10">98 Jacques Schnier he decided to preserve it, to accomplish which he took up the intensive study of taxidermy by means of books he ob tained from the public library. Behind this thin veil, of course, was the desire to restore the destroyed object and to permanently possess it. He recalled that in this activity of preserving the bird, the shape of the breast dwarfed all other features into insignificance. For him it was the full, rounded, soft breast which constituted the essence of the bird. Wormhoudt has observed that, "... compared to most animals, birds are not easy to distinguish sexually — differ ences in color being negligible for the child in this respect . . . They come and go with inexplicable suddenness ..." and for the child a similar appearance and disappearance of the breast in accordance with the coming and going of the mother during her daily routine is characteristic of being nursed. (7,p.l3) The comparison of the sudden appearance and dis appearance of birds with the typical coming and going of the mother also suggests an explanation for the popularity among children of the Renaissance of a live bird on a string as a toy. An example of the use of this motif in art is the "Madonna and Child" from the studio of Cosimo Tura (John G. Johnson Art collection, Philadelphia). (2,pl.l26) The use of a tethered bird as a toy was not, of course, limited to the Renaissance period alone. Even today in many towns and cities of China a common street sight is the bird vendor, surrounded by a circle of admiring children, as well as grown ups, intently viewing his display of tethered birds. If the bird symbolizes the mother, the string to which it is tethered as sured the child of control over her return. This interpretation is supported by an observation reported by Freud. It refers to a child who had a wooden reel with a piece of string wound round it which he kept throwing with considerable skill into his little draped cot all the while holding on the end of the string. As the reel disappeared into the cot he uttered a significant 'o-o-o-oh' (which apparently meant 'go away') and then drew the "maternal" reel out of-the cot again greeting its reappearance with a joyful 'Da' (there).</page><page sequence="11">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 99 (8, p.12) A balloon had the same connotation for the 24-year old schizophrenic girl reported by M. A. Sechehaye. Upon .being given the toy, the girl immediately treated it as "an emblem of the maternal breast, which was offered to her not as a necessity but as a pleasure (what one receives when not hungry)". The balloon had a string attached to it, and the girl could pull it toward her as the fancy came. In addition to the balloon, she was given a ball with a rubber string, and on the ball she wrote the word: "Mother." (5,p.76) One of the most common explanations for the bird held in the Christ Child's hand is that of the Soul, or of the spiritual as opposed to the earthly nature. This belief that the soul is winged and in the form of a bird is common to many cultures. Amongst the Bella Coola of British Columbia the soul is considered to dwell in the nape of the neck and to resemble a bird enclosed in an egg. If the shell breaks and the soul flies away, the man dies. If the man swoons or be comes crazed it's because his soul has flown away without breaking the shell.. A shaman can hear the buzzing of wings as the soul flits by and he may catch it and replace it in the owner's neck. (9,p.33) The soul, being thought of as loftier, more aspiring than the body, was also connected with the idea of being winged and so came to be pietorialized in the form of a bird or at least in a form approximating that of a bird. Several religious similies are also based, at least in part, on similar associations. In this connection Jones points out that, "the upward flight of the bird was used to represent the aspiration of a soaring soul, and in the Roman catacombs the idea of such souls being released from sin is depicted by birds escaping from their cages and flying upwards. In the same way the idea of a bird's flight came to represent that of resurrection, i.e. of arising again." (10,p.327) The native Boros of Brazil (9,p.33) as well as the ancient Egyp tians and Greeks conceived the human soul as having the shape of a bird which flew out of the body at death. In the prize winning contemporary Mexican film, "Los Olvidados," (The Forgotton Ones), one of the main characters, a 'dead</page><page sequence="12">100 Jacques Schnier end' kid, is killed by a fellow gangster in a barn. The scene showing the moment of his death is portrayed by a white chick en stepping off his chest. According to Wormhoudt all these concepts pertaining to the flight of the soul probably stem from the "feeling of abandonment and desolation which the child feels when abandoned by the breast." (7,p.l47) It was an early Christian belief that the soul leaves the body at death by way of the mouth. One of the first psychoanalytic studies to direct our attention to the symbolism of the bird is Freud's Leonardo da Vinci. In this study, a considerable portion of the analysis of this famous Renaissance genius is based on the interpreta tion of a childhood memory concerning a bird. Leonardo recorded this memory in a scientific communication dealing with the flight of the vulture. "It seems that it had been destined before that I should occupy myself so thoroughly with the vulture, for it comes to my mind as a very early memory, when I was still in the cradle, a vulture came down to me, opened my mouth with his tail and struck me many times with his tail against my lips." (ll,p.52) Freud points out that the scene of the vulture is completely improbable and therefore could not be a memory but was a fantasy which the artist formed later and transferred to his childhood. -'When this fantasy is examined psychoanalytically we "under stand why Leonardo displaced the memory of the supposed experience with the vulture to the nursing period. This fantasy conceals nothing more or less than a reminiscence of nursing — or being nursed — at the mother's breast, a scene both human and beautiful, which he as well as other artists undertook to depict with the brush in the form of the mother of God and her Child." (ll,p.57) In this interpretation of Leonardo's fantasy we find that the mother is identified with a vulture. Freud proposes the question how does this particular bird come to be used as a symbol of the mother, and then proceeds to attempt an answer based on historical sources. In' the sacred hiero glyphics of the old Egyptians, the mother is depicted by a</page><page sequence="13">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 101 picture of a vulture. "These Egyptians also worshipped a motherly deity, whose head was vulturelike or who had many heads of which at least one or two were that of a vulture. The name of this goddess was pronounced MUT and we may question whether the sound similarity to our word mother (German - Mutter) is only accidental." (ll,p.58) There are also many other associations in early cultures between bird and mother. In classical mythology, love and mother god desses such as Ishtar (deity of war and fertility), Aphrodite, and Diana (huntress and guardian of child-birth) were often portrayed with prominent breasts and "have their totem in the form of a bird — usually a dove." (7,p.l47) Leonardo's phantasy is somewhat paralleled by the dream of a young sheepherder related by the Welsh poet Vaughan, in a letter written in 1694 ; the main difference being that in the latter case, the bird, a hawk, actually entered the dream er's mouth. "I was told by a very sober and knowing person (now dead) that in his time, there was a young lad father and motherless, and soe very poor that he was forced to beg ; butt att last was taken up by a rich man, that kept a great stock of sheep upon the mountains not far from the place where I now dwell, who cloathed him and sent him into the mountains to keep his sheep. There in Summer time following the sheep and looking to their lambs he fell into a deep sleep ; in which he dreamt, that he saw a beautiful young man with a garland of green leafs upon his head, and an hawk upon his fist ; with a quiver full of Arrows att his back, coming towards him (whistling several measures or tunes all the way) and att last lett the hawk fly att him, which (he dreamt) gott into his mouth and inward parts, and suddenly awaked in a great fear and consternation: but possessed with such a vein, or gift of poetrie, that he left the sheep and went about the country, making songs upon all occasions, and came to be the most famous Bard in all the countrey in his time." (10, p.338) Instances of the use of the bird as a female symbol in literature are legion. Both Beres (12,p.lll) and Wormhoudt</page><page sequence="14">102 Jacques Schnier (7,p.32) in their psychoanalytic studies of Coleridge's "The Ancient Mariner" refer to the albatross as a symbol of the mother. Wormhoudt states that in his wanderings there finally appears to the Ancient Mariner, the "chief breast symbol, the albatross (a bird, but not a songbird and thus one that denies sound-milk),. . . . and the mariner, like the expectant infant, places all his hopes in it." According to Beres, Coleridge's choice of the albatross symbol was deter mined by his deep conflict with his mother against whom he harbored unconscious infantile hatred, murderous wishes, and sexual phantasies. "He was aware of a profound sense of guilt from his early youth ... In the Ancient Mariner he indicates the source of his guilt. It is his aggressive, mur derous impulses against an object associated with food and protection. His life story conforms the oral basis of his guilt. There is the preoccupation with food, the never-satisfied searching for love, the attempt to find peace by turning to opium ' '. A child's story which shows the close relationship be tween bird and food was related to me by an eight-year-old boy. His story, which he titled "The Sparrows and the Witch," is as follows: "There was once upon a time a little sparrow. Unlike other birds this little sparrow had a magic spell to turn any enemy of his or the other sparrows into a piece of cheese, no, I mean bird-grain. Then they would eat the enemy cause he was a piece of bird-grain. One day a nasty old witch came. She threw a net over the birds and what do you think happened? She turned into a mouse, into a lion, into an ogre, into a tiger — no, I mean into a horse. Then they got a free ride just for nothing. Then she turned into a witch again and she had another plan. What do you think her plan was? She put out a piece of cheese — no, I mean bird-seed ; then the sparrows came and were eating the piece of cheese — no, bird-seed. Then the witch thought that she would have a nice sparrow souffle for dinner. Then when they got all nice and fat from eating the bird-seed she set up a mouse trap, a special kind of one. She put out some more</page><page sequence="15">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 103 bird-seed right by some bushes. Then she set a bird-trap, — the kind that you use bird-lime with. So the sparrows came for the bird-seed as usual. So all the birds got caught in the bird-lime. Then the old witch took them home in a basket. But as you know the sparrow had the power to turn any of his or his friends' enemies into a mouse. Well just as she was going to cook the sparrow souffle — just before she put the birds into it, he turned the witch into a piece of bird-grain and ate it and that is the end of the story." In this phantasy the child has reversed roles; through the process of identi fication he has become the sparrow himself like the bird in those Madonna and Child compositions into whose mouth the Christ Child inserts his finger. The witch (mother symbol) is equated, among other things, to a piece of cheese (substance closely related to milk) and a bird-grain. Another illustration of the use of bird symbols by an eight-year-old boy was reported to me by Agnes Cummings. This boy, when drawing or doodling, almost always confined himself to bird forms. These forms, which were without much elaboration or individualization had captions which referred to the subject as ''King Bird". Despite the title, the birds seemed to have a uniformly feminine character. Although the child himself volunteered no association as to the identity of his birds, Mrs. Cummings, on the basis of her knowledge of the boy's mother, who was compulsively over protective, ventured the following interpretation: "It would seem that this child saw his mother as just such a constantly hovering bird, a bird as large as the world, controlling not only him, but everyone about him too, and from the shadow of whose wings he could never escape. Moreover, this power ful female creature was phallic at the same time, and was referred to as king rather than queen." (24) One of the concepts of the Christian religion is the Trin ity: Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. For almost six hun dred years artists portrayed the Trinity by certain attributes rather than by anthropomorphic figures; God the Father by a hand, The Son by a cross, and The Holy Ghost by a dove</page><page sequence="16">104 Jacques Schmer or a book. According to St. Luke, ' ' The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a Dove upon Him." (13) A study of Christian art discloses that the dove is the most frequently used bird form of this religion. Hulme states that "Doves of carved wood are frequently found on font covers in our Old English parish churches, and probably in former days no font would have been considered duly complete without such a symbol of the sacramental rite, of the presence of the Holy Spirit in it . . . The three scenes (aside from the Holy Trinity itself) in which the figure most freely occurs are' representations of the baptism of Christ, the annunciation of the Virgin, and the Creation of the World." (14,p.l84) In representations of the Holy Trinity, the Holy Dove often hovers between the Father and Son and sometimes the tip of each wing seems to touch the mouth of each. The color generally used in representing the Bird is the purest and most dazzling white. The beak and claws are mostly red, but some times are painted golden. The nimbus or halo surrounding it is of a golden yellow or gold to represent rays of light. When the Dove is made of metal, it is either of gold, silver or copper covered with the most brilliant enamel and set with precious stones. There is much evidence to support the idea that even the bird of various species appearing in the Madonna and Child compositions, either in the Child's hand, on a tether or else where is interchangeable with the Holy Dove. Significant in this respect is the fact that in many of the earliest devo tional paintings in which the Christ Child holds or reaches for a bird, the latter is pure white, the usual color for repre senting the Holy Dove. For example, the thirteenth century Florentine painting by a follower of Cimabue in the Parish Church at Mosciano, shows a fairly sizable whitish bird, large enough to be a dove, but without a nimbus, in the Virgin's left hand, towards which the Infant Savior stretches out His hands. (2,pl.7) In other instances the white bird is clearly identifiable as a dove. Friedmann lists the following examples of the use of a white dove in the Madonna and Child composi</page><page sequence="17">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 105 tions: a painting by Piero di Cosimo, in the Louvre, Paris; a picture including St. Catherine and Michael Spavanti by Paolo Veronese (S. Sebastien, Venice) in which St. Catherine offers the Christ Child a white dove ; and two paintings of "The Holy Family with a Dove," one by Rubens (W. H. Moore Collection, New York) and the other by Fragonard. Regarding this type of composition, a Russian writer Konda kov writes: "Purely Russian icons of this theme show a white goldfinch or some sort of white bird instead of a finch, and there follows the interpretation that it is a white dove, and a halo around it marks it as the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove. .". (2,p.ll6) Although the meaning of the Holy Ghost (Holy Dove) has been rationalized by religious writers for almost two thou sand years, its identity remains the most enigmatical of the three persons for those unacquainted with the unconscious meaning of symbols. As one author on Christian Symbolism admitted, "Our ideas in representing this incomprehensible mystery are necessarily so imperfect that there is very little choice to be made as to which is the least inadequate." (15,p.44) One of the earliest psychoanalytic attempts to interpret the meaning of the Holy Dove is contained in Jones' richly documented investigation of "The Madonna's Concep tion Through the Ear." In this investigation Jones is pre occupied with substantiating his interpretation of the Holy Dove as the phallus impregnating the Virgin with its Holy breath. But notwithstanding his chief concern with a single interpretation of this symbol, Jones does comment on the opposite attributes of the Dove and states, " (the) peculiar tenderness in the love making of doves is to be correlated with a feature in the associations surrounding the idea of them on which I have only lightly touched — namely, femin inity. It would lead too far to enumerate instances of this association, but it is a curiously extensive one, so that one is forced to say that of all phallic emblems the dove is one of the most gentle and effeminate." (10,p.341) Now in addition to the above observations (suggestive of the feminine nature</page><page sequence="18">106 Jacques Schnier of the dove symbol) there are numerous associations in re ligious writings and art which justify a psychoanalytic inter pretation of the Holy Dove, for these specific contexts, as another symbol of the mother. For example: the typical description of a conversion to Christianity is, "reborn of the Holy Ghost. ' ' And Jones has noted in his study of the Holy Ghost, "Not only must the Mother logically constitute the third member of any Trinity whose two other members are Father and Son, not only is this so in all the numerous Trini ties known to us, but there is a considerable amount of direct evidence indicating that this was originally so in the Chris tian myth itself. . . . The original Mother, who was accepted by for instance the Ophitic sect as the third member of the Trinity would appear to have been of mixed Babylonian and Egyptian origin, although there are not wanting indications to show that a misty Mother-figure floated in the background of Hebrew theology also. Thus the passage in Genesis (i. 2) 'And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters' should properly run 'The Mother of the Gods brooded (or fluttered) over the abyss and brought forth life,' a bird-like conception of the Mother which must remind us not only of the Holy Dove (i.e. the Holy Spirit that replaces the Mother), but also of the legend that Isis conceived Horus while flutter ing in the shape of a hawk over the dead body of Osiris." (10,p.417) In support of the female significance of the Holy Dove Roheim points out that "in the Semitic world the idea of the dove is associated with the belief in Ishtar or similar mother-goddesses representing love both in its tender and in its unbridled, incestuous aspect. Ishtar is the virgin mother and . also the prostitute. . . . The inhabitants of the harem, i.e. the virgins consecrated to the Ishtar cult, are referred to as 'birds(/w)&gt;a euphemistic expression for prostitutes, or more especially as ' doves '(tu Am) and their habitations are dovecots" (25,p. 161) In addition to its soft round form there are other factors that contribute, no doubt, to the use of the dove to uncon sciously symbolize the mother. An important feature relating</page><page sequence="19">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 107 to doves is the tenderness they display in their mating-rela tions, and as Jones observes, "This tenderness manifests it self in a very prominent characteristic of doves — namely, the soft, delightful cooing that plays a leading part in their love-making." (10,p.341) The child, of course, first expe riences sounds comparable to the 'cooing of turtle-doves' in his relationship to his mother. In other instances, pleasing sounds are associated with the act of suckling itself so that in the unconscious, sounds in the form of words, poetry or music might easily be equated to suckling activities as well as to the pleasure-giving milk. Ella Sharpe reports the analysis of a singer who in associating to her own voice says, "The voice pours out like water, like cream. . . You are a bird flying up in your voiee. It draws people to you. They feel as you feel, sad or gay. The Pied Piper drew children from their homes with music. Orpheus drew stocks and stones. The Sirens (bird-like numphs) drew men to destruc tion." (16) Freddy, the author of the ''Sparrows and the Witch" story, upon hearing milk being poured into a glass, commented, "Just hearing it, looks good." When asked why he thought the milk looks good, he explained that what he meant to say was, "Just hearing it, tastes good," i. e., it sounds as good as it tastes. These associations disclose an interesting and significant aural-scoptiphilia-oral relationship in the unconscious mind, and support the interpretation of the bird as the mother also on the bases of the associations: bird: song: sound: suckling relationship. Little Freddy's associations of milk (breast) with sounds recalls Wormhoudt's comments, in his study of The Uncon scious Bird Symbol in Literature, that, "... the most interesting connections between bird and breast in antiquity are those which associated winged creatures with the poets' power to produce words. . . The description of the Muses, for example, included the fact that they were winged (and female). These mother symbols . . . were the tutelary deities of springs from which they gave the poets the inspiring draft which resulted in poetry." (17,p.l75) Birds were also, accord</page><page sequence="20">108 Jacques Schnier ing to Wormhoudt "... the most frequent symbols for the breast in Romantic literature. Their importance for poets, he attributes to the "fact that birds are among the few species of animals which express their emotions in compulsive song—a valuable detail in the unconscious symbolization of the identification words-milk." (7,p.l3) The relationship of words (sounds) with birds is also found in Renaissance painting. In a number of compositions of this period a bird, most frequently a goldfinch, is found near or directly in contact with a small scroll or piece of paper on which a variety of legends is inscribed. Friedmann states, ' ' The fact that there is no basic similarity in the word ings on these scrolls indicates that it is not the message that is compositionally or symbolically related to the bird, but the scroll itself." (2,p.ll8) But the association of scroll with words is practically inseparable even on a conscious level, thus it would appear that what is unconsciously implied in this accessory, in its connection with the bird, is the word: sound: suckling relationship, with bird: song: sound; suckl ing: breast, or, in other words, that these two symbols, in these instances, are identical. The fact that ' ' the goldfinch is, to some extent a substitute object for the little scroll or scroll box usually held by the Christ Child in early pictures done under Byzantine influence" (2,p.ll8) clearly supports the interpretation of the scroll as the mother. In an early Pisan picture by Turino Vanni the Second (Louvre, Paris) ('2,pi. 133) both the scroll and the bird are held in the Christ Child's hand. In Zaganelli's "Virgin Adoring the Child" (Metro politan Museum of Art) the goldfinch actually holds a scroll in its bill (plate 7). Even the arrangement of the Child with a goldfinch in his left hand and a scroll in his right has been used by some artists as is seen in Lippo Memmi's "Madonna and Child" (Servite Church, Siena) and Niccolo da Voltri's "Madonna and Child" in Genoa (Sta. Maria delle Vigne). (2,p.ll9) The book, another object related to words and sounds is also used as an accessory in many Madonna and Child paint</page><page sequence="21">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 109 ings, either by itself or in conjunction with a bird. In Juan de Juanes, "Madonna Enthroned With Saints" (Johnson Art Collection, Baltimore) the child holds a goldfinch in one hand, while the other hand rests upon an open book (plate 8). Piero Di Cosimo, in his version of "Madonna Adoring Child" (Toledo Museum of Art) placed a bird on the left side of the sleeping Christ Child and an open book on its right side, from which the Madonna apparently reads with great emotion. (2,pl.ll) The interchangeableness of bird and book is vividly portrayed in Raphael's series of drawings for his "Madonna del Cardellino" (Ufflzi Gallery, Florence). (2,pl.ll7) The studies for this picture, painted as a wedding gift from the artist to his friend Lorenzo Nazi, have been preserved, and Müntz writes of them as follows : ' ' There is no trace of effort in this picture and yet the artist must have bestowed much thought upon the grouping, which seems so elegant and so unstudied. Four drawings . . . preserved at Oxford and at Vienna, and another in the Wicar collection, not to mention those which have been lost show us the phases through which the composition passed before reaching its pictorial stage. In the first study (Albertina, Vienna) the Virgin in a sitting position, is intent upon a book she has in her right hand, while her left is carelessly rested upon the body of her Child, who is standing up and trying to reach the book as if to divert her attention. The infant St. John is wanting, but in the second study (Oxford) the artist takes a step forward, as there are three figures in the composition. But the main idea of the scene is different again, for the Virgin is reading a book, both the divine infant and St. John listening attentively ... In the interval Raphael made up his mind to work into this scene a motive which he had treated before ; that of St. John pre senting to his companion the bird he has just caught. Each of the succeeding designs mark a further advance, viz. the substitution of the goldfinch for the book, which is transferred to the Virgin's left hand . . . " (18) These associations of the book and bird recall the fact that a book as well as a dove are common symbols for the Holy Ghost in. early Christian</page><page sequence="22">110 Jacques Schnier art; they also suggest the following set of additional associa tions : Scroll: words: sounds: ) ) book: words: sounds: ) ) suckling at mother's bird: song: sounds: ) breast. ) bird: roundness: breast: ) ) bird : flying hither and yon : ) coming and going of mother : ) References have already been made to the ancient belief in the effiicacy of birds for the curing of physical diseases. We now know that many of these diseases like goiter, gastric ulcer, tics, certain forms of hypertension, headaches and neuralgia, etc., (just to mention a few), the etiology of which in the past was unknown, have a definite origin in the emo tional life of the individual concerned. Of these diseases, a large percentage, no doubt, are due to the unconscious strands of a child-mother relationship. Now it is the mother who most frequently comforts and consoles the sick child and in many cases it is the comfort resulting from suckling alone that brings about the cure (perhaps milk was the first great medi cine of mankind). It is conceivable, therefore, that the Charadrius of prechristian and medieval times was primarily a female symbol which in phantasy represented a re-establish ment with the nursing mother of childhood days. In addition to the death episode in 'Los Olividados' mentioned above, a bird also appears in a sick-room scene where a blind old man attempts to cure a sick woman by passing a white dove over her body. In early and medieval Christian art the eagle as well as the dove was a symbol of the Holy Ghost, the eagle being so used ehiefly with characters from the Old Testament. In Hebrew it was a symbol of the spirit. If the Holy Ghost, ac cording to our interpretation, represents the mother, the use</page><page sequence="23">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 111 of such an aggressive and predatory bird as the eagle for her symbol calls for psychoanalytic explanation. Such an explan ation can be found in our knowledge of the child's tendency to project its own aggressive and destructive wishes caused by weaning, on to its mother and then to conceive of her as being cruel, sadistic and providing milk that was poisonous. In such situations she may be symbolized as some ferocious, man devouring animal, as for example a female dragon as I have reported in an earlier communication (19), a female (grand mother) wolf as in ''Little Red Riding Hood," or an eagle. A trait commonly attributed to eagles is that of carrying off children in their talons and then devouring them. The inter pretation of the eagle as a symbol of the mother might help to explain the symbolism of the falcon, another bird that fre quently appears in Renaissance art, especially in portraits of noblemen. These birds were trained to capture non-aggres sive game such as grouse, pheasants, quail and ducks while in flight. Their training was based almost entirely on a careful feeding technique. Although falconry was an es tablished method of hunting of the period, the interest in this method might well be interpreted symbolically just as was the tame goldfinch on a tether used as a toy by children of the same period. An example of a composition including a falcon is Hans Holbein's famous portrait of Robert Chese man, member of the court of Henry VIII. Titian also featured a falcon in his portrait of Georgio Cornaro (known as "The Man with the Falcon"). (20) It is highly significant that in the Titian painting one hand of the subject supports the falcon while the other cups or feels the bird's breast. In the Holbein painting, one hand of the nobleman also supplies a perch for the falcon while the other hand reaches out appar ently in the act of stroking, feeling or holding the breast of the bird. Another instance of an aggressive bird-like creature in a female role is the Harpy. In classical myths, these fabulous creatures are represented as having a woman's head and upper body, and a bird's wings, tail, legs and claws. The Harpies</page><page sequence="24">112 Jacques Schmier are usually malign creatures who snatch up and carry off the souls of the dead or execute divine vengeance by seizing or defiling the food of their victim. In the monument of the Harpies from the tomb of Xanthos in Lycie (now in the Brit ish Museum), there is depicted a flying Harpy with a child in the suckling position in her arms and with her talons clutching onto the child's lower limbs. (21) In this connection it is interesting to note that the word harpy comes from a Greek root meaning — to snatch, to seize. In a dream of a young man, an analyzand of Mrs. Cum mings, some birds played a rather aggressive part. In relat ing the dream he described how these birds darted at his face and swooped on him, 'just the way they do when you are walking down the street in reality'. He insisted it had hap pened to him many times, was in fact a very familiar occur rence, but was unable to recall any single time or identify any incidental action or circumstance. In the end he concluded that there was, indeed, something familiar about the idea, but that it was not the event itself. Later material confirmed the impression that the birds in the dream represented the in fantile image of the phallic mother endowed with the young man's own unconscious aggressive impulses which he had pro jected upon her as a child. It was significant that the young man had the dream several months after the beginning of treatment while still filled with deep sympathy for his poor mother whom he was fond of declaring would not hurt a fly. (24) In some languages the bird is associated with the sexual act or with the male organ. Freud brought attention to the fact that the Italians call the penis 'I'ucello' which is their word for bird; that in Germany the sexual act is popularly designated by the verb 'to bird' (vögeln) ; and that the ancients sometimes depicted the phallus with wings. He ex plained the use of the bird as a phallic symbol on the basis of the wish to fly. This wish to fly which is so common in dreams signifies the longing for sexual accomplishment. Jones (10,p.321) cites many examples from religion, anthropology,</page><page sequence="25">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 113 folk-lore and fairy-tales supporting the interpretation of the bird as a phallic symbol in certain contexts. But there are strong unconscious ties between penis, bird and breast. In certain situations the penis is actually a symbol of the maternal nipple. Freddy, whose associations of sounds with milk have been referred to above, was leaning against his mother's breast one day when he was 5*4 years old. ''Can you feel with your breast, mummy" he asked, and upon receiving the answer, "Yes", he added. "It stands up straight like a winkee. Right up straight!" The identification of nipple with penis stems not only from the similarity in shape but may also originate in children's observations of the nursing processes of certain four legged animals, e.g. the cow. When the child observes the udder or teat of a cow, which in function is a breast nip ple, but which in shape and position on the abdomen resembles a penis, the identification of penis with nipple receives addi tional reinforcement (Freud). According to Wormhoudt, "It seems probable that the child first symbolizes the penis with the bird and then transfers this symbol to the uncon scious breast image. At the time of the child's earliest experience with the breast it is not likely to have much experience with birds. This only comes later, as does his experience of the erectile power of the penis." (17,p.l73) A dream of an analyzand in which the bird was employed both as a symbol of the penis and the breast (something to eat) is reported by Henry Allen Bunker. The analyzand was " 'riding as a passenger in what used to be called the tonneau of an automobile, when a dickeybird flew in the rear window. It began to sing in two parts. Its name was Amelia.' The dreamer's association to 'Dickeybird' were 'dickey, dick' after which he added the question, 'Isn't that a slang word for penis?' In associating to the sentence — 'It then began to sing in two parts', the analyzand, who was a musicologist, said, 'an impossibility of course — you can't sing in two parts any more than you can play a chord on a flute,' and added 'being both masculine and feminine at the same time. I'd</page><page sequence="26">114 Jacques Schnier love to be able to do it; but we have a lot of collateral evi dence also that 'two' may refer to the breasts.' To the dickey bird's name 'Amaleia' his instant association was 'A meal,' to which he added 'The bird comes in and its a meal' (22) A point has now been reached in this study of the bird symbol where we can attempt the interpretation of an addi tional feature to be found in certain Madonna and Child compositions of the Renaissance. In these compositions the Child is being offered a bird, not by his mother, but by a male figure. Examples of paintings in which this feature occurs are: "Madonna and Child" by Francisco de Zurbaran (Fine Arts Gallery, San Diego, Calif.), in which St. John offers the Child a bird (2,pl.21) ; a similar theme by Raphael (Ufflzi Gallery, Florence) (2,pl.ll7) ; and a painting of the School of Cimabue (Sterbini Collection, Rome) in which an old man holds a bird up to the Child (2,pl.34). It is interest ing to note that in another painting by Raphael, '' The Virgin in the Meadow" (Hofmuseum, Vienna), St. John offers the Child a long thin cross-like staff. In these paintings it is conceivable that the bird plays a double role as symbol of the nipple: first as a representation of the maternal breast and secondly, by way of being a symbol of the male organ. This double role of the bird symbol was clearly revealed in the analysis of the bird in the drawing by the analyzand re ferred to earlier. Associating to his brother (of whom he was reminded by the bird) and upon whom he was showering kisses and affection, his thoughts led to performing fellatio on him. This information he took without offence or strong denial but felt that there was something behind the thought that was more deeply repressed. Eventually his associations which had started with 'bird' led him to think of his mother and then of nursing at her breast. But this discovery also disclosed to him how many of the strong male friendships he was inclined to make were motivated by the strong unconscious desire to recover the blissful days of his childhood. In male acquaintances of a certain type he unconsciously saw his brother who had replaced him in his mother's lap, and who,</page><page sequence="27">The Symbolic Bird in Medieval 115 in fantasy, still possessed the longed for object now symbolized by the male organ. 1637 Taylor Street San Francisco 11, Calif.</page><page sequence="28">116 Jacques Schnier REFERENCES 1.
