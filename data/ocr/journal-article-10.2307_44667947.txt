ABSTRACT This study presents an efficient method for accident reconstructionists to determine the expected forward head displacements of automobile occupants who are restrained by lap and torso seat belts during frontal impacts. Data were referenced from various research investigations; thus, a wide range of different test condi- tions, configurations and subjects were considered. The impact severity of the tests ranged from 16 to 60 km/h. Results presented in this study provide a practical method to determine the expected head excursion for occupants who are restrained by lap and torso seat belts during frontal impacts. INTRODUCTION Current techniques for evaluating the expected head excursion resulting from collisions include mathematical occupant simulation models; however, it is often impracti- cal to apply these methods to accident reconstruction. Various mathematical occupant simulation models exist for automotive safety applications; these computer based models may be divided into two sub-groups: • "Gross-motion Simulators", which are based on rigid body linkage analyses. • Finite element analysis impact models. The mathematical simulation models include MVMA2D, MADYMO 2D/3D, CAL3D, UCIN3D, and SOMLA. A review of some of the mathematical models was con- ducted by Prasad, et al. [1], Generally, a good correlation has been demonstrated between test results and simula- tions. James, et al. [2] assessed the limitations of one computer simulation as an accident reconstruction tool; it was suggested that computer simulations are most suit- able for design purposes. Due to the lack of data avail- able from real world accidents, computer modeling to simulate distinct real world accidents may be difficult. Although improved graphical interfaces ease the prepara- tion of computer simulations [3], validation of individual results remains difficult. These methods provide precise results for specific configurations, but unknowns in the incident circumstances immediately preceding the impact may negate the accuracy of the simulations. In addition, time and economic constraints may not yet permit the widespread application of computer simulation models for accident reconstruction. This study provides a time and cost effective generalized method to determine the expected head excursions of automobile occupants who are restrained by three-point seat belt assemblies during frontal collisions. Although the source material for this study is limited to empirical data collected using test subjects, the referenced data consider a wide range of initial conditions and parame- ters such that the results may be confidently applied to real world collisions. These results can also be applied to the assessment of seat belt use by occupants involved in frontal motor vehicle collisions. BACKGROUND One of the primary objectives of the reconstruction of many motor vehicle accidents is to determine the impact speed and the corresponding speed change experienced by the vehicles involved. If the investigation requires the technical assessment of seat belt usage and the benefits of a properly worn seat belt, determination of the expected restrained occupant motion is required. Although occupant kinematic data exists for specific test conditions, there is a need for a comprehensive model considering occupant dynamics for various impact condi- tions. Since it is common for the severity of motor vehicle accidents to be quantified in terms of the speed change experienced by the vehicles involved, it would be most beneficial to express the forward displacement of a restrained occupant with respect to the impact speed change experienced by the vehicle. REVIEW OF LITERATURE The most complete method of determining forward dis- placement for restrained occupants would be to conduct extensive crash simulations with randomly selected human subjects. This is not feasible due to ethical and 771</page><page sequence="2">economie limitations; therefore, data from previous tests that are presented in published literature [4 to 17, 19 to 21] were reviewed and amalgamated for the purpose of this study. Patrick, et al. [4] used a modified automotive seat mounted on a sled to conduct impact tests with an Alder- son Model F50-AU 50th percentile anthropometric test device (ATD). The ATD was restrained by a fixed lap and torso seat belt for test impact speeds of 16 km/h and 32 km/h. The forward and downward displacement of the center of mass of the subject's head were presented in tabular form. It was shown that the maximum forward dis- placement occurred when approximately half of the downward motion was complete. Patrick, et al. also con- ducted tests with unrestrained subjects. For the unre- strained case, the occupants' heads experienced only slight downward displacement with a large forward dis- placement. Chandler, et al. [5] conducted a series of crash simula- tions which included human subjects restrained by fixed lap and torso seat belts. The test subjects consisted of male U.S. Air Force personnel who ranged in age from 20 to 32 years. The test subjects represented a wide range of anthropometric sizes and were required to meet physi- cal qualifications to ensure good spinal, skeletal and neu- rological health. The test apparatus consisted of a decelerator sled device that was configured with an impact velocity of about 24 km/h at a peak deceleration rate of about 12g. The sled was fitted with a bucket seat and restraint system in a geometry similar to a production 1 968 automobile. The data collected by Chandler, et al. included the mean value of the maximum forward displacement of the center of mass of the subject's head. The displacement of each subject was provided in graphical form, with the corre- sponding impact speed indicated. The impact tests yielded varying displacements and trajectory paths for the different subjects. It was observed that some subjects experienced the maximum forward head excursion near the end of downward motion, while other subjects had the maximum forward head motion occur near the middle of the downward displacement. Chandler, et al. observed no correlation between the size or mass of the test sub- ject and the forward head displacement. Herbert, et al. [6] conducted crash simulations to map the head displacement of test subjects belted with a retract- able lap and torso seat belt. The tests employed an Ogle- MIRA M50/71 ATD modified with a stacked ball joint neck from a Sierra 1050 ATD. An open test rig was fitted with production-type cushioned bucket seats and lap and torso retractable seat belts. The frontal impacts were conducted with an impact velocity range of 1 9 to 22 km/h and a peak deceleration rate of about 14g. The peak for- ward, downward and lateral head excursions were tabu- lated. Tests were also conducted using fixed seat belt assemblies and a hard seat; this alternate test configura- tion was found to slightly increase the forward excursion of the test subjects. Hontschik, et al. [7] investigated the kinematics of ATDs restrained by a fixed lap and torso seat belt. The tests were conducted on a sled with an impact speed of 50 km/h. Three types of test subjects were used: a 5th per- centile Sierra female ATD, a 50th percentile Sierra Hybrid II/572 male ATD, and a 95th percentile Sierra male ATD. The maximum forward displacement of the head was provided for some of the conducted tests. It was inferred from the positioning of visual locators that the forward displacement was recorded with respect to the center of mass of the test subject's head. The pro- vided forward displacement values were used to cali- brate a scale from the provided test plots; the corresponding vertical and total head excursions were then extrapolated from these plots. It was observed that the maximum forward head displacement occurred slightly before the maximum downward displacement occurred. Limited data were presented for the 5th per- centile female subject; the available data suggest that notable displacement of the knees occurred without sig- nificant head displacement. This motion is consistent with "submarining", which typically results in unique occupant trajectories and injury patterns. Thus, data for test subjects suspected of submarining were not refer- enced for this study. Hontschik, et al. noted that the seat belt geometry signifi- cantly influences the restraint capabilities of the seat belt and the forward displacement of the test subject. The seat belt geometry was dependent on the belt anchorage points, the occupant size and seating position, the seat stiffness and the initial belt slack. The location of the upper anchorage point for the torso belt had the greatest influence on the forward displacement of the upper body. Hontschik, et al. conducted additional tests with the upper anchorage point of the torso shifted rearward and upward as compared to the "standard" configuration. It was noted that the forward displacement of the occupant increased as the upper anchorage point was shifted rear- ward; however, this increased forward displacement reduced the potential of the occupant to slip out of the belt. Tests were also conducted that varied the two lower anchorage points of the lap portion of the seat belt. It was found that if the lower anchorage points were located approximately 50 cm behind the hip pivot point, the lap portion would slip over the occupant's iliac crest and compress the abdominal region in a motion consistent with submarining. When the lower anchorage points were positioned approximately 10 cm behind the hip pivot point, submaring effects were not observed by Hontschik, et al. The standard test configuration had the lower anchorage points about 30 cm behind the hip pivot point. Walsh, et al. [8] performed barrier crash simulations at speed changes of 54 km/h, 64 km/h and 72 km/h. The tests utilized ATDs of varying stature restrained by lap and torso seat belt assemblies with a range of character- istics; however, the only provided test data were for the 50th percentile ATD involved in a 54 km/h sled impact 772</page><page sequence="3">with a peak deceleration of about 33g. The referenced data consider an ATD that was restrained with a nylon webbing lap and torso seat belt assembly with no pre- load or force limiting device. Although Walsh, et al. con- ducted experiments with different webbing types, force limiting and pre-load devices, only data for the standard configuration emergency locking retractor (ELR) seat belt were referenced. Walsh, et al. noted that the measured head displacement in the forward direction did not signifi- cantly differ with the different seat belt components and configurations. It was found that maximum forward head displacement occurred when approximately 2/3 of the downward displacement was complete. Viano, et al. [9] used a decelerator sled at a velocity of about 35 km/h and a peak deceleration of about 10g. An automotive bucket seat and a fixed lap and torso seat belt restraint system were mounted on the sled. Five centime- ter wide polyester seat belt webbing was used. The test subject was a Part 572 ATD, adjusted with a joint stiffness set at 1g. Tests were conducted with increasing amounts of belt slack. Although the forward head excursion was found to increase dramatically for large amounts of web- bing slack, the increase in forward head excursion was minimal with reasonable amounts of webbing slack. Only the results from testing without belt slack were consid- ered for this analysis. It was observed that the maximum forward head displacement occurred near the end of the maximum downward displacement when minimal slack was available. Viano, et al. [10] conducted another set of sled impact tests using a Part 572 ATD with the joint stiffness set to 1g. The tests considered a velocity range of 17 to 34 km/h at a deceleration of 6 to 16g. An automobile bucket seat and a fixed lap and torso seat belt were installed on the sled apparatus. A set of tests were conducted with a standard Part 572 ATD and another set of tests used a Part 572 ATD with a modified steel sternum. Viano, et al. stated that the two ATD variants produced similar maxi- mum head displacements for tests of comparable sever- ity. The resultant head excursion for each test was listed in tabular form. It was assumed that the resultant head excursion referenced by Viano, et al. represented the maximum total displacement of the center of mass of the test subject's head. Kallieris, et al. [11] studied frontal impact kinematics using fresh cadavers and Part 572 ATD's in a series of tests. The impact sled was configured to simulate a Volvo 240 automobile impacting a barrier at 50 km/h. By refer- encing a plot of the sled pulse from one of the tests, it was calculated that the corresponding speed change of this test was about 56 km/h with a peak deceleration of about 27g. It was assumed that all the Kallieris, et al. tests were conducted with similar deceleration character- istics; thus, the speed change was assumed to have been about 56 km/h for all the Kallieris, et al. tests. The cadavers ranged in size and stature from a mass of 48 kg to 93 kg and a height of 1 .57 meters to 2.0 meters. Kalli- eris, et al. noted that the greatest head excursions were experienced by the lightest and heaviest subjects, which also corresponded to the shortest and tallest subjects, respectively. Saul, et al. [12] simulated fixed barrier impacts with a Hyge sled; the corresponding speed change was recorded to have been about 52 km/h. A Volvo 244 front seat and a 3-point retractable seat belt assembly was used (similar to the Kallieris, et al. test configuration). The Hyge sled was implemented with a half-sine pulse which had a peak deceleration of about 21 g. Hybrid III, Part 572 and the Association of Peugeot-Renault 1 981 ATDs were used in the tests; however, only the Part 572 ATD head displacement data were provided. Igarashi, et al. [13] compared the simulation of 3-point restrained occupant dynamics in frontal impacts with experimental results obtained from sled tests. A Hybrid III ATD was employed in sled tests and frontal barrier tests with an impact speed of about 48 km/h and a maximum deceleration of about 25g and 30g, respectively. The ATD was restrained by a lap and torso seat belt and posi- tioned as a vehicle passenger. It was stated that the test results were in relatively good agreement with the stan- dard simulation model; thus, the standard model results were referenced. The ATD head displacement was pro- vided in graphical form. It was shown that the maximum forward head displacement occurred just prior to the maximum downward displacement. Adomeit, et al. [14] studied the performance of pre- loaded and web-clamp systems on emergency locking retractor (ELR) seat belt assemblies using 50th percentile Part 572 ATD's. Crash tests were conducted on a Bendix- sled system at a reported speed of 48 km/h and a peak deceleration of about 39g. By referencing the provided sled pulse plot, the speed change experienced by the sled was determined to have been about 51 km/h. The maximum ATD head displacement was also given for web-clamp and pyrotechnically pre-loaded ELR systems. It was reported that although the head and hip displace- ment for the web-clamp system test were greater than those for the pre-loaded ELR test, the chest displace- ment for the web-clamp system test was less than the chest displacement for the pre-loaded ELR test. Shimanura, et al. [15] studied restrained occupant kine- matics by conducting a series of sled tests. The tests considered a Hybrid II ATD restrained by a lap and torso retractable seat belt assembly. The sled impact velocity ranged from 48 km/h to 56 km/h. Shimanura, et al. ana- lyzed the head displacement and decelerations of the head and chest. It was observed that maximum head dis- placement most often occurred some time interval after the webbing recorded a maximum tension. It was also found that during seat belt loading, the webbing at the inner D-ring interacted with the D-ring such that only a small amount of slippage occurred. It was thus proposed by Shimanura, et al. that the torso and lap portions of the seat belt assembly should be considered independent of one another. Displacement results of the Shimanura sled tests were provided in graphical form. 773</page><page sequence="4">Stucki, et al. [16] conducted sled tests configured to mimic a production 1 981 Plymouth Reliant. The 56 km/h frontal barrier test was simulated using a sled test with a 59 km/h speed change. The tests utilized a Part 572 ATD restrained by a retractable lap and torso seat belt. The seat belt characteristics were modified for different tests; however, only the test that considered a standard belt and seat was referenced. Freeman, et al. [17] used a Hyge sled mounted with a production seat and lap and torso seat belt assembly. It was used to determine 3-dimensional occupant dynam- ics in a 48 km/h frontal impact. Both Hybrid II and Hybrid III ATD's were used as test subjects in impacts with a 52 km/h speed change. Freeman, et al. found that the upright posture of the Hybrid II allowed greater rotation of the upper body around the torso portion of the seat belt as compared to the Hybrid III; identical findings were pre- sented in a study by Prasad [18]. The Freeman, et al. study presented the vertical and horizontal head excur- sions in graphical form. It was illustrated that the maxi- mum forward displacement occurred just prior to the maximum downward displacement. The effect of varying the seat belt anchorage locations was also studied. It was found that forward head excursion increased by about 25 mm when the torso portion upper anchorage point was lowered by 1 50 mm. Pritz, et al. [19] performed impact tests to evaluate belted occupant dynamics. A 50th percentile Hybrid III ATD was restrained by a retractable lap and torso seat belt in a passenger seat and tests were conducted at an impact speed of 48 km/h. The standard configuration used a webbing length of 2.90 m. Subsequent tests considered additional belt length to accommodate larger occupants, but only forward excursion data for the standard configu- ration were referenced. It was noted that additional belt length permitted an increased amount of belt spool out and webbing elongation; thus, the forward excursion increased with additional belt length. Mertz, et al. [20] summarized impact simulations con- ducted with Hybrid III ATDs restrained by a three point seat belt system. Impact tests were conducted using a 24 km/h "Rigid Barrier" simulation and a 25 km/h "Mild Severity Pulse". The 24 km/h Rigid Barrier test had a cal- culated total speed change of about 28 km/h at an aver- age deceleration of about 9g while the 25 km/h Mild Severity Pulse had a calculated speed change of about 25 km/h at an average deceleration of about 7g. The results of a seat belt assembly fitted with a 2 kN load lim- iter was compared to a seat belt system without any load limiter. The test incorporated both a 50th percentile and a 95th percentile Hybrid III ATD. Forward head excursion was measured at the top of the subject's head; thus, the plotted trajectory was referenced and the total displace- ment of the subject's head center of mass was evaluated from the plotted trajectory. The results indicate that for a similar severity impact, the 95th percentile Hybrid III experiences increased forward head excursion as com- pared to the 50th percentile Hybrid III. Biss [21] conducted frontal and oblique impact tests using a Ford LTD/Crown Victoria front seat assembly fit- ted with standard lap and torso retractable seat belts. Frontal impacts were conducted at 48 km/h with a peak deceleration of about 21 g and at 56 km/h with a peak deceleration of about 27g. The total speed change of the impact tests was recorded to have been 52 km/h and 60 km/h, respectively. The restrained Hybrid III motion was recorded using high speed cameras, with frontal impact head trajectories presented in graphical form. The pri- mary focus of the Biss study was to examine the influ- ence of slack effects upon the restraint provided by a typical seat belt assembly. Biss concluded that a restrained occupant's maximum head speed and head displacement increased when increased slack was intro- duced into the torso portion of the seat belt. Only the test results without seat belt slack were referenced for this study. It was observed from the trajectory plots that the maximum head displacement occurred immediately prior to the maximum downward displacement. Crash performance studies were discussed by Dance, et al. [22]. Fifteen vehicles were impact tested at 48 km/h; they were fitted with restrained ATD'S in the operator and front passenger seats. Although the distance from the upper torso of the ATD to the steering wheel or dash- board was measured and it was recorded if head contact with the steering wheel or dashboard was made, the data were insufficient to determine the forward head displace- ment experienced by the ATD. However, the Dance, et al. study does provide an indication as to if head contact may be expected for occupants restrained in specific vehicles at 48 km/h impact speeds. Numerous other impact simulations and tests were con- ducted. Many of these other studies had different research objectives, and did not present data that could be applied to this study. The studies referenced in the determination of the expected head displacement of occupants restrained by lap and torso seat belt assemblies are summarized in Table 1. The summaries are referenced in order of increasing severity. 774</page><page sequence="5">Table 1 .

HUMAN AND CADAVERIC SUBJECTS - The referenced studies present kinematic data for various test subjects restrained by lap and torso seat belt assemblies. The ATD's used in the referenced studies were designed based on human biomechanical responses and were intended to simulate human kinematics in crash test con- ditions. Although the subjects may not identically repre- sent the typical human belted occupant in frontal accidents, tests conducted with ATDs may provide the best practical data available. The Prasad [18] study comparatively evaluated the dynamic Hybrid II and Hybrid III ATD's responses during frontal impacts. The ATD comparison was performed by conducting Hyge sled tests and barrier crash tests with three-point restraint systems. The sled pulse and barrier tests approximated a 56 km/h speed change. It was found that the torso of the Hybrid II twisted around the shoulder belt while the Hybrid III chest remained more aligned in the shoulder portion of the seat belt; the for- ward motion of the Hybrid III was shown to be more pla- nar than the motion of the Hybrid II. The Hybrid II has a shorter separation distance between the center of gravity of its head and the bottom of its neck; it also has a stiffer neck than the Hybrid III. Consequently, the head and neck of the Hybrid III tends to "whip" forward more than that of the Hybrid II during restrained frontal tests. In a study by Kallieris, et al. [11], the kinematics of ATDs and cadavers were compared. Kallieris, et al. found that the cadavers had greater head displacement than the ATDs. A later study by Saul, et al. [12] also compared ATD data with the cadaver results from Kallieris, et al. Saul, et al. concluded that his ATD impact test data were in good agreement with the cadaver results from Kallieris, et al. 775</page><page sequence="6">Another comparative study by Muzzy, et al. [23] evalu- ated the Hybrid II head and neck response against tests conducted on human subjects. Tests were conducted with subjects restrained by belt systems which exceeded the restraint available from a 3-point automotive type lap and torso seat belt assembly. Therefore, the results of the Muzzy, et al. study may not be applicable for the compar- ison of humans and ATDs restrained by motor vehicle type seat belts. However, the study summarized that although the forward head displacements of the humans and ATDs were similar, the downward displacement of the ATD was significantly less than the human subjects. It should also be noted that Muzzy, et al. tracked the dis- placement of the top of the subject's head; therefore, when the center of mass of the subject's head is consid- ered, the difference between the human and ATD response may be less pronounced. The most recently developed ATD is the THOR (Test device for Human Occupant Restraint). It has been designed to incorporate numerous biofidelic improve- ments over the previous generations of ATDs. Unfortu- nately, impact test data utilizing THOR were not readily available at the time of this study. RESULTS Before the relation for the expected forward head dis- placement could be determined and usefully applied for accident reconstruction purposes, a comparison of the forward head trajectories of the restrained subjects was conducted. Eight of the referenced studies provided the trajectory path of the subject's head during impact tests. These head trajectories spanned a range of impact speeds and various subject types; consequently, varying extents of forward head displacement were recorded. Comparison and evaluation of the trajectory paths was conducted by normalizing the horizontal component of the trajectory to a unit length. Although there was considerable variation within the tra- jectory path, the general trends were apparent. The tra- jectory path at the center of mass of the head typically initiated with a gentle downward slope which increased until the maximum forward excursion was achieved. The subject's head then recoiled rearward as it continued to rotate downward slightly. The motion of the head from the maximum forward displacement position to the maximum downward displacement position approximated a seg- ment of a circle centered at the initial location of the sub- ject's head center of mass. After the subject's head reached the point of maximum downward displacement, it was redirected toward its initial location. Only the for- ward and downward travel portions of the head trajectory were considered for the purposes and modeling of this study. It was found that the maximum head displacement could be accurately estimated by combining the maxi- mum forward and maximum downward head displace- ment. The maximum head displacement data for occupants restrained by lap and torso seat belt assemblies have been amalgamated from the described studies. The max- imum displacement has been referenced with respect to the center of mass of the head; it represents the com- bined forward and downward displacement of the head, measured from the test subject's initial seating position. Figure 1 illustrates the referenced head displacement. Figure 1 . Head Displacement The objective of this study was to relate the restrained occupant head excursion and impact speed; unfortu- nately, the required data were not always readily avail- able. The actual test speed change was provided in only some of the referenced studies. In other studies, the type of deceleration sled used in the impact tests suggested that the impact speed approximated the impact speed change. For the purpose of this study, if the referenced data did not specify the speed change of the test or did not provide a means to calculate the speed change, it was assumed that the impact speed approximated the speed change of the test. 776</page><page sequence="7">Figure 2. Maximum Head Displacement with Percentile Bounds Illustrated 111</page><page sequence="8">The maximum head displacement was plotted versus the impact speed change and is illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2 suggests that a direct relation may exist between the impact speed change and the maximum head excursion. Figure A1 in Appendix A provides the head displacement plotted versus impact speed given in imperial units. Applying a least squares method first order linear regres- sion to the data plotted in Figure 2 yields a relation of: Dm = [0.74 ±0.04]AV+ [14.0 ±1.7] (1) where: DM is the maximum head excursion, measured in cm. AV is the frontal impact speed change, measured in km / h. Higher order linear regression models were also consid- ered. The higher order regression models displayed trends in which the extent of forward displacement did not increase significantly with increased impact speeds at speed changes above about 50 km/h. However, statistical analysis of the higher order regression models indicated that the higher order regression relations could not pro- duce a confident correlation. Thus, only the first order lin- ear regression was assessed to provide a useful relation with sufficient confidence to predict the maximum head excursion expected during a frontal impact speed change. A first order bilinear correlation of the data was also con- sidered. There was an increased amount of standard error associated with the bilinear model as compared to the first order linear regression model. In addition, the first order bilinear model yielded a relation of maximum head excursion versus impact speed change which was bound within the standard error of the first order linear fit of the data considered. Thus, it was concluded that the first order linear correlation provided the most accurate and practical descriptor of the expected maximum head excursion incurred during a frontal impact of a known severity (i.e. speed change) by an occupant who is restrained by a lap and torso seat belt assembly. The variance in the data is relatively constant within the considered data set. As the upper percentile trends are more insightful than the lower trends for accident recon- struction purposes, the linear fits of the 85th and 98th per- centile of data are provided below: 85th percentile of data: DM = 0.80 A V + 1 6.5 (2) 98th percentile of data: DM = 0.83 AV+ 1 8.0 (3) where: DM is measured in cm AV is measured in km / h The human and cadaveric data are distinguished from the ATD data on Figure 2. The only human and cadaveric data available for reference purposes consisted of human subject data at speed changes of about 24 km/h and cadaveric data at about 56 km/h. It should be noted that the restrained human subjects average head displace- ment at about 24 km/h speed change was 31 .4 cm. Cor- respondingly, the expected head displacement calculated using the 50th percentile regression fit to all of the refer- enced data predicted a head displacement of 31 .2 cm. A similar comparison was conducted using the cadaveric data. The restrained cadavers sustained an average head displacement of 55.0 cm from a 56 km/h speed change. The calculated head displacement from the 50th percentile regression fit to all the available data predicted a mean head displacement of 55.2 cm resulting from a 56 km/h speed change. Therefore, although limited human and cadaveric data were available, these specific data are consistent with the results obtained when the entire data set is considered. A head excursion relation which incorporated the stature and weight of the restrained occupant was also attempted. Since only a limited number of the studies varied the statures and weights of the test subjects, a meaningful correlation which incorporated stature, weight, and displacement versus speed change could not be determined. The available data suggests that the stat- ure and weight of the restrained occupant had a minimal influence on the displacement versus speed change rela- tion. This provisional assessment result may change with additional relevant data. With the extent of maximum head displacement expected by a restrained subject involved in the frontal impact quantified, it was next necessary to mathematically define a typical trajectory path. This permits the complete modeling of the forward head excursion expected by a restrained subject. The available data permitted determination of the hori- zontal and vertical components of the maximum head displacement. From this information, the ratio of the for- ward to downward displacement was quantified. It was found that the ratio of the forward to downward head dis- placement was independent of the impact speed. It was calculated that the ratio of the maximum forward and maximum downward displacements yielded an average downward angle of about 30 degrees. However, it should be noted that there was considerable variance within the resulting angle derived from the maximum forward and downward displacements; the minimum and maximum ratios resulted in angles ranging from about 15 to 50 degrees. Review of the normalized head trajectory path indicated that the maximum forward displacement typically occurred at an angle of about 20 degrees down from the horizontal, measured from the initial rest position of the center of mass of the head. Following the point of maxi- mum forward head displacement, the head trajectory was found to trace a segment of an approximate circular path until the head reached the point of maximum downward displacement. It was assessed that the normalized trajectory path at the center of gravity of the subject's head followed a predict- able pattern. Therefore, the head trajectory for subjects restrained by lap and torso seat belts could be approxi- mated by a single representative relation, defined by as 778</page><page sequence="9">elliptical path. Since the ratio of the forward and down- ward displacement was independent of the impact speed change, the eccentricity of the elliptical path would also remain independent of the speed change. Modeling of the average elliptical head trajectory path is achieved by defining the eccentricity of the elliptical path. Referencing angles measured downward from the hori- zontal at the initial rest location of the subject's head, the maximum forward and downward displacements corre- spond to average values of about 20 degrees and 30 degrees, respectively. Between about 20 degrees and 30 degrees, the considered head trajectory was observed to approximately trace a segment of a circle centered about the initial rest location of the subject's head. The semi- major and the semi-minor axes of the average elliptical path inscribed by the subject's head are then defined as: a = Dm cos 0 (4) ¿&gt;=DMsin0 (5) where: a is the semi-major axis length b is the semi-minor axis length Dm is the maximum head displacement 0 is the angle at which maximum forward displacement occurs For the average case where the maximum forward head excursion occurs at about a 20 degree angle from the horizontal, the semi-major and semi-minor axes lengths of the ellipse can be defined with respect to the maximum head displacement distance (DM) as: a = 0.94 Dm (6) b = 0.34 Dm (7) Thus, the maximum head displacement and the typical head trajectory path expected by an occupant restrained by a lap and torso seat belt involved in a frontal collision may be readily determined and graphically presented. Figure 3. Average Trajectory Path for Center of Mass of the Subject's Head Figure 3 illustrates the average head trajectory path with its corresponding axes and reference angles. It should be noted that the elliptical trajectory is truncated at a 30 degree angle downward from the horizontal, measured from the initial rest position of the center of mass of the head. Beyond the 30 degree limit, the head trajectory does not typically continue to follow an elliptical path. DISCUSSION The results of this study are derived from a variety of sources which utilized various test configurations. Thus, the results of this study provide a generalized expression of the expected head excursion for occupants restrained by lap and torso seat belts who are involved in frontal impacts. Since there is some variance associated with the data, the confidence level of the maximum expected head excursion increases with an increased upper per- centile considered. Although the required confidence level depends on the application, the results of this study indicate that the forward head excursion expected from a frontal impact speed change, with a 98% confidence, is likely less than the relation defined by the equation: Dm = 0.83A'/+ 18.0 (8) where: DM is measured in cm A V is measured in km /h Although the regression fit represents the 50th percentile of the referenced data, it is not recommended to use the fit of the 50th percentile data to determine the expected head excursion of restrained occupants for accident reconstruction applications. It is suggested to apply the 98th percentile data model such that uncertainties are minimized. The predicted maximum head displacement and the cor- responding semi-major and semi-minor axes of the aver- age elliptical trajectory path as determined by equations (6), (7) and (8) are tabulated in Table B1 of Appendix B in both imperial and metric units. Table B1 provides the expected head displacement values, derived from the 98th percentile data model, for a given frontal impact speed change. Also included in Appendix B are the impe- rial versions of equations (6), (7) and (8). Since the considered data encompassed an impact severity range of about 1 6 to 60 km/h, the results of this study are valid within the referenced speed range. Above and below the referenced speed range, the results of this study must be applied with judgment. The results of this study are generated from the forward head excursion data for lap and torso seat belt restrained test subjects. Although this data set encompasses a wide spectrum of test conditions, further data may provide increased accuracy in the prediction of the forward head excursion expected for a specific frontal impact speed change. 779</page><page sequence="10">CONCLUSIONS This study amalgamated data from various research studies which investigated the head excursion of occu- pants restrained by lap and torso seat belts. The results of this study indicate that a first order linear regression could confidently model the expected maximum head excursion of a restrained occupant during a frontal impact. The trajectory path of the center of gravity of the subject's head was observed to follow a predictable pattern; the typical head excursion motion was modeled as tracing a segment of an elliptical path, with characteristics of this ellipse defined in terms of the impact speed change. This study presents a practical method for accident reconstructionists to determine the expected maximum head displacement trajectories of automobile occupants restrained by lap and torso seat belt during frontal impacts. The 98th percentile data model permits confi- dent assessment of the maximum expected head excur- sion trajectory, and is intended for practical application to the reconstruction of real-world motor vehicle accidents.

RECOMMENDATIONS It is recommended that future seat belt excursion studies consider various statures and weights of restrained test subjects over a range of impact speed changes. Such data would permit the influence of stature and weight to be quantified and incorporated into the head excursion model presented in this paper.
