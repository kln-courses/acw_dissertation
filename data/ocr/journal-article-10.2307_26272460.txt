Such slings, which might have been first used to carry gleanings, would have surrounded offspring in dangerous pathogens and parasites. Babies whose foetal body baldness had not disappeared would have had an advantage over infants with previously normal body fur, because adults could clean them better – probably resulting in the neotenic extension of the foetal trait. The microenvironment might have selected for the elimination of infectious pathways as well. The inactivation of the CMAH gene, which could have provided a pathway for pathogens associated with ungulate and proboscidean hides to infect infants with diarrhea, is explored as a candidate, and multiple ways of testing the hypothesis are described. The related hypothesis, which is based partly on avian comparisons and milk chemistry, postulates that slings gradually forced adults to focus on the kind of nutrition needed by more slowly maturing infant brains by making their babies more altricial. This might have triggered more scavenging, hunting, and feedback mechanisms that slowly extended the new juvenile hair distribution to adults as part of a whole-body cooling system based on sweat and body baldness while contributing to speciation.

After their first two months, chimp infants grasping reflexes – none of which are strong enough to tend to ride their mothers' backs, where they hold on hold on for long and disappear within a few weeks, as without support (Ross 2001) (Figure 1). The appearance of developmental benchmarks involving locomotion and posture (pushing off, sitting and standing without support, creeping on all fours, and walking bipedally) occur much later in baby humans than chimps, despite the fact that some psychological landmarks (i.e. distress at separation from mother, disappearance of blind rooting responses, production of social faces, and fear of strangers) follow similar time- lines (Falk 2004a, Plooij 1984). Modern human babies have several types of clinging reflexes, the earliest of which seem to be vestiges of early and strong grasping reflexes in our ancestors. These FIGURE 2. Once humans acquire tenacious clinging reflexes at least 6 months after birth, they can hold onto adults' neck, scalp, or carrying gear. This permits women like this Pygmy mother to use their carrying devices for other things than carrying infants. Hominins probably had to develop particularly strong reflexes within weeks of birth before the invention of slings, because they had to defy gravity more than baby chimps, who not only have grasping hands, but clasping feet, FIGURE 1. Baby chimpanzees can support their own weight by clinging and can ride adults' horizontal backs. The need for such strong to their mothers' ventral sides within 2 or 3 weeks, and only need reflexes probably forced bipedal hominins to be born with particularly occasional support before that. They usually ride on their mothers' backs mature brains until the invention of slings. This cerebral maturity once they reach two months old.

The loss of this platform, which allows apes to carry their young with little effort, was exacerbated by another consequence of bipedalism, the rigidification of hominin feet, which reduced the grasping ability of two of the limbs that baby chimps rely on (Alemseged et al. 2006). The combination of these factors would have made it harder for juveniles to hold on even if their elders retained body hair. This probably made it all the more important for baby australopithecines to maintain and even strengthen the kind of clinging reflexes seen in newborn chimps to help their mothers support them, until the invention of slings. This, in turn, would probably have forced them to be born with fairly mature brains. Carrying a baby in one's arms or on one's hips The two main ways for a bipedal mother to carry her FIGURE 3.

An example of such Furthermore, the first mothers to use baby slings natural and apparently clean sacks, which are rarely would no longer have required significant body hair for their infants to cling to – so biological investment in hair would have become increasingly unnecessary. But having such hair would have become an actual handicap to infants once they had to survive in enclosed baby- carrying devices, even if such containers were made of tanned leather and were highly sanitary – which is unlikely, since the first hide tools were probably stripped off eviscerated kills. This means that the skins probably came into contact with faeces that had been spread from dead animal intestines during butchering or feeding frenzies by predators and scavengers. Although such hides are often left bare by maggots, as can be seen in Peter Beard's (1978) remarkable photographs, and could have been further cleaned or even partially cured with some chewing and urine, they would actually have remained polluted with zoonoses, making them vectors FIGURE 4.

The oldest fairly small prey captured by hunter-gatherers and wastes from clear evidence is a Magdalenian engraving from infants themselves. The natural selection of traits that enhance the chance of an organism's survival in a new environment does not depend on that environment's size, so the effects of the encompassing microenvironments within such slings could have been just as dramatic as any climate change. The diversification of finches in the small niches on the already small islands of the Galapagos archipelago provides a classic example of how the isolation of organisms in tight environments with new selective pressures (Darwin 1859: 388–406) can create bottlenecks and founder's effects (Mayr 1942). Although babies' heads would usually have protruded from the sacks for respiration, infants' bodies would have had to adapt quickly to confinement in the microbial and parasite ridden conditions inside them.

Later, we will come to even more avian parallels, when we examine the similarities between hominin adaptations to slings and those of passerine birds, which have adapted to high parasite loads in nests by developing their own functionally bald, altricial infants (Møller et al. 1990, Rothschild, Clay 1961).

Such adjustments are known to occur is responsible for our species' bald bodies.

It is also subjected to a radical shift in their environment (or known that prosimians, which carry their young while microenvironment) to have lost their protective hair – lactating, produce more dilute milks than other prosimian even if hair was somewhat less important as a solar species which park their young while foraging (Tilden, shield. Wheeler might be right that bipedalism reduced Oftedal 1997). This implies that a species, which finds the need for body hair as a shield against the sun, but the ways to avoid the energy expense of carrying infants question remains, could hominins afford to undergo inefficiently and uses its time better to collect food, can radical hair loss until after the invention of the sling? produce richer milk.

But even the nursery theory for base camps supposedly lost most of their body hair and acquired requires that food be carried back to individuals who hydrodynamic hair patterns as an adaptation to were not gathering it for themselves – nannies and their swimming (Hardy 1960, Morgan 1997). This is doubtful charges – something that is difficult to do without both because many aquatic mammals in the human size carrying devices.

Similarly, newborn apes have relatively mature brains by comparison to their human counterparts, but Vestiary hypotheses their brains never grow as big or complex as a human's, There are those who argue that human bodies grew making apes more precocial than Homo sapiens. balder in response to clothing (Glass 1966, Kushlan 1985). If the differentiation of human head and body (clothes) lice around 190,000 years ago (Kitchen et al. 2010) was a response to the creation of a new louse environment in the form of clothes, then the lineage leading to modern humans should have started losing most of its body hair no earlier than then according to the vestiary hypothesis. Yet, once again, it has been shown that melanin probably increased to protect denuded skin from ultraviolet (LTV) radiation (Jablonski, Chaplin 2002) by at least 1.2 Ma (Rogers et al. 2004) while male Homo ergasters were exerting themselves so much by 1.53 Ma (Bramble, Lieberman 2004, Brown et al. 1985) that they must have had efficient whole-body cooling systems – putting bald bodies millennia before clothing. Avian strategies and adaptations  to parasite-ridden nests Another type of infant that must survive confinement is baby birds in nests (Figure 9). The two most extreme strategies that birds evolved for surviving in these parasite- ridden places (Møller et al. 1990, Rothschild, Clay 1961) relate directly to the altricial-nutrient hypothesis, since they concern the effect of having more altricial babies on adult cravings for fats and proteins, and the parents' consequent recourse to increased meat acquisition. The first strategy is to hatch with high mobility, lots of down, and open eyes – in other words, with levels of maturity closer to those observed among ape babies than human infants. Such birds, which leave the nest within FIGURE 9. Young passerine birds like these robins resemble baby two days and quickly forage for their own food, are humans in several ways. These include loud cries that seem to have "precocial". The opposite strategy is to hatch earlier with evolved in response to their need to draw attention to themselves in little or no down, closed eyes, and a basic feeding nursery-like environments, nearly bald bodies, which reduces hiding reflex – and to depend entirely on parents for food for an places for parasites, and richer diets than their precocial cousins. extended period.

The present hypotheses point in several (Ehrlich et al. 1988). Humans are similar with a mix of directions that were either unexplored or just glanced on semi-precocial traits (brains which are as big as they can during the debate over Dean Falk's (2004a, 2004b, 2009) possibly be given the rigidity of the human birth canal, hypothesis concerning the importance of baby-parking as a result of bipedalism, and open, but unfocused, eyes) before the use of slings for the development of motherese and altricial characteristics, including bald-bodied and language. newborns, with high rates of postnatal brain growth and The first of these directions concerns the intervals helplessness. That mixture, which gives humans, like between an infant's sessions in unsanitary containers, parrots, the benefits of both strategies, probably came when a mother would have had to clean, and just as about when baby slings forced users towards investing importantly, in light of the bacterial blooms caused by more time in nurturing offspring with one or more such confinement (Suter et al. 2011), dry infants. These slowed developmental rates. intervals correspond to the daily, and often more Passerine birds, which are all altricial, have two more frequent, bath times of modern infants (Falk 2009: 25) insights to impart. The first is that they tend to collect foods (Figure 10), when so much of the face-to-face and that are richer in fats and proteins than those of precocial kinesthetic interaction between mothers and their species. Their helpless chicks need such food more than offspring that has been described by Stern (1985), Eibl- precocial ones since their brains still have so far to grow Eibesfeldt (1989), Bråten (2004), Trevarthen, and others (Ehrlich et al. 1988). By removing the constraint on takes place. Although such interaction also occurs during helplessness, which opened the path to neotenic cerebral bottle feeding (Schögler, Trevarthen 2007: Fig. 3), it is development, and inducing a second type of neoteny as not so much the case with breast-feeding. The feeding of a means of creating quick body baldness, the invention of solid foods, which often meant the mouth-to-mouth the sling might have forced hominin bands – like passerine passage of food masticated by mothers even after the birds – to focus more on collecting protein-and-fat-rich invention of cooking and gruel (Forge, Evans-Pritchard foods in order to produce the type of nourishment required by more altricial babies with brains which could and increasingly did mature later than before. If the subsistence strategy of the first sling users shifted even slightly towards obtaining such foods, then the invention of the sling might have set off the feedback mechanisms mentioned above in regard to scavenging and hunting. The final insight involves the way altricial nestlings have adapted to long periods in containers by creating the equivalent of disposable diapers by excreting "fecal sacs" (Campbell, Lack 1985: 433). These thick protein bubbles filled with excrement are so strong that the parents can pick them up in their beaks and fly them out of the nests, before the wastes draw pathogens and parasites. The lesson of these observations is that any animal which must survive in potentially infectious microenvironments – including the first hominins to use and be carried in slings – probably has to adapt to them both biologically and behaviorally. FIGURE 10. Modern infants, such as this newborn Wodaabe girl, tend The implications of alternating confinement and bath to be washed daily, if not more often.

A modern equivalent to the piggy-back position is allowing a child to "drive" on one's lap, while the adult does the steering. The sudden combination of a new need for cleaning and drying intervals and placement of children in nearly immobilized positions, which might have aligned them with their mothers' perspectives, would have profoundly changed the potentialities of two patterns of maternal- infant communication simultaneously. Each of these yoked situations would have provided fertile new ground for the development of communication features associated with mirroring, with the developments probably leveraging off each other. The result might have been that slings not only became baby incubators, but neurological and cultural ones as well. The fact that slings would have made it easier to bring provisions to nannies and their charges in nurseries that doubled as base camps would have amplified these trends by adding a third type of situation, creches, to perspective-sharing during transportation, and face-time during cleanings. CONCLUSION In summary, the first hominin mother to put her infant into a sling, who might have been an immediate precursor to the Homo genus, transformed herself into an artificial marsupial and invented a tool that opened the path towards the emergence of more slowly maturing brains and more complex communication. Put another way, both Homo sapiens and its entire genus might be products, in part, of adaptations to the most influential tool of all time – the baby sling. But the hairy inventor's brain would not have departed very much from the ratio of newborn-to-adult brain sizes among chimpanzees and australopithecines. The invention of the baby sling quite simply had to have taken place before adaptations that, FIGURE 11.
