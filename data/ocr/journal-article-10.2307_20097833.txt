British International Studies Association DOI: 10.1017IS0260210503000032 Duelling constructivisms: a post-mortem on the ideas debate in mainstream IR/IPE JOHN KURT JACOBSEN* Abstract: The ideas debate in mainstream IR/IPE was generated by cumulative dissatis factions with rational choice theory and with Realist tenets. This article examines the contours of this debate and explains how it reached its limit in the form of 'conventional constructivism', a bowdlerised form of critical theory and Gramscian cultural studies. 'Context' and Gramsci's 'common sense', however, are sufficiently equivalent terms to enable productive conceptual connections across the intradisciplinary divide. The overarching obstacle remains the resistance of mainstream IR to integration with other social sciences. The experience of a critic putting one's ideas 'into context' often rankles and sometimes with good reason. Except in the rare circumstances of equal status, goodwill and an unstinting search for common ground, as expressed perhaps in Habermas' ideal speech situation, the exercise can be a subtly negating one that simply fits an adversary's argument inside one's own framework in order to tell them what they meant to say if only they had sufficient rigour and wit to do so.l This tactic is commonly is wielded by mainstream scholars against those on the disciplinary fringes - and, whenever possible, vice versa. The rationales are, for the mainstream, that fringe frameworks such as critical theory and Gramscian cultural studies are of interest only to the degree that one converts these analytical modes into positivist and measurable terms by which means alone they are to be deemed scientific, and, for scholars outside the mainstream, that positivism - which holds no known patent on testable propositions - frequently functions as a device by which to exclude forms of analysis that challenge the scholarly status quo.2 Scholars at the fringes argue that, as in the classic relation of coloniser and colonised, they have every incentive to study the dominant discourse while the reverse phenomenon is rarely the case.3 Marginal modes of inquiry accordingly gain * Earlier versions of this article were presented at the Workshop on Ideas, Culture and Political Analysis at Princeton University and at the Program on International Politics, Economics, and Security (PIPES) at the University of Chicago.

I examine this subtle filtration process at work in the recent ideas debate in American - virtually synonymous with 'mainstream' - international relations and consider whether the ascent of 'conventional constructivism' forms a new barrier or a boon to alternative frameworks. If 'historicising IPE', a central goal of non-mainstream scholars, means to pro mulgate transdisciplinary, non-state-centred and reflexive frames of thinking, then this aim remains dismayingly low on the mainstream agenda.4 Despite all the attention lavished on a single form of constructivism, one detects little evidence that countertrends such as critical theory or Gramscian cultural studies have made any inroads in the debates that preoccupy American IR journals. In fact, it is unusual even for self-described constructivists to display any awareness of debates in the alternative (and mostly British or, even, continental) journals.5 There are exceptions, but they tend to prove the rule. The constructivist 'turn', if it is one, is an enteprise explicitly devoted to 'seizing the middle ground' and succeeds to the degree it has largely by appropriating or approximating alternative critical constructs and concerns.6 The 'new' research agenda it posits already existed in radical European traditions but could be imported into the mainstream only when palatably rendered, a not unprecedented pheno menon.7 In any field it is difficult to offer fresh or unfamiliar perspectives in forms other than ones 'readily acceptable to the 'profession.'8 (Whether critical theory, in the form it takes in British studies, lives up to its avowed standards is an interesting but separate question.)9 Scanning American IR journals for signs of dialogue with alternative sch?mas one finds Robert Cox occasionally cited but hardly anyone else who works in a critical theory or Gramscian tradition is ever noticed. This 'silence', as social historians might term it, should be no surprise. Mainstream scholarship, as a recent survey soberly reminds, is not in the business of promoting the 'emanci patory interests' that motivate some other scholars.10 This pertinent point about purposes has major implications for the ways in which mainstream and non mainstream scholars grapple with the nature of contexts in political analysis. In the aftermath of the ideas debate two key questions arise: (1) Has mainstream IR fixed its limit of permissible debate at the border of 'conventional construc tivism,' as rendered by Wendt, Checkel, Adler and others? And (2) is there any 4 Ash Amin and Ronan Palen, 'Editorial: The Need to Historicise IPE', Review of International Political Economy, 3: 2 (Summer 1996), p. 209. 5 See Knud Erik Jorgenson, 'Continental IR Theory: The Best Kept Secret', European Journal of International Relations, 6: 1 (March 2000), pp. 1-33. and, almost aberrantly, Ole Waever, 'The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline: European and American Developments in International Relations', International Organization, 52: 4 (Autumn 1998). 6 Jeff Checkel, 'The Constructivist Turn in International Relations Theory', World Politics, 50: 2 (January 1998) and Emanuel Adler, "Seizing The Middle Ground: Constructivisim in World Polities', European Journal of International Relations, 3: 3 (1997). 7 On the derivative relation of Theda Skocpol's neo-Weberian stance to neo-Marxist scholarship see Paul Cammack, 'Bringing the State Back In?', British Journal of Political Science, 19: 2 (April 1989). 8 Friedrich Kratochwil, 'Constructing a New Orthodoxy?

The influence that contexts exert upon the interpretation that individuals and collectivities make of their interests and, consequently, their choices has been underplayed in IR because of realist axioms regarding the immutability of systemic imperatives and of national interests. Realists today are more attentive to the influence of contexts upon state behaviour but according to a strictly managerial orientation 'fixing the realm of the possible in terms of permissible social and political actions.'12 Realists, neorealists and even liberal institutionalists tend to embrace the given distribution of interests and capabilities with the same impatient panache with which Samuel Johnson allegedly refuted Bishop Berkeley's nominalist fancies by giving the nearest stone a swift kick.13 By contrast, critical theorists, harking to the 1930s heyday of the Institute for Social Research headed by Max Horkheimer, held that what today are called 'discursive formations' always fashioned our knowledge of the world within a range of possibilities set by the context of historically specific structures of power - a context of which we scholars and citizens are, at best, only partially aware. The project of the Frankfurt School was to devise an 'interdisciplinary materialism' geared to 'pursue philosophical questions with the most refined scientific methods, to reformulate and sharpen these questions in the course of the work, to devise new methods, and yet not lose sight of the larger context.'14 This larger context - explicitly encompassing those engaged in analysing it - was understood primarily though an unorthodox but fertile blend of Marxism and psychoanalysis. The critical theorists stressed that a valid macroconceptualisation of political life required rigorous multidisciplinary research in order to illuminate the effects of a given political-economic structure upon institutions and individuals - which have different degrees of autonomy and reflective capacity - and, in turn, their cumulative effects upon that structure. This approach was, so far as critical theorists saw it, kindergarten dialectics. Contemporary constructivists are approaching what critical theorists have long taken as their research starting point. For the latter, however, the willingness to understand the importance of context must be infused with the will to change or resist it.15 Critical theory took pains to distinguish itself from 'traditional 11 The Frankfurt theorists were divided: at one extreme Adorno 'saw an internal reform of the social sciences as futile'. Horkheimer thought prospects were a bit better.

This internal or immanent encounter with the existing order, however, retained a transcendent or Utopian component. The objective was to foster reflexivity, a capacity for fantasy, and a new basis for praxis in an increasingly alienated world. Critical theory, in this way, stood diametrically opposed to economic determinism and any stage theory of history. It sought to examine the various "mediations" between base and superstructure.'

Critical theory, Horkheimer writes, 'was incompatible with the idealist belief that any theory is independent of men or has a growth of its own.'16 No less than for Karl Korsch or Georg Lukacs in the Western Marxist tradition, philosophy for Antonio Gramsci was never 'purely contemplative, theory itself engenders practice' and it exerted 'practical, even political consequences, even if it is avowedly non political.'17 Habermas characterised the Frankfurt project as pursuing 'philosophy by other means, namely the social sciences,' and with no inhibitions about crossing disciplinary boundaries in order to create an appropriate analytical synthesis for the study of societies.18 Critical theory, thus understood, forms a key component in the analytical arsenal of many scholars on the margins of the discipline, as odd as it seems to describe as 'fringe' a theoretical mode that is considered a major player in international studies outside the United States.19 Any scholar who spends significant time in the US and the UK cannot help but be struck by the virtually parallel universes inhabited by American and British IR scholars (for whom neo-Marxist influences have long been part of the post-imperial mainstream).20 The conservative slant of American IR studies preceded congres sional witch-hunts but McCarthyism certainly quietened what few dissident voices there were.21 A slowly waning legacy of the latter in the social sciences is discourage ment not only of radical scholarship but even of any questioning of state-defined managerial imperatives in the American sphere of influence. Today this cross-Atlantic schism in IR studies may stem more from disciplinary boundary maintenance. Every lively debate in British international studies also appears in American academe, though usually in the adjacent fields of comparative politics, historical sociology and public policy where American IR specialists traditionally have been reluctant to tread. Still, at the brink of the 1990s, mainstream scholars significantly conceded that ideas, under certain circumstances, do matter; and this concession opened up opportunities for multidisciplinary explorations and cross-fertilisations.22 A spate of ideas-oriented arguments quickly emerged or, in some cases, were resurrected. Here I assess why neither a critical theory nor Gramscian-based approach, despite high visibility elsewhere in the profession, made a direct or acknowledged impact in the debate at a time when so many attempts were made to integrate an ideational 16 Horkheimer, 'Traditional and Critical Theory', in Critical Theory: Selected Essays (New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1972), p. 240. 17 Thomas Nemeth, Gramsci's Philosophy: A Critical Study (Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1986), p. 15.

The version I believe most compatible - indeed, almost interchangeable - with Frankfurt critical theory stems from Stuart Hall's trail-blazing work. 20 On American and British IR practices see J. K.

In ensuing sections I introduce pertinent insights from psychologically trained analysts, examine the American debate about ideas, assess prospects of a 'theory of contexts' as a bridge, and conclude with an assessment of the relation of constructivism to critical theory, and of both to mainstream (mainly American) scholarship. My central argument is that 'conventional constructivism', as now inducted into the mainstream, poses severe limitations for IR studies, and that engagement with (if not wholehearted acceptance of) the 'critical' variant of constructivism improves analytical sensitivity to the intricate interaction of ideas and interests, the 'mutual constitution' of agent and structure, and the role of the investigators in whatever they are investigating. Rationality and contexts The first task is definitional. Context is 'that which environs the object of our interest and helps by its relevance to explain it.'23 In standard usage a context is the background against which we pose pertinent facts. Contextualising is assumed to be unproblematic; one merely brings to light salient features of the environment, like silhouettes.24 In a second and quantitative sense 'contextual analysis' comes into play when examining 'the way the relationship between two variables (for example, two individual-level variables, or perhaps an individual and a context variable) may change systematically, for individuals, across groups which are set up to differ in a systematic way on a group-level variable.25 Finally, in a critical - not just critical theory - tradition, a context, when brought into what an interested agent portrays as its proper focus, imbues data with a new meaning. One reconfigures the context - the very sinews of everyday common sense - and sees a larger or different picture, incorporates new factors and shifts the relative importance of various explanatory factors according to one's training, interests, ideational inclinations and unconscious predilections. What is desirable in one context - privatising public transport, capital punishment, an international anti drug war - may appear perfectly pernicious when placed convincingly in another.26 Only the way the world is viewed changes but this activity triggers actions that can alter the physical world. Whether globalisation or whatever the third way is are viewed as desirable things hinges on how cultural notions of justice inflect one's experience when interpreting events or evaluating arguments. Results often depend on the capacities of competing elites to attach or align their particular agenda to public norms, beliefs, and values. 23 Ben-Ami Scharfstein, The Dilemma of Context (New York: New York University Press, 1989), p. 1. 24 This is assumed even when scholars distinguish between a 'proximate context' (in which a specific policy operates) and 'macro context' (including ramifications in larger political and economic spheres), Martin Rein and Donald Schon, 'Refraining Policy Discourse', in Frank Fischer and John Forester (eds.), The Politics of Problem Definition: Shaping The Policy Agenda (Durham: Duke University Press, 1993), pp. 154-5. 25 Herman J,.

Instead they promote the goal of greater efficiency - a 'harmonization of national laws that will remove barriers and encourage greater trade'.27 A congressional bill designed to slash aid to the poor was dubbed the 'Personal Responsibility and Job Opportunity Act'. The political world doesn't turn, it spins, and it is hard for the nimblest to keep their footing in this slippery interpretative milieu. Few participants in the ideas debate aimed at anything more ambitious than expanding the conceptual base of reigning models. Ideas usually were seen as factors to be plugged into dominant frameworks or else as ad hoc devices. There was no intention that an ideas-oriented model, however well grounded, could become a rival to Realism/neo-Realism, liberal institutionalism, or the rational choice methods that increasingly suffuse them. It seems all the more extraordinary that a highly idealist version gained entry. Still, in mainstream studies what distinguishes a palatable ideas approach from 'soft' cultural or psychological models is that ideas are explicit programmatic ways of organising institutions, and their distributions of benefits and costs. These ideas are 'shared beliefs', which exclude idiosyncratic and leader-specific notions. By definition they can be intersubjectively validated. So one may be atten tive to cultural and/or psychological insights if they adhere to this shared character. The next section examines historical insights about the application of rationalist models as presented by social scientists, who in a non-Marxian but dialectical vein, had come to conclusions very similar to those drawn by critical theorists. The 'silences' in rationalist social science extend well beyond treatment of Marxian scholarly critiques. Psychology, science and 'silences' Regarding B. F. Skinner's behaviourist fancies, a New Yorker cartoon long ago depicted two lab rats inside a cage chatting about a nearby scientist. One rodent brags: 'Have I ever got that guy trained. Whenever I press this lever, he gives me a pellet.' The point is that the subject, even in loaded-dice circumstances, 'elaborates and participates in that to which it responds' - that is, the stimulus intervenes according to what it signifies in the situational context for the subject.28 In the field of psychology the notion of the isolated reflex or response was exposed long ago as 'a pathological dissociation of organismic activity prominent only within the luxurious confines of a laboratory - an anthropomorphic illusion.'29 Human beings - if not ensconced in Dachau or held at gunpoint - are even more difficult to control or divine. A human being does not only have a hand and a heart', Crozier observed. 'He also has a head, which means that he is free to decide his own game. This is what almost all proponents of human relations theories, as well as their early rational proponents, tend to forget.'30 27 William Greider, One World, Ready or Not (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997), p. 34. 28 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Structure of Behavior (Boston, MA: Beacon Press, 1963), p. 45. 29 Merleau-Ponty, The Phenomenology of Perception ( New York: 1962), pp. 67-174. 30 Michel Crozier, The Bureaucratic Phenomenon (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago, 1967), pp. 158, 162.</page><page sequence="7">Duelling constructivisms: the ideas debate in IR/IPE 45 In mainstream IR literature those beneath leadership level are regarded as 'natives' once were in the anthropological canon. These subalterns 'could be observed enacting their culture, fulfilling cultural obligations, and behaving in culturally appropriate ways, but they were not expected to be self-conscious or reflective, capable of subjectivity, choice or contestation,' a critic writes.31 'The cultural scripts that constructed them were written by "us"; these told them who they were and how they should behave. [Today, by contrast, through their own eyes] we see culture in the making as well as in the doing: how agency and structure interact, how culture shapes self, and how self shapes culture.' Constructivists, in their unduly restrictive social-psychological view of identity - a conceptualization of identity arising in reactive fashion from the 'reflective appraisals' of others - do not seem to fully grasp this otherwise congenial point. Even George Herbert Mead had a far more active, and arguably subversive, view of the perceiving subject than some disciples appreci ate.32 Still, constructivism improves upon rational choice theory in its view of the beings inhabiting its modelled universe. Rational choice theory depicts its individuals as optimising under a given set of constraints. But are constraints impervious to interpretative variations? For the sake of convenience interests are regarded as given and prior to the beliefs held by actors, so that ideas are relegated to the limbo of unexplained variance. Rational choice concedes that ideas can be important 'because unique predictions cannot be generated through an examination of interests and strategic interaction (utility functions and payoff matrices) because almost all 'games with repeated play have multiple equilibria.'33 The translation of 'interest into appropriate policy' (and preceding that, preference) is problematic.'34 Because actors cannot guarantee the consequences of their actions, it is the 'expected effects of actions that explains them'. In short, what actors expect is elaborated 'in their heads' although the evidentiary basis for these expectations is not. The mind lives 'on images, absorbing and re-creating them as a basis for all understanding and action': these shared images are 'the means of symbolically combining inner emotional experience with various prevailing ideological currents' in a given time and place.35 When wielding this potent imagery, Erikson observed, 'no actor and no effective innovator is really independent, nor can he dare to be entirely original: his originality must consist in the courage and singular concen tration with which he expresses an existing imagery - at the proper time.'36 This imagery - 'magic of the marketplace', 'peace through strength', 'Germany encircled', 31 Lloyd I.

See the discussion of Mead in Floyd W. Matson, The Broken Image: Man, Science and Society (New York; Anchor Books, 1964). pp. 170-175. Mead may be closer in spirit to Stuart Hall than to Harry Stack Sullivan's theory of 'reflected appraisals', which is the usual touchstone of the conventional constructivists. 33 Judith Goldstein and Robert Keohane (eds.)

Rational choice itself is derived from a context-bound image of the way minds work. Fair enough when applied with caution, but formal frameworks generate irrational behaviour when practitioners are insensitive to context-dependence. In Vietnam, local combatants on both sides of the 17th Parallel regarded the typical Western equation of what is real with what is countable (body counts, tonnage dropped, sorties flown) as a very violent form of mysticism indeed.37 What was overlooked by authorities - apart from all discouraging data - was the overspilling of 'disintegrate tendencies into the realm of idea systems and images [causing] a breakdown not only of social institutions but of the shared symbols necessary to ordered existence - symbols defining rhythms of life and death, group loyalties, and the nature of reality'.38 Rational reward-punish models employed by policymakers misunderstood the history, motives and strategies of their opponents.39 What invariably gets lost is the connection between normative ends and instrumental means. So a rationalist model, by deprecating 'soft' phenomena of culture or social psychology, frustrated the aims for which it was intended to be the most effective means.40 One might have more confidence in hard-nosed realists if they were not inclined to such startling misjudgements as the claim that America lost the Vietnam war 'due to deficiencies of our ally' and declaring culture irrelevant because the NVA and Viet Cong, on one hand, and the South Vietnamese army, on the other, 'were products of similar strategies and political cultures'.41 Culture is an extremely slippery and problematic term, but that is hardly a good reason for abandoning or deriding its use. 'One often is forced to resort to broad definitions', as critical theory-oriented scholars note, such as 'any interpersonally shared system of meanings, perceptions and values'.42 Still, even the way pain is experienced depends on 'genetic endowment, and on at least four functional factors 37 Michael Novak, The Experience of Nothingness (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1970), p. 35. 38 Lifton, History and Human Survival, pp. 216-17. 39 In contrast to a 'conventional warrior mentality', a former central committee member contends that in the NLF, 'every military clash, every demonstration, every propaganda appeal was seen as a part of an intelligible whole: each had consequences far beyond its immediate apparent result. It was a framework that allowed us to view battle as a psychological event and to undertake negotiations in order to strengthen the military posture. The Americans seemed never to appreciate fully this strategic perspective ... It was after all a traditional Vietnamese approach to warfare, a technique refined over centuries of confrontation with invaders more powerful than ourselves.' Truong Nhu Tang, A Viet Cong Memoir (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1985), pp. 86-87, 212. 40 W^fiy policymakers cling to such models despite persistent adverse 'feedback' has not to my knowledge been the subject of the application of rational methods. 41 Michael C. Desch, 'Culture Clash: Assessing the Impact of Ideas in Security Studies' International Security 23, 1 (Summer 1998), p. 147. 'The functions, actions, and values of officers and soldiers are the inevitable consequence of the kinds of societies they are seeking to create or defend. This social context defines the character of the officer corps and the soldiers, their relationship to each other, and their human, social and economic impact on the population. Strategy mirrors this reality and in turn weighs strongly on the balance of forces. This framework exerts an overriding influence on soldiers' motivations in battle and an army's ability to endure protracted war. In this vital regard the Vietnam War was from its inception a very unequal battle between radically different kinds of armies.'

All these are shaped by social determinants, ideology, economic structure and social character.'43 Even in diagnosing mental illness, culture defines certain symptoms as legitimate so that patients can latch onto approved ways of expressing their underlying anguish, whether this be invoking evil spirits, hysteria or genetic maladies.44 For Williams culture consisted of 'known meanings and directions, what the members are trained to; [and] the new observations and meanings, which are offered and tested' and is 'always both traditional and creative'.45 Culture requires its due, even if in the futile exercise of converting it into terms congenial to a positivist agenda.46 I say 'futile' not because this cannot be done in principle but because no definition of culture which allows for adequate complexity and reflexivity (as Williams implies) ever pleased positivists, who cannot conceive that they themselves may form a 'culture' and not the last word in science, and to whom every 'soft' concept looks manipulable and untrustworthy.47 Yet ideas cannot be infinitely manipulable because an inhibiting cultural context - what Gramsci called 'common sense' - exists. Common sense, for Gramsci, 'define[s] the terms of public political discourse; it is embodied in social practices and therefore must be considered a material force' and 'civil society' is the sphere in which the struggle to define the categories of common sense takes place.48 I suggest below that context can function as a mainstream counterpart to Gramsci's 'common sense' - a sufficiently equivalent term that permits conceptual connections to occur across the intradisciplinary divide between mainstream scholars and constructivists, and between rival constructivist camps. (Horkheimer and Adorno, of course, despised 'common sense' when construed as a keen folk wisdom.) In non-main stream studies the Gramscian definition of 'the constitutive character of common sense' has been put to provocative use.49 Should and can mainstream scholars be lured by, or prodded into, the need to develop a counterpart theory of contexts ? Realists often allow that social beliefs influence how actors relate their interests to changing material circumstances (different contexts). For one domestic example, the reason why sterilisation of 'mentally defective' people was spurned in Britain in the 1930s, and welcomed in 19 US states, Scandinavia and Germany, was rooted in 'the moral and ideological environment', this eugenical measure 'infringed fundamental ideas about individual rights and social responsibility' in Britain.50 Citizens' judge ments in both domestic and international realms seem to be shaped not only by 43 Ivan Illich, Medical Nemesis (New York: Bantam, 1976), p. 132. 44 Joel Pfister, 'Cultural History of Emotions in Psychological Life', in Joel Pfister and Nancy Schnog (eds.)

A theory of contexts seems in order. From a critical theory perspective, struggles about meaning are struggles about power - although, for critical theorists, reflexivity justifiably is intertwined with force only in order to mitigate violence, or its arbitrary use.51 Scholars who promote policies purely on their scientific merits tend to get rudely awakened as to how ideas are adapted to suit the agendas of self-aggrandising groups.52 This is not to say that ideas mean exactly what their sponsors want them to mean; economic ideas, and the contexts in which they are presented, are contestable and never ultimately settled, at least not by argument. At the conclusion of the recent ideas debate, which saw a guarded welcome of 'conventional constructivists' into the mainstream, many scholars belatedly arrived at many of the same conclusions as critical theorists, if by a more roundabout and dubious path. The key liability of this latest disciplinary development is that ideas, whose power was beginning to be appreciated again, tended to become untethered from interests. Reconnoitring the ideas debate Peter Hall's influential volume on Keynesianism examined the ways in which ideas affect coalition-building and how 'administrative-political processes affected the selection of economic ideas'.53 What matters is not the idea's intrinsic force in a given context but whether the idea reconciles the interests of elites within the institutional processes of a state so that a coalition emerges to enact the resulting agenda. The more powerful the sponsors, the more powerful the ideas. Goldstein went a step further in arguing that the 'power of the idea itself explains its accep tance', but her trade policy study consistently retreated into a political sponsorship argument.54 The unabashedly idealist case advanced by some contributors - that ideas exert a force all their own - was never persuasive.55 The inherent snarl is that the claim that the 'power of the idea itself explains its acceptance' first must demonstrate that interests are interpenetrated by ideas, then these same ideas must be shown to exert influence untainted by the very interests they have just been shown to inter 51 Eagleton, The Idea of Culture, p. 107. 52 See Robert Reich, Locked in The Cabinet (New York: Knopf, 1997).

The hypothesis was afflicted by the tempting manoeuvre where interests are shown to become embedded in an idea (such as Keynesianism) whose institutionalisation supposedly proves that agents were mesmerised by the 'power of ideas' all along. One loses sight of the materialistic motives driving the success of an idea and so one ends by fetishising ideas. Ideas and material circum stances, according to critical theory and Gramscian cultural studies, axiomatically are found together, mutually influence one another, and are not reducible one to the other. The mainstream's challenge, as shown in the next section, was to arrive at a similar proposition without hauling tainted theoretical baggage along. Mainstream scholars readily agree that ideas affect groups by influencing how they relate their interests to circumstances, and they agree that ideas trigger changes of the context - which itself is comprised of intellectual precepts and institutional arrangements fixing the limits of permissible action. At times the context itself can be at stake in contests among groups promoting rival projects. This context affects the kinds of issues that appear salient, by creating or altering expectations - that is, creating the 'background psychological operating system' within which new ideas and interpretative ploys come into play. While ideas alone do not create interests, mainstream scholars concede that material constraints are subject to some significant degree to the ideas or to the perceptions that actors have about them. Ideas and interests are both concepts and therefore are ideas because 'interests are perceived through the lenses of the existing ideologies in various historical settings'.57 But it does not follow from this tricky proposition that interests are 'only' ideas that change once we change our view of reality. It is impossible to describe an action without reference to the ideas and meanings that inform it.58 The intrinsic interlacing of material interest by ideational influences appears to be an infernally difficult concept to grasp. Few positivists or even constructivists comprehend this point, and when they do, they slip quickly back to an interest versus ideas dichotomy or else begin to fetishise the power of pure discourse. Take a prominent scholar's survey of IR in which he equates the 'ideational approach' with a diarrhetically relativist rendition of constructivism emphasising 'the capacity of discourse to shape how political actors define themselves and their interests, and thus modify their behaviour'.59 Discourse is described as if divorced from interest or power. The author informs us that this approach 'largely replaced Marxism as the pre-eminent radical perspective in international affairs' when, in fact, important variants of constructivism stem precisely from this 'replaced' tradition.60 In fact, the project of cultural studies aims to demonstrate that political economy is thoroughly 'cultural without ceasing to be material' and 'that what students of literature and art call "cultural" is economic, not as base to superstruc 56 Goldstein, Ideas, Interests and American Trade Policy, p. 2 fn. 1. 57 Robert H.

Goldstein and Keohane, to be sure, 'recognise that ideas and interests are not phenomenologically separate', but their prime question 'is the extent to which variations in beliefs, or the manner in which ideas are institutionalised in societies, affect political action' and it is in pursuit of this purpose that slips occur into dubious claims for the force of ideas. This tack also lures them into justifying ideas in terms of their fit to a formal model so that an 'idea as commodity' metaphor ultimately is deployed.63 Policymakers, they say, rely on causal models when making choices, and policy entrepreneurs 'depend on ideas about how to translate these forces into a political and economic program'.64 However, these maps must meet interest-bound criteria so that even 'efficiency is valued only to the extent that the means to a goal adhere to existing ideas, values, and institutions'. Actors are usually very well aware that the rules established in the victory of an economic idea constrains future choices {via path dependence), as exemplified by the recent protests against WTO policies. The constructivist turn, as critical theorists behold it, is what is left after one removes the Marxian cores of critical theory and cultural studies.65 Alex Wendt phrases his constructivist case as arguing for a 'cognitive, intersubjective conception of science in which identity and interests are endogenous to interaction' rather than 'exogenously given by structure'.66 Interaction is again divorced from structure, or is left tenuously tied to it (through a 'rump materialism'). Wendt argued that anarchy acquires different meanings for different actors based on pre-existing 'communities of in ter subjective understandings and practices' - a proposition that draws us close to the implication that some communities are privileged clubs whose privileges are bestowed by or wrung out of a material culture.67 This claim approximates a critical theory position but simply is not teased out to any degree that threatens to link identity formation with material forces. The rupture point between conventional and critical constructivists is the former's assertion that 'the 61 Iris Marion Young, 'Unruly Categories: A Critique of Nancy Fraser's Dual Systems Theory', New Left Review, 222 (March/April 1997 [Summer 1992]), p. 120. 62 Helen Milner, 'International Political Economy: Beyond Hegemonic Stability', Foreign Policy, 110 (Spring 1998), pp. 116, 117. 63 Mark Laffey and Jutta Weldes, 'Beyond Belief: Ideas and Symbolic Technologies in the Study of International Relations', European Journal of International Relations, 3 (1997), pp. 194-5. 64 Charles Maier, In Search of Stability (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1986), p. 45. 65 See George Steinmetz, State I Culture, pp. 13-76.

Wendt occasionally allows for the impor tance of ideas being 'mediated by power relations'.69 But Checkel and Adler, among others, insist that constructivists are staking out a perfectly sensible middle ground between mainstream scholars and postmodernists.70 Is this really the case?71 Going conventional: a critique A key perk of mainstream scholars is ample freedom to misconstrue the theoretical character of challengers. Note how constructivism is conveyed for audiences of a major IR journal where the author imposes a neat but invidious distinction between 'critical' constructivism, based on critical theory, Gramsci and Foucault, and 'conventional' constructivism, which is cleansed of unsavoury influences. Critical and conventional versions, Ted Hopf argues, share assumptions about the mutual constitution of actor and society, anarchy as a social construct, power as being both material and discursive and of interests as being variable with the context. So far, so good. Critical constructivism 'rejects either the possibility of the desirability of a minimal or contingent foundationalism' and regards 'establishing causality as an illusory goal' - which would surprise the Frankfurt critical theorists who assiduously toiled to elaborate a profoundly subtle 'materialist conception of history'.72 From the inaugural era of the Institute for Social Research through Habermas' endeavour to construct a 'universal pragmatics', practitioners of critical theory exhibited little sympathy for the 'antifoundational' bent of postmodern theorists with whom they 68 Alexander Wendt, Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 1. 69 Ibid., pp. 132,330. 70 Checkel, ' 'The Constructivist Turn', p. 326. Their approach, incidentally, stems from a frequently justified suspicion that ideas get used as rhetorical camouflage for self-interest - a gambit which, where proven, vindicates realists. Rarely noted is the opposite tack that actors motivated by ethics cast their motives in terms of self-interest in order to buttress their case before a wider and less ethically fussy audience. Yet this formulation too misses the point that high-minded ideas inevitably are interwoven with interest. 71 On the dubious practice of arriving at wise choices by 'splitting the difference', see Alexander Cockburn, Corruptions of Empire (New York: Verso, 1987), pp. 199-211. Perhaps ideas are 'distinguished from interests in that ideas-based proposals are driven by principles or values that are informed by a wider perspective on causes and effects, costs and benefits'.

But who suffers from supporting 'tax fairness' if it means that they fork out less tax or reap more services? Who suffers from opposing militarism if the result is oneself or one's children kept out of body bags? Saints are still saints but high-minded behaviour exerts an impact on material fortunes which cannot be ignored 72 Hopf, "The Promise of Constructivism', pp. 183, 198. It is the case though that from Korsch to Adorno and even up to Habermas there is a rejection of the metaphysical foundations of 'traditional theory'. All these critics, however, retain a concern with thematising the whole, whether in terms of a 'totality' (Hegel/Lukacs) or a 'constellation' (Adorno/Benjamin) of fragments. There was never a need for metaphysical foundations in order to thematise the whole: these are very different things.</page><page sequence="14">52 John Kurt Jacobsen are conflated and confused here.73 It says a great deal about the intellectual insularity of the discipline that no referee or editor had the knowledge or willingness to raise questions about this portrayal. Critical constructivism aims at 'unmasking power', which is true, while conven tional constructivism is 'analytically neutral' as to its attitude to the distribution and nature of power in any society. No scholar evidently has any reason to unmask behind-the-scenes workings and purposes of powerful agents, which is just not a neutral to do. This is exactly the spurious sort of neutrality that critical theory arose to expose. Critical theory supposedly regards 'world politics as an array of fragments that can never add up to a whole' and so deems efforts to construct such a whole as the political imposition of 'some kind of rationalised, naturalised order on irrepressible differences,' which once again muddles up critical theory with a batch of postmodern theories, such as Saussure or Derrida, intent on conducting analysis exclusively within and between texts, as ungrounded systems of signs.74 Readers are informed that conventional constructivism aims at 'production of new knowledge and insights based on real understanding' while critical construc tivists are interested in such unscientific notions as enlightenment and emancipation - and a presumption reigns here that the former task cannot legitimately be related to the latter.75 What of The Authoritarian Personality series, the Studies in Authority and the Family project of which it was part, the Studies in Prejudice series and a host of other empirical studies conducted by the Frankfurt school and later followers like Habermas, especially at the Starnberg Institute? The overarching purpose of critical theorists, as Leo Lowenthal put it, was 'to accomplish scientific ally meaningful work in a manner that would allow its application to political purposes'.76 In Horkheimer's heyday, when the psychoanalytic slant was particularly strong, the school's objective was 'to research the psychic processing of economically induced behavioural imperatives and their transformation into specific cultural meanings'.77 One hardly can come up with a more concisely stated 'constructivist' agenda, and many decades before anyone designated themselves, or were designated, as a constructivist. Hopf avers that only conventional constructivists wish to 'discover identities and their associated reproductive social practices' and offer a responsible empirical account of 'how these identities imply certain actions'. As unveiled by conventional constructivism, the power of a social practice, Hopf explains, is to 'produce inter subjective meaning within a social structure' - which rather nicely also matches up 73 See Rudiger Bubner, 'Habermas' Concept of Critical Theory', in John Thompson and David Held, Habermas (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1980), p. 50-1. 74 Hopf, 'The Promise of Constructivism', p. 199.

Did the American state under Jimmy Carter have the same 'basic character' as the American state under Nixon, or did the second Reagan administration have the same 'identity' as his first administration?80 Identity would be a very mercurial thing if the answers were all in the affirmative. Just what are the domestic and international components, and who are the agents involved, in creating (and recreating) this 'basic character'? You don't have to be a critical theorist to tell that identity 'cannot be constituted without reference to place, to conditions of existence' that help to define 'who we are' and 'what we are doing here'.81 Conventional constructivism relies on Mead's and follower Harry Stack Sullivan's view that the 'self is made up of reflected appraisals' - a zealously passive notion that is extended to the way states supposedly acquire identities. Yet utilising Sullivan's own term 'parataxic distortion,' one easily poses the scenario that, given such passivity, one's identity is likely to be composed of nothing but parataxic distortions, that is, the sum of distorted identifications in which all the deluded participants - who internalise one another's misapprehensions - consensually validate a Lewis Carroll reality.82 Hopf observes that conventional constructivists really offer no causal theory of identity construction and that critical theory is 'more advanced in this regard but it comes at a price that one may or may not be willing to pay', which is an admirably candid appraisal.83 Hopf and the conventional constructivists speak of many possible identities available for each state (a proposition that keeps scrutiny fixed at state unit level), but not of many identities - bearing diverse interests and projects competing within each state for power.84 So much for 'second image reversed' studies 78 Chantal Mouffe, 'Hegemony and Ideology in Gramsci', in Tony Bennett, Graham Martin, Colin Mercer, Janet Woolacott (eds.)

But the fact is that in a great many relationships of the most commonplace kind - with neighbors, enemies, acquaintances, and even statistically determined people as the collector and the mailman - variants of such distortions exist. The characteristics of a person that would be agreed to by a large number of competent observers may not appear to you to be the characteristics of the person toward whom you are making adjustive or maladjustive movements. The real characteristics of the other fellow at that time may be of negligible importance to the interpersonal situation. This we call parataxic distortion.'

What usually is at stake in such constructivist studies are political projects of domestic groups striving to demonstrate to dominant elites (where they do not already comprise part of these elites) that a preferred course of conduct is in their interest too. Does it really make sense to say that industrialists and bankers were 'reconstituted' in their grudging acceptance of Keynesianism and welfare state policies in the early postwar era? This was no small change, but how embedded does this liberalism appear today? In the US and UK, are corporations and banks - not to mention the state - reverting to their 'pre reconstituted' (pre-Keynesian) identities? The surface clearly is all that is being scratched by such a question. Still, what even the conventional constructivist literature usefully, if not uniquely, emphasises is that there are usually several paths - with different immediate consequences for the distributions of costs and benefits - by which to accomplish a particular goal. In assigning meaning, however, Hopf finds that conventional constructivism's amazingly hazy notion of identities and identity-formation does the analytical service of reducing uncertainty.88 The implicit interest that a critical constructivist detects here is the managerial mission to control uncertainty even when, by different criteria, uncertainty can be a 'good thing' - indicating, for example, that the range of participants and of policy choice is widening or that the governing coalition is reformulating its views to meet changed conditions. Ultimately, Hopf praises con ventional constructivism's 'nonpareil richness of the elaboration of causal/constitu tive mechanisms in any given social context' - nonpareil except for a critical constructivism rooted in critical theory. On theories of contexts For non-mainstream scholars a latent theory of contexts already is found in Gramscian studies where, as Weldes, Rupert and others have sketched, interpellation and articulation comprise the stuff of common sense, and porous lines are drawn 85 Wendt, to be fair, observes that his target is Waltzian system level theory, which he criticises at the system level, and does not want to give short shrift to domestic factors.

What are required then are mainstream counterparts with which to critically engage. Minimally, any such theory will be forced by this competition to give an account of how ideas arise from and alter social structure (and if not, why not), provide a defensible concept of causal relations regarding links between the cognitive-cultural and the socio economic spheres, demonstrate why the analyst is or is not implicated in the analysis, and what the consequences and/or remedies are. Laffey and Weldes are on the right track in saying that competing conceptions of causal relations ultimately were at stake in the ideas debate.89 They argue, as did the critical theorists, that ideas are 'inextricably embedded in material practices and other social relations because power relations are entailed in all representational practices'.90 Further, the ideological effects of representations 'are closely bound up with the contexts in which they are deployed'.91 Examining core values (which presumably form part of Weldes' 'security imaginary'), Herman adds that the use of force against an ally might be unthinkable whereas against an enemy it would be easy due to 'the image of the other actor and the norms this image defines as relevant'.92 Where the image (say, Iraq in 1989 and Iraq in 1991) springs from and why it takes the form it does, are questions that no ideational school of thought has sorted out convincingly. The critical theory/Gramscian approach scrutinises the play of organised interests always striving to gain the interpretative upper hand, propagating their views in elite circles and public forums, and seeking sympathetic decision-making sites (congres sional committees, the executive branch, the courts, regulatory agencies, and so on) in which most favourably to wage their fights. Conventional constructivism can aid us here although there remains a strong tendency, despite its avowed concern to sort out the murky process of 'mutual constitution', to weight structure over agency and, indeed, to eschew agency altogether.93 This happens because many constructivists - even some who wield critical theory or Gramscian sympathies - search for, and are captivated by, speech (linguistic) structures through which, as the notorious post modernist phrase goes, people are 'spoken'. Germain and Kenny clearly regard it as a failing that, for Gramsci, consciousness 'could not be understood independently of the exigencies of the economic sub structure'.94 Apparently, no theoretical advance is possible until released from such exigencies. Why this is necessary is not explained by authors who apparently regard the inclusion of any role for economics at all as vulgar economic determinism. Weldes in a Cuban missile crisis study succumbs to this postmodernist bent. After making much of variable meanings that can be attached, apparently at the pleasure of the authorities, to 'visceral feelings' about the discovery of the missiles, the 89 Laffey and Weldes, 'Beyond Belief,' p. 209. 90 Ibid., pp. 210. 91 Ibid., p. 211. 92 Richard K.

In the wobbly span of a single sentence the United States is endowed with a 'well-established cold war identity' but still suffers from an 'always precarious self.'95 The American state - a unitary actor, or embodied momentarily as such by Excomm - is an insecure and highly sensitive entity which nonetheless ignores Europe - also a unitary actor - which does not share the same common sense as the US about Cuban missiles, or later, Vietnam, the 'evil empire' and much else. States, funnily enough, seem able to turn identity-formation 'receptors' on or off depending on whether it seems advantageous to those in charge, or is forced upon them. Conventional constructivism's influence crowds out Gramsci here. Yet actors clearly can rise above (or sneak around) the 'security imaginary' too, as JFK clearly and fortunately did. Actors devise self-interested but plausible interpretations of changing circum stances, and promote programmatic messages to the citizenry (or those potential allies within it) to reinforce dominance or to displace that of others. People can 'reconfigure what is happening to attain their own advantage or meet their needs'.96 Indeed, as Goffman shows, even patients in total institutions elude self-identification with the roles imposed upon them by 'working the system' for forbidden advant ages.97 Of course, one should be wary of cheery portrayals of citizens as 'rascally independent decoders of texts, forever spinning off his or her own individualised forms of resistant readings'.98 As evidenced in the success of the 'political correct ness' bogeyman concocted in the 1990s, 'well-targeted money can create debates out of thin air'.99 While ideas are interpreted within the context into which they are inserted, the context itself is not an inert background although dominant groups are all too happy to portray a favourable one as 'the way the world works'. Yet all political actors 'work' their environments in light of changing circum stances and play upon the ideational elements available in their cultural contexts to protect or to advance their concerns, and are well aware that rivals do too.100 To be implemented, the 1995 Framework on Climate Control, for example, had to have different social meanings, each of which is context-dependent, but each of which may be 'essentially contested' by other parties. '[R]eports on the International Negoti ating Committee meetings directed to prepare for the first Conference of the Parties in March 1995, and that meeting itself, suggest that numerous different social mean ings still stalk the meeting halls.

The Ulster Unionist Party leader explains why the agreement fastens the six counties forever in the bosom of Britain while his republican confr?res must argue that it is instead a stepping stone to a united Ireland. Neither group is deceptive in any way that a polygraph can detect: the different contexts in which the Unionists and republicans are situated generate different interpretative possibilities and plausibility. It isn't that Unionists see in the gestalt card image two faces (as is their habit) while Sinn Fein perceives a chalice, they both comply with their audiences' views of the minimum concessions they can live with. 'Given the same measure of racial or cultural pluralism', as Price observes in South Africa, 'different contexts (especially with respect to political institutions and the distribution of resources) equal different outcomes'.102 Likewise, 'the mere exis tence of ethnic difference does not produce the politicisation of those differences'.103 Politicising ethnicity and race can take a variety of forms 'with substantially different consequences for the quality of a society's political life - particularly in regard to levels of political conflict and stability. The introduction of a socially constructionist view of cultural and quasi-cultural (race) identity has sensitised us to the role of context in the derivation of seemingly given and fixed identity.' Facets of critical theory, through the vehicle of what mainstream scholars might call an interactionist approach, can provide a conceptual bridge to investigate relations between cognitive and socioeconomic processes which retains elements of both while avoiding the excesses of either.104 As evidenced by the acceptance of conventional constructivism, mainstream studies still resist the historical materialist notion that culture 'must be finally interpreted in relation to its underlying system of production'.105 Still, there are signs that the need to examine context entails an attendant recognition that norms are 'not divorced from the material world and impervious to the activities of agents such as nation-states' - and substate actors.106 The concept of articulation can guide formulation of theories of contexts outside its original Marxian realm.107 The field is tantalisingly open since 'we have no theory for contexts, no rules for it, and no clear idea of what limits it may have'.108 Articulation, a familiar term in these pages, links 'elements which have no neces sary relation to each other' (for example, what advertising executives do for a living) and 'involves delinking or disarticulating connections in order to link or rearticulate others [and] is a continuous struggle to reposition practices within a shifting field of forces, to redefine the possibilities of life by redefining the field of relations - the context - within which a practice is located'.109 Contexts generate puzzles, which 102 Robert Price, 'Race and Reconciliation in South Africa', Politics and Society, 25: 2 (June 1997), p. 151. 103 Ibid. 104 Stuart Hall, 'Cultural Studies: Two Paradigms', in Bennett et al.

Where one goes from there will vary depending on the degree of awareness one comfortably has that these analytical procedures, and the results they yield, are value-bound too. Because you put something in context does not mean you are being critical, but if you are critical, you will put something in context. This is a difference of some importance because the sociology of knowledge, as rendered by Karl Mannheim, also puts everything in context but is mainstream-oriented. The issue here is one of reflexivity, or critique of the intersubjective context in which the subject is operating: what marks critical theory, after all, is less simply a concern with the context than its normative contestation of the context.110 Habermas' early work Knowledge and Human Interests with its emphasis on the 'ideal speech situation' (rather than his later dalliance with a universal pragmatics) projected an 'emancipatory interest' without which a contestation of the structural context becomes impossible. Only its inclusion in the equation, so to speak, makes the contextual argument critical rather than purely analytic. This, however, raises the question whether there is a place for critical theory in a mainstream unconcerned with radical political aims and norms. Palen is correct that constructivism, as rendered by Wendt, 'arrived at a definition of the task of social science that pre cludes any form of social criticism'.111 This is hardly surprising. Nonetheless, a theory of context derived from, or in dialogue with, Gramsci can enable mainstream scholars to conduct deep explorations of relations between agent and structure when sifting out the sources of policy choice. Such a dialogue would keep Gramscians and critical theorists on their toes too.112 The Gramscian/critical theory approach makes one, or should make one, exquisitely aware of the material basis of ideology, sensitive to contests to control the political context, and attunes one to the social construction of reality without capitulating to relativist drivel or a fetishism of ideas.113 One does not construct a context 'by bringing the pieces together, and showing how the pieces fit together [which is] not the same as defining the mode of that articulation, the nature of that fit'.114 Who or what else but agents, finally, can articulate this fit and these links? The links do not articulate themselves. The mainstream ideas literature tried to avoid any suggestion that ideas are manipulable entities, although at the same time it quite properly demanded stress on the role of agency. Any hint that agents employ ideas for gain was chalked up as mere or theoretically uninteresting manipulation. Yet it is always agents who put any issue 'into context' just as, in turn, it is analysts such as ourselves who put what those actors do into context too. The issue of 'elite manipul ation', and how it is treated in scholarship, is very tricky yet promising terrain for applying and appraising competing theories of contexts.

The pupils had been taught that America lost the Vietnam War because wicked protesters undermined troop morale. One may hypothesise that the more citizens accept such unchallenged beliefs, the easier life will be for national leaders and for mainstream analysts. The omitted variables are behaving themselves; the 'data' are conforming. But 'counter-elites', like this veteran, inhabit the public realm too and convey their own sober experiences. So cumulative public judgements about past foreign policy affect the 'identity' of the American State - in the form, in this case, of a Vietnam Syndrome constraining military adventures for which there was formerly carte blanche. Can scholars in or out of the mainstream realistically omit this level of analysis, this continuous and crucial conflict over situating facts in their proper contexts?116 Conclusion In mainstream IR ideational factors remained a residual factor within the dominant frameworks of analysis or else were imported in the form of a 'conventional constructivism' which is, if anything, less empirically inclined than critical theory ever was. At the height of the 1990s debate ideational approaches promised to open an analytical avenue between elites, institutions and the public realm as well as to alert scholars to the subtle political dynamics at play when elites devise public policy. Critical theory's point is that political and economic institutions are permeated with 'significations and norms' and that 'even the most discursive cultural practices have a constitutive, irreducible political-economic dimension; they are underpinned by material supports'.117 Secondly, rationality is itself a concept and so is the notion of interest, although they are not only concepts once they acquire material support and institutional expression. (Indeed, as Adorno pointed out, positivists are reluctant to acknowledge their own emergence from and relation to a particular context, which may account for their reluctance to examine contexts at all.)118 This formulation, if by no means novel, may be the key contribution that the ideas debate brought to the mainstream. 115 W.

It merely assumes that, given the information they have, they try to pursue the best available means to achieve their ends.'120 Yet psychotherapists have long strived to detect reasons behind the behaviour of psychotic patients, and therapeutic successes occurred based on this belief that patients' actions are meaningful if one tries to understand their viewpoint. If so, have psychotics evidenced forms of rationality all along? The question arises as to what, according to this elastic criterion, is not rational? What evidence do we need to decide case by case that rational choice is applicable, partially useful, or useless.121 Rational theories typically treat contexts as inert backgrounds, independent of activities under study. But the practice of analysing articulation 'does not separate the focus from the background; instead, it is the background that actually articulates the focus [and] the task is made even more difficult when the analyst is located in the context' in which he or she is working. And this is probably the hardest nut to crack. Why weren't mainstream scholars, steeped in realism, drawn more to historical materialism than idealism during the debate? It is at first glance puzzling why scholars, who usually consign ideas to the status of supplements to interest-based paradigms, opened a space for conventional constructivists who skirt so perilously along the edge of philosophical idealism. One explanation is that what unites un likely allies is that they both are fond of the fiction of the neutral scientific observer who supposedly plays no role in influencing or being influenced by the wider social system. Everything looks exquisitely 'scientific' in a positivist mode when critical theorists and their ilk are not around to chip away at that conceit. Conventional constructivists nonetheless have widened a small breach in IR, perhaps even permit ting entry of insights from other social sciences and other frameworks. Just how 'small [a] part of what constitutes interests is actually material' is a question around which conventional and critical constructivists can engage in useful dialogues.122 For mainstream IR, entering dialogues not with Marxism per se but with psychology, anthropology, and historical sociology would be a considerable step in the direction of 'interdisciplinary materialism'. A serious dialogue by both mainstream scholars and conventional constructivists with critical constructivists would be valuable for all, although each scholar will have to decide for himself or herself whether this game is worth the candle. Still, the competing constructivisms are surely in agreement when Wendt warns that the 'dependence of theory on method' becomes 'problematic if one method comes to dominate a field' inasmuch as in 'such a context, certain questions never get raised, certain possibilities never considered'.123 119 Roxanne Lynn Doty, 'Desire All The Way Down', Review of International Studies, 26: 1 (January 2000). 120 HeeMin Kim, 'Rational Choice Theory and The Third World', Comparative Politics, 30: 1 (October 1997), p. 98. 121 Stephen Walt, 'A Model Disagreement', International Security, 24: 2 (Autumn 1999). pp. 178-9. 122 Wendt, Social Theory of International Politics, pp. 114-15. 123 Ibid., p. 35.</page></plain_text>
