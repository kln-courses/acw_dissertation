The Tingyans' Ritual Life Conclusion Introduction In this study I shall explore the present situation concerning the traditional1 religious beliefs2 and practices of the Tingyans, a minority group inhabiting the western slopes of the "Cordillera Central" in Northern Philippines. At the same time I shall attempt to explain why the Tingyan traditional belief system has survived to such a considerable degree. Earlier anthropologists and missionaries, notably Fay-Cooper Cole in 1907 (1922: 295-314), Fred Eggan in 1934 und 1950 (1956: 331-339), predicted the rapid and inevitable Dominic Togni Gaioni, master of arts in cultural anthropology (1983, University of California at Los Ange- les); instructor in sociology and anthropology at Divine Word College and Clarke College, Iowa, U.S.A., from 1983-1985. - He is a member of the Anthropology Society of Philippines and the Philippine Association for Intercul- tural Development. - He carried out fieldwork in the Philippines (1975-1979); Sabah, East Malaysia (1979); West Malaysia (1980); Mexico (1981-1982); Kenya and Uganda (1984). - He published several articles on the ethno-history and culture of Northern Philippine ethnic minorities (The llocos Review 1975-1976, 1979, 1982, Vigan, Philippines). demise of Tingyan ancestral religion. Their forecast, however, turned out to be quite pre- mature. In 1955 Florencio Miliare (405^06) noted that ancestral "paganism" and "pagan wor- ship", particularly rituals related to healing and death still survived among the Tingyans of this region. He also indicated that people would resort to their traditional religious practices only after every other human remedy or Christian cere- mony had proven futile. Thirteen years after Millaré's observations, it was my turn to explore the Tingyan way of life. From 1968 to 1974 I served as a missionary in several lowland and upland Tingyan commu- nities. While stationed in the municipalities of Tayum, Peñarrubia3, Likuwan, Lakub4, and Tineg, I had the opportunity to make prelimina- ry investigations into various aspects of Tingyan culture. Most of the data used in this study, howev- er, are the result of extensive fieldwork I conducted in Tingyan territory from 1975 to 1979, while I pursued anthropological studies at the University of the Philippines in Manila. Field investigations revealed the existence of numerous, well-kept sacred grounds and frequent ritual activities not only among the relatively isolated highland villages, but even in larger lowland communities such as Gaddani (Tayum), Peñarrubia, San Quintín, Langiden, Danglás, Lagayan, and Manabo. As recently as the fall of 1979, I had the opportunity to play a 1 By traditional, I refer to the religious belief system transmitted by Tingyan ancestors through oral tradition and customary practices prior to the penetration of Chris- tianity. 2 By religious beliefs, I mean interpretations of reali- ty by reference to the ultimate structure of the universe and to its supernatural centers of power and destiny. 3 Peñarrubia is referred to as Patók by Tingyan speakers. 4 Lakub and Likuwan are also spelled Lacub and Licúan in Spanish and English records.

Traditional religion among the Tingyans of Northern Philippines is showing a remarkable tenaciousness. While some aspects of their cul- ture have undergone significant transformation, their ancestral belief system appears to change at a slower pace and indeed maintain a substan- tial degree of vitality in spite of centuries of external interference. 1. The Tingyans and Their Social Milieu The Tingyans6, who are found in almost all of the twenty-seven political divisions of the Pro- vince of Abra, constitute the larger ethnic group in only sixteen of them. Their name is derived from the Malay root word Tinggi, which means "high, mountainous, elevated, upper." The people, however, often refer to themselves as Itneg, Igimpong or Idday-as. Scholars classify them in two linguistic clu- sters: The Valley Tingyans7 and the Mountain Tingyans8. The former group was the primary focus of Cole's investigations in 1907. Today, more than ever before, this group reveals mar- ked influences from the coast, dating back to early Chinese trade in pre-Spanish times, and intensified by Christian Ilocano immigration in the last one hundred years. 6 Other spellings have been used, such as: Tinguian, Tinguianes, Tinggian. Mine follows the suggestion of C. E. Conant in Anthropos, 4.1909. 7 Valley Tingyans live prevalently in the towns and villages of San Quintín, Langide n, D anglas, Lagayan, San Gregorio, Ba-i, Bako-ok, Gaddaní, Peñarrubia, Villavi- ciosa. Abane, and Man abo. 8 Mountain Tingyans live in the municipalities of Tineg, Lakub, Malibkong, Likuwan, Ba-ay, Dagy ornan, Buklok, Sal-lapadan, Buliney, Lubo and Tubò. Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="4">384 The latter group manifests a considerable degree of affinity with neighboring groups across the Cordillera: the Bontoks, the Kalingas and the Apayaws. While the Valley Tingyans speak one rela- tively homogeneous dialect called Il-iaud, the mountain groups use ten distinct dialects: Ada- sen, Binongan, Mabaka, Gubang, Banaw, Masadi-it, Moyadan, Dawangan, Danak and Ma-eng. All Tingyans understand and many of them speak Ilocano9, the language of the domi- nant group in the northern provinces of the island of Luzon. In view of the complexities of Philippine demographic statistics it would be difficult to estimate the exact number of Tingyans relying solely on the official census. The census I conducted in 1975 revealed that Tingyan popu- lation in Abra stood at 54, 254 or 36.90 % of the total population of the province, a significantly higher figure than that given in the official census. Tingyan towns, villages, and hamlets are always located next to a river and consist of clusters of settlements, from a minimum of ten to a maximum of two hundred households. There are no men's houses and young women's dormitories among Valley Tingyans; but this pattern seems to have survived in several of the upland valleys where unmarried women often sleep together in temporarily unoccupied hous- es, and unmarried men sleep in structures called dap-ay. The men's house serves also as a village meeting place and guest house for male travel- lers. Wealth is primarily based upon the cultiva- tion of rice, which is important as food, stan- dard of value, and medium of exchange. The Valley Tingyans grow all of their rice on wet fields; the Mountain Tingyans grow most of their rice on irrigated terraces and dry mountain slopes. Gardens are planted with vegetables, tobac- co, coffee, taro, sugar cane, bananas, citrus fruits, and herbs. Both areca and coconut palms are important. Although betel is chewed less frequently now than formerly, it continues to be Dominic T. Gaioni used in many of the upland districts, especially in religious ceremonies. The only native alcoho- lic drinks are fermented sugar cane juice and rice wine. Hunting in the upland areas is still practiced as an additional source of meat, while fishing provides a source of food both for the Mountain and Valley Tingyans. Dogs, cats, pigs, chickens, goats, cattle, the prestigious water buffalo, and the horse for transportation form the list of domesticated animals in Tingyan homes. In the field of industrial arts, Tingyans engage in gold panning along the upland rivers, and simple mining activities in the mountains find increasing competition with government and private mining and timber companies. Spin- ning and weaving are done on frame looms in the lowlands and back-strap looms in the uplands by women, who also make baskets, mats, brooms, and dyes. Men produce cordage, bamboo, knapsacks, hats, fishing nets, and fur- niture out of rattan, bamboo, or wood. Women are skillfull potters, particularly in the lowland towns of Danglás, Gaddaní, and Abang, and in the upland villages of Lanék and Mataragan. Trade with lowland and coastal areas extends far back to pre-Spanish time and has increased in recent times. The opening of the Abra-Kalinga military trail during the last part of the Spanish colonial period and the establish- ment of peace pacts with Kalinga, Apayaw, and Bontok tribes prior to and during the early stages of the American occupation period increased trade and travel in both directions. Economic activities occur and are sustained by a complex system of social and biological relationships. Kinship terminology among the Tingyans is of the Hawaiian type. The system of relations is widely extended, but basically it falls under two categories: the small domestic corpo- rate group and the larger group of kindreds. These embrace close lineal and collateral kin- folks regardless of whether the connecting links are male or female. The collateral range of kinship embraces first, second and third cous- ins. In the second descending generation the genereal term for grandchild, apo, is widely extended; the same term is also applied to grandparents as in all Cordillera ethnic groups. 9 This term is also spelled lloco, Iloko and Ilokan by present day Philippine scholars. Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="5">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World 385 Ideally marriage procedures are arranged by parents through intermediaries and begin when children are still young. A bride-price (rice fields, livestock, jars, blankets, rice, beads, money) is partially paid at an early betrothal ceremony; the rest is deferred until the time of the final stages of a marriage arrangement. Monogamy has been and still is the traditional form of Tingyan marriage, but concubinage does occasionally take place. Incest taboos are broken at times by persons of higher social and economic status. Property (house, land, livestock, heirlooms) inherited by parents and acquired jointly by the spouses during the marriage is divided equally among the children. Ideally Tingyan society does not approve of divorce; this is evidenced by complex and expensive procedures purposely established to discourage such an eventuality. On the other hand, divorce does occur. If the man is held responsible, his kin must pay whatever fines the elders of the two kin groups agree upon; if it is the woman's fault, the bride-price is refunded to the man's kinfolks. Most Tingyans live in small villages (balba- layan, barangay, barrió). This fundamental political unit is headed by one or more head- men (manmanakem, lallakay) depending upon how many extended families live in the same village. A headman may extend his position of influence over a larger segment of the popula- tion depending upon such factors as: experi- ence, personality, wealth, public speaking skills, ceremonial status, and above all, the ability to settle disputes. Regional alliances between villages, towns, or ethno-linguistic groups date back at least to the Spanish times. Formerly these peace pacts (bedeng, kalon) were established primarily for the purpose of keeping peaceful relations and safe travelling and trading between two commu- nities. Today they are celebrated mainly for the purpose of fostering ethnic solidarity. With regard to social differentiation, wealth is measured in ancient jars, gongs, beads and other precious heirlooms, as well as in rice fields and livestock. To fulfill ceremonial obli- gations, or simply in order to survive, the poorer section of the population is often forced Anthropos 80.1985 to borrow rice and cash from the wealthier neighbors. These loans must be repaid with exhorbitant interest, at times up to 450 %, or by debt service, thereby reducing a segment of the community to virtual life indebtedness. The headmen interpret the traditional law (ugali or kadawyan) according to inherited customary practices. Murder is punished by blood revenge or by payment of heavy fines involving the loss of land property; stealing, by fines of water buffalo, cattle, jars, or money. Enforcement is solely by weight of the elders' consensus and public opinion. Headhunting (kayaw) between near and faraway villages was formerly endemic. But since the end of the second World War, headhunting expeditions have occurred only rarely; the few reported instances involved a very small number of individuals out to avenge the murder of kin- dred. 2. The Cosmological View of the Tingyans Anthropologist Adolf E. Jensen once stated that: "In most early forms of religion, myths and cults are closely related. Mythic perception has decisively influenced all of man's life pat- terns" (1963: 39). Mythology is a major source in providing pre-literate societies with authentic and authori- tative guidelines for social interaction, ground rules for fruitful relationship with superior beings and deities and a meaningful explanation of the universe wherein all beings find their existence. From the study of Tingyan myths there emerges a view of the universe and its inhabit- ants, which explains the basis of social behavior and moral conduct. The Tingyans' perception of this universe as expressed in their oral tradition is essentially a holistic one. To describe it as comprised of zones, regions or realms does not necessarily negate the holistic nature of Tingyan cosmologi- cal view. Plants, animals, humans, ancestors and deities all live and continuously interact in one and the same world. The ultimate picture seems to be one in which the inhabitants of the</page><page sequence="6">386 cosmos experience a de facto uninterrupted spatial and temporal unity. Given the fundamental unity of the Tingyan cosmos, we can easily cope with the fact that this society's descriptive terminology suggests a universe composed of three distinct levels for three distinct modes of existence: the face of the earth, the expanse of the heavens, and the vastness in between. Myths and beliefs indicate quite clearly that contacts occur constantly be- tween these various levels, but the Tingyans have no precise geographical or topographical concept of the spatial relations among these levels. They possess, however, a set of terms that describe quite concretely the three layered cosmos. Some Tingyans may have forgotten the mythological basis for the origin of the universe and its inhabitants, but they are all aware of their own existence, kanton labaw ta luta, here on the face of the earth. Luta is the term used by Valley and Southern Tingyans to indicate the land, the soil, the ground, the earth on which they live, work, reproduce, and die. The same term is also used by their neighbors of Northern Bontok and Southern Kalinga; various cognates can be found in many other Filipino groups. Northern and Eastern Tingyan groups prefer to use the equivalent term of pita, which they have in common with their neighbors of Northern Kalinga. In mythological accounts and ritual prayers the earth is often referred to as sudipan.10 The term manifests the view of the earth from the standpoint of the primal deities and the superior beings and is used only by shamans, ritual leaders, and storytellers. The horizontal exten- sion of the Tingyan view of the earth reaches primarily as far as their eyes can see and their feet can carry them. Through extensive trading and peace pact relationships they are aware of the existence of their westerly neighbors in the lowlands, along the sea coast, and those east of the great Cordillera range of mountains. They speak of an upstream direction (day a or surong) where Dominic T. Gaioni the rivers originate, and of a downstream region (la-ud, lagud, lod or salug) where the rivers meet the ocean. The Malay cognate, la-ut, means sea. The terms day a and la-ud are not equivalent to the western concepts of East and West, as some scholars believe, because what is West for the Tigyans is North for the Kalingas, on account of the fact that the rivers meet the sea (la-ut) West of the Tingyan territory, and in a northernly direction in respect to the Kalinga region. Similarly the head waters of Abra's rivers are located in the eastern part of Tingyan land, while the upstream region for the Kalin- gas is in the South of their territory. Most Tingyan settlements are riverine and the trails connecting them generally follow the directions of the water ways. This explains why Tingyans are concerned mostly about two of the four directions or cardinal points. The terms amyanan (translated north) and abagatan (translated south) are coastal terms and relati- vely recent linguistic importation, rarely used by the Tingyans. Their directional senses deal almost exclu- sively with the upstream and downstream regions. Tingyan mythology recognizes the exis- tence of the sea (where all the rivers meet) and have deities who live there, but in the overall picture this body of water plays a minor role in their cosmic view. They are prevalently moun- tainous (tinggi) and riverine (day a, surong) people, with another distinct ethnic group sepa- rating them from the sea. What in mythological accounts is often referred to as underworld has even less impor- tance in Tingyan folklore than the sea region. They speak of dalém ta pita, the interior of the earth, and of spirits inhabiting the under- ground, but not in terms of a cosmic region. They realize that there is a depth below the face of the earth and someone must be the custodian of it. There is, however, no concept of an underworld as a dwelling place for the spirits of the dead; that is the reason why, as we shall see, Tingyans believe that all the dead, regard- less of the way they live on earth, reside in the vastness between the sky dome and the earth; only a few privileged ones join the farthest expanse of the heavens, the realm of the primal deities. 10 Ritual terminology extends also to many Tingyan towns and villages, to the Tingyan people as a whole, and to individuals, who ritually are referred to as ipugaw. Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="7">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World 387 In this connection it may be pointed out that the Tingyans do not have a comprehensive term for their three-layered universe. This does not necessarily indicate that they fail to see the cosmological unity between the various levels of existence; the concept of a unified cosmos has just not crystallized into one collective term, but is rather expressed through a complex system of relationships between the beings inha- biting the various realms of the universe. The greatest amount of contact between the various types of beings seems to take place on earth. This is not only the dwelling place for humans and non-humans, such as plants and animals, but also the meeting place between human beings and many superior beings and primal deities, who often visit the humans in dreams, in rituals, and take part in social and economic activities. In former times deities even married humans, begot children, and lived on earth. The Tingyan cosmic view in its vertical dimension envisions first a vast intermediate region called kalawakan or maglawa. The terms actually describe the vastness, lawak, and the expanse, lawa, of the space, visible to human eyes, that stretches from the face of the earth to the dome of the sky and delimits the boundary between the sky below (kalawakan) and the invisible expanse of the heavens beyond. Kalawakan constitutes the abode of the great majority of the superior beings: the spirits of the dead, those of ancestors and mythologi- cal heroes of the ancient times as well as the astral deities of the sky. These are the spirits which often enter into contact with humans and relate to them in a great variety of ways. The third layer of the Tingyan universe is referred to as gullangitan or simply as langit. This term exists in all the languages of the South East Asian archipelago and is usually translated as sky or heaven. To render the precise connotation of this term within the cosmic vision of Tingyan thinking, I prefer to describe it as the expanse of the heavens above the sky dome. This is the abode of the primal deities, who have always existed and of those few human beings who obtained the privilege to live there through their marriage to the deities or through a particularly noble way of life. To speak of a heaven where good is reward- Anthropos 80.1985 ed after death or a hell where evil will be punished or any other world distinct from or hostile to the three-layered world would not be consistent with the cosmological view of the Tingyans. On the face of the earth they see a world with the village at the center and a horizon gradually expanding like concentric cir- cles to include their valley, the river, the rice fields, the swidden farms, the forest, the moun- tains, their neighbors in the upstream and downstream regions, all the way to the ipus di danum, the tail of the water, where the river meets the sea. From a vertical point of view the Tingyans see a three layered cosmos, inhabited by non-humans, humans and supra-humans. Much of the interaction between the various types of beings occurs on earth; the sky below the dome is not a place of punishment for the less than perfect majority, but rather a lower heaven where humans with superior powers, in the company of celestial beings who inhabited the region from the very beginning, continue the same style of life they conducted on earth, except for death. The sky above the dome is thought of as an upper heaven where the primal deities and a few other privileged beings live in splendid isolation, relatively unconcerned with the affairs of the world below. 3. The Tingyan Pantheon Tingyans today, more than seventy-five years after Dr. Fay-Cooper Cole's observations, are still being taught by their elders that a great multitude of spirits surround them, some of them good, some malevolent; some of them communicating with humans quite often, others almost never (Cole 1922: 295). Adolf E. Jen- sen, talking about primitive peoples, made a statement which applies quite accurately to the present situation in Abra. He said that "in many communities there is hardly a person who has not had in the course of his life some encounter with a spirit which he can accurately describe. Spirits appear not only in dreams, although dream encounters are the most fre- quent source of experience; they are occasional- ly seen in broad daylight; and one may have the</page><page sequence="8">388 most varied kinds of contact with them" (Jen- sen 1963: 296). Tingyans believe in a pantheon of spirits and no shaman or elder really knows how many of them inhabit the universe. Dr. Fay-Cooper Cole counted one hundred and fifty of them (1915: 26) but, given the great variability be- tween village and village and from one shaman to another, the number is potentially limitless. Tingyan society did not develop a caste of theological specialists capable of presenting a neat and systematic view of their belief system. The apparent vagueness is actually perceived as a positive feature with the precise function of affording the shaman greater freedom in the interpretation of intercosmic experiences. There is no event in the life of a community or of an individual that a shaman cannot explain by reference to the ultimate structures of the universe and its centers of supernatural power. While all informants agree in the existence and importance of superior beings and deities, there is a bewildering variety of interpretations as to the specific characteristics of the invisible beings. Names, ranks, powers, personalities, appearance, the type of relationship superior beings have among themselves and with the mortals, may or may not change from valley to valley, from one Cordillera tribe to another. Tingyans recognize two categories of spirits and deities; those who have always existed in their present status and those who have achiev- ed their spiritual prerogatives and superior power after living and dying first as common mortals on earth. The uncreated spirits could be classified in three categories on the basis of their dwelling place within the universal order: those who live in the gullangitan, those who inhabit the kalawakan, and those who surround humans by owning, guarding, controlling and living in the forces of nature on the face of the earth, the pita. The created spirits of deceased mortals all live in the lower heaven except for a very few privileged ones who were assumed into the upper heaven on account of their marital relations with the primal deities. Dominic T. Gaioni a) The Deities of Gullangitan On the basis of Cole's findings and according to my informants seventy-five years later, Kadak- lan still lives and reigns in the highest part of the heavens. The name of this primal deity signifies that he is "the greatest" as the absolute superlative form of the adjective dakkel clearly indicates. Kadaklan is a powerful male deity who created the earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars; but many informants do not mention him as the origin of humans and lesser spirits. He does communicate with human beings through dreams, appearances, and atmospheric pheno- mena. In ancient times, he made one of his rare earthly appearances to marry Agemem who bore him two sons. While some shamans and informants think of him as a distinct unique deity, others point out that he is the same divinity invoked under the name of Bagatulayan. The following ritual invocation could indeed be interpreted in both ways: "awan ta dakdakkel ngem si Kadaklan; aw an ta naturturay ngem si Bagatulayan." "None is greater than Kadaklan; no one is more powerful than Bagatulayan. "n This latter deity has not been recorded by Dr. Cole, but I have heard many ritual leaders pronounce his name, and elders have used the name in simple con- versations. Bagatulayan is believed to be one of the primal deities living in the upper sky from where, as his name suggests, he rules over the universe and watches over the mortals on earth. His name emphasizes the ruling power he pos- sesses, the giver of the ugali or kadawyan, the custom law that guides human behavior on earth and maintains the order and harmony of the entire universe. This conclusion could be inferred from the statements of some infor- mants who said that whoever goes against the laws of Bagatulayan will be subject to sickness, hardships, sufferings and even death. On the other hand, he is not a tyrannical ruler and bestows his mercy upon those who sincerely call 11 Information obtained from elders Binong Agaid, Lippago, Basingan, and ritual leaders La-ayan and Mala- tag, all of Peñarrubia, Abra, in 1979. Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="9">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World 389 upon him. The root word of his name is tur ay or tulay which expresses the concept of authority and the power to rule over the entire cosmos. Once again I found disagreement among my informants as to Bagatulayan's identity. Some conceive him as an autonomous deity; others believe he is just merely another aspect of Kadaklan 's divine personality. The third most important divine being in the pantheon of the Tingyans is referred to as Kabuniyan. He is by far the most beloved and revered of the primal deities of Abra and indeed of all the tribes of the entire Cordillera region of Northern Luzon. His name stems from the root word buni12 meaning prayer, ceremony, ritual, or worship. Agbubuni is to perform a ritual; managbubuni indicates the ritual practitioner; Kabuniyan, therefore, could be understood as the source and object of men's ritual activity. Informants and mythical literature concord in describing Kabuniyan as a friendly, loving, merciful, and compassionate deity. He lives in gullangitan with the other primal beings, but in the ancient days he either came or was sent by Kadaklan to earth on behalf of mankind. He married Ginnalingan from Makudkudrá, a vil- lage in the district of Patók. Tingyans of other districts, though, disagree with this version and claim that the fortunate lady hailed from their respective areas. What is more important is the common belief that Kabuniyan was the great helper, teacher, provider, and ritual initiator of the Tingyans of ancient times. He taught them how to plant and harvest rice and how to cultivate the sugar cane. Together with his wife Ginnalin- gan he instructed the people of the earth about how to defend themselves against the influence of malevolent spirits and how to offer the right prayers for imploring the mercy of Kadaklan and Bagatulayan. In this connection he also taught them how to make the necessary cere- monial paraphernalia such as the gongs {gansa), the precious beads (batek), the ceremonial drinks of rice wine (tapey) and sugar cane wine (basi). This ceremonial role, describing him as the origin, the source, and the founder of Tingyan ritual life, explains more forcefully than anything else the deepest meaning of Kabuniyan's name. In spite of Kabuniyan's great love for man- kind, mythical information tells us that some inhabitants of the earth plotted against him and his wife. Poisoned sugar cane wine was served to them; but the evil plan was unsuccessful because Kabuniyan, using his divine preroga- tives, disappeared from the face of the earth and has seldom been seen since. Some infor- mants say that on those rare occasions when he visits the earth, he appears under the semblance of a giant of immense proportions, carrying his enormous spear and head-axe. Just as in the previous cases, there are many indications that Kabuniyan is at times identified with, or thought of as equal to, the other primal deities, especially Kadaklan. But there is no question that for the Tingyans he is the most well known and the most popular of the divine inhabitants of gullangitan. This interpretation is also strongly supported by the beliefs of the neighboring tribes. In the Provinces of Kalinga, Bontok and Benget, Kabuniyan is portrayed either as the supreme being of the heavens or as one of the highest deities. In the province of Ifugaw only, Kabuniyan is the name of one of the abodes of the deities; but even in this case the term Kabuniyan is clearly related to the belief system of the Cordillera tribal cluster. To conclude this discussion on the triad of primal deities living in the expanse of the heavens, it may be pointed out that, according to the various informants, its rich identity can be interpreted in at least three ways: first, the triad can be conceived as being one and the same deity, called by various names, depending on which of its attributes human beings wish to emphasize. Secondly, the triad is made up of three autonomous, distinct, but related divine entities, with one being supreme. Thirdly, the triad can be seen as a collectivity of primal beings (a dema-deity in Jensen's sense) wherein all of them share the same rank. Personally, I am convinced that my Tingyan informants would accept and feel comfortable with any of the three interpretations. This is borne out not only by the fact that these views 12 The term buni has been adopted into the Christian rite of Baptism, which is referred to as bunyag. Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="10">390 do exist among the various groups of the Cor- dillera, but especially because the Tingyans ultimately are not concerned with the question of whether their concept of god is monotheistic, polytheistic, or triadic. They are satisfied with the notion that in the universe there are supe- rior beings and primal deities with various degrees of contact with human beings on earth. Through strategies, dedicated by custom law, all the inhabitants of the universe must maintain the cosmic order, which gives meaning to all forms of non-human, human, and supra-human existence. In conducting research work we must real- ize the limitations we encounter in approaching the realm of the spirits of cultures which view the world and its inhabitants from a different perspective. It is evident that Kadaklan, Baga- tulayan, and Kabuniyan have supra-human characteristics; we can define them as primal deities, supreme beings, perhaps even as gods. We cannot, however, find an all encompassing native term behind the concept of deity, appli- cable to all these supernatural beings. The term Dios which Tingyans use is of clear Spanish derivation. They use it in a Christian context but not in relation to their ancestral beliefs. Here they prefer the term Apo, applied to both male and female deities. Apo is generally translated as Lord and is always followed by the proper name of the deity; but what is most important is the fact that this term is applied to all superior beings living in gullangitan, in kalawakan, and on the pita. Furthermore, it is also the term used in the Tingyan kinship system for the grandparental and grandchildren generations. The term, therefore, expresses a relation- ship between the visible beings {ta-o a makita) and the invisible beings {ta-o a di makita) which is comparable to the relationship among kin- dreds on earth. This interpretation is in perfect agreement with the unified cosmic view of the Tingyans and with their understanding of the life of the superior powers. They are beings like us and conduct their affairs more or less as we do on earth; but they are invisible and possess superior powers, which man tries to control through magic and ritual practices. Dominic T. Gaioni b) The Superior Beings of Kalawakan In the cosmic view of the Tingyans, the number of deities increases as we leave the abode of the primal and most powerful beings and descend towards the earth. In the vast expanse of Kalawakan, live the astral spirits of the sun, Apo Ink or Sinag; the moon, Apo Bulan; and the stars, Apo Bitbitwen. They were created by Kadaklan for the sake of human beings on earth. They are good spirits and do not need to be appeased or controlled by sacrificial offer- ings and prayers. A second group of deities living in this region could be classified as the spirits in control of the atmospheric phenomena, such as the wind, Angin; the breeze, Bay on; the thun- der, Kidol or Kido-ol; the lightning in the sky, Kimat or Salit; the lightning from the earth, Kilawit; the rain, Degges or Udan; the rainbow, the clouds and others. These are particularly feared on account of the destructive power which they sometimes exhibit during the rainy season; yet they do not seem to receive much ritual attention. The largest group of superior beings inhab- iting kalawakan and by far the most important of the three categories in terms of their rela- tionship to the humans are the spirits of the recently dead and those who died long ago, such as the ancestors of the mythical period. The traditional belief system of the Tingyans does not envision any underworld for the evil or paradise for the good souls. The soul, kalading or kararuwa or kalkalma, of the dead is thought to be in the form and essence similar to a human being. Existence in the beyond closely duplicates the ways of the living on earth. This spiritual reality sometimes abandons for a while the human body even during this earthly existence and thereby causes insanity; for this reason a ritual, ud-udong, is performed among the Valley Tingyans to implore its return. After death, the souls of the dead join the rest of the spirits, the Anito13, in the world of 13 Anito is a common term widely used in Malay South East Asia, referring to the spirits in general, or those of the dead in particular. Other cognates are: Anitu, Anutu, Hantu, Antu. Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="11">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World 391 kalawakan. There is much confusion and even contradiction as to the clear identity of these Anito beings. Some informants plainly state that they are the spirits of the dead; others identify them with the deities that live on earth, in rivers, mountains, forests, plants, animals, and other natural phenomena. Still others agree with the vague statement of Dr. Fay-Cooper Cole that "Anito is a general term used to designate members of the spirit world" (1922: 301). This variety of opinions is not surprising, because it reflects the situation ethnologists have found in the entire South East Asian archipelago. What we can safely state is that Anito is a term applied to spirits living in a type of existence without the presence of an earthly body; they possess powers humans do not have and are the major recipients of a very elaborate set of ritual activity. Ceremonies are addressed to them either because they are thought of as being evil or as having the power to cause evil, such as illness or death, on human beings. These misfortunes occur especially when human beings advertently or inadvertently violate the domains of the Anito on earth. These spirits, like the primal deities, can take the form and shape they wish and appear directly to human beings. More often they appear as ghosts, al-alyá, in the night or communicate through dreams and omens or by taking possession of the body of another person. This is what happened in 1972 among the Lakub Tingyans. One of the brightest high school students was believed to have been possessed by the spirit of a male student who had drowned in the river a few years earlier. The behavior, the voice, the words of the young medium revealed the identity of the spirit com- municating through her. c) The Superior Beings Living on Earth The cosmic region most closely associated with man's birth, growth, reproduction, and death is the face of the earth, the luta or pita. The Tingyans realize they live on a very productive, friendly and beneficial earth, and often honor it by referring to it as Ina nga daga, Mother-earth. Anthropos 80.1985 Mother-earth is a great spirit; she literally supports their village, the center of their cosmo- logical view, the river, the spring, the fields, the hills, the mountains, the forests, the trees, the plants, the birds, and everything that helps them through life. All these elements, which make up the environment surrounding Tingyan life, are the domain of a host of spirit beings, at times benevolent, at times malevolent, which greatly condition all aspects of Tingyan society. These spirits are generally called Anito, but many of them are invoked or spoken of with their proper names. Similar to the spirits living in kalawakan, they possess superior powers and are the objects of very intense ritual activity. They are many; some say hundreds, some say thousands. Dr. Fay-Cooper Cole counted 150 of them; some other anthropologists, like R. F. Barton, working in a neighboring region, listed more than one thousand of them. All infor- mants agree that nobody knows how many spirits there are. I will, therefore, limit myself to a classification of the most commonly known spirits and some of their names, to prove once again that the belief system of the Tingyans is tenaciously resisting the influence of modern acculturation. The most visible sign of their belief in spirits is the presence of shrines located next to the main trail at one of the entrances, pudayan, of the villages. The shrine and the adjacent ritual grounds are identified with a variety of names: pinpina-ing or pinading or ab-abay by the Val- ley Tingyans; sangasang, kabaga-an, papattay- an, bawbaw-wi, or kalkalapaw by the mountain groups. The shrine in the uplands is a small minia- ture hut made of stone, wood, or metal sheets, large enough to contain two or three bowls for the offerings, and sometimes two or more vaguely anthropomorphic stones, considered sacred by the people. In the lowlands the sacred or "guardian" stones, as Cole calls them, are not protected by any structure, but they are strategically placed at the foot of a particularly awesome-looking tree, usually a balete (ficus ben j amina). Cole reports that a spirit called Apdel resides in the village shrine. Informants do not always agree on the name or the number of spirits living in the village shrine. In Penami-</page><page sequence="12">392 bia I was told that pinpina-ing is the very name of the spirits living there; but in the Buklok and Ikmin river valleys this is the name of spirits living in the forest. In Dulaw an elder told me that the spirits living in the shrine are collective- ly called Labon, which means abundance, but in Mataragan during a ritual in 1970 the shaman informed the community that the spirits of the shrine were Gimbangonan, one of the names of the wife of Kabuniyan; Imagtanongan, a helpful male spirit; Ibabakudan, a protective female spirit; and Ibibilian, a female spirit guarding against enemy raids. I believe it is accurate to say that the shrine serves as an outward symbol of the protective presence of the benevolent elements of the spirit world. They guard the village against the malevolent forces; this role is often symbolized by the presence of small miniature shields and gates with bamboo spikes surrounding the sac- red stones. Various benevolent spirits are called upon by the shaman to come and inhabit the shrine, depending on the purpose of the cere- mony and the needs of the community. Outside the village the Tingyans believe in the presence of spirits almost everywhere, and in everything animate and inanimate. There are spirits in the rivers, Idadanum, who sometimes appear as mermaids trying to snatch people away; spirits of the sea, Inawen; of the moun- tains, Ibanbantay; of the plains, Idatag; and of the rice fields, Kaiba-an, for whom Tingyans deposit offerings in bamboo baskets called atang in the lowlands, and sallukong in the uplands. There are spirits connected with hunting activities, such as the lord of the hunting dogs, Sabi-an, the lord of the wild deer and hogs, whose name is Sannadan in many places, and Pitulok in Bawyan, a dependency of Buliney. Hunters in pursuit of wild game play a musical instrument, the mouth bow, called tabankaw. Pitulok enjoys so much the sound of this instru- ment that he forgets to guard his domain, thereby permitting the hunters to succeed in their endeavors. There are spirits who help humans to achie- ve positive goals, such as making friends, find- ing the cause of village problems, giving good omens, attending and preventing quarrels and Dominic T. Gaioni drunkenness during festivals. There is even one who helped Dr. Cole learn a Tingyan dialect. The largest group of spirits seems to be those who attend, or are invited to participate in, religious ceremonies. Shamans, in every ceremony I have attended, called upon and often were possessed by a large number of spirits whose names were always different. The most feared of them is a class of spirits that cause illness to humans, such as headaches, sore feet, stomach aches, and interferes with mortu- ary practices. Selday steals dead peoples' bodies. Akup is always trying to embrace widows in mourning. Kumaw expects children to be sacrificed, especially in the construction of bridges. Alan is the meanest of them all; he can appear under all kinds of forms and shapes; but usually he is believed to be a giant with ten heads, always present at funeral occasions, try- ing to snatch corpses away. In 1969 while visiting Lapât, Tineg, I remarked to the local teacher that a young man, standing there in the village yard, was as tall as a giant. He under- stood that I was comparing him to Alan. He took it as a grave insult and we had quite a problem in clarifying the misunderstanding. The Ibuwa are also numbered among the enemies of mankind. They live next to burial grounds trying to steal dead bodies; for protec- tion the Valley Tingyans place a piece of iron or an iron plow on the tombs; this device is believed to keep the Ibuwa away. The cosmic view of the Tingyans would not be perfect and complete without the spirits who inhabit the two main terrestrial regions: the upstream region where all the rivers originate is the domain of Idadaya who has ten grandchil- dren symbolizing the entire Tingyan watershed; the downstream region is the abode of lord Inginlaud. In spite of some conflicting interpretations, the picture Tingyan informants give about their cosmos and its inhabitants is quite a compre- hensive one. There is a society of humans on earth which is in relatively close contact with the superior beings inhabiting the other levels of the cosmic existence. These contacts are based upon ancient customary laws given by the primal deities which all beings are bound to obey in order to maintain the cosmic order. Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="13">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World 393 Custom laws nothwithstanding, the relationship between human and supra-humans at times is positive, at times negative in nature. But what- ever the case, the behavior of spirits and deities influences the social, economic, biological and religious life of the Tingyans. In their effort to maintain or reestablish order in the cosmos and smooth relationship among its inhabitants, Tin- gyans engage in extensive ritual activity. 4. The Tingyans9 Ritual Life The Spanish chroniclers during the early period of the Philippine conquest were impressed nei- ther by the natives' social organization nor by their belief system. They thought the Filipinos of the 16th century had no king, no temples and a very simple form of religion consisting of a "few superstitious" practices. It did not take a very long time, however, for those new masters to realize that native beliefs were more complex than they thought and deeply rooted in the social fabric. Efforts were not spared, including the use of force, to convince the Indio popula- tion to abandon their ancient beliefs. The masses soon learned how to keep those few practices a community secret, and above all devised the strategy to perform them away from the disturbing presence of colonial church and state representatives. For more than three hundred years tradi- tional animistic practices, while fully surviving in the unconquered upland regions of the archi- pelago, became a back yard religion in the coastal regions where Spanish control was effec- tive. At the arrival of the Americans it was thought that a systematic and modern educa- tional approach would finally wipe out the remnants of those "few superstitious" beliefs. At least this was prophesized by Dr. Fay- Cooper Cole and Dr. Fred Eggan. The fact is that those beliefs and practices are still resisting the forces of change; this can only bring us to the logical conclusion that this sort of belief system gives meaning to their existence, supports their quest for the satisfac- tion of basic needs, and is deeply rooted in their social organization. Anthropos 80.1985 My predecessors in the field probably underestimated either the nature or the impor- tance of traditional religious phenomena in societies such as the Tingyans. But it is actually surprising that even today many otherwise high- ly educated church and state officials, who have been residing for long periods of time in Tingy- an territory, seem unable to realize the extent to which religion pervades all aspects of Tingy- an world view and behaviour. It happened more than once that, during my almost twelve years among the Tingyans, while one set of officials was performing its rites at the local municipal hall or at the Christian temple, another set of leaders was conducting its own ancient rites in the back yards of those very buildings. These phenomena indicate the existence of social forces still beneficial and meaningful to Tingyan society. The study of social phenomena such as religion through the recording of folk-lore material entails an enormous amount of time and patient interviewing, even in the case of a researcher who knows the local dialects fairly well. It is a painstaking, but necessary, task to solicit explanations from informants about their people's world views and religious conceptions. I found this aspect of social investigation, inter- esting as it is, often frustrating and not always enjoyable, perhaps because here one deals with a deeper and understandably more difficult level of investigation; the exploration of the mind and the soul of the Tingyan way of life. What I never failed to enjoy in my field- work has been the observation and often the participation in those aspects of the Tingyan belief system that are subject to empirical and immediate scrutiny. I am referring here to the ritual life of the Tingyans, with its shrines, its practitioners, its ceremonies, wherein an entire community seems to periodically regenerate itself through contact with the mysterious world of the spi- rits. a) Shrines and Shamans The most interesting and very often the only permanent religious structure visible to the eyes</page><page sequence="14">394 of a trained researcher in a Tingyan settlement is the pin-pinaing, the village shrine. Protected, as it usually is, by the tropical foliage of a large bamboo, mango, or a balete tree, its existence is know only to the villagers and to the rare, inquisitive anthropologist. The shrine is the center of ritual activity; almost every ceremony begins and ends here. Its appearance, however, is not impressive: only a few casually arranged stones, sometimes covered by a small hut-like structure, sometimes protected only by a tree's branches. The stones are considered sacred, and so are the immediate premises surrounding the tree. The area de facto constitutes a sacred grove, the official ritual ground of the settle- ment. Villagers passing by on the way to the fields or to the forest walk with respect, aware of stepping on sacred soil and of being in the presence of a shrine believed to be the abode of powerful beings, protectors of the village life. During my stay in the Province of Abra, I visited almost every Tingyan hamlet: from Anayan in the North to Dilong in the South, from Buwanaw in the East to Kabaruyan, the gate of Abra, in the West. My findings reveal that in every municipality there is at least one village shrine; this includes those municipalities where Tingyans constitute a small minority such as Tayum with the Tingyans village of Gaddani, Dolores with the Tingyans of Malaylay, Pilar with the Tingyan settlement of Pátad, and San Isidro with the Tingyan village of Tangbaw. The only two municipalities where I did not find any village shrine are those of Bangued, the capital of the province, and of Pidigan where Father Bernardo Lago almost caused an uprising by throwing the sacred stones into the Abra River in 1823 (Schmitz 1964: 98). The Tingyan municipality of Peñarrubia (Patók), which has a common border with the two previously mentioned, has ten shrines, five of them in settlements along the provincial road. The municipality of Tineg, the farthest, most isolated and forsaken section of the pro- vince, has eleven spirit shrines. What is most noteworthy in my findings is the survival of ritual structures and concomitant activities among the Valley Tingyans, who either live side by side with or are surrounded Dominic T. Gaioni by a larger population of, hispanized Ilocanos. A certain number of animistic practices occur also in Ilocano villages but not in the same degree as in the Tingyan communities. This tenacious resistance to change has also been attributed to centuries of antagonism be- tween the two ethnic groups during the Spanish regime (Cole 1922: 245) and, in recent times, has been exacerbated by ambivalent political policies and ecclesiastical neglect. Religious beliefs and practices do not survive without a minimal number of practitioners who can keep all the sacred groves of Abra in operation. While it is true, as I have mentioned earlier, that in some settlements with shrines there is no ritual personnel and the inhabitants avail them- selves of the services of shamans from other towns or even from neighboring provinces, the overall picture does not indicate a short term shortage of religious practitioners. Shamans, Baglan, Mandadawak, Alopag, Anglebang, are usually female individuals who first experience a call, confirmed in a dream by omens, or through the act of being possessed by a superior being. They are subsequently trained through a process of apprenticeship in the chanting and reciting of the necessary prayers, diams, the knowledge of the names and charac- teristics of the various superior beings, especial- ly those adversely affecting human existence. Through practice they learn the use of ritual paraphernalia and the exact procedure for the fruitful and valid performance of a ritual. Most often the shaman is also a healer treating the sick in both spirit and body; she may also be, but rarely so, an interpreter of omens and dreams, a chanter of oral tradition, and an administrator of customary law. In the course of my investigations I have personally interviewed twenty-four shamans throughout the province, one male and twenty- three female, whom the people consider experts in the matter. I have also talked with countless others who do preside over minor ceremonies and perform other important functions in the life of the community. In Tingyan society sha- mans are not the only type of religious person- nel. All those individuals who have specific roles not only in relation to ritual celebrations, but also to healing, to augury, to the interpreta- Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="15">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World 395 tion of dreams, to the transmission of oral tradition, and to the ordering of society are considered sacred. They all act as channels between the world of immediate experience and the spirit world. One or more of these functions can be vested in the same person; individuals with specific roles constitute the leadership necessary to sustain and perpetuate the entire structure of Tingyan society; all of them play a part in the religious life of the community, but the shaman naturally retains the primacy in this sphere; only she has the privilege to achieve perfect union with the superior beings and deities. She appears to be the great link in the vertical (spiritual) dimension of that go-between system, (panagbabaet), which is an indispens- able element in Malay cultures for the mainte- nance of smooth relations at the horizontal (social) level. b) Shaman's Finitions Her functions in every major phase of the ritual performance can be summarized in the follow- ing manner: 1. She leads the community in calling the spirits; 2. she is the vehicle through which the spirits manifest themselves to the community; 3. she is the instrument of the community in a dialogue with the spirits; 4. she reveals the names of the spirits, thereby giving the community the possibility to sha- re in the spirits' power; 5. she represents the community at the sacred feast with the spirits. In the performance of these duties the shaman is helped by female, companions, espe- cially in the preparation of the necessary para- phernalia, and by male companions in the preparation of the victim, which usually consists of a pig or a chicken. A ceremonial cloth, herbs, betel nut, cook- ed rice, bamboo, porcelain plates and bowls, baskets, sugar cane wine, coconut shell contai- ners, coconut oil, a knife or an axe, ancient beads, gongs and drums are some of the most Anthropos 80.1985 common paraphernalia necessary for the proper performance of every ritual. The celebration generally begins at the village shrine with the anointing of the guardian stones; all who are not present for this anoint- ing must gather at the nearby village square. The entire affair evolves around an altar-like structure , the ap-appayag, set up in the center of the yard. c) Ritual Procedures The rituals I have observed were performed on the basis of the following procedure: 1. The calling of the spirits This event takes place through the sound of gongs, drums and the shaman's dancing, through the smell of sacred herbs and through the use of colorful tools and decorations, espe- cially red objects. 2. The coming of the spirits The superior beings share their power with the shaman by entering her body and taking posses- sion of her faculties. 3. The talking with the spirits Here the shaman plays a dual role. She repre- sents the community in her dialogue with the superior beings; she can do so because, by being possessed, she shares an equal rank with the spirits. She represents the spirits in the transmission of their request to the community; she does so in plain words or through the chanting of myths, prayers and incantations. 4. The naming of the spirits The shaman proclaims the names and attributes of the spirits. Knowledge of the spirits' names guarantees a share in their power and thereby secures their help in achieving the goals of the celebration. 5. The feasting with the spirits This phase includes the sacrifice of the animal, as a response to the spirits' favorable disposi- tion, the meal between the spirits and the shaman/community which symbolizes and guar-</page><page sequence="16">396 antees the survival of the individual and the society; and the dancing of the spirits with the shaman/community which symbolizes the rees- tablishment of harmony within the spiritual and social dimensions of society. This outline of a typical ritual celebration clearly indicates that the Tingyan belief system has the function and the ability to help a community in the achievement of basic goals. Solidarity with the spirit world is reestab- lished; kinship bonds are strengthened; leader- ship roles are reaffirmed; the economic survival of the society is reassured; the cycle of life can go on again. d) Classification of Rituals The rituals I have witnessed and recorded seem to be related to the entire gamut of basic needs the people encounter from birth to death. At every moment in life a Tingyan can call upon an authoritative system of beliefs and practices that will sustain his want for food, shelter, reproduc- tion, health, smooth social relations and spiritu- al protection. Ritual activity permeates every facet of their lives and confirms the generally held belief among students of anthropology that the various elements of culture actually form a unified and consistent whole. On the basis of this perspective the seventy- three ceremonies I have recorded throughout Tingyan Abra, from 1970 to 1979, may be classified under the following five major catego- ries: 1. Life cycle rituals This category contains two of the most elabo- rate ceremonies in the ritualized world of Tin- gyan religion: the marriage, pakalon or belay, and the mortuary rituals of bagongon and waksi or layog. Two other rites of passage, which are connected with birth and child-betrothal, ba-ag or tañí or tangpá, are fast disappearing; in those places where they still survive, they are not celebrated with the same solemnity and expen- diture of material resources as the marriage and mortuary rites are. Dominic T. Gaioni 2. Curing rituals This is perhaps the richest category both in terms of the geographical range of the ritual activity and in terms of the frequency of occur- rence. Tingyans have a ceremony for every possible type of physical and mental sickness a human being can experience through the influ- ence of malevolent spirit beings. The intense activity in this field is probably in direct proportion to the lack of modern medical assistance and to a large number of widespread diseases, such as tuberculosis, ulcer, asthma, child ailments, cough, fever, head- aches. 3. Construction rituals These are ceremonies intended to secure the protection of the superior powers, to whom ultimately all property belongs, for the con- struction of some elements essential to the physical survival of the individual and society: a new house, a new rice field, a new swidden farm, a new rice storage, or a new village shrine. 4. Agricultural rituals This category is closely connected with the previous one; both could almost be classified together, if it were not for the fact that rituals relating to a first time performance of certain social and economic activities are believed to constitute, by many scholars, a unique trait within Philippine culture. Agricultural rituals concentrate overwhelmingly on obtaining rain and a good harvest. 5. Intensification rituals This class includes a number of expensive and elaborate ceremonies that only the wealthiest families or the entire village can afford to organize. Some of the ceremonies last from three days to one week; a considerable amount of food distribution is necessary for the protracted feeding of guests gathered to celebrate a peace pact, bedeng or kalon, the arrival of a new member of the community or an important visitor, cangili, and the conclusion of an offi- cial's term of office, punsyon, pabonar, and sakyat, after which the former of ficai acquires Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="17">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World 397 the right to be addressed with the title Kapitän. All these rituals are celebrated with the inten- tion of renewing and strengthening social rela- tions within a given society (punsyon, pabonar, and sakyat), between two tribes (bedeng), or for the purpose of integrating a newcomer into the life of the community (pangili). The classification of ritual activity into various categories is actually only a useful academic exercise. The specific characteristics of each type of ritual are actually present in all forms of ceremonial activity. Whether a com- munity celebrates a marriage, the building of a house, the end of the harvest, the election of a new town official, or a ritual to procure the health of a member, all the phenomena that bring about and fortify the basic physical, psy- chological, and socio-economic needs of the society are present, interacting and observable. e) A Brief Description of Some Tingyan Rituals 1. Sangasang: The renewal of the village shrine This ritual was recorded on January 1, 1970, among the Mabaka Tingyans of Pakged, Mata- ragan, Abra. The spirits of the shrine informed a promi- nent elder of the community, through dreams, of their plan to deny protection to the village and its agricultural activities. A celebration, in which the entire community was obliged to attend, followed. The shaman, her attendants, and elders led the proceedings, during which the customary paraphernalia were utilized: musical instru- ments, ritual herbs symbolizing abundance for the harvest and thriftiness for the community, leaves, shrubs, porcelain ware, an axe, the altar-like structure in the center of the village yard , adorned with a series of objects symboliz- ing both the world of the living and the dead and, most importantly, the victim for the sacrifi- ce, a large pig. The ritual proceeded in the usual manner: the calling of the spirits through music and dance, participated in only by the ritual leaders and a few elders; the coming of the superior Anthropos 80.1985 beings, symbolized by the state of trance mani- fested in the shaman; the dialogue with the spirits in which the shaman became the bridge between the community and the celestials; the tension-charged moment of the revelation of spirits' names and their attributes, a sign that the ritual was bringing forth the expected results; and finally the feasting, with the slaying of the victim, as a response to the spirits' request, the sacred meal, and the dance in which the entire community could finally parti- cipate. The Sangasang ceremony brought about not only the renewal of the village shrine but also the regeneration of the society at the social and economic levels. 2. Pin-pinaing: A ceremony to ensure the success of a pangili (welcoming ceremony) This ceremony was recorded in Dumayko, Peñarrubia (Patók), Abra, on December 9, 1978. The Madrigal Singers of the University of the Philippines in Manila were invited to come to Abra to perform. To ensure the success of their visit and to welcome them, a ceremony was organized in the village of Dumayko. I have recorded the occasion with a series of slides, showing first the religious practitioner, Julio Kamunay, leading the ceremonies at the shrine's compound and then the community's celebration at the village central square. All the main phases of a ritual were obser- ved - from the invocation of the village guard- ian spirits through the sound of musical instru- ments and prayers, to the revelation by the practitioner, after studying the viscera of the slain animal, that the spirits were present and looked favorably upon the occasion. This was followed by the common meal and community dance in the village yard. The only important feature that did not occur in this ritual was the taking possession by the spirit of the body of the practitioner. One informant explained that not all the ritual leaders are shamans, who are the only ones who have the privilege to enter in such intimate union with the spirits; there are other practioners who can offer prayers, magdi- diam, to the spirits and to Kabuniyan, conduct rituals and obtain healings, and interpret myste-</page><page sequence="18">398 rious announcements during the shaman's trance without experiencing ritual ecstasy. 3. Kanyaw: A ritual for rain This ceremony was recorded in the village of Kaganayan, Tineg, Abra, in the summer of 1974. Similar ceremonies were recorded also in Manabo in 1975 and in Sal-lapadan in 1976. In Kaganayan the ritual was explained as a community prayer, addressed to the lords of the fields and the rivers and to the spirits of the dead ancestors, asking for rain to solve a major crisis; it had not rained for two months. The people at the time had food for only one meal a day; the corn which they were expecting to harvest had withered and dried out. The Kany- aw (this term in other valleys is applied to any ritual taboo) was led by the village elders and began at the Tineg river bank below the rice fields. The ritual itself was directed by a sha- man, who in the local belief must be a widow without children in order to qualify for the office. The affair proceeded according to tradi- tional procedures with the addition that during the dance, called tadék or salip, the performers dipped their towel-like ceremonial cloth, al-lap, into the waters of the river and sprinkled each other and the audience. The ritual ended with the transfer of the offerings of areca leaves, gawwed, with betel nut, buwa, from the structure, ap-apayag, erect- ed in the center of the dancing ground to the village shrine. There were some minor differences in the ceremony recorded in Manabo; in this village it was called pinagdawat si udan siyan pin-pinaing (petition for rain from the spirits of the village shrine). The ceremony began in the house of the shaman, proceeded to the sacred grove of the shrine and ended on the Abra river bank for the ritual bath. In Sal-lapadan one of the main dancers also dipped a cat into the waters of the Manikbel river. 4. Dawak: A curing ritual This ceremony, recorded in Kugon, Tineg, Abra, in the summer of 1972, was performed on Dominic T. Gaioni behalf of a person whose sickness was diagnos- ed by the shaman as being caused by the spirits of the rice storage, locally referred to as piloy iya alang. The shaman announced that the spirits requested the sacrifice of a pig at the site of the granary. Before slaying the animal, some village leaders struck each of the four posts with the head of the pig and then killed it. First, some meat was cooked and offered to the spirits of the granary, of the house, of the sagsagubayan (a large tree near the village believed to be the spirits' abode) and of Mount Manigo, the high- est mountain in the Tineg district. Some of the meat was mixed with cooked glutinous rice, deket, the type always used for ceremonial purposes, wrapped in banana leaves and placed inside the granary as an offering to the spirits of that structure. The uncooked blood of the pig was mixed with ashes and used to mark the door, the four posts of the storage, and particularly the libeng (a round wooden disk that separates the posts from the main body of the structure to protect it from climbing rats). Health is believed to return to the patient soon after the completion of this ceremony. Rituals dealing with sickness are among the most widespread in the province of Abra. Dawak ist the most common name for them, but other names are also used, depending on the great variety of dialects spoken in the region, on the type of sickness, and on the spiritual source of that sickness. 5. Buni: A ritual for the cure of insanity This ritual was recorded in the village of Nagtu- pakán, Lagangilang, Abra, in the summer of 1976. It was performed on behalf of an individual affected by insanity. It took place at the conflu- ence of two rivers and was led by the shaman, who used the customary array of paraphernalia, except for a small bamboo raft. She began the ceremony with prayers; she then offered the prepared gifts to the spirits, as she begged them to come and take away the person's sickness.

After she led him out of the water, she let him dry in the sun and advised him not to take a bath until a day had passed to prevent the sickness from returning. The shaman then took the bamboo raft, placed it in the water, and, while the patient was holding it, loaded it with a bundle of straw, an earthen rice pot, and the gawwed leaves. When she released the raft, it started float- ing downstream; this, she said, symbolized the spirits' benevolent attitude toward the sick man. She finally sat down and, with half a coco- nut shell filled with sugar cane wine, basi, she offered a toast to the spirits present there before her. At the end of the ceremony she took home a chicken and an amount of money in payment for her services. 6. Begnás: A harvest ritual This ritual, recorded in Tubo, Abra, towards the end of January, 1979, is quite common among the Ma-eng Tingyans of Tubò, Lubo, and Villaviciosa. My informant told me this ceremony is directed to Kabuniyan, the deity most closely connected with the rice culture, as a sign of thanksgiving and as a request for continuous assistance. The ceremony requires a long preparation period and the cooperation of the entire village, sometimes the entire district. While harvest is still in process (usually in the months of December and January), the headmen, manmanakem, of the village call everybody to a meeting at the men's dormitory, called dap-ay, to decide whether a begnas should be celebrated. If the community agrees, a date is set on the basis of omens; the next morning at dawn a group of men is sent to the mountains to an old ritual ground, called mugaw, to ask Apo Kabu- niyan's approval for the community's plans. The journey could last several days. Upon their return from the mountains, they inform the community about the success of their mission through the sound of gongs, (panamattong). Anthropos 80.1985 The elders then send another group of men to catch and sacrifice "one life" (maysa a biag) at the village shrine, locally called papattayan, while a group of ladies prepare the necessary rice. The next phase takes place once again at the yard in front of the men's house where the meat of the sacrifice is anointed three times. Finally a signal is sent to the ladies to bring out the cooked rice for the common meal. The ceremony ends with the customary chanting of oral tradition, singing of salidummay songs and dancing of tadek. This brief presentation of some of the most common ritual manifestations I have encounter- ed among the Abra Tingyans shows the great similarity of ritual procedures observed by this widely scattered ethnic group of Northern Phi- lippines. Rituals differ in details; some elements may be added here and omitted there; names are often interchanged. As to the essential elements, however, the similarities are remark- able: the community, the leaders, the shaman and their needs on one side, the spirits and their power on the other. The relationship is established or renewed through the sacrifice of what is most precious in the eyes of the community and in the sight of the deity, maysa nga biag, an animal's life which symbolizes the community's own life. This event is consummated through the joint participation of humans and superior beings in the sacred meal and sacred dances, symbols of the newly established harmony with- in the entire cosmos. Conclusion I believe this study has come up with at least two significant findings. First of all, it established that, contrary to what several experts during colonial times and some recent social analysts have often predicted, traditional beliefs in small scale, relatively isolated societies reveal a remarkable ability to survive in spite of pro- tracted exposure to external cultural stimuli. Secondly, the study reveals some of the more important factors which contribute to the perpetuation of ancestral belief systems among</page><page sequence="20">400 marginal societies such as the Tingyans of Northern Luzon. The Tingyans found their traditional beliefs and practices the best tools to resist coercive change and preserve cultural identity in the past; and all evidence indicates their ancestors' religion is still their most meaningful approach to cope with the social and economic uncertain- ties of the present. Through Spanish colonization, and later through massive immigration of hispanized groups from the coast, the Tingyans gradually became what was later defined a "cultural minority" in their traditional homeland. Hostile policies during the colonial period relegated them not only to the geographical margin of society but also to a condition of political, economic, and religious subjugation. Resistance to forced change and preserva- tion of ethnic identity and solidarity were best achieved through the vehicle of traditional reli- gious beliefs and practices, as these are the least penetrable by external interference and the easiest to conceal in the face of foreign intru- sion. In the last eighty five years, since the establishment of American control over the islands and the rise of a situation of neo- colonialism after the second World War, the political and economic conditions for the large majority of the Tingyans have remained basical- ly unchanged. On the religious sphere, while there has been less institutionalized hostility towards tra- ditional ritual activities than during the Spanish time, Christian churches have generally been unable and unwilling to explore the richness of the content, the pervasive influence and indeed the intimate relationship of traditional beliefs and practices with every aspect of Tingyan life. To a large extent they failed to devise pastoral approaches that would be not only sensitive to, but also integrative with, the religious views and practices Tingyans received and treasured for hundreds of years. Political turmoil in the past and at present, particularly among the Mountain Tingyans, has been an obstacle to the evangelizing efforts of Christian churches. Other obstacles have been both the methodological approach of the Chur- Dominic T. Gaioni ches in endeavoring to encounter the larger, more hispanized sectors of the population and the assumption that the basic needs of a widely scattered Tingyan population could be satisfied through a system focused on distant parish centers and on the efforts of a very few indivi- duals carrying out the task of visiting some villages once a month and, most of them, only once a year. In the light of the aforementioned social conditions still prevailing in most Tingyan are- as, it is not surprising that they systematically turn to what they know is still the best and most available means to interpret their every day reality in a meaningful way - their traditional religion. The system of Tingyan beliefs and the five categories of ritual activities presented and dis- cussed in this paper make this fact, I believe, abundantly clear. It is impossible to list the names of all those who helped me. Allow me at least to honor and thank the elders of San Quintin/Talamey, Peñarrubia/Patók, Likuwan, Lakub, Tineg. I would also like to give a special word of thanks to the elders and people of Bangilo, who in 1975 found me worthy to be grafted into their intertribal peace and kinship alliance, the Budong System. This essay is dedicated to them and to all the descendants of Lord Kabuniyan. Abstract. - This paper examines the degree and explores the causes for the remarkable survival of tradition- al beliefs and practices among the Tingyans of Northern Philippines. - The study's attempt to understand the Tingyan conception of a three-layered cosmos and their belief in a large pantheon of primal deities and spirit beings is based upon current native knowledge and inter- pretation of mythological accounts and on a region-wide collection of ritual practices. These ceremonies deal with the peoples 's life-cycle , their ailments and the restoration of health, their agricultural activities, the construction and dedication of new physical structures, and the celebrations connected with the intensification, renewal, and establish- ment of social relations. The strength of this type of ancestral beliefs is viewed against the historical back- ground of colonial and neo-colonial conditions in the region. Ethnographic evidence shows that traditional reli- gion was and still is the Tingyans' primary cultural vehicle in coping with external and internal socio-economic pres- sures. - This study is also the fulfillment of a promise to countless Tingyan men and women, old and young, that I would consolidate and publish what they told me. I am far Anthropos 80.1985</page><page sequence="21">The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World from being satisfied with what I have written, and I hope to be able to make further studies, especially in association with future Tingyan scholars.
