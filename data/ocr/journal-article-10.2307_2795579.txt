With a text figure In no country have I noticed so many kinds of 234 scarecrows as in the Batak regions of Sumatra. As soon as the rice crop begins to ripen, they become quite a feature of the landscape. The following kinds were recorded mainly during a short stay among the Timur-Batak, on the shores of Lake Toba, in I934. A. FIXED SCARECROWS These include the types familiar to us: (a) the dead bird of prey, or the tuft of feathers hanging from a post; (b) the anthropomorphic scarecrow. B. MOVING SCARECROWS i. Operated by a watchman The watchman squats on a bamboo platform standing high above the fields; called pasa' by the Timur-Batak, and Pacha- pacha by the Toba-Batak; spelt pansa, and pansa-pansa, respec- tively (fig. ia). 2. Stirred by the wind (a) The gibbet with a rotating arm (d). A pole is planted in the ground; its summit fits loosely into a bamboo joint, allowing it to revolve freely. From the joint knot springs out a bough which forms the arm of the gibbet, and from the extremity of this arm hangs a rag mounted on a horizontal stick. Timur-Batak: hayak- kalak. (b) A similar gibbet, where the place of the rag is taken by a light wooden board, which the wind causes to rotate at great speed (e). Timur Batak: hayak: kayapi. C. Noisy SCARECROWS: WHIZZING OR ROARING A simple windmill device whirling at the top of a pole, and set at right angles to the wind by a vane, commonly a palmleaf (f). Timur-Batak: ingon-ingon; Karo- and Toba-Batak; baling- baling. This is the Javanese kitiran (g). D. NoIsY SCARECROWS: PERCUSSION i. Operated by a watchman, from a pansa (a) The bamboo clapper gaping upwards. A thick bamboo a b C~~ d e I ~ :__ (a) The rotating rod (b). A horizontal bamboo rod pivoting near its thick end at the top of a post stuck in the ground. Round this thick extremity is lasbed a strap of bamboo bark, one end of which is tied to the foot of the pole so as to keep the rod in its horizontal position, while the other end reaches as far as the pansa; by giving it a pull, the watchman causes the stick to swing round, just above the head of the ripening crop. Timur-Batak: hawas hawasi; Karo-Batak: kawat-kawati. (b) A rudimentary network of bamboo straps spreading over the whole field like a bell tent (c). An occasional jerk is imparted to the central pole. Timur-Batak: hotor; Toba-Batak: hotor-hotor. trunk is stuck in the ground, the top part being split so as to form two jaws; one of these has a bamboo strap attached to it so that it can be forced back and released by the man on the pansa. Timur- Batak: bakbak; Toba-Batak: hapak-kapak (h). (b) A similar device, but gaping downwards (i). A section of thick bamboo, split as in the bakbak, is fixed in a reversed position at the top of a stick; the latter is planted in the ground and is jerked by a bamboo strap from the pansa. Timur-Batak: hotuk. A contrivance of a similar kind, from Perak, where it is called kerapak, or garadang, is also shown (j). It consists of a number of bamboo tubes suspended within a frame, and of a wooden bar I55</page><page sequence="2">Nos. 234, 235 Man OCTOBER, I954 hanging horizontally by two bamboo straps. This bar, on being pulled back and released, hits the tubes with great noise. 2. Stirred by the wind The bunch of empty cans and other scraps of tinplate clanging in the wind (k); a modern device, Toba-Batak. In (1) is shown a Kerantong-gantong from Perak. The stick hits the internode of bamboo as the breeze causes the suspension string to wind and unwind. I noted similar contrivances in Java and in Annam, but I cannot say whether the instrument is known to the Batak.2 Often associated with the scarecrows is the sintak, a relative of the Sudanese Mukhbat (described and illustrated by N. L. Corkill inJ.R. Anthrop. Inst., Vol. LXXIII (I943), p. ii8, and Plate VId). It consists of a long and loosely hanging bamboo strap which goes from the pansa to the top of a very high mast. When a flock of birds passes over it, the watchman gives it a sudden pull causing it to fly up, in the hope of crippling or stunning a bird in its flight. Notes 'For greater simplicity of printing and reading, and in accordance with the practice of MAN where the argument does not depend on orthographical nicety, special phonetic letters are not used here.-ED. 2 For the sake of comparison, two interesting groups of scare- crows from Yugoslavia, represented in the Belgrade Ethnological Museum, may be mentioned here: the vetrenjacka, a multiple clapper worked by a windmill, and the ajkalica, a clapper worked by falling water.</page></plain_text>
