<plain_text><page sequence="1">BLURRING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ANIMAL AND HUMAN: ANIMALHUMAN RIGHTS IN "JUAN DARIÉN" BY HORACIO QUIROGA Bridgette W. Gunnels The title of this study suggests multiple questions, ontological as well as moral and ethical. Before blurring any boundaries between what has historically and scientifically been a neat, dyadic relationship, I must explore exactly what are the differences between human beings and ani- mals, and at what moments do each of the entities cross over or blend, becoming hybrid beings possessing shared qualities. And moreover, does the manner in which human beings define themselves have a direct relation to the extension of rights? How do we define ourselves, if not in direct comparison to something we are not? Theorists and philosophers alike from Descartes to Derrida have problematized this 'question of the animal' to such degrees that any dis- cussion here would not even begin to scratch the surface of this most storied of topics. In short, by insisting on defining ourselves in terms of what we are not, we have installed a world of dichotomous beings and non-beings, humans and animals, subjects and objects, selves and Oth- ers who constantly battle for that coveted 50-yard line seat at the center of all things intellectual: who comes first? Nature or culture? Center or periphery? This note briefly makes use of the historical conversations between leagues of others before me regarding the essence of human and animal and how these differ. It also uses as a cornerstone the basic conclusions of recent animal rights theorists as well as those ecocritics who would ponder the issues of nature and culture (or, as Donna Haraway puts it, naturecul- tures). While using the short story "Juan Darién" by Uruguayan author 349</page><page sequence="2">350 ROMANCE NOTES Horacio Quiroga as a naturalcultural allegory, this essay situates recent thoughts on animal rights with the ideas of ecocritics who seek to desta- bilize dichotomous relationships (namely that of nature and culture). This note takes on a natural reading of "Juan Darién" by questioning the notion of 'civilization' on one level, while at the same time presenting readers with serious ethical breaches against a human being (Juan Da- rién the boy) on another, all leading to the culmination of this macabre tale in which the sacrifice of a tiger/boy leads to the physical, spiritual and emotional death of a village and a loss of innocence on an unprece- dented scale. As I interpret it, both human and animal rights are seriously contra- vened in Quiroga 's story, and yet this tale offers more than a surface interpretation of animal rights or welfare. It leads readers to question their own humanity as well as animality, blurring the boundaries that have historically differentiated humans from animals. Although this piece could be read as a metaphorical tool that teaches the consequences of colonization and deculturation in Latin American cultures, a simpler (but by the same token more complex) reading of Quiroga 's work shows it as a fictional illustration of how easily the limits that humans draw between themselves and the animal world can be compromised (and questioned) to a point where one being crosses into another, taking on characteristics, both physical and metaphorical, that would belie the 'true nature' of each. Although cursory mention of the conclusions of Derrida, Wittgen- stein, Bentham, and Freud are important to the theoretical foundation of this note, ecocritical points of view from Donna Haraway as well as ani- mals rights thinkers Cary Wolfe and Peter Singer, are important for set- ting the stage of the nature/culture debate and its place in the creation of cultural artifacts (i.e.-literature). First, however, is a brief summary of "Juan Darién" to illustrate why it is such an appropriate vehicle for inspiring a different approach to the way we consider our relationships with animals. Quiroga tells the story of a young mother who loses her only child to a virus epidemic in the village. She is disconsolate until the night that a baby tiger wanders into her garden. She takes the animal in and gives him shelter and love. She also nurses the baby tiger after feeling the maternal need to cease the grumblings of the little feline's empty stom- ach. At this moment, the young mother and the baby tiger's destinies are</page><page sequence="3">BLURRING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ANIMAL AND HUMAN 3 5 1 fused - her pain and loneliness are eased as the little tiger is magically turned into a small boy. The mother raises the child with all the love she would have offered her own flesh and blood, and it is her compassion and unconditional love which merit her high honor among the animals of the "Universo" (1). Juan Darién grows up and is the hardest working student in the village school, although the other students don't care for him because of his strange appearance. During festival preparations, an inspector arrives at the school for evaluation and suspects that something is wrong with Juan Darién after he hears a strange noise from the little boy - he suspects that he is a sav- age beast after seeing a green, phosphorescent glow from Juan Darién 's eyes. The inspector tries to trick Juan Darién into admitting that he is actually a tiger and not a boy. The story proceeds from there to include the subsequent torture and stoning of the child of only twelve years - everyone takes turns from the smallest children in the village to the old- est sage. They are all convinced that Juan Darién is no human being, but a savage beast that must be exposed. Finally, a tiger-tamer is called in to violently whip the human flesh from the little boy's body (thereby exposing his tiger 'stripes'). Nothing they can do seems to be able to expose the 'tiger' within the little boy, so the village decides to burn him with the fireworks that were set to be used later in the evening. Under the darkness of night, the frail body of the little boy is lit by the fire which burns his flesh until the animal within explodes - and the tiger inside is reborn. Escaping into the forest to try to heal, Juan Darién has time to heal his wounds. Once ready to face the world, he gathers his new group and marches on the city to look for the cruel tiger-trainer. Once he finds him, Juan Darién makes sure that everything that was done to him in the past is revisited on the trainer. In this powerful end- ing, one life is taken for another as the tiger-trainer is burned to death. From the start of this tale, the boundaries typically accepted between human beings and animals are tested. The power of love - a mother's love - is the only measure that can erase the outer, physical evidence of Juan Darién 's 'true' nature. Quiroga tells readers that "Ella era aun muy joven, y podría haberse vuelto a casar, si hubiera querido; pero le basta- ba el amor entrañable de su hijo, amor que ella devolvía con toda su corazón" (2). The young mother raises Juan Darién to be loving, noble and good. He never lies and is a model student and son. His humanity is seemingly of the highest quality. And yet, when the inspector suspects</page><page sequence="4">352 ROMANCE NOTES Juan Danen 's 'true' nature, he immediately determines that "[e]s preciso matar a Juan Darién" (3). Although he was not a "mal hombre," he was like all other humans as Quiroga puts it and "como todos los hombres que viven muy cerca de la selva, odiaba ciegamente a los tigres" (3). The blind fear and hatred towards the animal species is characteristic of many of the human beings in Quiroga 's tales and the quest for domina- tion of land and nature is a salient factor in the lives of Quiroga 's human protagonists. Often, the very animals of the jungle that the human beings are trying to eradicate are responsible for the destruction or death of the humans. In many cases, the animals are not sympathetic towards their pursuers, and indeed organize rebellions to foil or conquer the plans of the intruders. Juan Darién is different from most of the animal protagonists in Quiroga in that the character physically morphs from animal to human and back to animal again in the same story. The first transformation is initiated by the expression of love and compassion by the mother, as Quiroga writes "[t]ú corazón de madre te ha permitido salvar una vida del Universo, donde todas las vidas tienen el mismo valor" (1). When speaking of the "Universo" all lives have the same value, no matter if they are human or non-human. Those who would speak out against ani- mal rights would conclude that animal species do not have language nor possess rationality to understand moral conflict, and thus should not be extended rights of their own. Peter Singer, one of the founders of the modern animal-rights movement, expresses in his treatise, Animal Lib- eration Movement , that such speciesism (or favoritism towards human beings) is the basis for the unnecessary torture of animals for the advancement of the human race. Although Singer would agree that the idea of absolute equality among the species in unachievable, our bench- mark for determining right and wrong in the case of animals should begin with our realization that animal species do have a capacity to suf- fer, and suffering caused by human beings is morally objectionable. Singer takes his cue from eighteenth-century philosopher Jeremy Ben- tham, who argues in his treatise An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (1789) that the day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. [. . .] It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the ter-</page><page sequence="5">BLURRING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ANIMAL AND HUMAN 353 mination of the os sacrum , are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. [. . .] The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk, but, Can they suffer? (7) In Quiroga 's tale, Juan Darién suffers tremendously, and even more, he is made to suffer while in human form and totally without cause. Fur- thermore, it is only by the crescendo of violence perpetuated by the vil- lage inhabitants (all of them, even the children), or, in anthropocentric terms, by their increasing animality, that the human form of Juan Darién is finally burned away: ¡No, perdón! ¡Yo soy hombre! - tuvo aún tiempo de clamar la infeliz criatura. Y tras un nuevo surco de fuego, se pudo ver que su cuerpo se sacudía convulsivamente; que sus gemidos adquirían un timbre profundo y ronco, y que su cuerpo cambiaba poco a poco de forma. Y la muchedumbre, con un grito salvaje de triunfo, pudo ver surgir por fin, bajo la piel del hombre, las rayas negras y fatales del tigre. (5) The graphic nature of the burning of the 12-year old boy seems sacrifi- cial and unnecessary. The capacity to suffer, as Bentham has lain out as the litmus test for determining the margin of difference between man and animal, is clearly exposed. Quiroga's Juan Darién is an "infeliz criatura" who begs for the villagers to quench the fires in which he is put to an agonizing death. Earlier in the story, Juan Darién is also stoned, as the villagers call for his death: "-¡Fuera de aquí, Juan Darién! ¡Vuélvete a la selva, hijo de tigre y corazón de tigre! ¡Fuera, Juan Darién! Y los que estaban lejos y no podían pegarle, le tiraban piedras. Juan Darién cayó del todo, por fin, tendiendo en busca de apoyo sus pobres manos de niño. Y su cruel destino quiso que una mujer, que estaba parada a la puerta de su casa sosteniendo en los brazos a una inocente criatura, interpretara mal ese ademán de súplica. "-¡Me ha querido robar a mi hijo! [. . .] ¡Matémosle en seguida, antes que él mate a nue- stros hijos! - (4)". The fictional fate of Juan Darién is such that readers not only feel sym- pathy for him, but we actually come to abhor the actions of the human villagers against the child and thus condone the death of the tiger-tamer in the end. Our compassion as readers sits, therefore, on the side of the 'animals,' and not the humans. By the end of the story all dichotomies are actually inverted: the humans have exhibited what they themselves</page><page sequence="6">354 ROMANCE NOTES would characterize as animal behavior and the one 'tigre' in this case is depicted as the sacrificial 'lamb' murdered by the stubborn and fearful stupidity of the human beings in the village. As representatives of 'cul- ture' (in other words, civilization), the villagers act savagely against what they view as an intrusion of 'nature' (Juan Darién the tiger) into their cultural microcosm. The desire for segregation between humans and animals is clearly outlined, yet this move towards violent separation begins while Juan Darién was still in human form. As readers, we never witness the animality of Juan Darién until the humanity of the villagers is laid aside in favor of other aspects of their psyche, i.e. fear and the need for domination and superiority. Sigmund Freud dedicates a substantive portion of The Essentials of Psychoanalysis (1923,) to this very subject - how human beings suppress their alter-ego (the id) because it expressly desires to satisfy more animal or "passion- ate" (450) impulses. In the context of this study, Juan Darién, in the pro- tagonist role, has the physicality as well as the emotional range of a human being. It is only when he is under the most dire of circumstances and in direct response to the animal-like mentality of the villagers that the tiger within is brought forth. Even then, the animal in Juan Darién does not wreak havoc on the villagers. Freud's trio of psychological entities (ego, id, superego) offers a vision of both protagonist and antagonist in this short story; Juan Darién and the villagers who burn his human form are all in differing moments of either humanity or animality. The animals and the humans in this story are more aptly viewed as hybrid creatures, or as fusions of nature and culture, animal and human, ego and id. Just as it is ontologically difficult to distinguish the difference between human and animal in the case of the main character, it is equal- ly difficult to characterize the villagers as human beings in a moral and ethical manner because of their treatment of the tiger/boy Juan. Juan Darién does not recognize his duality while in child form, just as the humans do not consider their actions against the boy as animalistic. All they see is that Juan Darién is different, and this difference is an imme- diate source of fear. As Derrida would agree, and as Wolfe has also suc- cinctly rephrased, "the outside is always already inside" (in Zoontologies 29) and in looking for difference we almost always find that all beings end up in the same boat, so to speak. Derrida concludes that [w]hat is this non-power at the heart of power?. . . what right should be accorded it? To what extent does it concern us? [. . .] Mortality resides there, as the most</page><page sequence="7">BLURRING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ANIMAL AND HUMAN 355 radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals, the compas- sion, to the possibility of sharing the possibility of this non-power, the possibili- ty of this impossibility, the anguish of this vulnerability and the vulnerability of this anguish. ("And Say. . ." 130) Derrida surmises that there would be no power without a subject to exert power upon. That is to say, that as human beings we could not define ourselves as different from other species if we did not recognize primari- ly that the human/animal relationship is a dynamic one. Supposed human superiority implies responsibility (or compassion, as Derrida mentions) to those involved in the definition of that superiority. In the case of Juan Darién, the human beings, in effort to secure domination and maintain power (exerting their culture over nature), deny basic rights to Juan Darién the boy and murder his outer human form. This inversion of traditional roles of human and animal is extremely important to the theoretical argument of the essay - if human beings are distinguished from animals by their ability to reason and their language, then Juan Darién was a human. How would we characterize the actions of the humans? Derrida states that we only understand animals in as far as we domesticate or humanize them (in Wolfe, Zoontologies , 123). In Juan's case, the humanity was more present than the animality, yet the village people would not rest until animality was exposed. Does this mean that we all have animals inside? From the fictional point of view, the human beings in Quiroga 's jungle are similar to blurred beings. Their savagery is considered beast-like (from the reader's perspective) and it is only when they are faced with a pure form of humanity (in the child Juan Darién) that these qualities are exposed. All characters in this tale share moments of humanity and animality, and exhibit both compassion and savagery. Another manner in which the boundaries formerly used to distin- guish human and animal are erased in this tale is found in the fact that after Juan Darién the boy is sacrificed to reveal the tiger, he retains cer- tain 'human' traits; namely, the use of his hands, the ability to speak, and the preservation of memory: "Porque había conservado de su forma recién perdida tres cosas: el recuerdo vivo del pasado, la habilidad de sus manos, que manejaba como un hombre, y el lenguaje" (5). This makes Quiroga 's protagonist much more subjective than some of his other animal characters, because although they speak and act among</page><page sequence="8">356 ROMANCE NOTES themselves, it is very rare to find a character that crosses borders and therefore adopts customs and attributes of human beings, including the ability to communicate. Animal rights leaders as well as philosophers have long suggested that the lack of capacity for language is what distin- guishes animals from homo sapiens. Ludwig Wittgenstein ascertains in his seminal work Philosophical Investigations (1958) that "If a lion could talk, we could not understand him" (213). In his essay entitled "In the Shadow of Wittgenstein's Lion: Language, Ethics and the Question of the Animal," Cary Wolfe summarizes the importance of Wittgen- stein's position to present day debate regarding the animal/human ques- tion: Wittgenstein's conventionalism would appear to more or less permanently unsettle the ontological difference between human and animal, a difference expressed, as it were, in the philosophical traditional by the capacity for language: first, by holding that that onto- logical difference is itself constituted by a language that cannot ground and master a world of contingency via 'universais'; and second, by showing how language does not provide an answer to the question 'What's the difference between human and animal?' (Zoontologies 58) Quiroga 's "Juan Darién" delves further in the human and animal ques- tion by developing a story around a type of hybrid animalhuman that possesses speech, cognition and memory, yet at the end of the narration, lives a life ostracized from human society for crimes not committed. Moreover, one of the more interesting factors in the tale is that Juan Darién can speak not only to humans but to the fellow tigers as well. Of course the dialog written by Quiroga between animals is based on human language (a necessary anthropomorphism, I believe). Derrida remarks in his essay "The Animal Therefore I Am" that philosophers from Aristotle to Lacan, Kant, Heidegger and Lévinas all say the same thing: the animal is without language. Or more precisely unable to respond, to respond with a response that could be precisely and rigorously distinguished from a reaction. (400) In Quiroga 's tale, of course, Juan Darién possesses not only language, but the ability to respond decisively to a full range of situations. Before the death of his mother, Juan Darién was a model student in the village school, performing at high levels. He was an 'animal' that was respon-</page><page sequence="9">BLURRING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ANIMAL AND HUMAN 357 sive to positive input - the unconditional love of his mother. After her death and the death of his physical form, Juan Darién responds with revenge upon the author of his human death, the tiger tamer. Quiroga 's protagonist provides us with the perfect fictional tool to examine the boundaries that human beings install to distinguish ourselves from the 'others.' The moral lesson from this tale lies in the misjudgment on part of the villagers of the true 'nature' of Juan Darién and to show that things are not always as cut and dried as human beings would like for them to be. The animals in this story are actually few, but from an objec- tive perspective, they possess more humanistic qualities than any of the humans in the story, save the mother of the protagonist, of course. Quiroga 's expertise at exposing the frailty of the human condition vis a vis the natural world is his trademark - some of his best works describe the mistakes and trials of pioneer life in the northeastern corner of Argentina, Misiones. However, Quiroga 's work adroitly challenges anthropocentrism by giving life to his animal protagonists and envision- ing them as not only sentient members of our world but acting of their own volition and exhibiting a full-range of emotions, thus eroding the neat categories and divisions that previously have formed the boundaries between human being and animal. Science convinces us that animals are different from human beings because they primarily lack rationality, which is an argument that is fortified by the fact that animals 'lack' the ability to express themselves linguistically in a manner that is fully com- prehensible to us. Although many will accept that animals are capable of reactionary episodes, a responsive reaction is deemed lacking, thus many concede that certain rights cannot be granted to animals. My question is, and this is related more to Wittgenstein's quote from earlier, is it possible that animals are just as evolved as human beings? Is their 'silence' (i.e. -lack of language) a response to the cacophony creat- ed by human beings? Day to day animals teach us to stop, slow down and really listen. It is through this process that human beings can 'hear' animals. Donna Haraway suggests a similar argument in The Compan- ion Species Manifesto (2003) when she writes about her relationship with her dog, Ms. Cayenne Pepper: In layers of history, layers of biology, layers of naturecultures, complexity is the name of our game. We are both the freedom-hungry offspring of conquest, products of white set- tler colonies, leaping over hurdles and crawling through tunnels on the playing field. I'm</page><page sequence="10">358 ROMANCE NOTES sure our genomes are more alike than they should be. There must be some molecular record of our touch in the codes of living that will leave traces in the world. [. . .] Signifi- cantly other to each other, in specific difference, we signify in the flesh a nasty develop- mental infection called love. This love is an historical aberration and a naturalcultural legacy. (2-3) Haraway touches the cornerstone of the argument of this note - that maybe humans and animals are not as different as we would like for them to be and that the boundaries that we form serve the purpose of establishing for ourselves that human beings hold a higher place in the natural order. Quiroga, via his work in "Juan Darién," effectively shows us that these boundaries are not as clear cut as they would seem. Metaphorically speaking, Juan Darién shows us how complexity and hybridity are perhaps more accurate portraits of the natural and cultural worlds that we cross into and out of daily.
